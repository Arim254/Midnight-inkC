    "body": "\n        In 2010, Sidney Crosby propelled the Canada men's hockey team to a gold medal after scoring the game-winning goal in overtime against Team USA. On Sunday, though, Crosby looked on from the sideline as Jack Hughes' overtime goal lifted the Americans to a 2-1 win over Canada as Team USA won the gold for the first time since 1980. Crosby missed Canada's final two games of the Olympics after he sustained a lower-body injury during the quarterfinals. He said that the decision to sit out Canada's eventual loss to Team USA was his and his alone. \"I was pretty close,\" he said. \"I mean, ultimately I wasn't able to go out there and do what I needed to do in order to help the team, so at that point, you've got to make a decision that's best for the group. Not an easy one. But, you know, that's hockey.\"Crosby, a three-time Stanley Cup champion with the Pittsburgh Penguins who also helped the Canadians win the gold medal in 2014, said that this Canada team deserved a better outcome than what ultimately unfolded on Sunday. \"I think everyone should be proud the way the team performed,\" he said. \"I thought that, obviously, we did everything but score. In every facet, we were just so good today. I thought we deserved better, and unfortunately, you know, didn't come away at the win.\" Canada's Nathan McKinnon was a little more blunt during his postgame presser. \n\"You be the judge of who was the better team today,\" said McKinnon, who missed a golden chance to give Canada a 2-1 lead in the third period.Crosby's absence was certainly felt, especially on the offensive end. Canada got just one of its 42 shots past Connor Hellebuyck and were unable to take advantage of an extended 5-on-3 power play in the second period. The Canadians lost despite out-shooting the Americans, 42-26.\n        \n            \n                Team USA honors Johnny Gaudreau after defeating Canada to win the gold medal\n                \n                    Bryan DeArdo                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTeam USA got on the board first on Matt Boldy's first-period goal. Cale Makar tied things up in the second, and the game went into overtime after neither team was able to score during the third period. The Americas captured gold during the 3-on-3 overtime when Zach Werenski fed Jack Hughes for the game-winning goal.Crosby said that he was \"really proud\" of his team despite Sunday's outcome. \n\"I thought that the way we played all tournament, even the games leading up, I thought we were really good,\" he said. \"We were tested in some of those games. It's not easy to get to this point, and we just found ways. I thought one of our best games was probably today. And unfortunately, it doesn't work out for us. But I'm just really proud of the group and the way we competed and the way we played.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Shortly after winning America's first gold medal in men's hockey in 46 years, members of Team USA honored Johnny Gaudreau, a former Team USA member who tragically died in August of 2024. Zach Werenski, who played alongside Gaudreau during his final NHL seasons with the Columbus Blue Jackets, held up Gaudreau's Team USA jersey along with team captain Auston Matthews and assistant captain Matthew Tkachuk shortly after he fed Jack Hughes for the game-winning goal against Canada. The gesture occurred with members of Gaudreau's family looking on in the stands. \nAfter receiving their gold medals, Werenski and Dylan Larkin, who played with Gaudreau at multiple world championships, brought Gaudreau's young children out to the ice for a team photo. \n\"It means everything -- we all know he should be here with us,\" Larkin said of Gaudreau prior to the gold medal game. \"He should be with us. We love him, and I like that we continue to think about him and I wouldn't imagine it any other way.\"\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Johnny and his younger brother Matthew Gaudreau were killed after being stuck being an alleged drunk driver while cycling in New Jersey. Like his older brother, Matthew Gaudreau was also an accomplished hockey player who played professionally in the AHL and ECHL before becoming a coach. A seven-time NHL All-Star, Johnny Gaudreau was a six-time All-Star for the Calgary Flames. He was the 2017 recipient of the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy, which is given annually to an NHL player \"adjudged to have exhibited the best type of sportsmanship and gentlemanly conduct combined with a high standard of playing ability.\"\nIn 2022, Gaudreau shocked most of the hockey world by deciding to sign with the Blue Jackets as a free agent. He was named to his seventh and ultimately final All-Star team during his first season in Columbus, who has continued to honor his legacy following his untimely death. Gaudreau helped Team USA win the gold medal at the 2013 IIHF Junior World Championships. He most recently played on Team USA during the 2024 IIHF World Championship. He never got a chance to play in the Olympics, though, as the NHL did not participate in the previous two Olympics. \"He wanted to be on this team,\" his father, Guy Gaudreau, said during the third period of the America's win over Slovakia. \"And it would've been nice if he'd been here.\"\nMembers of the Gaudreau family made the trip to Italy after being invited by Team USA. \"Our two daughters, for 24 hours, they just kept at us: 'You have to go. The boys would want you to do this. This would mean so much to John,'\" said Gaudreau's mother, Jane. \"It just means so much to our family, and we're so excited to remember what our boys meant to hockey.\"Their presence was certainly felt by Team USA. \"It's great having them here, and it's super special,\" Werenski said prior to Sunday's game. \"We're happy that we made it to the gold medal game so they can watch that and be a part of it. It's on us to make them proud.\"\nGaudreau served as inspiration throughout the Olympics for Team USA. His uniform was on the locker room throughout the Olympics, and it was on the ice on Sunday when the Americans made history by winning the gold medal for only the third time. \"He was one of America's very best,\" said Team USA coach Mike Sullivan. \"He's just a good person on the ice and off the ice, and I think he's an inspiration to our players to this very day.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Midway through the second quarter on Sunday afternoon in Columbia, Raven Johnson sprung a trap. Matched up against Cotie McMahon in the corner, Johnson watched and waited while Ole Miss ran a pick-and-roll up top. Then, just as Kaitlin Peterson picked up her dribble and turned to throw the ball out to McMahon, Johson jumped into the passing lane for a steal and took the ball coast-to-coast for a layup. Johnson's bucket put South Carolina ahead by 11, and the Gamecocks led by double digits the rest of the way en route to a dominant 85-48 win that secured the SEC regular season title for the fifth season in a row. Though Johnson only finished with six points in the victory -- tied for the fifth-highest total for the Gamecocks -- she showed why she deserves to be a first-round pick in the 2026 WNBA Draft. \nJohnson's WNBA stock has fluctuated throughout her time in college. She helped the Gamecocks win the national championship as a redshirt junior in 2024, and drew rave reviews for her defense against Caitlin Clark in the title game. However, she was unable to build on that momentum last season, and after a disappointing campaign on a personal level, she decided to use her extra year of eligibility to return to school rather than turn pro. That proved to be a wise decision. Johnson has bounced back with the best season of her career: 9.8 points, 4.2 rebounds, 5.4 assists and 1.7 steals on 48.7/35.2/84.1 shooting splits. Those aren't gaudy numbers, and Johnson can still be inconsistent as a scorer, as we saw Sunday, but it's everything else that's going to make her a first-round pick. \n\n        \n            \n                2026 WNBA Draft Big Board 1.0: Awa Fam and Olivia Miles stand alone in first tier, UCLA stars dominate top 10\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"I think that Raven Johnson does not get the credit that she should. I think she is the best point guard in the country,\" Ole Miss coach Yolett McPhee-McCuin said Sunday after Johnson's excellent two-way performance, which included seven assists, three steals and just one turnover. Shutting down McMahonJohnson is best known for her defense, so let's start on that side of the ball. She spent most of Sunday shadowing McMahon, Ole Miss's leading scorer and another potential first-round pick in this year's WNBA draft. McMahon entered the game averaging 20.7 points, and was coming off 39- and 25-point performances. Her hot streak came to an abrupt end\nJohnson helped hold McMahon to a season-low two points on 0 of 9 from the field. This was just the second time in McMahon's career that she's played at least 10 minutes and failed to make a shot, and her two points were tied for the third-fewest in her career. Johnson is only 5-foot-9, but she has a 6-foot-2 wingspan, which is a real benefit against bigger players like the 6-foot McMahon. Throughout the game, Johnson got right into McMahon's space and prevented her from getting anything going off the dribble. Here, early in the third quarter, Johnson picks McMahon up fullcourt and forces her to give up the ball early. Because McMahon is only just inside the halfcourt line, her pass to the wing is longer than usual, which gives Ta'Niya Latson time to pick it off. Johnson doesn't get any credit for this turnover in the box score, but she caused it. \nA few possessions later, McMahon doesn't even try to bring the ball up the floor and throws it ahead instead. She gets it back near the top of the key, but Johnson's pressure immediately forces her backwards, and then Johnson pokes the ball away for what should have been another turnover. \n\"I thought our players did a great job, Raven especially,\" South Carolina coach Dawn Staley said of her team's job defending McMahon. \"The first line of that defense was so hard, that took her vision down, that occupied her dribble. Raven's the very best at it.\"Johnson's ability to mirror McMahon's movements and weave around screens also made it difficult for Ole Miss to get McMahon going off the ball. Here, in the second quarter, Johnson fights through traffic to get a deflection on a baseline out of bounds play and forces Ole Miss to take the ball out again in the deep corner. \nThere is no better point of attack defender in this class than Johnson, and as the WNBA leans more into spacing and 3-point shooting over the coming years, that is going to become an even more valuable skill. \"Unafraid of a challenge, is willing -- she knows. Like, she knew she was gonna have to guard Cotie, she knew she was gonna have to guard Mikayla Blakes. She knows she's gonna have to guard our opponents' best perimeter [players], and sometimes small, power forwards,\" Staley said of Johnson's defensive impact. \"We're unafraid to switch if need be because we know Raven's gonna give it her best shot at defending and making it difficult for people. I see it. I don't think she gets credit enough for what she's been doing over her career... She doesn't have the numbers and the steals and the blocks that we look at... If you really look at what makes our team go defensively, it starts and ends with Raven.\"An improved playmakerJohnson's perimeter defense has never been a secret, but there have been questions about her offense. Though she is shooting a career-high 35.2% from 3-point range (on just 2.4 attempts per game), she still offers little as a scorer. Johnson has made real strides as a playmaker, though, and now looks much more like a viable point guard at the next level. \nShe finished with seven assists against Ole Miss and easily could have been in double figures in that category if her teammates had helped her out. Johnson excels in transition, as we saw time and again Sunday. The weight of her passes were excellent and allowed her bigs to catch the ball in stride to either go up and finish or get fouled. This one in the third quarter to Alicia Tournebize stood out. \nShe also showed that she could make high-level passes in the halfcourt, such as this backdoor feed to Tessa Johnson (which should have been converted) and this pocket pass to Madina Okot. \nAdditionally, Johnson only had one turnover on Sunday. She's averaging 1.6 this season and for her career has just 196 turnovers in 3,485 minutes over 143 games. One of the most impressive stats about Johnson's ability to take care of the ball is that she has 42 games without a turnover, and she played 20-plus minutes in 26 of those contests. Would WNBA teams like to see more from Johnson offensively? Sure. In particular, can she become even more consistent from behind the arc to command attention when she doesn't have the ball? But in an expanding league that's already lacking point guard depth, Johnson's ability to run an offense without making mistakes -- combined with her elite defense -- is going to be attractive to teams. \"Raven Johnson is a winner,\" Staley said after South Carolina defeated LSU earlier this month. \"Like, look it up in the dictionary, look it up on your iPhones, Raven Johnson is a winner. She makes plays. Winning plays... She's probably the one that I'll miss the most out of all the players that I've coached.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Arsenal restored their five-point lead atop the Premier League table with a 4-1 win at Tottenham Hotspur in the North London Derby on Sunday, taking full advantage of their injury-riddled opponents in a must-win match.Though Spurs returned to play for the first time since hiring Igor Tudor to replace Thomas Frank, the match went as expected for two sides in full contrast. Arsenal dictated play and were rewarded with a 32nd-minute goal from Eberechi Eze, who scored from close range as a frantic Spurs defense failed to cope with the Gunners' attacking charge. The visitors' lead was gone in a matter of two minutes courtesy of Randal Kolo Muani, who won possession on the left side of the penalty area and then cut inside for a strike right in front of goal.The stat sheet at halftime was reflective of the realities that the visitors were in the midst of a title charge and the hosts are technically staving off relegation and entered the weekend with 13 fit senior team players, as well as Spurs' stylistic tendencies. With only two true attack-minded players on the pitch and boasting a roster that, even at full fitness, is not built to be an offensive might, they had just two shots and 0.29 expected goals at the halftime break. Arsenal, meanwhile, took full advantage of an understaffed Spurs defense that was missing the suspended Cristian Romero and the injured Kevin Danso and had 12 shots and one expected goal.Things finally tipped in the Gunners' favor in the second half, first with Viktor Gyokere's impressive strike from distance in the 47th minute and then Eze's second strike in the 61st minute, the England international capitalizing on a sloppy moment from Spurs' defense along the way. In between Arsenal's second-half goals, Spurs thought they had an equalizer through Kolo Muani but he was called for a push on Gabriel in the process of scoring.\nSpurs attempted a attacking surge towards the end of the match, substitute Richarlison managing two shots in the dying minutes of the match, but their efforts did not pay off and in one of the final moments of the match, Gyokeres completed a brace of his own to ensure the Gunners would take all three points home.Eze, who joined Arsenal this summer from Crystal Palace and nearly signed with Tottenham, scored a hat trick against Spurs earlier this season.\nThis is Arsenal's first Premier League win in three, their grip on first place slipping slightly over the process. They finish the weekend five points ahead of Manchester City, who kept pace with a 2-1 win over Newcastle United on Saturday and also have a game in hand.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Kentucky dropped its third consecutive game Saturday in a 75-74 loss at Auburn, and it came in controversial fashion. Coach Mark Pope was audibly frustrated with the officials who whistled the Wildcats for a pivotal foul which set up a game-winning bucket for Auburn's Elyjah Freeman. After dancing around criticism of the officials during his postgame media availability, Pope could be heard on a hot mic laying into the SEC and the crew that called the contest.\"If those mother-effers try to fine me, screw 'em,\" Pope said after he left the media room. \"I did not say a word about how they cheated us.\"Pope's frustration stemmed from a critical call with 14.3 seconds to play. Leading by a point, the Wildcats inbounded from underneath their own basket when a whistle blew the play dead. Officials called Collin Chandler for an offensive foul when he shoved Auburn's Kevin Overton to the floor to gain separation. While Chandler clearly extended both arms on the shove, Pope was bewildered by the call.In Kentucky's defense, there was mutual contact between the players. Overton wrapped one of his arms around Chandler's back before the push-off for what could have been called a holding foul.\nBefore his comments on the hot mic, Pope addressed the situation with care not to place direct blame on the officials.\"We're not allowed to talk about the referees, but you guys saw it, and I think sometimes it's just super personal,\" Pope said. \"I'm not allowed to comment on the referees. I won't comment on the referees. It's unfortunate. It didn't cost us the game. We're in control of the game, so we'll find ways to go win.\"The foul turned the ball over to Auburn, which scored a game-winning basket on the ensuing possession. KeShawn Murphy missed a close-range shot, but Freeman flew in for the rebound and tipped in a putback with 1.1 seconds remaining, pushing the Tigers on top by a point.\n\"We refuse to give control to people that are outside of our program,\" Pope said. \"Refuse. Regardless of how personal it might get or how bad it might get. We refuse to give control to fans, to give control to anybody else associated with this game, regardless of how blatantly people are trying to make this not happen.\"We're not giving away our power. We're not. We don't make excuses. We don't do that regardless of what is happening, regardless of how disgraceful things are. We don't give away our power regardless of how embarrassing, personal, awful, unacceptable things are. We refuse to give away our power.\"Every loss for Kentucky adds to the disappointment of what initially projected to be a national championship-contending season. The Wildcats slipped to 17-10 with the defeat and are a projected No. 6 seed in the NCAA Tournament, per CBS Sports bracketology.\n            ",

    "body": "\nA consequential week awaits in Europe as the UEFA Champions League's knockout phase playoffs continue with a batch of second leg matches, several of which will be fiercely contested with spots in the round of 16 on the line.Three first leg matches concluded in a draw or with a team boasting a narrow one goal advantage, a trip to the next round no sure thing for several high-profile teams.

They have made it to the round of 16 on all but two occasions in the last 12 seasons and are still the favorites to advance on Tuesday but after last week's 3-3 draw at Club Brugge, reaching the next round is no guarantee. The Belgian side went toe-to-toe with Atleti, revealing some of their opponent's shortcomings in the process. Diego Simeone's side still boasts a handful of talented goalscorers, headlined by Antoine Griezmann and Julian Alvarez, the pair supported by impactful players like Alexander Sorloth and new signing Ademola Lookman. Their defensive performances, though, have been all over the place – they have one clean sheet in their last five, a 4-0 win against Barcelona in the Copa del Rey, conceding nine goals in that stretch. Brugge have sneakily been a strong attacking side in the Champions League with 15 goals in eight league phase matches, gifted at finding a way to exploit vulnerable defenses.Are Italian sides in trouble?: Coupled with Juventus' first leg capitulation at Galatasaray, Inter's tie with Bodo/Glimt will serve as a bellwether for the state of the game in Italy, the pressure fully on the Serie A leaders after losing 3-1 in Norway last week. Glimt are riding a high after beating both Manchester City and Atleti in recent weeks and have the benefit of a familiarity with Aspmyra Stadion's artificial turf but even then, Inter failed to match the tempo of the opponent in the first leg and return home with a sizable disadvantage. They rebounded in domestic play with a 2-0 win at Lecce but may have to cope without Lautaro Martinez, who came off with a calf injury at Glimt and missed Saturday's match and may be at risk of missing Tuesday's Champions League encounter. They will likely count on Marcus Thuram to lead their attacking charge but Inter have not exactly an attacking force in Europe with 15 goals during the league phase, an average tally during those eight games, a worrying sign for a team in need of goals on Tuesday.Wednesday's storylinesReal Madrid's up-and-down season: From a results standpoint, things were coming up Real Madrid last week – their win over Real Sociedad and Barcelona's defeat to Girona meant they took top spot in LaLiga, while a 1-0 win at Benfica means they have an important advantage heading into the second leg. Their four-match win streak came to an end on Saturday, though, with a 2-1 loss at Osasuna, a game that served as a reminder of the team's longstanding issues. There's a longstanding imbalance to Los Blancos' squad, even as coach Alvaro Arbeloa commits to playing Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Junior alongside each other. The strategy works sometimes but is far from foolproof, as was the case on Saturday – they only managed 1.7 expected goals from 15 shots at Osasuna, while the hosts had 2.29 xG from 13 shots. There is no reason to expect Arbeloa to drop Mbappe and Vinicius when Benfica come to town on Wednesday but against a visiting side that limited Madrid's offense to just 0.89 xG from 17 shots, finding the correct balance may be an all-important task for the coach.Paris Saint-Germain bounce back:Paris Saint-Germain entered their first leg at Monaco with just four wins in their last eight and a chance to end their rut, which they did – even if it was the hard way. An early brace from U.S. international Folarin Balogun ensured PSG had to come back from a 2-0 deficit in order to come out with a first leg advantage, while a 3-0 win over Metz on Saturday ensured they would have more wind in their sails in time for Wednesday's second leg. They will have to manage against Monaco without Ousmane Dembele, who came off early in the first leg with an injury and may still be unavailable on Wednesday, leaving Luis Enrique to call upon the likes of Desire Doue and Achraf Hakimi to hold down the attacking fort.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        In a career that has been filled with memorable moments, Pat Riley made history once again on Sunday by becoming the first Los Angeles Lakers coach to receive a statue. Riley, who has served as the Miami Heat's president since 1995, was back in Los Angeles this weekend as the Lakers made him the eighth member of the franchise to receive a statue outside Crypto.com Arena. Riley won six NBA titles with the Lakers that included one as a player, one as an assistant coach and four as head coach during franchise's iconic \"Showtime\" era during the 1980s. The statue depicts Riley with his patented slicked back hair and dressed in one of his tailored Armani suits. The statue also includes the following quote Riley that has long attributed to his father, the same quote he referenced during his famous pregame speech that helped spearhead the Lakers' comeback over the Boston Celtics during the 1985 NBA Finals: \"There will come a time when you are challenged. And when that time comes, you must plant your feet. You must stand firm. You must make a point. About who you are, what you do, and where you come from. And when that time comes, you do it.\" \nSeveral prominent figures in Lakers history spoke at the statue unveiling, including \"Showtime\" stars Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Shaquille O'Neal, a fellow former Lakers great who won a title with Riley with the Heat in 2006, also spoke in a video that was played. Dwyane Wade, who led the Heat to that championship victory over the Dallas Mavericks, also spoke at the ceremony. Heat owner Micky Arison was also in attendance. O'Neal, during his speech, recalled a practice where he confronted Riley, who stood his ground. \n\"I remember thinking, 'Oh, this man is different.'\" O'Neal recalled. \"You don't build dynasties if you're afraid of personalities, and Pat was never afraid.\"O'Neal also confirmed that Riley -- a master motivator -- did indeed dunk his head in a bucket of freezing water and held his breath for more than four minutes in an effort to galvanize his team. \"Finally, he came up, gasping for air, and said, 'We cannot win unless we treat it as if it's our last breath,'\" O'Neal recalled. \"That's how he coached. Everything urgent, everything intense, everything championship level. And that mentality, that's why this statue belongs here.\" \nJohnson, who became arguably the greatest point guard in NBA history under Riley's watch, called on the other \"Showtime\" members in the audience to stand while giving his speech. \nJeanie Buss, the governor and minority owner of the Lakers, also spoke while reference what her farther, the late Dr. Jerry Buss, said of Riley during his 2010 induction into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\"Dr. Buss was right of course. Pat really was a guardian angel for this franchise, its employees, and most important, its fans across the world,\" she said. \nA tenacious, blue collar player who played for the legendary Adolph Rupp at Kentucky, Riley was a member of the 1972 Lakers team that won a then-NBA record 69 regular season games and continues to hold the NBA record with 33 consecutive games. He then dabbled in broadcasting before winning a title in 1980 as Paul Westhead's assistant. Riley was promoted to head coach during the 1982 season and quickly guided the Lakers to another NBA title. The Lakers then lost consecutive NBA Finals that included a gut-wrenching loss the Celtics in 1984 in a classic series that went the distance. In what was arguably his greatest coaching moment, Riley led the Lakers to a six-game series win over the Celtics in the 1985 NBA Finals after Los Angeles lost by 34 points in Game 1 in a game that was immediately dubbed \"The Memorial Day Massacre.\" Riley's passionate leadership appeared to have a significant impact on Abdul-Jabbar, who at age 38 was named the MVP of the series after leading the Lakers to their first championship series win over the Celtics. \nTwo years later, the Lakers defeated the Celtics in the NBA Finals on the strength of Johnson, who was named the MVP of the regular season and the Finals after Riley directed him at the start of the season to become the focal point of the offense from a scoring standpoint, something that point guards of that era seldom did. \"I said, 'Did you ask Kareem?'\" Johnson jokingly recalled saying to Riley during his speech. \"He pushed me to a whole other level. ... Pat was way ahead of his time in coaching.\" During the team's victory celebration, Riley famously guaranteed the Lakers would successfully defend their title. It wasn't easy, by the Lakers did defeat the Pistons in a classic seven-game series to become the NBA's first repeat champion in 19 years. \nRiley later enjoyed successful coaching stops with the New York Knicks and Miami Heat. In 1994, he led the Knicks to their first NBA Finals appearance in 21 years. In Miami, he coached the Heat to their first title before overseeing the franchise's last two championship wins as team president. \"Pat could build different identities in different cities,\" Wade said during his speech. \"Showtime to grit, it's the same standard, it's the same leadership. Just a little different style.\" As he concluded his speech, Riley fittingly alluded to the Lakers' arch rival, whom they would face yet again later in the day. \n\"The time has come to kick some ass,\" Riley told the crowd. \"The time has come to kick some Boston ass.\" \n            ",

The Magic cruised past the Clippers 129-101 at home in November to end their four-game losing streak in the all-time series.Meanwhile, the Warriors (29-27) hope to get on track when they host the Denver Nuggets (36-21) at 3:30 p.m. ET at the Chase Center in San Francisco. Golden State has lost back-to-back contests and eight of 12 since enjoying a four-game winning streak in mid-January.More than 20 games are on Sunday's college basketball slate, one of which is a Big Ten Conference clash that has Iowa (19-7) facing No. 24 Wisconsin (18-8) at 4 p.m. ET at the Kohl Center in Madison. The Hawkeyes are seeking their second straight victory against a ranked opponent after getting past No. 9 Nebraska 57-52 last Tuesday.The Nuggets are 6.5-point favorites against the Warriors in the latest consensus NBA odds, while the Celtics are 1.5-point favorites against the Lakers. The Clippers are 2.5-point favorites over the Magic and Wisconsin is a 3.5-point favorite against Iowa.Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Sunday, Feb. 22. All times EasternNBA best bets, where to watchNuggets at WarriorsTime: 3:30 p.m. | Location: San Francisco | TV: ABC | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Warriors +6.5 (-113) | Expert: Gui Santos Over 11.5 points (-123, PropBetGuy)The Nuggets were edged by the Clippers 115-114 in their return from the All-Star break but rebounded the following night, demolishing the Portland Trail Blazers by 54 points. Denver set a franchise record for most points in a road game with 157 in that victory. The Warriors have suffered back-to-back losses, but the SportsLine Projection Model doesn't believe they'll get trounced like Portland did as they cover the spread in 62% of its simulations. Golden State's Gui Santos is averaging only six points per game this season but has recorded at least 13 in seven of his last eight outings, and SportsLine props expert PropBetGuy (98-71, +1537 on his last 169 NBA player prop picks) likes the trend to continue. The 23-year-old forward faces a Denver defense that forces the action to secondary scorers and allows spot-up shots as the third-highest frequency in the league.Celtics at LakersTime: 6:30 p.m. | Location: Los Angeles | TV: NBC | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Celtics -131 | Expert: Payton Pritchard Over 5.5 assists (-139, Larry Hartstein)The Celtics are 18-10 on the road this season and have won three straight away from home. The Lakers were without both LeBron James and Luka Doncic in their 21-point loss at Boston earlier this season, but the SportsLine Projection Model doesn't think their presence on Sunday will be enough as its simulations have the Celtics winning 70% of the time. Payton Pritchard, who is averaging 5.4 assists this campaign, registered six in the first meeting with the Lakers also had a half-dozen against the Warriors on Thursday. SportsLine expert Larry Hartstein thinks the 28-year-old guard will reach that total against a Lakers squad that is allowing the eighth-most assists (27.5) per contest this season.Magic at ClippersTime: 9 p.m. | Location: Inglewood, Cal. | TV: NBA TV | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine pick -- Model: Clippers -135The Clippers will be looking to avenge their 28-point loss in Orlando and post their fifth victory in six meetings with the Magic. They'll definitely be more rested for this matchup as they last played on Friday while Orlando is coming off a 113-110 double-overtime loss to the Suns in Phoenix on Saturday night. The SportsLine Projection Model has the Clippers winning in 72% of its simulations.CBB best bets, where to watchIowa at No. 24 WisconsinTime: 4 p.m. | Location: Madison, Wisc. | TV: FS1 | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Over 147.5 (-109) | Expert: Wisconsin -2.5 (-110, Bruce Marshall)The Hawkeyes are the top defensive team in the Big Ten and ninth in the nation as they are allowing an average of 64.4 points. However, they yielded 70 or more points in four consecutive games before holding Nebraska to 52 last time out. The Badgers are third on the conference in scoring at 83.1 points per contest despite their 69-point effort in last Tuesday's loss to Ohio State and are 15th defensively in the 18-team Big Ten with an average of 76.0 points allowed. With all of that taken into account, the SportsLine Projection Model sees this matchup being an offensive battle as its simulations have the Over hitting well over 76% of the time. Wisconsin posted double-digit victories in each of its last two home games, and SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall feels the Badgers will at least cover the spread against Iowa.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Michigan State and Ohio State will meet for the first time on the hardwood this season Sunday on CBS in a pivotal Big Ten showdown with NCAA Tournament seeding and conference championship implications on the line. The two teams enter the day having won earlier in the week -- Michigan State over UCLA and Ohio State over Wisconsin, respectively -- setting up what should be a terrific matchup from East Lansing.Michigan State has been tough to beat on its homecourt this season, but it has not been infallible. It is 13-2 in games played in the Breslin Center, with both losses coming to teams ranked inside the top five. That should inspire at least a little confidence in the Buckeyes, who are in desperate need of stringing together some momentum after alternating between wins and losses in their last nine outings.Where to watch Ohio State vs. Michigan State liveDate: Sunday, Feb. 22 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: Breslin Center -- East Lansing, MichiganTV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App, Paramount+ Premium  Ohio State vs. Michigan State: Need to knowBig Ten title hopes: Michigan State enters Sunday 3.5 games back of Michigan in the Big Ten standings and likely needs to run the regular-season table to be in contention for a conference title. Given the way the Wolverines have played, it seems farfetched, but the Spartans can't lose sight of the goal against a Buckeyes team that could be easy to overlook if not taken seriously. Consistently inconsistent: Ohio State has alternated between winning and losing in its last nine games dating back more than a month, proving to be consistent only in its inconsistency. A win Sunday would be its first two-game winning streak since mid-January. It is coming off an 86-69 home win over Wisconsin.\nFearsome Fears: Michigan State guard Jeremy Fears Jr. leads all of college basketball in assists per game (9.3) and also leads his team in minutes and points per game with 31.6 and 15.1, respectively. He's made a significant jump in production from last season and is coming off his fourth consecutive double-double in which he had 16 points and 10 assists in an 82-59 win over UCLA.Ohio State vs. Michigan State prediction, pickOdds below via FanDuel Sportsbook\nMichigan State's 13-2 at home this season and 7-5-1 against the spread as home favorites. I'm taking the Spartans to win and would probably lay the points with them as they prep for their penultimate home game of the season. The way Fears has played of late should inspire confidence, but more than that, this Michigan State team has leveled up defensively, too. If they can find a way to slow Bruce Thornton they can win -- and perhaps handily. Pick: Michigan State -9 \n\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            MSU -9\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Ohio St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Ohio St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Ohio St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Ohio St.\n                    \n    \n    SU\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    Who will win and cover in every college basketball game? Visit SportsLine to get picks from the model that simulates each game 10,000 times and is up more than $1,200 for $100 players on its top-rated spread picks the past six years. \n            ",

Hughes scored the game-winning goal in overtime against Canada to lift the Americans to their first gold medal since 1980.Team USA and Canada battled to a 1-1 tie at the end of regulation, and this gold medal matchup for the ages went to 3-on-3 overtime, where Hughes asserted himself as a national hero. After out-muscling Nathan MacKinnon for a loose puck, Zach Werenski found Hughes coming down the weak side. Presented with a chance to end the game, Hughes didn't miss as he fired a shot past the glove of Jordan Binnington.Connor Hellebuyck was undoubtedly the Americans' best player on Sunday. Hellebuyck played the best game of his career, stopping 41 of 42 Canadian shots and making some miraculous stops when the United States needed them most. Hellebuyck lived up to his billing as the best goalie in the world.Meanwhile, the Canadians missed one opportunity after another to win the game. Canada failed to score on an extended 5-on-3 power play in the second period, Devon Toews was stopped by the stick of Hellebuyck with a wide open net in front of him and Nathan MacKinnon missed on a glorious opportunity to give his team a 2-1 lead.Team USA took advantage of those Canadian miscues and finished its Olympic run with the country's first gold medal in 46 years.U.S. men's hockey scoresAll times EasternPreliminary roundThursday, Feb. 12: USA 5, Latvia 1Saturday, Feb. 14: USA 6, Denmark 3Sunday, Feb. 15: USA 5, Germany 1QuarterfinalWednesday, Feb. 18: USA 2, Sweden 1 (OT)Semifinal\nFriday, Feb. 20: USA 6, Slovakia 2Gold medal gameSunday, Feb. 22: USA 2, Canada 1 (OT)\n            \n",

For the first time in Olympic history, Team USA completed a sweep of hockey gold medals in the men's and women's events at the 2026 Milan Cortina Olympics as the men won an overtime match 2-1 over Canada on Sunday to claim the Americans' first gold medal in 46 years.The women won in nearly identical fashion with a 2-1 overtime victory against Canada on Friday to bring home their first gold medal in eight years.The United States is only the second country in history to sweep gold medals in men's and women's hockey during the same Olympic Games, joining Canada, which did so three times in 2002, 2010 and 2014.American men had not won gold since the famed \"Miracle on Ice\" team, which defeated the Soviet Union in 1980. Sunday's win came exactly 46 years to the day of that victory (Feb. 22, 1980).\nThe U.S. now has three Olympic gold medals on the men's side, having first won the hardware in 1960. Sunday's victory was its first off home ice in the Olympics. The women also have three gold medals, previously claiming the honors in 1998 and 2018.Four of the United States' six Olympic gold medals in hockey have come by defeating Canada.\nTeam USA gold medals in Olympic hockeyOlympicsTeamOpponentScore1960 Squaw ValleyMenCzechoslovakia9-41980 Lake PlacidMenSoviet Union4-31998 NaganoWomenCanada3-12018 PyeongChangWomenCanada3-22026 Milan CortinaWomenCanada2-1 (OT)2026 Milan CortinaMenCanada2-1 (OT)The Americans concluded the 2026 Olympics with 12 gold medals, the most ever for the Americans at the Winter Games, and 33 medals overall.

    "body": "\n        The 2026 Winter Olympics are now officially over as the torch has been passed from Italy to France, who will host the 2030 Winter Games across the French Alps. The Closing Ceremony, which took place in Verona and was themed \"Beauty in Action,\" showcased Italy's culture through operatic performances, an aerial ballet and numerous musical numbers.Just as the Opening Ceremony did, Italy pulled out all the stops in highlighting its many contributions to the world of art, dance and theater. Italian ballet star Roberto Bolle performed a beautiful aerial ballet that was meant to symbolize the water cycle as he was suspended in the air like a falling water droplet. He previously performed at the Winter Olympics 20 years ago to kick off the Turin Games.In between the many performances, was the parade of athletes, the passing of the Olympic torch and the awarding of the final two Olympic gold medals of the Winter Games.Here are the highlights and best moments from the 2026 Winter Olympics Closing Ceremony.\nHilary Knight & Evan Bates walk in as flag bearersFresh off a winning a gold medal for the U.S. women's hockey team, Knight was one of two flag bearers for the Americans. During the gold-medal match, Knight broke the American women's record for career goals previously held by Natalie Darwitz and Katie King. In doing so, she also broke the record for most career Olympic points in U.S. women's hockey history. It was a thrilling comeback win for the women's hockey team, which rallied from a 1-0 deficit against Canada to win 2-1 in overtime. Knight's game-tying goal in the third period kept the Americans alive to eventually win in overtime.Bates won a gold medal in the figure skating team event with the United States, as well as a silver medal in the ice dance competition with partner, and wife, Madison Chock. The duo became just the third American duo to win a silver medal in ice dance, the first since the 2010 Winter Games.\nAlysa Liu hints at future plans for skatingIce skating sensation Alysa Liu was on hand for the closing ceremony, just as joyful as she was the day she won gold in the women's singles event for the United States. Liu became the first American woman to take home gold in the singles event since 2002, jumping from third to first after a near flawless free skate program that went viral on social media.\nLiu became a national treasure as her unique journey to becoming an Olympic gold medalist spoke to so many people. Liu had been competitively skating since the age of 10, and after winning multiple national awards, she announced her retirement at 16 years old. Two years later, though, Liu returned to the sport, vowing to do it her way by picking her own schedule and adhering to a less stringent regimen that is often associated with the sport. She returned in 2024, and the following year she became a world champion. Now, she's an Olympic gold medalist and stands on top of the ice skating world.At the Closing Ceremony, Liu was asked about her plans in skating for the future, to which she was enthused about continuing in the sport.\"I have no plans to leave yet,\" Lu said when asked if she'll perform at the 2030 Winter Games. \"I can't imagine not skating next year.\"\nCross-country skiers awarded gold medalsAs per tradition, the last two gold medals were awarded at the Closing Ceremony. That distinction goes to the winners of the 50 km classic mass start cross country skiers. The honor is meant to highlight the grueling endurance that it takes to compete in the sport. Marathon runners are given the same distinction at the Summer Games.Sweden's Ebba Andersson was awarded her gold medal after beating out Norway's Heidi Weng by 2 minutes and 15 seconds in the event.On the men's side, Norway's Johannes Hoesflot Klaebo was awarded his sixth gold medal of the Milan Corina Games. With the 50 km classic mass start win, Klaebo set the record for the only winter sport athlete to win six gold medals in a single Winter Olympics. It brings Klaebo's gold medal total to 11, which means swimmer Michael Phlelps as the only other Olympian to hold more gold medals than him.\n\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Oldest Olympic volunteer honored at Closing CeremonySet to the catchy 1998 song by Italian music group Eiffel 65, Blue (Da Ba Dee), a performance was put on to honor the over 18,000 volunteers at the Winter Games. Amongst those volunteers is 88-year-old Mario Gargiulo, who was a volunteer the last time Milan Cortina hosted the Olympics back in 1956.\nTeaser for 2028 Summer Games in Los AngelesWhile the Closing Ceremony focused heavily on Italian culture, and the passing of the Olympic flag to France to host the 2030 Winter Games, we also got a nice table setter for the next Summer Olympics in 2028. Held in Los Angeles, the Closing Ceremony broadcast ended with Academy Award-nominated actress and singer Kate Hudson singing a cover of \"California Dreamin'\" by The Mamas and the Papas.As Hudson sang, a montage of various American athletes were featured in the promo video. It was the perfect video to get everyone hyped for the next Summer Games, which will surely be a spectacle in La La Land.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Officials handed out a pair of ejections after Memphis Grizzlies guard Scotty Pippen Jr. and Miami Heat forward Myron Gardner engaged in an altercation during the Heat's 136-120 win on Saturday. Pippen and Gardner watched the final 1:55 from the locker rooms as a result of their scuffle, which spilled into the courtside seats on one corner of the floor.An unnecessary hit on one end of the floor led to the skirmish on the other. Pippen drained a 3-pointer from the top of the arc to cut the Grizzlies' deficit to 134-113 with two minutes to play, and well after he released the ball, Gardner stepped in from well out of the play and made contact with Pippen's backside, sending him to the floor. There was no foul call.Pippen ran down the floor and clearly sought out Gardner in the left corner. He extended both arms in a targeted shove of Gardner, and the two tangled up and pulled each other to the ground. Officials, players and coaches sprinted to the scene to attempt to break up the fight. No other players engaged in fighting.\n\"I thought it was kind of a cheap shot,\" Pippen said of the play that sparked the fight. \"He kind of hit me when I didn't see him, so I thought it was a soft move. I just thought he maybe needed a hug at the other end, and that's kind of what happened.\"Pippen and Gardner could face discipline from the NBA, although the former downplayed the kerfuffle and said he does not expect the league to step in with punishment beyond the ejections.\n\"I don't think any punches or anything was thrown,\" Pippen said. \"I think it was just a hug. I don't think it was too crazy. I got ejected. I think that should be left at that, but we'll see.\"Heat coach Erik Spoelstra came to Gardner's defense after his involvement in the brouhaha and said that he loves Myron \"regardless\" of what occurred between him and Pippen.\"Let's exhale,\" Spoelstra said postgame. \"We'll take a look at it. His greatest strength is his unbridled intensity and effort and energy. His heart is in a great place. He's wired like us, competitively. You add that type of intensity to this competitive will that will boil over at times. I don't want to take away from that competitiveness.\"\nPippen finished the contest with 18 points in 21 minutes off the bench for a Memphis team that is spiraling further toward the bottom of the Western Conference with five losses in its last six games and 11 in its last 14. Gardner played six minutes across two stints on the floor for the Southeast Division-leading Heat.\n            ",

Teammate Luis Suarez grabs his arm in an effort to pull him away, the pair emerging from that doorway moments later in Suarez's attempt to de-escalate the situation. It was initially unclear how close Messi got to the officials' locker room but in a statement from PRO, which is responsible for all refereeing assignments in MLS and other U.S. professional soccer leagues, they said the World Cup winner did not get far enough to put himself in danger of breaking league rules.\n\n\"After speaking with the match officials, we can confirm Lionel Messi did not enter the officials' locker room,\" PRO said in a statement on Sunday.No match officials filed complaints against Messi after the match and an investigation concluded that he did not enter any restricted areas during the incident.\nMLS previously fined FC Cincinnati's Matt Miazga for three matches after he entered the referees' locker room following a playoff match at the New York Red Bulls, angered by the yellow card he received that would keep him out of the next game in the postseason. Miazga's suspension was subsequently reduced to two matches.\n            \n",

    "body": "\n        The WNBA and the Women's National Basketball Players Association recently agreed to a 40-day extension of the current collective bargaining agreement, pushing the deadline to get a new CBA done to Jan. 9, 2026. Upon agreeing to the extension, the WNBPA released a statement saying, \"We expect substantive movement from the league within this window.\"Sure enough, it didn't take long to learn that the league had delivered a new offer with improved salaries: max contracts with a $1 million base salary (open to multiple players on the same team), an average salary above $500,000 and a minimum salary above $225,000, a source with knowledge of the situation told CBS Sports. Furthermore, the offer would raise the salary cap from $1.5 million to $5 million, and further growth would be tied to revenue growth, though the specific machinations for that are unclear. \n        \n            \n                WNBA CBA proposal would push max player salary to $1 million, raise cap to $5 million\n                \n                    Isabel Gonzalez                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThose pay raises -- the current regular max contract is $214,466 and the current veteran minimum is $78,831 -- would not come without a cost. According to Annie Costabile of Front Office Sports, the league has also proposed lengthening the season and eliminating player housing subsidies. A source with knowledege of the situation confirmed to CBS Sports that the league's proposal would eliminate housing benefits, but indicated that any discussion regarding training camps potentially starting earlier than April 1 is merely an opportunity to explore the potential footprint of the season and ways to further generate revenue.\nIf implemented, such changes would radically alter how the WNBA operates and would have potentially severe effects for rookies and players on short-term contracts, as well as the WNBA's relationship with the NCAA, FIBA and other leagues. Changes to the schedule could be catastrophic on multiple frontsLet's first examine the potential schedule changes first reported by FOS and confirmed by CBS Sports:The league has also proposed lengthening the season, including an earlier start date that is expected to interfere with the NCAA tournament and potentially other leagues like Project B. The start date for training camp could be as early as mid-March, sources indicated. Historically, training camps have begun in late April, following the conclusion of the NCAA season and the draft, though the league is allowed to begin them as early as April 1 under the current CBA. Moving the start of training camp to mid-March -- just as the NCAA Tournament is getting underway -- would raise a series of questions:1. What happens with the draft?Moving the start of training camp to mid-March leaves no good option for the draft. \nHistorically, the draft has taken place in mid-April, following the conclusion of the Final Four. A mid-March start for training camp suggests an early-to-mid April start for the season, and it wouldn't make sense to hold the draft after the season has already started. On the other hand, moving the draft to early March, before the NCAA season has come to a close, would force teams and players into early decisions they may not be entirely comfortable with. While conference tournaments and the NCAA Tournament are not the be-all and end-all of scouting, they provide valuable insight into how players perform under pressure.2. What are rookies supposed to do?Regardless of when the draft takes place in this hypothetical new schedule, rookies would be left in the lurch. \nMoving the draft to early March would create a scenario where players are drafted while still playing for their college teams. Leaving the draft in mid-April may mean players are drafted after the WNBA season has already started. If the draft gets moved up, would players feel pressure to leave school early so they could participate in training camp? Would that even be allowed? The nature of the NCAA Tournament means that some rookies will be done with their collegiate seasons weeks before other rookies, which could create a significant advantage for certain rookies and teams. If players opt to finish their collegiate season, they could be thrown into the WNBA season without a training camp.It's already extremely difficult for rookies drafted outside of the first round to make a roster. These potential changes could make it nearly impossible. Unless roster sizes were increased, there would be no incentive for teams to hold open roster spots for second- and third-round picks during training camp or the beginning of the season. And outside of their college tape, there would be no way for players who don't participate in training camp to prove they deserve a spot. 3. An attempt to derail other leagues?\nIt seems obvious that a primary reason the WNBA is raising the possibility of starting training camp in mid-March is to disrupt other leagues, including Unrivaled, Athletes Unlimited and, in particular, the newly announced Project B. An earlier start would also impact players who play in European, Asian and Australian leagues. Unrivaled, which was co-founded by Breanna Stewart and Napheesa Collier, will employ 54 WNBA players this season and is set to run from Jan. 5 through March 4. Athletes Unlimited has 33 players listed on its roster page, though not all of them are current WNBA players. Their month-long season will run from Feb. 1 through March 1. Project B is not slated to start until the fall of 2026, but it appears to be the biggest potential competitor to the WNBA and has already signed a number of stars to seven-figure contracts, including Nneka Ogwumike, Alyssa Thomas and Jonquel Jones. The league, which has significant financial backing, would play from November until April in cities across Asia and Europe. \"It's very clear that the league wants to push away all other leagues,\" Seattle Storm star Gabby Williams said over All-Star Weekend. \"It would make sense if they were paying us more here, but it still isn't the case, even with the new proposals. And it's very clear now that they wanna push Unrivaled out, push AU out.\"\nThe league's prioritization clause, which was introduced in the most recent CBA and requires (with some exceptions) players to be in market for the start of training camp, has been a sore spot, particularly for international players. For now, the WNBA remains signed on to FIBA's \"letter of clearance\" system, which allows players to participate in multiple leagues.As salaries rise, it's reasonable for the league and owners to want to protect their investment. If teams are now paying some players over $1 million, it makes sense that they don't want them playing year-round or potentially getting hurt in another league. Stars -- many of whom can also make real money off the court -- might be fine with that reality, but what about players making the minimum or fighting to stay in the league? A player earning the new minimum of $225K who is potentially no longer able to play in other leagues may actually be taking a pay cut overall. And that's before taking into account the potential loss of housing benefits. \nHousing benefits on the chopping block?Here's FOS on that front:Under the current CBA, players have multiple options during the regular season and the playoffs for housing. Players can either stay in housing provided by the team or receive a monthly stipend, which varies by city; players with children under the age of 13 receive a two-bedroom unit. The monthly stipend for players who opt not to live in team-provided housing ranges between $1,177 in Las Vegas to $2,647 in New York. If housing benefits are eliminated, players could lose roughly $8-18K, depending on where they play and whether their team makes the playoffs. That's a sizeable loss, particularly for players in expensive markets such as New York, Golden State, Chicago and Toronto. The housing benefits also set up a conflict between stars and players fighting to stay in the league. For players in line to make the max, especially those with substantial off-court income, giving up the housing stipend for a higher salary is an excellent deal. A player such as Breanna Stewart could go from making $220K in 2025 to north of $1 million in 2026 under this latest offer. What's roughly $18K in that scenario? About 0.02% of her new salary. For someone like Stewart's Liberty teammate Kennedy Burke, who was on the veteran minimum and doesn't have major endorsements, it's a substantial chunk of change. Her salary would potentially rise from $78,831 to north of $225K with this latest offer, but she would lose about $18K in the process, or 8% of her new salary. Players on short-term deals would also be major losers if the housing benefits disappear. Due to small roster sizes, teams are routinely bringing in players on hardship contracts for weeks at a time. If team housing is no longer available, will they have to stay in hotels for the duration of that period? And pay out of their own pocket? It's worth noting that without having access to the full proposal, it's possible that exceptions to the housing benefits are outlined for players on short-term deals. \nSimply a negotiating tactic?The WNBA's proposal is a logistical nightmare, not only for other leagues, but for itself. It would devalue the draft, derail rookie development and potentially encourage players to ply their trade elsewhere. It's hard to imagine any scenario in which the players would accept these terms.It makes you wonder, then, if these proposals are simply a negotiating tactic from the WNBA. If the players push back, as they likely will, the WNBA can then try to extract a concession from them in order to maintain the current schedule and/or housing benefits. Whatever the case may be, this episode is another reminder that the league's willingness to raise salaries is not enough to get a deal done. There's still a long way to go before the two sides agree to a new CBA. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The penultimate edition of the College Football Playoff Rankings was released Tuesday night with undefeated Ohio State maintaining its grip on the No. 1 spot ahead of Indiana for the fourth straight week as a new team moved into the top four, set to receive a bye through the first round of the bracket. It was a Lone Star State fiasco during Rivalry Week as Texas A&M fell on the road to Texas, vaulting Texas Tech into the No. 4 spot behind Georgia, which moved up one spot, with conference championship games still to play.  The Red Raiders, which have never participated in the playoff, are in the midst of a tremendous 11-1 season under fourth-year coach Joey McGuire. Their 29-7 win over BYU stands as the feather in their cap with the Big 12 Championship Game ahead.  Meanwhile, the reigning national champion Buckeyes are seeking their seventh playoff appearance in 12 years of the postseason bracket's existence (2014, 2016, 2019-20, 2022, 2024). Ohio State will match up with Indiana in the Big Ten Championship Game seeking to go wire-to-wire in the No. 1 spot.  The Buckeyes toppled rival Michigan, 27-9, on Saturday for their first win in The Game since 2019. The Hoosiers demolished Purdue, 56-3, to set up one of the most anticipated clashes in the sport this season.  \nThe Bulldogs is set to play Alabama in the SEC Championship Game with it appearing as if the Crimson Tide have locked up an at-large bid given they moved in front of Notre Dame for the No. 9 spot.  Miami (FL), despite being ranked No. 12, takes the 11th projected bid from the CFP Selection Committee as the highest-rated team from the ACC. However, it will be Virginia squaring off with Duke in the ACC Championship Game, which will award the league's automatic bid as the fourth-highest rated conference title winner. The Hurricanes will have a chance to earn a bid as an at-large team.  Tulane claims the last of the 12 committee-projected playoff spots as the highest-ranked Group of Five team in Tuesday's release at No. 20. However, the Green Wave will face North Texas in the American Championship game with the winner earning a bid given the 12-team playoff model grants automatic entry to the five highest-ranked conference champions.  \nJames Madison is ranked for the first time this week at No. 25. JMU could earn a second Group of Five bid if it wins the Sun Belt and Duke beats UVA in the ACC title game.        College Football Playoff Rankings, Dec. 2  * First-round bye | ~ First-round host | ^ Highest-ranked Group of Five team  Ohio State (12-0) *Indiana (12-0) *Georgia (11-1) *Texas Tech (11-1) *Oregon (11-1) ~Ole Miss (11-1) ~Texas A&M (11-1) ~Oklahoma (10-2) ~Alabama (10-2)Notre Dame (10-2)BYU (11-1)Miami (FL) (10-2)Texas (9-3)Vanderbilt (10-2)Utah (10-2)USC (9-3)Virginia (10-2)Arizona (9-3)Michigan (9-3)Tulane (10-2) ^Houston (9-3)Georgia Tech (9-3)Iowa (8-4)North Texas (11-1)James Madison (11-1)Ole Miss secures home game despite Lane Kiffin's exitAt No. 6 in the updated rankings, the Rebels (11-1) are locked into a first-round home game following Kiffin's departure to LSU. Committee chair Hunter Yurachek previously stated that Kiffin leaving the school for another job would create a new \"data point\" for the committee, but Ole Miss' overall grade was not diminished as a result. Several members of the coaching staff are staying through the postseason, including offensive assistant Charlie Weis Jr., who will call plays in Kiffin's absence. Weis followed Kiffin to Baton Rouge on Sunday but has returned to Ole Miss temporarily to help quarterback Trinidad Chambliss and this offense see it through in the playoff. CBS Sports reported over the weekend the promotion of Pete Golding to head coach was due in part to keep much of what remained of the Rebels' coaching staff intact ahead of the penultimate playoff rankings reveal. Keeping Ole Miss in a first-round home game designation will reportedly generate more than $60 million for Oxford, Mississippi. Kiffin said Sunday he requested to remain with the Rebels through the playoff, but athletic director Keith Carter refused. If the current seeding stands, Ole Miss will host the No. 11 seed -- perhaps the ACC champion -- on Dec. 19 or 20 in the opening round.\nACC vs. Group of FiveNo. 17 Virginia can make it easy on the committee this weekend with a win over Duke in the ACC Championship Game, but a doomsday scenario is on the table for the conference if the Blue Devils upset the Cavaliers. That could bring 25th-ranked James Madison -- the projected champion of the Sun Belt -- into the conversation. If the Dukes beat Troy for a conference title, they could get the 12-seed in Sunday's final bracket with the winner of Tulane-North Texas in the American garnering the No. 11 designation. No. 20 Tulane remains the committee's highest-ranked Group of Five team for the second consecutive week. Looking closer at the metrics, there's a possibility that Duke's strength-of-schedule edge over JMU could potentially put the Blue Devils -- with five losses -- in the playoff if they're ranked higher than the 12-win Dukes on Sunday afternoon should both teams win this weekend. Duke was not ranked in Tuesday's poll.\n        \n            \n                College Football Playoff Rankings reaction: Why James Madison at No. 25 could spell disaster for the ACC\n                \n                    Shehan Jeyarajah                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nCommittee avoids SEC distrust  Alabama's push ahead from No. 10 to No. 9 Tuesday night ahead of Notre Dame means the Crimson Tide (10-2) are safe, independent of Saturday afternoon's result in the SEC Championship Game against third-ranked Georgia. Now, the committee will not have to answer any questions concerning the idea of a three-loss SEC title game loser being left out of the bracket after this decision. If Alabama wins, we're projecting the Crimson Tide to move into first-round bye status with Georgia hosting in the first round. Previously unbeaten Texas A&M sliding to No. 7 was expected after its loss to Texas. The Aggies' lone ranked win this season against a team currently slotted inside the committee's top 25 came at Notre Dame on Sept. 13.\nBYU's simple missionAt No. 11 behind Notre Dame and ahead of Miami, the Cougars are in with a win over Texas Tech in the Big 12 Championship Game. It appears that's the only direct path for two representatives from the conference. Cougars coach Kalani Sitake will be able to maintain his focus on getting this team to the playoff the rest of the week following an extension -- thanks to Crumbl's CEO and other boosters stepping up to keep him -- in wake of his flirtation with Penn State. Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark suggested a blind resume grading system Tuesday afternoon ahead of the reveal, effectively backing BYU's at-large stance in case the Cougars fall in their finale. The committee has spoken, however, and that's not going to matter if Texas Tech beats BYU for a second time. \"Let's not look at logos. Let's look at résumés,\" Yormark said. \"Any blind résumé comparison has BYU in the top 10. No question about it. In comparison with Notre Dame as an example, BYU has a better overall record, better strength of record and better strength of schedule. I am confident that the CFP will get it right for BYU.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Toronto Blue Jays have reached an agreement with free-agent starter Cody Ponce on a three-year pact worth $30 million, according to MLB.com's Mark Feinsand. Ponce is the second starter the Blue Jays have added in the past week. They also officially announced their seven-year deal with Dylan Cease, a $210 million pact that's the largest free-agent contract ever handed out by the Toronto franchise. Ponce, 31, has not pitched at the MLB level since 2021. He spent last season with the Hanwha Eagles of the Korea Baseball Organization, starting 29 times and amassing a 1.89 ERA and a 6.15 strikeout-to-walk ratio. CBS Sports ranked Ponce as the 45th-best player on the market. Here's what we wrote at the time:Ponce, 32 come April, will return stateside after spending a few years overseas, first in Japan and then in South Korea. He'll look nothing like he did during his first 20 career MLB appearances. These days, he's capable of touching into the upper-90s with his heater and throws, among other secondaries, a quality splitter. There are enough KBO-to-MLB pitching success stories -- ranging from someone with staying power, in Merrill Kelly, to more fleeting cases, like Erick Fedde and Chris Flexen -- to envision a team giving Ponce a rotation spot on a multi-year pact to demonstrate where he lands on that spectrum.Here's more to know about the Ponce signing.The Blue Jays have a rotation surplusIn addition to Cease and Ponce, the Blue Jays had Shane Bieber remain in his contract rather than execute an opt-out clause and enter free agency. Factor in Kevin Gausman, star rookie Trey Yesavage, and José Berríos, and Toronto has the luxury of having more capable starters than rotation slots. And that's without mentioning Bowden Francis, who has started nearly 30 times the past two years, or Eric Lauer, who had a 3.18 ERA in 104 innings in 2025.PitcherIPERASO/BBKevin Gausman1933.593.78Trey Yesavage (MLB)143.212.29Shane Bieber40.13.575.29José Berríos1664.172.46Dylan Cease1684.553.03Cody Ponce (KBO)180.21.896.15Of course, that's a good problem to have at this or any point in time because it gives the Blue Jays options and contingency plans. They can entertain trading from that group, and they can toy with shifting a couple members to the bullpen. They can also enter camp knowing that if and when an injury happens -- and pitchers are known for getting hurt on occasion -- they have internal backups already in place.\nKeep in mind, the Blue Jays didn't have that luxury entering last year, when they had to rush to sign Spencer Turnbull and José Ureña to serve as stopgaps on an injury-ravaged staff.Bullpen, shortstop remain questions for AL champsWhat else do the defending American League champions need to do this winter? A few things.Foremost, the Blue Jays have been linked to most of the high-leverage relievers of note, including right-hander Pete Fairbanks. It stands to reason they'll attempt to add quality instead of quantity to their relief corps. That's because Toronto is starting to run into a numbers game with its pitching staff. With Ponce included, the Blue Jays now have nine pitchers who cannot be optioned to the minors. If Yesavage is part of the Opening Day rotation -- and you would assume he is -- then Toronto really has only three \"flex\" spots, depending on how they proceed with the rest of the winter. \nElsewhere, the Blue Jays have to figure out if they're going to retain free agent Bo Bichette, turn to an internal replacement, or try to land a new shortstop from outside the organization. Bichette, considered one of the best free agents available, hasn't yet generated much rumor mill buzz ahead of the start of next week's Winter Meetings. Should the Blue Jays stay in house, the path of least resistance would have them slide Andrés Giménez to short and install Ernie Clement at second base. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The most significant ranking in the penultimate College Football Playoff Rankings had nothing to do with Miami or Texas. Instead, the playoff committee showed their hand. With the final spot in the rankings, the CFP Committee ranked James Madison at No. 25 in the country. The Dukes are 11-1 and face Troy in the Sun Belt Championship Game on Friday. By winning, James Madison can all but assure itself a spot in the final rankings for the first time in program history. But if JMU accomplishes the feat and finishes as a ranked conference champion, it could set off a nightmare scenario for the ACC that would leave them out of the playoff entirely. For clarity, let's go back to the protocol. The top five conference champions are guaranteed auto bids in the College Football Playoff field. It's very specifically the top five conference champions; the Power Four conferences are not implicitly guaranteed a spot. Technically, all five spots could be taken by Group of Six champions, if they were earned in the rankings. \nWhen the CFP bracket is mocked, No. 12 Miami plays the role of the fourth conference champion auto-bid. There's just one problem: The Hurricanes -- the best team in the ACC -- aren't eligible for the auto-bid. In fact, thanks to a bloated conference and convoluted set of tiebreakers, unranked Duke plays No. 17 Virginia for the ACC crown. And in Duke, the ACC has its perfect, disastrous storm. The Blue Devils had a lackluster season, limping out to a 7-5 record. Three of those losses came in nonconference play, with horrendous performances against Illinois, Tulane and UConn. But when it comes to conference contention, none of those games matter. Duke's only losses came against Georgia Tech and Virginia. And therefore, Duke is now in the ACC Championship Game as one of the weakest conference finalists in years. As only 3.5-point underdogs, the Blue Devils have a serious chance of pulling the upset. But with five losses, Duke would be all but guaranteed to finish behind both the American Conference champion and Sun Belt champ James Madison, despite winning a power conference championship. \nIf James Madison was unranked, it would be easy for the committee to sit back and say that they consider the Blue Devils and Dukes as comparable teams. A win over No. 17 Virginia would supersede any on JMU's schedule. But by ranking James Madison, the committee has shown their hand. James Madison is a top 25 team in the eyes of the committee. Duke is not. And furthermore, based on their resume, the Blue Devils aren't anywhere close. If Duke wins the ACC, the conference could become the first power league to ever miss the 12-team College Football Playoff. At the Group of Six level, conferences are much more sensitive about tiebreaker rules setting up their teams for failure. Some work around it with blatant playoff-driven advantages. The primary tiebreaker in the American Conference is simply CFP Rankings. Even though No. 24 North Texas has a better record, No. 20 Tulane is hosting the title game for the express purpose of giving them an easier path to the playoff. Not so in the ACC. \nSMU was painfully close to helping the league avoid this fate. The Mustangs led California late in the fourth quarter on Saturday night. A win would have elevated SMU and Virginia as 7-1 teams. Instead, the Mustangs' loss pushed them into a five-way tie for second. And coming out of the tiebreaker -- combined conference opponent record -- was perhaps the weakest team in the group. Virginia is favored to win the ACC Championship Game on Saturday. If the Cavaliers do, they'll easily slot into the CFP with the No. 11 seed. Their chances wouldn't be great in a road game against No. 6 Ole Miss, but at least the ACC would send a champion to the postseason. But thanks to James Madison's No. 25 ranking, the ACC is officially on the hot seat. A Duke conference championship would spell disaster for the league, and end with two Group of Six teams in the field for the first time ever. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        There was a major change in the latest set of College Football Playoff Rankings, as Texas A&M dropped out of the top four to No. 7 following its loss to Texas in the final full weekend of the regular season. The Aggies' drop allowed Texas Tech to climb into the top four at No. 4. Georgia also climbed one spot to No. 3 while Ohio State and Indiana remain No. 1 and No. 2, respectively. That wasn't the only notable development in Tuesday's rankings, though. Notre Dame slipped one spot to No. 10 after sitting at nine for several weeks. Alabama leapfrogged the Fighting Irish after closing its season with a narrow 27-20 victory against in-state rival Auburn. The Crimson Tide can cement their status in Saturday's SEC Championship Game clash against Georgia, while Notre Dame -- as an independent -- left its last impression on the selection committee in Week 14. It looks like Ole Miss will be unaffected by coach Lane Kiffin's departure for LSU. The Rebels still rank sixth, which gives them homefield advantage on the projected College Football Playoff bracket. Retaining most of the remaining coaching staff through the postseason at least likely helped Ole Miss' outlook. \nTulane remained as the highest-ranked Group of Five school at No. 20, which would give the Green Wave the No. 12 seed in the projected bracket. Virginia would sit at the 11-seed if it's able to take care of business against Duke in the ACC Championship Game. \n                                                                    CBS Sports design\n                                                            Keep an eye on James Madison James Madison made its College Football Playoff Rankings debut after capping an 11-1 regular season with a 59-10 win against Coastal Carolina. The Dukes, who went undefeated in conference play, will face off against Troy in the Sun Belt Conference Championship Game Friday. That's a potentially huge spot for the Dukes. They'll need some help, but the path to the playoff is there. If Virginia loses in the ACC Championship Game, that would seemingly open one of the five automatic bids. It's hard to imagine a five-loss Duke team vaulting over the likes of James Madison. \nSo there's a scenario where two Group of Five teams make the College Football Playoff. The assumption is that the winner of the American Conference -- either No. 20 Tulane or No. 24 North Texas -- will get an automatic bid no matter what happens. \n        \n            \n                College Football Playoff Rankings reaction: Why James Madison at No. 25 could spell disaster for the ACC\n                \n                    Shehan Jeyarajah                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nNotre Dame on the ropes? Though Notre Dame fell just one spot to No. 10, that's a very significant development. It means the Fighting Irish are now the last team to make the field with an at-large bid. That's bubble territory. Since Notre Dame doesn't play in a conference title game this week, it technically cannot control its own fate anymore. The Fighting Irish are likely cheering for No. 4 Texas Tech in the Big 12 Championship Game. If No. 11 BYU wins the Big 12 title, there's a strong chance that it supplants Notre Dame as a champion while Texas Tech falls to an at-large spot -- leaving no room for the Fighting Irish. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        It looks like the Oregon Ducks will see both of their coordinators leave for head-coaching jobs at the end of their College Football Playoff run, as Tosh Lupoi is on the verge of returning to his alma mater to be the next coach at Cal, sources told CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz and Chris Hummer. Lupoi, the defensive coordinator for Dan Lanning ever since he took over at Oregon in 2022, has emerged as the top target of Cal's search after the school fired Justin Wilcox. Lupoi, 44, played defensive line at Cal from 2000-05 and began his coaching career as Cal's defensive line coach from 2008-11. From there, he worked as a defensive assistant at Washington and Alabama before stints as the defensive line coach for three NFL teams -- the Cleveland Browns, Atlanta Falcons and Jacksonville Jaguars. At Alabama, Lupoi worked his way up from an analyst in 2014 to defensive coordinator in 2018 under Nick Saban, earning a reputation as a strong recruiter. His defense at Oregon has been among the best in the country, finishing the 2025 regular season eighth nationally in scoring defense at 14.8 points per game allowed. Should the deal be finalized, Lupoi will head back down the coast to Berkeley to take over a Cal team that finished 7-5 this season, but general manager Ron Rivera fired Wilcox after nine seasons at the helm following an embarrassing 31-10 rivalry loss to Stanford on Nov. 23. Wilcox had a 48-55 overall record at Cal, including a combined 12-12 (5-10 ACC) mark in two seasons since the program transitioned from the Pac-12 to the ACC. \n\n        \n            \n                Kentucky hires Will Stein: Wildcats tab Oregon offensive coordinator after firing Mark Stoops\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe first order of business for Lupoi will be attempting to keep star freshman quarterback Jaron-Keawe Sagapolutele from entering the transfer portal. Sagapolutele completed 63.6% of his passes for 3,116 yards, 17 touchdowns and nine interceptions as a true freshman starter, at times putting a tantalizing display of talent on the field that points to an extremely bright future. If Lupoi can keep Sagapolutele as a Golden Bear, he'll have a great chance to hit the ground running with a team that can compete in the ACC. Cal will expect Lupoi to be able to improve their defense that finished the season 76th in the country in scoring defense, allowing 26.5 points per game. \nLanning now faces the challenge many top programs do after finding consistent success, as he has to replace both of his coordinators. Along with Lupoi's looming departure to Cal, offensive coordinator Will Stein is returning to his home state of Kentucky to coach the Wildcats, and Lanning will have to identify two new coordinators to take over for the Ducks in 2026. \n            ",

    "body": "\nWith nearly two months of the 2025-26 NHL season complete, the Boston Bruins are near the top of the Atlantic Division and in the middle of the pack in the overall league standings. But they can brag about one achievement no other team has accomplished -- they are the only club that has defeated the Colorado Avalanche in regulation this campaign.Boston registered a 3-2 home victory on Oct. 25, ending Colorado's season-opening eight-game point streak (5-0-3). Since then, the Avalanche have earned points in 16 consecutive contests (13-0-3), including both of their outings during last week's abbreviated four-day span as they lost to the Minnesota Wild in a shootout before clobbering the Montreal Canadiens 7-2 on Saturday.Four teams won both of their games last week, while four others joined Colorado with a victory and a post-regulation defeat. A total of six clubs failed to get in the win column, but the Utah Mammoth had the toughest time as they began a six-game road trip with three regulation losses.Each week during the season, I'll rank the league's top 10 teams based on both the previous week's performances and overall body of work in 2025-26. I'll also give brief synopsis for each club that explains why they're ranked where they are.Let's dive into the power ratings after Week 8 of the 2025-26 NHL season and highlight a few of the teams' notable accomplishments.NHL Week 9 power ratings 1. Colorado Avalanche (1-0-1 in Week 8; 18-1-6 overall)The Avalanche gave up two goals in each of their two contests last week, extending their streak of allowing fewer than three tallies to five games. They scored nine times in those two outings, increasing their NHL-leading total to 103 goals as they've produced at least four in eight of their last 11 contests. Nathan MacKinnon posted a pair of multi-point performances, recording a goal and an assist against Minnesota before netting one tally and setting up two others versus Montreal. The 2024 Hart Trophy winner, who has been kept off the scoresheet in only four of Colorado's 25 games, leads the league in both goals (20) and points (44). Captain Gabriel Landeskog, who missed the last three regular seasons due to a knee injury, collected three points in the win over the Canadiens and has notched five over his last three contests after amassing just seven in his first 22 outings in 2025-26.2. Dallas Stars (2-0-0; 17-5-4)Dallas was one of the four teams that won both of their games in Week 8, extending its winning streak to four and point streak to six (5-0-1). Wyatt Johnston has been on fire of late, registering five points last week and nine over his last four contests. The 22-year-old center scored the game-winning goal against the Mammoth last Friday before recording his fourth career hat trick and also adding an assist in the Stars' 6-1 triumph over the Ottawa Senators two days later. It was the second four-point effort in four games for Johnston, who recorded just one point over his previous six outings. Captain Jamie Benn scored in both games last week and is riding a four-game point streak while Roope Hintz had his four-game goal-scoring run ended by Ottawa but notched a pair of assists to extend his point run to five contests. Jason Robertson, who had two goals and two assists last week, has netted at least one tally in nine of his last 10 games and recorded a point in 13 of his past 15. Mikko Rantanen also was productive in Week 8, amassing five assists in Dallas' two contests.3. Tampa Bay Lightning (2-0-0; 16-7-2)The Lightning extended their overall winning streak to seven games and their road run to five with victories over the Detroit Red Wings and New York Rangers last week. They scored a total of 10 goals in those two triumphs and have tallied at least four times on five occasions during their seven-game winning streak. Tampa Bay also has allowed fewer than two goals in five of those contests. Brandon Hagel enters Week 9 with a five-game goal-scoring streak and posted his third two-tally performance during that run in the triumph against the Rangers. Defenseman Darren Raddysh came up with a pair of three-point efforts in Week 8 and has landed on the scoresheet in seven of his last eight outings. The 29-year-old is on pace to shatter the career high of 37 points he registered in 73 games last season as he has amassed 16 in 19 contests this campaign. Nikita Kucherov is riding a nine-game point streak during which he has racked up four goals and 14 assists after setting up five tallies in Week 8.4. Carolina Hurricanes (2-0-0; 16-7-2)The Hurricanes are the third straight team in this week's ratings that won both of its games in Week 8 as they cruised past the Winnipeg Jets 5-1 before edging the Calgary Flames 1-0 in overtime. Seth Jarvis was the offensive star against Winnipeg as he registered his second career hat trick to increase his club-leading season total to 15 goals. Meanwhile, Nikolaj Ehlers, who is set to appear in his 700th NHL game Thursday against the Toronto Maple Leafs, ended his six-game drought by scoring the lone goal in the triumph over Calgary. Defenseman Shayne Gostisbehere and Andrei Svechnikov came up with multi-point efforts against the Jets as both recorded a pair of assists.5. Minnesota Wild (1-0-1; 14-7-5)Minnesota went to a shootout in both of its games last week, defeating Colorado on Friday before losing to the Buffalo Sabres a day later. The Wild, whose point streak has reached 11 games (9-0-2), scored a total of four regulation goals in those contests -- with Kirill Kaprizov producing three of them. The 28-year-old Russian left wing enters Week 9 with a five-game goal-scoring streak and tallies in eight of his last 11 outings. Kaprizov has gone without a goal in back-to-back games just once since Oct. 28 as he has converted in 11 of his past 16. Matt Boldy netted Minnesota's other tally last week, scoring against the Sabres after recording the decisive shootout goal in the victory over the Avalanche. Since enduring a six-game drought from Oct. 25-Nov. 4, the 24-year-old has scored in eight of his last 12 contests. Veteran Norwegian right wing Mats Zuccarello notched an assist in each of the Wild's games last week, giving him at least one point in six of his last eight outings.6. Washington Capitals (2-0-0; 15-9-2)The fourth and final team to go 2-0-0 last week was the Capitals, who defeated Toronto 4-2 and the New York Islanders 4-1 to extend their overall winning streak to four games. Tom Wilson joined Connor McMichael with a goal and an assist against the Maple Leafs before netting two tallies and setting up another versus the Islanders. The 31-year-old right wing has notched at least one point in five consecutive contests and seven of his last eight. Wilson is six goals shy of 200 for his career and needs one to tie Bengt Gustafsson for seventh place on Washington's all-time list. Nine-time Maurice Richard Trophy winner Alex Ovechkin, who is first in NHL history with 909 tallies and counting, has notched at least one point in 11 of his last 14 games while defenseman Jakob Chychrun was kept off the scoresheet by the Isles after registering a five-game goal-scoring streak and a 10-game point run during which he collected seven tallies and six assists.7. Anaheim Ducks (2-1-0; 16-9-1)The Ducks played three games last week and won two of them, edging the Los Angeles Kings in a shootout and bouncing back from a loss to the Chicago Blackhawks with a 4-1 triumph over the St. Louis Blues. Chris Kreider scored in each of Anaheim's three contests following a 10-game stretch during which he tallied just once. Leo Carlsson recorded two goals and four assists in Week 8 to extend his point streak to seven games. A 20-year-old Swedish center who was the second overall pick in the 2023 NHL Draft, Carlsson has amassed three tallies and seven assists during his run and is tied for fourth in the league with 36 points. Troy Terry had his seven-game point streak halted in Monday's win at St. Louis, but 19-year-old right wing Beckett Sennecke extended his to eight contests with an assist. In doing so, he tied Paul Kariya for the longest run by a rookie in franchise history and became the second-fastest Duck to reach 20 points, accomplishing the feat in 26 games. Kariya owns the club mark as he notched 20 points in 24 contests in 1994-95. Meanwhile, Mason McTavish collected a goal and three assists last week, giving him at least one point in six of his last seven outings.8. Los Angeles Kings (1-0-1; 12-6-7)Los Angeles has earned at least one point in nine of its last 10 games after going 1-0-1 in Week 8 with a shootout loss at Anaheim and a 2-1 overtime triumph over the Vancouver Canucks. The Kings are hoping Adrian Kempe is about to break out of a lengthy slump as his OT winner against Vancouver was just his third goal in his last 16 contests. The 29-year-old Swedish right wing also notched his first assist in seven games in that triumph, while Brian Dumoulin continued his uncharacteristic offensive surge by setting up a tally. The 34-year-old defenseman also notched a pair of assists in the shootout loss to the Ducks and has registered four points in as many contests after picking up only two in his first 21 outings this season.9. New Jersey Devils (1-2-0; 16-9-1)New Jersey dropped 5-3 decisions to the Philadelphia Flyers and Columbus Blue Jackets to end last week at 1-2-0 and fall to 4-5-0 since star forward Jack Hughes suffered a finger injury in an off-ice incident that is likely to keep him sidelined for eight weeks. Captain Nico Hischier and Timo Meier both enter Week 9 having scored a goal in five of the contests during their six-game point streaks. The first overall pick in the 2017 NHL Draft, Hischier has registered six tallies and six assists on his run, while Meier has collected five and three, respectively.10. Vegas Golden Knights (1-1-0; 11-6-8)Vegas began last week with its fourth straight setback (0-2-2), a 4-1 loss to the Canadiens on Friday, but ended the slide the following day with a 4-3 triumph over the San Jose Sharks. Captain Mark Stone scored the lone goal against Montreal and notched an assist versus San Jose, giving him at least one point in each of the nine games in which he has played this campaign. Tomas Hertl tallied twice in the victory against the Sharks to increase his season total to 11 goals and pull even with Jack Eichel and Pavel Dorofeyev for the team lead. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        \r\nThe week after Thanksgiving can be a bit of a slog both in real life and in sports. I get it. But the ACC/SEC challenge's arrival on Tuesday brings with it some good cheer and some great action to help rally the spirits. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe event will take place over two days and features 16 games across the country -- starting with a loaded nine-game slate (!!) on Tuesday and concluding Wednesday with seven more games.\r\n\r\n\n        \n            \n                Ranking college basketball's best freshmen: Duke's Cameron Boozer earns Freshman of the Week honors again\n                \n                    Cameron Salerno                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\r\nThe first day of the challenge features four games in the 7 p.m. ET tipoff slot led by No. 13 Tennessee at Syracuse and Texas A&M at Pittsburgh. The night gets better as it goes along and features No. 15 Florida visiting No. 4 Duke before eventually getting us to the nightcap at Rupp Arena, where No. 16 North Carolina visits No. 18 Kentucky.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat's a mouthful! That means there's a ton of action on deck. So I've sounded the horn and rallied the troops to prepare accordingly with picks for every game straight up and against the spread below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tOdds via DraftKings Sportsbook | All times ET\r\n\n\r\n       Missouri at Notre Dame            \r\n\n\r\n\t9 p.m. on ESPNU, fuboTV (try for free): The first real test for Missouri (8-0) comes Tuesday with a trip to South Bend. Notre Dame's 5-3 record won't intimidate but its competitiveness against quality competition should. It was a thorn in the side vs. Kansas, Ohio State and Houston, and I'd expect more of the same as the Irish return home from a rough week in Vegas.

For me: Tie goes to the home team in this spot.  The Rebels have lost just once at home to an unranked opponent since Chris Beard took over in 2023 and that trend continues. Expecting big games from Ilias Kamardine and AJ Storr as they shake off consecutive losses to Iowa and Utah from last week. Pick: Ole Miss -2.5 -- Boone\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\nMISS -2.5\r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Ole Miss\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Ole Miss\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Ole Miss\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Ole Miss\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Ole Miss\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Miami\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nSTRAIGHT-UP\r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Ole Miss\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Ole Miss\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Ole Miss\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Ole Miss\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Ole Miss\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Miami\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n       Georgia at Florida State            \r\n\n\r\n\t9 p.m. on ACC Network, fuboTV (try for free): Coming off a 36-point beatdown at the hands of Texas A&M on Friday, Florida State limps into this one tail tucked and, presumably, out to prove a point. That'll be tough to do vs. this Georgia team that is third in scoring margin nationally and first in turnover rate forced defensively. But FSU gets its home venue to try and get back on track – and I expect it does. Taking the points here with the home dog. Pick: FSU -1.5 -- Boone\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\nFSU -1.5\r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Georgia\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Florida St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Florida St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Georgia\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Florida St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Florida St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nSTRAIGHT-UP\r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Georgia\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Florida St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Florida St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Georgia\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Florida St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Florida St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n       No. 16 North Carolina at No. 18 Kentucky            \r\n\n\r\n\t9:30 p.m. on ESPN, fuboTV (try for free): Kentucky's metrics look great (No. 11 at KenPom, No. 15 in the NET) but it is 0-2 with a scoring margin of -25 vs. ranked opponents and 5-0 in its other games – all opponents ranked 208th or worse at KenPom. To put it plainly: We know very little about this UK team but its opportunities to shine this season have thus far made it look dull. In Rupp Arena, that trend changes Tuesday – but I like UNC keeping it close and covering the number.

The Steelers have reportedly filled Slay's roster spot with Asante Samuel Jr., who made his season debut during Pittsburgh's Week 13 loss to the Buffalo Bills.  A six-time Pro Bowler, Slay was part of the Steelers' re-vamped secondary that also included the acquisition of seven-time Pro Bowl cornerback Jalen Ramsey. Injuries, however, and inconsistent performances ultimately led to Slay losing his starting job to James Pierre prior to Pittsburgh's Week 12 loss to the Chicago Bears. Slay was a healthy scratch during this past Sunday's 26-7 loss to Buffalo. Slay's release comes just several weeks after Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said that -- when healthy -- Slay would continue to remain in the starting lineup. Hours before releasing Slay, Tomlin said that him being a healthy scratch this past Sunday was less about Slay and more about him wanting to give Samuel (a former second-round pick who joined Pittsburgh's practice squad last month) an opportunity to play. \nWhile Slay begins the process of looking for his next opportunity, the Steelers will once again have to made sudden adjustments to a secondary that has already gone through through a myriad of them through the season's first 12 weeks. Pittsburgh started the season with Slay, Ramsey and Joey Porter Jr. as their starting cornerbacks and Juan Thornhill and DeShon Elliott as their starting safeties. On Sunday, Pierre is slated to continue starting alongside Porter and Brandin Echols, who entered the starting lineup after Ramsey was moved to free safety after Thornhill was released. Kyle Dugger, who was acquired via a trade with the New England Patriots on Oct. 31, has replaced an injured Elliott at starting strong safety. \nThe Steelers' pass defense -- which is currently 28th in the NFL in passing yards allowed -- will face another stiff test Sunday in Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson, who has also faced his share of struggles this season. Over his past four games, Jackson has completed well under 60% of his pass attempts with just one touchdown and three interceptions. \n            \n    ",

Thielen, after being waived Monday, will get a chance to do just that after being claimed by the Pittsburgh Steelers on Tuesday, per NFL Media. The Vikings traded for Thielen prior to the start of the regular season, as their wide receiving corps was hit hard by injuries. However, in 11 games played this year, Thielen caught just eight passes for 69 yards. He was made a healthy scratch this past week, as the Vikings were blanked by the Seattle Seahawks, 26-0.\n        \n            \n                Vikings release Adam Thielen: Minnesota parts ways with veteran WR, who wants larger role before retiring\n                \n                    Jordan Dajani                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThielen was productive for the Carolina Panthers over the last two seasons, crossing 1,000 yards receiving in 2023, and averaging 61.5 receiving yards per contest in 10 games played in 2024. Thielen, in his 12th NFL season, was picked up by the Vikings as an undrafted free agent in 2013 and ended up playing nine years for the team. He ranks fourth in franchise history in receptions (542), fifth in receiving yards (6,751) and third in receiving touchdowns (55).In Pittsburgh, Thielen joins a wide receiving corps headlined by DK Metcalf, although he is the only pass-catcher to cross 300 yards receiving this season. In Thielen, Aaron Rodgers acquires a veteran playmaker that can move the chains.\nThe 6-6 Steelers find themselves in a heated AFC North race. The Baltimore Ravens, also at 6-6, own the tiebreaker, while the 4-8 Cincinnati Bengals are lurking in the background with Joe Burrow back in the fold. Pittsburgh has a 44.8% chance to win the division, and 45.1% chance to make the playoffs, according to SportsLine data expert Stephen Oh. \n            \n    ",

Durkin has been with the program since 2024, when Hugh Freeze hired him to fix an ailing defense. He made an immediate impact in his first season at Auburn. Under his guidance, the Tigers posted their best rushing defense since 2010 (117.8 ypg), the best total defense since 2017 (330.8 ypg) and the best scoring defense since 2019 (19.5 ppg).Durkin served as Auburn's interim coach after the school fired Hugh Freeze, guiding the Tigers to a 1-2 record and a near upset of rival Alabama in the Tigers' season finale.  Auburn hired Golesh from USF on Sunday as it looks to reclaim a position as an SEC contender after five consecutive losing seasons, the school announced Sunday.\n\"Auburn Football is one of the proudest, most tradition-rich programs in all of college football and my family and I could not be more excited to join the Auburn Family,\" Golesh said in a release. \"This will be a player-driven program, and no one will outwork our staff. Auburn has won, can win and will win championships. Let's get to work.\"Auburn has not had a winning season since Gus Malzahn's final year in 2020 when they went 6-5. Since then, the Tigers have gone 28-35 and have made it to two bowl games, losing both. This year the Tigers went 1-7 in conference play and finished tied for 13th with Mississippi State and South Carolina, with only Arkansas below them. \nAfter back-to-back 7-6 seasons, Golesh led USF to a 9-3 record in 2025 that included wins over Boise State and Florida to start the year. The Bulls eventually slipped out of the American Athletic Conference title race with losses to Memphis and Navy, but still posted their best season in nearly a decade. That performance made Golesh a hot name on the coaching market, and after reportedly turning down Arkansas, Golesh opted to take the opportunity on the Plains. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Texas Tech coach Joey McGuire has agreed to a new seven-year contract, CBS Sports' Shehan Jeyarajah confirms. The deal will keep him in Lubbock through the 2032 season and pay McGuire more than $7 million annually by its conclusion, with incentives that could push his total compensation even higher. The contract comes as the No. 5 Red Raiders prepare to face No. 11 BYU in the Big 12 Championship Game this Saturday. Texas Tech enters at 11-1, marking the program's first appearance in the conference title game. With their record and strong résumé, the Red Raiders are considered essentially locked into the College Football Playoff regardless of the outcome. McGuire, who is in his fifth season at Texas Tech, has steadily built the program into a contender, and this year has been a long-awaited breakthrough for the Red Raiders. Off the field, the school's aggressive investment in NIL deals and revenue-sharing has helped attract and retain top-level talent, a key factor in the team's turnaround. Texas Tech brought in the No. 2 transfer portal class in the country last cycle, according to 247Sports. Hired before the 2022 season, McGuire owns a 34-17 overall record at Texas Tech, leading the program to bowl appearances each year -- only the second coach in school history to do so after the late Mike Leach. His 24 wins in the Big 12 are the most among any current conference team, and Texas Tech is the only program to post an above-.500 conference record each year during that span. \nBefore taking the Texas Tech job, McGuire established himself as one of Texas' top high school coaches, spending more than a decade leading Cedar Hill High School. During his tenure, he turned a struggling program into a state powerhouse, winning three state titles, reaching four championship games, and making the playoffs 12 consecutive seasons.  His success at the high school level earned him a role at Baylor, where he served as an assistant in various roles. McGuire helped improve the Bears' defense and strengthened the recruiting pipeline, further cementing his reputation as a developer of talent and a skilled recruiter. \nThe new contract reflects the program's rising profile and McGuire's success, cementing his place at the helm as Texas Tech seeks to make a run in both the Big 12 and the College Football Playoff. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 Major League Baseball offseason is fully underway, and we're working our way through the sport's offseason calendar. Among other things, the winter in baseball means a steady supply of rumors regarding free agent signings, trades, and the like. Speaking of which, you can find Tuesday's roundup just below. Nats listening on MacKenzie Gore The Nationals under new lead decision-maker Paul Toboni are listening to trade offers on 26-year-old lefty MacKenzie Gore, ESPN reports, but they're not inclined to move him unless they get a particularly strong proposal. \nGore is coming off a 2025 campaign in which he earned his first All-Star selection, but he faded badly down the stretch. One of the key return pieces in the 2022 trade that sent Juan Soto to the Padres, Gore has an ERA+ of 98 across four MLB seasons. He's under team control through the end of the 2027 season. Reds remain in on SchwarberCount the Reds as one of the teams still pursuing designated hitter Kyle Schwarber, according to MLB.com. Cincinnati would like to upgrade an offense that ranked in the middle of the pack in runs scored and in the bottom 10 in park-adjusted offense last season. For whatever it's worth -- and the answer is, usually, \"not much\" -- Schwarber happens to from Ohio. The Phillies, Mets, and Red Sox, among others, are also believed to be involved in the bidding on Schwarber, suggesting he may have to take a serious hometown discount if he's to end up with Cincinnati. \nBrewers inclined to keep PeraltaAfter the Brewers signaled that they may be looking to trim payroll ahead of the 2026 season, many justifiably assumed that ace Freddy Peralta might be on the trade block this winter. While that might yet be the case, ESPN reports that the Brewers for now are inclined to hold the line and enter the 2026 season with Peralta at the front end of a strong rotation that also includes Brandon Woodruff, Jacob Misiorowski, and Quinn Priester. Edwin Díaz return still a possibility for MetsThe Mets' signing of high-leverage reliever Devin Williams gives them an option at closer for 2026 and beyond, but the Williams addition doesn't mean a reunion with Edwin Díaz is out of the question. \nDiscussions with Díaz are ongoing, but to get a deal the two sides will need to bridge a gap in terms of contract length, the Athletic reports. Díaz's side is angling for five years coming off a stellar 2025, but the Mets would prefer not to commit more than three years to the right-hander who's going into his age-32 campaign. Notably, Williams is willing to work in a setup role, which at least in theory clears the decks for a Díaz return. First, though, comes the much more significant hurdle of agreeing to terms. \nWillson Contreras willing to consider tradeCardinals catcher-turned-first baseman Willson Contreras has for some time said he prefers to remain with St. Louis through what's taking shape as a significant rebuild. However, the Athletic reports that stance has changed and Contreras is now willing to consider waiving his no-trade clause for a deal to a contender.\nContreras in 2026 had an OPS+ of 123 with excellent quality-of-contact indicators. He's signed through 2027 and owed $36.5 million over the final two years of his contract. He moved off of the catcher position last season in order to reduce wear and tear and to give way to the Cardinals' glut of catching prospects arriving in the majors. A willingness to return to catching on a part-time basis would likely enhance Contreras' trade value, but it's not yet known whether that's a consideration. Angels add ManoahThe Angels are signing right-hander Alek Manoah to a one-year pact worth less than $2 million, according to ESPN. Manoah, 27, did not pitch in the majors last season and has seldom been healthy and productive at the same time since finishing in third place in the American League's Cy Young Award race in 2022. He figures to compete for a rotation spot next spring.\n            ",

Weis is still expected to follow former Ole Miss coach Lane Kiffin to LSU at the conclusion of the season. Kiffin officially departed Oxford for LSU on Sunday, ending a weeks-long saga that played out amid a historic season for Ole Miss. In a statement, Kiffin said he is supportive of Weis remaining with the Rebels through the postseason. \"With the playoff committee releasing updated rankings tonight, I wanted it to be known that after conversations with LSU, we are allowing Charlie to return to Ole Miss to coach the team during the playoffs,\" Kiffin said. \"I've already made the committee aware of this and I'm hopeful this decision will allow Ole Miss to receive the highest ranking possible because these great players are very deserving of that. I'm excited that Charlie will be back to help coach the greatest team in the history of Ole Miss.\" \nWeis will work under new coach Pete Golding, who was tabbed as Kiffin's permanent successor shortly after Kiffin departed for Baton Rouge. Quarterbacks coach Joe Judge, running backs coach Kevin Smith and offensive line coach John Garrison will also remain with the Rebels through the playoff, at least. \"I'm grateful to LSU for allowing me the opportunity to finish this season with Ole Miss,\" Weis wrote in a statement. \"Coach Kiffin and the LSU administration have been nothing but supportive. I'm excited about the playoff run.\" \n\n        \n            \n                Inside the weeks of turmoil that drove Lane Kiffin from Ole Miss to LSU -- with a hard pass on Florida\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nA majority of Ole Miss' defensive staff remains intact. Secondary coach Bryan Brown is taking Golding's former role as Ole Miss' defensive coordinator. Ole Miss finished the regular season atop the SEC and ranked third nationally in total offense (498.1 yards per game) and finished third in the conference in scoring offense (37.3 points per game). The Rebels were the only SEC team to average at least 300 yards passing and 180 yards rushing per contest. While Ole Miss was willing to allow Weis back into the fold for a month, it did not budge on Kiffin. Though Kiffin claims he wanted to remain in Oxford for the College Football Playoff after he accepted the LSU job, the Rebels informed him that was not possible. \n\"I hate that I didn't get to explain to the players why,\" Kiffin said during his introductory press conference. \"But I also totally respect and understand the decision they felt they had to make for the program.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Los Angeles Lakers superstar Luka Dončić is expected to be sidelined for at least a week with a left finger sprain and lower left leg contusion. Dončić was initially listed as questionable for L.A.'s game against the Sacramento Kings Sunday night, but will instead head to the injury list.It's unclear when the injury occurred, but it's a another big blow for a Lakers team that is already without LeBron James, who is dealing with sciatica and has no timeline for a return. The absence of James was certainly felt in L.A.'s season-opening loss to the Golden State Warriors, but Dončić's heroics carried the Lakers to a blowout win against the Timberwolves. Dončić's play through the first two games is nothing short of MVP-level. He's averaging an absurd 46 points, 11.5 rebounds and 8.5 assists and nearly notched a triple-double in a 128-110 win over the Timberwolves in which completely dismantled Minnesota's defense. With Dončić expected to miss a week, that means he'll miss matchups against the Kings, Trail Blazers, Timberwolves, Grizzlies and Heat. And with no update on James as of late, that means the Lakers will likely be without both of their star players for the foreseeable future.\nWith Dončić and James out, that means Austin Reaves will slide into the No. 1 option role for the Lakers. He's averaging 25.5 points, 10 assists and six rebounds for the Lakers so far, and now he will be asked to do even more with L.A.'s top two players sidelined. That also means will see a bigger scoring role for Rui Hachimura, who is off to a career-best start to the season (16 points, three rebounds).In regards to who will fill that vacancy in the starting lineup with Dončić out, JJ Redick could keep the three-guard lineup by putting Marcus Smart in there. He could also put Jake LaRavia in with the starting unit to keep some size and shooting on the floor. Regardless of who Redick puts out there, though, it's going to be an uphill battle for at least the next week without both Dončić and James.\nIt'll be a tough road ahead for the Lakers, especially in a Western Conference where a down week can be the difference in making the playoffs or not. That seems ridiculous to talk about given we're barely a week into the season, but that's the reality of the gauntlet that is the Western Conference.\n            \n    ",

In finding the end zone three times en route to a blowout win, Allen notched his 46th career game with both a passing and rushing touchdown. That surpassed the mark of 45 such games that Cam Newton racked up throughout his career, making Allen the NFL's new leader. Coincidentally, Allen broke the record against Newton's old team.The history-making touchdown came in thrilling fashion, too. Allen hit Khalil Shakir for an explosive 54-yard scoring pass with 12:18 left in the third quarter, which at the time extended the Bills' lead to 23 points. He notched his first rushing score earlier in the game when he punched the ball in from a yard out late in the second quarter.\nLater in the third quarter, Allen made even more history with his second rushing score of the afternoon. The lunge into the end zone made him just the second quarterback in league history with 70 career rushing touchdowns.\nAllen closed the day with modest yardage but was immensely efficient in the rout of the Panthers. He completed 12 of 19 passes for 163 yards and the big-play touchdown, and he added three carries for seven yards and his two scores.\n        \n            \n                Mark Sanchez breaks silence, Rex Ryan gets emotional in tributes to Nick Mangold, dead at 41\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSunday's outstanding performance is the latest in a string of them for Allen to start the season. Buffalo's superstar quarterback is in the heat of the NFL MVP race and, per FanDuel, and has the second-best odds to win the award (+330), trailing only Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes (+140).\nDespite the historic effort from their quarterback, the Bills got most of their offensive production from running back James Cook. The fourth-year standout set a new career high with 216 rushing yards, crossing the 200-yard mark for his first time as a pro. He now has four games with at least 100 yards through seven outings.\n            \n    ",

No. 4 Alabama escaped Columbia with a 29-22 victory despite quite the scare from South Carolina. The Crimson Tide scored 15 points in the final 2:16 of regulation to move to 7-1. It was the second fourth-quarter comeback for coach Kalen DeBoer as the coach of the Tide, and both have come against the Gamecocks. No. 16 Virginia almost gave Bill Belichick his first ACC win, but escaped Chapel Hill with a 17-16 victory in overtime. The Cavaliers moved up one spot in the newest AP poll. Arch Manning and No. 22 Texas recorded their largest comeback (17 points) since 2007, as the Longhorns defeated Mississippi State, 45-38 in overtime. Texas is now up to No. 20.Elsewhere, No. 10 Vanderbilt moved to 7-1 with a 17-10 victory over No. 15 Missouri, who lost quarterback Beau Pribula to a gruesome leg injury. Vandy rose one spot to No. 9 while Mizzou tumbled to No. 19. Lane Kiffin finally got that signature road win in Oklahoma, as his No. 8 Ole Miss Rebels defeated the Sooners, 34-26. Ole Miss moved up one spot to No. 7, while Oklahoma fell five spots to No. 18. We have to give some love to the American Conference as well as unranked Memphis came back from down 14 points in the fourth quarter to upset No. 18 USF, 34-31. Memphis is now 7-1 on the year and 2-1 this season when trailing by two touchdowns. The Tigers are No. 25 in the newest AP poll, while South Florida fell out. No. 3 Texas A&M looks to be the real deal after destroying No. 20 LSU, 49-25, in Death Valley. The Tigers have lost three out of the past four games after starting the season 4-0. Coach Brian Kelly is 5-11 vs. AP ranked teams, and his team is no longer in the top 25. Below is the full AP Top 25 for Week 10.

    "body": "\n        The Denver Broncos (5-2) will host the Dallas Cowboys (3-3-1) in what promises to be an entertaining NFL Week 8 matchup on CBS and Paramount+. Bo Nix and the Broncos are coming off a wild win against the New York Giants, where a 33-point fourth quarter led them to a 33-32 victory. The Cowboys are also coming off a win, defeating NFC East rivals the Washington Commanders, 44-22. Kickoff from Empower Field at Mile High is set for 4:25 p.m. ET on CBS and Paramount+. Denver is a 3.5-point favorite in the latest Cowboys vs. Broncos odds from SportsLine consensus, while the over/under for total points scored is 51.5.

Dak Prescott threw for 264 yards and had three touchdowns in that game, and his stats have soared since getting CeeDee Lamb back on the field. The downside for Dallas is they are giving up the most total yards per game (401.6) and receiving yards per game (260.3), and the third-most rushing yards per game (141.3) and points (29.4).   The opposite is true of the Broncos, who allow the third-fewest yards per game (273.1) and the fourth-fewest points (18.1). Denver's offense is averaging 347.0 total yards per game and should be confident after rallying against the Giants, but probably can't afford to have Nix waiting for fourth-quarter magic a second week in a row. They will be leaning on J.K. Dobbins to lead the charge against the Dallas run defense.Click here to bet Cowboys vs. Broncos at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if their first bet of at least $5 wins:Model's Cowboys vs. Broncos score prediction, picksDallas is 4-3-0 ATS this season compared to Denver at 2-4-1 ATS.

    "body": "\n        The top and bottom of the NFC South standings face off in NFL Week 8 as the New Orleans Saints (1-6) host the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (5-2). It will be a quick turnaround for Baker Mayfield and the Bucs, who fell 24-9 to the Detroit Lions on Monday Night Football. Meanwhile, Spencer Rattler and the Saints are still looking for their second win of the season following consecutive losses against the New England Patriots and Chicago Bears. Kickoff from Caesars Superdome is set for 4:05 p.m. ET. Tampa Bay is a 3.5-point favorite in the latest Buccaneers vs. Saints odds from SportsLine consensus, while the over/under for total points scored is 46.5.

Mayfield only completed 28-of-50 passes, and his MVP odds have been dented, and it will be up to him to right the ship against the Saints' passing defense with both Mike Evans and Chris Godwin Jr. sidelined. Tampa Bay's defense is allowing 25.0 points per game, but can clamp down against an offense that has scored more than 20 points just twice this season.  The Saints have been able to keep games close this season despite scoring the fourth-fewest points per game in the NFL (17.9). The defense has struggled to keep opponents out of the endzone, and its only chance at keeping Sunday's game close is to manage Tampa Bay's ground game since Bucky Irving won't play due to a foot injury. History hasn't been on the Saints' side in this head-to-head matchup, either, and the Bucs have won four of the last five meetings.Click here to bet Buccaneers vs. Saints at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if their first bet of at least $5 wins:Model's Buccaneers vs. Saints score prediction, picksThe Bucs are 4-3-0 ATS on the season while the Saints are 2-5-0 ATS, although Tampa Bay is 4-10-0 ATS in its last 14 games against New Orleans.

    "body": "\n        Sunday's NFL schedule features three games in the 4 p.m. ET window, including the Denver Broncos hosting another NFC East team after one of the wildest football games you'll ever see. The Broncos scored 33 points in the fourth quarter to come back and defeat the Giants, 33-32, last week, and although it doesn't believe it will come with the same theatrics, the SportsLine model projects the Broncos to knock off another NFC East team when they play the Cowboys at 4:25 p.m. ET. The Broncos are favored by 3.5 points in the latest Week 8 NFL odds, while the over/under for total points scored is 51.5, up four from the opening line. The model's two other best bets for the late-afternoon window involve totals, backing Over 47 total points in Colts vs. Titans at 4:25 p.m. ET, and Under 46.5 points in Buccaneers vs. Saints at 4:05 p.m. ET. The model projects the Over to hit in 64% of simulations for Titans vs. Colts in a game where the Colts are favored by 14 points.

Bet it now at FanDuel:Broncos (-3.5) vs. CowboysDespite allowing 32 points to the Giants last week, the Broncos still have a top-five statistical defense after entering last Week No. 2 in defensive scoring and yards allowed. Denver is fourth in scoring defense (18.1 points per game allowed) and third in yards allowed (273.1 per game). The Broncos also showed how dominant their offense can be when it's rolling, scoring 33 points in the fourth quarter last week, which is tied for the second-most points in a fourth quarter in NFL history. While Denver has a top defense in the league, the Cowboys have arguably the worst, ranking 30th in points per game (29.4) while allowing the most yards per game (401.6). The model projects Denver to carry last weekend's finish into Sunday, with the Broncos covering in 56% of simulations.Colts vs. Titans: Over 47 pointsIf it's a week or two, it's fair to wonder if it's a fluke, but after seven weeks of offensive dominance, it's about time NFL fans accept the Colts' offense is for real. Indianapolis has the No. 1 scoring offense in the NFL at 33.1 ppg. The Colts have scored at least 29 points in six of seven games ahead of a matchup against Tennessee, which is 28th in the league in scoring defense at 27.4 ppg allowed this season. The Titans have allowed at least 20 points in all seven games this season, including 31 against the Patriots last week. The Colts have allowed at least 20 points in five of their last six games, though, so the Titans should have chances to score as well, leading the model to project the Over to hit in 64% of simulations.Buccaneers vs. Saints Under 46.5 points The injuries may be catching up to Tampa Bay's offense, which will once again be without Mike Evans for a significant stretch after the six-time Pro-Bowl receiver suffered a broken collarbone in his return on Monday Night Football. Tampa Bay was held to a season-low nine points on Monday Night Football, 11 points fewer than any other game this season. Meanwhile, the Saints have reached 20 points only once over their last five games as New Orleans ranks 29th in scoring at 17.9 ppg this season. The model projects the Under to hit in 57% of simulations.Want more Week 8 NFL picks?You've seen the model's Week 8 NFL best bets for Sunday.

Hendrickson, who had been nursing an issue with his hip entering Sunday's game, was forced to leave after suffering the injury during the second quarter.After rushing against Jets offensive lineman Olu Fashanu, Hendrickson went down and writhed in pain momentarily after taking a hit from John Simpson before getting back up on his feet and trying to jog off. Hendrickson was seen moving gingerly to the locker room and was subsequently declared out for the rest of the game.\nIn the week leading up to Sunday's game, Hendrickson had been limited in practice Wednesday and Thursday before sitting out practice Friday. The loss of Hendrickson deprives Cincinnati of their best pass rusher, as he has four sacks so far this season after leading the NFL with 17.5 a year ago.\nFollowing Hendrickson's injury, the Bengals went into the locker room for halftime up 24-13 on the visiting Jets.\n            \n    ",

The skid is not sitting well among Tiger faithful, and Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry spoke up with his displeasure, questioning LSU's move to raise ticket prices for the 2026 season after another loss.The LSU Board of Supervisors approved on Friday a measure that will increase season ticket prices for the 2026 campaign. According to The Advocate, prices will increase by up to $125 and provide an estimated $4.5 million in additional revenue to the athletic department.\"I think @LSUsports and the LSU Board of Supervisors needs to rethink their actions to raise ticket prices for next year after tonight's showing!\" Landry said on social media.LSU said in a statement to The Advocate that it carefully adjusted ticket prices on demand to ensure they better align with market rates. Prices for the most desirable sections will increase by $125 while other zones will see smaller hikes ranging from $25 to $100.\"Price changes focus on areas with high renewal rates and high secondary market values,\" LSU said in its statement. \"LSU is not changing any pricing in the upper deck other than the Skyline Club, which includes food and beverage in the ticket price. Keeping upper deck season ticket prices as they are currently will allow LSU Athletics to be more flexible with individual game prices and provides an additional option for fans to purchase season tickets at a lower price point.\"\nThe board also approved season parking pass pricing and the addition of two new paid lots. Fans will be charged up to $1,500 for season passes.\n        \n            \n                LSU's Brian Kelly acknowledges boos are fair, says job decision 'out of my hands' after blowout loss\n                \n                    Cody Nagel                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe timing of these announced price increases could not be much worse for LSU fans, who just watched as the Tigers saw their College Football Playoff hopes effectively go out the window with their latest loss. The 49-25 defeat was the most lopsided loss since last year's 42-13 disaster against Alabama, which also came on the Tigers' home turf.Coach Brian Kelly is under the microscope for leading another disappointing season and in all likelihood missing the CFP for the fourth time in as many years at the helm. Kelly constructed a roster that many believed was capable of contending for a national championship, but underwhelming offensive play proved costly in three losses and overshadowed the defensive progress the program made in the offseason.\nThis season could continue to unravel in the coming weeks with a pair of ranked matchups left on the schedule. LSU heads to No. 4 Alabama on the other side of its bye week and closes the regular season with a trip to No. 18 Oklahoma.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The NFL community and New York Jets lost one of their own Sunday following the death of 41-year-old former offensive lineman Nick Mangold, due to complications from kidney disease. Former Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez and coach Rex Ryan were among those associated with the franchise who reacted to the news with heartfelt condolences to the Mangold family.Posting on social media for the first time since June, Sanchez penned an emotional tribute to his former teammate and longtime friend.\"We lost a good man today. I know Nick Mangold will be a hall-of-famer, but there's more to his story than his accomplishments on the gridiron,\" Sanchez wrote on X. \"He was more than a teammate. He was my big brother who introduced me to the NFL. He showed me the ropes. He was my friend and confidant. He was a role model and a great father to his children and husband to his wife. Our hearts are heavy. We will miss you. Rest easy amigo. I love you big fella. No. 74.\" \n        \n            \n                Nick Mangold dies at 41: Jets legend, seven-time Pro Bowler had lengthy battle with kidney disease\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMangold spent 11 seasons with the Jets, five of those with Sanchez as the team's starting quarterback.\nRyan, New York's coach during the Mangold-Sanchez tenure, mourned the loss of his former player live on television during Sunday's appearance on \"NFL Countdown.\"\n\"It's brutal, such a great young man. ... I had the pleasure of coaching him all six years with the Jets,\" Ryan said, fighting back tears.\"I remember, it was obvious I was getting fired, my last game ... Mangold's injured. Like injured. And he comes to me and says, 'I'm playing this game.' And he wanted to play for me. That's what I remembered about this kid. And he's just way too young. I feel so bad for his wife and family. Rough.\"\nMangold, who recently revealed he was going through dialysis and needed a kidney transplant, was an iron man of sorts during his career with the Jets, missing only four starts during his first 10 seasons.The multi-time All-Pro was one of the NFL's top centers during his time and helped New York reach consecutive AFC title games during the 2009 and 2010 seasons.Mangold is survived by his wife, Jennifer, and their four children -- Matthew, Eloise, Thomas and Charlotte.\n\"Nick was more than a legendary center,\" Jets owner Woody Johnson said in a statement. \"He was the heartbeat of our offensive line for a decade and a beloved teammate whose leadership and toughness defined an era of Jets football. Off the field, Nick's wit, warmth, and unwavering loyalty made him a cherished member of our extended Jets family.\"The former Ohio State star was inducted into the Jets' Ring of Honor in 2022.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Texas quarterback Arch Manning suffered a concussion during overtime of the Longhorns' 45-38 win over Mississippi State on Saturday night, Horns247 reports, after his head made contact with the turf at the end of a 13-yard scramble. Longhorns coach Steve Sarkisian offered no update post-game, saying \"we'll find out more when we get back to Austin\" before moving on to questions.According to Horns247 through sources, Manning will be reevaluated Sunday and Sarkisian is expected to provide an update on his quarterback during Monday's regularly-scheduled availability.Manning knifed his way through the heart of Mississippi State's defense in the extra session with the score tied at 38 before he was tackled by Bulldogs safety Isaac Smith and defensive lineman Kedrick Bingley-Jones, who hit him from behind.\n        \n            \n                Coaches Poll top 25: Texas A&M gets first-place votes, Vanderbilt surges in Week 10 college football rankings\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nManning tried to get up with the help of Texas offensive tackle Brandon Baker before motioning for trainers from a seated position on the turf. Matthew Caldwell, Manning's backup, threw a 10-yard touchdown pass on the possession to Emmett Mosley V that was the eventual game-winning score.\nManning had previously led a 17-point comeback in the fourth quarter to force overtime on the road after the Longhorns trailed 38-21. Texas is the first SEC team to overcome a 17-point deficit in the final frame to win since 2013.Manning finished with his best game as a collegian, completing 29 of 46 attempts for 346 yards and three touchdowns to go along with a score on the ground.Concussion protocolAccording to the university's concussion management plan, post-concussion management is directed by the team physician and the need for initial physical and cognitive rest will be determined based on individual serial assessments, concussion history, modifying factors and specific needs of the student-athlete.\nFinal authority for \"return to play\" resides with the Longhorns' team physician. The NCAA's concussion safety protocol management mandates Manning would need to be cleared by medical personnel before returning to play. This week's first availability report for Vanderbilt-Texas comes out Wednesday, followed by status updates each day leading up to gameday.At 6-2 overall and 3-1 in conference play, Texas enters a pivotal final stretch beginning with next weekend's tilt against the 10th-ranked Commodores at DKR-Texas Memorial Stadium. Sarkisian's team is off the following week before traveling to fifth-ranked Georgia, hosting Arkansas and then entertaining the SEC's lone unbeaten, Texas A&M, in the regular-season finale on Nov. 28.\nWinning out from here would not only guarantee a third consecutive playoff appearance for the Longhorns, but would but a ticket to Atlanta in the SEC Championship Game.\n            ",

Green Bay's run defense is allowing the second-fewest yards per game (76.5) and will aim to punish Pittsburgh's modest run game. Meanwhile, Love is averaging 8.2 yards per pass with a 69.3% completion rate and a 10-2 TD-INT ratio, so he should be eager to air the ball out against a Steelers defense that allowed Flacco to throw for 342 yards with three touchdowns. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Steelers can coverPittsburgh is 3-3-0 ATS on the season and 2-1-0 ATS at home, compared to Green Bay which is 2-4-0 ATS and has failed to cover as the betting favorite in four straight games. Rodgers has thrown for 1,270 yards through six games -- the fourth-most in the NFL -- and has a 14-5 TD-INT ratio following a four-touchdown outing against the Bengals. The T.J. Watt-led defense is allowing 374.7 total yards per game but has been good at forcing the opposition into making mistakes, and isn't likely to take its foot off the gas like Arizona's defense did against Green Bay in Week 7. See which team to back at SportsLine. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to make Steelers vs. Packers picksFor 'Sunday Night Football' in NFL Week 8, the model is leaning over the total, projecting 46 total points, and also says one side of the spread hits in well over 50% of simulations. See what it is at SportsLine.Who wins Packers vs. Steelers, and which side of the spread hits well over 50% of the time?

    "body": "\n        Although it won't come in Green Bay, Aaron Rodgers has his chance to get some revenge against the franchise where he spent the first 18 years of his career. For the first time in his 21-year career, Rodgers plays the Packers, and the Future Hall of Fame quarterback can become the fifth quarterback in NFL history to defeat all 32 teams. Although the SportsLine model does not project the 41-year-old quarterback to cross the goal line himself, it does expect Rodgers to throw for at least one touchdown, and it sees value in multiple Steelers pass-catchers to include in Sunday Night Football anytime touchdown scorer bets when online sports betting.DK Metcalf has built a solid rapport with Rodgers in Pittsburgh, and the big-bodied receiver has scored a touchdown in four of his last five games. The model likes that trend to continue, including Metcalf in its Packers vs. Steelers Sunday Night Football anytime TD scorer best bets at +145 odds. It also sees value in a longshot Steelers pass-catcher to score a touchdown, backing tight end Jonnu Smith at +285 odds to score for the second straight week. The model also sees value in Packers running back Josh Jacobs, who, despite having the lowest odds at -185 to score a touchdown on Sunday Night Football, the model believes his odds should be in the -200 range. Before making any Packers vs. Steelers picks or anytime touchdown scorer props at sportsbooks, be sure to see the Week 8 NFL predictions from SportsLine's proven model and see the latest NFL odds.

He averaged 4.2 yards per carry last week against the Cardinals after averaging 5.2 yards per rush against the Bengals the week before in his two most efficient games of the season. Jacobs has played at least 65% of snaps in five of six games this season as a true workhorse running back, and with the way Jacobs has been running lately, he'll be near impossible to keep out of the end zone on Sunday Night Football.Click here to play Jacobs in Week 8 Sunday Night Football anytime TD scorer bets at FanDuel, where new users receive $300 in bonus bets if their first $5 bet wins. DK Metcalf, Steelers (+145)Metcalf has a touchdown in four of his last five games, and with Rodgers facing the Packers for the first time in his career, you know the future Hall of Fame quarterback is going to do all he can to throw at least one touchdown. Metcalf is the only Steelers pass-catcher with more than two touchdowns, with his four scores doubling anyone else on the team. He's a physical presence that any team will have a hard time matching, and the time Metcalf and Rodgers spent working out together during parts of the offseason has quickly transferred onto the field. Metcalf didn't score a touchdown last week, but the model projects Rodgers to make sure that changes on Sunday Night Football.Click here to bet on Metcalf as a Sunday Night Football anytime TD scorer with the latest Caesars Sportsbook promo code CBS20X, which gives new users 20 100% profit boost tokens with their first $1 bet.Jonnu Smith, Steelers (+275)The Steelers tight end scored last week, and Steelers offensive coordinator Arthur Smith knows how to get the most out of Smith. The duo's connection goes back to their days with Arthur Smith as the Titans' tight ends coach with Jonnu Smith there. Jonnu also played for the Falcons with Arthur Smith as head coach. Although it isn't a coach's son situation with the two sharing surnames, it may sometimes seem that way with the play calling. But Jonnu Smith has earned his targets. He has two touchdowns in six games this year, and given how aggressive Rodgers will likely be with his arm, especially near the end zone, the model loves the chance to play Smith at near 3-1 odds.Click here to bet on Smith as a Sunday Night Football anytime TD scorer with the latest Caesars Sportsbook promo code CBS20X, which gives new users 20 100% profit boost tokens with their first $1 bet.Want more Week 8 NFL picks?You've seen the model's NFL anytime touchdown scorer prop picks for Packers vs. Steelers in Week 8 Sunday Night Football.

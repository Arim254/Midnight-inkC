The Ravens crushed the Browns 41-17 as 12.5-point home chalk despite getting outgained 322-242 back in Week 2 with Joe Flacco under center... Myles Garrett called out his team after last week's loss, and the Browns will be highly motivated in this division matchup. With 15-25 mph winds and a 50% chance of light rain, we have the makings of a closer-than-expected low-scoring contest.\" Hochman's NFL best bets for Week 11 can be found here.Eagles vs. Lions 'Sunday Night Football' picksNFC contenders meet on 'Sunday Night Football' as the Lions travel to take on the Eagles. Philadelphia has bounced back from a shocking road loss against the Giants to win three straight. The Lions, meanwhile, blew out Washington last week 44-22, and they've now alternated wins and losses in their last five games. R.J. White is on a sizzling 13-1 run on NFL spread picks, and he's backing Detroit (+2.5).\"The Eagles gutted out a tough win in Green Bay on Monday, but it was not an impressive showing by their offense, which managed eight or fewer yards in six of 10 offensive series,\" he told SportsLine. \"The defense was very much bend but don't break, with the Packers scoring once on six drives into Philly territory. This is a much tougher opponent, especially with Dan Campbell taking over playcalling duties on offense. The Lions also have a D-line capable of neutralizing Philly's strength up front and limiting scoring once again. I expect the Lions to win this game outright.\" Get more 'Sunday Night Football' picks at SportsLine.Cowboys vs. Raiders 'Monday Night Football' picksDallas plays its first ever game in Vegas as the Cowboys and Raiders conclude the Week 12 NFL schedule on 'Monday Night Football.' The Cowboys are 3.5-point favorites, with the over/under at 50. Larry Hartstein is on a 40-24 run on NFL player props (+1122), and he's backing George Pickens to go Over 66.5 total receiving yards. \"George Pickens averages a whopping 3.41 yards per route run against Cover 3 -- a coverage the Raiders use at the NFL's second-highest rate,\" he said. \"He's cleared this prop total in four straight games and seven of the last eight. Pickens will be matched up often with third-round rookie Darien Porter, who allows 12.3 yards per completion and has yet to force an incompletion, per PFF. This game has the highest total on the Week 11 slate, so I'm expecting another big game from Pickens.\" Get more 'Monday Night Football' picks at SportsLine.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Eleven more NFL games are set for Sunday afternoon either in the 1 p.m. ET or 4:05/4:25 p.m. ET window, and those matchups comprise the main slate for NFL DFS sites like FanDuel and DraftKings. One of the early kickoffs -- Bengals vs. Steelers-- has the highest over/under (49.5) for the week, so that game should be a focus for NFL daily Fantasy players with big names like Aaron Rodgers, Ja'Marr Chase and D.K. Metcalf in action. Other big names expected to be playing on the main slate include Justin Herbert, Bijan Robinson and Christian McCaffrey. Lamar Jackson (knee) missed practice on Wednesday, but returned Thursday and Friday and carries no injury designation, clearing him to be part of the player pool as well. How should they factor into your NFL DFS picks this week, and who are the sleepers in the NFL DFS player pool that can help differentiate your lineups?

Playing in a more run-centric Jim Harbaugh offense limited his Fantasy production last year, but a rash of injuries at running back has Los Angeles throwing the ball more in 2025 with Ladd McConkey, Keenan Allen, Quentin Johnston and tight end Oronde Gadsden II all putting up big numbers. Herbert and the Chargers face the Jaguars, who have given up the second-most Fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks this season. See who else to pick here.The optimizer's NFL DFS strategy also includes building around Atlanta receiver Drake London at $8,400 on FanDuel and $7,400 on DraftKings. The fourth-year pro is pacing for career-best number across the board as he enters Week 11 with a 53-691-6 receiving line. He faces a tougher matchup against a Carolina defense that has been solid overall against the pass. London, however, dominated the Panthers in their second meeting last year, posting a massive 10-187-2 line, giving him huge upside at a value price on Sunday. You can see the rest of the optimizer's NFL DFS picks here.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to build Sunday Week 11 NFL DFS lineupsThe NFL DFS Optimizer is also targeting multiple undervalued players who could explode for huge numbers on Sunday.

He gave daily Fantasy football players a scare on Wednesday when he missed practice with a knee injury, but he was back by Thursday and he carries no injury designation heading into his matchup with the Browns. With that favorable matchup, and complemented by the likes of Derrick Henry, Zay Flowers and Mark Andrews, can you trust Jackson in NFL DFS lineups, even if he is dealing with some knee soreness?Other top potential NFL DFS picks on the main slate at quarterback include Josh Allen, Baker Mayfield and Caleb Williams.

Warren isn't putting up eye-popping numbers, but he's finding ways to be productive for DFS players. He scored twice in Week 9 despite averaging just 1.9 yards per carry that week. He was far more efficient in Week 10, averaging 5.0 yards per carry. The Bengals have given up more Fantasy yardage to opposing running backs than any other team, setting up a potential big day for Warren. See who else to roster at SportsLine.Another one of McClure's NFL DFS picks is Vikings receiver Justin Jefferson at $7,500 on DraftKings and $,8600 on FanDuel, who is a nice bounce-back option after only catching four passes for 37 yards last week.

    "body": "\n        There's a lot of teams in contention for biggest disappointment of 2025. Penn State entered the year ranked second with its eyes on a Big Ten title and a repeat appearance in the College Football Playoff, but it fired longtime coach James Franklin amid an 0-3 start to conference play. This was supposed to be the year that Florida finally got it going under Billy Napier. He was ousted before the calendar turned to November. Clemson and LSU both quickly dropped from preseason top 10 to unranked. But it's Texas that has set a new bar in futility. The Longhorns made history as a preseason No. 1. They were expected to compete for a national title with ballyhooed young quarterback Arch Manning leading the way. Those hopes took a significant hit in a Week 1 loss to Ohio State. It's been downhill since. Manning has been more hype than substance to this point. Granted, he hasn't had a ton of help. \nTexas was unable to overcome significant losses at wide receiver and along the offensive line as both of those units have played very poorly. This is also the worst rushing attack that coach Steve Sarkisian has had since coming to Austin. Not to be outdone, the defense has been a complete dud. The Longhorns have allowed 34.7 points per game over their last three games. \n        \n            \n                Tom Fornelli's CFP Vibe Check, Week 12: Texas poised to start arguments, Big Ten gets results it needed\n                \n                    Tom Fornelli                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTheir 35-10 Week 12 loss against Georgia provided irrefutable proof that Texas isn't anywhere close to being a premier program in the SEC. The Longhorns look woefully outmatched against most teams with a similar talent level, and they're much closer to middling than they are to elite. \nDiscussion of Texas as a potential playoff team is absurd. This is the type of year that should prompt Sarkisian to make some significant changes or he could be in hot water in 2026. Kalen DeBoer isn't going to get Alabama where it wants to goKalen DeBoer is a very good football coach. There's no denying that. He's one of a handful of active coaches that can flaunt a College Football Playoff National Championship appearance. He's a proven winner at every level of the sport. In fact, he's never had a losing record as a coach, dating back 20 years to his first season at Sioux Falls. He's nowhere near the hot seat, and he shouldn't be. It is clear, though, that he's not going to take Alabama where it wants to go. \nMaybe Alabama fans need to reset their expectations in the wake of Nick Saban's retirement. Saban is one of one. It's absurd to expect anyone to match the standard set by the greatest coach to ever grace college football. But there are some recurring issues that will severely limit Alabama's upside beyond occasional College Football Playoff appearances. Saturday's 23-21 loss to No. 11 Oklahoma was a microcosm of the problems that have plagued DeBoer. Alabama's offensive line continues to under-perform relative to talent level. The Crimson Tide don't have a run game to speak of, which is an especially tough pill to swallow when, injuries aside, former top rushing option Justice Haynes is having a great year at Michigan. \nOffensive consistency has escaped Alabama during DeBoer's tenure. Quarterback Ty Simpson has been mostly excellent this season, and he provides a more stable floor than Jalen Milroe did. But, like Milroe, when Simpson is off, he's very off. He was off against the Sooners with multiple misses in key situations. It was reminiscent of the Simpson that appeared in Alabama's season-opening loss to Florida State. Jake Dickert was the best hire during 2024-25 carousel Last year's coaching carousel was relatively quiet -- especially in comparison to its chaotic spinning this season. But there were a few headline-grabbing moves, such as North Carolina's stunning decision to hire Bill Belichick, Scott Frost's return to UCF and Dan Mullen breaking back into coaching at UNLV. There was enough going on that former Washington State coach Jake Dickert's move to Wake Forest went largely unnoticed. It's becoming more apparent with each passing week that the Demon Deacons hit a grand slam with Dickert. He didn't command the spotlight, but he is the best first-year coach in college football. \nHe had big shoes to fill by replacing Dave Clawson while simultaneously inheriting a Wake Forest program that won just three ACC games from 2023-24. It hasn't taken him long to turn things around. Wake Forest improved to 7-3 with a Week 12 win over Belichick's Tar Heels. That includes four victories against conference opponents, which is the most that the Demon Deacons have had sine 2021. This is one week after Wake Forest went on the road and downed No. 12 Virginia, handing the Cavaliers their first ACC loss of the season. That represented Wake Forest's highest-ranked road win in almost 50 years -- the Demon Deacons beat No. 12 Georgia in 1979. Dickert's side is also responsible for SMU's only conference loss thus far. The future is bright in Winston-Salem with Dickert leading the charge. Kewan Lacy is the most underrated player in college football No. 7 Ole Miss found a transfer portal diamond in running back Kewan Lacy, who spent his freshman season at Missouri before taking his talents to Oxford. Landing Lacy was a program-defining move for the Rebels and coach Lane Kiffin. \nFor all of his success at Ole Miss, Kiffin's tenure with the Rebels has often been marred by letdowns. Ole Miss seemed like a surefire College Football Playoff team last season until it lost to a pair of lesser opponents in Kentucky and Florida. A road loss to unranked LSU in 2022 sent the Rebels spiraling from a 7-0 start to 1-5 in their last six games. It's a pattern that was likely on the minds of Ole Miss fans as their favorite team kicked off against Florida Saturday evening. And, if it wasn't for Lacy, the Rebels may suffered an all-too familiar fate. He almost singlehandedly downed the Gators while rushing for 224 yards and three touchdowns on 31 carries. By comparison, Florida had 108 yards rushing as a team. \nThat brought Lacy's season-long rushing touchdown total to 19, which is an Ole Miss record. Thanks to Lacy, Ole Miss' path to the playoff is still wide open. Makai Lemon will win the Biletnikoff Award USC wide receiver Makai Lemon is playing better than any wide receiver in the nation right now. He's certainly made a lot of money for himself in a draft year. Lemon has solidified his status as a first-round prospect and there's an argument to be made that he should be the first skill position star taken off the board come April. Don't let Lemon's 5-foot-11 frame fool you -- he is a contested catch specialist with excellent route running chops. Throw it anywhere near Lemon and there's a good chance that he'll come down with it. He had several jaw-dropping snags in No. 17 USC's 26-21 win against No. 21 Iowa Saturday. \nLemon had 10 catches for 153 yards and one score against the Hawkeyes, which put him over 1,000 yards for the year. It was his third game this season with at least 150 yards through the air. He's reached that mark three times since conference play began. Lemon will have some stiff award season competition from Jeremiah Smith and Carnell Tate, Ohio State's phenomenal wide receiver duo, and the likes of Louisville's Chris Bell. But his name will ultimately be the one etched on the Biletnikoff Award. \n            ",

There are nine divisional contests you could make Week 11 NFL picks on, the most of any week thus far.

Washington is taking on Miami in the first NFL game in Madrid, while Eagles vs. Lions (+2.5) takes place on SNF.

Being at home doesn't appear to be much of an advantage for the Vikings, who committed eight false starts during a Sunday home loss to Baltimore. That's the second-most false starts by a home team in a game since 2000, as J.J. McCarthy has struggled in his debut season. He has six interceptions and four fumbles (one lost) across his four starts while being sacked 15 times. Meanwhile, Chicago has won six of its last seven games, going 5-2 ATS over that stretch. The model has Chicago prevailing versus the spread over 50% of the time. See which other teams to pick here.\nAnother one of its Week 11 NFL predictions: the Steelers (-5.5, 48.5) cover at home versus the Bengals in well over 50% of simulations. Cincy owns the worst defense, by far, in the NFL, ranking dead last in points allowed and yards allowed, with bottom-three rankings in pass defense, takeaways and redzone defense. Additionally, its three spread victories this year are tied for the fewest in the league, and coming off a bye won't give the Bengals much of an edge as the team is 1-5 ATS over its last six games with a rest advantage. On the other hand, Pittsburgh is 8-4 ATS at home since the start of last year, and its No. 16 offense could look like a top-five unit versus Cincy. The model projects Pittsburgh to score a touchdown more than its season average as the Steelers cover. SportsLine's advanced model also says the Over hits in over 50% of simulations. See which other teams to pick here.\nHow to make Week 11 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 11 NFL schedule and just revealed two underdogs that outright win, potentially giving you a huge payday.

That's because the Arizona offense has been good with Jacoby Brissett at QB, scoring 22+ in all four of his starts despite facing the Colts, Packers and Seahawks in that stretch,\" CBS Sports Gambling and Fantasy editor R.J. White said. \"The 49ers defense has given up 23+ in six of the last seven games and couldn't stop a beat-up Houston offense a few weeks ago. Last week was the first time all year the Cardinals lost by more than four points, and the 49ers haven't been playing well enough to be considered among their toughest opponents, especially with the game in Arizona.\" Back Arizona at FanDuel Sportsbook:Over 38.5 points in Ravens vs. Browns (-110)Baltimore has ripped off three wins in a row after its bye week and has worked itself back into the AFC North title picture. However, while the defense has gotten healthier and started to settle in a little, it's the running game that fuels this franchise at this point. Meanwhile, the Cleveland defense ranks second in the NFL in yards allowed but only 17th in scoring defense. The Ravens scored 76 points on their own in two matchups with the Browns last season and the Over his now hit in each of their last four head-to-head matchups. The model predicts 44 points on average and that the Over hits in 60% of simulations. Back the Over at FanDuel Sportsbook:Lions +2.5 vs. Eagles (-104)\"Last week's defensive win does not mask the ten points the offense put up, which is the fewest under Jalen Hurts in a game he started and finished,\" SportsLine NFL expert Zack Cimini said. \"Now we are seeing the lowest home spread offering for the Eagles over the last couple of seasons.

    "body": "\n        With the latest DraftKings promo code, new users can take advantage of $300 in bonus bets and three free months of NBA League Pass. The Denver Broncos have won seven straight games despite having a below-average offense, scoring 23.5 points per game this season. The Broncos are third in scoring defense, allowing just 17.3 points per game, a key reason why they are tied for the best record in the AFC at 8-2. They'll have one of their toughest tests of the season on Sunday, playing the Kansas City Chiefs in a 4:25 p.m. ET start that should be one of the top games of the Week 11 NFL schedule. The SportsLine model is backing the Broncos to cover as 4.5-point underdogs as one of its Sunday best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook.The model also sees value in playing Under 48.5 points in Seahawks vs. Rams for Sunday best bets at DraftKings, despite both teams coming off high-scoring performances last week. Also, one of SportsLine's top experts has a best bet on an elite Sunday Night Football matchup of Lions vs. Eagles. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins, plus 3 months of NBA League Pass free: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times. Since its inception, it has generated a betting profit of over $2,000 for $100 players on its top-rated college spread football picks. Anybody following its college football betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Sunday best bets at DraftKings SportsbookSeahawks vs. Rams: Under 48.5 total pointsBroncos (+4.5) vs. ChiefsLions (+2.5) vs. EaglesCombining the model's three picks into a Sunday parlay at DraftKings would result in a payout of +596 (risk $100 to win $596). Bet it at DraftKings here:\nSeahawks vs. Rams: Under 48.5 total pointsPlaying an Under on two teams that combined to score 86 points, with each team scoring more than 40 points last week, may seem like an odd play, but the fact that those performances have raised this over/under to nearly 50 points has the model feeling like it's an overreaction. The Rams and Seahawks both have top-five scoring offenses, with Seattle ranking third and Los Angeles fifth, but they also each have top-five scoring defenses, including the Rams ranking second at 17 ppg allowed. Both teams have the personnel to slow down the other team and put pressure on pocket passers such as Matthew Stafford and Sam Darnold, which could lead to a lower point total than the sportsbooks are forecasting. The model projects the Under to hit in 62% of simulations. Back the Under at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Broncos (+4.5) vs. ChiefsYes, the Chiefs nearly always winning off a bye with Andy Reid as the head coach has a popular narrative this week. And although that is true (Kansas City is 9-3 in the regular season after a bye under Reid), this isn't the same Kansas City team as in recent seasons. The Chiefs are 5-4 this year, and they haven't lost more than four games over an entire season in five of their last seven seasons. The Bills defeated the Chiefs, 28-21, in Week 9 before Kansas City's bye week by putting pressure on Patrick Mahomes. The Broncos have arguably the best defensive line in the NFL, and they are capable of replicating Buffalo's success, which had Patrick Mahomes finishing with a completion percentage below 50% for the first time in his career. Projecting a strong defensive performance and the offense making enough plays, the model has the Broncos covering the spread in 58% of simulations. Back the Broncos at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Lions (+2.5) vs. Eagles\"The Eagles gutted out a tough win in Green Bay on Monday, but it was not an impressive showing by their offense, which managed eight or fewer yards in six of 10 offensive series,\" SportsLine NFL expert R.J. White said. \"The defense was very much bend-but-don't-break, with the Packers scoring once on six drives into Philly territory. This is a much tougher opponent, especially with Dan Campbell taking over playcalling duties on offense.

On the Seattle side, things have been humming with San Darnold at QB, with the big-play defense chipping in with two scores last week,\" legendary handicapper Bruce Marshall said. \"The Seahawks are scoring at a brisk 36 ppg clip the past three weeks, with Darnold just two weeks removed from tossing 4 TDP vs. the Commanders on November 2 in D.C. As for the Rams, they're scoring at a 37 pg pace the past three as QB Matthew Stafford (25 TD passes and only 2 picks thus far!) builds a nice MVP case.\" Back the Under at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Under 45 points in Broncos vs. Chiefs (-110)These two AFC West rivals haven't played each other in a game where they've combined for 40 point or more since 2023 and this could be another low-scoring battle with Denver ranking third in the NFL in scoring defense and Kansas City ranking fourth. Both teams have been inconsistent offensively this season and that's a trend the model predicts to continue. It has the Under hitting in 60% of simulations. Back the Under at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Lions +2.5 vs. Eagles (-118)\"The Eagles gutted out a tough win in Green Bay on Monday, but it was not an impressive showing by their offense, which managed eight or fewer yards in six of 10 offensive series.

White said. \"This is a much tougher opponent, especially with Dan Campbell taking over playcalling duties on offense. The Lions also have a D-line capable of neutralizing Philly's strength up front and limiting scoring once again.

Rozier specifically has been implicated for a 2023 game in which he pulled himself out early. Law enforcement claims more than $200,000 was wagered on his prop bet unders.With the sports world facing its largest gambling scandal since sports betting became legal in the U.S., the NFL sent out a memo to all 32 teams reminding executives, team presidents, general managers, coaches, players and NFL employees of the gambling policy. As for what is allowed, legally placing bets on other sports and non-football prediction markets is permitted, as long as it is not done on team property or when traveling with the team. Players can also participate in traditional fantasy football, as long as the prize money is $250 or less. \nHowever, they were instructed to not:Place any bet on NFL footballThrow or fix any NFL game or event, or otherwise manipulate or attempt to manipulate any play or other aspect of an NFL gameShare confidential, non-public information regarding any NFL game, player, or event with any third-partyPlayers were instructed to report if a third party attempts to solicit or inquire about non-public information regarding players or teams, or if a third party approaches a player about fixing the outcome of a game or player stats. Failing to do so will be considered a violation of the gambling policy, and subject to discipline. Players that place wagers on their own team's games will be suspended for a minimum two years.The NFL also stated that the league is, \"Monitoring player podcasts and investigating those that may be associated with or sponsored by any gambling entity.\"\nThe NFL has not suspended a player for gambling since 2023.\n            \n    ",

The rookie started the first five games of his career but missed the last two weeks with what was described as a \"family situation.\" He has not practiced this week and is reportedly set to miss at least one more game with the Chiefs set to host the Washington Commanders on \"Monday Night Football.\"Simmons, the No. 32 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, returned home to California prior to the Chiefs' Week 6 game and was ruled out on the availability report with a \"personal\" designation. Coach Andy Reid initially declined to comment on the situation but this week offered a positive update on his first-year offensive lineman.\"My update for you with Josh would just be, there's communication,\" Reid said. \"I'm not going to get into all of it. Everything's positive. It's not a negative situation. He's taking care of family.\"Simmons protects quarterback Patrick Mahomes' blind side, and in his absence, backup Jaylon Moore stepped into the lineup to handle the blocking duties in victories over the Detroit Lions and Las Vegas Raiders. When asked for comment on Simmons' situation, Mahomes said he would keep things behind closed doors.\n\"I'll keep conversations kind of between us,\" Mahomes said last week. \"But I'm always praying for him. I'm praying for all my teammates, so I'm always praying for him. I'll just keep everything else kind of private to us.\"The Chiefs are 2-0 without Simmons and won their last two games by at least two scores. They racked up 30 points against the Lions and 31 points against the Raiders.\nThis is the second time in as many seasons that Simmons missed extended time. He sat more than half of his final year at Ohio State after he suffered a season-ending knee injury, but he still played a key role in the Buckeyes' run to the national championship. Across his six games in the lineup, Simmons posted the lowest pressure rate (0.7%) of any tackle in the country with at least 100 pass-blocking snaps.\n            \n    ",

It's safe to say that San Francisco has been heavily impacted by the injury bug in 2025. Brock Purdy, Brandon Aiyuk, Fred Warner, and Ricky Pearsall are just some of the 49ers that are currently sidelined. Still, San Francisco has managed to produce a 5-2 record. The 49ers came away with a hard-fought 20-10 win against the Atlanta Falcons in Week 7.Meanwhile, the Texans haven't been as fortunate to begin the 2025 campaign. Houston has started 2-4 and is fresh off a 27-19 loss at the hands of the Seattle Seahawks. To make matters worse, the Texans could be without star wide receiver Nico Collins, who suffered a concussion against the Seahawks.Click here to bet 49ers vs. Texans at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:\nWhere to watch 49ers vs. Texans liveDate: Sunday, Oct. 26 | Time: 1 p.m. ETWhere: NRG Stadium -- Houston, TexasTV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Texans -1.5; O/U 41.5 (via FanDuel)49ers vs. Texans: Need to knowSan Francisco must keep feeding McCaffrey. The 49ers definitely missed star running back Christian McCaffrey during last season as he was limited to just four games due to injury. Entering Week 8, McCaffrey has paced San Francisco's offense and leads the NFL with 981 scrimmage yards. While his 3.5 yards per carry isn't lighting the world on fire, he's continued to be an offensive weapon when it comes to catching the ball out of the backfield. Considering that the 49ers are shorthanded at wide receiver, getting the ball in McCaffrey's hands will be essential to the team's success.Jones to remain under center.  Purdy has been dealing with a toe injury that has sidelined the 49ers starting quarterback for five games. Mac Jones hasn't been flashy, but has played well in relief of Purdy up to this point. The former first-round pick is completing 67.0% of his passes for 1,404 yards to go along with six touchdowns. Jones isn't a flashy signal caller, but has managed to lead San Francisco to four wins across his five starts.Texans could be shorthanded at wide receiver. Entering the season, the Texans were already at a disadvantage at the wide receiver position after losing Tank Dell to an awful knee injury in 2024. Veteran receiver Christian Kirk has been limited to just three games this season as he deals with a nagging hamstring injury. Kirk is currently being listed as questionable Sunday's contest as is the status of star wideout Nico Collins. Collins suffered a concussion during the fourth quarter of Monday's game against the Seahawks, so he'd have to complete all the protocols before being medically cleared to suit up. If Collins and Kirk are sidelined, Xavier Hutchinson, rookie Jaylin Noel, and Dalton Schultz will likely see increased targets against San Francisco.49ers vs. Texans pick, prediction\nThis has the potential to be one of the more lower-scoring games of Week 8. It's no secret that the 49ers are extremely banged up on both sides of the ball, but still have the potential to pull off the narrow upset on the road. Jones continues to excel filling in for Purdy and the offense will do just enough to win. Pick: 49ers +1.5, Under 41.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        FRISCO, Texas -- The kicker position typically isn't the most exciting one to watch in football, but Dallas Cowboys All-Pro Brandon Aubrey is the exception.For those who tune in weekly, it can sometimes feel like Aubrey is threatening -- or outright setting -- some kind of NFL kicking record every game. He did just that in Dallas' 44-22 win over the Washington Commanders in Week 7, drilling a 61-yard field goal that marked his fifth career make from 60 yards or beyond, the most in league history.\"Hopefully that's just the start,\" Aubrey told CBS Sports on Friday. \"Hopefully we can hold on to the record. Guys are getting better and better. I don't think five is going to hold it for long.\"Aubrey's growing list of milestones includes:An NFL-record 35 consecutive field goals to begin a career.A league-record 14 made field goals from 50 yards or longer in 2024, the most ever in a single season.The longest field goal in Cowboys history, a 65-yarder in Week 3 last season against the Ravens -- the second-longest in NFL history.Five career makes from 60 yards or more, the most all-time.One record, however, remains just out of reach: the longest field goal in NFL history. That mark belongs to former Ravens kicker Justin Tucker, who hit a 66-yard game-winner to beat the Lions, 19-17, in Week 3 of the 2021 season.\nAubrey might have his best shot yet at topping that number this Sunday, when the Cowboys visit the Denver Broncos. Empower Field at Mile High sits 5,280 feet above sea level, and three of the eight longest outdoor field goals in league history have been kicked there, per CBS Sports' John Breech: Jason Elam's 63-yarder (1998), Sebastian Janikowski's 63-yarder (2011) and Matt Prater's 64-yarder (2013).Cowboys head coach Brian Schottenheimer echoed the NFL's official X (formerly Twitter) account in praising Aubrey's 61-yarder last week, specifically the \"ease\" with which it was struck.\"We'll see how he practices. I don't know yet. He might not be very good. I don't know?\" Schottenheimer said sarcastically on Monday when asked about Aubrey kicking in the altitude. \"I think he'll probably be pretty good. ... I showed the team the 61-yard field goal today -- and I'm not a kicking expert -- but what amazes me is the ease in just the way the operation goes. ... Altitude might make it interesting.\"\nThe ease Schottenheimer referenced isn't just a matter of opinion. Cowboys two-time Pro Bowl punter Bryan Anger, who also serves as Aubrey's holder, said Friday that when factoring in how high -- or how deep into the net -- Aubrey's made kicks travel, several have effectively cleared the uprights from more than 70 yards out.\"His makes have been at 71, 72 distance carry,\" Anger told CBS Sports. \"I think that it's there just doing the same thing that he's been doing and not trying [purposefully] at a longer distance because they are traveling longer.\"  Dallas actually had a chance to let Aubrey attempt a 67-yarder during last week's win over Washington. Facing fourth-and-11 from the Commanders' 49-yard line with a 34-15 lead and 6:57 remaining, Schottenheimer chose to punt. But that decision doesn't mean he'd make the same call Sunday in Denver.\nHe explained that not attempting the long kick in Week 7 was about game situation -- with the Cowboys' defense dominating and Washington quarterback Jayden Daniels out with a hamstring injury.\"Can Brandon make that kick? Of course he can. Did we talk about it? We did, but at the end of the day, I felt again with the time in the game, the way the game was kind of going we felt that was the right one.\"Brandon Aubrey career (NFL ranks)NFL ranks since 2023FGs911stFG attempts1001stFG %91%4th*50-plus-yard FGs291st60-plus-yard FGs51st* among 24 kickers with at least 60 field goal attempts since 2023The confidence is certainly there to trot Aubrey out in Mile High for a 67-yarder or deeper. Schottenheimer celebrated the All-Pro kicker in front of the entire team this week, awarding him one of several game balls handed out for standout Week 7 performances.\"I want to celebrate our guys when they do cool, cool, cool shit. The record is amazing -- most 60-yard field goals. I asked him, 'How many years you got in the league?' He said, 'Two and a half.' I said, 'Oh yeah, you're an old man.' But he's going to have plenty of time to break records. If it happens in Denver this week, great. If it doesn't, I'm quite sure he'll own that record at some point.\"Despite kicking in altitude and outdoors this week, Aubrey said he isn't altering his pregame process -- which centers on trial and error and finding his comfort level that day. Together with Anger and long snapper Trent Sieg during warmups, he establishes the longest distance he thinks he can make a field goal and then relays that to special teams coordinator Nick Sorensen and Schottenheimer. That number can shift slightly depending on adrenaline and game flow.\"Nothing changes, just go see what it looks like in warmups, go report a line to the coaching staff of where we're comfortable kicking from, and then from there, make the kicks they give me,\" Aubrey said. \"The line is more reflected on the play caller's decision. Whether they're comfortable turning the ball over from there because if I miss, they get the ball from their own side of the field. Wherever they're comfortable ... is the biggest thing.\"Brandon Aubrey NFL kicking career by stadium typeIndoors/Retractable RoofOutdoorsMade FGs/attempts58/59 (98.3%)33/41 (80.5%)Made FGs/attempts, 50-59 yards  19/19 (100%)10/13 (76.9%)Made FGs/attempts, 60-plus yards  4/4 (100%)1/3 (33.3%)Ironically, Aubrey's pursuit of the NFL's longest made field goal record comes without him ever actually practicing from that distance. He typically caps his practice range at 58 or 59 yards, occasionally testing a 60-yarder. His daily regimen starts with short extra points from both hashes, and then Aubrey turns over the decision-making for his practice kick locations over to Anger and Sieg, trusting his guys to give him enough variety to get him ready for Sundays. \"You hit a ball from 59, you can just look at it and watch it and see, 'OK, it hit the net halfway up -- it's got another six, seven yards,'\" Aubrey said. \"So you don't have to go back there and hammer a ball from 65 to tell yourself or make an example that you're good from that distance.\"If Aubrey simply replicates the same smooth operation from Week 7 -- when he drilled a 61-yarder -- he could easily have the leg for 67 yards, which would set a new NFL record.\"Yeah, yes,\" Aubrey said when asked about that line of thinking. \"Mmmhmm.\"\n            ",

The Patriots are on a four-game win streak and the Browns got a win last week against the Dolphins to end their three-game losing streak. Cleveland currently sits at 2-5, while the Patriots are 5-2.The Patriots are one of the top teams in the AFC right now and have already passed their win total from the 2024 season. Drake Maye is looking like the real deal and the team is getting attention under Mike Vrabel, who is in his first season coaching his old team.The Browns dealt with their share of drama in the offseason, with multiple quarterbacks to choose from. Their Week 1 starter Joe Flacco is now on the Cincinnati Bengals and it's 2025 third-round pick Dillon Gabriel who the team is moving forward with.\nWhere to watch Patriots vs. Browns liveDate: Sunday, Oct. 26 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: Gillette Stadium -- Foxboro, MassachusettsTV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Patriots -7; O/U 40.5 (via DraftKings)    Patriots vs. Browns: Need to knowDrake Maye is breaking records. Maye is only in year two and is already breaking some records previously set by Tom Brady. Not bad company for the sophomore quarterback. Last week against the Titans, Maye had a 91.3% completion rate which broke Brady's best single-game record (and franchise record) of 88.5. Maye is also the first player in NFL history to record 4,000 passing yards and 500 rushing yards with at least a 69% completion percentage in the first 20 games of their career. The Browns defense will be a tougher challenge. While many are praising the Patriots success this year, others have said New England has yet to face a real challenge, particularly a team with a solid defense, which is something that the Browns have. Cleveland is struggling to rack up wins but its defense has been a bright spot this season. This will be one of the tougher defenses the Patriots have faced this season and it's a chance for New England's offense to prove itself against a capable squad or show the holes the team has. The Patriots' challenge this week will be to not go back to what they were doing earlier in the season when they were turning over the football.Protect Dillon Gabriel. The Browns quarterback had his best game last week, granted it was against a struggling Dolphins team, but is still a confidence booster for the first-year player. Gabriel hasn't turned the ball over this season, but opposing defenses are getting pressure on him. In total the Browns have allowed 19 sacks on their quarterback this season, including 10 on Gabriel. Protecting the young QB will be crucial.Patriots vs. Browns prediction, pick\nI think the Patriots will continue their winning streak alive, but the Browns defense will put up a good fight. I think Gabriel will see his first pick this week. Pick: Patriots -7; Over 40.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        The cliché unstoppable force vs. the immoveable object is used often in sports, but in Week 8 with the high-flying Dallas Cowboys (3-3-1) offense heading into Denver to face a stout Broncos (5-2) defense, it's appropriate to use regarding this matchup. Dallas' trio of quarterback Dak Prescott (1,881 yards passing, second-most in the NFL), running back Javonte Williams (592 yards rushing, second-most in the NFL) and wide receiver George Pickens (607 yards receiving, fourth-most in the NFL) are the only teammate trio in the NFL this season to rank top five in the league in passing, rushing and receiving. The Cowboys have seen one teammate trio do that over the course of an entire NFL season since the 1970 AFL/NFL merger: the Hall of Fame trio of quarterback Troy Aikman, running back Emmitt Smith and wide receiver Michael Irvin in 1992. That was when that core won their first Super Bowl title. That's also on top of All-Pro receiver CeeDee Lamb returning in Week 7 from a three-game absence because of a sprained ankle. He racked up 110 yards and a touchdown on five catches against the Washington Commanders last week. Tight end Jake Ferguson also ranks fourth in the NFL in catches (51) and tied for second in the league in touchdown catches (6) with Pickens and Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Davante Adams. On the other side of the ball, Denver's pass rush is the NFL's best: they lead the league in both sacks (34) and quarterback pressure rate (44.9%). Two Broncos edge rushers, Nik Bonitto (eight sacks, third-most in the NFL) and Jonathon Cooper (six sacks this season, tied for the fourth-most in the NFL), rank top five in the NFL in sacks. The Broncos' two cornerbacks are also standouts: Patrick Surtain II is the reigning NFL Defensive Player of the Year, and Riley Moss's 37.5% completion percentage allowed is the lowest among 76 defenders with at least 30 passes thrown their way this season.   \nPrescott will be making just his second trip to Denver to face the Broncos despite being Dallas' starting quarterback for 10 seasons (since 2016). His sole past trip came in Week 2 of the 2017, his second NFL season, and much of Denver's defense from its Super Bowl 50 core -- edge rusher Von Miller and cornerbacks Aqib Talib and Chris Harris -- knocked Prescott and Dallas around in a 42-17 Broncos' home win. Denver's current crew evokes memories of the Broncos' defense of old for Prescott. \"Yeah, I named some of those older guys, but Bonitto and Surtain, right, they're just a [fair] comparison as some of those guys that I played back then. So credit and respect to them. ... Obviously, they know that they go hand in hand for them,\" Prescott said Thursday. \"Corners can be a little bit more aggressive, sit a little bit more, play those routes, knowing that they're getting home on defense with just their rush. Leading the league in sacks, right. Dominating on third down. So a lot of credit or a lot of respect for them. Just continue to go in there and play my game. Starts with beating the pass rush and when you got the receivers I do, having confidence in them to win. ... Just know going into the game and the game plan... you might not get to [read] No. 4. Sometimes you might not get to [read] No. 3 right? So it's important for the receivers to understand how aggressive they have to be and understanding the time clock. We'll be fine.\"Both sides are buckling up for a heavyweight clash between two of the best units in football come Sunday afternoon at Mile High. \n\"It's what you play the game for. Regardless if we were both first or not, it's what you play the game for -- elite competition,\" Prescott said. ... \"An amazing environment where the fans are going to be loud, our communication is going to be tested, the non-verbal part of it. Yeah, super excited. It'll be a great one.\"Cowboys offense vs. Broncos defense NFL Ranks, 2025 seasonDAL OffenseNFL RankDEN DefenseNFL RankPPG31.72nd18.14thTotal YPG380.31st273.13rdYards/Play6.12nd4.52ndRush YPG122.114th93.39thPass YPG268.32nd179.96th3rd Down Conversion Rate44%7th29.2%1stQB Pressure Rate33.3%7th44.9%1stSacks8T-2nd341stCompletion Percentage71.2%3rd55.9%1stPass TD16T-2nd7T-2ndPasser Rating105.77th82.85thWhere to watch Cowboys vs. Broncos liveWhen: Sunday, Oct. 26 | Time: 4:25 p.m. ETWhere: Empower Field at Mile High (Denver)TV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+ (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Broncos -3.5; O/U 51 (via FanDuel Sportsbook)Cowboys vs. Broncos: Need to knowHow will Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott, head coach Brian Schottenheimer manage the passing game vs. Broncos' No. 1 pass rush?Despite knowing Prescott won't have as much time to survey the field on Sunday, that doesn't mean Schottenheimer will change his aggression level as a play caller when it comes to dialing deep shots to Pickens and Lamb. The Cowboys are excited to face the Broncos' man coverage-heavy defense: Denver plays man coverage at the fourth-highest rate in the NFL (36.3%).\"I don't think so because again what they do, which is smart because of their pass rush, they like to play a lot of press man to man,\" Schottenheimer said when asked if Denver's pass rush changes his downfield aggression. \"We'll see what they do with Patrick [Surtain] and who they match him on, if they match him at all. I think they will, but we'll see. They want to rush the passer, they want to disrupt the timing. I'm quite certain they're going to be very comfortable. They do it against Cincinnati and teams like that that have unique weapons like we do. It will be a fun matchup to watch.\"Williams, who played his first four seasons with the Broncos after being selected in the second-round of the 2021 NFL Draft, will also factor into slowing down Denver's pass rush. The NFL's second-leading rusher has been looking forward to the homecoming against his former team.\"They're making it all grimy. I mean we got to go into this game expecting them to do just that, win dirty,\" Prescott said. \"No matter what it takes and whatever we have to do, run into some tight boxes, right, but we got to make our plays outside when they give us one-on-one and put ourselves in some of those third and manageables, short of the third and seven and we'll have the upper hand.\"Will Cowboys defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus go back to running his heavy zone scheme vs. Broncos QB Bo Nix? Former Cowboys defensive coordinator Dan Quinn helped mold Dallas into a top five defense built on generating quarterback pressure and takeaways while running man coverage on 33.8% of their defensive plays from 2021 to 2023, the third-highest rate in the NFL in that time frame. After Dallas ranked 31st in scoring defense (30.7 points per game allowed) and last in the entire NFL in total defense (411.7 total yards allowed) through the first six weeks while running zone coverage on a league-high 87.2% of defensive snaps in 2025, new defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus altered his approach. Dallas ran man coverage at a season-high 46.9% rate in Week 7, per TruMedia, against Quinn's Washington Commanders, and Dallas' defense had their best performance under Eberflus in a 44-22 Week 7 victory. That 46.9% man coverage rate was the highest in the NFL in Week 7. How stark of a shift did Eberflus make with his defense? Dallas' next highest man coverage rate of the season was 14.1% in Week 5 at the New York Jets, a 37-22 Cowboys road win. \"Yeah, each week's different. Let's be honest, we played good defense yesterday. They had a few guys out, I don't feel bad for them. We've had a lot of guys out. But we're not sitting here saying, 'Hey we're ready. We're it.' We're not saying we're it right now in any phase,\" Schottenheimer said on Monday. \"But we're going to keep working hard, and we put together a great plan, the guys executed that plan. The guys practiced well. It showed up throughout the week and, man, the communication, I just can't say enough about that.\" Eberflus didn't just get more aggressive with his coverage, he also did so with his utilization of the blitz: the Cowboys' 42.5% blitz rate in Week 7, the eighth-highest blitz rate in the league last week, is their highest of the year by a sizeable margin. The next closest blitz rate Eberflus called was back in Week 3 against his former employer, the Chicago Bears, in Week 3: 28.6%. Naturally, the Cowboys racked up four sacks vs. Washington  by four different players -- linebacker Kenneth Murray, linebacker Shemar James, edge rusher Jadeveon Clowney and edge rusher Donovan Ezeiruaku -- for their second-best sack production of 2025 trailing just their five of New York Jets quarterback Justin Fields in a 37-22 Week 5 road win. Entering Week 7, Dallas had blitzed on just 22.4% of opponents' dropbacks, the seventh-lowest rate in the league. Looking ahead to Week 8, no team has had more plays with a screen thrown than the Broncos' 47 in 2025. Despite Cowboys' players and fans' complaints, Dallas may go back to playing more zone coverage in Week 8 because of Denver quarterback Bo Nix's strengths and weaknesses. He is 10th in the NFL in yards per dropback against man coverage (7.0) and 24th in the league in yards per dropback vs. zone (5.8). \"You have to watch the tape. Analytics tells you something, but the tape tells you the truth. So we have to really understand that the tape tells us what's going on, but I like to get the analytics first to look at it, to see where it is and then really get the evidence off the tape,\" Eberflus said Thursday. \"Then you see how you can move your defense to fit what they're doing on offense, and then it's really just about the guys executing. ... It's [analytics] a starting point.\"Prediction\nNew York Giants rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart was able to rack up four total touchdowns (three passing and one rushing) and 294 total yards (283 passing and 11 rushing) against Denver's vaunted defense at Mile High last week. After New York highlighted some soft spots in the Broncos' stout defensive unit in Week 7, Prescott, a 10-year veteran playing MVP-caliber ball, will be able to make more plays than the up-and-down, second-year Denver quarterback in Nix. A long field goal by All-Pro kicker Brandon Aubrey makes the difference in a narrow Cowboys victory.Pick: Cowboys 27, Broncos 24 | Cowboys +3.5\n            ",

If he were on the list, Vesia could be activated later in the World Series. As it is, he can be added only to replace an injured player.\"We just didn't want to have any potential for any kind of pressure,\" Friedman said Friday before Game 1. \"This is so much bigger than baseball. For us, it was doing whatever small part we could to just a hundred percent be supportive.Here is the club's Thursday statement in full: \"It's with a heavy heart that we share that Alex Vesia is away from the team as he and his wife Kayla navigate a deeply personal family matter.

Raman joins the Storm after a coaching career that spans across the collegiate and professional ranks and in both the WNBA and NBA.Prior to her lone season with the Liberty this year, Raman was an assistant for the NBA's Memphis Grizzlies from 2020 to 2024. Before making the jump to the professional ranks, she was the head coach of MIT women's basketball team for 12 years between 2008 and 2020. During her tenure, she led the team to its first two conference championships and two NCAA Tournament appearances at the Division III level. Before that, she was the lead assistant at Wellesley College for six seasons, and began her coaching career at her alma mater of Tufts University.Raman comes with a wealth of coaching experience at a variety of levels, and becomes the first person of Indian-origin to become a head coach in the WNBA. Raman also interviewed for the Liberty's head coaching vacancy, according to The Athletic's Ben Pickman, after the team parted ways with Sandy Brondello following a first-round playoff exit to the Phoenix Mercury. Ultimately, though, she lands the lead job with the Storm where she'll look to aid in the development of Dominique Malonga, who earned All-Rookie honors this past season.Raman takes over after the Storm parted ways with Noelle Quinn in September following a first-round playoff exit. Quinn spent seven seasons with the Storm, two of which were as an assistant before being elevated to head coach in 2021. She led the team to four playoff appearances in her five seasons in charge, but in the last two years could not make it out of the first round. Following the end of the 2024 season, Quinn and her coaching staff were investigated for alleged mistreatment of players that included bullying and harassment. Quinn and her staff were cleared of any wrongdoing, but Jewell Loyd requested a trade from the team, who then became a vital piece of the Las Vegas Aces' title run this year.\nFollowing the early playoff exit, the Storm face an offseason with several questions to answer. Only two players are under contract for next season, and with Malonga expected to be the future face of the franchise, the Storm have to figure out how they want to approach next season.\n            \n    ",

In his last fight, Delgado knocked out a fighter with great durability in under 30 seconds. Standing 5-foot-11 with a 73-inch reach, Delgado is big for the weight class and will have a considerable size advantage. Wood is a tactical kickboxer with strong UFC experience, and he will provide a step-up in competition for Delgado. However, I don't think he'll be able to outpoint Delgado for three rounds.

    "body": "\n        The arrests of Chauncey Billups and Terry Rozier in the federal investigation into sports betting and illegal gambling called into question how the NBA is working to protect its players from the dark side of the wagering world. And according to Boston Celtics forward Jaylen Brown, the league has not done enough in that regard.Brown, who serves as a vice president of the National Basketball Players Association, lamented the lack of discourse between the league and its athletes about staying safe in the era of legalized sports betting. Whether it be the dangers of soliciting information to bettors or fans' regrettable behavior towards players, Brown said there is ample work to be done in keeping players out of harm's way.\"A lot more could have been done to help players and prepare players,\" Brown said in his Friday pregame media availability. \"But even in the aftermath, I don't think little care or attention to detail goes into it. They're like, 'You make X amount of money or X, Y and Z, you should be able to deal with all the extra negativity, people approaching you about parlays. It creates a negative discourse around the game and players when people have money involved.\"Complicating matters is that the NBA has business partnerships with sportsbooks, which produce immense revenue from wagers made on the league's games, teams and individual players. Commissioner Adam Silver called this week for stricter regulations on sports betting and said the NBA asked some of its partners to pull back on some of their player prop bet offerings in an attempt to prevent game manipulation.\"I don't think once from my conversations with the union and the NBA has been like 'How can we protect players more with the environment?'\" Brown said. \"There's been little to no conversation about that. It's all about 'How can we increase business and increase revenue?' I'm not sure if we're having enough conversations about the aftermath or the consequences some of that stuff has.\"\nBillups and Rozier were among the more than 30 people arrested by the FBI as part of the investigation. Billups was allegedly connected with illegal high-stakes poker games, and Rozier was allegedly tied to a ring of current and former NBA players trading inside information with bettors.\"That whole world was introduced a couple of years ago, and I don't think they took players into consideration, especially with the energy and the behavior that goes around gambling and how that directly correlates with players,\" Brown said. \"We don't benefit from any of the profits or anything like that, but we gotta deal with a lot of the extra negativity and scrutiny behind all the gambling stuff. On top of that, it creates more integrity issues, et cetera. I'm not sure what the answer is going forward, but definitely something that people gotta spend more time having conversations about.\"This is the NBA's second major gambling scandal in the last two years. The league banned Jontay Porter in 2024 for his role in a scheme involving his prop bets.\n\"Protecting the safety of players and coaches has always been of critical importance,\" NBA spokesman Mike Bass said in a statement. \"League security works with team officials and law enforcement to respond to any type of fan behavior that violates our code of conduct -- whether that's in our arenas or online.  We have put safeguards in place, including social media monitoring, to track and mitigate any potential threats or safety risks. And we have increased communications to fans attending games to reinforce our code of conduct and emphasize that disrespectful and abusive behavior will not be tolerated.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Inter Miami have opened the MLS Cup Playoffs with a 3-1 victory over Nashville SC behind a rarity from Lionel Messi. The Argentine number 10 has now scored 891 goals in his career, but only 29 of those have come with his head. After Inter Miami weathered the storm of Nashville's start to the game, Luis Suarez found Messi with a pass over the top, which he finished off with not just a header but a diving header to get past Joe Willis for the lead. Suarez may have taken a step back scoring-wise from last season, where he scored 20 goals, but his movement has still been critical for Miami to create chances, and it showed in this one. Here's the goal:\nMiami were able to ride that goal to a halftime lead, which put them 45 minutes closer to defeating Nashville SC in this best-of-three series, and Tadeo Allende added the insurance goal from a Messi assist to put them ahead. Messi would also add another goal to complete his brace deep into stoppage time for the final advantage.Game two will take place in Nashville on Saturday, Nov. 1, with the first team to get to two wins advancing to the next round. If a game three is needed in this best-of-three series, then things will return to Fort Lauderdale.\nAfter facing Miami on the final day of the MLS regular season, losing 5-2, the Herons had B.J. Callaghan's team's number yet again. Nashville are now winless in three straight matches and will face elimination in that match next Saturday at GEODIS Park. Where worry will set in isn't that Miami won, but more on how they won. Sam Surridge and Hany Mukhtar were well contained during the match by Sergio Busquets and Rodrigo De Paul, keeping Nashville's attack at bay. Miami's defense kept Surridge with fewer than 15 touches during the match, leaving Nashville searching for answers. It's something that Callaghan will need to adjust in the next match between the two.\nAfter being knocked out of the playoffs in the first round by Atlanta United last season, this is a strong start to putting that behind them. Messi will be key in anything now, having scored 39 goals in all competitions en route to a likely league MVP award. The one thing missing from Miami's season is a knockout tournament victory after falling in the Concacaf Champions Cup and the Leagues Cup, and closing out this match will put them closer to making this season a success. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Kansas star Darryn Peterson returned to the lineup on Saturday for the first time in nearly a month and had his best showing of the 2025-26 season. Peterson, who is the No. 1-ranked NBA Draft prospect in the CBS Sports rankings, finished with 26 points, six rebounds and one assist in the No. 17 Jayhawks' 81-75 loss to UCF.Peterson scored 23 of his game-high 26 points in the first half. However, the Kansas star logged just five minutes in the second half and scored three points. Peterson subbed out with 10:55 remaining in regulation and did not return.The former top-ranked player had previously only played in four games before returning for the Jayhawks' Big 12 opener. His last appearance came on Dec. 13 against NC State, when he exited the game late and did not return due to a hamstring injury. \n        \n            \n                Kentucky's good vibes erode as No. 14 Alabama wins fourth straight vs. Wildcats\n                \n                    Isaac Trotter                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThat latest setback saw him miss games against Towson and Davidson. In total, Peterson has missed nine games this season.\nPeterson got off to a hot start in the first half against UCF. He scored 11 points in the first six minutes and finished with 23 points before halftime. His previous season-high came against North Carolina, when he finished with 22 points in his second collegiate game.Recapping Peterson's season so farAs stated earlier, this weekend marked Peterson's fifth game of the season. He appeared in games against Green Bay and North Carolina in November before missing a month with a hamstring injury. Peterson returned to the lineup last month against Missouri and finished with 17 points in 23 minutes of action.However, in Peterson's next game against NC State, he appeared to re-aggregate the injury that caused him to miss a month. He subbed out of the game twice down the stretch against NC State but ultimately didn't return. Even with Peterson out of the lineup, the Jayhawks were able to escape with a dramatic 77-76 win in overtime behind a career day from Melvin Council Jr.\nAfter Kansas' final nonconference game against Davidson last month, coach Bill Self addressed Peterson's absence, stating that it was a mutual agreement between the program and his family to hold the prized freshman out of the lineup until he was at full strength. Even in his return against UCF, Peterson logged just 22 minutes.Peterson has only played over 30 minutes once this season. That came against NC State when he finished with 31 minutes.Why Peterson is regarded as a top draft prospectIt's no secret that this freshman class has a chance to be an all-timer. Even with the NBA Draft over six months away, there isn't a definite candidate to go No. 1 overall. That pick will likely come down to Peterson, BYU's AJ Dybantsa and Duke's Cameron Boozer.\nThis performance by Peterson was key to his draft stock. For starters, Boozer has been playing like the best player in the country and should be the favorite (if the season ended today) to win player of the year honors. As for Dybantsa, he has also been playing like one of the best players in the country over the last month.Peterson's calling card is his ability to get a bucket whenever it's needed. However, the No. 1 pick in the NBA Draft has traditionally featured bigs or wings being taken. Peterson has the chance to be the exception.\nThe last guard taken with the No. 1 pick was Cade Cunningham in 2021. Since 2010, only six prospects who have gone No. 1 have been classified as a guard. Although Cooper Flagg was utilized as a point guard through the first few weeks of his NBA career by the Dallas Mavericks, he is a traditional wing at the NBA level.\nPart of the intrigue around Peterson is his potential to be a volume scorer at the NBA level. Peterson is also a talented defensive prospect who can defend at a high level because of his size and athleticism. But what stands out the most -- and why he may ultimately go No. 1 -- is his shot-making that is second to none in this class. That was on display against UCF.The best version of Kansas will revolve around Peterson staying on the floor. If the Jayhawks can get the first-half version of Peterson down the stretch, it would change the whole dynamic of their season. However, if Peterson is limited like he was in the second half, the ceiling of what Kansas can accomplish in March will be significantly lower.\n            ",

The deal is for four years and $60 million, according to the New York Post. Okamoto, 29, has spent the first 11 years of his professional career with Tokyo's Yomiuri Giants in Nippon Professional Baseball, the top league in Japan. Okamoto's posting window was set to close at 5 p.m. ET Sunday afternoon. In NPB, Okamoto was a six-time All-Star and led his league in home runs three times. Last season was injury-shortened. In his 69 games, he hit .327/.416/.598 with 15 home runs and 49 RBI. He has six 30+ home run seasons with a career high of 41 in 2023. He's a career .274/.355/.501 hitter in NPB. Coming off the heels of their first AL pennant since 1993, the Blue Jays have been aggressive this offseason. They added starting pitchers Dylan Cease and Cody Ponce in addition to reliever Tyler Rogers. Okamoto is their first major signing on the position player side. \nIf the Jays indeed intend to keep Okamoto at third base, this move could close the door on free agent Bo Bichette, though it's far from a certainty. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. is obviously at first base, Okamoto slots at third and that leaves Andrés Giménez for shortstop with Ernie Clement at second. Addison Barger can also play third base. Then again, it's possible the Jays still bring Bichette back to play shortstop and put Giménez in a backup middle infielder role. The Blue Jays have also been mentioned as suitors for free agent outfielder Kyle Tucker. If George Springer sticks at designated hitter, the outfield options are Nathan Lukas, Daulton Varsho, Anthony Santander, Barger and Davis Schneider. Schneider can also handle second base. What stands out more than anything is that the Blue Jays have plenty of depth and versatility. This puts them in a position where if they decide to spring for Bichette and/or Tucker, it's a nice help for the ballclub, but by no means is either player out of necessity. \nFor now, slot Okamoto as the Blue Jays' everyday third baseman and figure that he bats somewhere 5-7 in the order. \n            \n    ",

Brock Purdy and the offense are rolling along, helping make up for a defense that is decimated by injuries. The Niners should be getting George Kittle back in the lineup for this game, so they'll at least be back to full strength on offense.Seattle enters the game as the top seed in the NFC and having also won six straight. The Seahawks are powered by their elite defense, which smothered the Carolina Panthers last week during the team's latest win. The Seahawks knew coming into that contest that if they won out, they got the top seed in the conference, and the same remains true -- as it does for the 49ers.\n        \n            \n                Brock Purdy has traded game managing for dancing -- and the 49ers' Super Bowl window is wide open\n                \n                    Douglas Clawson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhich of these two teams will claim the NFC West and the No. 1 seed in the NFC? We'll find out soon enough. But before we break down some key storylines, here's a look at how you can watch the game.Where to watch 49ers vs. Seahawks liveDate: Saturday, Jan. 3 | Time: 8 p.m. ETLocation: Levi's Stadium (Santa Clara, California)TV: ABC/ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free) Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Seahawks -1.5, O/U 47.5 via DraftKings Sportsbook\nKey storylinesPlayoff picture. It's been talked about ad nauseam at this point, but it's still worth noting: The winner of this game wins both the NFC West and the No. 1 seed in the NFC, along with the first-round bye that comes with said slot. If the Seahawks win, the 49ers can actually drop as low as the No. 6 seed if the Rams beat the Cardinals. But if the Niners win, then the Seahawks will be the No. 5 seed and the Rams will be in the 6 spot.49ers offense. San Francisco's offense is on fire during its six-game winning streak, and especially across the three games since it returned from a Week 14 bye. Against the Titans, Colts and Bears, the Niners put up at least 430 yards, 28 first downs and 37 points in each game. They've averaged 455 yards, 29.3 first downs and 42.3 points per week during those contests. They struggled relative to that explosiveness in the first matchup against the Seahawks, though they did still put up 384 yards and 24 first downs, albeit while scoring only 17 points because they turned the ball over twice. Sam Darnold's turnovers. Darnold leads the NFL in giveaways this season, having thrown 14 interceptions and fumbled 10 times, losing six of them. He's turned it over at least once in four of the last five games, and twice in each of the last two. The Niners have had to rely on takeaways in recent weeks, forcing two or more in four of the six games during their six-game winning streak. If Darnold can't take care of the ball, that's a very bad sign for the Seattle offense.CMC's quests. There have only been four seasons in NFL history where a player has run for over 1,000 yards and caught at least 100 passes. Christian McCaffrey is responsible for two of those seasons, having accomplished the feat in both 2018 and 2019. He can do it again if he catches at least four passes on Sunday. McCaffrey is also 110 receiving yards away from a second career 1,000-1,000 season. That's only been done three times in history. The 110 receiving yards part seems pretty unlikely, but four catches is well within the realm of possibility.Prediction\nSan Francisco won this game early in the season, and that was before the Niners got on the roll they are on right now, where the offense is firing on all cylinders. Couple that with the fact that the Seattle offense hasn't been nearly as efficient or explosive as of late as it was earlier in the year, and I find it hard to believe that the Seahawks are going to go into Santa Clara and come away with the victory. Especially if George Kittle is good to go, I like the 49ers -- even though their defense probably lets Seattle's offense also get back on track.  \nPrediction: 49ers 30, Seahawks 27\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Ole Miss might lose most of its LSU-bound coaches to former coach Lane Kiffin this week, but it will keep at least one critical piece of the offensive staff in place as the Rebels prepare for the semifinals of the College Football Playoff.Offensive coordinator Charlie Weis Jr. is in Oxford and will continue leading the Rebels' offensive unit through at least this week's semifinals game, head coach Pete Golding confirmed Saturday. Weis Jr. is set to take over as LSU's OC whenever the time comes. Several position coaches, however, are expected to remain at LSU after coaching the Rebels to a thrilling 39-34 victory against Georgia in the quarterfinals on New Year's Day, sources told CBS Sports.Running backs coach Kevin Smith will not return to Oxford this week, 247Sports' Chase Parham first reported Saturday. Tight ends coach Joe Cox, receivers coach George McDonald, analyst Dan Stevens (quarterbacks) and graduate assistant Sawyer Jordan (slot receivers) are also in flux and are not expected as of Saturday to return to Ole Miss, sources told CBS Sports. They remained in Baton Rouge, helping with recruiting visitors after the transfer portal opened Friday.\nGolding, who was elevated from defensive coordinator to head coach when Kiffin bolted for LSU, did not confirm the status of the position coaches, but said he has been in \"constant\" communication with LSU and Kiffin about the staffing situation. Kiffin echoed those words in a statement to ESPN on Friday.\"They have every opportunity like they have up to this point to be able to make that decision,\" Golding said Saturday. \"So, week in and week out, I don't dictate whether they do that or not because they're not employed by me. Up to this point, that is how it's been and that's my expectation.\"Questions about Ole Miss' staff have lingered over the program since Kiffin left the program to take over at LSU on Dec. 1. He hired eight staffers from Ole Miss to his LSU staff. However, many remained in Oxford through the first two rounds of the playoff -- a 41-10 win against Tulane and the aforementioned thriller against Georgia.\nComplicating matters is the football calendar. The transfer portal opened Jan. 1 and will remain open until Jan. 16, and both schools were expected to host players for visits this weekend.FBS programs are allowed an unlimited number of staffers after previously only allowing 11 on-field coaches, which has alleviated much of the workload, Golding said.\"We've got a lot of coaches here,\" Golding said. \"That's the one thing about Division I football. This building is filled with guys that have been elite coaches everywhere they've been. Once they eliminated the rule to where there's not 10 coaches, as long as they're employed here, you can have a million coaches that can instruct on the field. So at every college across the country, a lot of guys that you all don't know by name are actually the ones instructing and teaching players, and so we have an elite staff here that's been together for a long time that knows the ins and the outs.\"\nGolding said he wasn't sure when he'd receive clarity on the staffing situation. Ole Miss departs for the Fiesta Bowl on Tuesday. Kickoff is slated for Thursday at 7:30 p.m. ET.\"It's grown people making decisions, so I have no idea,\" he said. \"So we're gonna go out there and spot the ball. We've got plenty enough people in this building that showed up this morning. We'll be just fine.\"LSU did not immediately respond to CBS Sports' request for comment.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The race for the NFC South title is officially going to come down to one game: Saints at Falcons. That's right, the division title will be decided by two teams that can't even win the division. That became a reality on Saturday after the Buccaneers secured a 16-14 win over the Panthers in an NFC South showdown that didn't end up deciding anything. If Carolina won the game, the Panthers would have clinched the division title, but because the Bucs won, the Saints-Falcons game on Sunday will now decide who wins the division. How is that even possible? That's a great question. Let's answer it. The Falcons pulled off a shocker Monday night when they beat the Rams, 27-24. The win improved Atlanta's record to 7-9 -- and that's where things get interesting.  Let's take a quick look at the NFC South standings so we can break down why Atlanta's win made such a huge difference in the division title race. \nTeamOverall recordHead-to-headConference recordBuccaneers8-92-2 (1-1 vs. Falcons, 1-1 vs. Panthers)6-6Panthers8-93-1 (2-0 vs. Falcons, 1-1 vs. Buccaneers)6-6Falcons7-91-3 (0-2 vs. Panthers, 1-1 vs. Buccaneers)6-5If the Falcons beat the Saints, that would create a three-way tie at 8-9. The Panthers would win the division in that scenario due to having the best head-to-head record among all three teams. That means the Panthers will clinch the division title if the Falcons beat the Saints. On the other hand, the Buccaneers will be cheering hard for the Saints, because Tampa Bay will win the division if New Orleans pulls off a win or tie. In that scenario, the Bucs and Panthers would finish in a two-way tie at 8-9. If that happens, Tampa Bay would win the division thanks to the common-games tiebreaker. If the Falcons had lost to the Rams on Monday night, then the Buccaneers would have clinched the division title with their Week 18 win over Carolina.The fact that Baker Mayfield now has to cheer for the Saints is kind of hilarious considering just two months ago, he made it very clear he doesn't like them. \nThe team that ends up winning the NFC South will go into the postseason as the fourth seed and host either the Rams, Seahawks or 49ers in the opening round of the playoffs. Although that might sound like a favorable matchup for one of those three NFC West teams, don't forget: The Buccaneers beat the Seahawks and 49ers this year, while the Panthers beat the Rams.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        No. 6 Duke is 12-1 with wins over NCAA Tournament teams like Kansas, Arkansas, Florida and Michigan State, and yet it enters 2026 with questions aplenty after a second-half collapse to Texas Tech, followed up by Wednesday's sweaty, six-point win over Georgia Tech as a gargantuan 27.5-point favorite.Are we making a mountain out of a molehill? Perhaps, but even Jon Scheyer seems to be searching for the right combinations. Duke shifted the starting lineup for the third time against Georgia Tech, inserting freshman point guard Cayden Boozer into the fray and diverting wing Nik Khamenia to the second unit.We'll learn about the mental fortitude of this Duke team because even though a date with ACC frontrunner Louisville looms on Tuesday, it has to get past 7-7 Florida State before it can get started on the Cardinals' scout. First-year 'Noles coach Luke Loucks is 0-5 against high-major teams, but if Florida State can push Florida, it can get up for Duke.Let's dive into the ins and outs of this ACC matchup.Duke vs. Florida State: Need to knowHigh-variance tilt: Florida State zooms up and down the floor at a breakneck pace and tries to shoot as many 3-pointers as possible. FSU's offense has the fifth-fastest average possession length, and 54% of its shots come from downtown. Loucks doesn't have Alabama's star power yet, but he is using Nate Oats' game plan on offense. Shooting this many 3s opens up the door for some wild outcomes ... good and bad. So far for Florida State, it's been mostly bad. They shot just 9-for-41 (22%) from downtown against Texas A&M and got smoked by 36 against an Aggies club that is in a similar tier from a talent perspective. We have yet to see FSU get it rolling from downtown against a high-major team. Duke surely doesn't want to become the first team that lets FSU's barrage of snipers get hot, or a dogfight could emerge.\nWill FSU keep Duke from hanging on rims? North Carolina threw down 12 dunks against Florida State on Tuesday. That was the most UNC had in a single game since 2011. Now, FSU has to face off against Cameron Boozer and Patrick Ngongba? That's no fun. There are easy buckets to be had in the paint against this Florida State defense that is vulnerable when it cannot generate takeaways.Will Duke's leaky pick-and-roll defense get shored up? Texas Tech's Christian Anderson took a blowtorch to Duke's pick-and-roll defense, and Scheyer had to pivot to a zone defense in the second half to find some answers after Georgia Tech's ball-handlers were creating far too many advantages. Duke will have its hands full with FSU point guard Robert McCray V, who ranks sixth in the country in assists (7.1). Caleb Foster will get the first turn, but Duke's switch-heavy defense means anyone on the floor better be ready to sit down and try to guard McCray.  Where to watch Duke vs. Florida State live  Date: Saturday, Jan. 3 | Time: 3:45 p.m. ETLocation: Tucker Arena -- Tallahassee, FloridaTV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports AppStreaming on Paramount+ Premium    \nDuke vs. Florida State prediction, picks\nMaking a billion 3-pointers (in reality, like 22 treys) feels like Florida State's only hope to spring this upset. Everything else screams Duke in this one. FSU is a poor defensive-rebounding team. Georgia, Florida and UNC all corralled 15+ offensive rebounds. Ngongba, Cameron Boozer and Maliq Brown should be licking their chops to go to war on the glass. Plus, the pivot to playing Cayden Boozer with Caleb Foster in a two-point guard look should pay dividends in this one. Florida State will pressure the basketball relentlessly. Having two point guards who can break that first wave of pressure should unlock a ton of advantages in this one.I also do not think FSU has enough capable ball-handlers outside of McCray to consistently break down this Duke defense. Duke has been so good at grinding teams to a halt with its switches. If that happens, Florida State has to hope McCray goes nuclear because there's not a ton of other true switch-beaters on this FSU roster. If it attacks the paint, does its thing on the glass, blankets the 3-point stripe, controls the tempo and moves the ball without panicking, Duke can run away with this one. Pick: Duke -15\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            Duke -15\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Florida St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Florida St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    SU\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    Who will win and cover in every college basketball game? Visit SportsLine to get picks from the model that simulates each game 10,000 times and is up more than $1,200 for $100 players on its top-rated spread picks the past six years. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Darius Acuff launched his SEC Player of the Year campaign with a bang on Saturday by leading No. 18 Arkansas to an 86-75 win over No. 19 Tennessee in the conference opener for both teams. The Razorbacks' star freshman established a new career-high with 29 points and thoroughly outplayed the only player in the league who finished higher in the 2025 recruiting rankings. Nate Ament's struggle-filed 13-point performance for Tennessee (10-4, 0-1 SEC) underscored the big difference between the SEC's most highly touted diaper dandies. Acuff is about production, whereas Ament is about potential.Ament finished one spot higher in the 247Sports recruiting rankings at No. 4, is higher in the CBS Sports NBA Draft prospect rankings and may wind up having a better NBA career. But there is no debating who the better player is right now.It's Acuff, and it's not particularly close.In two of his last three games, the 6-foot-3 guard has torched two of the most perennially elite defenses in college basketball. In a Dec. 20 loss to Houston, he made 9 of 15 shots from the field, finishing with 27 points, seven assists and five rebounds. \nAgainst the Volunteers, he hit 9 of 16 shots, which included a run of eight straight Arkansas points during the middle of the second half. \nYou won't find another guard in college basketball capable of stacking better performances against those two defenses. Such performances are becoming routine for Acuff.This time of year, it can be hard to decipher what's real and what's fake. Some players pad their stats against poor competition in November and December, then crash back to reality in league play. Freshmen are among the most susceptible, as the grind of college basketball begins taking its toll.\nBut all indications so far are that Acuff may be impervious to the trend. His least productive games this season came against Winthrop and Jackson State.Much of his best work has come against Arkansas' best competition. He's scored at least 16 points against every high-major opponent, which bodes well for the Razorbacks hopes of contending in the SEC. A year ago, the Razorbacks took a 76-52 loss at Tennessee to open league play.It was a harbinger of the struggles to come for a program that dug out of an 0-5 hole to finish 8-10 in the conference before making a surprising Sweet 16 run as a No. 10 seed.\nCinderella's slippers were a strange look for the Razorbacks, and the Hogs appear to have traded them in for a pair of boots this year. Arkansas went pound-for-pound with a physical Tennessee team on the glass and in the paint, blocking a season-high 10 shots.Acuff better than AmentArkansas isn't elite defensively yet, but there were encouraging signs against Tennessee. Billy Richmond hounded Nate Ament in the backcourt at one point and forced a 10-second violation. Then with 3:20 to play in a five-point game, the Razorbacks forced a 5-second violation as Ament couldn't find anywhere to pass the ball. \nThose two turnovers were part of a frustrating day for the 6-foot-10 prospect. Ament finished just 5 of 11 from the free-throw line and didn't reach double figures until the game was out of reach in the final minute.\nTennessee and Arkansas are configured differently, as the Volunteers also have a veteran point guard in Ja'Kobi Gillespie and a well-established defense. But the fate of both teams will be determined by how far their freshman stars can take them.Acuff is already playing at an All-American level. With the Razorbacks mired in an early slump, he provided their first seven points. Later on, he capped an 8-0 run with a dagger of a 3-pointer to put Arkansas ahead 79-68 with 2:09 remaining. At every turn of his first SEC game, he rose to meet the moment.Arkansas coach John Calipari has shepherded the development of many great freshman guards over the decades. He's got his next great one.\nRick Barnes has coached his share of elite freshmen as well, both at Tennessee and Texas. There is no denying Ament's potential.But Saturday's SEC opener was a reminder of the difference between potential and production when it comes to building around freshmen.Tennessee has promise with Ament. Arkansas has a sure-thing with Acuff.\n            ",

    "body": "\nIt's Week 18 of the 2025 NFL season, which means it's the last time we'll see all 32 teams in action until September. Most of the postseason field is set as far as the teams are concerned, but divisions and seeding are up for grabs across the 16 games on Saturday and Sunday. Week 18 can be a tricky one for bettors due to varying motivation factors and whatnot, and injuries also play a big role. Here's a look at the most notable NFL injuries of Week 18 as well as a quick snapshot of which teams are expected to rest key starters. We'll also look at NFL betting lines per the latest DraftKings Sportsbook odds. We will update this post with inactives lists for every team prior to kickoff.Panthers at Buccaneers (4:30 p.m. ET, Saturday)No major injuries of note\nThe Panthers can win their first NFC South title since 2015 with a win over the Buccaneers on Saturday, while Tampa Bay needs a win and a loss by the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday to win the franchise's fifth division title in a row. The good news is, both teams enter the final week of the season in pretty good shape health-wise.Tampa Bay is a 3-point favorite. The total is 43.5.Seahawks at 49ers (8 p.m. ET, Saturday)SEA OT Charles Cross (hamstring, out)SF TE George Kittle (ankle, will play)SF OT Trent Williams (hamstring, out)SF WR Ricky Pearsall (knee and ankle, out)\nThe winner of this matchup will take home both the NFC West and secure the No. 1 seed in the conference. The 49ers won this matchup back in Week 1 by a final score of 17-13 in Seattle. Both teams enter Week 18 on six-game win streaks. The Seahawks will again be without starting left tackle Charles Cross, this time against a tough San Francisco defensive front. The 49ers' main injuries are on offense, Trent Williams and Ricky Pearsall are out, though tight end George Kittle will play. All three were questionable heading into the weekend.Seattle is favored by 2.5 points on the road. The total is 47.5.Packers at Vikings (1 p.m. ET)GB QB Malik Willis (shoulder and hamstring, questionable)GB WR Dontayvion Wicks (concussion, doubtful)MIN TE T.J. Hockenson (shoulder, out)MIN RB Aaron Jones (hip, out)\nThe Packers are locked into the No. 7 seed in the NFC, so expect to see many key contributors on the sideline for Green Bay against a Vikings team that is hoping J.J. McCarthy's solid end to the season can be a building block for 2026. McCarthy is back after missing last week with yet another injury, but he won't have his top running back in Aaron Jones or tight end T.J. Hockenson. With the Packers set to rest many key starters, Minnesota is favored by 9.5. The total is 37.5.Cowboys at Giants (1 p.m. ET)DAL RB Javonte Williams (shoulder and neck, out)DAL RB Malik Davis (calf and eye, out)NY TE Theo Johnson (illness, out)NY WR Wan'Dale Robinson (rib, out)\nBoth offenses are shorthanded here with both of Dallas top running backs out, including 1,000-yard rusher Javonte Williams, while two of New York's top receiving options are out for Week 18. Dallas enters Week 18 favored by 3.5. The total is 49.5.Colts at Texans (1 p.m. ET)IND CB Sauce Gardner (calf, out)\nThe Texans are hoping to get a win and some help in order to win the AFC South this weekend, and they're in good shape on the injury front. Injuries have played a part in the Colts' epic collapse after they started 2025 as one of the best teams in the NFL. They'll again be without top cornerback Sauce Gardner, and the team will turn to rookie Riley Leonard in Week 18, ending Philip Rivers' shocking NFL return at three weeks. The Texans are 10-point favorites. The total is 38.5.Browns at Bengals (1 p.m. ET)CLE TE Harold Fannin Jr. (groin, out)CLE TE David Njoku (knee, out)\nTwo teams that struggle in very different  ways meet in Week 18. The Browns' scuffling offense is down two top playmakers in tight ends Harold Fannin Jr. and David Njoku, meaning two fewer weapons for Shedeur Sanders against a Bengals defense that's horrific at defending tight ends.  Cincinnati is a 7.5-point favorite while the total sits at 44.5.Saints at Falcons (1 p.m. ET)NO RB Alvin Kamara (knee and ankle, out)NO WR Chris Olave (blood clot, out)ATL WR Drake London (knee, questionable)ATL TE Kyle Pitts (knee, questionable)\nTop playmakers for both offenses are out or questionable here, as the Saints are down top receiver Chris Olave due to a blood clot scare while running back Alvin Kamara remains out with multiple injuries. Two of Atlanta's top pass catchers are questionable here in Drake London and Kyle Pitts. If the Bucs win Saturday, they need the Falcons to lose in order to win the NFC South.Atlanta is favored by 3.5, and the total is 43.5.Titans at Jaguars (1 p.m. ET)No major injuries of note\nThe Jaguars have plenty to play for this week, as a win clinches them the AFC South, while a win and some help could net them the No. 1 seed in the conference. The good news for Jacksonville is the team is in good shape health-wise against a Titans team that's just trying to get across the finish line and find its next head coach.The Jaguars are 13.5-point favorites here, and the total is 47.5.Cardinals at Rams (4:25 p.m. ET)ARI WR Marvin Harrison Jr. (foot, injured reserve)LA WR Davante Adams (hamstring, questionable)LA RB Kyren Williams (ankle, questionable)LA RB Blake Corum (ankle, questionable)\nThe Cardinals are just looking to finish what's been a dreadful 2025 campaign, while the Rams are licking their wounds after consecutive close losses that cost them the NFC West and a shot at the No. 1 seed. Arizona is down Marvin Harrison Jr. for this season finale, while Davante Adams, Kyren Williams and Blake Corum are all questionable to suit up for L.A. Los Angeles is favored by 8.5. The total is 46.5.Commanders at Eagles (4:25 p.m. ET)WASH QB Marcus Mariota (hand and quad, out)PHI OT Lane Johnson (foot, out)PHI DT Jalen Carter (shoulders, out)PHI TE Dallas Goedert (knee) \nThe Eagles are expected to take things easy in Week 18 by resting key players ahead of the postseason, a strategy that worked well last year ahead of a Super Bowl run. Tanner McKee is expected to start at quarterback for Philly. The Commanders, meanwhile, are down to their third quarterback as Marcus Mariota, who has been starting in place of the injured Jayden Daniels, is out for Week 18, setting up a start for journeyman Josh Johnson.The Eagles are favored by 4.5, and the total is 38.5.Chargers at Broncos (4:25 p.m. ET)LA RB Omarion Hampton (ankle, out)LA RB Kimani Vidal (neck, questionable)\nThe Chargers will rest many key players in Week 18, including quarterback Justin Herbert, who had surgery on his left hand a few weeks ago. For this matchup with Denver, which can clinch the No. 1 seed in the AFC with a win, the Chargers will be without rookie running back Omarion Hampton, who has over 700 scrimmage yards in nine games this year. No. 2 back Kimani Vidal is questionable to suit up.Denver is a massive 12.5-point favorite, and the total is 37.5.Jets at Bills (4:25 p.m. ET)NY RB Breece Hall (knee, questionable)NY TE Mason Taylor (neck, out)BUF TE Dalton Kincaid (knee, questionable)\nThe Bills are just trying to improve their playoff seeding in Week 18, and they face a Jets team that has really struggled and will be without most of its top weapons on offense. Garrett Wilson has been out for some time, rookie tight end Mason Taylor is out once again and star running back Breece Hall is questionable. Tight end Dalton Kincaid is questionable for Buffalo due to a nagging knee injury.Buffalo is a 7.5-point favorite. The total is 37.5.Dolphins at Patriots (4:25 p.m. ET)MIA RB De'Von Achane (shoulder, doubtful)MIA WR Jaylen Waddle (ribs, questionable)MIA TE Darren Waller (groin, injured reserve)\nThe Patriots can clinch the top seed in the AFC with a win and a Broncos loss on Sunday, and they will face a rather depleted Dolphins offense in Week 18. Star running back De'Von Achane is doubtful, while No. 1 receiver Jaylen Waddle is questionable. Tight end Darren Waller was also placed on injured reserve this week.The Patriots are favored by 11.5, and the total sits at 45.5.Lions at Bears (4:25 p.m. ET)DET WR Amon-Ra St. Brown (knee and ankle, questionable)CHI WR Rome Odunze (foot, questionable)\nThe Lions have nothing to play for but pride in Week 18, while the Bears can secure the No. 7 seed in the NFC with a win. Detroit may be without star receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown, who has been hobbled by various ailments the last few weeks. Rome Odunze is aiming to return for the Bears after missing time with a nagging foot injury. Chicago is a 3-point favorite. The total is the highest of the entire Week 18 slate at 50.5. Chiefs at Raiders (4:25 p.m. ET)KC RB Isiah Pacheco (rest, questionable)KC WR Xavier Worthy (illness, doubtful)LV QB Geno Smith (ankle, out)\nThe Raiders are playing for pride at this point as their 10-game losing streak has them in line for the No. 1 pick in April's NFL Draft. They will be down quarterback Geno Smith, who is out with an ankle injury. Both Kenny Pickett and Aidan O'Connell are expected to see the field. The Chiefs usually have nothing to play for in Week 18, but that's because they've often clinched a postseason berth and a high seed. Instead, the Chiefs are just playing things out in a lost season that sees third-string QB Chris Oladokun starts once again. The Chiefs are 5.5-point favorites, and the total is 36.5.Ravens at Steelers (8:20 p.m. ET)BAL QB Lamar Jackson (back, will play)PITT LB T.J. Watt (lung, will play)\nThe AFC North will be decided in the final game of the 2025 regular season. The Ravens are 8-8 while the Steelers are 9-7, and the winner will secure the No. 4 seed in the AFC. Both teams will get their best player back for Week 18 as Lamar Jackson returns from a back injury that cost him last week while T.J. Watt returns to the Steelers' defense after he suffered a collapsed lung during a dry needling session.Baltimore is a 3.5-point road favorite. The total is 41.5.\n            ",

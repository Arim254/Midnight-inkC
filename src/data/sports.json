The Week 10 college football schedule is action-packed, with top matchups including Florida vs. Georgia, Tennessee vs. Oklahoma and Utah vs. Cincinnati. SportsLine's projection model and team of experts has provided picks for all three games on FanDuel and combined them for a Saturday college football parlay that pays +738. Claim the latest FanDuel promo code here:Check out our FanDuel promo code review for full details.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every college football game 10,000 times. Since its inception, it has generated a betting profit of over $2,000 for $100 players on its top-rated college spread football picks, and it enters Week 10 on a profitable 47-33 combined run on money-line and over/under college football picks since the beginning of 2024. Anybody following its college football betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Best Saturday picksFlorida vs. Georgia: Over 50.5 total points (-110)Oklahoma +122 vs. TennesseeUtah (-10.5) vs. Cincinnati (-108)Combining the model's three picks into a three-leg parlay at FanDuel would result in a payout of +738 (risk $100 to win $738). Bet it at FanDuel here:\nFlorida vs. Georgia: Over 50.5 points (-110)\"Sometimes the trends don't lie in the game formerly called the 'World's Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party'...at least on paper,\" SportsLine college football expert Eric Cohen said. \"Georgia has scored 34 or more points (including in the 40s three times) against Florida in each of the last five meetings. The Gators have scored 20 points in each of the last three years against the Bulldogs. Sometimes it's best not to overthink things.\" Bet the Georgia vs. Florida over at FanDuel Sportsbook:Oklahoma +122 vs. TennesseeBoth of these teams have suffered two losses already and likely need to win out to make the College Football Playoff, so this feels like an elimination game of sorts. It's also a strength-on-strength matchup, as Tennessee ranks second in the nation in scoring (45.6 ppg) and Oklahoma ranks fifth in scoring defense (12.5 ppg). However, while things have been difficult at times for the Sooners, they're at least capable offensively. Tennessee's defense, on the other hand, is another story. The model has Oklahoma winning in 47% of simulations, while these odds imply a slightly lower win probability of 44.3%. Bet the Oklahoma moneyline at FanDuel Sportsbook:Utah (-10.5) vs. Cincinnati (-108)\"At first look, this spot seems steep given that Cincy has not lost SU since a three-point decision to Nebraska in its opener. However, the Bearcats will miss injured RB Evan Pryor, their dynamic top ball-toter who averages 7.2 yards per carry,\" SportsLine college football expert Mike Tierney said. \"He has opened it up for QB Brendan Sorsby, who might not be afforded the usual passing lanes. Cincy also must work through a late 10:15 p.m. (ET) kickoff. Utah has taken care of business when favored by 8.5 or more, going 5-0 ATS.\" Bet Utah to cover at FanDuel Sportsbook:\nWant more college football picks?You've seen some of the model's best bets for Saturday.

This price, however, seems to completely dismiss a revived K-State, which has played like many thought it would this season since its mid-September bye,\" legendary college football handicapper Bruce Marshall said. \"After a tough 1-3 start, the Cats are scoring almost 39 ppg since in their four straight covers. QB Avery Johnson has tossed 9 TD passes vs. just 1 pick in those games. Note eight straight wins for the Wildcats vs. the Red Raiders, too.\" Back Kansas State at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Under 55.5 in Ole Miss vs. South Carolina (-110)LaNorris Sellers began the year as a Heisman candidate after a brilliant redshirt freshman season, but the South Carolina offense hasn't clicked in 2025. Sellers is only averaging 169.5 yards per game passing and has also been far less involved in the team's running game, as he's averaged 21.9 yards rushing after averaging 56.2 last season. Ole Miss won this matchup 27-3 last year with the over/under at 53.5 and the model is predicting that South Carolina fails to carry its weight again. It predicts that the Under hits in 64% of simulations. Back the Under at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Under 55.5 in Tennessee vs. Oklahoma (-110)This is also a rematch from a regular-season matchup last year, with Tennessee winning at Oklahoma 25-15 despite the over/under closing at 57. The Volunteers are second in the nation in scoring (45.6 ppg), but will face their greatest test yet in Oklahoma's fifth-ranked scoring defense (12.5 ppg). Josh Heupel's offense tends to be a bit more conservative in high-profile SEC matchups as well.

For the first time in more than a month, USC will play a team without a number before its name, as the Trojans are coming off a 1-2 stretch with three straight games against ranked opponents. USC did go 2-1 against the spread in those three games, though, playing competitively in all three games. The SportsLine model projects a matchup against unranked Nebraska to lead to strong results for the Trojans, making USC covering as 4.5-point favorites one of its Saturday best bets at DraftKings for a 7:30 p.m. ET road contest. The Trojans are 5-2 overall this season, with all five of their victories coming by at least 14 points, making them one of the model's most confident picks of the entire Week 10 college football schedule for Saturday best bets at DraftKings.In addition, the model sees strong value in a pair of college football totals for its Saturday best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook. The model is backing Under 54.5 points for Oklahoma vs. Tennessee in an SEC showdown, but it's taking Over 47.5 points for Washington State vs. Oregon State, which takes place at 7:30 p.m. ET for its Saturday best bets. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins, plus 3 months of NBA League Pass free: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every college football game 10,000 times.

Now, not saying he's going to be the No. 1 overall pick one day, but current Trojans quarterback Jayden Maiava has USC ranked third in the nation in passing yards per game (326.1) and first in total yards (530 per game). USC is No. 2 in scoring offense (42.4 ppg), and the Trojans are 4-1 straight-up in games when favored by at least 4.5 points this season.

Tennessee has the No. 3 scoring offense at 41.9 ppg this season, but Oklahoma has the No. 6 scoring defense at 13.9 ppg allowed this year. The Sooners held teams like Michigan, Auburn and South Carolina to fewer than 20 points, so their statistical success isn't strictly from lopsided non-conference matchups. They also held Texas and Ole Miss to below their season averages, so that could happen again on Saturday for an Under result.

The Colts, behind running back Jonathan Taylor and quarterback Daniel Jones, have taken command of the AFC South at 7-1. Pittsburgh, meanwhile, is in control of the AFC North at 4-3, but have dropped two in a row. Quarterback Aaron Rodgers is coming off a disappointing performance in a loss to the Green Bay Packers, a team he spent 18 years with. Indianapolis enters as a 3.5-point favorite and is one of seven road favorites during the Week 9 NFL schedule, with the Chargers (-9.5 at Tennessee) being the biggest. Another matchup involving contenders sees the Kansas City Chiefs (4-3) visiting the Buffalo Bills (5-2). The Chiefs are 2-point favorites as former MVP quarterbacks Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen square off for the 10th time, with Mahomes holding a 5-4 edge. However, Buffalo has won four straight regular season meetings with Kansas City.

    "body": "\n        Three rookie running backs who have been Fantasy football start/sit decisions all year made huge impacts on Sunday. RJ Harvey scored three touchdowns, Woody Marks went over 100 scrimmage yards and TreVeyon Henderson had a career-high of 75 total yards. Their Week 9 Fantasy football rankings likely received a boost, compared to the week prior, but does that warrant any of them a spot in Week 9 Fantasy football lineups ahead of more established veterans like Nick Chubb, Rhamondre Stevenson or Tony Pollard?Speaking of rookie ball carriers, Cam Skattebo is no longer an option as a Fantasy football pick after dislocating his ankle. Tyrone Tracy Jr. is seemingly the next man up in New York, but what do the Week 9 Fantasy football projections forecast for veteran Devin Singletary? Chiefs RB Isiah Pacheco (knee) has been ruled out, meaning more carries for Kareem Hunt most likely. Before making your Week 9 Fantasy football picks, be sure to check out the Week 9 Fantasy football rankings from the proven computer model at SportsLine. Bet on every NFL Week 9 game at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your $5 initial wager wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:When it comes to ranking players, SportsLine's model beat human experts in Fantasy football for the past several seasons, especially when there were big differences in ranking. Over the course of a season, that could literally be the difference between winning your league or going home empty-handed.The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, including being ahead of the curve on players like A.J. Brown, Jonathan Taylor, Derrick Henry, Christian McCaffrey, Alvin Kamara and Jahmyr Gibbs. Anybody who banked on players like those could have made a run at their league title.Now, the model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, has revealed its Fantasy football rankings for Week 9 of the 2025 NFL season. Head to SportsLine now to see them. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. Top Week 9 Fantasy football picks One surprise in Week 9: The model is fading Bengals receiver Tee Higgins, a two-time 1,000-yard wideout who has touchdowns in three of his last four games. However, Higgins hasn't been quite as productive, as a whole, as he's been in previous years. He's averaging career lows in both yards per game (45) and receptions per game (3.1), thus making his reliance on touchdowns a risky proposition for his Fantasy owners. He has an over/under of 52.5 receiving yards in this one. Higgins' touchdown reception in his last game was his lone catch of the game and now has to face a Chicago defense, whose strength is versus the pass. The Bears are allowing just 9.4 receptions per game to opposing wide receivers, which is the second-fewest in the league. Chicago hasn't allowed a single wideout to reach 100 yards since Week 2, and only one receiver has more than five catches over that span. Sitting outside the top 25 in Week 9 Fantasy football WR rankings, Higgins may not warrant a spot in Fantasy football lineups.Another curveball: The model is high on Chargers tight end Oronde Gadsden II. The fifth-round rookie has made a name for himself over the last three weeks and ranks second amongst tight ends in Fantasy points over this stretch. He had a 5-77-1 stat line last Thursday, which followed seven receptions for 164 yards and a score in his previous outing. Gadsden has started just two games this year but still has as many redzone receptions (four) as Chargers wideouts Keenan Allen, Ladd McConkey and Quentin Johnston.He now gets a dream matchup versus the Titans, who rank 29th in points allowed and 26th in yards allowed, and just saw their thin secondary further decimated by trading cornerback Roger McCreary to the Rams. Tennessee has given up at least 50 receiving yards or a touchdown to tight ends in each of the last three weeks. Gadsden wasn't on the Fantasy radar a few weeks ago but now finds himself among the top five in positional rankings for this week, making him a must-start for Week 9 Fantasy football lineups.

    "body": "\n        One way or another, Major League Baseball will crown the World Series champion on Saturday night. The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Toronto Blue Jays on Friday night in Game 6, evening the series and necessitating the two sides play World Series Game 7 to determine a winner. It's the first Game 7 in the Fall Classic since 2019.The Dodgers are attempting to become MLB's first repeat World Series winner since the New York Yankees won three Fall Classics in a row from 1998-2000. On the other side, the Blue Jays are hoping to claim their first World Series victory since they won back-to-back titles in 1992-93.From a historical perspective, the odds would still seem to favor the Blue Jays. MLB teams to take a 3-2 lead in a best-of-seven series have then won the series on roughly 70% of their attempts. That's even while possessing a losing record in Game 6 situations. In other words, the idea that the Dodgers have a lot of momentum working in their favor falls apart when precedent is examined.As part of CBS Sports' Game 7 coverage, we polled our baseball staff one last time on who they expect to prevail on Saturday night.

Historically, MLB teams to take a 3-2 edge in a best-of-seven series have then won the series roughly 70% of the time -- that despite having a losing record in Game 6. Even so, I picked the Dodgers to win the World Series at the start of the postseason, and I would be a fool and/or a coward to bail now. I am, at best, one of those things (as evidenced by me also picking the New York Yankees to win the AL). More seriously: I do think the Dodgers can piece together nine innings from their collection of available starters (Shohei Ohtani, Tyler Glasnow and Blake Snell), and hitters at the top of their lineup looked a lot more like their usual selves in Game 6 than they had previously. Dodgers 5, Blue Jays 3Axisa: I picked Toronto to win in seven games before the series, and I see no reason to go against that. The Dodgers still aren't hitting -- they scored three runs in the third inning of Game 6 and had three baserunners the rest of the game -- and I trust Toronto's pitching in an all-hands-on-deck game more than L.A.'s. The Blue Jays have been hit with a lot of \"how do they come back from that?\" moments this year and yet they keep coming back. They'll meet the moment and win their first World Series since 1993. Blue Jays 6, Dodgers 5Feldman: I was pretty sure this series was going to be an easy Dodgers win ... until they actually started playing the games. There's just something magical about these Blue Jays, and I need to believe in a little magic. Blue Jays 4, Dodgers 2\nMcWilliams: The Blue Jays will pull this one out. I've bet against them so many times, and I just can't do it again. They respond to all the adversity that has been thrown at them. I expect them to respond one last time. Blue Jays 7, Dodgers 2Perry: I think the Blue Jays are better set up on the pitching front going into Game 7, although I don't have a great deal of faith in decline-phase Max Scherzer (as great as his career has been). The deeper Toronto lineup will carry the night against an uncertain Dodger pitching script. Blue Jays 6, Dodgers 4Snyder: I won't be surprised either way, but the Jays still feel like they've got this thing. Their losses in this series have come with Yoshinobu Yamamoto dominating them and in an 18-inning marathon which could've easily swung their way. They don't have to see Yamamoto in Game 7 and their pitching is in a bit better shape heading to Game 7. Much like in the ALCS, they'll answer the call here at home. Blue Jays 6, Dodgers 4\n            ",

The former first-round draft pick of the Carolina Panthers in the 2017 NFL Draft is finally healthy after a lost 2024 season. Through eight games, he has rushed for 490 yards and three touchdowns, while catching 56 passes for 559 yards and three touchdowns.McCaffrey had a monster game in a 20-10 win over the Atlanta Falcons on Oct. 19. In that game, he carried 24 times for 129 yards and two touchdowns, while catching seven passes for 72 yards, including a long of 17. He has rushed for at least 50 yards in six of eight games, and has also caught no fewer than three passes for 43 or more yards. In fact, he has 70-plus receiving yards in five games. See who else to roster here.Part of McClure's optimal NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering Bengals wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase. The former first round pick by Cincinnati in the 2021 NFL Draft has been instant offense. In just 4½ seasons, he has played in 70 games with 465 receptions for 6,145 yards and 51 touchdowns.

Pittsburgh enters off two straight losses where they have surrendered more than 30 points, while Indianapolis has won four straight contests, having scored 31 points or more in each game.\"Pittsburgh's defense has looked awful in their last two games against Cincinnati and Green Bay, so how could they possibly fare that much better against the league's highest scoring team? Football, especially in the NFL, is a funny game. This Week 9 home contest is a must for the Steelers who need to build up as much ground as they can between themselves and the soon-to-be-charging Ravens. Indianapolis is currently the frontrunner for the AFC's No. 1 seed, but that can't last too much longer, right? It seems like the fairy tell has to come to an end at some point.

    "body": "\n        It's not a primetime game, but the contest many will highlight with their Week 9 NFL picks is Chiefs vs. Bills at 4:25 p.m. ET on Sunday. It's become, arguably, the league's preeminent rivalry, and the latest installment has Kansas City as the 2-point road favorite, per the Week 9 NFL odds. Meanwhile, other contests to be of high interest with NFL bets involve a pair of West Coast teams flying east in 49ers vs. Giants (+2.5) and Seahawks vs. Commanders (+3) on Monday night.If looking for a divisional rivalry when scanning the latest Week 9 NFL lines, you'll just find one in Lions vs. Vikings. Any rest advantage Minnesota hoped for from playing last Thursday is negated by Detroit coming off a bye, and the Lions are one of the biggest favorites, per the Week 9 NFL spreads, as they're giving 8.5 points. Other large lines include Packers vs. Panthers (+13.5), Chargers vs. Titans (+9.5) and Rams vs. Saints (+14) as rookie Tyler Shough will get his first career start. All of the updated Week 9 NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Week 9 NFL picks now. LIMITED TIME: Use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1 JOIN NOW. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your initial $5 bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

Much has been made about Denver's defense, which ranks fifth in both scoring and total, but Houston boasts the No. 1 defense in both points allowed and yards allowed. It has a +7 turnover differential over the last four games, while Denver has a negative turnover differential (-1) on the season. The Texans offense is also rounding into form as C.J. Stroud had his first 300-yard passing game in Sunday's win over San Francisco, and he was not sacked for the first time this season.Houston has now covered in three of its last four, while Denver is 0-2 versus the line as a road favorite. The Broncos have some questions with their passing game, as the team ranks in the bottom 10 in completion percentage and yards per attempt, while Bo Nix has often come up short in true road games. Nix is just 2-7 outright over his last nine starts in away stadiums as the model has Houston prevailing versus the spread over 50% of the time. See which other teams to pick here.\nAnother one of its Week 9 NFL predictions: the Chargers (-9.5, 43.5) cover versus the Titans in nearly 60% of simulations. The firing of Brian Callahan hasn't provided the spark that many Titans fans hoped for as the team's lost its two games since, one by 18 points at home and the other by 24 points on the road. Each of Tennessee's last six losses have come by double-digits, and many of those weren't versus teams that are the caliber of the Chargers. Los Angeles ranks in the top eight of the NFL in yards gained, yards allowed, passing offense and passing defense.Meanwhile, Tennessee is dead last in nearly every offensive category, and no team has allowed more rushing touchdowns on defense. The Titans are a staggering 4-21 against the spread since 2024, which is worst in the NFL and amounts to a 16% cover rate. Cam Ward doesn't have a single game so far in which he has more touchdowns than turnovers, as the Chargers are forecasted for a double-digit victory. The model also says the Over hits in over 50% of simulations. See which other teams to pick here.\nHow to make Week 9 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 9 NFL schedule and just revealed four teams that win by double-digits, potentially giving you a huge payday. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine.So what Week 9 NFL picks can you make with confidence, and which four teams should you lock in now?

MLB rules allow him to stay in the game as the designated hitter for the entire game if he starts as the pitcher. The Dodgers, however, are expected to have the whole pitching staff available except for Yoshinobu Yamamoto. Ohtani, who has +176 odds to hit a home run, is also among the Dodgers' top hitters. In 158 games during the regular season, he hit .282 with 55 homers, 25 doubles, nine triples, 102 RBI, 146 runs scored and 20 stolen bases. He is hitting .250 during the postseason, but has two doubles, one triple, eight homers and 14 RBI. Also helping propel the offense is right fielder Teoscar Hernandez. In 16 postseason games, he is batting .269 with one double, five home runs and 12 RBI. He is 7-for-26 in the series, including a 2-for-4 performance in a 6-1 Game 5 loss to the Blue Jays on Wednesday. In 134 regular-season games, he batted .247 with 29 doubles, one triple, 25 homers and 89 RBI. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why the Blue Jays can winRight-hander Max Scherzer (5-5, 5.19 ERA) will start for Toronto. The feisty veteran is no stranger to pitching in big games. He was a member of the World Series championship teams in Washington in 2019 and Texas in 2023. In two postseason games this year, he is 1-0 with a 4.50 ERA. In Game 4 of the American League Championship Series, he earned the win by pitching 5.2 innings, allowing just three hits, two earned runs and four walks with five strikeouts in an 8-2 victory over the Seattle Mariners.First baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr. is having a monster postseason. Heading into Game 6, Guerrero had a 10-game hitting streak and was hitting .415. In 16 playoff games, Guerrero had three doubles, eight homers, 15 RBI and 12 walks. In Game 3 of the ALCS against Seattle, he was 4-for-4 with two doubles and a home run in a 13-4 win.

    "body": "\n        Army (3-4) is on a mission to eliminate Air Force (2-5) from contention in the 2025 Commander-in-Chief's Trophy race when it travels to Falcon Stadium on Saturday for a key matchup in one of college football's most storied rivalries. The game kicks off at noon ET on CBS.The Black Knights have controlled the series lately, winning six of the past eight meetings, though this will be their first trip to Colorado Springs since 2019.Click here to bet Air Force vs. Army at BetMGM Sportsbook, where new users get up to $1,500 in bonus bets back if their first wager doesn't win with the promo code CBSSPORTS:Army enters with a continued emphasis on its ground attack, led by quarterback Cale Hellums, who has rushed for 10 touchdowns this season -- tied for fourth-most among FBS quarterbacks. Defensively, the Black Knights have dominated the Falcons in recent years, allowing just one touchdown across the past three meetings while forcing 10 turnovers in that span.\nAir Force counters with sophomore dual-threat quarterback Liam Szarka, who has rushed for 725 yards and nine touchdowns while throwing for more than 1,000 yards this season, emerging as one of the nation's most versatile offensive weapons.Follow along with live updates, highlights and analysis as Army meets Air Force on Saturday.    Army vs. Air Force: Need to know   Rushing showdown: Army and Air Force rank among the FBS's top four rushing offenses in yards per game. The Black Knights average 275.6 yards per contest, while the Falcons are slightly ahead at 283.7. What stands out, though, is the difference in efficiency against FBS opponents: Air Force (55.4%) ranks third nationally, while Army (49.5%) is tied for 26th.\nField general: Army linebacker Andon Thomas leads the defense with 59 total tackles this season. One of the most experienced Black Knights on that side of the ball, the 6-foot, 230-pound senior has 20 starts since the beginning of last season. His presence will be key in slowing Air Force's attack, which has averaged 6.2 yards per carry over its last two games.Historical context: Army has struggled historically in Colorado Springs, winning just four times at Falcon Stadium, most recently in 2017. Air Force leads the all-time series, 38-20-1. This will be Army's first visit to Falcon Stadium since 2019, making it a significant test for the Black Knights as they look to maintain recent success in the series and gain an edge in the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy race.

But the Falcons showed signs of life recently, finally prevailing for a win against Wyoming in Week 8 to snap a five-game losing skid, which included back-to-back defeats by a field goal.

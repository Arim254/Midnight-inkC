The Buccaneers are hopeful that Mike Evans and Emeka Egbuka (both battling hamstring injuries) will be able to play tonight and that certainly lends itself well to scoring.

The Seahawks have been anything but, ranking first in yards per play with an elite passing attack that has a chance to beat Houston's pass defense in a strength vs. strength matchup,\" CBS Sports Gambling and Fantasy editor R.J. White said. \"The major edge is on the other side of the ball, as the Seahawks also have an elite defense while the Texans offense looked awful prior to its uncompetitive matchups.\" Back the Seahawks at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Mariners money line vs. Blue Jays (+110)\"Recency bias can be hard to overlook in a crucial game seven to decide who goes to the World Series. The Toronto Blue Jays have captured that with winning three out of the past four games over Seattle. In fact they had game five in their grasp as well before a five run eighth inning from the Mariners,\" SportsLine handicapper Zack Cimini said. \"The turn of events was sparked in game three by Shane Bieber but look for this Mariners team to respond as they did in the ALDS against Detroit in game five.

Mayfield was transparent afterwards when asked about his exchange with referee John Hussey and his overall thoughts on the night's officiating crew.\"A third down defensive holding call that wasn't called, and also still pretty damn confused about the double review,\" said Mayfield, who didn't hold back. \"A lot of things in that game that were a little questionable ... I work my ass off, and I put a lot into this game, so when [calls are made] that I don't think are deemed fair, I'm going to let somebody know.\"  The \"double review\" that Mayfield referenced occurred early in the fourth quarter when Mayfield completed a four-yard pass to tight end Cade Otton on a fourth-and-4 play. The officials upheld that Otton had secured the catch and subsequent first down after the Lions challenged the play. \nTo the surprise of everyone, Hussey was called back to monitor and ultimately reversed the call on the field, giving the Lions possession and also awarding Detroit its timeout back. That was the second overturned play of the night involving Mayfield and Otton. Late in the first half, the officials overturned a three-yard completion to Otton while determining that Mayfield's pass was instead intercepted by Arthur Maulet. By rule, possession is awarded to the offensive player where is 50-50 possession. There's no denying that the Buccaneers were on the wrong side of the close calls on Monday night. That being said, Tampa Bay's loss was also a byproduct of the Lions simply playing better on both sides of the ball, especially on the ground. Detroit ran for 164 yards that included 136 yards and two scores by Jahmyr Gibbs. Conversely, the Buccaneers ran for just 41 yards on 12 carries as they spent the majority of the game playing from behind. \nAdding insult to injury was the fact that Mayfield's squad lost one of their its players in Mike Evans, who is slated to miss the majority of the Buccaneers' remaining regular season games after breaking his collarbone during the second quarter. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Mike Evans, one of the NFL's most durable and productive players for the past decade, will miss most of the remaining games on the Buccaneers' regular season schedule after breaking his collarbone, Tampa Bay coach Todd Bowles said following Monday night's 24-9 loss to the Lions. Evans, who was labeled as questionable prior to the game with a hamstring issue, left the game after nearly coming down with a deep pass from quarterback Baker Mayfield with five minutes to play in the first half. Evans stayed on the ground for several moments before being helped off the field. He was carted into the Buccaneers' locker room shortly thereafter. A perennial Pro Bowl receiver, injuries have limited Evans to four games this season. He caught just 14 of 28 targets for 140 yards and one touchdown during his first three games of the 2025 season. Evans did not catch any of his four targets on Monday night prior to getting injured.\nThe 32-year-old Evans tied Jerry Rice's NFL record last year by recording his 11th consecutive 1,000-yard receiving season. Evans' 11 consecutive seasons with 1,000 receiving yards is the most in NFL history to start a career. \nTampa Bay, who trailed Detroit 14-0 at the time of Evans' injury, has dealt with a litany of injuries this season. Along with Evans, the Buccaneers have also dealt with injuries to fellow starters Chris Godwin, Bucky Irving, Emeka Egbuka, Calijah Kancey and Cody Mauch, among others. Despite their injury issues, the Buccaneers won five of their first six games and are in their familiar spot atop the NFC South standings. Without Evans, Mayfield will have to rely more on fellow wideouts Egbuka, Tez Johnson and Sterling Shepard. Egbuka caught just 4 of 12 targets for 58 yards on Monday while playing through a hamstring injury. Johnson, a rookie seventh-round pick, also caught four passes for 58 yards against the Lions that included his second touchdown catch in as many games. Evans is one of the most decorated players in Buccaneers history. This summer, he was ranked by the team as the fourth-greatest player in team history as part of the franchise's 50th anniversary celebration. \nA valuable member of Tampa Bay's Super Bowl LV championship team, Evans is 10th all-time with 106 career touchdown catches. He is 22nd all-time with 12,824 career receiving yards and 34th all-time with 850 receptions. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Chapter 49 of Seattle Mariners baseball is complete. It was better than the previous 48 chapters in many, many ways. Unfortunately, much like every other entry into this story, the ending was unhappy.The Mariners were just eight outs away from the World Series. They had a two-run lead in the seventh inning of ALCS Game 7 against the Blue Jays on Monday night. Instead of closing things out, perhaps the most heartbreaking chapter was added to the story of the franchise: A 4-3 defeat that sent the Jays to the World Series and the Mariners home.The 2025 Mariners made it further into the season than any other Mariners team, yet they still fell short of the World Series and, on that level, that makes them no different than the previous 48 iterations of this franchise.The Seattle Mariners remain one of five current MLB franchises to have never won the World Series, along with the Colorado Rockies, Tampa Bay Rays, Milwaukee Brewers and San Diego Padres. The Mariners are the only team out of 30 to have never played in the Fall Classic.\nStill, while the ultimate goal is always winning a championship, we shouldn't pretend the Mariners in 2025 were equally as successful as the 2025 Rockies or White Sox or Nationals -- or the Rangers or Astros, for that matter. The 2025 season for the Mariners, even though they fell short of the two biggest goals, was a successful one. They won the AL West for the first time since 2001 on the strength of a furious rally in September during which they won 17 of 18 games. It was only their fourth division title and sixth playoff berth. It was only the eighth time in franchise history they won 90 games. This season marked the fourth trip to the ALCS for the franchise and the first time they got to Game 7. Contrary to the belief of some -- and I've fought this battle for years -- you're allowed to have fun and celebrate moments other than winning the championship. It's obviously the most fun as a fan when your team wins it all, but there are plenty of other moments that bring joy. \nThe Mariners brought their fans a lot this season. How about Cal Raleigh? Never before had a catcher hit even 50 home runs in season. Never had a switch hitter reached 55. Raleigh hit 60. Julio Rodríguez was a 30-30 guy. Randy Arozarena was close. How about Game 2 of the ALDS? How about the 15-inning Game 5 of the ALDS, one of the most dramatic playoff games we've ever seen?Then there's ALCS Game 5. The eighth inning. Raleigh's game-tying blast. Eugenio Suárez's grand slam, anyone? How awesome was that eighth inning? None of that can ever be taken away from Mariners fans. As the dust settles, the front office needs to look forward to the offseason and find ways to repeat this success and then hope everything breaks right to bring that elusive first title. Trade deadline pickups Suárez and Josh Naylor are free agents. Jorge Polanco has a mutual option. Closer Andrés Muñoz has a no-brainer $6 million team option that'll get picked up. From there, everyone else of great importance is rostered and can be built around.   \nThere's a foundation in place to again challenge for the American League pennant. For now, though, let's just reflect on what a run this was for the Mariners ... and their fans. For you, M's fans, it's going to take a few days. Maybe a few weeks. Maybe you'll even need the 2026 season to start. At some point, though, you'll look back at the 2025 season with fondness. Of course you'll lament how it ended, but the good far outweighs the bad here in the aggregate. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Seattle Mariners were eliminated from the playoffs on Monday night, losing Game 7 of the American League Championship Series to the Toronto Blue Jays. The Mariners, who at times in the best-of-seven series held both a 2-0 and 3-2 advantage, led by a 3-1 score entering the bottom of the seventh inning. That's when Blue Jays star George Springer, hobbled earlier in the series when he was struck by an errant pitch to his right knee, unloaded what proved to be a decisive three-run home run.\nJust as notable as Springer's home run, the 23rd of his postseason career, was what happened right beforehand, when Mariners manager Dan Wilson made a pitching change. Wilson, in his first full year at the helm, removed right-hander Bryan Woo in favor of Eduard Bazardo. For as good as Bazardo was during the regular season, when he appeared 73 times and amassed a 2.52 ERA (150 ERA+), it's only natural that folks second-guessed Wilson and wondered if he should've gone directly to closer Andrés Muñoz.\"Bazardo's been doing it all season long and has been so consistent at it and he's done such a good job all year,\" Wilson said after the game. \"We felt really comfortable with him out there, the way he's been throwing the ball, especially in this series, and it was a good spot for him.\"Bazardo, for his part, had actually held righties to a lower OPS this season than Muñoz. And, to Wilson's point, Bazardo had appeared three times in the ALCS prior to Monday and had limited the Blue Jays to one run on three hits and four strikeouts. Those marks included an appearance in Sunday's Game 6, when he threw two scoreless innings. \nNotably, Bazardo faced Springer in that outing, throwing him two sinkers, with the second located in roughly the same spot as the one he homered against in Game 7.\"I mean, you make your decisions, and sometimes you have to live and die with it,\" Wilson said. \"I think, again, the way Bazardo has thrown the ball all season long, we were comfortable with where we were and it just, again, didn't go our way.\"\nIn turn, the Mariners will now head home for the winter, having come within a single win of reaching the World Series for the first time in franchise history.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        While Aaron Rodgers has acknowledged that Sunday night's game will be different, his former coach is treating the Green Bay Packers' showdown against Rodgers' Pittsburgh Steelers like any other game.Rodgers will face his former team for the first time when the Pittsburgh hosts Green Bay on prime time. Rodgers spent his first 18 seasons with the Packers that included the last four with LaFleur as his coach. \"We're playing the Pittsburgh Steelers who happen to have Aaron Rodgers,\" LaFleur said. \"I mean, it's as simple as that. That is for you guys to talk about. \"Granted, I mean, we've got a lot of respect and love for Aaron. What he's done here. He's a Hall of Famer. I know, like our past together, we had a lot of great moments, but this game is not about that. It's about going to Pittsburgh. 'Sunday Night Football.' Our guys will be jacked up. Their guys will be jacked up. It's about the Green Bay Packers versus the Pittsburgh Steelers. And that's for you guys to talk about all those other storylines.\" When asked if he will deliver the same message to his team, LaFleur pointed out that many of the current Packers didn't even play with Rodgers during his final years in Green Bay. \n\"I'm going talk about -- just like we do every week -- what is our blueprint and what are our keys in order to go to Pittsburgh, which is a damn good football team, and a really tough, hostile environment, and try to play our best, because we haven't ... to date,\" LaFleur said. \"We've got a lot of work to do.\" \n        \n            \n                NFL Week 8 early odds: Aaron Rodgers, Steelers home underdogs vs. Packers; Colts 14.5-point favorite vs. rival\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nRodgers aside, Sunday is big game for both teams from a positioning standpoint. Pittsburgh (4-2) is currently 1.5 games ahead of Cincinnati in the AFC North standings. Green Bay (4-1-1) had a slight lead over Detroit (4-2) entering the Lions' Monday night game against the Buccaneers. Like LaFleur, Rodgers is surely more focused on facing Green Bay's defense than he is about facing his former team. But unlike LaFleur, Rodgers -- who is already 1-0 this season against his former teams -- has openly admitted that Sunday night's game will undoubtedly be different. Rodgers did so when asked how it felt to face the Jets shortly following Pittsburgh's Week 1 win. \n\"It doesn't come close to how it's gonna feel playing Green Bay, because that was 18 years of my career,\" said Rodgers, who is hoping to join former teammate Brett Favre as former Packers legends who were able to beat their former team. \n            ",

    "body": "\nFormer Tampa Bay Buccaneers All-Pro running back and Boise State star Doug Martin died while in police custody following a struggle with officers who were investigating a break-in at a home in Oakland, California, on Sunday according to the Oakland Police Department. Martin, 36, became unresponsive after his arrest and was transported to the hospital after receiving medical aid on the scene. A cause of death has not been released, though the Alameda County Coroner's Office will do an autopsy to determine what happened.A first-round pick by Tampa Bay in the 2012 NFL Draft, Martin played seven seasons in the pros prior to his career ending after a brief stint with the Oakland Raiders.Oakland police said Monday that Martin \"was involved in a break-in at a residence in Oakland,\" and as officers were attempting to detain him, a \"brief struggle occurred\" with Martin becoming unresponsive after being taken into custody.\"Paramedics responded to the scene, provided medical aid, and transported Martin to a local hospital, where he later died,\" police said. \"Since Saturday, OPD has been in contact with Martin's family. The family has requested privacy as they grieve this tragic loss. No additional details are being released at this time, as this remains an ongoing investigation.\"The officers involved in the incident have been placed on paid administrative leave.Athletes First and agency CEO Brian Murphy, who represented Martin, released an additional statement on behalf of his family. Within the statement, it was revealed that Martin battled menal health challenges \"that profoundly impacted his personal and professional life.\"\"Ultimately, mental illness proved to be the one opponent from which Doug could not run,\" the statement continued. \"Following recent media reports about Doug's untimely passing, the family wishes to clarify the circumstances. Doug's parents were actively seeking medical assistance for him and had contacted local authorities for support. Feeling overwhelmed and disoriented, Doug fled his home during the night and entered a neighbor's residence two doors down, where he was taken into custody by police.\"Martin rushed for 1,454 yards as a rookie in 2012 before playing in only 17 games over his next two years with the Buccaneers. Martin's resurgence was notable in 2015 when he posted an All-Pro and Pro Bowl season in which he rushed for 1,402 yards. \nThat offseason, Tampa Bay signed Martin to a five-year, $35 million contract extension. He struggled thereafter for the NFC South franchise with a suspension for violating the NFL's substance abuse policy causing him to miss multiple games at the end of the year. The suspension came amid Martin being benched while the Buccaneers were making a playoff push during the 2016 season. The franchise released Martin after the 2017 season, and he later signed with the Raiders to back up Marshawn Lynch.Known for his bruising style at 5-feet-9 and 225 pounds, Martin starred at Boise State and earned the nickname \"Muscle Hamster\" during his time on the blue turf. \nPrior to Heisman finalist Ashton Jeanty's career, Martin was considered one of the top ballcarriers in program history after ranking third all-time at the school with 43 rushing touchdowns and 48 total touchdowns, fifth with 3,431 yards and sixth with 617 rushing attempts.\n            ",

He is now listed among the top contenders to win the 2025 NFL MVP award. See who else to roster here.Part of Kaylor's optimal NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering Lions running back Jahmyr Gibbs.

In 2024, he rushed 250 times for 1,412 yards and scored 16 rushing touchdowns, while also adding 52 receptions for 517 yards and four receiving touchdowns. That performance earned him a second Pro Bowl nod and established him as one of the league's most efficient all-purpose backs. Through the early part of 2025, he has continued to produce, carrying the ball 87 times for 390 yards (4.5 yards per carry) and finding the end zone four times, while adding 23 receptions for 112 yards. While his per-carry average dipped slightly compared to 2024, his explosiveness and versatility continue to define his value to the Lions' offense. You can see the rest of Kaylor's NFL DFS picks here.New users can see the latest FanDuel promo code to get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:How to build NFL DFS lineups for Monday Night FootballKaylor is also targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Monday Night Football.'

    "description": "\n        PHILADELPHIA -- Desperate times call for desperate measures. Brandon Graham is returning to the Philadelphia Eagles, sources confirmed to CBS",
    "body": "\n        PHILADELPHIA -- Desperate times call for desperate measures. Brandon Graham is returning to the Philadelphia Eagles, sources confirmed to CBS Sports, seven months after the 37-year-old, two-time Super Bowl champion retired from the league. Graham has been in discussions with the Eagles about coming back to help a pass rush that is in dire need of help, as the Eagles ranked 29th in the NFL in sack percentage (4.3%) and 26th in sacks (11.0). Graham will officially announce his return Tuesday morning.\nThe edge rushers have combined for 3.5 sacks through seven games, with Za'Darius Smith the leader in the clubhouse with 1.5 sacks. Smith retired from the NFL last week after only playing five games with the Eagles, and he wasn't on the roster Week 1. Josh Uche and Patrick Johnson are the only other Eagles edge rushers with sacks (1.0 each), showcasing how depleted the position is. To make matters worse, the Eagles have plenty of injuries at edge rusher. Nolan Smith and Ogbo Okoronkwo are on injured reserve with triceps injuries with Okoronkwo ruled out for the season. Azeez Ojulari also left Sunday's win over the Minnesota Vikings with a hamstring injury.For those counting at home, the Eagles have just three healthy edge rushers on the roster: Uche, Johnson and Jalyx Hunt. They need Graham back just for depth, even if he's not the answer to a bigger problem. \nWhat can Graham actually provide for Eagles? In short, who knows? Graham played through a torn triceps injury in Super Bowl LIX, the same injury he suffered in November of what was his final season. Graham won't be judged on his performance on the field, but what he brings to the locker room in veteran experience.The Eagles had that with Za'Darius Smith prior to his sudden retirement, as Smith actually occupied Graham's locker. With that locker vacant, Graham will fill the role as veteran mentor and leader. \"His locker will be ready,\" said Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts to reporters following his press conference after Sunday's win over the Vikings. \nThe Eagles just need bodies at edge rusher at this stage of the season until Nolan Smith returns, which is expected to be sometime after the bye week (Week 9). They're depleted at the position, so Graham returning and taking snaps on Sunday against the New York Giants would be a net positive. Graham coming out of retirement after a Super Bowl championship where he could walk into the sunset is unorthodox, but not unprecedented. The Eagles could use another player on the edge just to help out what they currently have on the active roster.Adding Graham doesn't mean the Eagles are done at edge rusher. Far from it. Who can Eagles target at edge rusher?There are certainly some edge rushers who will be available at the trade deadline, and the Eagles have plenty of premium draft capital to acquire one. The Eagles have 10 draft picks available in the 2026 NFL Draft.\nEagles' 2026 draft picksRoundAcquired1Own2Own3Own3From Jets3Projected compensatory4Own4Projected compensatory5Conditional (from 49ers)5Projected compensatory6From VikingsThe Eagles have five picks in the first three rounds and seven in the first four rounds, allowing them to afford parting ways with a pick or two to get a premium edge rusher. While the Eagles would prefer to keep their picks for future assets, the point of having premium draft picks is to make a Super Bowl contending roster better at the trade deadline.This is what the Eagles have to do if they wish to repeat as Super Bowl champions, as the pass rush played a major part in winning Super Bowl LIX. What the Eagles currently have at edge rusher isn't cutting it, so here are some candidates who could fill a void. \nTrey Hendrickson is the premier edge rusher available, and the Bengals are not out of the AFC North race as of yet. Cincinnati may not actually trade Hendrickson unless they get an offer they can't pass up. Hendrickson has a 14.5% pressure rate with 4.0 sacks on the season, and he's coming off consecutive 17.0-sack seasons. Adding Hendrickson would arguably place the Eagles as the best team in the NFC, even with their struggles on both sides of the ball. \nThe Dolphins are in a free fall as they have already had conversations about Mike McDaniel's future. They will be sellers at the deadline, and have a few players available. Jaelan Phillips is in the fifth-year option of his rookie deal, so he'll be a free agent after the season. Phillips has a 16.7% pressure rate this season with 2.0 sacks and 22 pressures. He would be bolstered depth for an Eagles pass rush that needs good players. Phillips has also played one season under Eagles defensive coordinator Vic Fangio, having 27 pressures, 6.5 sacks, and a 13.6% pressure rate in eight games in 2023. \nAnother Dolphins player available at the deadline, the 29-year-old Bradley Chubb has an 11.5% pressure rate with 4.0 sacks and 15 pressures in seven games. A young pass rush (even with the addition of Graham), could use a veteran like Chubb -- who had 11.0 sacks, 70 pressures, and a 15.7% pressure rate in his year with Fangio. Chubb has two years and $61.7 million in cap money left on his deal, so acquiring him would be difficult. He still would benefit going back in Fangio's scheme, as he also played for the Eagles defensive coordinator with the Denver Broncos. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        FRISCO, Texas -- Fresh off the Dallas Cowboys' best defensive performance of the 2025 season in a 44-22 win over the Washington Commanders in Week 7, owner and general manager Jerry Jones promised reinforcements were on the way.\"We got a chance to evolve into the kind of team that our fans deserve,\" Jones said after the game.That wasn't simply Jones trying to stir the pot. Electrifying Cowboys linebacker DeMarvion Overshown tweeted \"T-21\" on Monday, indicating that his 21-day practice window -- which gives teams three weeks to decide whether to activate a player or move him to season-ending injured reserve -- had opened. That timeline suggests Overshown could return after the team's Week 10 bye for Week 11 at the Las Vegas Raiders on \"Monday Night Football.\"Overshown tore his ACL for the second time in his career on Thanksgiving last season. Cowboys head coach Brian Schottenheimer confirmed that Overshown's window had opened, along with those for third-round rookie cornerback Shavon Revel Jr. (knee) and starting center Cooper Beebe (ankle). Wide receiver Jonathan Mingo (knee) will be activated this week from injured reserve. Beebe has been working in the rehab group at Dallas practice the past few weeks along with Overshown and Revel.\n\"Don't predict they're all playing, but again, we're excited to get those guys back. They've worked so hard. Demo [Overshown] and Von [Revel] and really all the guys have worked so hard to get back that I'm excited to get them out there. But we'll be smart, and we'll ramp them up and see how they do\"Here's the outlook for Overshown and Revel this season, plus an update on defensive tackle Kenny Clark, who suffered an elbow injury on Sunday.\nOvershown is working his way back from his second major knee injury after tearing his ACL in the 2023 preseason as a rookie. He's ahead of schedule in his rehab after saying during organized team activities that his target return date was Thanksgiving. Schottenheimer said he's been impressed by Overshown's growth on the mental side during his recovery.\n\"I think how much he's been around [defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus] 'Flus and how he sits right in front of the meetings. As I've been sitting in the [defensive] meetings, he sits right in front, and he's got sunglasses on, which is kind of cool. I can't pull that off. I try,\" Schottenheimer said.\"He's intent. You hear him wanting to answer all the questions when they're asking another guy. You see him kind of mouthing the answer. I think it's the understanding of he knows the physical part is going to take care of itself, but mentally and understanding the system and the calls: closed left, rock logs and all the different things that we do. The checks have to make versus certain formations, man, he's all into that. So I think as you mature as a player you understand that it's not just the movement skills and the ability to tackle and run guys down. It's the mental side. It's a chess match, and I think he's gotten older and wiser. I think he's really attacking the play.\"\nClark suffered an elbow injury on a three-yard touchdown run by Commanders running back Chris Rodriguez Jr. with 2:39 left in the third quarter. He was officially listed as questionable but returned with 11:13 remaining in the fourth. Clark generated five quarterback pressures on Sunday, tying his 2025 season high. His 23 pressures lead the Cowboys this year.\n\"I think he's going to be good,\" Schottenheimer said of Clark. \"He's tough as nails, and I thought he did a really good job yesterday affecting the quarterback from a pass-rush standpoint too. The push that he and Osa [Odighizuwa] got in the middle was good to see.\"\nEven after Dallas' best defensive outing of the year against Washington, the Cowboys still rank last in the NFL in pass defense, allowing 260.3 yards per game. Getting Revel back can only help Eberflus' maligned secondary.\"You've just seen it over the last couple of weeks working with [director of rehab] Britt [Brown] -- you've seen the confidence and the change of direction in the things that he's doing, which now makes us very comfortable opening his window and letting him go out there and play football, which he loves to do,\" Schottenheimer said. \"Again, it'll be mostly scout-team stuff probably this week. Let him run around and chase CeeDee and George and those guys around, see how he does. He's going to make mistakes, but I'm pretty sure that he's really, really good at football too. ... I'm proud of him.\"\nDallas has been eager to get its third-round pick on the field given the attrition at cornerback this season, especially with Pro Bowl corner Trevon Diggs having suffered a concussion. There's plenty of excitement around the building for when Revel finally suits up.\"The size [6-foot-1, 194 pounds] and the athleticism jumped off the film in college. I think that, again, he has the traits that we love in corners: they have length, they have competitive spirit, things like that,\" Schottenheimer said. \"I don't want to go too far over the top in my praise for Von because it's going to be a little bit of a process. I'm excited to get him out there on the grass, running around and chasing around some pretty good receivers.\"\n            ",

Rioux, who stands at 7-foot-9, became the tallest player in college basketball history -- at any level -- to score a basket. His lone points of the game came with 42 seconds remaining, when he threw down a two-handed flush.Rioux, 19, had previously appeared in two games this season for the reigning national champions. Rioux logged two minutes against North Florida last month and scored the first points of his college career against Merrimack two weeks later. The center from Canada logged three minutes in that game and went 1 of 2 from the free-throw line.Here is Rioux's basket against Saint Francis that made history.\nIn 2021, Guinness World Records declared Rioux the tallest teenager in the world at 7-foot-5. When he checked in against North Florida last month, he became the tallest college basketball player ever to appear in a game.\"It felt great,\" Rioux, who redshirted his first season with the Gators, said after his first career game. \"The support from everybody was amazing, even on the bench and even the fans. I think everybody supported me. I'm very grateful.\"\nRioux did not appear in a game during the 2024-25 campaign for the Gators. Florida has one of the deepest frontcourts in the nation, led by Thomas Haugh, Alex Condon, Micah Handlogten and Rueben Chinyelu. Although Rioux isn't part of the rotation yet, Wednesday was a positive sign for his overall development.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Fantasy Football is all about the matchups. Even though you drafted your team with certain hopes and intentions, your weekly lineup decisions shouldn't be determined by the order you picked your players in. You need to check who your players play and make sure you've got the right guys in -- and the wrong guys out.                  We can take some educated guesses based on coaches film, meaningful data, healthy personnel, defensive schemes, track records, and key details of offenses. The things we know can help us minimize the impact of the things we don't know. This should lead to better decisions being made.                   We'll go through every game and highlight the players who aren't obvious starts and sits (because you don't need to be told to start Brock Bowers). You should feel more comfortable starting or sitting players based on the information given, and feeling comfortable with your Fantasy lineup before the games start is the best feeling in the world.

Expect tight end Colby Parkinson to take on a bigger role, especially in the red zone, where he's already been crushing. His route rate started moving up in Week 10, and since then, he's averaged a 14.7% target share, which isn't great, but his overall red zone target share has been a huge 37.8%. He's run the second-most red-zone routes behind Adams, which suggests Parkinson will for sure be a fixture near the end zone like he has been in his past two (three total touchdowns) and past six (six total touchdowns). In 14 games, 11 tight ends have notched at least 10.1 PPR points against Seattle, including three with 11.1 or more in its past four games. Parkinson even scored on the Seahawks in Week 11, but had just two targets in the game. He should see more. There have been a number of psych-out tight ends who have hurt Fantasy managers, but unless you have a more reliable option, then Parkinson is worth taking the chance on. Another week, another weak game for Kenneth Walker III. In a more competitive-than-expected matchup, Walker played just 42% of the snaps versus the Colts, had one more carry than Zach Charbonnet (9 to 8), somehow had one more catch than Charbonnet (the only catch by a Seattle running back in the game), and averaged less than 3.0 yards per rush for the second game in a row. This Thursday's showdown could easily be competitive, but it could also be a runaway Rams win, and in either game script, I wouldn't feel good about Walker getting a lot of touches. The matchup is also really tough: L.A. has yielded 3.8 yards per carry, one rushing touchdown, and a minuscule 3.6% explosive rush rate over its past four games, excluding garbage time. And the added wrinkle of the Seahawks potentially playing without starting tackle Charles Cross against an aggressive Rams pass rush might take Walker off the field a little more since he's struggled in pass protection for much of this year and his career. I'd rather start Charbonnet because I think he'll play more and continue to see more high-value touches, but both backs are big-time risks.  MUST-STARTS: Matthew Stafford (top-10 QB, but not top-5), Puka Nacua, Jaxon Smith-Njigba\nSTARTS: Kyren Williams (No. 2 RB), Colby Parkinson (top-12 TE), Seahawks DST (low-end DST)FLEX: Zach Charbonnet, Kenneth Walker III (non-PPR)SITS: Sam Darnold, Blake Corum (desperation RB), A.J.

The Commanders are a nudge up in competition but still a unit void of defensive difference-makers, especially at this stage of the season. Washington's run defense is especially vulnerable, allowing 4.6 yards per rush and five rushing touchdowns (at least one per game) in its past four, excluding garbage time stats. And the Commanders were trounced by Saquon Barkley three times last season for at least 27 PPR points in each game. If the Eagles have another strong run game, then there's probably going to be more lean opportunities for their receivers. Additionally, tight end Dallas Goedert's newfound involvement in the offense (17 targets for a 14-148-2 stat line) in his past two games will also put a lid on DeVonta Smith and A.J. Brown's upside, even against a defense that shouldn't get a lot of pressure on Jalen Hurts unless his offensive line is down two more starters, which is possible. \nI wouldn't get too excited over Jacory Croskey-Merritt's Week 15. Running against the Giants was a good thing; running against the Eagles is a bad thing. Washington's running backs struggled for the most part in each of the three matchups against Philly last year: Austin Ekeler's 17.6 PPR game in Week 11 was helped by eight catches, Brian Robinson scored in a 14.2 PPR effort in the same game, and no other Eagles runner scored or even totaled 45 yards in any other game. Philly's run defense isn't even at full strength with Jalen Carter out, but it's still dominant enough to contain the Commanders RBs, which figures to include Chris Rodriguez Jr., who didn't play in the team's game last week. Expect a three-headed approach, which limits the upside of any rusher in a tough matchup, and if they're without left tackle Laremy Tunsil, then the matchup is even more unbearable. Marcus Mariota might lead Washington in rush yards. MUST-STARTS: Saquon Barkley, A.J.

The biggest? No Micah Parsons for the Packers, which means a good-but-not-as-good pass rush will be coming after Williams. That's an upgrade that a quarterback who's struggled with pass rush pressure all season really needs. Also not expected to play is Packers safety Evan Williams, a solid run defender and decent pass defender. Both of those absences should compel the Packers to play more zone coverage just as they have been in their past four matchups, and Williams' efficiency and accuracy have been much better against that coverage this season compared to man-to-man. He's not a top-12 quarterback in my rankings, but he's still in the conversation as a usable starter, though that outlook would be better if he had both Rome Odunze and Luther Burden to throw to.\nThe case to start D.J. Moore is easy as long as Rome Odunze and Luther Burden are sidelined: He'll be the Bears' No. 1 receiver, plus he's more efficient on a deeper average depth of target against zone coverage this year. Here's another reason: Moore has six red-zone targets in his past four games and got three end-zone targets last week. Both lead the team. The next-closest Bears player in both categories? Olamide Zaccheaus and Colston Loveland are tied with three red-zone targets in those past four, while Zaccheaus is tied with Cole Kmet with two end-zone targets. Loveland's route rate remains underwhelming as he's participated on more than 70% of the pass plays in just three games all year, a factor that's kept him from being a seven-target tight end instead of what he has been, which is roughly a five-target tight end. Even if Burden plays on Saturday, Moore is usable as at worst a high-end No. 3 receiver or flex. Loveland is a startable tight end, but all three of his games with 11-plus PPR points have involved at least one touchdown. Maybe it's good news then that he's literally the only tight end to score on the Packers since Week 8, but if he doesn't do it again, he'll leave your lineup a little light. MUST STARTS: Josh JacobsSTARTS: D'Andre Swift, DJ Moore, Colston Loveland (low-end TE)SITS: Caleb Williams (high-end No. 2 QB), Jordan Love, Kyle Monangai (desperation RB), Jayden Reed, Romeo Doubs, Dontayvion Wicks, Olamide Zaccheaus, Luke Musgrave, Cole Kmet, Bears DST, Packers DST\n                    \n                Start 'em\n            \n                \n            \n                10.0-7.00\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                6.99 - 5.01\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                5.00 - 0\n            \n        \n                    \n                Sit 'em\n            \n            \nThe Panthers run defense has bottomed out over its past four games, excluding garbage time, giving up 4.9 yards per rush, an 11% explosive rush rate, and seven rushing TDs to RBs (five inside the five). This should be huge for Bucky Irving (19, 17, and 17 touches in each game since returning from injury), but what if it's too good and leaves little for Baker Mayfield to do? Not only is that possible, but the Panthers have reliably played zone coverage (Cover-3 is their favorite) not just over the past month but much of the year, and also did in both games against Tampa Bay last season. Mayfield has been merely solid and not spectacular against zone coverage and Cover-3 this year, and that's what he figures to see a lot of this week. It's not a complicated matchup for Mayfield, but it could be one that keeps his numbers solid (250-2-0?). \nI'd expect the Buccaneers defense to play with a lot more intensity this week after their coach cursed out the team to the media after last week's embarrassing loss. Getting safety Tykee Smith and linebacker SirVocea Dennis back would also go a long way toward corralling the Panthers backs. I also didn't like how the Panthers offensive line appeared to wear down last week against the Saints; they have a more physically imposing matchup this week. Both Rico Dowdle and Chuba Hubbard make me nervous, but they'll participate in the passing game, which is where I suspect Carolina's offense will have to focus. In five games when Bryce Young has passed at least 30 times, Tetairoa McMillan has seen at least eight targets every time and 13.3 PPR points three times. Jalen Coker seems to be emerging as a savvy second receiver for the Panthers and could see north of five targets in such a game script. Both are in play as at least flex options. Young has two games with 20-plus Fantasy points in these five higher-for-him volume outings; I'm not sure this will be a third.

It doesn't guarantee Fantasy failure, but three of his five single-digit PPR point games did come in Bills blowout wins. What does concern me is the matchup against a Browns defense that plays a lot of man-to-man coverage and does get after the quarterback. Shakir's target per route run rate dips from a second-best 22.7% overall to a <i>fourth-best</i> 19.5% against man coverage. Shakir also averages 9.2 yards per catch against man compared to 11.4 versus zone, and it gets even lower (7.9) against Cover-1 schemes like the Browns prefer to play. Shakir has 11.5 PPR points or fewer in three straight, including a matchup versus the Bengals when he scored! I'd expect big numbers for James Cook and Josh Allen, but not Shakir.  No defense has allowed fewer Fantasy points per game than the Bills this season. Harold Fannin Jr. isn't your typical tight end -- he lines up wide and in the slot around 40% of his snaps -- and he's had at least six targets and at least 11.3 PPR points in 3 of 4 of Shedeur Sanders' starts. Only three tight ends all season have seen a minimum of five targets against the Bills: Travis Kelce, Cade Otton, and Mike Gesicki. All three played across the formation like Fannin. Two of them -- Kelce and Gesicki -- had at least 12.5 PPR points. Gesicki actually had 20.6 PPR points because he scored, one of two tight ends to do so against Buffalo this year. It's obviously a yucky matchup for Fannin, but his role as a short and intermediate target in the Browns offense is locked in. He should still see his targets and serve as at least a decent PPR tight end. It's those half- and non-PPR leagues I'd be nervous about.

Eleven of the past 13 QBs against the Chargers have recorded 19.1 or fewer Fantasy points in six-point pass TD formats (and just four of the 13 totaled two touchdowns). This is happening because the Chargers pass rush has begun kicking into high gear even without a heavy amount of blitzing, and the secondary continues to push along. The challenge for Dak Prescott is to manage that pass rush. When Prescott's pressured, the Cowboys, whose target per route run rates dip, are George Pickens (17.1%) and Jake Ferguson (16.6%). That was especially the case last week when the Vikings got in Prescott's kitchen a ton and both Pickens and Ferguson came up small. In the (almost) four games since left tackle Tyler Guyton's injury, Prescott has been above 20.4 Fantasy points once (versus the Chiefs). He's not a lock to play this week, nor is his backup tackle, Nate Thomas. If the Cowboys have any weakness on that O-line, it could mean another bad game for Prescott against a defense that's delivered a lot of them.MUST STARTS: CeeDee LambSTARTS: Dak Prescott (borderline No. 1/2 QB), Javonte Williams, George Pickens, Ladd McConkey (low-end No. 2 WR), Chargers DST (low-end DST)\nFLEX: Omarion HamptonSITS: Justin Herbert, Jake Ferguson (high-end No. 2 TE), Kimani Vidal (desperation RB), Oronde Gadsden II (desperation TE), Keenan Allen, Ryan Flournoy, Malik Davis, Cowboys DST\n                    \n                Start 'em\n            \n                \n            \n                10.0-7.00\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                6.99 - 5.01\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                5.00 - 0\n            \n        \n                    \n                Sit 'em\n            \n            \nMy study of Quinn Ewers before the NFL Draft revealed a quick-release thrower who could read coverages but had arm strength and accuracy issues when he threw beyond 10 air yards. Ewers also was inconsistent in dealing with pressure and seemed to have an over-reliance on screens, quick outs, flares, and check-down passes. This is all well and good for De'Von Achane, but it does create some concern for Jaylen Waddle and Darren Waller's efficiency. Waddle is especially a major concern: All 26 of his career touchdowns have come from Tua Tagovailoa, he has one career game with more than 85 receiving yards and four with more than 50 yards without Tagovailoa on the field, and he has just five games with five or more catches from a passer not named Tagovailoa.

The Broncos brought their mojo back last week with a more aggressive pass rush. Lawrence's efficiency has gone out the window when pressured this year, including a 6.9 yards per attempt average, a 3% TD rate and a 3% INT rate, a low 80.5% catchable pass rate, and a paltry 69.8 QB rating when the heat's been on him. In fact, in four games in 2025 when Lawrence has been pressured on at least 40% of his dropbacks, he's completed multiple touchdown passes once, totaled multiple touchdowns twice, scored 20-plus Fantasy points (six points per pass TD) twice,e and been below 20 points twice. None of that is great, and neither is this: Only one quarterback has gone into Denver and left with more than sixteen Fantasy points (Jaxson Dart had a monster game in Week 7). This is a tough spot for Lawrence, who has shined over the last month in matchups against the Cardinals, Titans, Colts, and Jets. The Broncos are a massive step up. Lawrence's floor is boosted by what he can do running the ball, something that figures to come into play this week and has helped other QBs against Denver, but it's a major risk to trust him in what's been a really tough matchup all year. Green Bay entered Week 15 with a dynamite pass rush and a track record of playing heavy zone coverage. Bo Nix crushed it, specifically getting 267 of his 302 yards and all four of his touchdowns against the Packers' zone coverage. While Jacksonville's pass rush is pretty good (16 sacks in its past five games), its pass defense is nowhere near as good as Green Bay's. In fact, their numbers have been propped up by the inferior passers and weak offensive lines they've dealt with. This should make for a fairly easy matchup for Nix to keep grinding, particularly against a defense that won't delve too deeply into anything different than what he saw last week. Here's another interesting point: Save for the Raiders game, the Broncos haven't been able to run the ball really efficiently. It could put more on Nix's plate, and although Nix has had a lot on his plate for much of the last month and still came up short, last week could have been the breakthrough.  STARTS: Bo Nix, Travis Etienne, R.J.

Jackson seemed panicky in the first half and then maybe too chill in the second half. There were some accuracy issues as well as some strange decision-making issues on a few occasions. There's a chance the Ravens simply run their way to another victory: The Patriots have let up 4.8 yards per rush, three rushing touchdowns (two last week), and a 5.9% explosive rush rate over their past four games, excluding garbage time. It's the perfect spot for the Ravens to stick with their newfound thunder-and-lightning combo of Derrick Henry and Keaton Mitchell, with Jackson utilizing some play-action and RPOs off of it. Tack on a Patriots pass rush that's struggled to wrangle quarterbacks all year, and it sets up for a decent spot, though wide receivers and tight ends not named Dawson Knox have come up small against the Pats in their past four. All of this might impact your expectations for Zay Flowers, even though he had a nice game last week.

    "body": "\n        The Chicago Bears have expanded their search for a new stadium site beyond the state of Illinois. In a letter sent to fans Wednesday, Bears president Kevin Warren said Northwest Indiana is among the locations the franchise will explore to build a new domed stadium.The franchise has spent several years searching for a location for a new home after more than 50 years playing at Chicago's Soldier Field. Initially, the Bears had hoped to build the stadium in the northwestern Chicago suburb of Arlington Heights. The franchise purchased the site in 2023, but Warren said in his letter that Illinois state leaders have told him the project is not a priority for 2026. The Bears did not ask for taxpayer dollars to build the stadium, but wanted an infrastructure commitment for roads and utilities. \n        \n            \n                Prisco's Week 16 NFL picks: Seahawks top Rams on 'TNF,' Packers edge Bears, Jaguars upset Broncos\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"Stable  timelines are critical, as are predictable processes and elected   leaders, who share a sense of urgency and appreciation for public   partnership that projects with this level of impact require,\" Warren wrote. \"We have not   received that sense of urgency or appreciation to date. We have been   told directly by State leadership, our project will not be a priority in   2026, despite the benefits it will bring to Illinois.\"Warren's solution: a potential move to Northwest Indiana. The Indiana border is approximately 15 miles from Soldier Field, but having the team not only play outside the city of Chicago, but outside the state of Illinois altogether would be a controversial move.\n\"Consequently,  in addition to Arlington Park, we need to expand our  search and  critically evaluate opportunities throughout the wider  Chicagoland  region, including Northwest Indiana,\" the letter continued. \"This is not about  leverage. We  spent years trying to build a new home in Cook County. We  invested  significant time and resources evaluating multiple sites and  rationally  decided on Arlington Heights. Our fans deserve a world-class  stadium.  Our players and coaches deserve a venue that matches the  championship  standard they strive for every day. With that in mind, our  organization  must keep every credible pathway open to deliver that  future.\"Warren had hoped to finalize the Arlington Heights stadium's construction plans in September, so they could bid for a Super Bowl by 2031. \nThe Bears, whose lease at Soldier Field runs through 2033, are in the midst of their best season since going 12-4 in 2018. At 10-4, the Bears are in first place in the NFC North and have a chance to gain some separation in a massive divisional showdown with the Green Bay Packers (9-4-1) at Soldier Field on Saturday night. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Tennessee Titans will soon be looking for their next head coach, and Cam Ward wants to play a role in the process. Tennessee's rookie quarterback said that he is eager to help the Titans during the hiring process. The Titans are in this position after firing Brian Callahan after their 1-5 start. Tennessee has gone 1-7 with Mike McCoy serving as interim coach. \"I want to meet all of them,\" Ward said Wednesday. \"Every coach who's going to get the opportunity to come here, I want to meet them and have conversations throughout the whole process with them. That's someone I'm going to be here with for that time.\"Ward, the Titans' No. 1 pick in the 2025 draft, said that president of football operations Chad Brinker and general manager Mike Borgonzi have already spoken to him regarding his potential involvement in the search. \"They know how much I want to be involved. Not even with the scheme part of it, just, as the head coach, who he is on an every day basis,\" Ward said. \n\n        \n            \n                Prisco's Week 16 NFL picks: Seahawks top Rams on 'TNF,' Packers edge Bears, Jaguars upset Broncos\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWard added that he'll be all-in on whoever the Titans' next coach is regardless of where his expertise lies. Callahan was an offensive-minded coach who had a successful tenure as the Cincinnati Bengals' offensive coordinator prior to coming to Nashville. Mike Vrabel, Callahan's predecessor in Tennessee and the New England Patriots' current coach, has a defensive background that includes a 14-year NFL career as a linebacker. Ward was highly supportive of Callahan during their brief time together. But despite their harmonious working relationship, the two spent just six games together as Callahan was fired after going 3-14 in 2024 and losing five of his first six games this season. The Titans' recent struggles don't all fall on Callahan. After earning the AFC's top playoff spot in 2021, the franchise made a series of missteps that has led to its current predicament. Among those mistakes was trading wideout A.J. Brown to the Eagles and using the first-round pick acquired in that trade to select Treylon Burks, who caught just 53 passes during his three seasons with the team. \nWard's desire to help the Titans find their next coach is clearly a sign of his determination to help his team turn the corner. While it's been a trying time for the franchise, Ward clearly wants to play a sizable role in the turnaround, both on the field and off of it. \n            ",

    "body": "\nJaxon Smith-Njigba is having a historic season for the Seattle Seahawks, and he'll be a focal point in arguably the biggest game in the NFC West this season when they host the Los Angeles Rams for Thursday Night Football. First place in the division will be on the line, and Smith-Njigba had nine catches for 105 yards in Seattle's first meeting with Los Angeles, but failed to get into the endzone in a 21-19 defeat. However, he's scored at least once in seven of his last 11 games, and he's priced at +115 in the latest Seahawks vs. Rams anytime touchdown scorer odds from DraftKings. That's why he's one of the SportsLine Projection Model's top TNF anytime TD scorer picks.\nTargeting NFL player props is one way to approach NFL odds at online sports betting sites for Thursday Night Football in Week 16. With NFL props available for almost every player in Rams vs. Seahawks at top online sportsbooks, SportsLine's proven computer model can help you find value to add to your Seattle vs. Los Angeles NFL picks. New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters Week 16 on a sizzling 52-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns. Now, it has revealed its top anytime touchdown picks for Seahawks vs. Rams.Best Thursday Night Football anytime TD prop picks:Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Seahawks (+115)Zach Charbonnet, Seahawks (+170)Blake Corum, Rams (+240)\nJaxon Smith-Njigba, Seahawks (+115)In addition to having a fighting chance of breaking Calvin Johnson's record for receiving yards in a single season (1,964), Smith-Njigba leads Seattle with nine touchdowns this year. Despite only playing in 74.8% of Seattle's offensive sets this season (44th among qualifying WRs), Smith-Njigba leads the NFL with a 35.0% target share, and his 23 deep targets (20 yards or more) also leads the league. The model predicts that he scores 0.54 touchdowns on average, while these odds imply a 46.5% chance to find the endzone.\nZach Charbonnet, Seahawks (+170)Charbonnet and Kenneth Walker III continue to split time in the Seattle backfield, and Walker has probably been the more efficient Seahawks running back this season. However, Charbonnet has been the preferred goal-to-go option and has scored seven of his eight touchdowns on the year from inside the 10-yard line. He's scored in seven of Seattle's 13 games this season, so finding significantly plus-money odds here is a potential boon. The model predicts 0.48 TDs on average, while the odds imply a 37% chance to score.\nBlake Corum, Rams (+240)Kyren Williams is still one of the most effective running backs in the NFL, but Blake Corum has forced his way into a more meaningful role in Sean McVay's offense. He's carried the ball 30 times for 280 yards and four touchdowns in his last three games and his snap share rose to a season-high 45.8% last week against the Lions. Corum has even pilfered some of the goal-to-go work that Williams has dominated this season, scoring three short-yardage touchdowns and five overall. The model predicts 0.30 touchdowns on average, while the odds suggest a 29.4% chance to score.\nWant more Thursday Night Football picks?You've seen the model's NFL anytime touchdown prop picks for several players in Rams vs. Seahawks.

    "body": "\n        The final three weeks of the 2025 NFL regular season are upon us, so naturally the remaining games come with plenty of weight to them. As many as nine teams can clinch playoff spots in Week 16. The Denver Broncos can actually clinch the AFC's No. 1 overall seed this week with a victory, a Los Angeles Chargers loss or tie, a New England Patriots loss and a Buffalo Bills loss or tie. It's been 21 years since a team won the NFC East in consecutive seasons, but the Philadelphia Eagles can end that streak with a victory over the Washington Commanders on Saturday or a Dallas Cowboys loss against the Chargers on Sunday. The focus is certainly football, but it's impossible to fully analyze how teams are playing at this point in the year without factoring in injuries. Every team is banged up to a certain degree, which could play a not insignificant role in how the rest of the season unfolds. With most teams returning to the practice field for the first time this week on Wednesday, we'll take a survey around the league as teams publish their initial injury reports. We'll also analyze the final injury report for Thursday night's critical NFC West showdown between the 11-3 Los Angeles Rams and the 11-3 Seattle Seahawks. \nAll NFL odds via DraftKings Sportsbook.Los Angeles Rams at Seattle Seahawks (-1.5)Thursday, 8:15 p.m. ET | Stream on Prime VideoLos Angeles Rams: WR Davante Adams (knee/hamstring) DOUBTFUL, DE Braden Fiske (ankle) QUESTIONABLESeattle Seahawks: LT Charles Cross (hamstring) OUTLos Angeles Rams wide receiver Davante Adams departed the team's 41-34 Week 15 win over the Detroit Lions with a non-contact hamstring injury, and that injury has him listed as doubtful to suit up in what's seemingly an NFC West division title championship game of sorts. Adams leads the league with 14 receiving touchdowns this season, and if he doesn't play, that will be a tremendous loss for quarterback Matthew Stafford and head coach Sean McVay. Edge rusher Braden Fiske (ankle) is questionable after also not practicing all week like Adams.The Seattle Seahawks will be without starting left tackles Charles Cross (hamstring) on Thursday night, a huge blow for quarterback Sam Darnold, who threw four interceptions in a 21-19 Week 11 road loss at the Rams. Josh Jones, a 2020 third-round pick by the Seahawks, will be making his first start since Week 3 of the 2023 season, a 37-17 road win at the Jacksonville Jaguars, in place of Cross. \nPhiladelphia Eagles at Washington Commanders (+6.5) (Saturday)Four Philadelphia Eagles didn't practice on Wednesday: defensive tackle Jalen Carter (shoulders), left guard Landon Dickerson (calf/vet rest day), offensive tackle Fred Johnson (ankle) and right tackle Lane Johnson (foot).

    "body": "\n        A fresh take on exhibition golf will take place under the lights on Wednesday when Scottie Scheffler, Rory McIlroy and their respective squads face off against one another at Trump National Golf Club. Dubbed the 2025 Golf Channel Games, the exhibition will see two teams of four compete in a series of fun, fast-paced events designed to mimic challenges from other sports leagues.Scheffler and McIlroy teamed up victoriously this time last year in Las Vegas for an exhibition match against LIV Golf members Brooks Koepka and Bryson DeChambeau, but this time, they will be on opposite sides.The two teams will traverse through a series of five challenges -- timed driving, timed short game, timed relay, 14-club challenge and finally a head-to-head matchup between Scheffler and McIlroy where they will strike shots from specific areas against one another. Whichever team garners the most points will win the overall competition.Golf Channel Games teamsEach team features a good friend to the de facto captain, a familiar face from the Ryder Cup and somewhat of a wild card selection.\nRory McIlroyScottie SchefflerShane LowrySam BurnsLuke DonaldKeegan BradleyHaotong LiLuke ClantonGolf Channel Games formatTimed drive competition: Players compete head-to-head with two minutes on the clock, launching drives onto a scoring grid. Timed short-game competition: This consists of individual action with players chipping the ball within a certain distance of the pin and holing out a specific number of putts at a distance, all with 3 minutes set on the clock.Team relay: Strategy will be crucial here as each team of four will play alternate shot across three holes. Teammates will be staged in certain positions -- one on the tee, one in the fairway, two on and around the greens -- and whichever side finishes with the best score in the shortest amount of time wins.14-club challenge: Two players will compete head-to-head. The groups of two will pull clubs from the same golf bag and strike shots from predetermined distances in the fairway during a closest-to-the-pin contest. Once a club is used, it is eliminated, meaning each player will strike seven different shots with all 14 clubs used. All eight players in the competition will compete across four head-to-head matchups.Captain's challenge: McIlroy and Scheffler will battle head-to-head. Each player will strike shots from various distances, a bunker, greenside and putts of 30 feet and 10 feet. Whomever has the lowest combined distance from the hole for the shots will win.Where to watch Golf Channel gamesDate: Wednesday, Dec. 17 | Start time: 7:30 p.m. ET Course: Trump National Golf Club — Jupiter, FloridaTV: Golf Channel, USA NetworkStreaming: Fubo (Try for free)\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe Los Angeles Rams have their fate in their own hands when it comes to a second straight NFC West title -- and the No. 1 seed in the conference. The same can be said of the Seattle Seahawks in regard to the division crown, but their road is much more difficult.Los Angeles has the same 11-3 record as Seattle but currently occupies first place in the NFC West by virtue of its 21-19 home triumph in the rivals' first meeting of the season in Week 11. The Rams wrap up the 2025 NFL regular season with matchups against the Atlanta Falcons (5-9) and Arizona Cardinals (3-11), while the Seahawks take on the Carolina Panthers (7-7) and San Francisco 49ers (10-4), meaning it is of the utmost importance that they win their showdown with the Rams at 8:15 p.m. ET on Thursday Night Football at Lumen Field.The Rams are coming off their eighth win in nine games, a 41-34 triumph over the Detroit Lions in Week 15. Matthew Stafford added to his MVP resume by throwing a pair of touchdown passes to increase his NFL-leading total to 37 and posting his third 300-yard performance of the season with 368 yards as he ranks second in the league with 3,722.Kyren Williams also was a big contributor against the Lions, rushing for 78 yards and two touchdowns. The 25-year-old has found the end zone at least once in six of his last seven games, including Los Angeles' first meeting with Seattle on Nov. 16 when he gained 91 yards on only 12 carries.The Seahawks also have won eight of their last nine and extended their streak to four straight victories with last week's 18-16 triumph over the Indianapolis Colts. All of Seattle's offense against Indianapolis came from Jason Myers, who converted all six of his field-goal attempts, including a 56-yarder with 18 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter.Wideout Jaxon Smith-Njigba, who leads the NFL with 1,541 receiving yards, finished the win with 113 on seven catches for his ninth 100-yard effort of the year. One of those came against the Rams in Week 11, when he hauled in nine passes for 105 yards in that contest. However, Sam Darnold struggled in the matchup as he matched his career high with four interceptions and failed to throw a touchdown pass.\nThe Rams already have secured a trip to the postseason and would strengthen their chances for both their 16th NFC West title and a first-round bye with a victory on Thursday. In addition to currently owning the tiebreaker against Seattle, Los Angeles is one game ahead of the Chicago Bears in the race for the top spot in the conference, which would mark the fourth time it has accomplished the feat.A victory would seal up a playoff berth for the Seahawks and put them in the driver's seat for what would be their 12th overall division title and 10th NFC West crown. It also would give them the inside track to finish with the No. 1 seed for the fourth time in franchise history.SportsLine's Inside the Lines team currently believes Los Angeles has the better chance at winning the NFC West. According to the ITL team's model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, the Rams have a 56% chance to capture the division title as they enter Thursday night's showdown, and it would increase to nearly 89% with a victory against the Seahawks but would drop to less than 24% with a loss.The model says the Seahawks' prospects to win the division are at nearly 31.5% right now and jump to just under 60% with a win over the Rams. However, a loss would give them only a 3% chance to finish atop the NFC West.CHANCES OF WINNING NFC WESTTEAMCURRENTWITH WEEK 16 WINWITH WEEK 16 LOSSDIFFERENCELos Angeles Rams56.0%88.7%23.4%65.3%Seattle Seahawks31.4%59.8%3.0%56.8%Considering the remaining schedule for both teams, it is imperative for the Seahawks to defeat the Rams for just the second time in their last six meetings both overall and in Seattle. When the clubs met at Lumen Field last season, Smith-Njigba made his second touchdown catch of the game with 51 seconds left in the fourth quarter to help forge a tie before Stafford threw his second TD pass of the contest midway through overtime to give Los Angeles a 26-20 victory.The Rams have the NFL's second-leading receiver in Puka Nacua (1,367 yards), although they may be without wideout Davante Adams, who leads the league with 14 touchdown receptions but is battling a hamstring injury. Seattle is a 1.5-point favorite against Los Angeles in the latest odds at DraftKings, and the ITL team's model is projecting a 23-22 victory for the Seahawks.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Following his team's 128-125 overtime loss to the Denver Nuggets, Ime Udoka took aim at the officials. The Houston Rockets coach had some strong words for the referees in that contest, and it cost him a pretty penny.The NBA announced Wednesday that it fined Udoka $25,000 for \"public criticism\" of the officiating. That may seem like a lot, but Udoka did get his money's worth after a key loss that had a notable impact on the Western Conference standings. He certainly didn't hesitate to torch the crew of Zach Zarba (crew chief), Natalie Sago and JD Ralls.\"Just in general, I think as poorly officiated a game I've seen in a long time,\" Udoka said. \"Two have no business being out there and the crew chief was acting star struck. So, you're seeing all kinds of inconsistent calls and I'm sure we should've gotten a few more techs.\"The win kept Denver in second in the West, while the loss dropped Houston all the way to the fifth spot in the extremely competitive top of the standings. \nThere were a number of calls during the game that Udoka wasn't pleased with, but the most controversial one came in the closing seconds when Amen Thompson got called for a foul after he and Tim Hardaway Jr. got their legs tangled up. Udoka challenged the call, thinking surely it'd be overturned on review for incidental contact, but Zarba upheld the foul, citing contact between Thompson's shin and Hardaway's leg that caused him to go to the ground. \nThat gave Denver one free throw and the ball in a one-point game, with Jamal Murray sinking the free throw to tie the game and force overtime -- after Nikola Jokić rimmed out a game-winning 3-point attempt. In overtime, the Nuggets darted out to a quick lead and never relinquished it, with some more calls and no-calls down the stretch that frustrated the Rockets. After the way the game ended, Udoka wasn't in much of a mood to hold back on officiating he felt wasn't up to the level of the basketball being played. You don't often hear a coach say two refs flat out shouldn't be out there, and doing that while also calling Zarba \"star struck\" in the way he called the game for Jokić will certainly not sit well with the league. \nA fine is almost assuredly coming for Udoka, but he wanted to deliver a message to his team that they don't need to change the way they play because of how that game was officiated, telling the Rockets, \"Keep being who we are, we're not going to adjust to poor officials.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        One day after Miami Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel said \"everything is on the table\" regarding benching Tua Tagovailoa, McDaniel followed through. With Miami officially eliminated from playoff contention, rookie quarterback Quinn Ewers will start for the Dolphins in Week 16 against the Cincinnati Bengals, McDaniel told reporters Wednesday.Zach Wilson will be Ewers' primary backup; Tagovailoa will be the emergency third-string quarterback.\"The decision is complicated but simple,\" McDaniel said Wednesday. \"The simple piece is I think Quinn gives this team the best chance to win. Our focus is, obviously, to win the next three games, but in particular, like I told the players, we are focused on beating the Bengals, so that was the motivation.\"McDaniel said the decision \"wasn't easy for [Tagovailoa] to hear\" but that he \"exhibited what makes him a captain and a leader on this team.\"\n\n        \n            \n                Tua's ride is over: Dolphins staring down an expensive divorce as they turn -- for now -- to Quinn Ewers\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTagovailoa, 27, went 22 for 28 for 253 yards, two touchdowns and an interception and took four sacks in Miami's 28-15 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers on Monday night, but the box score doesn't reflect how poorly he played. Both touchdowns came after the game had already gotten well out of hand. Through three quarters, he recorded just 65 passing yards and an interception.\"Well I think the quarterback play last night was not good enough, and so for me, everything is on the table,\" McDaniel said Tuesday.In 14 games, Tagovailoa completed 67.7% of his passes for 2,660 yards, 20 touchdowns and a league-leading 15 interceptions, which also marks a career high. The Dolphins won four straight games entering the \"Monday Night Football\" contest against the Steelers, but that had often been in spite of Tagovailoa, who only threw three touchdown passes with three interceptions over that span.\nTagovailoa said he and McDaniel had a brief conversation Wednesday and said he was \"disappointed\" to hear of his demotion.\"I would say the biggest thing, and it's being honest with myself as well, has been my performance,\" Tagovailoa said. \"I haven't been performing up to the level or the capabilities that I have in the past.\"Tagovailoa said injuries have not played a role in his poor performance and added that his job, even as a backup, is to help the team win games. Asked about his future with the Dolphins -- a decision that has quickly come into view with this move -- Tagovailoa said he can only control what he can control.\nTagovailoa signed a four-year, $212.4 million contract extension with $167 million in guarantees in July 2024. Moving on from Tagovailoa this offseason would be difficult for Miami. The former No. 5 overall pick is signed through 2028, and he carries a $56.4 million cap hit in 2026. Still, his benching could mark the beginning of the end of the Tagovailoa era in Miami.And Tagovailoa might not be the only notable player from the last few seasons moving on. Tyreek Hill, who suffered a season-ending knee injury in late September, reacted to Tagovailoa's benching with a viral GIF of a man disappearing.\nCBS Sports' Jonathan Jones had previously reported the Dolphins are expected to move on from Hill after this season.\n            ",

College football bowl season provides an opportunity for fan bases to see their team one last time and get a sneak peek into the future as younger players get into the game. The bowl schedule kicked off Saturday, Dec. 13 and goes all the way until Jan. 2. The College Football Playoff carries us from there to Jan. 19, when two teams will vie for a national championship in Miami Gardens, Florida. CBS will once again broadcast the Tony the Tiger Sun Bowl. Kick is set for 2 p.m. on Dec. 31 in El Paso, Texas. Additionally, Dec. 27 is one of the most stacked days of the year as eight bowl games will take place on that day, including the Pop-Tarts Bowl, Texas Bowl and Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl Presented By Gin & Juice By Dre and Snoop (yes, that's its official name). \n\n        \n            \n                College Football Playoff bracket: Indiana, Ohio State, Georgia, Texas Tech earn byes; Miami in over Notre Dame\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBelow is a detailed look at the complete schedule for the 2025-26 college football bowl season, including dates, locations and TV channels.

Sanders recently delivered a 364-yard, three-touchdown against the Tennessee Titans, but Sunday's mistake-filled loss to the Chicago Bears was humbling for the rookie.Sanders gleamed from a previous conversation with Jameis Winston that numbers are meaningless compared to wins and losses.\"I talked to Jameis a couple weeks ago after he threw for some crazy yards, but he said the most important thing is the wins,\" Sanders said. \"Having that guidance and having that knowledge from a vet like him truly helped me understand it a little bit more. I always knew, of course, winning was the final goal. That's what everybody in this league tries to do, so you just got to focus on that.\"Sanders, a fifth-round selection, became the Browns starter for the rest of the season. He is 1-3 as a starter since Dillon Gabriel suffered a concussion in Week 11 against the Baltimore Ravens.\n\"He's a young player that is making progress, like we've talked about all week,\" Browns coach Kevin Stefanski said after his team's loss to the Bears. \"I see it in games. I get to see it in practice. There's going to be ups and downs to young players, particularly the quarterback position. So we'll learn from it, and we'll be better next week.\"Since struggling in his debut, Sanders showed signs of improvement prior to his three-interception performance. He led the Browns to a Nov. 23 win over the Las Vegas Raiders with 209 yards passing and a touchdown. And the aforementioned three-touchdown stat line against the Titans during a 31-29 loss flexed growth.\n\"In every situation, it's always going to be things you want to work on and get better,\" Sanders said after Sunday's loss. \"I think that's where I'm heading. I'm in the learning and understanding phase of his time and how things are.\"\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\nSportsLine NFL expert Jeff Hochman's system paid off in Week 14, with the New Orleans Saints and Las Vegas Raiders covering the spread, and he hit one of two in Week 15. The Houston Texans blew out the Arizona Cardinals, who were giving 9.5 points, but the Washington Commanders beat the New York Giants as 2.5-point underdogs. Hochman has lined up another system for Week 16 of the 2025 NFL season and identified two spots bettors can target.NFL teams bouncing back after shutout lossesWin Rate: 31-12-4 ATS (72.1%)Sample Size: Since 2011Criteria: Teams scoring zero points in the prior weekEdge: Non-Division games; Week 11 or laterWhy does this work?This system looks at teams that didn't score the previous week and were playing a non-divisional team in Week 11 or later. In this spot, teams have covered the spread 31 times in 47 tries, winning by an average of 1.8 points. After being shut out, teams usually make changes -- like tweaking their offensive strategy, shuffling the lineup or focusing on fundamentals in practice. Players and coaches want to show that last week's zero-point performance was just a bad day, so they come out fired up. Oddsmakers usually ignore this, so the line can be off. With a 72.1% win rate, this is one of the most profitable systems out there for samples of at least 40 games.Week 16 qualifiersCincinnati Bengals -4 at Miami Dolphins | Confidence: 3 out of 5\nCincinnati qualifies after getting manhandled by the Baltimore Ravens 24-0 as 3.5-point home underdogs. The Bengals' defense should be better in this matchup. Week 16 is deep into the season for a rookie arm. With Tua Tagovailoa benched, Quinn Ewers steps in at quarterback. The rookie faces defensive coordinator Al Golden, who knows he doesn't need complicated schemes. Golden just needs to change up the coverage enough to make Ewers hesitate and throw off his timing.We are getting Joe Burrow laying less than a touchdown against a sub-500 team led by a rookie in his first career start. This price reflects Cincinnati's early-season defensive struggles rather than its current offensive potency, excluding last week's shutout. I like Burrow's chances to carve up a Miami secondary that ranks 27th in opponent passer rating. Burrow had a rough outing last week, posting just a 58.2 passer rating, so you can expect him to be fired up for a bounce-back performance. Meanwhile, the Dolphins look like a team that's headed for big changes once the season ends. DraftKings has the Bengals at -4 while most other books are at -4.5. If you like Cincinnati, now's the time to lock in the better number.\nLas Vegas Raiders +14 at Houston Texans | Confidence: 2.5 out of 5\nThe Raiders' 31-0 loss last week was the first time in 19 years they've been shut out twice in one season — both times by the same 31-0 score, including a game against the Chiefs in October. Now, they face a Texans defense ranked first in scoring, allowing just 16.3 points per game. For a Raiders team that looks ready to finish out the season, this is a tough matchup. There's some hope for Raiders fans: Geno Smith, who didn't practice last week, could be back for Week 16. Head coach Pete Carroll said Smith has \"a really good chance to be back\" against the Texans. This matchup features one of the league's best defenses against a struggling offense, but if Smith returns, it's a boost for anyone relying on Brock Bowers or Ashton Jeanty in fantasy playoffs.The Raiders have one real advantage: Maxx Crosby going up against Houston's weak offensive line (ranked 29th). If Crosby gets loose and picks up a few sacks, he can rattle C.J. Stroud, force bad throws and kill drives. This keeps the Texans' offensive output compressed rather than explosive. When the point spread is big, there's always a chance for a late, meaningless touchdown — especially since defenses often play soft coverage in the fourth quarter.Houston is on a hot streak, winning six in a row (5-1 ATS) and taking eight of its past 10 (7-3 ATS). With all that momentum, most people are likely to bet against the Raiders, so the oddsmakers will want to see Vegas cover the spread. Often, the sharp move is to side with the oddsmakers rather than follow the crowd.\n            ",

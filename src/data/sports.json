Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard. 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am predictions One major surprise the model is calling for at the WM Phoenix Open 2026: Gotterup, who has won two of the three events he's played in this year, including the WM Phoenix Open last week, doesn't even finish in the top 10 this week. He's a golfer to avoid in Pebble Beach bets. Gotteup has never played in this event before, so the model is not ready to treat him like a top-10 contender despite the fact that he's getting +3000 odds -- the same as Maysuyama and Xander Schuaffele. See who else to fade here. \nAnother surprise: The model is extremely high on Kim (+2700). Kim has been one of the hottest golfers on Tour so far this year, finishing no worse than T11 in his four events. He's been T6 or better in his last three events, and is coming off a T3 at the WM Phoenix Open and a T2 the prior week at the Farmers Insurance Open. He's also finished in the top 15 in this event in two straight seasons. See who else to pick here. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $100 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:How to make 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am picksThe model is also targeting four longshots of +3000 or longer as top-10 contenders, including one huge +5000 sleeper. You can only see the model's picks here. \nWho will win the 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, and which longshots will stun the golfing world?

    "body": "\n        With the NFL season officially over, sports bettors will take a closer look at the hardwood, and the current DraftKings promo code gives new users $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins. Monday features a 10-game NBA slate, including the Los Angeles Lakers hosting the Oklahoma City Thunder at 10 p.m. ET. Both teams will be without their leading scorers, with Thunder guard and reigning NBA MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (foot) out and Lakers superstar guard Luka Doncic (hamstring) out, but NBA legend LeBron James isn't on the injury report, and the Lakers are coming off a 103-97 win over the Warriors on Saturday without Doncic. Despite SGA being out, the Lakers are still underdogs, and the SportsLine Projection Model sees value in that. The model is backing the Lakers as 6.5-point underdogs as one of its Monday NBA best bets at DraftKings. The over/under for total points scored in Lakers vs. Thunder is 222.5.The model is also backing the Miami Heat to cover as 7.5-point favorites against the Utah Jazz, and one of SportsLine's top experts has locked in a college basketball bet on Xavier vs. No. 22 St. John's at 6:30 p.m. ET. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every NBA game 10,000 times and has returned well over $10,000 in betting profit for $100 players on its top-rated NBA picks over the past eight-plus seasons. The model enters the week before the NBA All-Star break on a sizzling 38-17 roll on top-rated NBA spread picks dating back to last season. Anyone following its NBA betting advice at sportsbooks and on betting apps could have seen huge returns.Monday best bets at DraftKings SportsbookSt. John's (-15.5) vs. Xavier (-110)Heat (-7.5) vs. Jazz (-112)Lakers (+6.5) vs. Thunder (-105)Combining the three picks into an Monday parlay at DraftKings would result in a payout of +605 (risk $100 to win $605). Bet it at DraftKings here: (Odds subject to change):\nSt. John's (-15.5) vs. Xavier (-110)\"Usually, we'd hesitate to go with a team after such a rousing win at St John's did against Big East leader UConn on Friday. Not tonight, however, as we suspect there is little chance the Red Storm (nine wins in a row) suddenly goes flat against Papa Rick Pitino's son Richard and his Xavier, which already took a good shot at the Johnnies in Cincinnati two weeks ago and put a scare into Papa in an 88-83 St John's escape,\" legendary SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall said. \"The Musketeers, however, have absorbed a couple of heavy losses since and been outclassed multiple times on the Big East trail, and dealing with the Storm's excellent balance, near 85 ppg offense, and productive frontliners Zuby Ejifor and Bryce Hopkins looms difficult.\" Back St. John's to cover at DraftKings here:Heat (-7.5) vs. Jazz (-112)The Heat are coming off a 132-101 victory over the Wizards on Saturday, and similar to Washington, Utah isn't exactly playing the most inspiring basketball in a 16-37 season. The Jazz are 2-12 over their last 14 games, with eight of those losses coming by double digits. Meanwhile, five of the Heat's last six wins have come by double digits. Although the Heat are just 6-5 over their last 11 games, it's hard to picture them losing straight up to the Jazz, and given the way their wins have gone recently, the model likes their chances of a win by a wider margin. Bam Adebayo had 22 points and eight rebounds on Saturday, as one of seven Heat players to finish with at least 10 points. The model projects the Heat to cover in 67% of simulations. Back the Heat to cover at DraftKings here:Lakers (+6.5) vs. Thunder (-105)The Thunder have struggled without SGA, while the Lakers have continued to win without Luka Doncic over the start of their current absences. The Thunder are 1-2 with SGA sidelined with his current foot injury, while the Lakers rallied from trailing when Doncic exited on Thursday with a hamstring injury to defeat the 76ers. Then, the Lakers defeated the Warriors on Saturday. Austin Reaves had 35 points on Thursday, and he's averaging 26.1 points per game this season. LeBron James continues to showcase his greatness, including posting 20 points, seven rebounds and 10 assists on Saturday with Doncic out. James has scored at least 20 points in four of his last five games. The Lakers host OKC on Monday, and they are 14-8 in Los Angeles this season. The model projects the Lakers to compete with the NBA-leading Thunder, who are missing SGA, with the Lakers covering in 63% of simulations. Back the Lakers to cover at DraftKings here:\nWant more NBA, college basketball picks on Monday?You've seen some of the model's Monday best bets.

With a collection of proven Olympic veterans and rising stars, the Americans have rolled through their first three games of the preliminary round.Team USA improved to 3-0-0-0 with a 5-0 blowout win over Switzerland on Monday. The U.S. has now outscored its opponents by a combined score of 15-1 at these Olympics, and the team turned in its second consecutive shutout effort after blanking Finland on Sunday.The Americans got off to a decent start, but Swiss goalie Andrea Brandli held strong for a while, but the dam broke eventually. First-time Olympian Haley Winn got the scoring started in the first period, and the next two goals were also scored by Olympic rookies in Joy Dunne and Hannah Bilka. Gwyneth Phillips turned in a sparkling 21-save performance in goal.The standout from Team USA's domination of Switzerland was defenseman Caroline Harvey. The Wisconsin star had a three-point game, and her lone goal was a beauty. She blew by a Swiss defender, faked a shot and put a silky deke on Brandli for the tally.\nThis win sets the stage for Tuesday's showdown with Canada, which was in the process of dismantling Czechia while the U.S. handled Switzerland. It may only be a preliminary round game, but the winner of Tuesday's matchup will have the inside track for a gold medal.Canada and United States are the only two countries that have won gold in women's ice hockey since the event was added to the Olympics in 1998. The Americans won that inaugural year in Nagano, then endured four straight Canadian victories until 2018, when Team USA struck back with a dramatic overtime win to capture gold in Pyeongchang.The Americans and Canadians will write another chapter in their heated rivalry on Tuesday.\nU.S. women's hockey scheduleAll times EasternPreliminary roundThursday, Feb. 5: USA 5, Czechia 1 Saturday, Feb. 7: USA 5, Finland 0Monday, Feb. 9: USA 5, Switzerland 0USA vs. Canada | Tuesday, Feb. 10 | 2:10 p.m. | USA NetworkQuarterfinalTBD vs. TBD | Friday, Feb. 13 | 3:10 p.m. | TBDSemifinalTBD vs. TBD | Monday, Feb. 16 | 10:40 a.m. | TBDBronze medal game\nTBD vs. TBD | Thursday, Feb. 19 | 8:40 a.m. | TBDGold medal gameTBD vs. TBD | Thursday, Feb. 19 | 1:10 p.m. | TBD\n            \n    ",

In true Monday morning quarterback fashion, there has been a debate over whether Vonn should have even attempted to fix skis after she tore her ACL two weeks ago. Vonn may be 41, but her father has already weighed in with when he expects to see her race next.The Milan Cortina Games will run through Sunday, Feb. 22, and in total of 119 events will take place with 245 medals handed out to the athletes.

Just one power conference team in the nation has leaned towards the Under more often than Kansas, which has seen the Under go 16-7. When facing teams that average over 72 points, as does Arizona at 89.3 ppg, the Under is 8-1 in Jayhawks games. Meanwhile, Arizona has seen its last two games overall go under, in addition to five of its last six fail to reach the total.Even with the Wildcats' potency on the offensive end, their defense is their strongest unit. Arizona is second in the nation in defensive rating and allows the eighth-lowest field goal percentage in Division I. Kansas star Darryn Peterson is projected to be held under his season average as the Under hits 55% of the time.The model also says one side of the spread hits over 50% of the time. You can only see that pick at SportsLine.So who wins Arizona vs. Kansas, and which side of the spread hits over 50% of the time? Visit SportsLine now to see which side of the Arizona vs. Kansas spread to back, all from the advanced model that has simulated this game 10,000 times, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The executive committee for the Women's National Basketball Players Association held a call Sunday to discuss the WNBA's latest collective bargaining agreement proposal, which arrived on Friday. The EC wanted to \"really understand everyone's point of view\" and \"get on the same page about what we're asking for,\" WNBPA vice president Breanna Stewart told CBS Sports in an exclusive interview Monday.The WNBA's proposal -- the league's first response to the players' latest offer, which came more than six weeks ago -- \"didn't move much money wise,\" Stewart said, but \"there were some minimum standard requirements that did come into play.\" That was \"important,\" Stewart added, because \"that means that the league heard us on things that matter to us.\"Notably, the league's latest proposal offered concessions on player housing and facility standards. First-year players and players on a minimum salary would be provided a one-bedroom apartment for the first three years of the CBA, while developmental players would be provided a studio apartment, a source familiar with the negotiations confirmed to CBS Sports. (The league previously agreed to create two new developmental player roster spots, a source familiar with the negotiations confirmed to CBS Sports. Those players would receive a stipend, plus money for each game appearance, but would be limited to a certain number of appearances.)The WNBA has provided housing for players since 1999. In the most recent CBA, teams were required to offer players a one-bedroom apartment or a stipend for housing costs. \n\n        \n            \n                WNBA CBA negotiations: WNBPA's Elizabeth Williams on need for 'urgency' and next steps after latest meeting\n                \n                    Lindsay Gibbs                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nKey stakeholders from the WNBPA and the WNBA, including multiple owners, met in-person on Feb. 2 for the first time since October. During that meeting, housing concerns and facility standards were two issues the players wanted to resolve. While the players were frustrated that the league did not arrive at that meeting with a counterproposal to the union's latest offer, the league has since responded with a proposal that satisfied some of the housing and facility questions. As Stewart noted, however, the league's response did not address the gap between the sides on revenue sharing -- though it did raise the salary cap to $5.65 million in 2026, a source familiar with the negotiation told CBS Sports. How that rise would affect specific salaries is unclear. The WNBA's proposal in early December offered a $5 million salary cap and a max salary of about $1.3 million in the first year of the deal. A source close to the situation told CBS Sports that over the course of the proposed deal, the max salary would raise to almost $2 million and that multiple players on each team would be eligible for the max salary. The minimum salary in this deal would start at $230,000 and the average salary would start at $530,000. \nAll of the above salary figures include a base salary plus a revenue-sharing component that includes both team and league revenue, something players have been asking for. The source estimates this deal would result in players getting about 70% of net revenue -- that is, the revenue remaining when league-specified operating expenses are removed from the pot.For comparison, in 2025, the WNBA's salary cap was about $1.5 million, the minimum salary was around $66,000 and its supermax was about $250,000.The WNBPA, however, reportedly countered with a proposal for the players to get 30% of gross revenue, moving the salary cap in 2026 to around $10.5 million with a max salary around $2.5 million. \nLast month, the WNBA announced the full schedule for the 2026 season. Training camps are scheduled to begin on April 19, with preseason games to begin on April 25 and opening night set for May 8. With just over two months until training camps are supposed to open, the two sides not only have to come to terms on a new CBA, but hold a double expansion draft for the Toronto Tempo and Portland Fire, and conduct the busiest free agency period in league history. Aside from Kalani Brown and Lexie Brown, every single player not on a rookie-scale contract is a free agent. \"Time is of the essence,\" Stewart said. Stewart added that she doesn't know if there's a drop dead date, at which point the league will no longer be able to start the season on time if there's no CBA in place. However, she made it clear that everyone knows that they're running out of time and need to get a deal done soon. \n\"I think that both sides are very aware that this has gone on way longer than it needed to,\" Stewart said. \"But hopefully we can really start to be hearing each other and they hear us on things that are non-negotiables.\"\n            ",

Over the course of those two weeks, athletes from 92 countries -- not including Russia or Belarus -- will compete in 16 different sports.At the 2022 Beijing Olympics, the United States finished tied for third in the gold medal count, just behind Norway and Germany. The U.S. brought home nine gold medals, which was tied with China in that category, but the Americans finished fifth in the overall medal count with 25.Team USA will try to improve upon those numbers in 2026, and they have some golden opportunities to do just that. Both the men's and women's hockey team should be in the running for a gold medal, Jordan Stolz is a favorite in speed skating, Chloe Kim is hitting the halfpipe in snowboarding and Mikaela Shiffrin will once again be on the ski slopes. And figure skaters Alysa Liu and Ilia Malinin have high potential to reach the podium.\nNorway will attempt to defend its title as the most awarded country in the Winter Olympics, both from 2022 and all-time. The Norwegians won 16 gold medals and 37 total medals at the Beijing Games four years ago, and they possess a large edge in the all-time medal count. Norway has won 148 gold medals and 406 total medals in its 24 appearances at the Winter Olympics. The Americans are a distant second with 330 total medals.Russian and Belarusian athletes are permitted to compete, but only as individuals under a neutral flag. They'll be classified as \"Individual Neutral Athletes,\" and their medals won't factor into the overall count. Russian and Belarusian teams are still banned from competing the Olympics.\nKeep track of the live medal count over the next couple weeks as the United States looks to fill up its trophy case while competing across Northern Italy.

    "body": "\n        The NBA Board of Governors is \"likely\" to vote on expansion this summer, with Seattle and Las Vegas serving as the two cities that are \"favored\" to land franchises, the Dallas Morning News reported on Sunday night shortly after the Seattle Seahawks defeated the New England Patriots, 29-13, in Super Bowl 60.Seattle and Las Vegas being the leading candidates to become the 31st and 32nd NBA franchises shouldn't come as a surprise. NBA commissioner Adam Silver addressed potential expansion in December ahead of the NBA Cup title game. Silver said they were looking at both cities.\"Not a secret, we're looking at this market in Las Vegas,\" said Silver speaking from the NBA Cup championship site. \"We are looking at Seattle. We've looked at other markets as well. I'd say I want to be sensitive there about this notion that we're somehow teasing these markets, because I know we've been talking about it for a while.\"Silver later mentioned during the press conference that \"sometime in 2026 we'll make a determination\" about potential expansion.\n\"I think Seattle and Las Vegas are two incredible cities,\" Silver said. \"Obviously, we had a team in Seattle that had great success. We have a WNBA team here in Las Vegas in the Aces. … I don't have any doubt that Las Vegas, despite all of the other major league teams that are here now, the other entertainment properties, that this city could support an NBA team.\"If Seattle does land an NBA franchise, it would mark the second time that's happened. Of course, the SuperSonics relocated from Seattle to Oklahoma City and are now known as the Thunder. Before the relocation, the SuperSonics played in Seattle from 1967 to 2008. They won their lone title in 1979.\nLas Vegas has been a popular destination for relocation of professional franchises in recent years. The NHL's Vegas Golden Knights were the first major pro sports team in town. The began play in the 2017-18 season and won the Stanley Cup in June of 2023. The Aces followed in 2018, moving from San Antonio, and they've won WNBA titles in 2022, 2023 and 2025. The Raiders moved from Oakland to Las Vegas ahead of the 2020 NFL season, and are 0-1 in the playoffs since. Finally, the Athletics are expected to play in Las Vegas at the start of the 2028 MLB season. The A's played their final season in Oakland in 2024 and are playing home games in Sacramento while the Las Vegas ballpark is under construction.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        What could have been a miraculous comeback story at the Olympics ended in heartbreak for Lindsey Vonn, who was airlifted to a hospital after a devastating crash in the women's downhill final on Sunday at the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Games. Vonn announced after undergoing surgery that she sustained a complex tibia fracture during the catastrophic run and that she will have to undergo multiple more procedures to repair her broken leg.Vonn had already fought through a torn ACL -- which she sustained in a training accident just one week ahead of the Olympics -- and would have been the greatest recovery stories in all of sports had she gotten to the medal podium while racing on a bad knee. Instead, her competitive career may be over for good.In the wake of her agonizing incident on the mountain in Italy, Vonn released a statement via social media:\"Yesterday my Olympic dream did not finish the way I dreamt it would. It wasn't a story book ending or a fairy tail, it was just life. I dared to dream and had worked so hard to achieve it. Because in Downhill ski racing the difference between a strategic line and a catastrophic injury can be as small as 5 inches.\"I was simply 5 inches too tight on my line when my right arm hooked inside of the gate, twisting me and resulted in my crash. My ACL and past injuries had nothing to do with my crash whatsoever.\"Unfortunately, I sustained a complex tibia fracture that is currently stable but will require multiple surgeries to fix properly.\"While yesterday did not end the way I had hoped, and despite the intense physical pain it caused, I have no regrets. Standing in the starting gate yesterday was an incredible feeling that I will never forget. Knowing I stood there having a chance to win was a victory in and of itself. I also knew that racing was a risk. It always was and always will be an incredibly dangerous sport.\"And similar to ski racing, we take risks in life. We dream. We love. We jump. And sometimes we fall. Sometimes our hearts are broken. Sometimes we don't achieve the dreams we know we could have. But that is the also the beauty of life; we can try.\"I tried. I dreamt. I jumped.\"I hope if you take away anything from my journey it's that you all have the courage to dare greatly. Life is too short not to take chances on yourself. Because the only failure in life is not trying.\"I believe in you, just as you believed in me.\"Injuries, unfortunately, largely defined Vonn's career. She will always be heralded as one of the greatest skiers of all time, but her battles with knee issues and other ailments are more than just a footnote on her remarkable résumé. The most recent torn ligament and broken bone may spell the end of an unforgettable two-plus decades as one of the faces of the sport.Olympic skiing figures defend Vonn for competing on torn ACLThe consensus from the Olympic skiing community is clear: Don't blame Vonn for pushing the limits, and don't think that her crash was a result of her torn ACL.Leaders of international skiing bodies and some of Vonn's fellow competitors set the record straight that Sunday's crash was entirely unrelated to her preexisting injury.\"Totally incorrect,\" Vonn's teammate Keely Cashman said, via the Associated Press. \"People that don't know ski racing don't really understand what happened yesterday. She hooked her arm on the gate, which twisted her around. She was going probably 70 miles an hour, and so that twists your body around. That has nothing to do with her ACL, nothing to with her knee. I think a lot of people are ridiculing that, and a lot people don't [know] what's going on.\"International Ski and Snowboard Federation president Johan Eliasch called Vonn \"incredibly unlucky\" and said the incident was a \"one in 1,000\" situation.The downhill is alpine skiing's fastest and most dangerous event. A myriad of things could go wrong on any given run, often with dramatic consequences. A fully intact ACL would have done nothing to prevent Vonn from tumbling down the mountain after clipping the gate on that fateful jump.Vonn's dramatic exit from the downhill final precipitated a wave of hindsight-aided reactions from fans and pundits. The American skiing legend should have played it safe and backed out of the competition the moment she tore her ACL, some argued. But those most experienced in the sport emphasized that Vonn was able to train at a high caliber despite the injury, and they noted that she consulted with qualified trainers and coaches before making the decision to race.\"This decision was really hers and her team to take,\" International Olympic Committee sports director Pierre Ducrey said. \"She made the decision and unfortunately it led to the injury, but I think it's really the way that the decision gets made for every athlete that participates to the downhill.\"Vonn's competitive future in question after latest injuriesThat Vonn elected to compete in such a dangerous and demanding event at less than full strength may have led some to question her sanity, others commended the three-time Olympic medalist for her courage and commitment to the sport. The latter argument only solidifies her legacy as an all-time great. But with health being such a large part of her competitive story at this point in her career, it is reasonable to wonder just how much more Vonn has left in the tank.\nIf it were up to her father, Vonn would hang up her ski boots for good at the end of this Olympic run.\"She's 41 years old and this is the end of her career,\" Vonn's father, Alan Kildow, said to the Associated Press. \"There will be no more ski races for Lindsey Vonn, as long as I have anything to say about it.\"Vonn retired from competition in February 2019 after the World Championships, citing her already lengthy injury history. She announced nearly six years later that she was coming out of retirement, and with the goal of qualifying for the 2026 Winter Olympics, she returned to the slopes in December 2024. Two months ago, Vonn became the oldest downhill skiing World Cup winner at 41.\nIf this is the end of the road for Vonn in her professional endeavors, it will be a bitter exit from the sport for a fervent competitor.\"She's a very strong individual,\" Kildow said. \"She knows physical pain and she understands the circumstances that she finds herself in. And she's able to handle it. Better than I expected. She's a very, very strong person. And so I think she's handling it real well.\"\n            ",

The pending free agent made a post on Instagram Monday night, saying \"The time for me to find a new home has come.\"\"Cleveland, first off I love you. These 9 years have been a beautiful journey. I'm am so grateful for all the memories we shared together. Thank you to The Haslams, Andrew Berry and the whole browns organization for everything!! All my teammates I shared the battle with I'm so grateful for you guys. The time for me to find a new home has come and all I can think of is just the gratefulness in my heart. The city of Cleveland will forever be home.\"\n\nNjoku played out the four-year, $56.75 million extension he signed back in 2022. He is coming off one of the worst seasons of his career, as Njoku caught 33 passes for 293 yards and four touchdowns in 12 games played. The 29-year-old pass-catcher has crossed 600 yards receiving in three of his nine seasons, and made the Pro Bowl in 2023 after a career year in which he caught 81 passes for 882 yards and six touchdowns. Njoku's 384 career receptions rank third in Browns franchise history, his 4,062 yards receiving rank 12th and his 34 receiving touchdowns rank sixth. Njoku took a backseat to rookie tight end Harold Fannin Jr. in 2025, who caught 72 passes for 731 yards and six touchdowns. Those 72 receptions were the seventh-most recorded by a rookie tight end in NFL history, and Fannin's 731 yards receiving ranked fourth among all rookies.\nNjoku is CBS Sports' No. 41-ranked free agent this offseason. Injuries have cost Njoku at least five games in each of the last two seasons, but he is still a reliable pass-catcher that can serve as a quarterback's security blanket.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        In a potential landmark ruling for the future of college sports, a judge denied Alabama basketball player Charles Bediako's motion seeking a preliminary injunction against NCAA eligibility rules, according to court documents obtained by AL.com. Bediako, who returned to the Crimson Tide after signing an NBA contract and playing in the G League, will no longer be permitted to play college basketball under NCAA bylaws.Bediako became the first former pro to return to college when he received a temporary restraining order against the NCAA in January. That order prohibited the NCAA from enforcing its eligibility rules on the 7-footer and paved the way for him to play in five games for the Crimson Tide, across which he averaged 10 points, 4.6 rebounds and 1.4 blocks per game.The temporary restraining order was always a stopgap solution to get Bediako on the floor. His ultimate goal was to receive an injunction which would effectively clear him to play the rest of the season. Bediako and his counsel were back in court last Friday for the injunction hearing, and after deliberating on the matter over the weekend, judge Daniel Pruet ruled in the NCAA's favor and denied the injunction.\"Common sense won a round today,\" NCAA president Charlie Baker said in a statement. \"The court saw this for what it is: an attempt by professionals to pivot back to college and crowd out the next generation of students. College sports are for students, not for people who already walked away to go pro and now want to hit the 'undo' button at the expense of a teenager's dream.\n\"While we're glad the court upheld the rules our members actually want, one win doesn't fix the national mess of state laws. It's time for Congress to stop watching from the sidelines and help us provide some actual stability.\"Bediako's return to college basketball drew the ire of many throughout the sport, and it even prompted SEC commissioner Greg Sankey to sign an affidavit against his cause. Days before the injunction hearing, Sankey asked the judge to uphold the eligibility rules \"which are essential to the integrity of college sports, to the educational mission they serve, and to the opportunities they provide for current and future student-athletes.\"This case delivered numerous twists, including an extension of Bediako's temporary restraining order, the recusal of a judge who was an Alabama booster and the postponement of the injunction hearing. All the while, Bediako was on the floor for the Crimson Tide for the first time since the 2023 NCAA Tournament.\n\"We are disappointed in today's court ruling, denying the injunction for Charles Bediako,\" the University of Alabama said in a statement. \"While we understand the concern around competitive and developmental implications of former professional athletes participating in college, it is important to acknowledge reality.\"The NCAA has granted eligibility to over 100 current men's basketball players with prior professional experience in the G League or overseas. Granting eligibility to some former professionals, and not to others, is what creates the havoc we are currently in and why consistency from decision-makers is so desperately needed.\"The NCAA does routinely grant eligibility waivers to athletes with professional experience -- namely those who played for G League Ignite before its fold in 2024 and those who come to the United States from overseas -- but only if they have not yet played American college basketball. The association strictly prohibits players like Bediako from leaving for the NBA or another pro league and then returning for a second stint of college basketball.\nBediako ruling could impact other ongoing eligibility casesWhile Bediako was the first professional player to return to college, he is not the only athlete seeking additional eligibility through the court system. His denial of an injunction could have ramifications for those other cases.All of these arguments exist on the basis that the NCAA's four-year eligibility limit unfairly restricts athletes' abilities to earn compensation for their name, image and likeness. Bediako sought to utilize the years he forwent when he declared for the NBA Draft. Others, like Tennessee quarterback Joey Aguilar and Ole Miss quarterback Trinidad Chambliss, argue that the seasons they spent in junior college should not count toward their four-year eligibility clocks.Both Aguilar and Chambliss went to state courts to seek another year with their respective football programs. Now that there exists legal precedent in one of these cases, the judges presiding over their respective cases could cite the Bediako ruling in decisions to rule against their injunctive relief. The quarterbacks' cases are different enough, however, that such an outcome is no guarantee.\n            ",

One of the top matchups features an L.A. vs. L.A. rivalry when the Los Angeles Lakers host the Los Angeles Clippers at 10 p.m. ET, and the SportsLine Projection Model expects this to be one of the most exciting matchups of the slate. If you are a fan of offense, this could be your must-bet game since the model projects Over 224.5 total points for Lakers vs. Clippers as one of its Friday NBA best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook.The model is also backing the Cavaliers to cover as 5.5-point favorites for its Friday NBA best bets at DraftKings.

Charlotte won 10 of 11 games before the break, but dropped its first game out in a 105-101 final to the Rockets on Thursday. Meanwhile, the Cavaliers continued their winning ways from before the break in a 112-84 win over the Nets on Friday for their sixth straight win. Five of those six Cleveland wins came by at least six points, and the Cavaliers went 5-1 against the spread during that span. The model projects Cleveland's roll to continue, with the Cavaliers covering in 66% of simulations. Back the Cavaliers to cover at DraftKings here:Miami (OH) (-7.5) vs. Bowling Green (-115)\"The notion that a team could possibly go undefeated in the regular season and not make the NCAA Tournament is ludicrous to me,\" SportsLine expert Eric Cohen said. \"Sure, Miami's schedule is weak, but their fate shouldn't be determined on a fluky conference tournament if they lose even just one time in the regular season. They are 101 spots ahead of Bowling Green in the NET Rankings and already beat them by 10 earlier this season. I would be surprised if this wasn't another double-digit win for a team that is 17-6 ATS this season.\" Back Miami (OH) to cover at DraftKings here:Clippers vs. Lakers: Over 224.5 points (-108)The Lakers have gone Over in two of their last three games, and the Clippers are coming off a 115-114 win over the Nuggets on Thursday, going Over their total for that contest. The Lakers have the rest advantage with Friday being their first game out of the NBA All-Star break, and after Luka Doncic made an appearance in the NBA All-Star Game despite missing the final contests for the Lakers entering the break, the NBA's leading scorer is expected to play Friday. Doncic leads the NBA at 32.8 points per game. Combined with a rested LeBron James and the tired legs of the Clippers in the second half of a back-to-back, which could lead to subpar defense, the model projects the Over to hit in 64.1% of simulations. Back the Over at DraftKings here:\nWant more NBA and college basketball picks on Friday?You've seen some of the model's Friday best bets.

Arsenal just played the worst team in the Premier League, Wolves, and ended up dropping two points against them after a goal from Wolves in stoppage time. Every time Arsenal drop points against clubs, it gives a little bit of extra motivation for Pep Guardiola and his squad, who will look to close that gap.While neither club is playing at the top of their game right now, I expect City to smell blood in the water as Arsenal have a history of struggling during the winter months. This is a critical match for Manchester City and while Newcastle looked fantastic against Qarabag on the road in UCL, this should be a big three points for City.Bet on Manchester City vs. Newcastle at BetMGM using the promo code CBSSPORTS, which gives new users up to $1,500 in bonus bets if their qualifying wager loses:Goals galore in Newcastle matchesWhile Manchester City can be a tough nut to crack defensively, if anyone was going to do it right now, it would be Newcastle with the form they are in. They just traveled to Azerbaijan to play the Azerbaijani giants, Qarabag in UCL play earlier this week and demolished them 6-1. Anthony Gordan picked up four goals, while Jacob Murphy and Malick Thiaw also found the scoresheet. This is a club which has gone Over its goal total in the last six matches. They've also seen both teams scoring in each of those six matches as well. The pitch will be littered with goal-scoring threats, and I'm expecting both clubs to find the back of the net.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The middle of February may seem too early for Fantasy Football projections. 'Seem' may not be a strong enough word in that first sentence. Free agency is right around the corner, but the NFL Draft won't happen for two more months. It is way too early. But that doesn't mean it isn't helpful to take a snapshot before things get crazy.The most interesting thing about the projections below is obvious right from the top. Sam LaPorta at TE1 shocked even me, and I have done a little massaging already to move him closer to Brock Bowers and Trey McBride. All three tight ends will have new offensive coordinators and/or head coaches in 2026, and one in particular has a large role in the direction these projections are moving: Drew Petzing.Petzing was McBride's OC in 2025 and will be LaPorta's OC in 2026. Why does he matter so much? In his three seasons with the Cardinals, Arizona averaged 162 tight end targets per season, peaking with 218 last year. Petzing comes from the Kevin Stefanski tree, and Stefanski's Browns have averaged 167 tight end targets per season. This is arguably the most tight end friendly offensive system in the NFL. It is a system that has benefitted McBride, and now it is LaPorta's turn.While the big question comes down to how much losing Petzing hurts McBride, and how much gaining Petzing hurts LaPorta, we shouldn't gloss over the uncertainty surrounding Bowers. For my money, he still has the highest upside of this trio, but he will have both a new head coach in Klint Kubiak and a new QB in (most likely) Fernando Mendoza. I could spin these changes positively or negatively without much effort, but I do at the very least expect the offensive environment to be better in Las Vegas than it was in 2025. Hopefully, Bowers is healthier as well.\nThat being said, it seems unlikely that McBride or Bowers are in offenses that score as many points as LaPorta's Lions. Over the past three seasons, LaPorta has scored on 7.9% of his targets, compared to McBride's 3.8% rate. For his career, Bowers has scored on 5.0% of his targets. If those trends hold, LaPorta can be more productive on fewer targets for Fantasy Football purposes.The beauty of all this is that I can still rank Bowers (because of upside) and McBride (because of floor) higher than LaPorta while telling you that these projections suggest LaPorta will be the best value on Draft Day. This is assuming that he is 100% recovered from his back injury by the time we get to August, of course.These projections also don't reflect just how deep the position looks right now. Kyle Pitts and Isaiah Likely could enter the top 12 with a good landing spot, and Travis Kelce could do the same if he chooses to play one more year of football. The prize landing spot for Pitts and Likely would be in Atlanta with Stefanski, but it's possible he brings in veteran David Njoku, who already knows his system.\nHere are my way-too-early tight end projections:\n            ",

The U.S. hasn't been to the gold medal game since 2010, and it has a great chance to end that drought on Friday.Through its first four games of the tournament, the U.S. has been somewhat inconsistent, but the team has shown the ability to elevate its game at the right time. The American defensemen have played a big role in keeping them alive, especially Hughes, who is tied for the team lead in points with six.Goaltender Connor Hellebuyck has allowed just three goals in three starts, and his save percentage of .957 leads all Olympians, as does his 0.98 GAA. Hellebuyck was especially sharp against Sweden, and he's a big reason why Slovakia should have a tough time putting a crooked number on the scoreboard.Up front, the top three U.S. centers have all had their moment to shine. Jack Eichel has played a great two-way game in each contest, Auston Matthews is tied with Hughes for the team lead in scoring and Dylan Larkin was one of the heroes against Sweden.When it comes to the Slovakian roster, their star power begins and ends with Montreal Canadiens winger Juraj Slafkovsky. He has seven points in four games and seems to be involved on every big goal the Slovaks score. The real surprise of the tournament has been Slovakian goalie Samuel Hlavaj, who boasts a .932 save percentage and will present a challenge for the American offense.Since NHL players first went to the Olympics in 1998, the Americans have never medaled outside of North America.

    "body": "\n        Major League Baseball's exhibition season gets underway Friday afternoon. Unlike most years, this round of spring training isn't just serving as a warm-up for the players, but rather will also serve as the final rehearsal before the new automated ball-strike challenge system is implemented during the regular season. Indeed, for the first time in MLB history, technology will be used in games to verify balls and strikes. To be clear: technology will not be calling every ball and strike. This is, instead, a compromise between a fully automated system and a fully human approach. Teams will be afforded a set number of challenges per game, which they can then exercise at their will. Such a momentous occasion deserves a closer examination. Below, CBS Sports has provided an answer to all of the questions you may have concerning the ABS, including how it works and how often calls have been overturned. Let's get to it.1. How does ABS work?Essentially, it makes use of advanced camera and limb-tracking technology to create an individualized strike zone for every batter. As an engineer familiar with the inner workings of the system outlined in 2021, from there the system is really a collection of four subsets:\nThe MLB tracking system;An interface the ballpark operator uses to set the correct batter;An MLB server that receives the tracking data and has the ball-strike evaluation code;A low-latency communication system to relay calls to the umpire.One key component of the ABS system is that measurements of each player will allow the technology to render specific strike zones, rather than a generalized zone. Baseball America has explained that process in the past: \"The new zone will mean each player's strike zone is uniquely tied to their body and stance rather than a universal formula. The new strike zone is hoped to more closely resemble the strike zone used by human umpires, although the top end is still designed to be lower than the top end of the MLB strike zone.\"2. What are the in-game guidelines? As the \"challenge\" aspect of the name suggests, teams are limited to two challenges per game. They can be used at any time, on any pitch. Teams will keep their challenges if they are successful, but do note that the dugout cannot initiate challenges. Instead, they must come from either the batter or the battery. Last spring, batters often tapped their helmet to call for a challenge.\nTeams will be awarded one additional challenge at the start of every inning beyond the ninth, but those do not roll over or accumulate if they are successful or unused.Per MLB guidelines, a pitch can be subject to both an ABS challenge and a replay challenge -- think a called strike (or ball) that precedes a throw on an attempted stolen base.3. Has ABS been used before?Yes, as you would expect given the stakes. MLB tested a few approaches to the ABS system in the minors in recent years, including full automation. They've also experimented with the challenge system at the big-league level, albeit only in exhibition settings to date (last year's spring training and the All-Star Game), as a means of stress-testing the technology with an audience of big-league personnel. Those tests went off without a hitch, clearing the way for full-time implementation. \n4. How long does it take and how often are calls overturned?If you haven't seen the challenge system at work yet, don't fear: it's not like replay challenges, where the process can linger and slow down the game for minutes at a time. The ABS system is quick and painless, offering a resolution within a matter of seconds. Here's an example of it at work:\nSo far as the other part of the subheading goes, all available data suggests it would be reasonable to expect a success rate around 50%. MLB released data last year showing that 52.2% of challenges during spring training were successful. Meanwhile, TruMedia's minor-league data had the MiLB success rate around 49%. Obviously the exact overturn rate will fluctuate based on the strategies 5. Anything else worth knowing?Yes, and it's arguably the most important aspect of the whole operation: MLB will not permit challenges whenever a positional player is pitching. Sorry to those who wanted to see a particularly challenge-happy hitter receive a taste of his own medicine. \n            ",

Over the course of those two weeks, athletes from 92 countries -- not including Russia or Belarus -- will compete in 16 different sports.At the 2022 Beijing Olympics, the United States finished tied for third in the gold medal count, just behind Norway and Germany. The U.S. brought home nine gold medals, which was tied with China in that category, but the Americans finished fifth in the overall medal count with 25.Team USA has already exceeded its overall medal tally, now at 27, and stands to add to both the overall count and possibly even the gold medal count. A win over Slovakia on Friday would assure the U.S. men's hockey team of some type of medal as it would advance to Sunday's final.On Thursday, figure skater Alysa Liu, 20, became the first American woman to take home a singles gold in 24 years and the U.S. women's hockey team rallied from a 1-0 third period deficit to a 2-1 overtime victory over rival Canada to reach the top of the podium for the first time in eight years. And speedskater Jordan Stolz added to his collection of two previous gold medals with a silver in the men's 1,500 meters.\nNorway will attempt to defend its title as the most awarded country in the Winter Olympics, both from 2022 and all-time. The Norwegians won 16 gold medals and 37 total medals at the Beijing Games four years ago, and they possess a large edge in the all-time medal count. Entering these Games, Norway had won 148 gold medals and 406 total medals in its 24 appearances at the Winter Olympics. The Americans are a distant second with 330 total medals.Russian and Belarusian athletes are permitted to compete, but only as individuals under a neutral flag.

    "body": "\n        On a day at Riviera Country Club that featured everything from a deluge of rain to a 3-hour weather delay to wind gusts hovering around 30 miles per hour, a man who has done just about everything in the game of golf rose to the top of the leaderboard. Rory McIlroy was nearly flawless in the first round of the 2026 Genesis Invitational, shooting his lowest-ever score across the first 18 holes at Riviera with a 5-under 66 to sit one stroke behind Aaron Rai.Round 1 was suspended due to darkness with the likes of world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler, Xander Schauffele and Jordan Spieth all needing to complete the majority of their back nines on Friday when play resumes at 7 a.m. PT.Scheffler will take the interruption in stride as he was 5 over through 10 holes, 11 strokes off the lead and tied for last place when play was called. It's the third straight week in which the best player in the game has slipped out of the gate.McIlroy, meanwhile, was among the first players on the golf course; as such, he was able to finish his first round. He now looks to do what neither tournament host Tiger Woods nor legend Jack Nicklaus accomplished in their careers: win at the historic venue that is Riviera. On the line is not only the trophy and a signature event purse but the five-time major champion reaching the 30-win mark on the PGA Tour.\n\"I've definitely got more comfortable playing in conditions like this over the past few years as I've gotten more comfortable in controlling my ball flight, and controlling my ball flight taking a lot more club, hitting the ball low,\" McIlroy said. \"I've started to just really enjoy this style of golf. \"If you had asked me 10 years ago, I didn't enjoy these conditions, but it's been a shift in a mindset and maybe just a continuation of trying to build upon the skill set that I have. Then, when it does get to conditions like this, I'm a lot more prepared. I wouldn't say I enjoy them, but I can certainly handle them better.\"If McIlroy plays the next 54 holes in the same manner as his first 18, he will win this tournament. Battling and overcoming the conditions, he played golf in its truest essence -- flighting drives depending on the wind direction, leaving himself with easy leaves and taking care of the scoring holes.\nAttacking the early portions of both nines, McIlroy started his round emphatically, making birdie on three of his first four holes to propel himself to the top of the leaderboard. His birdie on the newly lengthened par-3 4th came right out of the rain delay as his first stroke produced a 30-foot birdie.\nOnce the rain subsided, wind entered the equation, and McIlroy answered masterfully. Showing off every tool in his belt, the 36-year-old headlined his grouping that featured another round in the 60s from Tommy Fleetwood -- the Englishman has broken 70 in 20 straight PGA Tour rounds -- and a nifty 68 from last week's winner Collin Morikawa. \"Just trying to keep the same mindset essentially,\" Morikawa said. \"You don't want to get too relaxed, but you also want to kind of find that zone to go out and play golf. A long day, a lot of back and forth kind of rain, no rain, a lot of wind, no wind. Just was able to get the ball in the hole, which was kind of the whole goal.\"\nLeader1. Aaron Rai (-6): Known as a Point A to Point B type of player, Rai kept everything in front of him on Thursday, and he was rewarded with a stellar performance on the greens. The Englishman opened with an eagle, tacked on six more birdies and made putts from nearly 80 feet on No. 9, 7 feet on No. 11, 21 feet on No. 13, 12 feet on No. 15 and finally 7 feet on No. 16. He will have a chance to extend his lead Friday morning as he starts his day on the par-5 17th.ContendersT2. Rory McIlroy, Jacob Bridgeman (-5)4. Ryan Fox (-4)T5.

Jhonattan Vegas, Taylor Pendrith, Maverick McNealy, Viktor Hovland, Hideki Matsuyama, Tommy Fleetwood, Ryo Hisatsune, Harry Hall (-2)Only two weeks into his PGA Tour season, and Hovland is already searching for answers with his driver. He may have found them on Thursday. Missing only two fairways, the Norwegian looked noticeably more comfortable with the big stick in hand and was sensational from tee to green. He will need to clean up his play on and around the green as all three bogeys were courtesy of some sloppy play in that area, but if his full swing is in order, he should love his placement.\n\"You might have seen the band drill that I was messing around with now. It's still trying to serve the same purpose, but I feel like that actually made it easier for me to find something tangible that I could take out on the golf course,\" Hovland said. \"Trying to just get a little bit wider in the downswing, not trying to pull my arms as close to me. That's what the floaties were for, trying to get some space in the downswing. It was just hard to feel that when I took the floaties away. \"But the band, because it forces your body to push against the tension, and then when you take it away, it's like, 'Wow, that's what it's supposed to feel like.' We're not quite all there yet, even though this is a great round of golf, but that was a huge step in the right direction.\"\nScheffler's Thursday struggles continueIt was an inauspicious start from the world No. 1 on the first hole as Scheffler found the surface on the easy par 5 only to need three putts and walk off the green with a par. That ultimately told the tale of his day as Scheffler never made it easy on himself.\nWith two bogeys in his first six holes, he started to head even further south on the leaderboard when he made a head-scratching double bogey on No. 8, which featured another three-putt. He turned in 4 over, made an ugly bogey on the devilish, short par-4 10th and made par on another scoring chance on the par-5 11th to put a bow on his day.Like the last three weeks, Scheffler faces a long climb back, and unlike last week, he will be staring the cutline directly in the face as the top 50 players and ties (as well as those within 10 strokes of the leader) will secure tee times over the weekend.2026 Genesis Invitational updated odds, picksOdds via DraftKings SportsbookRory McIlroy: +350Aaron Rai: 10-1Si Woo Kim: 13-1Jacob Bridgeman: 15-1Collin Morikawa: 15-1Tommy Fleetwood: 18-1Hideki Matsuyama: 19-1Scheffler is at 26-1, if that tickles your fancy, but instead, we will look at someone else on the golf course with holes remaining in his first round: Matt Fitzpatrick at 36-1. The Englishman is 1 under, through 15 holes and will have a couple of scoring chances coming in Friday morning. He made nothing on the greens Thursday, so if his fortunes change, he will make up some ground.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        It has been a tough spring for the Atlanta Braves, who play their first exhibition game on Saturday. They've already lost righties Spencer Schwellenbach and Hurston Waldrep to elbow surgery after getting hit so hard by injuries last year. Both are having loose bodies removed from their elbows and their recovery will be measured in months, not weeks.     \"There's  nothing you can do,\" new manager Walt Weiss said (via MLB.com). \"These guys get hurt doing what they  do. You go out there and pitch enough, at some point, something is bound  to happen. So I don't beat my head against the wall with stuff like  this. I just know it's part of the deal. I wish it hadn't happened. But,  we put our heads down and keep going.\"     In the grand scheme of things, getting loose bodies taken out of your elbow isn't that bad. It's not Tommy John surgery, it's nothing to do with ligaments or tendons. The prognosis for a full recovery is very good. It's just that surgery will keep them on the sidelines for a big chunk of the season. Schwellenbach is already on the 60-day injured list. Waldrep will join him soon enough.     At one point last season all five members of Atlanta's Opening Day rotation were on the injured list. A starting pitcher seemed to be a clear need in the offseason, at least a back-end innings guy, but the Braves instead focused their efforts on improving the bullpen and the lineup. Here is the club's rotation depth chart:     \nLHP Chris SaleRHP Spencer StriderRHP Spencer Schwellenbach (out with elbow surgery)RHP Reynaldo López (missed most of 2025 with shoulder surgery)RHP Grant Holmes (coming back from a partial UCL tear)RHP Hurston Waldrep (out with elbow surgery)RHP Bryce ElderRHP AJ Smith-Shawver (will miss most or all of 2026 with Tommy John surgery)LHP José SuarezLHP Martín Pérez (minor-league contract)RHP Carlos Carrasco (minor-league contract)There is an awful lot of age/injury risk in that group. Elder is probably Atlanta's safest bet to take the ball every fifth day, and he has a 5.26 ERA with poor under-the-hood numbers in close to 300 big-league innings since going to the 2023 All-Star Game. The Braves threw 20-year-old Didier Fuentes into the fire last summer and the result was 20 runs in 13 innings.     Schwellenbach has performed at a near-ace level when healthy the last two years. Waldrep was so impressive down the stretch last season. Those two were expected to be a significant part of the rotation this year (especially Schwellenbach) and now Atlanta is scrambling to fill their innings. Not the best start to the spring for a team looking to bounce back from a 76-win season.     Where can the Braves turn to add pitching between now and Opening Day? Here's a look at their pitching options.     \n     Free agency     \nIt's too late now, but I thought Chris Bassitt was an excellent fit for the Braves dating back to the start of the offseason. Bassitt -- who signed with the Orioles -- is a steady presence you can reasonably count on to take the ball every fifth day, and you needn't try hard to see him being worthy of a start come the postseason. The Braves never seemed to show much interest though. So it goes.     Anyway, there are still some solid pitchers sitting in free agency and waiting for a contract. No one who will swing a division race or a postseason series, but pitchers who are plenty qualified to help a contending team get through the grind of the 162-game regular season. Here are the top unsigned starters according to FanGraphs' projected 2026 WAR:     RHP Zack Littell: 1.6 WARRHP Lucas Giolito: 1.2 WARRHP Max Scherzer: 1.2 WARLHP Patrick Corbin: 0.9 WARLHP Tyler Anderson: 0.5 WARIt's frankly ridiculous Littell is still unsigned. He's not a frontline starter or anything, but he's thrown the 24th most innings the last two years (just ahead of Bassitt and Zac Gallen) and has been roughly league average. He's only 30, too. This isn't a veteran in his mid-30s trying to hang on. Guys who can give you 30 league average-ish starts should not still be unemployed in February.     \nGiolito was unable to pitch in the postseason last year because of an elbow injury, though he declined his end of a $19 million mutual option to become a free agent, so the elbow must be in good shape. Giolito received a $1.5 million buyout. Will he be able to recoup the $17.5 million he walked away from? I'm not sure. Would the Braves pay that anyway? I don't think so.     Scherzer is nearing the end of the line and has hinted at signing at midseason, so file him away for later. If Anderson or Corbin will take a minor-league contract, sure, sign them, otherwise I wouldn't guarantee them a rotation spot. Littell seems like such an obvious fit, especially since he has bullpen experience and can shift into a relief role in the event everyone gets healthy.     Per FanGraphs, the Braves have a $260 million competitive balance tax payroll, eighth-highest in baseball and just under the $264 million second penalty tier. If the Braves want to stay under $264 million and avoid escalating tax rates, it won't be possible to add a starter, especially not one of Littell's or Giolito's or Scherzer's caliber. Money could be an issue.     \n     Trades     \nSpring training is a bad time to need starting pitchers. First and foremost, very few teams are willing to trade pitchers this time of the year. There's just not much out there. Also, the teams that are willing to move arms know the Braves are in a bind and perhaps a bit desperate, and will raise their asking prices accordingly. Spring trades for pitching can be tough to swing.     \"We're  going to continue to have discussions all spring training,\" POBO Alex Anthopoulos told MLB.com about the team's pitching search. \"There's still guys out there and guys you can get through trade.  But again, we like the four (veteran starters we have) and we like the guys  competing for the fifth spot as well.\"     It's easy to connect the dots on a Joe Ryan trade given A) his place in trade rumors the last year or so, and B) Pablo López's elbow injury putting a big dent in the Minnesota Twins' contention hopes. If the Twins seriously consider offers for Ryan, there will be a fierce bidding war, and I'm not sure Atlanta has the prospects to make that happen. Try though, for sure.\nLefty Bailey Falter has been pushed pretty far down the depth chart in Kansas City and the Royals could move him if they'd rather not pay him $3.6 million to be a swingman/spot starter. Righties Landon Knack (Los Angeles Dodgers) and Keider Montero (Detroit Tigers), and lefty Jordan Wicks (Chicago Cubs), stand out as possibly available depth starters.     I wonder about Patrick Sandoval. The left-hander missed last season with Tommy John surgery and is facing hitters now, but even after all their offseason trades, he's no higher than sixth on the Boston Red Sox depth chart. Boston is right up against the $264 million second competitive balance tax penalty tier and may want to move Sandoval's $12.75 million salary.     Unless there really is a way to make Ryan happen or someone unexpectedly shakes loose, a trade probably isn't the best way for the Braves to reinforce their rotation. Few teams are looking to move starters in the spring and the pitchers who are available will cost you a pretty penny because supply is low and demand is high. I'd consider a trade a last resort.     \n     The scrap heap     \n                                    \n                    Walker Buehler\n                \n            SP\n        \n                    ERA4.93WHIP1.52IP126BB61K92        \n            \nMost likely, Anthopoulos will scour the waiver wire and see whether any cheap depth arms become available. Righty Osvaldo Bido, who had a solid 2024 and a not-so-good 2025 with the Athletics, seems unlikely to win a job with the New York Yankees. He was with the Braves for a few weeks between waiver claims in December, and they could circle back if he hits the wire again.     Right-handers Cooper Criswell (Seattle Mariners), Janson Junk (Miami Marlins), Luis Medina (A's), and Matt Waldron (San Diego Padres) are out of options (i.e. must go through waivers to go to Triple-A), on the 40-man roster chopping block, or both. Those are exactly the kind of pitchers who shuffle around the league on waivers in the weeks leading up to Opening Day.     Walker Buehler (Padres), Austin Gomber (Texas Rangers), Marco Gonzales (Padres), and Cal Quantrill (Rangers) are veterans on minor-league contracts with an opt out at the end of spring training. If they don't get a big-league roster spot with their current teams, they could opt out, and which point the Braves could sign them for something close to the league minimum.     \nThat is more or less the scrap heap market. Waivers, veterans who opt out, etc. The Braves already have a few players like this in camp (Carrasco, Pérez, etc.) and may feel covered there, but Atlanta has some 40-man roster flexibility. They can throw a few darts throughout the spring and see whether anyone sticks. There's no risk in giving a player a spring audition.          Do nothing     Doing nothing is always an option, sometimes even a good one. Is a good option for the Braves? I'm inclined to say no -- I'd rather have too much pitching than not enough -- but, if you believe FanGraphs projections, the Braves have the 10th-best rotation in baseball even after baking in the Schwellenbach and Waldrep injuries. Tenth is not amazing, but it's not a disaster either.     Sale, Strider, López, Holmes, and Elder is a credible rotation and it's reasonable to expect Schwellenbach and Waldrep back later in the year giving the timing and nature of their surgeries. The risk is losing another starter and having to turn to Carrasco, Pérez, et al. The Braves are already pushing the limits of their depth. They don't have to add pitching now, but it would be wise.     \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 UEFA Women's Champions League is officially turning the page towards the quarterfinal round in March and April, live on Paramount+. After rewriting the tournament script with an 18-team Swiss model league phase, now just eight teams are left in the hunt for Europe's biggest prize. The newly shifted format of the competition produced exciting results, with some lopsided wins, exciting come-from-behind draws to salvage a point, and 181 goals during the league phase. Now it's time to plan for the quarterfinals. The quarterfinals will feature perennial powerhouses FC Barcelona and OL Lyonnes. The two sides dominated their opposition, and a three-goal differential proved the ultimate difference-maker in the standings heading into the quarterfinal phase. Manchester United and Arsenal join Chelsea FC as dominating English clubs in the next round, alongside Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, and Wolfsburg.Which teams are surging and which look untested? Time look at the results, the matchups and to rank the final eight Champions League teams:\nPlayoff resultsReal Madrid 2, Paris FC 0 (Real win 5-2 on aggregateArsenal 3, OH Leuven 1 (Arsenal win 7-1 on aggregate)Wolfsburg 2, Juventus 0 (Wolfsburg win 4-2 on aggregate)Man United 2, Atletico Madrid 0 (United win 5-0 on aggregate)Quarterfinal matchupsWatch all the action live on Paramount+.First legs to be played March 24-25, and second legs April 1-2Man United vs. Bayern MunichReal Madrid vs. BarcelonaArsenal vs. ChelseaWolfsburg vs. Lyon1. FC Barcelona  It's no secret that the Catalonians remain the team to beat in this tournament, topping the league phase with a plus-17 goal differential, and an opening 7-1 annihilation of Bayern Munich that sent defiant alarms throughout the competition. Carolina Graham Hansen, Alexia Putellas, alongside Claudia Pina and rising star Vicky Lopez, are getting it done flawlessly, with Aitana Bonmati on the sidelines with a leg injury.\n2. OL Lyonnes The eight-time winners flexed their champion experience, matched Barcelona's 16 points in the league phase, and showed they can put games away and rally from behind. Melchie Dumornay has officially reintroduced herself as a Ballon d'Or candidate with four goals (two braces) against Arsenal and Manchester United. Dumornay, alongside Kadidiatou Diani, Marie Antoinette Katoto, and Tabitha Chawinga, form an attacking quartet that strikes fear into every backline they face.3. Arsenal   The current title holders had a rocky start to their tournament but are now in solid form and back in familiar territory, the quarterfinals. Peaking at the right time is just part of the equation; scoring 88% of their open play goals off sequences in as few passes as possible makes them a dangerous side to face as the stakes get higher. New acquisition Olivia Smith is getting more lethal, and Alessia Russo is showing she's as reliable as ever in front of goal.4. Manchester UnitedDon't call them nervous newcomers, because the Red Devils keep proving they belong. They carried themselves with defensive performances in the league phase, and showed they know how to score during the knockout playoffs. Goalkeeper Phallon Tulis-Joyce of the U.S. women's national team and center back duo Dominique Jenssen and Maya Le Tissier have become a formidable defensive trio in front of goal.  \n5. Chelsea FCThe Blues earned a straight bye to the quarterfinals out of the league phase with four wins and two draws, and they matched Barcelona's 20 goals scored. They've hit a snag in form domestically, but there's no better reset than a run at the Champions League. The gradual return of Sam Kerr after a lengthy ACL absence adds another dimension to an attack highlighted by Alyssa Thompson's quick rise and skill on offense.6. Bayern MunichIt's tough to rank Bayern Munich outside of the top five but the beauty of a knockout phase highlights the more current form of other clubs, and while they earned their bye through to the quarterfinals after an embarrassing opening 7-1 loss to Barcelona, they won't be as battle tested when they go up against a rising Manchester United in the next round. 7. Real MadridAnother team that was difficult to put this low due to their recent efforts, but Real Madrid's too close for comfort performances combined with a quarterfinal match against their domestic rivals Barcelona, will force some adjusments.  Hopefully, they won't be too dramatic of changes, as Caroline Weir and Linda Caicedo are delivering right when it matters.\n8. VfL Wolfsburg The former two-time champions have quietly built their way back into the quarterfinal round. Veteran Alexandra Popp is still a game changer, with Lineth Beerensteyn and Janina Minge shifting as impact players game to game. The group performance has been fairly mixed, whether that's due to an attack that can sometimes generate, combined with a defence that can also concede. It highlights inconsistency, and that's not who you want to play heading into a quarterfinal against OL Lyonnes. \n            ",

Commissioner Adam Silver informed the NBA's general managers on Thursday that the league plans on making anti-tanking rule adjustments to take effect in the 2026-27 season, according to ESPN.While the league has yet to announce the exact measures it will take to combat tanking, it reportedly discussed over the last month seven potential rule changes. Some of the proposals reflect those suggested by fans in recent weeks as tanking became the NBA's most hot-button topic.The seven potential rule changes are as follows:Allowing protection of first-round draft picks only for selections in the top four or outside the top 14Freezing lottery odds at the trade deadline or laterPreventing teams to pick in the top four in consecutive years and/or after consecutive bottom-three finishesDisallowing teams to pick in the top four the year after reaching the conference finalsAllocating lottery odds based on two-year rolling recordsExtending the lottery to include all play-in teamsFlattening the odds for all lottery teamsAll of the proposals would reduce the incentive to intentionally tumble down the standings. Presently, the lower a team finishes, the higher odds it has in the draft lottery.\nAccording to ESPN, Mike Krzyzewski -- who serves as senior adviser to basketball operations -- was among those at Thursday's meeting with general managers who suggested that the league take steps to curb tanking attempts. Silver himself addressed the issue at his All-Star media availability last weekend and noted an increased prevalence of tanking.Phoenix Suns owner Mat Ishbia also called for \"massive changes\" in a social media post Thursday, calling tanking \"losing behavior.\"The current system is ripe for tanking behavior, and teams are becoming increasingly blatant in their attempts to maximize lottery odds. Last week, the NBA issued a $500,000 fine to the Utah Jazz for conduct detrimental to the league after investigating their lineup management in Feb. 7 and Feb. 9 games against the Orlando Magic and Miami Heat. The Jazz pulled star players Lauri Markkanen and Jaren Jackson Jr. prior to the start of the fourth quarter and did not reinsert them into the games despite holding leads.\nThe NBA also fined the Pacers $100,000 for violating the Player Participation Policy during a Feb. 3 contest against the Jazz after an investigation found that Pascal Siakam and two other starters who sat out could have participated under the league's medical standard.\n            \n",

    "body": "\n        Last week, the NBA fined the Utah Jazz $500,000 for \"conduct detrimental to the league\" and the Indiana Pacers $100,000 for violating the league's Player Participation Policy after both teams altered their lineups, either during or before games, to remove star players. In a statement accompanying the punishment, Adam Silver declared, \"Overt behavior like this that prioritizes draft position over winning undermines the foundation of NBA competition, and added, \"we are working with our Competition Committee and Board of Governors to implement further measures to root out this type of conduct.\"During his annual All-Star Weekend press conference, Silver expounded:\"I think we're coming at it in two ways. One is, again, focusing on the here and now, the behavior we're seeing from our teams and doing whatever we can to remind them of what their obligation is to the fans and to their partner teams. But number two, as I also said in that statement, the Competition Committee started earlier this year reexamining the whole approach to how the draft lottery works.\"Ultimately those teams, and just as a reminder that we're all in this together, that we want to have fair competition, we want to have fair systems and to keep an eye on the fans, most importantly, and their expectation that we're going to be putting the best product forward....\"Ultimately, we need a system to fairly, I think, distribute players. I think it's in the players' interest as well as the teams that you have a level of parity around the league. There's only so many jobs and so many cities. But we've got to look at some fresh thinking here. What we're doing, what we're seeing right now is not working; there's no question about it.\"The league is not waiting around to make changes. ESPN reported Thursday that Silver informed teams that tweaks will be in place for next season. Additionally, ESPN reported a series of ideas that have been discussed by the league's competition committee in late January and the 30 general managers at their meeting on Thursday:First-round picks can be protected only top-four or top-14+ Lottery odds freeze at the trade deadline or a later dateNo longer allowing a team to pick top four in consecutive years and/or after consecutive bottom-three finishesTeams can't pick top-four the year after making conference finalsLottery odds allocated based on two-year recordsLottery extended to include all play-in teamsFlatten odds for all lottery teamsI continue to be of the opinion, which I realize may be the minority, that tanking is not that big of a deal, and the league is overreacting to a unique confluence of events this season. Yes, the maneuvering has started earlier than usual, but the 2026 draft class projects as an all-timer, and multiple teams have protected picks they're desperate to keep. As long as the draft exists -- it's still hard to imagine it being abolished, even though the idea has gained some steam in the media lately -- the league cannot eliminate tanking, it can only determine how difficult it is for the worst teams to get the best picks. No one wants to tank, but the draft remains the most reliable way for the majority of teams to acquire top talent, so that's what they're going to do.And as I wrote last week, I don't think minor tweaks like the ones the leauge is reportedly considering are worthwhile. If anything, the 2019 decision to flatten the lottery odds has exacerbated tanking by creating more variance in the lottery results. The suggested changes would have similar unintended consequences. With that in mind, here is a rebuttal to each of the potential anti-tanking changes the league is considering. 1. Changing protections on first-round picksThis one feels like a direct response to the Jazz and Washington Wizards having top-eight protected picks and the Pacers' unique trade with the Los Angeles Clippers, in which they protected their first-round pick 1-4 and 10-30. \nEliminating protections altogether would be an interesting idea -- if the pick is gone no matter what, teams would have no incentive to alter their behavior -- but it's hard to see how limiting the way that picks can be protected will limit tanking, except perhaps in some specific cases. The Jazz and Wizards would still be tanking this season if they had a top-four protected pick. In fact, you could make a case that they likely would have done so even earlier and more aggressively than they did with a top-eight protected pick. Likewise, this rule wouldn't stop some teams with lottery-protected picks from making the calculation that they would be better off in the lottery than fighting for a first-round exit. 2. Lottery odds freezing at the trade deadline or later in seasonI don't understand this suggestion at all, to be honest. \nOne of the main complaints about this season is that teams have started tanking earlier than usual. Well, what would freezing the lottery odds at the trade deadline, or March 1, or any point prior to the end of the season do? Incentivize teams to start tanking as early as possible. If teams messing around with rotations and player availability in February is annoying, just wait until they're doing it in December. And then what? A bunch of teams play 30 completely meaningless games after the All-Star break? How is that good for the league or fans?3. No top-four picks in consecutive years and/or after consecutive bottom-three finishesFirst of all, this hasn't been that common of an occurrence since the league flattened the lottery odds in 2019. Since then, only the Houston Rockets (2021-24) and San Antonio Spurs (2023-25) have picked in the top four in consecutive years. \nThis is also the first suggestion that feels unfair. All drafts are not created equal, there is a massive difference in value between the No. 1 pick and the No. 4 pick and no draft pick is a guaranteed success. For example, the Atlanta Hawks got the No. 1 pick in the historically weak 2024 Draft and selected Zaccharie Risacher, who appears to be a rotation player in the NBA. If they had won the lottery in 2023 or 2025, they would have selected Victor Wembanyama or Cooper Flagg -- two franchise cornerstones. The Hawks were actually trying to win, even when they wound up with the No. 1 pick, but let's say they were in the middle of a rebuild. Under this rule, they would have been prevented from getting a top-four pick in the historically great 2025 Draft, compounding their misery. Not only did they have the bad luck of being in the top-four of a bad draft, they would have been locked out of the top-four of an excellent draft. Would that have convinced them to try and compete? Or incentivized them to tank for an extra year to get back into the top-four in 2026? The latter seems more likely. Now, let's look at the No. 4 picks since the league flattened the lottery odds in 2019:2019: De'Andre Hunter, Cleveland Cavaliers2020: Patrick Williams, Chicago Bulls2021: Scottie Barnes, Toronto Raptors2022: Keegan Murray, Sacramento Kings2023: Amen Thompson, Houston Rockets2024: Stephon Castle, San Antonio Spurs2025: Kon Knueppel, Charlotte HornetsSome very good players in that group, but likely none who would single-handedly alter the course of a franchise. And in what world should drafting Patrick Williams at No. 4, for example, disqualify you from being in the top-four of the following year's draft? How does that make any sense? Or, in Silver's words, ensure the draft would \"fairly distribute players\"?\nFinally, how would the process for kicking a team(s) out of the top-four in the second year actually work? Would the team(s) below them slide into their spot? In that case, teams who otherwise may have been unlikely to get into the top-four could start tanking to be in position to take a disqualified team's pick. 4. Teams can't make top-four picks right after making conference finalsThis is another one that's a pretty rare occurance. Since the league flattened the lottery odds, the 2020 Golden State Warriors and 2025 Dallas Mavericks are the only teams to pick in the top-four the year after making the conference finals. It may happen again this year with the Indiana Pacers. What do all those teams have in common? Something catastrophic happened to their franchise. \n2020 Warriors: Kevin Durant tore his Achilles in Game 5 of the 2019 Finals and left in free agency, Klay Thompson tore his ACL in Game 6 of the 2019 Finals and missed the entire season and Stephen Curry broke his hand five games into the season and never played again. They went 15-50 and got the No. 2 pick (James Wiseman) in the 2020 Draft.2025 Mavericks: Less than a year after the Mavericks made the Finals, Nico Harrison traded Luka Dončić to the Los Angeles Lakers for Anthony Davis, Max Christie and a first-round pick. Davis immediately suffered a long-term injury, Kyrie Irving tore his ACL and numerous other Mavericks went down during an injury crisis at the end of the season, which led to them falling into the lottery. They miraculously won the lottery and selected Cooper Flagg with the No. 1 pick in the 2025 Draft. 2026 Pacers: Tyrese Haliburton tore his Achilles tendon in Game 7 of the 2025 Finals and was ruled out for the entire 2025-26 campaign, Myles Turner left in free agency and the Pacers have been beset by injuries this season. Though not for a lack of effort, they are 15-41, and on pace for a top pick. This is another suggestion that feels unfair. Teams who make the conference finals aren't in a position to pick in the top-four of the next year's draft unless something went horribly wrong. In which case, there's no reason to double their punishment and create a truly lost season. 5. Lottery odds allocated based on two-year recordsThis is the system the WNBA has used since 2015, and there's no question that it has benefitted the worst teams. In fact, since the WNBA implemented this change, there have been five instances of a team winning the No. 1 pick in back-to-back years. (Though it's worth noting that until last year, there were only four teams in the WNBA lottery.) Three of those teams (Seattle Storm, Las Vegas Aces, New York Liberty) have gone on to win the Finals, while the Indiana Fever made the semifinals last season and the Dallas Wings are set to make their second consecutive top pick later this spring. If the primary goal is to more fairly distribute the top picks (talent) to teams that have been stuck at the bottom, the two-year aggregate lottery odds system would go a long way toward achieving that. \nBut would it prevent tanking? In certain cases, yes. Let's take a team that made the playoffs one season, then got off to a poor start the next season, had a few injuries and was hovering around the Play-In Tournament spots come the All-Star break. Said team would have less incentive to pack it in and try a one-off tank under this system. On the other hand, the two-year aggregate lottery odds system could incentivize a multi-year tanking plan when teams know there's a cant-miss prospect on the horizon. It's very easy to imagine some teams tanking multiple seasons in a row for a better chance at someone like Wembanyama or Flagg.The impact that one elite player can have in basketball is unique in team sports, and the draft remains the most reliable way for organizations, especially those in small markets, to acquire that level of talent. Franchises are going to do what it takes to put themselves in position for a top pick in a highly regarded draft, even if it means a multi-year rebuilding project. \n6. Lottery extended to include all Play-In teamsThis would solve for the issue of teams tanking late in the season to avoid the Play-In Tournament in search of some ping-pong balls. But is that worth adding four more teams into the lottery and further flattening the odds in the process? Or opening up the possibility of a No. 7 seed that won 48 games winding up with a top-four or top-six pick? No. Plus, how would adding the Play-In Tournament teams to the lottery have any impact whatsoever on what the teams at the bottom of the standings are up to? If this rule was in place this season, the Jazz would still be doing the exact same thing that got them fined $500,000. 7. Flatten odds for all lottery teamsPossibly the worst idea of them all, for two reasons. \nFirst, to the extent that tanking is a crisis at all, the situation was worsened by the league's initial decision to flatten the lottery odds in 2019, which has made it more difficult for the worst teams to get the top picks, thus forcing many of them into a state of perpetual tanking. In 2018, the worst team had a 25% chance at winning the lottery. Since 2019, the worst team has had a 14% chance at winning the lottery. Flattening the odds for all lottery teams would mean the worst team has a ~7% chance at winning the lottery -- the same as any other non-playoff team. Many teams have no choice but to rebuild through the draft, and it's very difficult to do so without getting at least one, if not multiple top lottery picks. Take the Wizards, for example. They haven't made the playoffs since 2021, but are on pace to finish with one of the five worst records yet again, largely because in the last four drafts, their highest picks have been No. 10, No. 7, No. 2 and No. 6. In a world with completely flat lottery odds, there's a very good chance their selections would have been even worse, and they'd be in an even deeper hole. \nSecond, this wouldn't eliminate tanking, it would only change where it was taking place. In Silver's statement regarding the fines for the Jazz and Pacers, he said that he handed out the punishment because those teams' behavior \"undermines the foundation of NBA competition.\" Guess what would be even worse for the foundation of NBA competition? Teams tanking their way out of the playoffs to get into a flattened lottery. Take the Orlando Magic for example. They're 29-25 and likely going to make the playoffs, but they've been banged-up all season and are probably heading for another first-round exit. If the lottery odds were flat this year, what would be better for their long-term future? Trying to sink into the lottery for a 7% chance at Darryn Peterson or losing in five or six games to the Detroit Pistons or New York Knicks? Would every borderline playoff team take that approach? No. But some of them definitely would, especially in years with a highly rated draft class. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 WNBA Draft is set for April 13, a little less than two months from now. Normally, we would just be finishing up WNBA free agency, and this would be the peak time for mock drafts. But due to the ongoing labor negotiations between the league and the WNBPA, we're still awaiting the double expansion draft for the Toronto Tempo and Portland Fire, let alone free agency. Most teams only have a handful of players in place for the 2026 season, and will have significantly different rosters a few weeks or months from now, whenever the offseason process is complete -- assuming, of course, that happens and the 2026 season goes ahead. Thus, in lieu of a new mock draft, a big board feels more appropriate. It's important to note that this is a ranking of the top 20 prospects, not a projection of draft order, which will depend significantly on each team's roster situation on draft night. As the college basketball regular season draws to a close, here is CBS Sports' 2026 WNBA Draft Big Board 1.0. \nTier 11. Awa Fam -- C, SpainFam is not a typical top prospect. In WNBA Draft history, eight international players have been selected in the lottery without playing college basketball, and only three of them have gone No. 1: Margo Dydek (1998), Ann Wauters (2000) and Lauren Jackson (2001). If the Wings select Fam, she would be the second-youngest player ever to go first overall. American hegemony has been the biggest factor in the lack of international lottery picks, but WNBA front offices have also prioritized a more finished product over potential. Why take a 19-year-old who might be awesome in a few years, when you can take a 22- or 23-year-old who could contribute right away? All of which makes this year's draft so fascinating. Fam has the most potential of anyone in this class, which is why she's No. 1 on the big board. She's 6-foot-4, athletic and versatile on both ends of the floor. She's also a few years away from being the best version of herself, and will need more time to develop than some of the other candidates to be the No. 1 pick.  \nHere, it's worth touching on Fam's numbers, which do not jump off the page: seven points, 4.8 rebounds, 1.3 assists and 1.2 steals on 57.9% shooting in EuroLeague Women action and 9.4 points, 4.9 rebounds and 1.5 assists on 60.6% shooting in Liga Femenina Endesa action. Valencia's roster is filled with current and former WNBA players, including Leonie Fiebich, Nia Coffey, Kayla Alexander and Yvonne Anderson. Fam only plays about 20 minutes per game, is not a primary offensive option and is competing against seasoned pros on a nightly basis. The majority of her touches come via the pick-and-roll or offensive rebounds, and she rarely has an opportunity to put her full skillset on display.  Fam's best moments with the Spanish national team, both at 2024 U20 EuroBasket, when she was named MVP, and at 2025 EuroBasket, when she helped her country win a silver medal, are more indicative of her unique talent and potential. \nFam is a willing jump shooter, both from the mid-range and 3-point line, but that area of her game remains a work in progress. Additionally, her defensive intensity and engagement need to be more consistent. She has all the physical tools to be an elite defender, but will float on that side of the ball at times. StrengthsPaint scoringPick-and-roll finishingPassingAthleticismWeaknessesDefensive intensityPerimeter shooting2. Olivia Miles -- G, TCUMiles would have been a lottery pick last year if she had entered the draft, but she decided to return to school and transferred to TCU, where she's been able to run the show in Mark Campbell's spread pick-and-roll system. In just a few months in Fort Worth, Miles has proven that she's more than capable of being an offensive engine. Miles is a truly elite passer and one of the best playmaking prospects to enter the league -- certainly in the last few years, and maybe ever. She has incredible vision, is extremely creative and can make high-level passes with both hands. Whether it's in transition, out of the pick-and-roll or isolation, she is always looking to set up her teammates. While she can be turnover-prone and overambitious at times, those are traits you can refine. You cannot teach her innate playmaking gifts. \nThroughout this season, Miles has become much more of a scoring threat than she ever was at Notre Dame. She has three 30-point games, including a career-high 40-point outing on the road in a win over Baylor. And despite a career-high usage rate (27.9%), Miles also boasts a career-high true shooting percentage (61.6%). She's taking nearly 80% of her field goal attempts at the rim or from behind the 3-point line, and is shooting 66.4% at the rim and 36.3% from behind the arc. Going back to last season, we now have a 60-game sample of Miles shooting 38.7% from downtown. At this point, her 3-point shooting has to be considered a strength, which is remarkable considering she was at 24.6% across her first three seasons in college. The most obvious weakness for Miles is her defense. It is downright bad at times, and needs to improve. She does have good steal numbers (1.9 per game, 3.1% steal rate), but she often stands too upright rather than getting into a stance, and is prone to losing track of her opponent off the ball. \nStrengthsPassingPick-and-roll playmakingGetting into the paint3-Point shootingWeaknessesDefenseDecision makingTier 23. Azzi Fudd -- G, UConnFudd is another player who could have declared for the draft last year, but despite being named Final Four Most Outstanding Player after helping UConn win a national championship, she chose to use her extra year of eligibility (granted due to a medical redshirt) to return to school. Fudd made the right choice. She would have gone in the first round last year, but now she might be the No. 1 overall pick. Plus, she'll enter the league on a much more lucrative rookie-scale deal once the new collective bargaining agreement is sorted. It is not hyperbole to call Fudd one of the best pure shooting prospects ever. (In 2018, a then-15-year-old Fudd was the first girl ever invited to Stephen Curry's SC30 Select Camp and won its 3-point contest, beating all the boys.) She's making 46.3% on 6.5 attempts per game this season, and is a career 42.3% shooter from behind the arc. Her form is perfect, her release is lightning-quick and her off-ball movement is always on point. Fudd will immediately be one of the best shooters in the WNBA from Day One. \nThough primarily discussed as an offensive prospect, Fudd is an underrated defender, particularly off the ball. She has very solid fundamentals and a high IQ, which means she's almost always in the right spot. Her aggressiveness on that end of the floor has also improved, and she's averaging a career-high 2.4 steals per game. Fudd does need to improve as an on-ball creator to maximize her upside. Over 43% of her field goal attempts this season have been catch-and-shoot 3s, she rarely gets to the rim or free throw line and she is not a high-level playmaker. Additionally, Fudd's injury history is a concern. She's torn her right ACL twice, her right MCL and her right meniscus, and also had a stress reaction in her right foot. Strengths3-point shootingOff-ball defenseCuttingWeaknessesOn-ball creationInjury history\n        \n            \n                Courtside scouting report on Azzi Fudd: What we learned from watching UConn star, possible No. 1 pick up close\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n4. Lauren Betts -- C, UCLABetts, the reigning Naismith Defensive Player of the Year and Big Ten Tournament Most Outstanding Player, is one of the most divisive prospects in this class. Once seen as a potential No. 1 pick, that no longer seems likely, but she's going to be a lottery selection. \nAt 6-foot-7, Betts will be one of the biggest players in the WNBA. Last season, only 15 players taller than 6-foot-4 appeared in at least one game, and only one of them -- 6-foot-9 Brittney Griner -- was taller than Betts. A size advantage doesn't guarantee success, but it's a good place to start. Betts' size and defensive instincts make her a tremendous rim protector. Since transferring to UCLA as a sophomore, Betts has never averaged fewer than two blocks per game and boasts an 8.6% block rate for her career. And those numbers don't account for the shots she alters or discourages altogether. Furthermore, Betts rarely fouls despite challenging so many shots. She's never averaged more than 1.8 fouls per game, and has never fouled out in 121 career appearances. While Betts is an elite paint presence, she struggles to defend in space just like most players her size. She's not a complete stiff out there, but she's going to have to play drop coverage at the next level, which will limit her team's defensive flexibility. \nBetts doesn't offer much outside of the paint on offense either. She should be a better screen setter given her stature, and though she's been more willing to attempt mid-range jumpers this season, she's only taking about two per game, and is making 35.2% of them. Around the basket, Betts is a strong offensive rebounder and a highly efficient finisher (71.3% at the rim this season). There are times when she struggles to impose her will, however, especially against opponents who can match her strength, which leads to some extremely awkward possessions. Due to her size, Betts often sees double teams and has grown significantly as a passer. She has a good feel for the game and is willing to kick the ball out to open teammates. StrengthsSizeRim protectionDefensive instinctsEfficiency around the basketWeaknessesDefending in spaceLimited offensive game5. Flau'jae Johnson -- G, LSUJohnson was yet another player who opted to return to school instead of turning pro last year. She wanted to try and lead LSU to another national championship (she was a freshman when the Tigers won it all in 2023) while improving her craft and leadership skills. \nJohnson's decision to take another year in Baton Rouge may prove worthwhile in the long run, but in terms of her draft standing, it's fair to wonder if she would have been better off turning pro last spring. Her senior season has been a bit of a roller coaster, especially since SEC play began. She's had some big games against top competition like South Carolina and Oklahoma, but also four single-digit scoring outings, including a disastrous scoreless night against Vanderbilt, during which she was benched in the second half. It's easy to find yourself changing your opinion on Johnson from game to game. Johnson has a unique ability to create her own shot and is more than willing to shoot off the dribble. When her mid-range shot is falling, it's extremely difficult to stop her, but she's prone to cold spurts. She's never been a super high-volume 3-point shooter, but she's shot over 38% from behind the arc in each of the last three seasons, and is making a career-high 43.5% of her attempts this season. Because she's a reliable catch-and-shoot threat, that opens up her dribble drive game. When Johnson drives, she's often able to beat her first defender, but that's when the problems can arise. She's extremely right-hand dominant as a finisher and doesn't always make the best decisions when she gets into the paint. In her defense, LSU has the second-lowest 3-point rate (20.3%) in the country, and its spacing is horrible. There's a very good chance Johnson looks significantly better as a finisher at the pro level with more space to work with. Like most prospects, Johnson is largely discussed from an offensive perspective, but she has the tools to be a valuable defender as well. Her size (6-foot) and athleticism allows her to defend multiple positions on the perimeter, she's an active defensive playmaker and she's willing to crash the glass. StrengthsIndividual shot creation3-point shootingAthleticismDefensive versatilityWeaknessesDecision makingHalfcourt finishing Consistency\n        \n            \n                Flau'jae Johnson scouting report: Breaking down LSU star and 2026 WNBA Draft prospect's scoring repertoire\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTier 36. Kiki Rice -- G, UCLARice has continually improved throughout her collegiate career at UCLA, and has been one of the biggest risers this season. Aside from her assists, which are down slightly from last season, she's putting up career-highs across the board for the No. 2-ranked Bruins. Rice has long been known for her stout perimeter defense. Standing 5-foot-11, she has excellent size for a point guard, and she uses her length, athleticism and quick hands to hound opposing ball-handlers. She will routinely just take the ball from whoever she's guarding. Off the ball, she reads the game well, which allows her to jump into passing lanes. Additionally, she is a very good rebounder for her size, and can help control the glass.Rice's offensive improvements are why she's made a big jump as a WNBA prospect. She is relentless getting downhill, and is taking nearly 60% of her field goal attempts in the paint. Though she does need improve her finishing at the rim, she gets to the line often and shoots nearly 90% on foul shots. Her ball-handling is superb, which allows her to navigate congested areas of the floor, and she's a solid playmaker who doesn't make many mistakes. Perhaps the biggest question with Rice is whether her 3-point shooting can scale to a higher volume. She's gone from 21.7%, to 31.2% to 36.5% to 41.9% during her time in Los Angeles, but has never taken more than 2.7 attempts per game. It's great that she's continually made a higher percentage, but are teams going to respect her as a shooter?StrengthsPerimeter defenseAbility to get into the paintBall-handlingWeaknessesRim finishing3-point volume7. Ta'Niya Latson -- G, South CarolinaLatson led the country in scoring last season with 25.2 points per game, and never averaged fewer than 21 points in her first three seasons at Florida State. She was not going to contend for a title with the Seminoles, however, so she transferred to South Carolina for her senior season to play for Dawn Staley. As expected, Latson's numbers have taken a big hit on a far deeper and more talented Gamecocks team. Her usage rate is down from an absurd 38.2% last season to 23.4% this season, she's taking eight fewer shots and averaging 10 fewer points. A nagging left knee injury hasn't helped matters, and she's currently playing with a bulky brace. Latson is one of the best transition threats in the country and an elite downhill driver. Her ability to get to the rim is truly remarkable, especially given her size (5-foot-8). Nearly half (47.1%) of her field goal attempts come at the basket, and she finishes 67% of them. Her determination to get to the rim also earns her plenty of trips to the free-throw line, where she's an 80% shooter. Latson has never been a high-volume 3-point threat, but she has been a reliable spot-up shooter in college. When Latson puts her head down, she is primarily looking to score at the rim and doesn't have much of an in-between game. And while she's not a bad playmaker, it's not her strong suit. Because she had such a heavy scoring load at Florida State, she was not expected to be a high-level defender. Staley and the Gamecocks coaching staff have worked with her in that department, but her defense is still an area of improvement.StrengthsTransition scoringGetting to the rimDrawing foulsCatch-and-shoot 3sWeaknessesPlaymakingIn-between gameDefensive intensityTier 48. Gabriela Jaquez -- G, UCLANow in her second year as a full-time starter for UCLA, Jaquez is enjoying a breakout campaign that has seen her shoot up draft boards. She's putting up career-highs across the board save for assists, and has been extremely efficient on the offensive end. Jaquez has an incredible motor and is one of those players who seems to be at the right place at the right time. She's constantly making hustle plays to earn her team extra possessions, whether that's coming up with a loose ball or grabbing an offensive rebound. Crucially, Jaquez has also made a big leap as a 3-point shooter, up from 34.8% last season to 42% on 3.4 attempts this season. There's probably not a ton of upside with Jaquez, who doesn't create her own offense or do much playmaking, but she has a high floor as a role player, especially if her 3-point improvement is real. StrengthsCuttingEffortPaint finishing3-point shootingWeaknessesCreating her own offensePlaymaking\n        \n            \n                'Shooters shoot': How Gabriela Jaquez's breakout season and vocal leadership are powering UCLA's title hopes\n                \n                    Isabel Gonzalez                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n9. Nell Angloma -- F, FranceAngloma looks likely to be the latest Frenchwoman drafted in the first round, following Dominique Malonga (No. 2, 2025), Carla Leite (No. 9, 2024) and Leïla Lacan (No. 10, 2024). Add in Janelle Salaün, who was an undrafted rookie last season with the Golden State Valkyries, and there's suddenly a very impressive young French contingent in the WNBA. Angloma is a big, athletic wing who excels at getting downhill into the paint, where she can finish with either hand. There are times when she gets a bit out of control, but the vast array of shots she's capable of making at the rim, both in transition and in the halfcourt, is very impressive. To this point, Angloma is not a reliable 3-point shooter, though she is willing to take them. Additionally, she has a negative assist-to-turnover ratio in the LFB (domestic French league) this season and needs to take better care of the ball. She is only 19, though, and has significant room to grow. StrengthsDownhill drivingWeak-hand finishingAthleticismWeaknessesShootingTurnovers10. Gianna Kneepkens -- G, UCLAKneepkens spent the first four years of her collegiate career at Utah before transferring to UCLA for her fifth and final season to try and compete for a national championship. She's proven to be a strong addition to Cori Close's side, which has only lost once and will likely have at least four first-round picks. Almost any other year, Kneepkens would be regarded as the best 3-point shooter in the class, but she had the bad luck to come out at the same time as Fudd. Kneepkens is shooting 45.3% on 5.3 attempts per game this season, and is a career 43.6% shooter. Her release is unorthodox and not super quick, but she rarely misses, especially when she's open. And while she's primarily a 3-point shooter, she's hyper-efficient from all over the floor. Perhaps the biggest question for Kneepkens is about her athleticism, or lack thereof. Will she be able to hang defensively on the perimeter in the pros? And offensively, will she have enough off-the-dribble juice when teams run her off the line? Strengths3-point shootingOverall efficiencyOff-ball movementWeaknessesUnorthodox releaseAthleticismDefense11. Raven Johnson -- G, South CarolinaFew players have benefitted as much from an extra year of college eligibility as Johnson. She had a very disappointing 2024-25 season, but has bounced back with the best campaign of her career for the No. 3-ranked Gamecocks, and now looks like a likely first-round pick. Johnson's calling card has always been her perimeter defense. She is a menace on that side of the ball. Despite only standing 5-foot-9, she boasts a 6-foot-2 wingspan and has an incredible motor and instincts. She's willing and able to pick up opponents full-court, has quick hands and is not afraid of physicality. Johnson will be able to walk into the WNBA and defend from Day One.  Johnson's offensive output has always been the biggest concern, but she's averaging career-highs in points (10.2), assists (5.4) and 3-point percentage (36.8%) this season. She's only taking 2.5 3s per game, and shot a combined 30.1% over her first three seasons, and will need to prove her improved shooting is real, or teams will ignore her off the ball. StrengthsPerimeter defenseMotorTransition scoringDecision makingWeaknesses3-point shootingOffensive consistencyTier 512. Janiah Barker -- F, TennesseeNo player in this class has a bigger gap between their best moments and their worst moments than Barker, who transferred to Tennessee and is now at her third school in three years. There is no question about her talent. She's 6-foot-4, can put the ball on the deck like a guard and shoots a respectable percentage from behind the arc. The upside is obvious, and is why she still ranks so high despite a lack of consistency throughout her career. 13. Cotie McMahon -- F, Ole MissMcMahon, who transferred to Ole Miss after playing her first three seasons at Ohio State, is what the kids would call a dawg. She's an undersized forward who doesn't score efficiently outside of the paint, and it's fair to wonder how her game will translate to the next level. However, she's extremely tough and physical with a relentless motor, and there's always a place in the league for players like that. 14. Madina Okot -- C, South CarolinaA native of Kenya, the 6-foot-6 Okot has only been playing basketball since 2020. She's a force on the glass, finishes well around the rim and makes a lot of plays defensively. There are times when her athleticism and defensive potential really pop. There are others when it's obvious she's only played a few years of high-level basketball and still needs more time to develop. 15. Iyana Martín -- G, SpainThe 19-year-old Martín, the EuroLeague Young Player of the Year in 2025 and U19 World Cup MVP in 2023, would likely be a draft-and-stash candidate. She is a playmaking savant who can throw every pass in the book, and in terms of pure passing ability may be second only to Miles in this class. Her 3-point shooting has fallen off a cliff this season, which is a concern. She also has a slight frame and needs to improve defensively. Tier 616. Charlisse Leger-Walker -- G, UCLALeger-Walker missed more than a full calendar year with a torn ACL and will turn 25 in September, but at this stage of the draft you're not worried as much about upside. She knows how to run an offense, likes to bully her way into the paint and is shooting a career-high 36.1% from 3-point range this season.  17. Marta Suarez -- F, TCUTCU is Suarez's third team during her six-year college career, and she's shot up draft boards amid a terrific season for the Horned Frogs. Teams are always looking for stretch fours, and Suarez is making a career-high 36.2% of 5.5 attempts per game this season. If the shooting is real, Suarez will stick in the league. 18. Maggie Doogan -- F, RichmondEven after leading Richmond to the second round of the NCAA Tournament last season, Doogan flies under the radar as a mid-major star. She's an incredibly skilled forward, who's flirting with a 50/40/90 season, and her offensive versatility will make her a fit for any roster. 19. Tonie Morgan -- G, KentuckyAfter three seasons at Georgia Tech, Morgan transferred to Kentucky and could be the latest point guard that Kenny Brooks sends to the WNBA. Morgan is leading Division I in assists per game this season and is a skilled pick-and-roll playmaker, though she can be turnover-prone at times. She doesn't put up huge numbers as a scorer, but she's efficient. 20. Serah Williams -- F, UConnWilliams has become something of an afterthought since transferring to UConn this season, but she was a double-double machine at Wisconsin and the 2024 Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year. It will be interesting to see how teams evaluate her, but she still has value as a rangy, defensive-minded big. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Canada hockey star center Sidney Crosby has been ruled out of Friday's Olympic semifinal against Finland after exiting his team's Olympic quarterfinal win over Czechia with a lower-body injury, the team announced. Crosby was hurt in the second period Wednesday following an awkward sequence along the boards.In his absence, Connor McDavid will serve as captain for the semifinal, with Nathan MacKinnon and Cale Makar wearing alternate captain letters.Over the course of a single shift midway through the second period, Crosby took a stiff shot from Czechia defenseman Radko Gudas in the neutral zone and got crunched between Gudas and Martin Necas along the boards. The second hit appeared to be the one that injured Crosby as he labored getting off the ice before immediately seeking assistance from medical staff on the bench.\nThe Canadian trainer examined Crosby on the end of the bench for a few moments before accompanying him to the locker room. Crosby displayed a noticeable limp down the tunnel.\nCanadian coach Jon Cooper said the team used Crosby's injury as a rallying cry heading into the third period. Canada notched a dramatic 4-3 overtime win, which included a comeback late in regulation.\nEntering the game on Wednesday, Crosby was tied for second on the Canadian team in points with six. Fortunately for Canada, the team's center depth is still exceptional with the one-two punch of McDavid and MacKinnon as the headliners down the middle.What could this mean for Team Canada?On top of the implications for Team Canada, this could be a significant development for Crosby's career. Now 38 years old, Crosby would be 42 in 2030, which means this may have been his last opportunity to play on the Olympic stage. Crosby already has his iconic Olympic moment -- the \"Golden Goal\" in 2010 -- but he was looking for one final run in 2026.\nLosing Crosby for the rest of the tournament, while not devastating, would be a tough blow for the Canadians. Although Canada would still boast the most talented roster in Italy, Crosby remains among the best players in the world, and he is one of just two members of the team (along with Drew Doughty) with Olympic experience.Crosby's potential absence doesn't crater Canada's gold medal chances after surviving an overtime scare from Czechia in Wednesday's quarterfinals. Crosby is still an elite two-way player, he gave Canada absurd center depth and he is the rare NHL player with prior Olympic experience. All that said, the Canadians are still the favorites to win this tournament. Connor McDavid and Nathan MacKinnon -- perhaps the two best players in the world -- give the team a knockout out-two punch at center. Canada will replace Crosby in the lineup with Sam Bennett, a two-time Stanley Cup champion and the reigning Conn Smythe Trophy winner. That's the definition of elite depth.\nWhat could this mean for the Penguins?In addition to the entire nation of Canada, the city of Pittsburgh will be holding its breath as everyone awaits a more definitive update on Crosby. The heart and soul of the Penguins franchise since his rookie season in 2005-06, Crosby has the team in the thick of the playoff race this season.One of the NHL's biggest surprises, the Penguins are 29-15-12 and sit in second place in the Metro Division, thanks in large part to the efforts of Crosby. He leads the team in goals (27), assists (32) and points (59). When it comes to goals and points, no one else on the team is particularly close. Crosby is the straw stirring the drink in Pittsburgh.If Crosby is forced to miss significant time, the Penguins would go from Stanley Cup dark horse to first-round cannon fodder, assuming they didn't drop out of the playoff picture altogether. A long-term injury to Crosby would also force general manager Kyle Dubas to make some split decisions at the March 6 trade deadline. If Crosby is sidelined, might Pittsburgh choose to sell?\nWhat could this mean for future Olympics?The return of the NHL to the Winter Olympics has been such a joy to watch, but as we saw on Wednesday, the risk of star players being injured is ever present. Los Angeles Kings star Kevin Fiala already suffered a season-ending injury playing for Swizterland, and now Crosby was hurt wearing a Canadian sweater. NHL players already had to fight for their right to make an Olympic return in the latest CBA negotiations. The current CBA is set to expire in September of this year, but a new deal that has already been agreed upon will kick in and runs through the 2029-30 season. That deal also includes Olympic participation, but could we see more pushback from the owners starting in 2034? When a superstar like Crosby goes down in a game with no bearing on the NHL standings, there are ripple effects throughout the league.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NFL Week 10 schedule features several division rivalries, including Bills vs. Dolphins, Seahawks vs. Cardinals and 49ers vs. Rams. The Bills have dominated the Dolphins in recent years, winning each of their last seven meetings against Miami, which includes a 31-21 win in Week 3. This time around, the Bills are favored by 9 points on the road, according to the latest Week 10 NFL odds. The over/under for this AFC East rivalry is 50 points, the highest on the Week 10 NFL schedule. The Bills feature the NFL's top-ranked offense, averaging 385.5 yards per game, and SportsLine's model is backing Buffalo to record a convincing victory and cover the spread in 55% of simulations.The model is also backing the Seahawks (-6.5) to cover the spread at home against the Cardinals, and Under 49.5 points to be scored in 49ers vs. Rams. Before locking in your Week 10 NFL picks, be sure to check out the top NFL betting picks from SportsLine's advanced computer model. New users can also target the all-new DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets and three free months of NBA League Pass:The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

Bet it now at Caesars Sportsbook: Bills (-9) vs. DolphinsThe Bills boast the NFL's top-ranked offense, and they've been spectacular on the ground, averaging 161.5 rushing yards per game, which also ranks first in the NFL. Meanwhile, the Dolphins' offense has struggled in recent weeks, scoring just six points in two of their last three games. The model is projecting the Bills to record a double-digit victory on Sunday, helping Buffalo cover the spread in 55% of simulations.Seahawks (-6.5) vs. CardinalsThe Seahawks are coming off a dominant win over the Washington Commanders. Quarterback Sam Darnold completed 87.5% of his passes for 330 yards and four touchdowns in the victory. Seattle has also dominated this NFC West rivalry over the years, winning eight consecutive meetings against Arizona. In addition, the Seahawks are 7-1 against the spread in their last eight games against the Cardinals. SportsLine's model is backing Seattle to cover the spread in 56% of simulations, targeting the Seahawks as one of its top Week 10 NFL picks. Rams vs. 49ers: Under 49.5 pointsThese two NFC West rivals squared off on Oct. 2, combining for 49 points in a 26-23 overtime victory for San Francisco. Both teams struggled to run the ball in that contest, as the Rams and 49ers both finished with fewer than 80 rushing yards. History also indicates this game could finish below the total. That's because the total has gone Under in nine of Los Angeles' past 12 games when playing on the road against the 49ers. SportsLine's model is projecting these teams will combine for 45 points on Sunday, helping the Under hit in 63% of simulations.Want more Week 10 NFL picks?You've seen the model's Week 10 NFL best bets for Sunday.

Remember, Jones was at the helm of that surprising 26-23 OT win over the Rams at So Fi last month, passing for 342 yards in the process,\" legendary handicapper Bruce Marshall said. \"Proving remarkably resilient his season, the Niners have remained in the NFC West race despite many key injuries, including on defense. SF is maximizing resources as good as any team in the league. If there is one problem for the Rams, and it cost them dearly in the earlier loss to the 49ers, it's the kicking game, and to that end a desperate Sean McVay is turning to a new PK, Harrison Mevis, to take the place of the erratic Joshua Karty.\" Back San Francisco at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Under 49.5 points in Commanders vs. Lions (-120)\"The Commanders suffered a big blow with the loss of Jayden Daniels, and I'm not sure how the offense responds in a tough matchup here after they had no success vs. Seattle with their QB1. The offense has actually been struggling for weeks if you consider they only managed 22 against Dallas and 24 against Chicago, two defenses who have been lit up in recent games,\" CBS Sports Gambling and Fantasy editor R.J. White said. \"Detroit's offensive line has its own issues with the interior losing multiple players recently and both tackles picking up injuries that may keep either or both sidelined in this matchup. That should keep the Lions focused on a possession offense and running the clock down, making it hard for this game to get to 50.\" Back the Under at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Steelers money line vs. Chargers (+125)The Chargers are 6-3 on the season and have won three of four, but were fortunate to escape with victories against the lowly Titans and Dolphins during that span. They were also beaten handily by the Colts (38-24) in their last matchup against a team with a winning record. Meanwhile, the Steelers just captured a 27-20 win over Indianapolis to move to 5-3 and are 2-1 on the road this season, which includes a road win over the 7-2 Patriots.

The Week 10 NFL schedule is loaded with must-see matchups, including the first-place Seahawks against the Cardinals, a rematch of a postseason matchup last season in Commanders vs. Lions, and Chargers vs. Steelers on Sunday Night Football.Picks from all three of those games will be among our Sunday NFL best bets from SportsLine's team of experts and the SportsLine Projection Model. Claim the latest FanDuel promo code, where new users get $150 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: Check out our FanDuel promo code review for full details.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters Week 10 on a sizzling 47-29 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.  Sunday NFL best bets at FanDuel SportsbookOver 44.5 points in Seahawks vs. Cardinals (-114)Lions -7.5 vs. Commanders (-115)Steelers +2.5 vs. Chargers (-102)Combining the model's three picks into a three-leg parlay at FanDuel would result in a payout of +595 (risk $100 to win $595). Bet it at FanDuel here:\nOver 44.5 points in Seahawks vs. Cardinals (-114)\"The Seahawks are 3-1 to the Over at home this season, and have scored 27+ points in 5/8 games. The Cardinals offense has been far more efficient with backup QB Jacoby Brissett at the helm,\" SportsLine NFL expert Daniel Vithlani said. \"Both defenses will be missing a number of starters- Arizona is down starting CBs Max Melton & Will Johnson, along with LBs Mack Wilson & B.J Ojulari. The Seahawks will likely be without LB Ernest Jones and CB Josh Jobe. I expect a competitive game that goes over the total with a 27-24 type of score.\" Back the Over at FanDuel Sportsbook:Lions -7.5 vs. Commanders (-115)\"We've suspected all season that the Commanders were about to fall into the abyss. Now, with Jayden Daniels out again, it's up to Marcus Mariota, who has fared poorly since the Raiders game in September, tossing just 3 TD passes vs. 4 picks across his next three outings,\" legendary handicapper Bruce Marshall said. \"Moreover, the defense has sagged, run off of the field last Sunday night by the Seahawks in Seattle 38-14 romp. The Lions should be hungry, not only off of a rare loss, but also in a revenge mode after being knocked out of the playoffs by the underdog Washington last January, 45-31. There is plenty of offense on the Detroit side to make amends.\" Back Detroit at FanDuel Sportsbook:Steelers +2.5 vs. Chargers (-102)The Chargers are 6-3 overall, but they've failed to cover the spread in five of their last six games. The Steelers, on the other hand, have covered the spread in four of their last five games and should be riding high after knocking off the Colts as underdogs last week. The Los Angeles offensive line has been decimated by injuries, with Joe Alt and Rashawn Slater both suffering season-ending injuries. T.J. Watt should feast and that's a big reason why the model predicts that the Steelers cover in 53% of simulations. Back Pittsburgh at FanDuel Sportsbook:\nWant more Sunday NFL picks?You've seen some of the model's best bets for Sunday.

    "body": "\nOne of the biggest matchups taking place in Week 10 of the 2025 NFL season is a showdown between a pair of NFC West rivals battling for the top spot in the division. The San Francisco 49ers (6-3) look to sweep the season series when they host the defending division champions Los Angeles Rams (6-2) at 4:25 p.m. ET. San Francisco posted 26-23 overtime victory in Week 5 at Los Angeles, which has won three consecutive games and is even with the Seattle Seahawks atop the NFC West.For Sunday's matchup between the Rams and 49ers, top sportsbooks have set the rushing yards prop for San Francisco's Christian McCaffrey at 63.5 yards, while Puka Nacua of Los Angeles has his receiving yards prop set at 91.5. Before you play a side on McCaffrey, Nacua or any player prop for Week 10 of the NFL season, you need to see what SportsLine player prop expert PropBetGuy has to say. The expert is +388 on his last 19 NFL player prop picks. Here are his analysis and picks.Rachaad White Over 3.5 receptions (-111, DraftKings)White once again is in line to start for the Buccaneers in place of the injured Bucky Irving.White has cleared this receptions line in three of his last five games and is poised to see a heavy dose of targets against New England. The Patriots allow the second-most targets (7.11 per game), the most receptions (6.11) and the highest target rate (22%) to opposing running backs.The Patriots are very tough against the run, and also against wide receivers in the passing game. I have Baker Mayfield peppering White with six targets. I'd bet this line up to -115.Devin Singletary Over 33.5 rushing yards (-112, FanDuel)In a surprise twist in Week 9, Singletary out-snapped teammate Tyrone Tracy in the absence of Cam Skattebo.Singletary rushed eight times for 43 yards while Tracy had five carries for 18 yards in a largely negative game script. Even with a more balanced workload, I expect Singletary to clear this line in a matchup against the Bears' 25th-ranked run defense (per FTN's DVOA).In addition, windy and potentially snowy weather in Chicago could put a damper on the passing game. I'd bet this up to Over 36.5 rushing yards.Zach Charbonnet Under 49.5 rushing + receiving yards (-114, FanDuel)The Seahawks backfield rotation is frustratingly fluid, but I'm looking to fade Charbonnet on his rushing plus receiving yards line.He's been Under this total in six of seven games and is coming off his lowest snap share of the season at 37%. Kenneth Walker III has been the more efficient back and once again should have first crack at the workload.Plus, the Cardinals are above average in running back yards allowed. I'd bet this down to Under 47.5 yards.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        After weeks of griping after losses and even playing the officiating card following the Duke debacle, Clemson coach Dabo Swinney was considerably more chipper after Saturday night's 24-10 win over Florida State. It was the Tigers' first victory at home against a Power conference opponent since the middle of the 2024 season, snapping the longest losing skid of Swinney's career at Memorial Stadium and keeping Clemson's bowl hopes alive.For the first time at home since a Week 2 win over Troy, the Clemson (4-5, 3-4 ACC) defense looked like the unit most expected it would with several potential first-rounders leading the charge at the line of scrimmage. The Tigers forced two turnovers, frustrated Florida State quarterback Thomas Castellanos throughout and held one of the the ACC's top rushing attacks to just 110 yards.\"I'm just so happy for them (seniors) to be able to taste that tonight and to be able to celebrate with them,\" Swinney said. \"And I know it hasn't been a great season record-wise, but I don't care what the records are, it don't ever get old to beat the Noles. And it ain't ever easy to beat the Noles, ever.\"Season-ending stretch for ClemsonClemson travels to Louisville Friday night before finishing out the season against Furman and a trip to South Carolina. If the Tigers lose to the Cardinals, they'll need victories over the Paladins and Gamecocks to continue their bowl streak under Swinney. Clemson, however, has new-found swagger after what the defense showed against Florida State.\n\"That was the No. 1 offense in the conference coming in here. Really explosive. Really run the football,\" Swinney said. \"One of the top ten rushing offenses. One of the best scoring offenses, scoring 40 points a game. And so I'm really proud of our defense.  Season-low 10 points. Season-low rushing for them. Season-low yards for them. Six sacks.\"We did a lot of good things. Two takeaways. Caught a couple of breaks, too. With some drop balls, which we were really fortunate on. But they just hung in there and they battled.\"Clemson has never missed bowl season under Swinney. The Tigers went 6-5 under Tommy Bowden in 2004 but declined a bowl invitation following a brawl involving multiple players at the end of a 29-7 victory over South Carolina during rivalry weekend. Bowden stuck around 3.5 more years until Swinney took over during the second half of the 2008 campaign prior to the interim tag being removed after beating the Gamecocks.\nClemson finished with a losing record only six times in the last 50 years, once coming under Swinney.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        COLUMBIA, Mo. — After his teammates waved goodbye to Missouri's student section, Reuben Owens climbed onto the bench for a better look at the mass exodus pouring out of Faurot Field.He spotted a chirping, mic'd-up Mizzou student and pointed toward the nearest exit.\"Go home!\" Owens barked twice before hopping back down.\"Bro,\" the student shot back, \"I want to watch you play!\"Too late, buddy. Owens' day was already done.No. 3 Texas A&M (9-0, 6-0 SEC) had just slammed the door on No. 22 Mizzou (6-3, 2-3) with Owens' second touchdown run late in the game. The 38-17 score may look routine on paper, but the moment was anything but for an A&M program that has cratered in November over the years, leading to easy fodder for rivals to chew and spit back in their face.Saturday marked A&M's first SEC road win in November since 2020, snapping a seven-game skid. It was also their third straight road victory in league play this season and their second consecutive blowout of a ranked opponent.\nOne win doesn't define a season, but a 9-0 start -- the program's first since the storybook 1992 run -- carries weight. It quiets the noise. It shifts the conversation. It forces people to stop invoking November ghosts.\"Is this our weekly 'last year' question?\" Elko deadpanned Saturday. \"I don't know about the past. I know that's four road games this team has gone on the road and won. We're 4-0 this year on the road. We've only got one left, so we'll finish this year with a winning record, if my math is right. I'm just proud of how these guys went out and did that.\"Texas A&M missed on the 1992 national championship by a whisker.  \n                                                                    CBS Sports Research\n                                                            Indeed, the Aggies appear to be a legitimate SEC and national title contender heading down the stretch for the first time in their history. On a Saturday when another unbeaten (No. 7 BYU) fell on the road, and No. 2 Indiana needed last-minute heroics to beat Penn State, the Aggies strolled through hostile territory, took control and never let go.\nQuarterback Marcel Reed strengthened his case for Heisman Trophy consideration with another strong a smooth performance, throwing for 221 yards and two touchdowns on 20 of 29 passing. He also picked up a couple of crucial first downs while rushing for 29 yards on five carries.Owens had a team-high 102 yards and two touchdowns on 13 carries, and also caught two passes for 10 yards. Receiver K.C. Concepcion was a magician to put the game out of reach on third down, sliding past defenders on a quick screen and zipping through the middle of the Tigers' defense for a 48-yard touchdown that gave the Aggies a 21-0 lead early in the third quarter.Missouri fought back late, but the game had already tilted. A&M's fronts owned the second half, steamrolling for 220 rushing yards after being out-gained 91-23 on the ground in the first half. Owens supplied both fourth-quarter touchdowns.\n\"We started putting our will on their will, they got tired, they got fatigued,\" Owens said. \"That's what coach told us at halftime. He said it's going to come; just be patient.\"The Aggies' defense finished with seven tackles for loss and two sacks, frustrating first-time starter Matt Zollers, the freshman who started the season as the Tigers' third-string quarterback but was forced into action this week because of injuries. He completed only 7 of 22 throws for 77 yards, the fewest completions by a Missouri quarterback since 2016. On one sack, Zollers was stripped by linebacker Daymion Sanford as he reared back to throw. Safety Dalton Brooks returned the fumble to the 2-yard line, and two plays later the Aggies grabbed a 14-0 lead with only 20 seconds remaining before halftime.\nBrooks also fooled the Tigers on a fake punt, snagging a direct snap in at A&M's own 34-yard line, and sprinting 48 yards to help set up a field goal and 24-7 lead. Elko said he got aggressive with the call after Mizzou pulled within 21-7 and had forced the Aggies into a three-and-out situation. However, Mizzou overloaded one side of the formation, a tactic many opponents have employed against the Aggies, and so he made the call. \"They're not sound against fake. … We felt like we had an opportunity if the right time presented itself and we took it.\"You can bet the Aggies' defense came into Week 11 motivated after the first set of College Football Playoff rankings was released Tuesday. Committee chairman Mack Rhoades said there was a clear line separating Texas A&M from reaching the likes of No. 1 Ohio State and No. 2 Indiana.\"When we included A&M as part of the discussion, we felt like the separator there was the defense,\" Rhoades said Tuesday.\n\"It motivated us a lot,\" Sanford said. \"We talked about it a lot yesterday and coming into the game, we kinda had that chip on our shoulder like, 'Why are they really disrespecting our defense?' And we came in with a great mindset; ultimately, we shut them down.\"Mizzou was held to 284 yards, including the season-low 77 yards passing. The 21-point loss was its largest of the season, dropping the Tigers to 0-3 against ranked teams and torpedoing their already slim playoff hopes.For A&M, it's time to start thinking about what's possible. Only one ranked team remains on the Aggies' schedule -- a trip to rival Texas in the season finale -- and they control their own destiny in the SEC and playoff races. They also avoid Alabama on the regular-season schedule, making the path that much easier to secure their first trip to Atlanta.\n\n        \n            \n                College football Week 11 overreactions: National title game matchup set, Oregon not championship caliber\n                \n                    Will Backus                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nOn a day when road wins were hard to come by across the country, the scene in Columbia was a reminder of just how far this program has come in short order under Elko. He's 6-2 in road games, far removed from the late-season curses of Jimbo Fisher and Kevin Sumlin.As the 2-minute timeout arrived in the fourth quarter, most of the stadium had emptied. Sandwich wrappers and popcorn buckets rustled through the empty rows as a cold front swept through town. In Section 101, in the far corner, the 12th Man roared. Thousands of maroon-clad fans didn't budge from their stronghold, overwhelming any noise left to be made by the scattered Tigers.Reed sprinted up the grass berm toward their open arms when the game ended. Concepcio followed, wearing a white hard hat, slapping hands and posing for photos with fans after yet another monster performance. He eventually huddled with his father, Kevin, who had followed his son from NC State to Texas A&M in the offseason for moments just like this.\n\"It's been amazing all season,\" Kevin Concepcion said. \"Nine-and-oh. South Carolina, here we come.\"Only three undefeated teams remain among the sport's power conferences: the Aggies, as well as the Big Ten's Ohio State and Indiana. Next up for Texas A&M is a return home for the first time in more than a month to host South Carolina. Their road woes in the rearview mirror and only road game remaining, the Aggies are on the best path they've ever had in the SEC.\n\"I don't know what ultimately that means from a result standpoint, but the culture of this group is really strong,\" Elko said. \"The work they put into this thing is really strong, and they believe in each other, and they believe in what we're doing. That shows up a lot on the road in these hostile environments.\"\n            ",

The clause prohibits Green Bay from trading their pass rusher to the NFC East, notably the Eagles after they tried to land the multi-time All-Pro during his summer holdout. The Packers would owe the Cowboys their 2028 first-round draft pick if Green Bay moves Parsons to Philadelphia, Washington or New York. The \"poison pill\" condition is also featured for Kenny Clark, who was part of the package from the Packers to the Cowboys. If Dallas trade Clark to a team from the NFC North, the Packers get the Cowboys' 2028 first-round pick.The \"poison pill\" stipulations reportedly apply to this season and 2026. This parameter was not discussed publicly when the Parsons blockbuster materialized, but NFL teams reportedly noticed that were conditions attached to the Cowboys' and Packers' 2028 first-round picks that prevented them from being traded.The Cowboys' \"all-in\" trade this week for Jets defensive tackle Quinnen Williams spiked the \"poison pill\" conversations when Dallas' future 2028 first-round was prohibited from trade discussions.\nParsons, a four-time Pro Bowl edge rusher, agreed to a four-year, $188 million deal with Green Bay that included $120 million guaranteed after the trade. In exchange for Parsons, the Cowboys received two-first round picks — one in 2026 and another in 2027 — along with Clark.ESPN previously reported that the Eagles made a \"strong play\" for Parsons once the Cowboys began entertaining trade offers over the summer. Jones and the Cowboys were not willing to send Parsons to their NFC East rival. Parsons and the Packers play the Eagles on Monday night, so it's not coincidence his contract detail has surfaced ahead of kickoff. Parsons has 20 tackles and 6.5 sacks for the Packers this season. Green Bay (5-2-1) leads the competitive NFC North, which includes every team at .500 or better.\n\"These last six months were super draining, super toxic for everyone,\" Parsons said after his debut in Green Bay earlier this season. \"It's something that I don't think no player should have to go through. Players' fates should be decided earlier. The fact that I was traded a week before the season was really outrageous and rough. It's something where I could have been with these guys getting better and better, and we probably could have had probably an even more dominant start if that was the decision they were going to make.\"\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Who's scoring today? That's what every NFL gambler wants to know. Anytime touchdown wagers have become one of the most popular bets these days, whether you're constructing a parlay or looking for a long shot.Last week, I cashed on THREE of my top five picks. Carolina Panthers running back Rico Dowdle found the end zone at +220, Denver Broncos rookie running back RJ Harvey did as well at +350, and then Buffalo Bills quarterback and reigning NFL MVP Josh Allen cashed at +105. Let's see what I have cooking for this week. Bet anytime touchdowns at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $150 in bonus bets with a winning $5 bet:Below, we will break down five anytime TD bets to consider for Week 10. These will not be predictable choices like Derrick Henry or Jonathan Taylor, but they won't be wild long shots such as a team defense. Let's begin with the NFL game in Berlin on Sunday morning. \nOdds: -135Jonathan Taylor and Bijan Robinson will meet in Germany as two of three players in the NFL with 1,000 scrimmage yards entering Week 10. Taylor is an absurd -320 to find the end zone, so let's go with the other star running back in Robinson. I like this bet for two reasons. One, Robinson is a dynamic threat who can score on the ground or through the air, and two, he hasn't scored a touchdown in two games after scoring in three straight contests. The point is -- he's due. There are people out there who believe the Indianapolis Colts will easily cover against the Falcons in this international game. I'm not so sure.\nOdds: -185The weather at Soldier Field on Sunday is going to be nasty. Weather.com predicts the high will be 37 degrees with 20 to 30 mile-per-hour winds. That means Chicago is going to rely on its No. 2-ranked rushing attack with D'Andre Swift and Kyle Monangai.Swift (-185 anytime TD) has scored touchdowns in the past four games he's played in (he missed last week due to injury), so let's bet on Monangai. He's coming off a career-high 176 rushing yards vs. the Cincinnati Bengals, and he found the end zone in the Bears' last home game against the New Orleans Saints.\nOdds: +120I think the play of J.J. McCarthy vs. the Detroit Lions last week was very surprising. I did not see him upsetting Dan Campbell's squad coming off a bye at home. In that game, Jefferson caught his second touchdown of the season, and I think he can take advantage of a bottom-five pass defense. Maybe bet the over on his longest reception as well. \nOdds: +140Despite the loss last week, LaPorta tied a season high with six receptions for 97 yards and a touchdown vs. the Vikings. I feel like the Lions are about to unleash hell on the spiraling Washington Commanders -- who have struggled to cover tight ends this year (along with everyone else). I went back and looked, and sure enough, Washington has allowed touchdowns to tight ends in THREE straight games -- including two from Jake Ferguson in Week 7. \nOdds: +105Saquon at plus money? Yes, it's true. So get on this before it changes. Barkley finally got back on track vs. the New York Giants last week, rushing 14 times for 150 yards and a touchdown. He also caught four passes for 24 yards and another score. The Green Bay Packers are favored over the Eagles, which confuses me since Philly is healthy and coming off a bye. Nick Sirianni has never lost coming off a bye, by the way. Barkley scored touchdowns in half of his games played last year, so this is a good bet. \n            ",

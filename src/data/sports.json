    "body": "\n        LSU is firing fourth-year coach Brian Kelly, CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz reports. The move comes after the Tigers failed to deliver on high expectations in a disappointing 2025 season. The 64-year-old Kelly is in the midst of a 5-3 season in Baton Rouge. His buyout of $50-plus million will be the second most ever paid to a college football coach.   A contentious Sunday of meetings in Baton Rouge culminated in Kelly's exit. CBS Sports had previously reported that Kelly arrived at the football facility in the morning with the expectation of firing offensive coordinator Joe Sloan:Kelly, 64, arrived at the facility around 8:30-8:45 a.m. local time intent on evaluating his staff and, according to sources, exploring significant potential changes to the coaching staff. By early afternoon, though, after a meeting with Woodward that did not go well, according to sources, the conversation around Kelly's future began to change. Multiple staff members told CBS Sports that Kelly left the facility shortly thereafter.The day ends with Kelly's ousting. Running backs coach Frank Wilson will be the interim coach. A 30-day transfer portal window for LSU players will open Monday (the NCAA's single window for this cycle is Jan. 2-16). The high-profile leadership change by athletics director Scott Woodward, who made the splashy hire of Kelly in 2021, is the latest in what has already been a whirlwind of a coaching carousel cycle. LSU jumps toward the front of the line of programs seeking a home-run hire, along with Penn State, Florida, Virginia Tech and numerous others at the Power Four level. Woodward, by the way, is the same AD who hired Jimbo Fisher to Texas A&M -- setting the stage for Fisher to receive an all-time-rich $76.8 million buyout. Louisiana governor Jeff Landry was involved in the deliberations, sources told CBS Sports. Landry called out the football program after Saturday night's 49-25 loss to Texas A&M, tweeting that LSU needed to \"rethink their actions to raise ticket prices for next year after tonight's showing!\"\nTwo of the highest-paid buyouts ever have occurred this month.  \n                                                                    CBS Sports Research\n                                                            With its sights set on reaching the College Football Playoff, LSU invested heavily in its roster through the transfer portal and loaded up on talent with the No. 1-ranked class in the cycle, per 247Sports. That recruiting push indicated LSU was all-in on competing for an SEC championship and its first CFP berth of the Kelly era. The Tigers' defense improved significantly with the influx of instant-impact playmakers, but in a reversal from previous years, it was the offense that struggled to hold up its end of the bargain this season. LSU is averaging its fewest points per game since 2009 and its fewest yards per game since 2011. To fall short of lofty expectations, and to do so for a fourth time in as many years, was the final straw for Kelly to end his reign in Baton Rouge. The angst around the LSU program reached palpable levels with the Week 9 loss to No. 3 Texas A&M. Chants of \"Fire Kelly\" echoed throughout Tiger Stadium as LSU squandered a halftime lead and fell in blowout fashion to the Aggies in a 49-25 loss. LSU has a bye this weekend and then plays at rival Alabama. \nLSU's recruiting class for the 2026 cycle ranks No. 11 overall, per 247Sports. In 2025 the Bayou Bengals signed a No. 7 class that ranked higher before the decommitment from No. 1 recruit Bryce Underwood, who has started every game at QB for Michigan this fall. Kelly's buyout ranks among the largest in college football. Programs have not been deterred by colossal buyouts in this hectic cycle, though, and LSU is the latest to eat a sizable chunk of money to make a change. The athletic department owes Kelly more than $52 million for parting ways with him during the season. The buyout calls for Kelly to receive 90% of the salary owed through the remainder of his contract, which measures $52,380,000 at season's end.   Most expensive buyouts in college football history\nRankCoachSchoolBuyout1Jimbo FisherTexas A&M$76.8 million2Brian KellyLSU$53.8 million3James FranklinPenn State$49 million4Gus MalzahnAuburn$21.4 million5Billy NapierFlorida$21.2 million6Charlie WeisNotre Dame$18.9 million7Willie TaggartFlorida State$18 million8Ed OrgeronLSU$16.9 million9Tom AllenIndiana$15.5 million10Tom HermanTexas$15.4 millionBecause LSU fired Kelly in the middle of the campaign, it must also pay him 90% of the remaining $9.4 million salary owed for the 2025 season. Who's next at LSU?Any coaching search that Scott Woodward has his hands on should involve a slew of big-hitters. For better or worse, that's the type of hire he goes after. That's why names like Lane Kiffin and James Franklin are in the list of LSU's candidates, according to CBS Sports' Chris Hummer. Three major wild cards will draw attention, though (copy via Hummer). Jimbo Fisher: I know suggesting Fisher here seems absurd. But remember it's Woodward who hired Fisher at Texas A&M and believed in him to such a degree he gave Fisher a historically lucrative contract to lure him from Florida State. Fisher's star has obviously dimmed. But Woodward actively pursued Fisher when he conducted LSU's search in 2021. Fisher has deep ties to LSU and is a national championship-winning coach. It's a marriage that makes a lot of sense if you can ignore Fisher's last two seasons in College Station.Dabo Swinney: Swinney is amid his worst season as Clemson's head coach since 2010. Could Woodward follow his Texas A&M playbook and lure a national champion to Baton Rouge? Swinney is a proven program builder and would seem to fit in at LSU culturally in a way Kelly never managed to. If Swinney wants a fresh start, you could pick much worse places than Baton Rouge to do so. But like Fisher, you must wonder if Swinney would be a sexy enough hire at this point in his career.Nick Saban: It was only earlier this week when Saban said, \"I want to stay retired.\" But if there was a non-Alabama job that could tempt Saban, it'd be LSU, the place he won his first national championship. Would he take the job if offered? Probably not. But Woodward's history tells you he'll at least ask.  Breakthrough season evades Brian Kelly LSU is a proud program with national championship expectations (its three prior coaches won one) and thus faced inherent risk when it hired Kelly ahead of the 2022 season. The longtime Notre Dame coach failed to get over the championship hump at his previous spot and only once reached the CFP. The same troubles followed him to LSU and were ultimately what spelled the end of his tenure. Never did the Tigers win more than nine regular-season games under Kelly's leadership. They generally hovered near SEC title contention but regularly fell just short, losing at least two conference games in each of Kelly's four years at the helm. Particularly frustrating for the Tiger faithful was to see the program fall short of championships despite a terrific run at the quarterback spot with Heisman Trophy-winner Jayden Daniels and future NFL Draft pick Garrett Nussmeier. \nLSU peaked at No. 3 in the AP Top 25 this season, reaching its highest ranking of the Kelly era. The Tigers climbed into the top 10 in each of his four years, indicating that they often came close to earning a playoff berth but had their hopes dashed by untimely losses.  Brian Kelly faces crossroads in coaching career One of the biggest questions facing Kelly moving forward is whether he will seek a new job or hit the pause or stop buttons on his career. The 64-year-old may have his pick of multiple jobs given the widespread movement on the coaching carousel but could also emerge as a more attractive target in future cycles if he takes time off. If Kelly were to spend the 2026 season away from the sidelines, it would mark his first year without a head coaching job since 1990, before he made his debut. This is the first time in Kelly's career that he has been fired. He left each of his previous stops -- Grand Valley State, Central Michigan, Cincinnati and Notre Dame -- to accept offers elsewhere. \nKelly went 34-14 at LSU and has a career mark of 297-109-2 spanning all of his five jobs. He won two Division II national championships at Grand Valley State and reached the BCS National Championship Game once during his Notre Dame tenure. 2025 coaching carousel spinning at historic rateKelly is the 12th head coach fired this year and is the 10th in-season. The 10 coaches fired before November is the most in the FBS era (since 1978). Additionally, Kelly is the eighth power conference head coach fired this season. Only four of that variety were canned a year ago. The current number of eight -- and there's a ways to go -- is the most since 2022. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        An already crazy college football coaching cycle kicked up a level to insanity Sunday evening as LSU made the jaw-dropping decision to fire Brian Kelly after a 5-3 start to 2025, triggering a $50-plus million buyout in the process. Kelly wasn't unsuccessful in Baton Rouge. He finished his tenure at 34-14 overall. But he never made the playoff or came close to winning a SEC championship. Expectations will be incredibly high for whoever succeeds Kelly, following one of the more shocking firings in recent memory. These are a few candidates that make sense in Baton Rouge after talking with industry sources. \nTop candidatesLane Kiffin, HC, Ole MissAlready at the center of one blueblood coaching search, Kiffin could find himself in the middle of three SEC heavyweights. The Rebels want to resign him. Florida wants him to be its next head coach. Now, Kiffin is the most popular name when you talk with industry sources about potential replacements in Baton Rouge. Kiffin has all the requisite experience to succeed in the SEC, showing the ability to elevate the Rebels into an annual SEC contender. Kiffin would be a plug-and-play replacement for Kelly, someone whose offensive acumen could instantly elevate the Tigers. Joe Brady, OC, Buffalo Bills The one-time 29-year-old offensive coordinator of the 2019 LSU national championship team, the now 36-year-old Brady has a half-decade of NFL experience and is a rising head coaching candidate in those circles. Brady's been hesitant to return to college in the past, but would one of the best coaching jobs in the country be enough to lure him back to the place he first began his ascent? Penn State is also looking at Brady this cycle. James Franklin, former Penn State coachFranklin is the most qualified coach on the open market despite his split from Penn State earlier this year. He's won 68% of his games as a head coach, leading Penn State and Vanderbilt to remarkably successful runs. But would LSU really go hire another coach from the Midwest with few ties in the Southeast? I'm not sure it's a hire that would excite the fan base. \nJon Sumrall, HC, TulaneA former SEC linebacker who's worked in the Southeast his entire career, Sumrall has done nothing but win since emerging as a head coach in 2022. He went 23-4 in two seasons with Troy, and he's now 15-6 in a season-and-a-half with Tulane. There's no hotter name among Group of Five head coaches, and Sumrall is expected to be deeply in the mix if the Auburn job were to come open. But would LSU really want to hire Tulane's head coach? I'm not sure if it would create enough of a splash.Marcus Freeman, HC, Notre DameIf you look at LSU athletic director Scott Woodward's history of hiring head coaches in any sport, there's one commonality – he makes big swings. He landed Jimbo Fisher at Texas A&M. He lured Kelly away from Notre Dame. Could he convince another head coach to leave South Bend? Industry sources haven't slammed the door shut on Freeman being a candidate at Florida, and you could argue LSU is the better job. It still seems rather unlikely Freeman would leave Notre Dame for anywhere but the NFL. But if Woodward is going to make a run at somebody, he might as well swing big. It's CRAZY But … Jimbo FisherReunited and it feels so good! I know suggesting Fisher here seems absurd. But remember it's Woodward who hired Fisher at Texas A&M and believed in him to such a degree he gave Fisher a historically lucrative contract to lure him from Florida State. Fisher's star has obviously dimmed. But Woodward actively pursued Fisher when he conducted LSU's search in 2021. Fisher has deep ties to LSU and is a national championship-winning coach. It's a marriage that makes a lot of sense if you can ignore Fisher's last two seasons in College Station. \nDabo Swinney, HC, ClemsonAgain, big swings. Swinney is amid his worst season as Clemson's head coach since 2010. Could Woodward follow his Texas A&M playbook and lure a national champion to Baton Rouge? Swinney is a proven program builder and would seem to fit in at LSU culturally in a way Kelly never managed to. If Swinney wants a fresh start, you could pick much worse places than Baton Rouge to do so. But like Fisher, you must wonder if Swinney would be a sexy enough hire at this point in his career.  Nick SabanLook, I did say crazy. It was only earlier this week when Saban said, \"I want to stay retired.\" But if there was a non-Alabama job that could tempt Saban, it'd be LSU, the place he won his first national championship. Would he take the job if offered? Probably not. But Woodward's history tells you he'll at least ask. \n            ",

Byron, who earned his third win of the season, third at Martinsville and the 16th of his Cup career, overcame a 36 point deficit to the Championship 4 cut line to join Denny Hamlin, Chase Briscoe, and Hendrick Motorsports teammate Kyle Larson in next week's championship race at Phoenix.After two previous potential winning efforts in the Round of 8 went awry late in those races -- colliding with a lapped car coming to pit road at Las Vegas and spinning out of the pack coming to the finish line at Talladega -- Byron made a statement by winning the pole at Martinsville, then leading 304 of 500 laps. But in order to make the Championship 4, Byron had to run down Ryan Blaney in a run to the finish that amounted to a head-to-head fight between drivers who had to win in order to make it to Phoenix.\n        \n            \n                NASCAR playoffs 2025 race schedule, results: Complete list of Cup Series race dates, winners, tracks\n                \n                    Steven Taranto                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nByron made his move with 43 laps to go, moving Blaney off of the bottom groove in turn 1 to take the lead.

They did so, earning the right to try and become a championship team.\n\"Things have a way of working out. God really tests your resilience a lot of times, and we've been tested,\" Byron told NBC Sports. \"Unbelievable. I'm out of breath ... I am just so thankful, excited to see my family, and just celebrate this one. We obviously go to Phoenix and just try to go kick ass there.\n\"You just work so hard, all these guys work so hard, and you put everything into Sundays. And sometimes, you don't get anything in return, and that's been the last couple weeks and honestly throughout the year we've had some close calls. Sometimes life is that way. But you've just got to keep being resilient, and we were, and it just feels damn good.\"Blaney finished second, but it would be all for naught as he, Chase Elliott, Christopher Bell and defending Cup champion Joey Logano were eliminated from championship contention at the end of the Round of 8. Elliott finished third with Ross Chastain fourth, Kyle Larson fifth, Ryan Preece sixth, and then Bell, Logano, Todd Gilliland and Josh Berry rounding out the top 10.After the two were separated by just a single point entering Martinsville, Larson was able to successfully outpoint Bell, becoming the final driver to make the Championship 4 by seven points. But with Byron's win bumping the cut line down, it meant Bell had his heart ripped out for the second year in a row, having entered Martinsville with a 37-point advantage on the cut line only to be eliminated from title contention.\n\"We had good enough track position all day that we were kind of out of the mess, I guess,\" Larson told NBC Sports. \"... Happy for [William], happy for our team, happy for Hendrick Motorsports. This went as good as it could've for us, to score more points than Christopher and then have William or Chase win, too. Glad we can give Mr. H an opportunity next week, and hopefully one of us can win it.\"\"Just seemed  like we were lacking a little bit of long run pace,\" Bell told NBC Sports. \"I felt whenever we  got the balance close at times I could take off on tires and do okay and  make some passes, maintain my position. Then the consistent theme of  the day was just falling backwards as the tires got old.\"We just  weren't strong enough at Martinsville this weekend. We practiced in the  teens, we qualified in the teens, and kind of raced back there most of  the day. I feel content with the results. I think the four going there  are legitimate contenders. Whoever the champion is, it's going to be  well-deserved. The 20 team wasn't good enough.\"\nThe Championship 4 will pit the two Hendrick cars of Byron and Larson against two Joe Gibbs Racing cars driven by Denny Hamlin and Chase Briscoe, both of whom failed to finish on Sunday after suffering engine failures. Of that group, only Larson has previously won the Cup championship, having won the crown in 2021.With three rounds of playoff racing now in the books, next week's NASCAR Cup Series Championship Race at Phoenix Raceway comes down to a pure match race between the four drivers who have made the final round. Whoever among the Championship 4 drivers has the best finish in the Championship Race will become the 2025 NASCAR Cup Series champion.\nXfinity 500 results#24 - William Byron#12 - Ryan Blaney#9 - Chase Elliott#1 - Ross Chastain#5 - Kyle Larson#60 - Ryan Preece#20 - Christopher Bell#22 - Joey Logano#34 - Todd Gilliland#21 - Josh Berry#45 - Tyler Reddick#54 - Ty Gibbs#8 - Kyle Busch#88 - Shane van Gisbergen (R)#2 - Austin Cindric#3 - Austin Dillon#41 - Cole Custer#23 - Bubba Wallace#7 - Justin Haley#6 - Brad Keselowski#42 - John Hunter Nemechek#99 - Daniel Suarez#48 - Alex Bowman#71 - Michael McDowell#38 - Zane Smith#10 - Ty Dillon#47 - Ricky Stenhouse Jr.#16 - A.J.

We're up to eight openings in the power conferences midway through the 2025 season --  and that doesn't count Stanford, where Frank Reich was named interim coach in March. Only five power jobs came open all of last season, when 30 total jobs (25 in the Group of 6) were filled.  Overall, the two years leading up to this cycle (2025-26) were the most hectic we've seen this century, with a total of 61 programs changing head coaches. That means an incredible 44.9% of FBS teams changed leadership during a two-year span.

    "body": "\n        FOXBOROUGH, Mass. -- The cherry that was supposed to sit on top of TreVeyon Henderson's breakout day was merely six yards away. During New England's final possession (excluding kneels) in the club's 32-13 win over the Browns, the rookie back took a second-down handoff from the Cleveland 9-yard line. As he rumbled and stumbled closer to the goal line, he fumbled. The Browns recovered, erasing the scoring opportunity.\"You know, it's a learning lesson,\" Henderson said of the turnover after the game. \"It's tough to go out like that, but that's something we've been harping on all season, just taking care of the ball. That's something that we've got to continue to work on.\"The fumble itself was inconsequential. New England already had the victory in the bag with a 30-13 lead and just under five minutes to play. Furthermore, Browns quarterback Dillon Gabriel was called for intentional grounding in the end zone just two plays later, which resulted in a safety. No harm, no foul, but a lesson in ball security nonetheless. \nEven as this was admittedly a sour note to end on, Henderson's mini-breakout shouldn't go unnoticed. After serving as a depth piece on the roster through the first seven weeks of the regular season, Henderson found himself in a much more competitive split with starter Rhamondre Stevenson in terms of carries (14 vs. 10). \nA week after logging just two carries for five yards against the Tennessee Titans, Henderson carried the ball 10 times on Sunday for 75 yards. Those rushing totals, which were by far a season-high, came against a Browns defense that had held opponents to just 3.3 yards per carry (tied for No. 1 in the NFL) coming into Week 8. Week (Opponent)CarriesRushing yardsWeek 1 (vs. Raiders)527Week 2 (at Dolphins)310Week 3 (vs. Steelers)1128Week 4 (vs. Panthers)732Week 5 (at Bills)624Week 6 (at Saints)927Week 7 (at Titans)25Week 8 (vs. Browns)1075Henderson flashed his explosiveness early, taking the second offensive snap of the day 12 yards on a second-and-8 handoff from Drake Maye. \nA few plays later on the opening field goal drive, he broke off an 18-yard scamper on a toss to get New England on the doorstep of the red zone. \nHenderson could prove to be an X-factor for one of the hottest teams in the NFL as they look toward the second half of the regular season. When drafted in the second round of the 2025 NFL Draft out of Ohio State, he was billed as a home-run hitter as both a pure runner and receiver out of the backfield. While that ability flashed in the preseason, it had yet to truly emerge in the regular season -- until Sunday's win suggested a bigger breakout could be on the horizon\"I've definitely been getting more comfortable as the season's evolved,\" Henderson said. \"Getting more reps, getting more opportunities, different looks, and going up against different players.\" Henderson also has a favorable road ahead with New England squaring off against some beatable run defenses. For instance, their next opponent, the Atlanta Falcons, were in the bottom half of the league in rushing yards allowed coming into Week 8 and just let Dolphins backs combine for 141 yards on the ground, albeit on 37 carries. The New York Jets (Week 10), Cincinnati Bengals (Week 12), and New York Giants (Week 13) are all bottom 10 rushing defenses as well. Of course, Stevenson will still be a major factor in the running game and command the lion's share of touches for the time being, but the opportunity is there for Henderson to use this showing as a springboard into becoming a late-blooming force for the Patriots down the stretch. \n            ",

He was a big part of the Broncos holding the normally high-powered Dallas offense in check; Denver led 27-10 at halftime.Though he doesn't have the ball production he had last year -- zero interceptions this season after four last year -- Surtain has been his normal excellent self. He is yet to allow a touchdown this season as the primary defender, and entering Week 8, he had allowed just a 48.5% completion rate, seventh-best among 76 players who had been the primary defender on at least 30 passes.\nSurtain missed just two games in his first four seasons in the NFL. With him missing time, Riley Moss and first-round rookie Jahdae Barron would be more under the spotlight; Barron had an interception on the Cowboys' final offensive play of the first half.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Cleveland Browns defensive end Myles Garrett made history in the first quarter of their eventual Week 8, 32-13 loss to the New England Patriots. On a third-and-goal, Garrett got to Patriots quarterback Drake Maye for the sack. It was sack No. 108.5 for Garrett, moving him past NFL legend Reggie White for the most sacks before turning 30.It was the first of what ended up being a franchise-record five sacks for Garrett. He became the first player to lose a game with five sacks since Derrick Thomas in 1990, and the first ever to lose a game by more than four points while recording five sacks in a game. \nTrue to form, a frustrated Garrett told reporters after the game that he would throw away his whole individual performance for a win. Garrett already passed 2025 Hall of Fame inductee Jared Allen this season who was previously second on the under-30 list with 105 sacks. Passing White's 108 was is an impressive feat for Garrett, who doesn't turn 30 until Dec. 29 so he'll have eight more games after Sunday's game to extend his record. Garrett is already up to 10 sacks on the season. It's the eighth season in a row Garrett has reached double-digit sacks, which is tied for the second-longest streak all time. \nWhat will become interesting to watch now, is seeing how high Garrett can climb on the all-time sacks list. He entered Sunday 46th all-time, but he's likely to make a significant push and challenge the elites in the category in the coming seasons. White finished his Hall of Fame career with 198 sacks over 15 seasons. If Garrett has the longevity White had, and remains the dominant force he has been he'll have a chance to supplant him and possibly even be the first player to ever record more than 200 sacks.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Another week, another full slate of NFL action nearly in the books. And Week 8 has been chock-full of drama.Saquon Barkley finally rediscovered his big-play touch against -- who else? -- the New York Giants. The Cincinnati Bengals, who upset the Pittsburgh Steelers with a prime-time shootout back in Week 7, found themselves on the wrong end of a similarly high-scoring affair. The Drake Maye-led New England Patriots stayed hot to win their sixth game in eight weeks. And the Buffalo Bills got back on track with a major victory over the Carolina Panthers, who were without Bryce Young under center.Other surprises on Sunday: C.J. Stroud and the Houston Texans enjoyed a splashy win over the San Francisco 49ers despite battling a slew of their own injuries, the Baltimore Ravens avoided a slide to 1-6 while awaiting Lamar Jackson's return, and the Atlanta Falcons stood no chance against the Miami Dolphins, even with Kirk Cousins getting a shot to lead the team off the bench.Which players, coaches and teams stood out as the biggest winners (or losers) of Week 8? Here goes:\nWinner: Jonathan Taylor's MVP caseA year after Barkley cruised past the 2,000-yard mark, the Indianapolis Colts star is on pace for an almost equally dynamic season as the centerpiece of Shane Steichen's suddenly imposing attack. The veteran running back was averaging close to 17 yards per carry (!) just over halfway through a rout of the Tennessee Titans, and he's been money all year as Daniel Jones' offensive sidekick.\nLoser: Spencer RattlerThis isn't solely, or even primarily, because the young quarterback was unplayable as the New Orleans Saints' starter, but rather that he was basically set up to fail as the trial-run passer for Kellen Moore's rebuild. Speaking of Moore, he finally made the switch to rookie Tyler Shough against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, essentially turning the page on Rattler's scrappy, if unspectacular, run.\nWinner: Sean PaytonWhat a week for the Denver Broncos coach. Days after deflecting a rare Russell Wilson outburst, Payton didn't just stick it to the Dallas Cowboys, who apparently courted Payton multiple times over the course of his esteemed career; he outright embarrassed them, leading Bo Nix and Co. to a one-sided victory over a superior roster even with top defender Patrick Surtain II banged up.\nLoser: Dak PrescottThe Cowboys quarterback was understandably drawing MVP buzz coming into Week 8, consistently feeding CeeDee Lamb and/or George Pickens to help offset Dallas' porous defense. Then he ran into the Broncos defense, which made him look downright silly with two picks in a 44-24 blowout. The 'Boys wouldn't be near .500 without Dak, but this was an ugly day of decisions for the vet.Winner: Tyler HuntleyThe Baltimore Ravens got into trouble by improperly indicating Jackson might return from his hamstring injury against the Chicago Bears. But Huntley, who's now on his third stint with the club, stepped up in the former MVP's absence, completing his first nine throws and also scurrying for 50+ yards on the ground to help the Ravens snap a four-game slide and rout the Chicago Bears.Loser: Raheem MorrisA few weeks ago, Morris' Atlanta Falcons looked as if they might be on the verge of sneaking into the NFC South mix, showcasing a feisty defense in an upset of the Buffalo Bills. That \"D\" was nowhere to be found against the lowly Miami Dolphins, who rediscovered their aerial efficiency in a blowout win. Not even Bijan Robinson could save Atlanta's injury- and penalty-plagued offense, either.\n\n        \n            \n                The tush push didn't die in a meeting room; it died on a Sunday in Philadelphia\n                \n                    Jonathan Jones                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWinner: Jonathan Taylor's fellow big-money RBsStruggling to find green grass for much of 2025, reigning Offensive Player of the Year Barkley finally hit a home run against his old team, the New York Giants, as part of the Philadelphia Eagles' best rushing effort of the year. Meanwhile, James Cook, who just got a new deal with the Bills, exploded for 216 yards against the Carolina Panthers, and Baltimore's Derrick Henry scored twice.Loser: Everyone involved with the Bengals defenseZac Taylor runs the staff. Al Golden runs the defense. Higher-ups direct the roster. All of them must answer for the trainwreck that is Cincinnati's \"defense,\" which cost Joe Burrow a playoff run in 2024 and is about to make the team irrelevant again. Despite another valiant connection between Joe Flacco and Ja'Marr Chase, Cincy dropped to 3-5 by giving up 39 points to the New York Jets.Winner: Mike McDaniel's job securityFor another couple of weeks, at least. Tua Tagovailoa may or may not have the big-game fortitude necessary to keep the current Dolphins regime intact for the long haul. But the maligned quarterback finally found a rhythm under Mike McDaniel's direction against the Falcons to the tune of four scores and zero turnovers. Miami is still just 2-6, but this will quiet the wolves for a little bit longer.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        New York Giants rookie running back Cam Skattebo suffered a dislocated ankle in Sunday's 38-20 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, and the team announced that he is scheduled to undergo surgery Sunday night in Philadelphia but did not offer a timeline for his recovery.Skattebo was carted off the field with an air cast on his left leg with 8:07 left in the first half after he was rolled up on during a tackle. Prior to his exit, Skattebo handled three carries for 12 yards and caught an 18-yard touchdown pass. This is a devastating blow to what has been a remarkable debut season for Skattebo. The Arizona State product was a source of excitement for the Giants' future, along with fellow first-year standout Jaxson Dart, who formed the other half of a prolific backfield after winning the starting quarterback job.\"He's irreplaceable,\" Giants right tackle Jermaine Eluemunor told reporters postgame. \"You can have guys that run the ball really hard, but his energy and what he brings to the table and the way he runs the ball, it's going to be hard to replace. I just pray that he gets healthy and comes back even better next year.\"\n\n        \n            \n                NFL trade deadline rumors: Cowboys made calls for both Maxx Crosby and Trey Hendrickson, but got rejected\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSkattebo was taken to a Philadelphia-area hospital during the game and was scheduled to undergo surgery Sunday night rather than return home with the team.\"I was devastated,\" rookie quarterback and good friend Jaxson Dart said. \"That's my boy. Seeing him go down and reacting to what happened, it sucks. It's the worst part of this game.\"\nTyrone Tracy Jr. is the next man up in the backfield and figures to return to the starting role he held at the beginning of the year, so long as Skattebo is on the shelf.\nSkattebo racked up 398 yards rushing and five touchdowns, along with 189 yards receiving and a score, across the first seven games of his career. He jumped into the starting lineup three weeks into the campaign and had been one of the Giants' top weapons ever since. His three-touchdown game against the Eagles on Oct. 9 was an early high point of what looks destined to be a prolific career.Skattebo was in the running for the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year award but will undoubtedly fall out of the race now. He entered Week 8 with the seventh-best odds to win the honor, per FanDuel, at +3000.The outstanding debut campaign is part of an overall terrific year for NFL rookies. Skattebo led all rookies with 587 scrimmage yards through seven games and was one of three rookies to hit the 500-yard mark. Only one first-year player hit that threshold through seven weeks last season, in contrast.\nSkattebo looks like one of the biggest steals of the 2025 NFL Draft. He came off the board in the fourth round but outperformed every other rookie skill position player in total yardage prior to his injury. All-purpose stardom is nothing new for Skattebo, though. He made a late push last season for the Heisman Trophy at Arizona State and finished fifth in the award voting, and that came two years after he shined at Sacramento State as an FCS All-American.Eagles star running back Saquon Barkley, a former Giant, also weighed in on the injury. Barkley suffered his share of injuries during his time in New York.\"From everything I've heard, the type of person he is and how he comes to work through adversity and the mindset he has that got him to this point is going to help him get through it,\" Barkley, who tore his ACL playing for the Giants in 2020, said. \"He's a heck of a back. You could see just how the stadium felt because of the energy he brought. I know those [trainers] over there really well, and they helped me get back from my knee injury, so he's in great hands.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Leave it to NFL teams to eventually reveal the truth about themselves. The truth always comes out at some point in the season, and Week 8 certainly is justifying some theories. The Cincinnati Bengals are the prime example. Leave it to the Bengals to give the New York Jets their first win of the season, a game Cincinnati had on lock midway through the fourth quarter. The Atlanta Falcons continue to show they can't be trusted after getting blown out by the Miami Dolphins. The New York Giants are still the Giants, even with their future a lot better with Jaxson Dart. Some teams are still giving a glimmer of hope they can make the playoffs, while others are starting to see those dreams slip away. This is the beauty of the NFL every week, and the fun of overreactions. The stories sometimes write themselves.\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 8 grades: Cowboys get 'F' for blowout loss to Broncos; Jets earn 'A-' for stunning win over Bengals\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhich overreactions in the Week 8 Sunday slate are farfetched and which are reality?\nThe Eagles offense is better off without A.J. BrownOverreaction or reality: OverreactionThe Eagles have been trying to figure out their offense all season, and got going in a big way. In a blowout win over the Giants, the Eagles put up 427 yards or offense, averaged 7.5 yards per play, and scored 38 points. Jalen Hurts threw four touchdown passes and Saquon Barkley finished with 150 rushing yards. The Eagles as a team rushed for 276 yards and averaged 8.4 yards per carry. This was their best offensive performance of the season, and A.J. Brown didn't play because of a hamstring injury. Brown being unhappy with the Eagles and how he's used in the offense is another discussion (and a mystery), but is this offense really better without Brown? Of course not, even with Hurts going 15 of 20 for 179 yards and four touchdowns and Barkley averaging 10.7 yards per carry. This team needs Brown, one of the top receivers in the league, to be a part of this offense. Brown can stretch the field and keep a defense honest, opening up the run game for Barkley and giving Jalen Hurts a downfield threat. \nNo matter what Brown's issues are with Hurts and the Eagles, they need their All-Pro receiver to win another Super Bowl. Period. Dak Prescott is not a big game quarterback Overreaction or reality: RealityThe Cowboys defense is atrocious and is the biggest culprit why they are 3-4-1 through eight games. Dallas didn't have a chance to beat Denver with the way the defense played, a unit that's looking like a square peg in a round hole.You know who else didn't show up either? Dak Prescott. This was a game for Prescott to change the narrative. He was facing a top five pass defense with elite cornerbacks, in the midst of an MVP-caliber season. Heading into Sunday, Prescott ranked fourth in the league in completion percentage (71.4%), second in passing yards (1,881), second in passing touchdowns (16) and eighth in passer rating (107.6). \nHe put up a clunker against Denver, finishing 19 of 31 for 188 yards and two interceptions for a 51.5 passer rating. He went 4 of 7 for 81 yards and an interception (58.3 rating) on throws of 10+ air yards. The Cowboys didn't move the ball consistently, looking like a shell of the offense that dominated opponents all year. No matter how bad the defense is, Prescott makes $60 million a year. The weight is on his shoulders -- fair or not -- to carry this offense and keep Dallas in the game. He failed to do that and the offense laid an egg against an elite defense. This is who Prescott is in Year 10 of his career. Good quarterback, but comes up small. There's still time to change the narrative, but Sunday brought back those thoughts regarding how to define Prescott's career. \nBengals playoff hopes are dead and buriedOverreaction or reality: RealityLeave it to the Bengals to take away all their momentum after their biggest win of the season last week. Cincinnati was 3-4 and right in the thick of the AFC North race prior to facing the winless New York Jets Sunday, a golden opportunity to go 4-4. Instead, the Bengals lost to the Jets. New York was down 38-24 with nine minutes left and rallied to beat Cincinnati, 39-38, a display of what the Bengals truly are through eight games -- a team with a bad defense and their All-Pro quarterback sidelined. The Bengals are 1-3 when scoring 38+ points over the last two years and have allowed 27+ points in seven straight games. No matter how well the Bengals offense is playing with Joe Flacco (29.7 points per game, 378.7 yards per game), Cincinnati isn't a playoff team with that defense on the field. Trey Hendrickson being hurt is icing on the cake. \nThis defense hasn't been playoff caliber all year, and losing to the Jets is unacceptable if a team is going to make a run at the division. Count the Bengals out of the AFC North race. Ravens are alive and well in AFC North raceOverreaction or reality: OverreactionThe truth of the matter is, regarding the Ravens -- we really don't know. Lamar Jackson was preparing to play this week, and then he was ruled out. Baltimore played without Jackson coming out of the bye week and started Tyler Huntley, who managed the game well enough to win on Sunday against Chicago. The Ravens get the Dolphins next week, and Jackson may not be playing in that contest either. Can Huntley and this defense -- which held an opponent to 17-or-less points again -- keep the ship afloat one more week before Jackson returns? \nThe Ravens are 2-5 and need some help from the Steelers to get back in the AFC North hunt. A loss Sunday would have buried Baltimore, but the Ravens stayed alive just by winning a game. If Jackson is back next week, look out for Baltimore. If the Ravens are 3-5 when Jackson comes back (assuming it's Week 10), they'll be on notice.Injuries will keep 49ers out of NFC West title huntOverreaction or reality: OverreactionThe 49ers have been bitten by the injury bug all season, and those wounds finally showed against the Texans. San Francisco finished with just 48 rushing yards and allowed 475 total yards in Sunday's loss to Houston, a defense that clearly was affected without Nick Bosa and Fred Warner (both are out for the season). \nSan Francisco's defense had just two quarterback hits in the game, finishing with zero sacks. C.J. Stroud had his way against the 49ers pressure (or lack thereof), going 7 of 8 for 63 yards and a touchdown (139.1 passer rating). This loss was all the more surprising given how the 49ers defense has played without Bosa and Warner.Are the injuries to those two -- and others -- becoming too much to overcome? Bryce Huff was also out Sunday, and the 49ers lost Jordan Elliott, Sam Okuayinonu, and Dee Winters on defense. On offense, Brock Purdy, Ricky Pearsall, Ben Bartch, Jake Brendel, and Brandon Aiyuk are out. Purdy is expected back next week, and the same can be said for Pearsall. The 49ers are banged up, but this is a team that has weathered the storm to a 5-3 record. They aren't out of the division race yet, but Sunday was a bad loss. \nThe tush push will be banned after the seasonOverreaction or reality: RealityThe excuses for the \"Tush Push\" have been well documented and discussed. While it's embarrassing officials say they can't officiate the play, that's the reality of the situation. Officials have a very tough job already, but they miss holds, late hits, fumbles, and pass interference plays -- and all this was in the Eagles-Giants game!When the Eagles ran the tush push and the play was ruled down due to forward progress, it's understandable. Jalen Hurts was still moving and fumbled the ball in a tie game early in the second quarter. That had nothing to do with forward progress, but the officials just missing a fumble that looked abundantly clear.Again, officials miss calls constantly. This runs deeper than the tush push, but the play is a difficult one to officiate. This is why the tush push will not last past this year, because officials can't officiate the play correctly. The play is controversial because it's not anesthetically pleasing, and the league is trying to find a reason to eliminate the play.\nThey may have their example from Eagles-Giants in Week 8. Kirk Cousins will never start a game in the NFL again Overreaction or reality: OverreactionIf Joe Flacco can start a game again, so can Cousins. Both of the older quarterbacks are in different situations regarding their NFL careers, as Cousins isn't the same player coming off a ruptured Achilles suffered two years ago. Cousins got the start on Sunday for Michael Penix Jr. and struggled, going 21 of 31 for 173 yards with no touchdown, no interceptions, and an 81.8 passer rating (the Falcons only scored 10 points and had 213 yards of offense). This was more of a Zac Robinson failure than Cousins, as the Falcons had just 15 rush attempts and Bijan Robinson had only nine carries. That's malpractice to Robinson and the Falcons offensive line, as Atlanta was still in the game midway through the second quarter. Cousins isn't teh same player that can sling the ball 30+ times the game, nor should he be asked to in a spot start. Once Cousins gets out of Atlanta and makes backup quarterback money, he'll get an opportunity to start a game again due to the injuries and nature of the position. Cousins just needs to get out of Atlanta, and the Falcons can't wait until the dead money gradually decreases on that contract. The Cousins contract was a disaster, for all parties involved. Sunday was just another rough moment. Jonathan Taylor will break the single-season rushing TD recordOverreaction or reality: OverreactionWith two rushing touchdowns on Sunday, Taylor is at 12 rushing touchdowns through eight games. The Colts running back was in the conversation to challenge LaDainian Tomlinson's record of 28, but Taylor has vaulted himself into a legitimate chance to break the mark.Taylor is on pace for 26 rushing touchdowns on the season, so he'll be two short by that pace. Taylor does have nine rushing touchdowns in his last four games and 10 total, so he's on a hot streak as the Colts offense continues to dominate opponents. The Colts offense runs through Taylor and the offensive line is getting stronger by the week.There's work to be done, but the Colts offense is a well-oiled machine right now. Taylor is the cog behind the success. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Week 8 was a return to the household names in Fantasy Football with breakouts from Saquon Barkley, Jonathan Taylor and James Cook, among others. There weren't too many surprises -- but Week 8 of the Fantasy Football season did bring some new players to the forefont with breakout performances that belong on your Fantasy Football radar now. On the Fantasy side, we received more data on how each offense plans to utilize its personnel. Our expectations for backfield touches, targets in the pass game, snap shares, and overall usage are often not met, and that's when we have to pivot.In Week 8, several players jumped on the Fantasy Football radar. This could be the start of something special for some of these players, and you'll want to get well ahead of your Week 9 Fantasy Football waiver wire by putting these players on your radar. For more on every player we discuss below, you'll want to make sure to check out Jamey Eisenberg's in-depth waiver wire column on Monday afternoon.Isaiah Davis, RB, Jets Davis showed signs of promise in Week 7 and was placed closely on all our radars at Fantasy Football Today when Breece Hall was limited in practice this week. Hall ended up playing -- and having a dominant game himself -- but Davis continued his upward trajectory. What is most promising about his role moving forward is the work he got in the pass game. The Jets appear to have found a new way to move the ball and it's by using their backs as an extension of the run game. Davis totaled 44 yards receiving on five receptions. He also added 65 yards rushing on just seven carries. 109 total yards on 12 touches -- he is the Jets' second-best playmaking option for touches for as long as Garrett Wilson is sidelined. Troy Franklin, WR, BroncosFranklin racked up 82 receiving yards and a touchdown on five receptions in Week 8. He finished with seven targets and was a clear focal point of the passing game in the first half before the Broncos jumped out to a massive lead. Franklin has struggled to find consistency in Fantasy, but he continues to produce and the Broncos offense is trending up. Xavier Hutchinson, WR, TexansWith Nico Collins (concussion) sidelined for Week 8, the expectation was that Houston's rookie receivers would pick up the slack. While both Jaylin Noel and Jayden Higgins did make their splash plays, Hutchinson was a more consistent piece of the Texans' offensive game plan. Hutchinson finished with six targets and turned them into five receptions for 69 yards and a TD. Hutchinson has been a red zone favorite for C.J. Stroud and will have FLEX appeal if Collins is forced to miss another game in Week 9. \nSamaje Perine, RB, BengalsPerine has taken a bigger role in the Bengals offense of late -- and with Joe Flacco at the helm -- this is an offense you want exposure to. Perine took nine carries for 94 yards and scored a touchdown on a long run. He also added a catch to get him to the 100 yards (total) mark. Perine is a handcuff for Chase Brown but will continue to offer FLEX appeal in the deepest of leagues and in the right matchup.RJ Harvey, RB, BroncosIf Harvey was released in your leagues and he's sitting on the waiver wire -- make sure you amend that fast. Harvey finally looked like the explosive player you drafted him in the middle rounds of your Fantasy drafts to be in Week 8. He scored three touchdowns -- two on the ground and one through the air. Denver is likely to look to use Harvey's explosion as a weapon in their offense more in the second half of the 2025 season. Jayden Higgins, WR, Texans Higgins continues to prove capable of making big plays for the Texans offense in Collins' absence. While he finished with just 34 yards receiving (and a touchdown) on four receptions, he was heavily involved from a volume standpoint. Higgins led the Texans with eight total targets. If Collins misses Week 9, Higgins has FLEX appeal. \nPat Bryant, WR, BroncosLast week we featured Chimere Dike in this column as an up-and-coming third-round rookie draft pick who started to get more involved in his offense of late and cashed in with points (in Week 7). Now, in Week 8, Bryant continues his steady drumbeat of more involvement in the Broncos offense followed up with big plays in the pass game. \n            ",

The Jets were trailing by 14 points with eight minutes left to play in the fourth quarter, but they pulled off the shocker after Breece Hall threw a game-winning touchdown pass (That is not a typo, Breece Hall threw a TD pass to put the Jets ahead with 1:54 left to play). How shocking was this win? It was the Jets' second-largest fourth-quarter comeback in franchise history. They trailed by 15 points at the start of the fourth quarter, but managed to outscore the Bengals 23-8 in the final quarter to pull off the win. Hall became the first running back since 2000 to throw a go-ahead TD in the final two minutes of a game. The last time it happened also came with the Jets when Curtis Martin threw a go-ahead TD back in 2000. Hall became just the third running back in NFL history to score two rushing touchdowns AND throw a TD pass in a single quarter (Hall did all of that in the fourth quarter). This game marked the first time since 2001 that the Jets topped 500 yards. The last time it happened also came against the Bengals. It was a great win for the Jets, but an ugly loss for the Bengals. Heading into \"Sunday Night Football,\" the Jets' win is also the only game this week that's been decided by one score. (Every other game has been decided by 11 points or more.) \nWith that in mind, let's get to the Week 8 grades, starting with New York's stunning win. \n        \n            \n                The tush push didn't die in a meeting room; it died on a Sunday in Philadelphia\n                \n                    Jonathan Jones                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nN.Y.

With the score, Taylor matched Hall of Fame running back Earl Campbell for the fourth-most rushing touchdowns in history for a player in his first 75 games. Fittingly, Taylor's setting-setting score came against the Campbell's former team as the Oilers eventually were re-named shortly after the franchise moved from Houston to Tennessee. Both Taylor and Campbell ran for 63 touchdowns during their first 75 games. \nCampbell's iconic career included being named the NFL's MVP in 1979. While Taylor's current season has been MVP worthy so far, that award will likely elude him as a non-quarterback hasn't won league MVP since 2012, when former running back Adrian Peterson took home the honor after he nearly broke Eric Dickerson's single-season rushing record. \nWhile league MVP may be beyond his reach, Taylor has strengthened his case to win Offensive Player of the Year. He entered Sunday's game as the NFL's leader in rushing yards (697) and touchdown runs (10) while being a key factor in helping guide the Colts to the NFL's best record. Taylor had 149 yards and two touchdowns on just 10 carries on Sunday following his 80-yard scoring jaunt. The league's rushing champion back in 2021, Taylor is also on the precipice of reclaiming his unofficial title as the best player at his position, something Colts coach Shane Steichen feels that his player has already done. \n\"He's the best back in the league right now,\" Steichen recently said of Taylor. \"There's no doubt.\"\n            \n    ",

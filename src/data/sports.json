On Sunday, the AFC East-leading New England Patriots, led by quarterback Drake Maye, battle the NFC South-leading Tampa Bay Buccaneers and quarterback Baker Mayfield. On 'Monday Night Football,' Jalen Hurts leads the Philadelphia Eagles into Lambeau Field to face Jordan Love and the Green Bay Packers. Both Tampa Bay and Green Bay enter as 2.5-point favorites. Another matchup involving contenders sees the Los Angeles Rams (6-2) traveling to San Francisco to face the 49ers (6-3) in a key NFC West matchup. The Rams are 4.5-point favorites as Matthew Stafford looks to avenge a 26-23 overtime loss to San Francisco on Oct. 2. He has won three of his last four starts against the 49ers. The largest spread is 9.5 points, with Buffalo (vs. Miami) and Denver (vs. Las Vegas) both favored by that amount. The game with the most line movement has been Jets vs. Browns, with Cleveland moving from a 2.5-point underdog to 2.5-point favorite after New York unloaded Sauce Gardner and Quinnen Williams in separate trades on Tuesday.Before making any Week 10 NFL picks or NFL score predictions on those games or others, you need to see the NFL against the spread, over/under and money line predictions powered by the self-learning SportsLine AI.New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:Built using cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques by SportsLine's Data Science team, AI Predictions and AI Ratings are generated for each game.

After celebrating his second touchdown against the Green Bay Packers on Sunday with exactly two hip thrusts, Dowdle has been fined, he announced on social media.Upon plunging into the end zone, Dowdle re-enacted the famous \"Key & Peele\" sketch with all his teammates counting his \"two pumps.\" Unfortunately for Dowdle, the show wasn't up to date on the NFL rulebook, which prohibits any celebrations of a sexual nature.\nOn Wednesday, Dowdle posted about his fine before starting a GoFundMe. According to ESPN, it was a $14,491 fine for the Panthers running back.\n\"After much thought I've launched a GoFundMe for my fines,\" Dowdle wrote on his GoFundMe page. \"Key said I got three pumps but I guess the NFL disagrees.\"\nWhile that portion of the GoFundMe was a joke, Dowdle is actually raising money for a good cause. The Panthers' breakout star said all money donated will be directed to Children's Home Society of North Carolina. As of Wednesday night, Dowdle had raised nearly $10,000.Two days prior to the fine being handed out, Panthers coach Dave Canales was asked about Dowdle's celebration. He joked about calling up Keegan-Michael Key (who hilariously responded to the ordeal) for an explanation, but he also acknowledged Dowdle probably should've just played it safely.\"We gotta be smarter in that situation,\" Canales said. \"We gotta make sure that we understand the rules. Might have to call up Keegan-Michael Key and get some clarification on that part of it. From what I understand, it's any kind of movement that way or any kind of weapons, it's all gonna get flagged.\"\nThe Panthers host the New Orleans Saints this weekend, and we'll see whether Dowdle presses his luck with another pump or two if he finds paydirt.\n            \n    ",

Suarez's suspension was applied after Game 2 of the opening round by the MLS Disciplinary Committee following its review of footage of Miami's match against Nashville and deemed that he committed violent conduct when he kicked Nashville defender Andy Najar in the 71st minute.Defender Ian Fray was also fined for diving during the match, but this suspension of Suarez is a major blow to the Herons. After Lionel Messi, Suarez has been the next most effective attacker on the team with 14 goals and 15 assists in all competitions, but when it matters most, he'll now be unavailable, and manager Javier Mascherano will need to look to other options \"Inter Miami CF accepts and respects the decision made by the MLS Disciplinary Committee,\" Inter Miami said in a statement. \"At the same time, the club wishes to express its concern about the precedent set by re-refereeing a play that had already been judged by the match officials and VAR, and its confidence that the same standard will be applied in the future to all on-field situations, in any match and involving any team.\"\nThis is the second suspension for Suarez this season after picking up a nine-game suspension for spitting on a Seattle Sounders staff member during Leagues Cup play. That suspension included six games in Leagues Cup play and three more in MLS play. The Miami forward has an extensive history of going over the line on a soccer pitch.Suarez has received three biting bans of varying lengths during his career -- four months for biting Giorgio Chiellini in 2014, 10 games for biting Branislav Ivanovic in 2013, and seven games for biting Otman Bakkal. He was also suspended after being found guilty of using a racial slur against Manchester United defender Patrice Evra.\nIt's a blow to Miami when this tie is a critical one. Win and they're through to the next round, but with a loss, it'll be a long offseason. If it's level after 90 minutes, aggregate won't matter as things will go right to penalties, increasing the pressure on the tie.\n            \n    ",

Records show that Allen, 43, was booked into the Poinsett County Jail just after 2 p.m. on Wednesday and is facing two charges -- one count of possession of less than two grams of a Schedule 1 or 2 drug and one count of possession of less than four ounces of a Schedule 4 drug. The arrest followed a traffic stop involving a vehicle driven by William Hatton, 33, with Allen as the passenger, according to The Associated Press. A \"strong odor of marijuana\" was detected, and the vehicle was subsequently searched. Marijuana was found on Allen and a cigarette box with a \"white powdery substance,\" later identified as cocaine, was also located, according to a police report. Hatton confessed to possessing drug paraphernalia containing marijuana during the stop, per Action News 5 in Memphis. The 14-year NBA veteran began his career with the Boston Celtics in 2004 after being selected with the No. 25 overall pick. Allen played six seasons for the Celtics and won a title in 2008, but was best known for his time in Memphis. He played for the Grizzlies from 2010 to 2017 and earned six All-Defensive team selections -- three first-team honors (2012, 2013, 2015) and three second-team honors (2011, 2016, 2017). Allen finished his career playing one season for the New Orleans Pelicans.\nAllen had his No. 9 retired by the Grizzlies in March, joining longtime teammates Marc Gasol and Zach Randolph in receiving that honor. He has also dealt with off-court issues, including pleading guilty in August 2023 in a federal fraud case involving NBA health insurance.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        After breaking Wayne Gretzky's all-time record last season, Washington Capitals legend Alex Ovechkin is now the inaugural member of the NHL's 900-goal club. Ovechkin reached No. 900 with his tally in the second period against the St. Louis Blues on Wednesday night.Throughout his career, Ovechkin has scored goals in a variety of ways, and his 900th might have been one of the most unique. After a Jakob Chychrun shot bounced off the end board, Ovechkin scooped up the puck and snuck a spin-o-rama backhand past a sprawling Jordan Binnington.\nIt was another historic moment for Ovechkin, and Binnington tried to keep a piece of history all to himself. While the Capitals were mobbing Ovechkin, Binnington managed to sneak the puck into his pants, thinking no one would notice.Was Binnington going to flip it on eBay for a little extra cash? Was he going to keep it on his mantle? Maybe Binnington was simply going to chuck it in the garbage out of spite. Whatever plans Binnington had, they were spoiled when a linesman skated by and made him retrieve the puck.\nThe No. 1 overall pick in the 2004 NHL Draft, Ovechkin has been climbing the record books at a rapid pace since his rookie campaign in 2005-06. Ovechkin has hit the 40-goal mark 14 times, and he's surpassed 50 goals on nine different occasions. Ovechkin has won the Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy as the league's top goal-scorer nine times, far and away the most in NHL history.\n        \n            \n                NHL Power Rankings: Cardiac Canadiens keep producing one thriller after another as they soar into top five\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLast year, Ovechkin finally surpassed Gretzky with his 895th goal and entered the 2025-26 season with 897 under his belt. After a somewhat slow start, at least by his standards, Ovechkin has earned another distinction with goal No. 900.There are still 70 games left in the season, and Ovechkin hasn't even indicated that this will be his last, though he is playing on an expiring contract. So, exactly how many goals can Ovechkin score before his career is over?\nHow many goals can Ovechkin score in his NHL career?Ovechkin has the chance to add a lot of cushion to his all-time goals record. And there aren't any major signs of him slowing down, at least offensively. Yes, Ovechkin is 40 years old, but he is built very differently from almost every other athlete.This is a player whose favorite pregame meal is an Italian feast fit for two or three. He also takes Pepsi in his water bottle and Dr. Pepper at intermission. Let's also not forget that, at the age of 39, he broke his fibula during the season and still managed to score 44 goals en route to breaking Gretzky's record.To this point in his career, Ovechkin has never scored fewer than 32 goals in a season. Let's at least give him that in 2025-26, which doesn't seem unreasonable considering he scored 44 in 65 games last year. That would put Ovechkin at 929 goals by season's end, but what if he decides to play another season or two? After all, the Capitals are a team on the rise with a good young coach, so maybe he wants to chase another Stanley Cup.\nIf nothing else, Ovechkin could extend his career to the age of 41 or 42 on the strength of his power play prowess alone. In 18 of his 19 full seasons, Ovechkin has scored at least 13 power play goals and as many as 25. If teams were going to stop his patented one-timer from the left circle, they probably would have done that at some point over the last two decades.If Ovechkin can stay on the ice for the rest of this season, plus 2026-27, it's well within the realm of possibility that he could eclipse 950 goals. It's probably fair to say 1,000 goals is probably out of range for Ovechkin, but it would not be wise to put his chances of getting there at zero because of the longevity, durability and consistency he's shown to this point.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        In the most basic terms Erling Haaland, Manchester City captain for the second time, led his team mates in much the same fashion that he has throughout his three years and change in England. Skippers can smash heads together, they can run themselves into the ground, but really there is no better way to set an example than by doing your job to the best of your abilities.Yet again Haaland did exactly that, a thundering back stick strike to cap an elegant City move, killing off any hopes his former club Borussia Dortmund might have had of overturning the lead Phil Foden had carved out seven minutes earlier. This was the Haaland that has obliterated defenses throughout his career. He holds court at the second post, waiting for the ball to come to him and knowing that when he does he will make no mistake. That is how you end up with 18 goals in 14 club games this season. That is what might win you the Ballon d'Or.Then again, if City are going to win trophies they are going to need that scintilla more from their best player than what he has delivered over the past few years. Even on a night where Foden scored a brilliant brace, this is the most heliocentric City have been under Pep Guardiola. Depending on your view of the final Lionel Messi Barcelona sides, this might be the most star reliant any elite club has been this century.In such circumstances it becomes incumbent on Haaland to make life easier for those around him, to do more than take up a scoring position and wait for the ball to come his way. Sometimes he has to go get it and exploit that gravity of his in different fashions. It would be a joy to see more of that iteration, there are few sights as exhilarating in any sport as Haaland playing the equivalent of a basketball point forward, the sort of barnstorming run he unleashed in the 27th minute tonight. After a quickly taken free kick by Nico Gonzalez, space opened up in front of the Dortmund back three. On Haaland drove, Felix Nmecha clinging onto his left shoulder and Waldemar Anton barely able to keep up with the marauding Norseman. The rest of the defense did what is only natural in such circumstances, they collapsed towards the ball, four bodies converging on Haaland, none alone able to slow the freight train flying at them. And then with a deft touch that you might not immediately associate with him, Haaland popped the ball off to his right. An unmarked Nico O'Reilly had perhaps gone a moment too soon, or maybe the pass was a smidge misplaced. Whatever the explanation, the shot was a slightly underpowered hook but it still took a fine save from Gregor Kobel to deny Haaland his assist.\nEven so, his team mates rushed over to the City captain, garlanding him with as much adulation as he would get for the winner a few moments later. They know how effective this Haaland can be, the Haaland who, as Thierry Henry put it pre-match, \"used to play the game,\" but is now \"thinking it.\"\n\"He understands that it isn't Kevin De Bruyne or Joao Cancelo delivering the crosses to him anymore. Haaland needs to make it easier for his team mates to find him.\" As Henry noted, that means runs across goal, a little more movement and a little less waiting for the ball to come. Haaland's movement isn't just creating chances for himself but space for others. That much was apparent for City's opener. When the ball came to Foden, his skipper could just have powered up the gut in expectation of a through ball. Instead he curled his run outside the right center back in Dortmund's back three. That defender had to follow Haaland which meant the one in the middle couldn't step up to the ball. The two yards of space that created were more than enough for Foden to spot his line and roll it into the far corner.\nPerhaps some of this is ascribing greater selflessness to Haaland than might be the case. The changing of his runs might be focused on making life easier for his teammates, or it might be about a striker hell bent on goals concluding that he is going to have to do a bit more himself now that De Bruyne isn't around to put chances on a plate for him. Ultimately it doesn't really matter. Haaland has not just made himself better this season. He has begun to make his team mates better. That is an intimidating prospect for those yet to face City.\n            ",

Denver is in first place at 7-2, while Las Vegas is the only team in the division under .500 at 2-6. However, Brock Bowers used the bye week to get healthy and looked dominant for the first time all season in a 30-29 overtime loss to the Jaguars last week, and Ashton Jeanty has scored six times this season to leave at least some room for hope among the Raiders' faithful. The latest NFL odds list Jeanty as high as +120 to score, which is why he's one of the SportsLine Projection Model's top Broncos vs. Raiders anytime touchdown scorer picks.Targeting NFL player props is one way to approach NFL odds at online sports betting sites for Thursday Night Football in Week 10.

However, he has scored six touchdowns in his first eight games, and he has scored five of those touchdowns in his last five outings.

He's had three one-catch games so far this season, including last week in a win over the Texans. However, that one catch against Houston was a touchdown, and he has scored four times this year. Sutton has six career touchdowns against Las Vegas (second-most against any NFL team), and the model predicts that he scores 0.57 touchdowns on average, while the odds imply a 40% chance to score. Use the latest FanDuel promo code to find this price and get $150 in bonus bets if your first $5 wager wins.RJ Harvey, Broncos (+225, bet365)The rookie running back plays a clear second fiddle to J.K. Dobbins on the depth chart, but Sean Payton has found a clear role for the second-down pick as a change-of-pace player and has used his short-area quickness to scheme up mismatches in the red zone. Harvey has now scored five touchdowns in his last three games and is up to six total touchdowns on the season. The model predicts that he scores 0.63 touchdowns on average, which more than doubles his 30.8% implied chance to score. Get $200 in bonus bets after your first $5 wager, win or lose, with the latest bet365 bonus code.  Want more Thursday Night Football picks?You've seen the model's NFL anytime touchdown prop picks for several players in Broncos vs. Raiders.

    "body": "\n        The Jacksonville Jaguars were \"buyers\" at this year's NFL trade deadline, as they sent a pair of draft picks to the Las Vegas Raiders for wide receiver Jakobi Meyers. Multiple teams were reportedly interested in Meyers, but it was first-year Jacksonville coach Liam Coen that landed him.   Meyers has just 33 catches for 352 yards this year, but he's registered four straight 800-yard receiving seasons -- including a 1,000-yard campaign in 2024. The Jaguars hope he can bring some stability to an inconsistent passing attack using his \"superpower.\"    \"We're looking forward to seeing how his skill set fits within the system,\" Jaguars general manager James Gladstone said, via ESPN. \"I think from afar it does. You think about where we're at in terms of volume of drops, what's his superpower? It's not dropping the football, right? So you just take it from the surface level, it seems fitting.\"   \n        \n            \n                Jakobi Meyers trade grades: Jaguars bolster WR room as Raiders collect future picks\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nUsually catching the football is not a \"superpower\" for a wide receiver. But for the Jaguars, it is approaching that territory.   \nJacksonville plagued by drops   According to CBS Sports Research, the Jaguars are tied in having the most dropped passes (30) through eight games since 2000. Jacksonville has also not gotten much production from its top wideout, Brian Thomas Jr.    After a historic rookie campaign in which he caught 87 passes for 1,282 yards and 10 touchdowns, Thomas is averaging just 3.8 receptions and 52.5 receiving yards per game with only one touchdown. He had four 100-yard receiving games as a rookie, but has yet to cross that threshold in 2025.    Brian Thomas Jr. 2024 to 2025   20242025Reception percentage 65% 50% Receiving yards per game 75.4 52.5 Yards after catch per reception 6.5 3.7 Thomas is still the Jaguars' leading receiver with 420 yards on 30 receptions, but they haven't gotten much production elsewhere. No. 2 overall pick Travis Hunter, the reigning Heisman Trophy winner and Fred Biletnikoff Award winner, has just 28 catches for 298 yards and a touchdown -- and it's unclear when he'll see the field again. To put those numbers in perspective, he's averaging fewer receiving yards per game than tight ends Juwan Johnson and Harold Fannin Jr.    Overall, the Jaguars passing offense ranks No. 16 in the NFL with 215.3 passing yards per game, but if you take into account just the numbers from the receivers, it looks much worse.

Period.    Hunter was placed on injured reserve with a knee injury, Thomas did not practice on Wednesday with an ankle injury, Tim Patrick has a groin issue and Dyami Brown is working through a concussion. Parker Washington, who led Jacksonville on Sunday with 90 yards on eight catches in the overtime victory over the Raiders, has been earning Lawrence's trust, but the Jags needed to add more talent in this department. Meyers helps with that.      An important Week 10 showdown   Not many view the Jaguars' Week 10 tilt vs. the rival Houston Texans as the game of the week, but it's incredibly important when it comes to the AFC South. The 5-3 Jags defeated the 3-5 Texans earlier this year, and sweeping the season series would not only put more ground between them and Houston in the division, but also inch Jacksonville closer to the 7-2 Indianapolis Colts. The Jaguars are 1.5-point road underdogs for Sunday's matchup.This decision to add Meyers was made with contending in mind, and that begins on Sunday. Meyers himself is not going to revolutionize Jacksonville's offense, but if the veteran pass-catcher can quickly establish himself as a reliable target for Lawrence, it's something that could take this team to the next level.    \n            ",

Denver (7-2) is tied for the best record in the league and is riding a six-game win streak, which is also tied for the NFL's longest. The Broncos had a comeback victory at Houston in Week 9, defeating the Texans, 18-15, via a walk-off field goal. Meanwhile, the Raiders (2-6) suffered a defeat out of their bye on Sunday as they lost in overtime to Jacksonville, 30-29. The Raiders lead the all-time series, 73-56-2. Denver cornerback Pat Surtain II (pectoral) and receiver Marvin Mims (concussion) have been ruled out. Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from Empower Field at Mile High in Denver. The Broncos swept the season series in 2024, after the Raiders had won each of the previous eight meetings. The latest Raiders vs. Broncos odds have Denver as 8.5-point favorites.

Meanwhile, Denver hasn't lived up to being a heavy favorite this season, going just 1-3 against the spread when favored by at least a touchdown.

Three of those were caught by Brock Bowers, who had missed the three previous games. Rookie Ashton Jeanty is averaging 94.6 scrimmage yards over his last five games, with five total touchdowns over that stretch.

The Broncos' 40 sacks are the most in the league, and that puts them on pace for 76 on the season, which would break the NFL's single-season record of 72 sacks by the 1984 Chicago Bears.On offense, the Broncos are simply a different team at home, with TNF taking place in Denver. The team is averaging 31.3 points at home, compared to 20 points on the road, while the Raiders equally struggle much more when leaving Vegas.

    "body": "\n        When Estevao opened the scoring for Chelsea only 16 minutes into their Champions League match against Qarabag on Wednesday, it seemed like they'd roll to victory in Azerbaijan, but instead they found out why Qarabag are one of the surprise outfits of this UCL campaign in a 2-2 draw. After Hato conceded a penalty via a handball in the box, Qarabag were able to go into the half with a 2-1 lead, and while Alejandro Garnacho did pull a goal back to level things, the Blues couldn't find a winner in a game that was a grind from start to finish.With almost a 3,000 mile journey to Baku, Enzo Maresca had to rotate his squad to cope with the travel, but it only took eight minutes for his carefully laid plans to be destroyed when midfielder Romero Lavia left the match with an injury and was replaced by Moises Caidedo. At half, another shift was made was Tyrique George was limited to only 13 touches in the first half and had to be pulled in favor of Liam Delap, who returned from a hamstring injury.\nThe changes did work as the Blues were able to turn a loss into a draw but being outperformed by Qarabag isn't what they had in mind. The Blues held most of the possession and took 16 shots while only generating 1.08 expected goals. Meanwhile, Qarabag generated an xG of 1.65 on only nine shots. Even taking out their penalty, that efficiency shows what Chelsea are missing in their striker merry-go-round. The Blues have been forced into making changes due to suspensions and injuries, but depite their hot starts to life at Chelsea, the duo have combined for three goals and three assists in all competitions.\nWingers like Estevao and Pedro Neto have done what they can, but without Cole Palmer, the attack's struggles put too much pressure on Reece James and the defense. Qarabag essentially out-did Chelsea at their own game, turning counters into goals, and there was nothing that Robert Sanchez could do about it. Many of these issues are resolved when Palmer returns to the center of the pitch, but when the Blues have aspirations of finishing in the top four of the Premier League while also balancing Champions League, they need to perform in these moments when their stars aren't available.\nit's what the top teams do, and so far, Chelsea haven't bridged the gap from being a good team to becoming a great one. They're still on the right track to advance to the knockouts of this tournament, but while losing to Bayern Munich showed how far they have to go, this game showed where depth players need to improve to make the Blues a more consistent side.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Familiar matchups abound on the NFL Week 10 schedule as there are half a dozen divisional games you can make Week 10 NFL picks on. The highlight of that slate is Rams vs. 49ers, which has L.A. as the 4.5-point road favorite, per the latest NFL odds. The Niners won, 26-23, when the two met in early October, but the Rams had won the three prior matchups. This is one of five games with a Week 10 NFL spread that favors the road team, with the Browns flipped from road underdogs to favorites (-2.5) against the Jets after New York traded away star defenders Sauce Gardner and Quinnen Williams before the trade deadline on Tuesday.Other divisional contests include Bills vs. Dolphins (+9.5), Texans vs. Jaguars (-1) and Saints vs. Panthers (-5.5). The entire NFC West will do battle as Seahawks vs. Cardinals has Seattle favored by 6.5 points, per the Week 10 NFL lines, with both teams coming off primetime games. The non-divisional slate is highlighted by Steelers vs. Chargers (-3) on Sunday night and Eagles vs. Packers (-2.5) on Monday night. All of the updated Week 10 NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Week 10 NFL picks now. LIMITED TIME: Use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1 JOIN NOW. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your initial $5 bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

New England extended its win streak to six games on Sunday versus Atlanta, but the Pats failed to cover for the first time during the streak. Meanwhile, the Bucs covered their last time out and have the rest advantage in coming off a Week 9 bye. That advantage for Tampa -- and disadvantage for New England -- can't be overlooked as the Pats are 4-12-1 ATS over their last 17 with a rest disadvantage, which dates back to the Tom Brady era.With that ATS loss to the Falcons, New England is only 3-9-1 ATS versus NFC opponents since 2023. On the field, the Patriots have the NFL's worst redzone defense this season, and Drake Maye has been sloppy with the ball as of late. He has three fumbles (one lost) and two interceptions over his last two games, which Tampa can capitalize on as it boasts the fourth-best turnover differential (+7) in the league. With the model projecting the Bucs to win the turnover battle on Sunday, and racking up twice as many defensive sacks, Tampa prevails versus the spread well over 50% of the time. See which other teams to pick here.\nAnother one of its Week 10 NFL predictions: 49ers (+4.5, 49.5) cover versus the Rams in well over 50% of simulations. San Francisco is 8-4 versus the spread over these teams last dozen meetings, including outright winning as 8.5-point underdogs in Week 5. The Niners are coming off a double-digit road victory over the Giants, with Mac Jones under center, and it doesn't matter who is at quarterback for the team as long as Christian McCaffrey is at running back. He set an NFL record on Sunday with his 16th game with both a rushing and receiving touchdown as he leads the NFL with 1,222 yards from scrimmage.Los Angeles has only truly been tested in a road environment just once this season, and it lost at Philadelphia. The team's other true road games include facing the Ravens without Lamar Jackson, and facing the lowly Titans. While L.A. has impressive metrics on both sides of the ball, one can't overlook its subpar special teams. The Rams are last in field goal percentage, third-worst in extra point percentage and just seven teams give up more yards per punt return. With San Fran having the edge on the margins, it covers, and the model also says the Under hits over 60% of the time in an A-rated total pick. See which other teams to pick here.\nHow to make Week 10 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 10 NFL schedule and just revealed four teams that cover in 60% of simulations or more, potentially giving you a huge payday.

Samoa Joe was supposed to defend his AEW world title against former champions Swerve Strickland and \"Hangman\" Adam Page. MJF made a surprise appearance during the match contract signing, evoking his right to challenge for the world title, which he earned by winning the Casino Gauntlet match at All Out. MJF claimed that winning on Saturday would make him the 10th man to become a world champion twice before turning 30, joining an illustrious list that includes John Cena, The Rock, Brock Lesnar, Randy Orton, and Lou Thesz.Another man on that exclusive list is Kazuchika Okada. The reigning AEW unified champion is a finalist in the annual Continental Classic round-robin tournament. Okada faces reigning IWGP world heavyweight champion Konosuke Takeshita in the semifinals. The winner will face the victor of the other semifinal match, Jon Moxley vs. Kyle Fletcher, later the same evening.Below is how you can catch all the action on Saturday night.Where to watch 2025 AEW Worlds EndDate: Dec. 27, 2025Location: Now Arena -- Hoffman Estates, IllinoisTime: 8 p.m. ETWatch: HBO Max, Prime Video, PPV.com, YouTube, and Fubo\n2025 AEW Worlds End match cardAEW World Championship -- Samoa Joe (c) vs. Swerve Strickland vs. MJF vs. \"Hangman\" Adam PageContinental Championship -- TBA vs. TBA (Continental Classic finals)AEW Women's World Championship -- Kris Statlander (c) vs. Jamie HayterKazuchika Okada vs. Konosuke Takeshita (Continental Classic semifinals)AEW Women's World Tag Team Championships -- Babes of Wrath (Harley Cameron & Willow Nightingale) (c) vs. Mercedes Mone & AthenaKyle Fletcher vs. Jon Moxley (Continental Classic semifinals)  AEW World Tag Team Championships -- FTR (Dax Harwood & Cash Wheeler) vs. Bang Bang Gang (Juice Robinson & Austin Gunn) (Chicago Street Fight)Darby Allin vs. Gabe KiddDeath Riders (Claudio Castagnoli, Daniel Garcia, Wheeler Yuta & Marina Shafir) vs. The Conglomeration (Mark Briscoe, Orange Cassidy & Roderick Strong) and \"Timeless\" Toni Storm (Mixed Nuts Mayhem match)Sisters of Sin (Julia Hart & Skye Blue) vs. Hyan and Maya World**denotes pre-show match\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Florida International Panthers face the UTSA Roadrunners in the 2025 First Responder Bowl on Friday night. FIU is coming off a 56-16 win at Sam Houston  State on Nov. 29, while UTSA dropped a 27-24 decision to Army that same day. FIU (7-5), who finished tied for fourth in Conference USA at 5-3, have won four in a row. UTSA (6-6), who tied for sixth in the American Conference, have won two of three. Both sides are expected to be down multiple key players due to injuries and the transfer portal, with FIU particularly decimated in the secondary. FIU's quarterback situation is a bit unclear as well after Keyone Jenkins and Joe Pesansky both dealt with injuries late in the season. Both could play in some capacity on Friday. Kickoff from Gerald J. Ford Stadium in Dallas is at 8 p.m. ET. The Roadrunners are 7-point favorites in the latest FIU vs. UTSA odds, while the over/under for total points scored is 61.5, up four from the opening line.

But if I wait on Adebayo, then this ML probably isn't playable. Since it's the front end of a back-to-back for Miami, I tend to think the team gives him that extra day off, and he plays Saturday back at home. And the Heat are really slumping too; also 5-10 away.\" Back the Hawks at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:UTSA (-7) vs. FIU (-108)UTSA has one of the best offenses in the nation, led by a quarterback who has been surrounded by high-level football his entire life. Starting quarterback Owen McCown is the son of 16-year NFL QB Josh McCown, and although Owen McCown's throwing style certainly looks different as a lefthander, he can sling the ball like his dad. McCown threw for 2,700 yards and 27 touchdowns with seven interceptions this season. He also has a top running back behind him in Robert Henry Jr., who rushed for 1,045 yards on 6.9 yards per carry this season.

Portland is home on Friday, and the Trail Blazers are 2-2 over their last four home games. Meanwhile, the Clippers are 3-13 on the road this season, including 1-7 over their last eight away games.

It will see the Minnesota Golden Gophers (7-5) facing the New Mexico Lobos (9-3) in the programs' first-ever meeting. Minnesota is riding an eight-game bowl winning streak, which is the longest active in FBS and tied for the fourth-longest in history. New Mexico enters into the Rate Bowl 2025 on a six-game winning streak as this will be its first bowl game since 2016.Kickoff is at 4:30 p.m. ET from Chase Field in Phoenix.

The Over is a combined 8-3 for the squads in road/neutral-site games in 2025. Also, the recent history of this bowl has leaned way over the total as the last two Rate Bowls have each seen 85 combined points scored.Both squads are solid versus the run but sieves versus the pass. Each allows a completion rate of over 68%, which puts them among the worst seven teams out of the 136 FBS programs. Thus, one can expect both offenses to air it out, which leads to lots of points on the scoreboard. The model forecasts the Over to hit with plenty of points to spare as simulations call for 54 combined points. Thus, the Over hits 70% of the time.The model also says one side of the spread hits nearly 60% of the time. You can see the model's pick at SportsLine.  So who wins Minnesota vs. New Mexico, and which side of the spread hits nearly 60% of the time? Visit SportsLine now to see which side of the New Mexico vs. Minnesota spread to jump on, all from the model that has simulated this matchup 10,000 times, and find out.\n            ",

BYU is 5-0 in its last five games against an opponent from the ACC, while the Yellow Jackets are 9-2 in their last 11 games played on a Saturday. Georgia Tech is also 5-0 against the spread in its last five games when playing as the underdog, and SportsLine's model is backing the Yellow Jackets to cover the spread in 59% of simulations. According to the latest college football odds, the Yellow Jackets are 4-point underdogs, while the over/under for Georgia Tech vs. BYU is 56.5. The model is also backing Missouri (-4) to cover the spread against Virginia in the Gator Bowl, while the Over (53.5) hits 62% of the time in North Texas vs. San Diego State in the New Mexico Bowl.

SportsLine's model is projecting King will have another productive performance on Saturday, helping the Yellow Jackets cover the spread in 59% of simulations. Missouri (-4) vs. VirginiaThe Cavaliers are coming off a devastating loss to Duke in the ACC Championship Game, which would have seen them advance to the College Football Playoff with a win. Meanwhile, Missouri ended the regular season on a high note, securing a 31-17 victory on the road over the Arkansas Razorbacks. The Tigers have also won 20 consecutive games when playing as the favorite, while Virginia is just 1-4 in its past five games played in December.

    "body": "\nMaking NFL picks always carries a bit more excitement when there's something on the line, and that's the case with the Week 17 NFL schedule. No less than half a dozen matchups carry postseason implications for both teams, making them ideal ones to target with Week 17 NFL bets. Among those are Texans vs. Chargers (-1.5 at DraftKings Sportsbook) and Ravens vs. Packers (-4.5) on Saturday, then Jaguars vs. Colts (56.5), Seahawks vs. Panthers (+7) and Eagles vs. Bills (-1.5) on Sunday afternoon.Then on Sunday night, the 49ers are 3-point home favorites over the Bears, per the Week 17 NFL odds. If a rest edge matters to you, then you may want to back the Bears with Week 17 NFL predictions as Chicago's coming off a Saturday game, while San Fran is coming off a Monday game. All of the updated Week 17 NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Week 17 NFL picks now.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters Week 17 on a 52-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now, it has turned its attention to the latest Week 17 NFL odds and NFL betting lines and locked in betting picks for every NFL matchup. Head here to see every pick. Top Week 17 NFL predictionsWe can tell you one of the model's strongest Week 17 NFL picks is that the Steelers (-3, 34.5) cover versus Cleveland on Sunday at 1 p.m. ET. Pittsburgh has rolled off three straight wins -- and three straight covers -- to control its own destiny to claim the AFC North. Meanwhile, Cleveland fought valiantly in its loss to the Bills on Sunday, but the Browns are now 0-4 straight-up and 1-3 ATS over the last month. Shedeur Sanders has brought excitement to the Browns but not necessarily many winning plays as no player has more turnovers (seven) than Sanders since he became starter in Week 12. Pittsburgh capitalizes off taking the ball away as the Steelers have covered in six straight games this season when winning the turnover battle. The model has Pittsburgh prevailing versus the spread nearly 60% of the time. See which other teams to pick here, and bet the Steelers using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nAnother one of its Week 17 NFL predictions: the Bengals (-7.5, 53.5) cover against the Cardinals in a 1 p.m. ET kick on Sunday. Both teams are out of the playoff picture, but Cincinnati is in much better form overall. The Bengals have won two of their past four and have covered in four of their past five. The Cardinals, meanwhile, have dropped seven straight and are just 1-6 against the spread during that span. In addition to backing the Broncos, the model also says the Over hits nearly 60% of the time. See which other teams to pick here, and bet the Bengals to cover at DraftKings:\nHow to make Week 17 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 17 NFL schedule and just revealed seven teams that outright win nearly 70% of the time, or more, potentially giving you a huge payday. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine.So what Week 17 NFL picks can you make with confidence, and which seven picks should you lock in now?

    "body": "\n        The Pittsburgh Steelers are riding high following their Week 16 upset victory over the Detroit Lions and are the clear-cut frontrunners in the AFC North with a 9-6 record. Unfortunately for the Steelers, they will be without their best player as they try to clinch the division on Sunday against the Cleveland Browns.Pittsburgh announced Friday that star pass rusher T.J. Watt will miss the game despite returning to practice this week. Watt has been trending in the right direction after suffering a partially collapsed lung during a dry needling mishap. On Wednesday, he attended practice for the first time since undergoing surgery, though he was listed as a limited participant.The Steelers will now target a Week 18 return for Watt as they gear up for a playoff run. Just having Watt back on the practice field provided a boost to his teammates.\"It's awesome to have him out there,\" pass rusher Alex Highsmith said, via ESPN. \"Just seeing him back out in the field with us, he's getting better every single day, so I think just to have him back out there, just as a leader for our group, it's just awesome to see. Excited to see how he continues to work his way back.\"\nTwo weeks ago, Watt went to a Pittsburgh hospital after experiencing discomfort in his chest. That led to him undergoing surgery to repair a partially collapsed lung. \"TJ had successful surgery to stabilize and repair a partially collapsed lung suffered Wednesday after a dry needling treatment session at the facility,\" Watt's brother, J.J. Watt, posted on social media on Dec. 12. \"  He and his family are very appreciative of everyone's kind words and well wishes.\"Watt has 53 combined tackles, 10 tackles for loss, seven sacks, three forced fumbles and one interception in the first 13 games of the season. The 2021 NFL Defensive Player of the Year is the league leader in forced fumbles (36) and QB hits (243) since being selected with the No. 30 overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft, and has recorded the fifth-most sacks in a player's first nine seasons all-time with 115.0.\nThe Steelers can officially clinch the AFC North with a win over the Browns on Sunday or a Baltimore Ravens loss to the Green Bay Packers on Saturday. Pittsburgh is looking to extend a three-game win streak in which the team is averaging 28 points per game. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Los Angeles Lakers star guard Austin Reaves will miss at least the next four weeks after being diagnosed with a grade 2 left gastrocnemius (calf) strain, ESPN reported on Friday. Reaves exited in the first half during the Lakers' 119-96 loss to the Houston Rockets on Christmas Day and did not return.\"Austin clearly felt something,\" Lakers coach JJ Redick said postgame. \"We did our normal halftime, and then as we were walking out of the locker room, [Lakers director of player performance and health] Dr. [LeRoy] Sims told me he was out.\"Reaves finished the game by scoring 12 points on 5 of 8 shooting in 15 minutes of action. With Reaves out of the lineup for the second half against Houston, veteran Marcus Smart started in his place.\n        \n            \n                JJ Redick blasts Lakers after Christmas loss to Rockets: 'We don't care enough right now'\n                \n                    Brent Brookhouse                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nReaves, 27, is in the midst of a career year with Los Angeles. The former undrafted free agent out of Oklahoma is averaging 26.6 points, 6.3 assists and 5.2 rebounds per game. Reaves scored a career-high 51 points earlier this season against the Sacramento Kings and nearly finished with a triple-double by adding 11 rebounds and nine assists.\nDespite being the second-leading scorer on his own team -- behind league-leading scorer Luka Dončić -- Reaves has filled the void while other Lakers players have been out of the lineup. Notably, LeBron James missed the first few weeks of the season due to sciatica and didn't make his season debut until Nov. 18 against the Utah Jazz.Reaves injury comes amid the Lakers' losing streakWith the loss to the Rockets on Christmas, the Lakers dropped to 19-10. Los Angeles has lost three consecutive games by double digits (Phoenix Suns, Los Angeles Clippers and Rockets). After the latest setback to Houston, Redick went on a long rant about the way his team has playing, saying that the Lakers \"don't care enough right now.\"\"We don't care enough right now,\" Redick said. \"And that's the part that bothers you a lot. We don't care enough to do the things that are necessary. We don't care enough to be a professional.\"\nThe Lakers began the 2025-26 campaign 15-4. Since that hot start, Los Angeles is 4-6 in its last 10 games. The Lakers trailed by double digits the entire second half against Houston.\n        \n            \n                JJ Redick torched Lakers' players after Christmas loss, but the real blame lies with the GM who acquired them\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"The two words of the day were effort and execution,\" Redick said. \"And I feel like when we've done both of those things at a high level, we've been a good basketball team. When we haven't, we're a terrible basketball team. And tonight we were a terrible basketball team. And that started legitimately right away.\"The four-week timeline for Reaves would likely result in him missing a majority of January. The Lakers face the Kings on Sunday and the Pistons on Tuesday before the calendar flips to 2026.\n            ",

Love did not clear protocol to return for his team's important Week 17 home game and was officially downgraded to out on Friday. Malik Willis is expected to start in Love's absence.Love was injured when he was sacked by Chicago defensive end Austin Booker in the second quarter last week. Love sustained helmet-to-helmet contact from Booker, who was flagged for roughing the passer while Love remained on the turf for several minutes. After being evaluated, Love was ruled out for the remainder of the game and the Bears went on to stun the Packers 22-16 in overtime, grabbing control of the NFC North lead in the process.Significant injuries are piling up for Green Bay in recent weeks, with star pass rusher Micah Parsons out for the season after suffering a torn ACL. Now, Love is sidelined for at least the week as Green Bay pushes for playoff positioning in the NFC.\n\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 17 playoff picture: Packers earn berth after Vikings eliminate Lions; Broncos chasing AFC's top seed\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Packers have already clinched a spot in the playoffs thanks to the Detroit Lions' loss to the Minnesota Vikings on Thursday, and there is still some hope they can catch the Bears to win the division. A Green Bay loss or Chicago win on Saturday would shut down any hopes of a division win, however, and Green Bay will now be without key players on both the offensive and defensive side of the ball.Willis is expected to be under center for Green Bay on Saturday, though Willis was also listed as questionable on the injury report after suffering a shoulder injury at the end of regulation against the Bears. Willis has also been battling an illness this week.\nThe Ravens will also likely be starting a backup quarterback as Lamar Jackson is listed as doubtful due to a back contusion as Baltimore is playing to remain in the hunt for a spot in the playoffs. Even with a Baltimore win on Saturday, the Ravens would miss the playoffs if the Pittsburgh Steelers defeat the Cleveland Browns on Sunday. If Jackson cannot play, Tyler Huntley would start for Baltimore.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\nOfficially, the NFL playoffs do not begin until Jan. 10. But don't tell that to coach DeMeco Ryans, whose Houston Texans face the Los Angeles Chargers on Saturday at SoFi Stadium.\"Right now, this is a playoff game versus the Chargers,\" he said during his weekly Wednesday press conference. \"We know they have a lot to play for. We have a lot to play for. How else would you want it?\"There is certainly much riding on Saturday's matchup. The game features two of the hottest teams in the league. The Chargers (11-4) have won four in a row and seven of their last eight and are still in the hunt for the AFC West title as well as the No. 1 overall seed in the AFC playoffs. Meanwhile, the Texans (10-5) are on a NFL-best seven-game winning streak and can clinch a spot in the postseason with a win or tie (or a Colts loss or tie on Sunday to the Jaguars). Houston also could win its division but needs an unlikely loss by Jacksonville this week or next.\nBut according to the SportsLine Inside the Lines team and Projection Model, the loser of Saturday's game could actually come out as the winner in the long run.The winner of Saturday's game has a good shot of being the top wild card team in the AFC, if not a division champion. That team would have a wild card round matchup against the worst division champion, which figures to be either the Steelers (9-6) or Ravens (7-8). Meanwhile, the loser of Saturday's game would face, if the current standings hold, either the Patriots (12-3) or Jaguars (11-4) on the road.But the model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, has both Pittsburgh and Baltimore higher than New England and Jacksonville in its power ratings.AFC rankTeamNeutral win%1Bills63.10%2Texans61.20%3Broncos60.60%4Ravens57.80%5Steelers57.10%6Patriots56.60%7Jaguars56.10%8Chargers55.90%Los Angeles is a 1.5-point favorite over Houston in the latest odds from DraftKings.Saturday's game is a rematch of a wild card playoff game last season, which the Texans won 32-12. In that game, Houston intercepted Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert four times, which was one more interception than he had thrown all regular season.This year, the Texans feature the No. 1 scoring defense in the NFL at 16.6 points per game. They will go up against a makeshift Los Angeles offensive line that will be missing its starting tackles.\"This is where you want to be in December,\" Ryans says. \"You want to be playing meaningful games, and that is what this team has earned.\"\n            ",

The question is whether the Jets have enough firepower to make that happen.The Patriots are coming off a thrilling win over the Baltimore Ravens in which Drake Maye topped 300 passing yards for the first time in his career -- and did so with ease as he cruised to 380 yards. Stefon Diggs also broke out of a minor funk with 10 receptions and 138 yards. New England has asserted itself as a true Super Bowl contender, but after a win like that one, it has to avoid a letdown against a vastly inferior opponent.New York enters this matchup on a three-game losing streak, and the latest loss was a 29-6 drubbing at the hands of the New Orleans Saints. The sad part is that was the closest game the Jets have played over the last few weeks. With third-string quarterback Brady Cook leading the way, the offense has struggled, and the defense has been a major issue for a while now. If the Jets are going to deliver some coal to their division rival, they need to find a level they haven't reached in a couple months.Here is everything you need to know about this clash of AFC East rivals.\nWhere to watch Patriots vs. Jets liveDate: Sunday, Dec. 28 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: MetLife Stadium -- East Rutherford, New JerseyTV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Patriots -13.5, O/U 42.5 (via DraftKings)Patriots vs. Jets: Need to knowKings of the East again. The Patriots can clinch their first AFC East title since 2019 with a win and a loss by the Buffalo Bills. Even if the Bills win, the Patriots still control their fate. If New England wins its last two games, it will be division champion. Considering where this team was at this time last year, first-year coach Mike Vrabel has orchestrated quite the turnaround.Maye can't miss. There was a lot of hullabaloo about Maye's first 300-yard game last week, but what he's lack in yardage totals he's made up for in pinpoint accuracy. Maye leads the league in completion percentage at 70.9%, and he would be the youngest player in NFL history to do that in a full season if he can keep this up for two more weeks. His 8.7 yards per attempt rank second in the league and would be a franchise record. The Patriots haven't had any all-time great quarterbacks before, have they?Hall going for 1,000. If the Jets are searching for positives -- and I'm sure they are these days -- they can look at Breece Hall. Their star running back is just 46 yards away from being the team's first 1,000-yard rusher since Chris Ivory in 2015. That's the longest active drought for any team in the NFL. Hitting that benchmark might be tough for Hall this week because the Patriots are one of the best run defenses in the league, allowing an average of just 100.1 yards per game.Patriots vs. Jets prediction, pick\nI tend to like the underdog when there's a massive spread in a game featuring division opponents, but not in this case. The quarterback matchup is so lopsided in the Patriots' favor that it breaks the scale, and New England has a lot to play for. I expect the Patriots will be ready to roll in this one, and if they play at their best, they can beat this Jets team by a few scores. Pick: Patriots -13.5, Over 42.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

As we turn our attention towards the final few days of 2025, there are still some players on the waiver wire who can help fantasy managers. Here are five players to consider adding who are still available in the majority of CBS leagues.Peyton Watson, Denver Nuggets (47% rostered)Depth has become a problem for the Nuggets. Aaron Gordon (hamstring) and Christian Braun (ankle) have been dealing with long-term absences. Now, Cameron Johnson (knee) is expected to miss at least four weeks. While Johnson's overall production has been a disappointment, he has averaged 31 minutes a game. His injury leaves Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray as the Nuggets' only healthy starters from the beginning of the season.Watson started each of his last 17 games with the Nuggets being so short-handed. While his numbers don't jump off the page, he averaged 13.5 points, 5.2 rebounds, 0.8 steals, one block, and 1.6 3-pointers during that span. He also shot 53.5% from the field. Watson can do enough across the board to be worth rostering in most leagues. Brook Lopez, Los Angeles Clippers (18% rostered)The injury to Ivica Zubac (ankle) has complicated what has already been a disappointing season for the Clippers. He will be out at least three weeks, leaving increased opportunities for both Lopez and John Collins. In their first full game without Zubac, Collins played 29 minutes against the Rockets and produced 13 points, five rebounds, five assists, two steals, two blocks, and three 3-pointers.\nLopez also started versus the Rockets, posting five points, six rebounds, four assists, two blocks, and one 3-pointer over 27 minutes. Even with him playing just 15 minutes per game this season, Lopez has averaged one block and 1.3 3-pointers. While he's not likely to play over 30 minutes on a nightly basis, he could certainly play 22-25 minutes a game moving forward. That's enough to consider adding him if you need blocks and 3-pointers.Sandro Mamukelashvili, Toronto Raptors (18% rostered)It has been an injury-filled season for Jakob Poeltl, who has already missed 10 games. He is currently sidelined by a back issue and has been ruled out for Friday's game against the Wizards. When he has been on the floor, he has only averaged 25 minutes. That's his lowest mark since the 2019-20 season.Mamukelashvili has started each of the last three games that Poeltl has missed. Across five total starts this season, he has averaged 16.2 points, six rebounds, 3.4 assists, and 3.4 3-pointers. Last season, he shot 37.3% from behind the arc, and he has followed that up by shooting 41.2% from deep this season. Back injuries can be tricky, so picking up Mamukelashvili now could prove to be a wise move if Poeltl ends up being out long-term.\nTim Hardaway Jr., Denver Nuggets (17% rostered)Hardaway was a bright spot for the Nuggets in their Christmas win over the Timberwolves, scoring 19 points over 41 minutes. He shot 3-for-11 from behind the arc, marking his sixth straight game with multiple made 3-pointers. Over his last three games, he has drained 16 total triples. In his first season with the Nuggets, the veteran has shot 41.9% on his 3-point attempts.It's not a huge surprise that Hardaway is having the most efficient season of his career from behind the arc. With opposing defenses giving so much attention to Jokic and Murray, Hardaway receives a lot of quality looks. Don't look for Hardaway to provide much in terms of rebounds, assists, or defense stats, but fantasy managers specifically hunting for points and 3-pointers should consider adding him.Tyler Kolek, New York Knicks (12% rostered)Kolek had a breakout performance when the Knicks defeated the Spurs in the NBA Cup championship game. While that didn't count for fantasy, he has carried over his success since then. Over the last five games, he has posted at least 16 points and eight assists in a game three times. Over the entire five-game span, he averaged 12 points, 5.2 rebounds, 6.6 assists, and 1.6 3-pointers.\nKolek is receiving additional opportunities to contribute because Miles McBride (ankle) is out. McBride has been labeled as week-to-week, and there haven't been any positive updates regarding his status. For as long as McBride remains sidelined, Kolek can provide value in deeper formats. Just be aware that it likely won't be smooth sailing for him. In one game during his recent hot streak, he had just two points and two assists over 15 minutes against the 76ers. Like many bench players, his role could fluctuate a bit on a nightly basis.\n            ",

Last Sunday, Arizona put up a fight but it was ultimately on the wrong end of a 26-19 final score against the visiting Atlanta Falcons. The loss dropped the Cards to 2-8 in one possession games. At 5-10, the Bengals are closing out their first losing season since 2020. But while the season as a whole has been forgettable, the Bengals have gotten encouraging play recently from some of their young defensive players. Cincinnati also has Joe Burrow back under center after he missed nine games with an injury. If there's a reason for optimism it's because the Bengals have gone 4-2 this season with Burrow, who threw four touchdown passes in last week's blowout win over the Dolphins in Miami. \nWhere to watch Cardinals vs. Bengals liveDate: Sunday, Dec. 28 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation:  Paycor Stadium -- Cincinnati, Ohio  TV: FOX | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Bengals -7, O/U 52.5 (via DraftKings)Cardinals vs. Bengals: Need to know Joe Cool. After having one of the worst games of his career, Burrow had one of his better ones last week in Miami. In his fourth game back from injury, Burrow went 25 of 32 for 309 yards in addition to his four touchdown passes. Ja'Marr Chase, the only Bengals player selected to the Pro Bowl, caught nine passes for 109 yards. Running back Chase Brown had three total touchdowns while amassing 109 all-purpose yards. Big 3. Cincinnati is a vastly better team when they have Burrow, Chase and fellow wideout Tee Higgins on the field together. The Bengals are 31-17 in games when all three players are available. Conversely, they are just 13-20 when they don't. Improving defense. While they are still last in the league in points allowed, Cincinnati's defense has nonetheless improved as the season has progressed. Over the past two weeks, the team has gotten interceptions from rookie Barrett Carter and 2023 third-round Jordan Battle. Against the Ravens two weeks ago, the Bengals got two sacks apiece from rookie linebacker Demetrius Knight Jr. and 2023 first-round pick Myles Murphy. Struggling offense. While their defense has been bad for most of the year, the Cardinals' offense has been pretty consistent this season in terms of scoring over 20 points per game until the past month. Over that span, Arizona has scored 20 points just once. Last week, the Cardinals scored 19 points despite rushing for 132 yards, their highest total since Week 10. McBride continues to produce. A Pro Bowl tight end each of the last two years, Arizona's Trey McBride has quickly a standout at his position. McBride has on pace to set new single-season highs after catching 109 passes for 1,098 yards in the Cardinals' first 15 games. He also has 10 touchdown catches, which is more than he had during his first three seasons combined. Cardinals vs. Bengals prediction, pick \nThe Cardinals are better than their record, so this game should be competitive well into in the second half. That being said, the Bengals should take care of business since Burrow, Chase, and Higgins are expected to all be on the field together. Brown's recent emergence should only make things easier for Cincinnati's \"Big Three.\" Pick: Bengals, -7, Under 52.5 \n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\nHere's a trivia question for you: What NBA team in the Eastern Conference has the longest current winning streak? That would be the (cue spacey intro from the song Sirius) ... Chicago Bulls.Yes, the Bulls (14-15), who sit in 10th place in the East, are the hottest team in the conference, having won four in a row. That's the second longest winning streak in the entire league, behind only the red-hot Spurs, who have won eight straight. On Friday Chicago will look to extend that winning streak to five when it takes on the Philadelphia 76ers at the United Center. The 76ers (16-12) sit in fifth place in the conference and are coming off a 114-106 loss to the Nets on Tuesday. Tyrese Maxey, who ranks third in the NBA in scoring (31.0 points per game), was limited to just 13 points on 3-of-14 shooting in that loss. Chicago is a slight 1.5-point favorite against Philadelphia.While 76ers vs. Bulls is the marquee attraction on Friday, there are other options on a sporting landscape that includes nine NBA matchups and three college football bowl games. Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Friday, Dec. 26. All times Eastern.NBA best bets, where to watch76ers at BullsTime: 7:30 p.m. | Location: Chicago | TV: Prime Video | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: 76ers +1.5\nEven though the Bulls have been winning, the defense has been more generous than Santa over the holidays. Over the last nine games, Chicago has a defensive rating of 119.5 points per 100 possessions; only four teams have been worse. At the same time, opponents are shooting 38.2% from beyond the 3-point arc. That doesn't bode well on Friday against Maxey, who is shooting 39.1% from deep. The SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every NBA game 10,000 times, says Philadelphia has a 60.0% chance to cover and assigns a B grade to 76ers +1.5.Clippers at Trail BlazersTime: 10 p.m. | Location: Portland | TV: Prime Video | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Trail Blazers +2.5\nThe Los Angeles Clippers' last two games (wins over the Lakers and Rockets) don't mask the team's deficiencies on defense. The Clippers (8-21) are gifting 118.2 points per 100 possessions this season, which ranks 26th in the entire NBA. That could be trouble on Friday against Deni Avdija and the Blazers (12-18). Avdija is having an All-Star season, scoring a team-high 25.5 points per game while also averaging 7.1 rebounds and 6.6 assists per game. The SportsLine Projection Model says Portland has a 65.0% chance to cover and gives a B grade to Blazers +2.5.College football best bets, where to watchRate Bowl: New Mexico vs. MinnesotaTime: 4:30 p.m. | Location: Phoenix | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Minnesota -1.5 | Expert: New Mexico +2.5 (Jeff Hochman)\nThe New Mexico Lobos are in the midst of one of the best seasons in program history. In their first year under coach Jason Eck, the Lobos (9-3) were this close to reaching the Mountain West Conference Championship Game but lost a weird tiebreaker to just miss out. With a win on Friday they would earn just the second 10-win season in program history and first since 1982. Meanwhile, Hochman notes that the Golden Gophers (7-5) went 1-5 against fellow bowl teams, were outgained in four of those five games and had a -141 yards per game differential. \"Minnesota went 0-5 on the road, and with the bowl being played in Arizona, the crowd is expected to strongly favor New Mexico,\" he says. However the SportsLine Projection Model disagrees. It says that the Golden Gophers, who own the nation's longest bowl winning streak (eight), have a 57.0% chance to cover and assigns a C grade to Minnesota -1.5.First Responder Bowl: Florida International vs. UTSATime: 8 p.m. | Location: Dallas | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: UTSA -5.5\nOpt-outs will play a huge role in the outcome of this game, and as of Friday morning the complete list of players who will not be participating has not been released. UTSA coach Jeff Traylor has said his team will be \"a shell of ourselves\" because of opt-outs and injuries, estimating to be without between 10 and 20 players. Meanwhile, FIU also will be without several starters, including three members of the secondary. The key to the game may come down to Panthers running back Kejon Owens against the Roadrunners defense. Owens ranks seventh in the nation in rushing yards per game (108.2) and earned Conference USA Offensive Player of the Year honors. He will face a UTSA defense that is allowing 155.5 rushing yards per game, which ranks 77th in the nation, and will be missing at least three linemen. Despite that, the SportsLine Projection Model says the Roadrunners have a 63.0% chance to cover and gives a B grade to UTSA -5.5.Looking aheadNFL: Texans at ChargersTime: 4:30 p.m. Saturday | Location: Inglewood, Calif. | TV: NFL Network | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Texans +108 | Expert: Texans +2.5 (R.J. White)\nTwo contenders in the AFC collide in a game with playoff implications when the Los Angeles Chargers and Houston Texans square off at SoFi Stadium. The Chargers (11-4) have clinched a playoff spot and currently are the top wild card team in the AFC. Meanwhile, the Texans (10-5) have won an NFL-best seven in a row and hold the third and final wild card spot but are still in the hunt for the AFC South title. Behind a fierce pass rush, Houston leads the NFL in scoring defense (16.6 points per game) and will be facing a makeshift Los Angeles offensive line. White notes that the Texans were 1.5-point favorites on the lookahead line last week. \"This feels to me like it could be decided by 1-2 points, so I'll take the value off the lookahead for what I think is the better team overall,\" he says. The SportsLine Projection Model says that Houston wins 47.0% of the time and gives a C grade to Texans money line (+108).\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Week 17 is the championship matchup in a vast majority of Fantasy football leagues, so it's the biggest week for Fantasy lineup decisions of the year for those who have made it thus far. In 2024, the players who had starred all year also showed up in the penultimate week as Joe Burrow, Saquon Barkley, Derrick Henry and Trey McBride were among the stats leaders. This year, it's the likes of Josh Allen, Jonathan Taylor and Puka Nacua who have excelled and remain must-starts as Week 17 Fantasy football picks.As for your Fantasy football start/sit decisions, targeting players on teams with something to play for that are facing teams out of playoff contention could be the way to go. So, the likes of Jaylen Warren, Baker Mayfield, Bucky Irving and Stefon Diggs may find themselves a bit higher in the Week 17 Fantasy football projections than expected. Some NFL injuries of note to consider for Fantasy include Lamar Jackson (doubtful, back) and Jordan Love (out concussion/shoulder) on Saturday.Before setting your Week 17 Fantasy football lineups for championship matchups, be sure to check out the Week 17 Fantasy football rankings from the proven computer model at SportsLine. Bet on every NFL Week 17 game at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your $5 initial wager wins:When it comes to ranking players, SportsLine's model beat human experts in Fantasy football for the past several seasons, especially when there were big differences in ranking. Over the course of a season, that could literally be the difference between winning your league or going home empty-handed.The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, including being ahead of the curve on players like A.J. Brown, Jonathan Taylor, Derrick Henry, Christian McCaffrey, Alvin Kamara and Jahmyr Gibbs. Anybody who banked on players like those could have made a run at their league title.Now, the model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, has revealed its Fantasy football rankings for Week 17 of the 2025 NFL season. Head to SportsLine now to see them. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $250 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. Top Week 17 Fantasy football picks One surprise in Week 17: The model is fading Jags wideout Brian Thomas Jr., a Pro Bowler last year who finished third in receiving yards. Thomas, who is owned in almost all leagues being started in nearly half of them, has been a top-25 Fantasy receiver over the last three weeks, but this has been his best stretch all season as inconsistency has defined his sophomore year. He had a season-low of 18 yards last week, as both Parker Washington and Jakobi Meyers have passed Thomas in the eyes of Trevor Lawrence, as those two are averaging more receptions and yards over the last month. Thomas may not warrant a spot in Week 17 Fantasy football lineups as he sits outside the top 30 in wide receiver rankings.Another curveball: The model is high on Rams tight end Colby Parkinson, despite him being the TE22 on the season and being started in just 38% of leagues this week. Parkinson has quietly performed as the TE6 since Week 10 as he's made the most of Tyler Higbee going on injured reserve. The former has six touchdowns over his last seven games while averaging 35.9 receiving yards over this stretch. He should continue that success on Monday night versus a Falcons defense which just allowed 11 catches and 118 yards to the tight end position on Sunday, which came a week after giving up a tight end touchdown.

This pick could be the difference between winning big and going home with nothing.

BYU (11-2) only has a pair of losses to Texas Tech on its resume, including dropping the Big 12 Title Game, 34-7, in its last outing.

Add in that the last two matchups between these teams saw exactly 58 combined points scored, and the model projects another contest with plenty of points. It forecasts 61 total points on Saturday, as the Over hits in well over 50% of simulations.The model also says one side of the spread hits nearly 60% of the time. You can see the model's pick at SportsLine.  So who wins BYU vs. Georgia Tech, and which side of the spread hits nearly 60% of the time? Visit SportsLine now to see which side of the Georgia Tech vs. BYU spread to jump on, all from the advanced model that's simulated this matchup 10,000 times, and find out.\n            ",

Antetokounmpo hasn't played since Dec. 3, when he suffered a right calf strain against the Detroit Pistons, but will be back on the court in Chicago as long as he gets through pregame tests with the Bucks' medical staff. Antetokounmpo was listed as questionable on the team's Saturday afternoon injury report. Antetokounmpo has missed eight games while dealing with the injury, and the Bucks went 2-6 in that span. As a result, Antetokounmpo -- should he play Saturday as anticipated -- rejoins a team that's 12-19 and in 11th place in the Eastern Conference. That should only reignite the trade rumors that swirled around Antetokounmpo right before his injury.Earlier this month, reports surfaced that Antetokounmpo was eyeing a potential exit from Milwaukee. The two-time NBA MVP did his best to shift blame onto his representation but acknowledged that his agent ultimately works for him and not the other way around.\n\"If my agent is talking to the Bucks about it, he is his own person. He can have any conversation he wants about it,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"At the end of the day, I don't work for my agent, my agent works for me. There's going to be conversations that are going to be made between him and the Bucks and him and his other players and him and other teams and other GMs, executives around the league.\"\n        \n            \n                Everybody in Milwaukee is mishandling the Giannis Antetokounmpo trade saga\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe situation could be headed toward a messy split with both parties making their fair share of mistakes throughout this saga. For now, Antetokounmpo remains a member of the Bucks, and he will try to help as Milwaukee claw its way back into the postseason picture.\nThrough 17 games this season, Antetokounmpo has been as productive as ever. He's averaging 28.9 points, 10.1 rebounds and 6.1 assists per game. He's also shooting 63.9% from the field, which is a career high.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        It took over 1000 Premier League minutes, but Florian Wirtz could be turning the corner for Liverpool at a critical time, after scoring his first Premier League goal for the club in a 2-1 victory over Wolves on Saturday. While Wolves may be firmly at the bottom of the league table, it's a significant moment for Wirtz, who came to Liverpool with high expectations and a hefty price tag following a £100 million move from Bayer Leverkusen to be the centerpiece of Arne Slot's attack.As Liverpool struggled to fit their new additions into the attack and Wirtz went from a ball dominant player at Leverkusen to a secondary option behind Mohamed Salah, it was tough to get any sort of consistency while the entire squad struggled and tumbled down the Premier League table as a result. But as 2025 comes to a close, there's hope for Liverpool despite Salah being at the Africa Cup of Nations and an injury to Alexander Isakbeing injured at the moment. Defeating Wolves pushed Liverpool into the top four for now, and while the title may still be out of reach with the Reds trailing Arsenal by 10 points, they're also still very much alive in Champions League play. With so many new faces this season, it should come as no surprise that Liverpool have taken a step back, but with this even being the first time that Wirtz has registered attacking returns in back to back games, a corner may be being turned.Becoming a full time starter for Leverkusen at only 17, it can be easy to forget that Wirtz is now still only 22 and playing his club soccer outside of Germany for the first time in his career. He's an excellent soccer player, but those are things that take time. Even for seasoned veterans, adjusting to a new club isn't something that always happens overnight. In his slick interchanges with Liverpool attackers, he has shown flashes of why he was such a coveted player, and the first goal for a new club is the hardest one to get past. The pressure won't be completely off as there's pressure every time that Liverpool takes the pitch, but not needing to hear, \"The last time that Wirtz scored was a friendly against Yokohama F. Marinos in August,\" will go a long way.\nKnocking off Real Madrid and Inter in Champions League play, some of last season's Liverpool magic is in there somewhere. To get it back consistently, Wirtz needs to hit top form for the club, and while these performances don't guarantee that he'll get a third straight attacking return facing Leeds United on New Year's Day (following this goal and an assist against Tottenham), they do raise the likelihood that the Reds can get something out of facing Arsenal away from home on Jan. 8. Win that and hope for some dropped points elsewhere and who knows, even the title chase could be down to single digits.\"The team have seen how much he did already for us, creating chances and being so close to a goal,\" Slot said about Writz's performance. \"He will go on and score many more goals than one for us. I think Florian did much more than only score today.\"Taking more than 100 touches for Liverpool and attempting the third most passes on the team, Wirtz was the most involved that he has been, and he was also able to play off the left hand side of the pitch, which has usually been occupied by Cody Gakpo. It is something that Slot will need to take note of, as it's easier for Wirtz to get on the ball whe he's in wide positions and without Isak, this is a chance to make that work moving forward.\nLiverpool need all the attacking help that they can get to make up for their defensive shortcomings and getting the best out of Wirtz is step one to figuring that out. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        LONDON -- Injuries at the back, misfiring in attack and three points in the bag. Don't you hate it when they pad out the schedules with reruns over Christmas?Arsenal's 2-1 win over Brighton was of a sort with the three points gained against Wolves, Everton, arguably even Brentford, a fingernail shredder of a victory that ought to have been more authoritative. It is not often that a team rains down 24 shots on their opponents, has 55 penalty box touches while allowing 19 and finds themselves clinging on at the death. At least it is not often when the team is not Arsenal in December 2025.Really there is probably not a lot more to this than finishing variance. Since the start of December Arsenal have scored five actual goals (and have been gifted three own goals) from shots worth 9.63 xG. Scrub Viktor Gyokeres' penalty from the equation -- about the only way he is going to get a quality shot right now -- and the shooting looks even more wayward. A team who routinely compete for championships are highly unlikely to keep doing this though. It feels different because it's Arsenal and they've been burned by variance a lot over the past 18 months. The Raul Jimenez goals, the weird red cards, those injuries that you can't see coming. The thing is that the ball doesn't usually bounce back to give Diego Gomez an open goal off Brighton's first shot from inside the penalty area. Usually when you play as well as Arsenal did today, you win handily rather than rely on a wonder save from David Raya late on. Mikel Arteta knows that as well as anyone.\n\"The margin should have been much bigger,\" he said. \"The amount of situations, chances, open chances that we generated through the game, it should never be 2-1, but that's the Premier League. I think the first shot that they had, they scored the goal and then David [Raya] has to make another save to maintain the result.\"What I like is that we have a lot of issues, we're dealing with it in an incredible way, yesterday we lost Jurrien [Timber], today we lost [Riccardo] Calafiori in the warm-up, Declan [Rice] has to play as a full-back and you see the performance that he put in, so that's the spirit and that's how much our players want it.\"What matters more than spirit, though, is performance and the performance was there. There was a wobble around Diego Gomez's second-half goal, but in the first half Arsenal were outstanding, throttling Brighton's attack while creating a mountain of chances themselves. Martin Odegaard was back to his best, conducting drives up field and drilling home the opener with precision and power. Even as the Emirates grew antsy, the hosts attacked with more oomph than they had offered against Wolves. Gabriel Martinelli missed at close range and Bukayo Saka rolled wide on the breakaway.\nTake the xG from this game, which does not account for Georginio Rutter flicking Rice's corner past his own goalkeeper, and run it into a match simulator and you end up with a game that ends up with a two-plus goal margin of victory 61% of the time. One in five of these games end up in a proper four goal plus paddling.That result might just be in the post if Arsenal keep up these performances. \"It has to be [coming],\" said Arteta, \"because we have a lot of quality. What I like is the way we play, the way we produce, how willing the players are to take that initiative, that aggression to make things happen. \"This is a very, very difficult team to play against, and I think we've done really well for the majority of the game.\"\nRelief should come. It might take the form of an easing of an injury crisis that only intensified today. Jurrien Timber was ruled out of the matchday squad after an awkward landing in training. Riccardo Calafiori had been due to start but had to drop out of the XI with an issue he had suffered on Friday, one that Arteta described as \"very, very strange.\" Santiago Canizares strange or Willie E. Coyote? Arteta will never tell.Still, amid all the injuries and the off-color finishing, Arsenal are holding firm. If this is their wobble it will be one in which they have 12 points from a possible 15, 16 from 21 since the international break. Manchester City might have closed the gap but each time they have challenged the Gunners to restore their lead, the lead has been restored.Arteta sees a light at the end of the tunnel. \"We survived six months, so let's see, there's another five and a half to go, so hopefully things will get better. The good news as well, for example we've got Gabi, we've got Gabi earlier than expected, which is great.\"\nThe return of one of the game's outstanding center backs should only solidify the foundations and deliver improved performances. Results worthy of Arsenal's lofty standing may be round the corner.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Kyle Whittingham will be incorporating at Michigan much of what he learned from Urban Meyer's process in hopes of beating the former Ohio State coach's former program for many years to come. Welcomed this week on a five-year deal, the Wolverines' new coach is tasked with repairing a blueblood in disarray following the firing of Sherrone Moore, while also moving past years of NCAA oversight tied to program abnormalities and violations.Meyer is the only Ohio State coach to never lose to Michigan, going a perfect 7-0 during his time with the Buckeyes. He thought enough of Whittingham early in his career to recommend his promotion to head coach after departing Utah for Florida following the 2004 season.Whittingham spent two seasons as Meyer's defensive coordinator from 2003-04, assembling one of the program's best defensive units. That run culminated in an unbeaten season and a Fiesta Bowl win during his final campaign.Meyer has praised Whittingham for years, even calling him the \"best coach in college football\" during the 2023 season after Utah's 34-32 victory over USC. That win pushed the Utes to a 6-1 start despite playing without injured veteran quarterback Cam Rising.\nMeyer specifically pointed to the \"toughness\" exemplified by Whittingham's program -- a defining pillar during his 21-year reign at Utah. The second-longest tenured coach in college football entering this season, Whittingham spent 32 years with the Utes before stepping away to accept the latest challenge of his career: returning Michigan to national prominence as a Big Ten title contender.Recruiting enhancementsFor the first time in his coaching career, Whittingham will have near-limitless resources at his disposal when it comes to talent accumulation. Player development was paramount at Utah, along with evaluation and identifying immediate fits in the transfer portal.Whittingham never fielded a top-10 roster in terms of talent, according to 247Sports. Yet he produced a winning record in 10 straight seasons from 2014-23. He earned three national coach of the year awards and made 50 appearances in the College Football Playoff rankings, tied with Oregon for the seventh most.\nGiven Whittingham's sustained success -- three conference championships and eight top-25 finishes -- Meyer said earlier this month that Utah's new coach, Morgan Scalley, has big shoes to fill. Meanwhile, Michigan lands an elite coach during a challenging stretch of the calendar, just days before the transfer portal opens and a couple weeks after the early signing period.\"Morgan's got a tough job [with] everything Kyle Whittingham did there,\" Meyer said on The Triple Option. \"The transition from the Mountain West Conference to the Pac-12 to the Big 12. To stay, arguably, one of the top-five most consistent programs in all of college football over the past 20 years — it's not an easy job. What I mean by that is Utah high school football? Not many guys. Your recruiting base is California. And then you've got BYU down the street to fight.\"Attention to detailMichigan under Whittingham will closely resemble the Utah program he built over the past two decades -- defined by scrupulous attention to detail across all areas and a premium on discipline. Whittingham has long considered Meyer a mentor and maintains a friendship with his former boss from their time together with the Utes. \n\"It was kind of a weird situation. I had been at (Utah) seven or eight years, our head coach was let go and I thought I should be the guy,\" Whittingham said ahead of the 2022 Rose Bowl against Ohio State. \"Urban got the job, and it turned out to be the best thing that ever happened to me as a football coach, because after two years with him I realized I wasn't ready two years prior.\"\"His complete organization of the entire program, on a day-to-day basis -- mapping out the entire year -- nothing was left to chance,\" Whittingham said.Strength on offenseWhittingham is expected to bring Utah offensive coordinator Jason Beck with him to Ann Arbor, a move that should help Michigan retain talent after the Utes ranked fifth nationally in scoring this season at 41.1 points per game. Utah finished second in the Big 12 to champion Texas Tech across several statistical categories and ranked No. 2 nationally in rushing offense at 269.7 yards per game.\nMichigan's offense has been at its best in recent years when it imposed its will at the line of scrimmage behind physical running backs and elite offensive line play. Those elements are staples of Beck's scheme, along with a dynamic playmaker at quarterback.Following Whittingham's hiring, Michigan quarterback Bryce Underwood reposted the program's official announcement on his Instagram story, accompanied by a photo of himself with his new coach. At Utah this season, Devon Dampier threw for 2,180 yards and 22 touchdowns while adding 687 rushing yards.Freshman quarterback Byrd Ficklin averaged nine yards per carry, finishing with 503 yards and 10 touchdowns as a change-of-pace threat. Michigan will be a program to monitor closely when the transfer portal opens Jan. 2, given Whittingham's expected power-based offensive approach.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Saturday afternoon's SoFi Stadium showdown between the Houston Texans (10-5) and the Los Angeles Chargers (11-4) possesses plenty of postseason implications. The Texans can return to the playoffs for the third consecutive season through two paths: defeating the Chargers or by the Indianapolis Colts losing versus the AFC South-leading Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday. An AFC West title is still on the table for the Chargers, who can knock off the Broncos in Week 18 by winning against the Texans on Saturday before facing the Denver Broncos in their final regular-season game.   This matchup stars two of the hottest teams in the NFL with Houston winning 10 of the last 12 games and Los Angeles ripping off a string of seven victories in the last eight games. The outcome  will be determined by which offense can prevail against either the NFL's No. 1 scoring defense (the Texans, who are allowing 16.6 points per game) or the NFL's No. 8 scoring defense (the Chargers, who are allowing 20.1 points per game). Where to watch Chargers vs. TexansDate: Saturday, Dec. 27 | Time: 4:30 p.m. ETLocation: SoFi Stadium (Inglewood, California)TV: NFL Network | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Chargers -1.5, O/U 39.5 (via DraftKings Sportsbook)\nTexans vs. Chargers: Need to knowCan Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert evade the Texans' pass rush? The Texans are the NFL's best scoring defense (16.6 points per game allowed) and total defense (272.3 total yards per game allowed in 2025, and the last time they faced the Los Angeles Chargers, they threw quarterback Justin Herbert in a locker. Back in the 2024 AFC wild card round, the Texans coerced Herbert into four interceptions, and they sacked him four times in a 32-12 blowout loss. Herbert threw more interceptions than he did in the entire 2024 regular season (three).  This season with injuries to both starting tackles, Rashawn Slater and Joe Alt, the Chargers quarterback has remained under siege: Herbert is being pressured on 42.4% of his dropbacks this season, the highest rate in the NFL. That's bad news facing Pro Bowl edge rusher Danielle Hunter, whose 9.0 sacks during Houston's seven-game winning streak are the second-most in the league in that span behind only NFL sacks leader Myles Garrett's 12.0 in that stretch. Hunter's 13.0 sacks overall this season are tied with Chargers edge rusher Tuli Tuipulotu for the third-most in the league. Just behind him is teammate Will Anderson Jr.'s 11.5 sacks, tied for the seventh-most in football. \nHerbert will have his hands full against the best pass rush duo in football. How will Texans QB C.J. Stroud handle Chargers' zone defense? Much of Houston quarterback C.J. Stroud's success this season has come against man coverage: he has completed 63.6% of his passes vs. man, the third-highest rate entering Week 17, with an average yards per pass attempt of 7.4, the eighth-most in the NFL entering Week 17. Stroud has thrown the most touchdowns without an interception, 13, against man coverage this season. However, he's been significantly worse against zone coverage this season: his 66.3% completion rate against zone is the ninth-lowest in the league entering Week 17 with only three touchdowns and all six of his interceptions. The Chargers run zone on 82.9% of their defensive plays, the second-highest rate in football. Los Angeles' 17 interceptions as a team are tied for the third-most in the NFL with the Texans, and 14 of them have come in zone coverage. Chargers rookie RB Omarion Hampton could be X factorOne way to slow down an opposing pass rush is a strong running game, and the return of Hampton from an early-season ankle injury could be the difference for Herbert and the Chargers in this matchup against the Texans. Hampton has forced a missed tackle on 32.7% of his carries, the highest rate in the NFL and the only figure above 30% among running backs with at least 100 carries, per NFL Pro. Texans vs. Chargers prediction, pickChargers wide receiver Quentin Johnston rediscovered his TCU form (104 yards and a touchdown on four catches) in Week 16 in a 34-17 domination of the Dallas Cowboys.  Hampton seems to be operating at full tilt after an efficient 85 yards rushing and a touchdown on 16 carries -- 5.3 yards per carry --- last week. The Texans' defense will have to respect Hampton, which will allow Herbert to have he wasn't able to against Houston a year ago when dropping back to pass, particularly on play-action. That will lead to the Chargers exacting revenge for their postseason disappointment last year. \nPick: Chargers 24, Texans 20 | (Los Angeles -1.5, Over 39.5)\n            ",

Stroud. Houston has the league's top defense, ranking first in both points allowed and yards allowed, and it's a defense that Justin Herbert knows all too well. In the Jan. 2025 playoff game between these teams, Houston picked off Herbert four times, which is one more pick than Herbert had in the entire 2024 regular season. Speaking of turnovers, the Texans have committed an NFL-low of five giveaways during their 10-2 run over their last dozen games, and they're on pace to be the first team in 17 years to not allow 250 passing yards in a game. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Chargers can coverWhile the Texans have lost multiple games ATS during their winning streak, the same can't be said about L.A. which has covered in all four games of its four-game win streak. The Chargers have clinched a playoff spot, but they still has a huge incentive in front of them as they can get the No. 1 seed, and a bye, if they win out. Meanwhile, Los Angeles' defense has actually performed better than Houston's over the last two months as L.A. has given up a league-low of 254.5 total yards over the last eight games. The Chargers also have a big historical edge in regard to the spread, going 7-3 versus the line over their 10 all-time meetings. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Texans vs. Chargers picksSportsLine's model has simulated Chargers vs. Texans 10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 41 combined points. It also says one side of the spread is the better value. You can only get the pick at SportsLine. So who wins Texans vs. Chargers, and which side of the spread is the better value? Visit SportsLine now to see which side of the Chargers vs. Texans spread to jump on, all from the advanced model that is up well over $7,000 on its NFL picks since its inception, and find out.\n            ",

White said. \"That's shifted this line through zero from the lookahead of Houston -1.5, along with the Chargers dominating an awful Cowboys defense. I expect the Raiders game to be a wake-up for Houston, and their edge rushers should have much more success against the Chargers' battered O-line than Dallas did. This feels to me like it could be decided by 1-2 points, so I'll take the value off the lookahead for what I think is the better team overall.\" Back the Texans at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Over 38.5 in Packers vs. RavensBoth of these teams' starting quarterbacks left with injuries last week, but they have capable backups as well. Ravens backup quarterback Tyler Huntley has started 15 games over his six-year NFL career, while playing in 29 contests, and he made five starts last year with the Dolphins. He completed 9 of 10 passes for 65 yards in relief of Lamar Jackson last week, and with playmakers such as Derrick Henry, Zay Flowers and Mark Andrews in the offense, Baltimore should be able to score regardless. Jordan Love entered the concussion protocol for the Packers, and backup Malik Willis left with a shoulder injury last week. Love has been ruled out, but Willis is expected to start. These two offenses and coaches are too capable not to put up points regardless of the quarterback, which is why the model remains confident in backing the Over in its Saturday best bets. The Over hits in 58% of the model's simulations. Back the Over at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:LSU (+102) to defeat HoustonLane Kiffin will take over as LSU's head coach, but not on Saturday, and the Tigers can rally around Frank Wilson one last time as the team's interim head coach. LSU does have some players opting out, but key players are also deciding to play, including sophomore quarterback Michael Van Buren Jr., who is 2-1 as a starter since taking over the job. The Tigers nearly closed their regular season with an upset victory on the road against No. 8 Oklahoma before falling, 17-13. LSU also won last year's Texas Bowl against a Texas team, so they won't be intimidated by the environment. Houston (9-3) hasn't played an SEC team this season, as the Cougars may be at a talent disadvantage on Saturday. The model projects LSU to win in 62% of simulations, showcasing strong value at plus money. Back LSU at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:\nWant more NFL and college football picks for Saturday?You've seen some of the model's Saturday best bets.

Moreover, both coordinators (OC John David Baker and DC Josh Aldridge) have moved to other jobs. Expect to see lots of mobile QB Mike Wright, who once created a buzz at Vanderbilt, but little since, as Blake Harrell has to reconfigure his offense on the fly.  Pitt has had a few portal losses, too, but the Panthers were a revelation after frosh Mason Heintschel took over at QB, covering all six wins thereafter, with a win margin of better than 18 ppg.

Those who've made NFL picks against the spread all year are probably aware that New England and Seattle each have a league-high of 13 spread wins this season.

They split their two regular season matchups both versus the line and outright, with the Rams winning the first by two points and the Seahawks winning the second by one point.

WhiteWhite, CBS Sports' managing editor of Fantasy and gambling, is 21-15-1 (+445) on his last 37 over/under picks. For Patriots vs. Broncos, he is backing Under 42.5.\"The Patriots defense has run roughshod over a pair of offenses with major injury concerns the last two weeks, and they'll get another with Jarrett Stidham at quarterback. Playcaller Zak Kuhr is in his bag, completely outmaneuvering the Chargers and Texans, and Stidham faces an uphill battle to score points. Drake Maye's offense has struggled with turnovers against two top-tier defenses and gets another here, and the margin between the Broncos and second place in sacks was more than the gap between No. 2 and 9. Maybe another defensive score ruins this Under like it did last week in Texans-Pats, but I have to back it above the key number of 41.\" See all of White's picks here, and new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:\nTop NFL picks from Alex SelesnickA prop-bet specialist, Selesnick, who is better known as PropStarz, has returned nearly 45 units since joining SportsLine. He enters this weekend on a 61-44 roll on NFL player props that has returned nearly $1,000 for $100 players. This week, PropStarz is going Over 21.5 receiving yards for Seahawks running back Kenneth Walker III.\"Walker has cleared this line in seven of eleven games since the Seahawks Week 9 bye. This, of course, is despite an almost 50/50 route share split with Zach Charbonnet. With the latter back out for the season, I expect Walker to take on a bigger role, which should include more pass plays. It's a great matchup for him, as the Rams allowed the fifth most receiving yards to running backs in the regular season (38 yards per game), with an opposing back clearing this line in nine of their last eleven games. This includes Walker's 64-yard and 44-yard performances (Charbonnet with six total targets and 32 yards as well).

    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL Championship Round takes place on Sunday as the Broncos host the New England Patriots (-3.5, 42.5) at 3 p.m. ET and the Seahawks host the Rams (+2.5, 45.5) at 6:30 p.m. ET. While one could pursue standard NFL bets like the spread and total with a Championship Round NFL parlay, you could also take a chance on plus-money predictions. Wagers like alternate lines, exact score predictions and NFL props often have huge returns, and stringing them together within a single bet could be an NFL longshot parlay worth pursuing.The Pats have won four straight games by double digits and now get to face a backup quarterback in Jarrett Stidham who hasn't thrown a pass in two years. If you expect another huge Pats victory, then you could back New England on an alternate spread as Patriots -13.5 has +242 odds at DraftKings Sportsbook. This could be a standalone bet or as part of an NFL longshot parlay prediction. Before making any Championship Round NFL picks or parlays, you need to see the Championship Round NFL longshot parlay from SportsLine's proven computer simulation that pays out $1.1 million on a $10 bet.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters the AFC and NFC Championship Games on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now that the simulation model has had a chance to digest the Championship Round NFL odds, it's locked in its betting picks to form a longshot NFL parlay that could pay out $1.1 million for a $10 bettor. You can only see the picks and full parlay by heading to SportsLine.Top Championship Round NFL parlay picksFor the Championship Round, one of the picks featured in the parlay is taking Denver's Zach Allen to have 1+ sacks (+191) versus the Patriots. Denver's 68 sacks led the NFL in the regular season and were just four shy of matching the all-time NFL record. Allen is the only member of this elite Broncos defense to be a First-Team All-Pro as the lineman had 7.0 sacks and lived in the offensive backfield. His 47 QB hits led all NFL players, even topping Myles Garrett, who set the single-season sack record.New England has allowed five sacks in back-to-back games, and just three quarterbacks were sacked more often than Drake Maye (47) in the regular season. Allen has at least 0.5 sacks in his last two playoff games, and this season he has three times as many sacks playing at home than in road stadiums. The Broncos are projected to have 4.42 sacks on Sunday, making this an NFL prop with great value to back. See the rest of the picks in the Championship Round NFL parlay here, and you can bet Allen to record at least half a sack using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nHow to make NFL parlay picks for a payout of $1.1 millionThe parlay also includes six additional picks from the Championship Round from SportsLine's computer model, including multiple touchdown props that return higher than +400. You can only see the picks and the full parlay at SportsLine.What are the top NFL picks for the Championship Round that can be combined into a parlay that returns $1.1 million on just a $10 bet, and what optimal touchdown scorer bets should you be all over?

    "body": "\nInterest in NFL player props always increases as the importance of games increases as well, and such is the case with the penultimate week of the 2026 NFL playoffs. We've reached the NFL Championship Round with Broncos vs. Patriots (-4.5 at DraftKings Sportsbook) in the AFC title game and Rams vs. Seahawks (-2.5) in the NFC title game. Prop bets for the likes of Drake Maye, Courtland Sutton, Matthew Stafford, Kyren Williams and Sam Darnold will be among the most sought after with NFL picks, but considering overlooked players could find value with your NFL bets.Jarrett Stidham could be one of those as he starts in place of Bo Nix (ankle), and the former has an NFL props total of 0.5 interceptions (-183/+142) for Sunday. Those NFL prop odds for the Under are intriguing considering Denver may heavily lean on the run, and limiting Stidham's pass attempts would, in theory, limit his chances to throw a pick. There are several other plus-money NFL props available in the latest NFL championship round odds. Before locking in any conference championship NFL picks, you'll want to check out the top NFL player props and NFL prop predictions for the AFC and NFC championship games powered by SportsLine's Machine Learning AI.New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your $5 bet wins on props like Stidham under 0.5 interceptions:\nBuilt using cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques by SportsLine's Data Science team, AI Predictions and AI Ratings are generated for each player prop. For Championship Round NFL betting, the Machine Learning Model has evaluated the NFL player prop odds and provided prop picks for every position. You can only see the Machine Learning Model player prop predictions for the NFC and AFC Championship Games at SportsLine.Top NFL Championship Round QB, RB, WR, TE player prop picksHere's a look at some of the top Championship Round NFL prop picks from SportsLine AI: Quarterback: Sam Darnold, Seahawks: Under 1.5 passing touchdowns (-114)Darnold has gone under his passing touchdowns total in four of his last five games, including having one or fewer touchdown in each of his last three games. Darnold notoriously struggles when pressured, and the Rams have the fourth-best pressure rate in the league as they forced Darnold into a zero-touchdown, four-interception game earlier this year. SportsLine AI has Darnold having 0.7 passing TDs on average in a 4-star play. See more NFL picks here, and bet Darnold to go under 1.5 passing touchdowns at DraftKings:\nRunning back: TreVeyon Henderson, Patriots: Over 9.5 carries (+118)Denver led the NFL with 68 sacks, and the best way to neutralize a ferocious pass rush is by running the ball. Henderson has received double-digit carries in 10 of his last 12 games as he had 50 more rushing attempts than Rhamondre Stevenson in the regular season. The Broncos were just gashed for 183 yards versus Buffalo, which is the most Denver has allowed all season, as Henderson will be involved early and often. He's forecasted to have 12.9 carries in a 4-star play. See more NFL picks here, and bet Henderson to go over 9.5 carries at DraftKings:\nWide receiver: Puka Nacua, Rams, Over 92.5 receiving yards (-114)Nacua had an even 300 combined receiving yards in the pair of regular-season contests versus Seattle, including a career-high of 225 yards in the last matchup. The wideout has drawn double-digit targets in each of his last seven games, and Seattle owns the No. 3 run defense, compared to the No. 10 pass defense, so attacking the Seahawks through the air will be the preferred option. Nacua is forecasted to have 111 receiving yards in a 4.5-star play. See more NFL picks here, and bet Nacua to go over 92.5 receiving yards at DraftKings:\nTight end: AJ Barner, Seahawks, Under 29.5 receiving yards (-114)Seattle is favored on Sunday versus the Rams, and Barner has gone under his receiving yards market in seven of the last 10 games when the Seahawks are favored. He wasn't even targeted last week, despite playing more snaps than any other Seahawks RB, WR or TE, and Barner had just 14 yards the prior week. The Machine Learning Model has Barner finishing with 18.6 receiving yards in a 4.5-star play. See more NFL picks here, and bet Barner to go under 29.5 receiving yards at DraftKings:\nHow to make NFL Championship Round prop betsIn addition, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model locked in confident NFL prop picks involving stars like Matthew Stafford, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Davante Adams and more. It's also identified a tight end with a plus-money payout and has over 20 other NFL props rated 4 stars or better.

    "body": "\n        The Pittsburgh Steelers have reached an agreement to hire Mike McCarthy as their next coach, the team announced. McCarthy is set to succeed Mike Tomlin while becoming only the team's fourth head coach since Chuck Noll was hired way back in 1969.  A Pittsburgh native, the 62-year-old McCarthy took the 2025 season off after spending the previous five seasons as the Dallas Cowboys' coach. Before that, he enjoyed a 13-year run as the Green Bay Packers' coach that was highlighted by Green Bay's victory over the Steelers in Super Bowl XLV. In 18 seasons as a head coach, McCarthy has compiled a 174-112-2 regular season record and an 11-11 record in the postseason. He's coached in the playoffs 12 times, including in eight straight years from 2009-16. A former offensive coordinator, McCarthy helped develop quarterbacks Aaron Rodgers and Dak Prescott. Rodgers won a Super Bowl MVP and two league MVPs with McCarthy. In 2023, Prescott enjoyed arguably his best season as he led the NFL with 36 touchdown passes.  Speaking of Rodgers, the 42-year-old future Hall of Famer spent the 2025 season with the Steelers and played a key role in helping Pittsburgh record its record 22nd straight non-losing season. Pittsburgh would reportedly welcome Rodgers back if he decides to come back for a 22nd season. McCarthy is a departure from the Steelers' usual hiring practices as Tomlin, Bill Cowher and Noll were all young, first-time head coaches with a defensive background. And in Tomlin, McCarthy is following some pretty big footsteps. Tomlin, who stepped down a day after Pittsburgh's loss to the Houston Texans in the AFC wild card round, won a Super Bowl and coached in another during his 19-year run in Pittsburgh. He led the Steelers to the playoffs 13 times (winning the AFC North eight times) and never had a losing season.  \n\n        \n            \n                Nine years without a Steelers playoff win and the quiet cost of never losing enough in Pittsburgh\n                \n                    Ryan Wilson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Steelers are coming off a third consecutive 10-7 season and their first division title since 2020. Pittsburgh also continued its nine-year drought without a playoff win following its 30-6 loss to Houston.  Pittsburgh's roster has some notable but aging players that includes 31-year-old T.J. Watt, 31-year-old Jalen Ramsey and 36-year-old Cameron Heyward. They also have some promising young talent, led by offensive linemen Zach Frazier and Mason McCormick and defensive lineman Derrick Harmon.  Quarterback remains the Steelers' biggest question mark as the team has yet to find Ben Roethlisberger's longterm successor. Once again, quarterback will be one of the Steelers' primary focuses -- if Rodgers retires or opts to play elsewhere -- as they look to once again be in contention in 2026.  \nAfter a particularly busy NFL coaching cycle where 10 jobs opened, only four vacancies remain -- the Arizona Cardinals, Buffalo Bills, Cleveland Browns and Las Vegas Raiders.\n            ",

Walker, 25, was taken into custody at the airport's Terminal C after telling a Delta Air Lines employee that his luggage contained a locked box holding a firearm, according to a criminal complaint obtained by the New York Post. Port Authority police were alerted and searched the bag, where they found a 9mm Glock pistol and 36 rounds of ammunition secured inside the locked case.Walker was charged with two counts of second-degree criminal possession of a weapon and one count of criminal possession of a firearm. He later appeared in Queens County Criminal Court on the gun charge and was released on his own recognizance. He is scheduled to return to court on March 19.Walker's attorney, Arthur Aidala, said the incident stemmed from a misunderstanding and that the firearm was legally licensed in Wisconsin, adding that Walker was unaware he could not travel with it in New York.\"It was in a locked box and he disclosed it to the people at the airport,\" Aidala told the New York Post. \"He told a person from Delta he was traveling with a firearm. He mistakenly thought because he had a licensed firearm and it was in a locked box that he was able to travel with it. We are confident the case will be dismissed.\"Selected by the Packers in the seventh round of the 2022 NFL Draft, Walker has developed into a starting left tackle over his four pro seasons. Over the past three seasons, he has appeared in 51 games, making 48 starts. He started 16 of the team's 17 games this season -- the final year of his rookie contract -- and is about to enter free agency.\nThe Packers have not issued a public statement regarding Walker's arrest.\n            \n    ",

After initially signing with the Tigers, Ferrelli re-entered the transfer portal and committed to Ole Miss on Thursday.The NCAA's pending decision, following written validation from the Tigers, could set off a chain reaction of tampering disclosures across college football, where rampant tampering is assumed, but left mostly up to interpretation in the NIL and transfer portal era.Rules enforcement is supposed to be top priority for the NCAA.\"We have a broken system, and if there are no consequences for tampering, then we have no rules and we have no governance,\" Swinney said Friday.Swinney said he had previously warned the Rebels that he would blow the whistle on what he considered under-the-table recruiting if Golding and Ole Miss failed to back off the former California linebacker, who signed with Clemson on Jan. 7 and moved from the West Coast to South Carolina four days later.\nFerrelli was the ACC Defensive Rookie of the Year in 2025, leading all first-year players in solo tackles (87). \"The GM (Ole Miss' Austin Thomas) assured (Clemson GM) Jordan (Sorrells) that he had communicated to the agent that he wanted no part of this and that his relationship with Jordan was more important to him than Luke Ferrelli, but that 'Pete Golding just does what he does,'\" Swinney said. Swinney said he spoke with his athletic director, Graham Neff and ACC commissioner Jim Phillips and NCAA compliance about the situation with a formal complaint. He said the SEC commissioner, Greg Sankey, was also looped in. \nSwinney alleged that Golding texted Ferrelli a photo of a \"$1 million contract\" and asked about his buyout at Clemson.\"The NCAA will investigate any credible allegations of tampering and expect full cooperation from all involved as is required by NCAA rules,\" NCAA Vice President of enforcement Jon Duncan said in a statement Friday to On3. \"We will not comment further on any ongoing investigation.\"Ironically, it was Golding and Ole Miss who were concerned over tampering during the College Football Playoff with fear former Rebels coach Lane Kiffin was targeting players to join him at LSU. Numerous Ole Miss players left for LSU even after reportedly signing rev-share contracts, including pass-rusher Princewill Umanmielen; Rebels247 says Ole Miss is getting a collective $1 million in buyout money paid back because Umanmielen and offensive lineman Devin Harper reneged on their executable contracts. \nDuke sued former quarterback Darian Mensah this week in the wake of his last-minute portal request with intentions to sign with Miami. In a 44-page document filed Tuesday morning, Duke argues that Mensah broke his contractual agreement with the Blue Devils should not be allowed to enter the portal so the two sides can enter and engage in arbitration the two sides agreed within the terms of the deal to settle disputes. The NCAA placed Michigan State on three years probation and vacated 14 wins in November following violations committed by former staff members during Mel Tucker's tenure. The NCAA found that Tucker and his former staff failed to properly oversee the program, resulting in violations involving three ineligible players. Investigators determined that staff arranged impermissible recruiting inducements and benefits, covered unofficial visit expenses and engaged in improper contact with recruits.In June 2025, Wisconsin sued Miami for alleged tampering with former player Xavier Lucas, who signed with the Hurricanes during the winter transfer portal cycle last year. According to legal documents, the Badgers accused Miami of poaching Lucas away from their roster ahead of the 2025 season and reaching out to the player despite his contract situation in the Big Ten.\nThese are only three of many examples in college football's new era of no-holds-barred recruiting in the portal.Potential punishment for Ole MissAccording to NCAA bylaw 13.1.1.4, tampering is against the rules and falls under the category of reaching out to players on opposing teams.\"An athletics staff member or other representative of the institution's athletics interests shall not communicate or make contact with the student-athlete of another NCAA Division I institution, or any individual associated with the student-athlete (e.g., family member, scholastic or non-scholastic coach, advisor), directly or indirectly, without first obtaining authorization through the notification of transfer process,\" the rulebook states. \"Before making contact, directly or indirectly, with a student-athlete of an NCAA Division II or Division III institution, or an NAIA four-year collegiate institution, an athletics staff member or other representative of the institution's athletics interests shall comply with the rule of the applicable division or the NAIA rule for making contact with a student-athlete.\"If the NCAA finds the Rebels guilty of contacting Ferrelli while he was enrolled at Clemson, that would likely result in a Level II recruiting violation for Ole Miss, per NCAA rules. If it's discovered that Ferrelli was offered money to leave the Tigers for the Rebels, as Swinney says he has proof, there's a chance Ole Miss could get hit with a more severe Level I violation.Under a Level I designation relating to illegal benefits, NCAA rules determine that as a \"cash payment or other benefits provided by a coach, administrator or representative of the institution's athletics interests intended to secure, or which resulted in, enrollment of a prospective student-athlete.\"\nFurthermore, a Level I reprimand within recruiting is defined by \"third-party involvement in recruiting violations in which institutional staff members knew or should have known about the involvement.\"Ole Miss currently holds the No. 2 transfer portal class in the country, per 247Sports. That includes the arrival of former Auburn quarterback Deuce Knight, former LSU offensive tackle Carius Curne and ex-Oregon edge Blake Purchase.The only team, right now, with a better collection of talent in its portal group is LSU. \n            ",

    "body": "\nThe 2026 AFC Championship Game will welcome back some conference powers who have been away for several years as the top-seeded Denver Broncos host the New England Patriots on Sunday. These franchises rank in the top three of all-time AFC title game appearances, but this is just the second NFL playoff appearance for Denver since its 2015 Super Bowl run. The Patriots, meanwhile, have rapidly rebuilt under first-year coach and franchise legend Mike Vrabel, and they are set to return to the AFC title game for the first time since 2018. Jarrett Stidham will start at quarterback for Denver after Bo Nix broke his ankle in the divisional round. Kickoff from Empower Field at Mile High is set for 3 p.m. ET. New England is a 4.5-point road favorite in the latest Patriots vs. Broncos odds from DraftKings Sportsbook. The over/under is 43.5.

The hypothetical lookahead lines for this game had Denver listed as a small favorite, so Nix's injury certainly changed the outlook in a major way. The Patriots have handled the Chargers and Texans without too much difficulty, defeating both by double digits. The Pats have also been beating market expectations all season as they led the NFL with a 13-5-1 record against the spread, and they were 7-1 ATS on the road. Denver, meanwhile, went just 8-10 ATS this season. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Broncos can coverStidham is a competent backup who started multiple games for Sean Payton in 2023, so the drop off might not be as large as the odds shift is indicating. Denver can also lean on a stout defense that ranked second in the NFL in total defense and third in scoring defense this season. Denver's overall spread numbers aren't as strong as New England's, but the Broncos were 5-1 ATS as an underdog and 3-0 ATS as a home underdog, and now they're getting more than a field goal in one of the league's toughest places to play. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Broncos vs. Patriots picksMarshall is going Over on the total.

The model has the Celtics covering the spread 67% of the time. Back the Celtics at bet365 here:Alabama -164 vs. Tennessee\"Believe only goes up and part of the reason I want to play this is the absurdity of the Tide's Charles Bediako being ruled immediately eligible. I don't begrudge anyone for trying to make bank -- and I assure you he got a great NIL deal -- but this is utterly ridiculous,\" SportsLine expert Matt Severance said. \"Dude played college hoops last in 2023. This is the first time a player who entered an NBA draft and signed an NBA contract after playing college basketball has been given the chance to return. He's a really good player and could lead the Tide to the Final Four if stays eligible.\" Back Alabama at bet365 here:\nLooking for NBA and college basketball picks?You've seen the model's best bets for Saturday.

    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL playoffs are down to four teams as the 2026 AFC Championship Game and the 2026 NFC Championship Game are both set to unfold on Sunday. The Broncos will host the Patriots in the AFC title game at 3 p.m. ET, and Denver's quarterback sittuation looms large in this matchup. Jarrett Stidham will replace Bo Nix, who was lost for the season on an ankle injury sustained late in Denver's win over Buffalo. The latest NFL odds from DraftKings Sportsbook list the Broncos as 3.5-point home underdogs with the total at 43.5. The NFC title game showcases the NFC West as the Seattle Seahawks (-2.5, 46.5) host the Los Angeles Rams. These teams split their head-to-head matchups in the regular season straight up, against the spread and on both sides of the total, so how should you formulate your NFL best bets this time around? SportsLine's Eric Cohen has revealed his exact score prediction for each game to help you formulate spread, over/under, money-line and NFL best bets as the conference championship games approach. A SportsLine expert and CBS on-air talent, Cohen has evaluated the entire NFL playoff slate and delivers score predictions and logic for each matchup. Cohen went 180-91-1 (66%) on his NFL straight-up picks this regular season, and was a sizzling 10-3 (77%) on his straight-up NFL playoff picks last season. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now he's turned his attention to the 2026 NFC Championship game and 2026 AFC Championship Game, studied each matchup and the NFL odds in depth, and has revealed his exact NFL score predictions for each game. All NFL betting lines via DraftKings Sportsbook.New England Patriots at Denver Broncos (+3.5)\n\"With two excellent defenses and Denver starting a backup quarterback, I just can't see this one turning into a Broncos-Bills type of shootout. My top play is the Under 41.5, give or take. I would probably play it down to 38.5 as I have a hard time seeing either team score more than 24 in this one. While I would've probably leaned Denver at home with a healthy Bo Nix, it's hard to imagine Jarrett Stidham pulling a Jeff Hostetler (see the 1990 Giants) and leading his team to the Super Bowl. Whereas the NFC game will likely be exciting to watch from an offensive standpoint, expect just the opposite here. Both of these teams have skated by with relatively easy schedules this season. This time, the Nix injury benefits New England significantly. The thing is, Drake Maye doesn't have to play well for New England to win. If the Patriots can run the ball effectively like Buffalo did last week, Denver is toast. And that's exactly what will happen.\"Pick: Patriots 21, Broncos 13Los Angeles Rams at Seattle Seahawks (-2.5)\n\"Dating back to 2024, Sam Darnold has faced the Rams four times. His teams are 1-3 in those games, with the one win being a large blown lead by Los Angeles and won on a 2-point conversion (in December 2025). He's thrown six interceptions against L.A. already this season and is once again likely not to be 100% on Sunday with an oblique injury. Meanwhile, Matthew Stafford hasn't thrown an interception against Seattle this season (5 TDs, 0 INTs). Though Stafford hasn't been at his best this postseason, I can't possibly pick Darnold over him in a big game. I saw these two face off in person last January in a playoff game moved to Arizona and if it was a prize fight, they would've stopped it in the third round. While I'm not expecting Rams star wide receiver Puka Nacua to post a 225 yard, two touchdown performance against Seattle like he did in Week 16, I'm also not sure that the Seahawks have an effective answer to slow him down. In yet another playoff thriller, Los Angeles moves on to the Super Bowl for the second time in five seasons.\"Pick: Rams 27, Seahawks 23How to get more NFL conference championship picksSportsLine's model has simulated both conference championship game 10,000 times and revealed its picks.

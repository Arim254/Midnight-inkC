The 35th overall pick in last year's draft, Emmanwori started in 11 of Seattle's 14 regular season games. He tallied 81 tackles, 2.5 sacks, an interception and broke up 11 passes while helping the Seahawks boast the NFL's top-ranked scoring defense. \nEmmanwori recovered a fumble during Seattle's blowout win over the San Francisco 49ers in the divisional round and broke up three passes during the Seahawks' win over the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC Championship game. While Seattle has an experienced backup in safety Ty Okada, Emmanwori's versatility makes him a valuable commodity in Seattle's defense. \n        \n            \n                Prisco's pick for Seahawks vs. Patriots in Super Bowl 2026: Stout Seattle defense shuts down New England\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nFour other Seahawks were limited in practice on Wednesday, including quarterback Sam Darnold, who has been nursing an oblique injury he suffered in practice on Jan. 15. Darnold has been limited in each practice since injuring the oblique, and Macdonald said his quarterback is \"right on schedule.\"\n\"We've had this plan here over the last X amount of weeks, and it varies every day,\" Macdonald told the PFWA pool reporter. \"And today he had a great day, so we're right on schedule.\"\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The NCAA denied an appeal for a sixth year of eligibility filed by Ole Miss on behalf of quarterback Trinidad Chambliss, CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz and Brandon Marcello reported on Wednesday. The NCAA previously denied Chambliss' waiver request for an additional season in January. Ole Miss appealed the decision and the NCAA informed the school of its decision -- another denial -- on Wednesday.Chambliss, who after transferring from Division II Ferris State led Ole Miss to the College Football Playoff semifinals, sought a medical redshirt for the 2022 season when he played in only two games. The waiver was denied by the NCAA athletics eligibility subcommittee, a decision Ole Miss called \"indefensible.\"\"The NCAA athletics eligibility subcommittee's decision to deny Trinidad's appeal is indefensible in light of the undisputed facts,\" Ole Miss said in a statement. \"The NCAA staff and the subcommittee asserted that Trinidad was not denied the opportunity to compete during the 2022 season, despite the reality that he did not dress for a single game while suffering from severe, incapacitating medical conditions. Those conditions were fully and contemporaneously documented by his treating physician, yet this waiver request was still denied when it should have been approved at the NCAA staff level\"\n        \n            \n                A path forward emerges in Trinidad Chambliss' eligibility case\n                \n                    Chris Hummer                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nOn Jan. 16, Chambliss filed a lawsuit against the NCAA for a temporary and permanent injunction that would allow him to play another season for the Rebels. Chambliss' case will be heard on Feb. 12 at the Calhoun County Courthouse in Pittsboro, Mississippi. CBS Sports reported last month that there is optimism around the football program that Chambliss will eventually be granted an injunction, which would clear the path for him to play in 2026.\n\"Trinidad's representatives will continue to pursue all available legal remedies, and we will publicly stand behind Trinidad while holding the NCAA accountable for a decision that fails to align with its own rules, precedent, and the documented medical record,\" Ole Miss said. The legal team for Chambliss criticized the NCAA's waiver process and claimed their client was \"never going to receive fair and good faith consideration of Ole Miss' request for an additional season of eligibility from the National Collegiate Athletics Association.\" Notably, Ole Miss and Chambliss agreed on a deal last month -- contingent on the NCAA accepting his eligibility waiver for a sixth year -- that would see him return as the starting quarterback. Chambliss, who didn't begin the season as the Rebels' starting quarterback and eventually won the job from Austin Simmons, guided the program to an 11-1 regular-season record and College Football Playoff wins over Tulane and Georgia before a 31-27 loss to Miami in the semifinals.\nWith Chambliss' eligibility in limbo, the Rebels signed former blue-chip quarterback recruit Deuce Knight, an Auburn transfer. Knight would be the projected starter for Ole Miss in 2026 if Chambliss is unable to return to college. Ole Miss also signed Louisiana transfer Walker Howard. Howard had a previous stint at Ole Miss after beginning his career at LSU. \n            ",

    "description": "\n        Lefty Framber Valdez is finally off the board. The Tigers have landed the top free-agent pitcher on a three-year contract worth $115 million,",
    "body": "\n        Lefty Framber Valdez is finally off the board. The Tigers have landed the top free-agent pitcher on a three-year contract worth $115 million, reports ESPN. Valdez has an opt out after the second season and there are deferrals, reports The Athletic. The team has not yet announcing the signing.There are questions with Valdez that explain why he sat around on the market until just days before pitchers and catchers report to spring training. Still, there's a very good track record of success here.Valdez, 32, has been one of the game's top starters over the last six seasons, pitching to a 3.23 ERA since 2020 and averaging 30 starts and 192 innings per year since 2021. He is the game's preeminent ground ball starter. Since 2021, Valdez has gotten a ground ball on more than 60% of balls in play, easily the highest among starting pitchers. The league average is around 42% grounders.We ranked Valdez as the fourth-best free agent available this offseason, and the top starter available. Here's the write-up:\nValdez isn't for everyone. He's a contact manager from a  swing-and-miss generation who, year in and year out, belongs near the  bottom of the majors in average exit velocity surrendered. Of course,  that statistic doesn't tell the whole story. Valdez utilizes his  three-pitch mix (sinker, curve, change) to coerce the kind of earthbound  contact that removes the sting from the ball. Pair him with some  well-positioned and surehanded defenders and you'll be happy with the  outcome. Otherwise, why bother? Valdez rejected the qualifying offer earlier this offseason. The Tigers will have to surrender a 2026 draft pick to sign him and the Astros, Valdez's longtime team, will receive a 2026 compensation draft pick for losing him to free agency.Remember, Valdez came up in the Astros' system and debuted in 2018, pitching for current Tigers manager A.J. Hinch in the 2018-19 seasons before Hinch was dismissed in the wake of the sign-stealing scandal. In adding Valdez, the Tigers now have a pair of frontline lefties atop the rotation along with two-time AL Cy Young winner Tarik Skubal. Skubal is, of course, a free agent after the 2026 season. The presence of Valdez in the rotation post-2026 helps mitigate some of the potential loss of Skubal's services, unless the Tigers are able to come to terms on an extension with Skubal. There is also the chance the Tigers decide to trade Skubal and have Valdez take his place in the rotation, too, though that would be a substantial downgrade. As things stand, the Tigers look to have a potentially robust rotation. Skubal and Valdez are an excellent place to start. Casey Mize was an All-Star last season, going 14-6 with a 3.87 ERA in 28 starts. Jack Flaherty has shown himself to be inconsistent for years, but when he's on, he looks like a frontline starter (most recently in 2024). Reese Olson is quite capable for someone who figures to be the fifth starter and Drew Anderson is coming back to the majors after a 2.25 ERA in 30 starts in Korea in 2025. \nThe Tigers have made the playoffs and advanced for two straight seasons, losing in Game 5 of the ALDS both times. They had a 14-game lead last season and blew that, finishing one game behind the Guardians for the AL Central title. Still, they bested Cleveland in the Wild Card Series to advance.The Tigers were already arguably the favorites in the AL Central (+125, per Caesars), so adding Valdez to beef up the rotation puts them in better position to take their first division crown since 2014.\n            ",

    "description": "\n        Hockey Canada had some tough decisions to finalize its roster for the 2026 Milano-Cortina Winter Olympics but assembled a team that is the go",
    "body": "\n        Hockey Canada had some tough decisions to finalize its roster for the 2026 Milano-Cortina Winter Olympics but assembled a team that is the gold medal favorite this month in Italy.Canada started things off by announcing six players -- Connor McDavid, Nathan MacKinnon, Sidney Crosby, Brayden Point, Sam Reinhart and Cale Makar -- which left 19 spots up for grabs. Budding stars Macklin Celebrini and Connor Bedard made an impressive push for Olympic roster spots, but Celebrini got the nod and Bedard will be staying at home.Another youngster who built an impressive case was New York Islanders rookie defenseman Matthew Schaefer. The 18-year-old has been stupendous in his young NHL career, but he just missed out on joining Team Canada.The real question for Canada was what it would do in goal. Jordan Binnington, who started and won the 4 Nations Face-Off final less than a year ago, struggled early in the 2025-26 NHL season. Meanwhile, players like Logan Thompson and Darcy Kuemper played their way into Olympic consideration.\nHere is the full roster Team Canada will take to the 2026 Milano-Cortina Winter Olympics:*denotes injury replacementForwardsSam Bennett, Panthers*Macklin Celebrini, SharksSidney Crosby, PenguinsBo Horvat, IslandersNathan MacKinnon, AvalancheBrad Marchand, PanthersMitch Marner, Golden KnightsConnor McDavid, OilersBrayden Point, LightningSam Reinhart, PanthersMark Stone, Golden KnightsNick Suzuki, CanadiensTom Wilson, CapitalsDefensemenDrew Doughty, KingsThomas Harley, StarsCale Makar, AvalancheJosh Morrissey, JetsColton Parayko, BluesTravis Sanheim, FlyersShea Theodore, Golden KnightsDevon Toews, AvalancheGoaliesJordan Binnington, BluesDarcy Kuemper, KingsLogan Thompson, CapitalsBedard, Schaefer among snubsConnor Bedard and Matthew Schaefer are among the best young players in the league right now, and they're both in the midst of exceptional seasons. Bedard's shoulder injury may have had some impact on this decision by Canada, but by leaving him in North America, the Canadians will leave behind a ton of offensive upside. When it comes to Schaefer, Hockey Canada was probably always going to be hesitant about throwing an 18-year-old into the Olympic fire. Having said that, Schaefer hasn't really been playing his age as he has more than held his own against the best in the world at five-on-five, and I think he may have been a better choice over Harley or Sanheim.\nBinnington makes the cutWhile Binnington did lead Canada to gold in the 4 Nations Face-Off earlier this year, he's done everything he can to play his way off the Olympic roster in 2025-26 with uninspired play on the NHL stage. Canada must have a lot of faith he can turn it around by the time the team plane lands in Italy.That's especially the case because there were more intriguing options, like either of the Colorado Avalanche goalies. Scott Wedgewood has been a revelation this season, and Mackenzie Blackwood has quietly put together an impressive resume over the last two or three years. If the decision was based strictly off NHL performance, either one of those goalies would have gone over Binnington, but the 4 Nations Face-Off clearly made a big impact.Canada running it back on defenseThe Canadians are rolling with the same defensive group that helped them win the 4 Nations. On the one hand, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Then again, there may have been some possible upgrades out there for Team Canada.\nSanheim brings stability and reliability, but he provides little in the way of offensive upside. Harley, despite a breakout 2024-25 season, has been woefully ineffective this season. That's why I'm a little surprised that the Canadians didn't take one of Evan Bouchard or Jakob Chychrun. The former may have some defensive lapses, but he is an offensive wizard. The latter is currently building a Norris Trophy candidacy with 30 points and spectacular underlying numbers. Even the rookie Schaefer could have provided a stronger two-way game.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        An offseason of change continues for the Philadelphia Eagles, and the latest departure is perhaps as big as any non-head coach, non-coordinator movement in the NFL. Jeff Stoutland, the Eagles' offensive line coach since 2013, announced Wednesday he is leaving his post after 13 seasons. \"Philadelphia,  I've decided my time coaching with the Eagles has come to an end,\" Stoutland said. \"When I arrived here in 2013, I did not know what I was signing up for. I quickly learned what this city demands. But more importantly, what it gives back.  The past 13 years have been the great privilege of my coaching career. I didn't just work here, I became one of you. Stout out.\"In a statement, the Eagles thanked Stoutland for his \"legendary contributions to the game of football.\"\"It is hard to fathom another coach investing more personally and professionally in their players than Jeff Stoutland,\" the team said. \"Our organization is deeply grateful for Stout's contributions to our team over the last 13 seasons.\"\nStoutland, 63, was one of the bedrocks of the Eagles' organization since his arrival. After winning BCS national championships as Alabama's offensive line coach in 2011 and 2012, Stoutland joined the Eagles as part of Chip Kelly's first staff in Philadelphia. He stayed through two coaching transitions -- Kelly to Doug Pederson and Pederson to Nick Sirianni -- and was part of the Eagles' Super Bowl LII and LIX victories.\n        \n            \n                Eagles hire Sean Mannion as offensive coordinator after down year for Jalen Hurts, Philadelphia offense\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAlong the way, Stoutland was arguably the game's best position coach. Since 2012, the Eagles' 27 Pro Bowl selections from offensive linemen are most in the NFL, with Stoutland's development of late-round picks and journeymen being among the many feathers in his cap. Jason Kelce (sixth round, 2011) and Jordan Mailata (seventh round, 2018) are among his biggest successes among the former. Kelce became a seven-time Pro Bowler and six time first-team All-Pro, putting him among the greatest centers in NFL history. Mailata, a left tackle, was a second-team All-Pro in 2024. Mailata, a native of Australia, was a rugby standout who had never played American football before the Eagles drafted him. During \"Sunday Night Football\" player introductions, Mailata has said he attended \"Jeff Stoutland University\" in the spot most players say the college they attended.\nStoutland oversaw the ascension of six-time All-Pro selection Jason Peters, as well as the development and stardom of 2013 No. 4 overall pick Lane Johnson, who has six Pro Bowl selections, two first-team All-Pros and three second-team All-Pros to his name -- all under Stoutland's tutelage. Several other less-heralded linemen, such as guards Brandon Brooks, Evan Mathis and Mekhi Becton, played the best football of their careers when in Philadelphia.Sirianni has credited Stoutland for finding and coaching up the Eagles' \"Tush Push\" as well.Another change in a big offseason for EaglesOn the heels of winning Super Bowl LIX, the Eagles struggled offensively in 2025, and Sirianni removed Kevin Patullo as offensive coordinator after the team's wild card loss to the San Francisco 49ers. Stoutland held the run game coordinator role dating back to the 2018 season, but lost that title during the season, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. \nSince the end of the season, Sirianni has made wholesale changes to his offensive staff. He hired former Green Bay Packers quarterbacks coach Sean Mannion as the team's new offensive coordinator. Only a few years removed from his time as a backup quarterback, the 33-year-old Mannion will be a first-time play caller. That he'll do it without Stoutland is a major loss. Sirianni and Mannion are filling out the rest of the offensive staff and started that process with new pass game coordinator Josh Grizzard, formerly the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' offensive coordinator.The changes might not be limited to the offensive side of the ball, as defensive coordinator Vic Fangio has reportedly considered retirement. Additionally, secondary coach Christian Parker took the Dallas Cowboys defensive coordinator job.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Vinicius Oliveira wants all the smoke. Oliveira headlines UFC Fight Night on Saturday against Mario Bautista, but his ambitions are set higher in the division. He claims UFC's top bantamweights, including Umar Nurmagomedov, are running scared from him.Bantamweight is one of the most competitive divisions in the sport. Heading into his fifth UFC fight, Oliveira is already ranked at 135 pounds and main eventing a UFC card. The Brazilian, not content with his spot in the pecking order, is calling out the shark-infested top five. His prime target is fighter at No. 2.\"I can ask for Umar [Nurmagomedov] my whole life, and he'll run away,\" Oliveira told CBS Sports ahead of Saturday's main event against Mario Bautista, streaming exclusively on Paramount+. \"He'll run away from me like a demon runs away from a cross.\"Sign up for Paramount+ and watch UFC Fight Night live on Saturday night for no additional fee -- every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with the price of your subscription! Plans start as low as $8.99/month or $89.99/year!Oliveira understands why the top bantamweights might not fancy fighting him. There's little upside for highly ranked contenders to jeopardize their standing against a clearly dangerous, but somewhat unproven, contender. All of the bantamweight top stars are on Oliveira's hit list, but he's particularly fixated on Khabib Nurmagomedov's cousin.\n\"He's a smart guy. He's not crazy. He has sense. If I were Umar, I'd run away from myself, too,\" Oliveira said. \"He has many things to lose by fighting me. If he fights me, he'll lose to a guy that's ranked No. 9. He'll bring shame to his country. I think all the Nurmagomedovs will put him away like, 'You're not part of our family because you lost to 'Lok Dog.'\" Oliveira (No. 11) can close the distance between him and his targets by beating Bautista (No. 9) in Las Vegas. Another bantamweight in his purview is former champion Merab Dvalishvili. Oliveira and Dvalishvili recently crossed paths outside of the Octagon. Oliveira claims Dvalishvili confessed to not wanting to fight him during their friendly chat.\"He told me he didn't want to fight me,\" Oliveira alleged. \"He came to me and said, 'Man, I don't want to face you.' I started laughing because I want to face him. I want to prove to myself that I can put him on the ground. That my fuel is really good like his. Fans think that I don't have fuel for five rounds. I can.\"\n\n\nDvalishvili's stamina is a statistical anomaly. His endless endurance is his greatest attribute. How will Oliveira match that? With his heart, mind and hunger. It's not a promising answer, but fits Oliveira's ethos. He's a wild man: fighting with his hands down and calling out the biggest names. With a premium seemingly placed on exciting, charismatic fighters, a showcase win on Saturday could rapidly progress Oliveira towards his desired fights.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Gavin McKenna, a star forward for the Penn State hockey team who is widely considered the top prospect for the 2026 NHL Draft, is facing a felony charge following an alleged incident at a bar in State College, Pennsylvania, on Saturday night, Onward State reports. According to a court filing, McKenna is awaiting a preliminary hearing after being charged with felony aggravated assault and misdemeanor simple assault, as well as summary counts of harassment and disorderly conduct. The Felony I charge is defined as \"attempts to cause serious bodily injury or causes injury with extreme indifference.\"According to Onward State, McKenna and other members of Penn State's hockey team met at Doggie's Pub with friends and family after Saturday's game against Michigan State at Beaver Stadium before the alleged assault occurred. McKenna is accused of assaulting an individual, who reportedly suffered a broken jaw in the incident.Penn State, in a statement, said it is aware of the charges.\n\"We are aware that charges have been filed; however, as this is an ongoing legal matter, we will not have any further comment,\" the statement said.McKenna, an 18-year-old freshman from Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada, has 32 points -- 11 goals and 21 assists -- in 24 games this season for the Nittany Lions. McKenna, touted before his arrival at Penn State as a potential generational prospect, had a goal and had two assists on Saturday. An NCAA rule change allowed junior hockey players from the Ontario Hockey League, Western Hockey League and Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League to play Division I hockey. In the past, junior hockey players were considered professionals and therefore weren't allowed to play in the NCAA, but the change allowed a prospect of McKenna's caliber to go through the college recruiting process in the U.S.\nAs a 17-year-old, McKenna put together a sensational season for the Medicine Hat Tigers in the Western Hockey League in 2024-25. He posted 129 points (41 goals, 88 assists) in 56 games while also producing 38 points (nine goals, 29 assists) in 16 playoff games as Medicine Hat won the WHL Championship. McKenna, who recorded a 54-game point streak, ranked second in the WHL in points and fifth in goals while leading the league in assists.\n            ",

If you want to attend this year's game between the Seahawks and Patriots, it's going to cost you at least $4,600, which is currently the going rate for the cheapest ticket on the secondary market. If you're hoping to get a ticket at face value, you should probably just give up now, because that's not going to happen. Although $4,600 is certainly a large chunk of change, it's just a small drop in the bucket for some people. For some fans, money is no object and for those fans, I decided to go on a mission for you this week: I looked up the most expensive ticket on Stubhub and then I went to sit in the seat so you we could all get an idea of what it's like to sit in the most expensive seat at the Super Bowl. \n        \n            \n                Super Bowl sneak peek: Here's the wildest food that Seahawks and Patriots fans will eat at Levi's Stadium\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAs for Wednesday, the best seat on Stubhub is in Row 1 of section C114 behind Seattle's bench and if you want to sit there, it will cost you $30,751 per ticket. This is the most expensive ticket on Stubhub.  \n                                                                    Stubhub\n                                                            Basically, you could buy a car or you could attend the Super Bowl. You know what? Forget the car, we're going to the Super Bowl. So how close to the field are you if you buy this ticket? Let's check it out. \nHere's what a $30,000 ticket will buy you at the Super Bowl.  \n                                                                    John Breech/CBS Sports\n                                                            Now that you know where the seat is, let's check out the view. The seats in section C114 have a view on the 40-yard line, and although I couldn't get get directly to that seat, I found my way to Row 1 of section C116, which is in a similar spot, but on the opposite 40-yard line. And here it is, here's your $30,000 view: \nWhen I posted the tweet, I estimated how much a front row ticket would cost in this section and I was $10,000 off, so please never ask me to appraise your house. It will not work out well for anyone involved. There are currently two tickets on sale on the secondary market for more than $25,000 each and the other one is in Row 2 of Section 114. \nIt's a huge asking price, but for fans who want to be part of history at any cost, it can certainly be worth it. The Seahawks are in the Super Bowl for the first time in 11 years and when you've waited a decade to get back to the big game, it can be easier to justify this kind of purchase. For the Patriots, yes, they do have six Super Bowl titles, but it's been seven years since their last trip to the big game. And let's not forget, there are a lot of rich people in Silicon Valley, so it's certainly possible that someone ends up forking over $30,000 for these tickets, and if they do, you'll know exactly what view they have at the game. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- The Super Bowl isn't just about football, it's also about food and I found that out first-hand on Wednesday during a trip to Levi's Stadium where the culinary team at Levy Restaurants unveiled all the food that will be served on Super Bowl Sunday. When you spend thousands of dollars on a Super Bowl ticket, there's definitely an expectation that you'll be able to buy something better than a burger at the game and that will certainly be the case this week when Patriots and Seahawks fans arrive at Super Bowl LX. For this year's big game, Levy Restaurants was in charge of creating a menu that would give fans a true taste of the Bay Area and all I have to say is, mission accomplished. As someone who once lived in San Francisco for four years, I've tasted almost everything the city has to offer and all of that will be available at the game. \n        \n            \n                Super Bowl 2026: How to watch Patriots vs. Seahawks with TV channel, live stream and kickoff time\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhen you're playing a Super Bowl just 1.5 miles away from the San Francisco Bay, you have to have seafood and this game will have plenty of that. For one, fans will be able to buy OYSTERS at the game. There will be shuckers set up throughout the stadium with Hog Island Oysters that are straight from Tomales Bay in Marin County. \nThere will be oyster plates set up throughout the stadium. \n                                                                    CBS Sports/Tyler Sullivan\n                                                            Of course, not everyone likes oysters and if you're not an oyster person, don't worry. There are plenty of other seafood options like the Dungeness crab potatchos. With the the stadium located so close to a major body of water, the plan is for the crab to be caught just two days before the game. What's the difference between potatchos and nachos? Glad you asked. Instead of using tortilla chips, the Dungeness crab potatchos will use Kennebec potato chips and those will be covered in Petaluma white cheddar fondue sauce, sea salt and chives. If you're not a potatcho person, don't worry, there will also be some regular nachos: The Silicon Valley Grande Nachos.  \nEveryone loves nachos.  \n                                                                    John Breech/CBS Sports\n                                                            These tasty nachos feature pork chorizo, beef brisket, queso bravo and guacamole. OK, let's leave Silicon Valley and head to another part of the Bay. Chinatown is a popular spot in San Francisco and the culinary team at Levi's Stadium did their best to honor the tastes from that part of town with multiple dishes. Not only will there be Dim Sum on the menu, but there will also be a Chinatown Dawg, which will feature a Char-grilled footlong all-beef hot dog topped with Chinese hot mustard, char siu pork, sriracha, and shredded yellow daikon. One of the most famous side dishes in San Francisco is the city's garlic fries, and yes, those will also be available at the big game. If you need to pair your fries with something you could go with the NorCal Steakhouse Burger, which is an American wagyu patty, seared and topped with Applewood smoked bacon, bone marrow aioli, Point Reyes Toma and spicy house brined pickles on a locally-made brioche bun. \nFrom left to right: The Chinatown Dawg, the NorCal Steak burger and the garlic fries. Yum.  \n                                                                    CBS Sports/John Breech\n                                                            Alright, now let's get to the main event, which is actually a double main event. The Super Bowl will be serving something called the The LX Hammer Burger, which is the largest burger I have ever seen in my life. When I say this thing is bigger than my head, I'm not exaggerating. And also, I have a big head. Here's what this monster burger looks like (And if you scroll through on Instagram here, you can check out 10 other food items): This might be the biggest burger ever served at a Super Bowl.  \n                                                                    John Breech/CBS Sports\n                                                            I posted this burger on Instagram and I'm guessing that won't be the last time it's posted on Instagram because anyone who buys one on Sunday will probably be sharing their experience with it on social media. The burger weighs more than a small baby. If you can finish this burger on your own, you should win tickets to next year's Super Bowl. \nThe other main event is the Chef-carved Sonoma Mountain Beef-Chetta. This will only be available to a very small portion of the stadium, but if you can get your hands on it, it features local grass-fed organic beef from Marin County that's sliced and served with confit garlic. It's also covered in a cabernet demi-glace and horseradish crème with pull-part rolls.Only people in the owner's club will have access to this piece of meat.  \n                                                                    John Breech/CBS Sports\n                                                            Of course, after you eat, you'll need something to wash down your food and definitely won't be an issue at Levi's Stadium. Here's a quick look at several of the alcoholic options that will be featured along with the description of the drink from Levy Restaurants: Karl the Fog misty spritz: A spritzy tribute to the Bay's famous fog. Tanqueray Gin mixed with elderflower liqueur, club soda and fresh lemon juice. Chinatown's fortune cookie martini: Smirnoff vanilla vodka, amaretto, Bailey's Irish Cream and cold brew, shaken and topped with a custom chocolate-dipped fortune cookie from Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory. Halftime show Margarita: Don Julio Reposado with chili watermelon margarita mix and a Tajin rim. Kickoff tequila sunrise: Astral Blanco mixed with fresh orange juice and cherry juice, garnished with orange and maraschino cherry. Available in the East Field Club, Bud Light Club and 400 East Club. Pier 39 paloma: Casamigos Reposado shaken with fresh lime juice, agave syrup and ruby red grapefruit juice. Available at Tequileria Bars and bars near Gates A and C. Golden Gate mule: Crown Royal Whiskey, ginger beer and lime juice mixed with passion fruit liqueur. I did take a video of each drink, but I did not get to sample them, which was probably for the best. \nIf Sam Darnold throws an interception, Seahawks fans can drown their sorrows in one of these tasty drinks. If he throws two, they can have two drinks. If he throws three, then I'd suggest just buying one of each. There will also be an alcoholic milkshake available and I did get taste that and I will be making these at home on a regular basis from now on. Meet the Fog City frozen Irish coffee.  \n                                                                    John Breech/CBS Sports\n                                                            And of course, let's not forget about dessert. There will be a San Francisco sticky bun for sale. This might be the most delicious sticky bun ever made.  It doesn't \"look\" like anything special, but my goodness, it might be the tastiest thing I've ever put in my mouth. \nThe man in charge of the culinary team at Levi's Stadium is Lou Bastian, who serves as the senior vice president of culinary at Levy. This is the fourth time Bastian has been in charge of the food for a Super Bowl, so he's pretty experienced at this point and that shows. The food at the Super Bowl isn't cheap, but nothing is at the big game, so anyone who will be at Levi's Stadium on Sunday, be sure to bring some extra money so you can sample all the tasty food that's being offered. If you need me, I'll be making a fortune cookie martini in my hotel room.  \n            ",

Hayes will serve his suspension on Feb. 5 when the Lakers host the Philadelphia 76ers.Hayes played 14 minutes in that game in Washington and scored 10 points and logged three rebounds after the pregame incident at Capital One Arena. The key reserve will return to action Feb. 7 when the Lakers continue their home stand with a matchup against the Golden State Warriors.\nWith Hayes sidelined, the Lakers will be without one half of an already weak rim-protecting unit. Hayes and Deandre Ayton man the interior of a defense that allows the second-highest shooting percentage to opponents inside the restricted area.What Hayes lacks in defensive prowess, though, he often makes up for on the other end of the floor as a gifted dunker. He accepted an invitation to the NBA Slam Dunk Contest along with Detroit Pistons center Jalen Duren and San Antonio Spurs rookie Carter Bryant and on Jan. 26 proved himself worthy of that All-Star weekend appearance with an in-game between-the-legs dunk on a fastbreak.\nHayes, a Texas product and the No. 8 overall pick in the 2019 NBA Draft, averages 6.4 points and 3.8 rebounds per game on 77.5% shooting from the field. He came off the bench in all but four of the Lakers' first 41 games of the season after spending more than half of last year in a starting role in the wake of the trade for Luka Dončić. The former New Orleans Pelican joined the Lakers in 2023 and last offseason re-signed with Los Angeles on a one-year contract.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Los Angeles Kings have acquired star winger Artemi Panarin from the New York Rangers in a blockbuster deal, the team announced on Wednesday. The trade speculation around Panarin picked up when the Rangers made him a healthy scratch for trade-related reasons ahead of their Jan. 28 game against the New York Islanders, and the Russian playmaker is now on the move.In exchange for Panarin, the Kings are sending forward prospect and former first-round pick Liam Greentree, plus a conditional third-round pick back to the Rangers. New York will also retain 50% of Panarin's $11.6 million salary as part of the deal. Immediately following the deal, the Kings announced that Panarin had signed a two-year contract extension worth $11 per season. That deal will kick in next year and run through the 2027-28 campaign.Even at 34 years old, Panarin remains one of the NHL's premier wingers. He led the Rangers in both assists (38) and points (57), and he's put up some eye-popping numbers throughout his career. Since entering the league in 2015-16, Panarin ranks fourth in assists (606) and fifth in points (927). Just two seasons ago, Panarin finished fifth in Hart Trophy voting when he tallied 120 points and led the Rangers to the Presidents' Trophy.\n        \n            \n                NHL Power Rankings: Penguins' Sidney Crosby among key players to watch at 2026 Olympics\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nPanarin was in the final year of his contract with the Rangers, which carried a cap hit of just over $11.6 million. That was a major reason the Rangers chose to part ways with Panarin, who would have commanded significant money on his next deal and likely wants another crack at a Stanley Cup. New York, meanwhile, just announced it is entering a \"retool\" phase as it plays out the stretch in a disappointing 2025-26 campaign.\nNow in his 11th NHL season, Panarin began his career after signing a two-year contract with the Chicago Blackhawks straight out of the KHL. In his rookie season, Panarin tallied 30 goals en route to winning the Calder Trophy. He recorded another 30-goal season in Chicago the following season before getting traded to the Columbus Blue Jackets in the summer of 2017.Panarin played just two seasons in Columbus, but he still holds the franchise records for single-season assists (59) and points (87). He was an integral part of the 2018-19 Blue Jackets team that stunned the Presidents' Trophy winner Tampa Bay Lightning with a first-round sweep.Just months after that series, Panarin signed a massive seven-year deal with the Rangers, and he lived up to that contract with 205 goals and 402 assists in 482 games.\nNow let's look at how the Kings and Rangers each made out with this deal, which will surely reverberate throughout the NHL.The tradeKings receive: F Artemi Panarin (50% retained)Rangers receive: Conditional third-round pick, F Liam GreentreeThe gradesLos Angeles KingsIf anyone has followed along with the NHL Power Rankings, they know how much I loathe watching the Kings offense operate. Only four teams score at a lower rate than Los Angeles, and there was a serious need for more firepower at the top of the lineup. Corey Perry, at the spry age of 40, was fourth on the team in goals with 11. That was just two behind Alex Laferriere for third.An elite defensive team, the Kings needed a player of Panarin's caliber if they were going to compete for a Stanley Cup, and now they've got him. Panarin can do a little bit of everything at a high level, from distributing the puck to trigger men on his line to scoring goals himself. Just look at what he's done in the previous two seasons.\nFrom 2023-25, Panarin ranked sixth in goals (86) and eighth in assists (128). Even in a \"down\" year -- both for himself and the Rangers -- Panarin is on an 82-game pace of 29 goals and 59 assists. The Kings, meanwhile, haven't had a player top 80 points since Anze Kopitar totaled 92 in 2017-18. Panarin should also provide an excellent boost to the 29th-ranked Los Angeles power play. Since Panarin entered the league in 2015-16, only five players have put up more points than him (265) on the man advantage.What Kings coach Jim Hiller cannot do in this situation is try to hammer a square peg into a round hole. While Panarin is a much better defender than he gets credit for, Hiller can't eliminate the winger's offensive creativity for the sake of making him play a rigid defensive structure. If anything, Hiller should put Panarin on a line with Quinton Byfield and Adrian Kempe and give them the freedom to take some risks. Byfield can be the retriever, Panarin the facilitator and Kempe the shooter.When it comes to acquisition cost, this was a slam dunk for the Kings. Not only is Panarin a great fit worth a king's ransom, but L.A. didn't even have to mortgage the future, and the team still got him at 50% of his salary. Because of Panarin's no-movement clause, the Kings received an elite forward for a conditional third-round pick and a very good -- though maybe not elite -- prospect. The two-year extension at an AAV of $11 million is also a very easy pill to swallow because it's hard to see Panarin falling off a cliff between now and the end of that deal. This was great work by general manager Ken Holland. Grade: A+\nNew York RangersLook, Rangers general manager Chris Drury was in a tough spot here. Panarin had full control of his destination, and that made it nearly impossible for the Rangers to recoup anything resembling fair value. To be clear, that's not any knock on Panarin. His play prior to the summer of 2019 warranted a big deal with trade protection, and Panarin more than held up his end of the bargain throughout his seven seasons in New York. That's just the risk teams run when they hand out a clause like that.Greentree is easily the most interesting part of this return. The No. 26 overall pick in the 2024 NHL Draft, Greentree is a massive winger who's shown some high-end offensive ability at the junior level. Last season, he ranked third in the OHL with 119 points in 64 games before posting 24 points in 11 playoff games. Greentree has come back to Earth a bit in 2025-26 with 45 points in 34 games, but he was still ranked as the Kings' top prospect by The Athletic.The conditional third-round pick is pretty underwhelming -- even if it can become a second-round pick should the Kings win a playoff round. Even with Panarin holding all the leverage, the Rangers couldn't squeeze a guaranteed first- or second-round pick out of the Kings? It's practically unheard of for a player like Panarin not to command a first-round pick in return, even in these specific circumstances.\nPanarin was New York's best chance to really kickstart a rebuild, but now the team will need to swing a few more deals to really restock the cupboard. They have the players to do that, but it's disappointing the Rangers' biggest superstar couldn't garner a haul on his own. Drury avoids flunking because it's obvious Panarin held firm to his trade protection. Grade: D+\n            ",

On Sunday, Feb. 8, the AFC champion New England Patriots will do battle with the NFC champion Seattle Seahawks for the right to raise the Lombardi Trophy.New England advanced to the Super Bowl for the first time since the 2018 season thanks to consecutive victories over the Los Angeles Chargers, Houston Texans and Denver Broncos. The Patriots won a sloppy, snowy AFC title game over a Broncos team starting its backup quarterback, emerging with a 10-7 win thanks to several Denver miscues, some well-timed runs from Drake Maye and an electric performance from a defense that has stepped up in a big way during this playoff run.Seattle is headed back to the Super Bowl for the first time since making it in back-to-back years in 2013 and 2014. The Seahawks earned a first-round bye and then defeated the division rival San Francisco 49ers and Los Angeles Rams in consecutive weeks. They won a thrilling, back-and-forth NFC title game on the strength of a fantastic performance from Sam Darnold, who slayed some demons by throwing for 346 yards and three touchdowns in the 31-27 victory.Which of these two teams will emerge victorious and hoist the Lombardi Trophy? We'll find out soon enough.

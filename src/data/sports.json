    "body": "\n        UFC's new era brings new possibilities. The mixed martial arts promotion has laid out the groundwork for its first quarter, but many important questions remain unanswered.Speculation is running rampant about the future of UFC heavyweight champion Tom Aspinall, who requires multiple eye surgeries before he can return. Then there's the UFC women's bantamweight division, which is primed for a historic year as Amanda Nunes returns to challenging Kayla Harrison at UFC 324. With UFC exclusively streaming on Paramount+ for years to come, pay-per-views are a thing of the past, allowing for new matchmaking philosophies to emerge. Last year, CBS Sports' expert panel nearly swept their bold predictions. They correctly predicted Islam Makhachev conquering welterweight and former Bellator champions migrating to the UFC. If Jon Jones hadn't vacated the heavyweight title instead of fighting Tom Aspinall, it would've been a perfect run. While the sport can feel predictable at times, 2025 served as a stark reminder of just how unpredictable it really is. With that in mind, our crew at CBS Sports took a shot at picking some bold predictions for the new year below.\nGet ready for the beginning of the UFC era on Paramount+ with our Fan Guide series: Brief history of UFC | Biggest fighters to know | Playlist of fights to watch and get excitedWomen's bantamweight becomes a hotbed for superfightsFor a division that has been considered barren and below elite standards for years, and hasn't held a superfight since Amanda Nunes knocked out Cris Cyborg in 2018 to become the GOAT of women's MMA, business is expected to pick up quickly in 2026 at women's bantamweight. Kayla Harrison will defend her 135-pound title against Nunes, who returns from a three-year retirement in January at UFC 324, in a true superfight between former teammates. In addition, flyweight champion Valentina Shevchenko, Nunes' longtime rival, is on the verge of a possible move back up in weight to not only seek the title but possibly a trilogy fight against \"The Lioness.\"The potential of a round-robin of fights in the new year between all three fighters is extra intriguing because each would be considered a true superfight, especially because of how close Shevchenko is to matching Nunes in terms of career accomplishments (not to mention the fact that Harrison has long said her goal is to one day retire as the women's GOAT). But there's even more than that. Not only is two-time champion Julianna Pena still a viable contender, former two-division PFL tournament champion Larisa Pacheco, who delivered Harrison's lone pro defeat in their third meeting in 2022, has been publicly pushing for the UFC to offer her a contract to return to the promotion. Cyborg, meanwhile, the 40-year-old legend who recently won the inaugural PFL featherweight title, has just one more fight on her current PFL deal. It may be a longshot considering Cyborg left UFC in 2019 on acrimonious terms (and has never fought below 140 pounds) but it all adds to the potential of how big 2026 might become. -- Brian Campbell\nHeavyweight sees at least two new championsEvery report on heavyweight champion Tom Aspinall makes it sound more and more likely he will be sidelined for a considerable amount of time after suffering eye injuries due to pokes from Ciryl Gane at UFC 321. While some claimed Aspinall took the easy way out in a fight he was losing, it has become clear the champion's eyes were significantly injured. If Aspinall is going to be out for a significant amount of time, the promotion will need to move on without him for the time being.That would create an interesting situation in a wide-open division. Below Aspinall, the heavyweight division is basically Gane and then a bunch of fighters who all have wins and losses against various other contenders. This could mean a very interesting 2026 in the division, with a title, either undisputed or interim, changing hands at least twice. Hopefully, that would lead to heavyweight finding its footing as a division and being ready for Aspinall's eventual return. -- Brent BrookhouseUFC legends return for Zuffa BoxingZuffa Boxing could breathe new life into the combat careers of aging UFC stars. Nate Diaz, Jorge Masvidal and Anderson Silva are a small handful of high-profile names who boxed after retiring from mixed martial arts. Zuffa Boxing is a convenient landing spot should they, or other legends, want to expand their footprint in that sport. UFC and WWE have prominently cross-promoted under the TKO umbrella. Early signs suggest the same for Zuffa Boxing. There's convenience and value to signing former UFC champions to Zuffa, using them to attract UFC fans to Zuffa's growing boxing roster.\nThe UFC-Zuffa Boxing pipeline also presents opportunities for active UFC fighters. We've seen an influx of active fighters, such as Arman Tsarukyan and Bo Nickal, compete in grappling between UFC bouts. Reigning champion Alex Pereira is among those who have expressed interest in boxing professionally. Zuffa Boxing could allow the UFC roster to box without breaking their existing contractual obligations. -- Shakiel Mahjouri\n            ",

The Baggies sit 18th in the Championship table, seven points off the relegation zone and 10 from the playoffs, chasing stability with their sixth head coach in the four and a half years since they were relegated from the Premier League.With contractual matters still to be finalized before Ramsay's unveiling, there remains as to whether he would be in the dugout on Sunday when West Brom travel to Swansea City in the third round of the FA Cup. After that, they have a free midweek before a home game against Middlesbrough on Friday, Jan. 16.Ramsay has enjoyed success in the first head coaching job of his career, leading Minnesota United to the Eastern Conference semifinals in both of his seasons in charge. That has caught the eye of other clubs in England's second tier before with Southampton understood to have had the 33-year-old on their shortlist before moving for Will Still in the summer. He was also linked with West Brom prior to the appointment of Mason.\nEarlier in his coaching career, Ramsay served as head coach of Chelsea's U23s before working under Erik ten Hag at Manchester United and spending time as assistant manager to the Wales national team.\n            \n    ",

Witten will replace Joe Jon Finley on Brent Venables' staff in Norman.  This will be Witten's first coaching job at the collegiate level. Since 2021 he has been the head coach at Dallas' Liberty Christian School, where he mentors his son, Cooper, the No. 1 linebacker prospect in the class of 2027, per 247Sports. Witten led Liberty to back-to-back state titles from 2023-24. In 2023, Witten also guided Liberty to its first unbeaten season in school history. \nA former third-round pick out of Tennessee in the 2003 NFL Draft, Witten, 43, spent 16 total seasons with the Cowboys. In that span, he was an 11-time Pro Bowler, a two-time first-team All-Pro and a two-time second-team All-Pro. Witten had at least 700 yards receiving each year from 2004-15. Last month, Witten was named a finalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fame's class of 2026 in his first year of eligibility.\nHe holds Dallas franchise records for career receptions (1,215) and yards receiving (12,977). His 72 touchdown receptions rank second in franchise history behind Dez Bryant's 73. Witten's 1,228 receptions and 13,046 career yards are also second all-time among NFL tight ends. Witten initially stepped away from football in 2018 after 15 straight seasons with the Cowboys but then elected to return to Dallas for the 2019 season. He then spent the 2020 campaign with the Las Vegas Raiders before signing a one-day contract with Dallas in Jan. 2021 so he could officially retire as a Cowboy.\nWitten joins an Oklahoma program coming off a College Football Playoff appearance in Venables' fourth season on the job. The Sooners lost in the first round to Alabama to finish the year with a 10-3 record. Venables is 32-20 overall at Oklahoma, including a 16-10 mark (8-8 SEC) in the program's first two seasons as a member of the SEC. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\nThe Chicago Bears and Green Bay Packers have been trading body blows for 105 years. On Saturday, the teams will add one more chapter to the oldest, most played and most storied rivalry in the NFL when they collide in a Super Wild Card Weekend matchup at Soldier Field in Chicago. The showdown will be just the third time the teams have faced each other in the postseason. The first came on Dec. 14, 1941, exactly one week after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The Bears won that day 33-14. The only other playoff matchup came in the NFC Championship Game in January 2011, which the Packers won 21-14 en route to winning the Super Bowl.This season the rivals split their regular season meetings, with the home team winning each time. In the first game, on Dec. 7, Green Bay's Keisean Nixon intercepted Caleb Williams' pass in the end zone to preserve a 28-21 victory. Two weeks later, Chicago overcame a 10-point deficit late in the fourth quarter, with the help of an onside kick recovery, and got a 46-yard touchdown pass in overtime to beat the Packers 22-16. For the third act in the trilogy, Green Bay is a 1.5-point favorite at DraftKings over the Bears.Packers vs. Bears odds\nOpening spread: Packers -1.5 (-108)Opening money line: Bears -105, Packers -115Opening total: 47.5The point spread has remained steady since it opened on Sunday night at DraftKings, though there is still much time for money to come in and the line to move. Remember: Green Bay closed as a 6.5-point favorite in the teams' first meeting at Lambeau Field and Chicago was a slight 1.5-point favorite in the second matchup at Soldier Field, so this week's point spread makes sense, especially when factoring in that the Packers played a little more than half of the second game without quarterback Jordan Love, who went out with a concussion. Love has cleared concussion protocol and is set to play on Saturday.Maybe more interestingly, the total has dropped since opening at 47.5. Perhaps bettors have been swayed by the weather forecast for snow, rain and breezy conditions.Packers betting profile\nOpening win total: 11.5 wins  W/L record: 9-7-1ATS record: 7-10O/U record: 9-8If Green Bay remains favored, the Packers would be the first No. 7 seed to be favored in a playoff game since the playoffs were expanded to 14 teams in 2020. But the Packers are 0-4 over their last four games and haven't won since pass rush monster Micah Parsons was lost for the season with a torn ACL. They're also 1-3 against-the-spread in those games.To be fair, Green Bay also played the last 2.5 games without Love, who's set to return to the lineup on Saturday. Prior to his concussion in Week 16, Love ranked fourth in the league in touchdown-to-interception ratio (3.8) and sixth in passer rating (101.9). On Saturday, he will go up against a Chicago defense that has struggled this season. The Bears ranked 21st in the NFL during the regular season in EPA/play (0.02) and 26th in success rate (46.24%). They relied on forcing turnovers (leading the league with 33 takeaways), but the Packers were a low-turnover team during the regular season, with just 13 giveaways (third lowest in the NFL).Bears betting profile\nOpening win total: 8.5 wins  W/L record: 11-6ATS record: 10-6-1O/U record: 9-8If Chicago remains the underdog, the Bears would become just the second No. 2 seed ever to be the underdog in a playoff opener and the first since the 49ers in the 2011 season. Between the 2019 and 2023 seasons, Chicago failed to cover any of the 10 games against Green Bay, but over the last two seasons, the Bears are 3-1 against-the-spread against their hated rivals from up north. One of the main reasons for Chicago's turnaround against the Packers is Williams. The former No. 1 overall pick has played well in four games against Green Bay, completing 63.6% of his passes for 815 yards and five touchdowns while throwing only one interception. He also has added 125 rushing yards over that time. On Saturday Williams will face a Packers defense that has struggled without Parsons. Over the last four games the Green Bay defense has just four sacks without its pass rushing menace, which is the fewest in the NFL over that time.Packers-Bears prop pick: Josh Jacobs Over 25 rushing yards in each half\nNote: The pick above is NOT the preferred Josh Jacobs prop pick. The one above is just a placeholder for the real pick, which is available at DraftKings: Jacobs to have 25-plus rushing yards in each half (-125). The Packers running back hit this prop in the first matchup against the Bears. He has been dealing with a knee issue for the better part of two months, which has limited his production, but he enters the Wild Card game saying he feels the best he has in six weeks. He's not on the injury report for the first time since Nov. 16.In addition, Jacobs will face a Chicago defense that gave up 134.5 rushing yards per game during the regular season; just five teams allowed more. Also, the weather forecast for Saturday is calling for rain, snow and breezy conditions, which could put more emphasis on running the ball.\n            ",

As well, players in the top 22% of service time between 2-3 years are also eligible. Those latter players are called Super Twos and go through arbitration four times rather than the usual three before being in line for free agency. Big names eligible for arbitration this time around include back-to-back American League Cy Young winner Tarik Skubal of the Tigers, Randy Arozarena of the Mariners, Hunter Brown of the Astros, William Contreras of the Brewers, Gunnar Henderson and Adley Rutschman of the Orioles, and Jazz Chisholm Jr. of the Yankees, among others. As for Thursday's deadline, players file the salary they believe they should be paid in 2026 and teams file the salary they believe the players should be paid for the upcoming season. If the two sides are unable to agree on a figure, they will go to an arbitration hearing where each side will state their case, and a three-person panel will pick either the salary the player filed or the salary the team filed. There's no splitting the difference between the two figures or picking one out of thin air. As such, the system is designed to promote negotiation, and that's typically what happens before a trial is held. Indeed, the vast majority of arbitration-eligible players sign one-year contracts for the coming season prior to the filing deadline. Only a handful actually file salary figures and even fewer go to a hearing. Neither side wants to go to a hearing because the process necessarily entails, on the team side, emphasizing a player's flaws and shortcomings in the name of winning. That can lead to acrimony and a frayed relationship between team and player. \nGenerally speaking, arbitration salaries are based on comparable players at the same service time level. A player with three years of service time who outperformed a player with six years of service time could have a lower 2025 salary because of, well, service time. Service time matters in arbitration. It's not purely about performance. That means the biggest arb-eligible salaries belong to those players who are in the final year of arbitration. Here are the record arbitration salaries heading into this year's deadline: Juan Soto, 2024 Yankees: $31 millionShohei Ohtani, 2023 Angels: $30 millionVladimir Guerrero Jr., 2025 Blue Jays: 28.5 millionMookie Betts, 2020 Dodgers: $27 millionNolan Arenado, 2019 Rockies: $26 millionHere now are some of the notable signings -- and non-signings -- from Thursday's arbitration salary filing deadline thus far.\nOneil Cruz, Pirates, $3.3 million (FanSided)Ernie Clement, Blue Jays, $4.6 million (FanSided)CJ Abrams, Nationals, $5.2 million (FanSided)Riley Greene, Tigers, $5 million (Detroit Free Press)Gavin Lux, Reds, $5.525 million (New York Post)Shea Langeliers, A's, $5.25 million (FanSided)MacKenzie Gore, Nationals, $5.6 million (FanSided)Hunter Brown, Astros, $5.71 million (MLB.com)Brendan Donovan, Cardinals, $5.8 million (St. Louis Post-Dispatch)Bryson Stott, Phillies, $5.9 million (FanSided)George Kirby, Mariners, $6.55 million (FanSided)Jesús Sánchez, Astros, $6.8 million (MLB.com)Adley Rutschman, Orioles, $7.25 million (FanSided)Jhoan Duran, Phillies, $7.5 million (The Athletic)Steven Kwan, Guardians, $7.725 million (FanSided)David Peterson, Mets, $8.1 million (FanSided)Gunnar Henderson, Orioles, $8.5 million (Baltimore Banner)Jeremy Peña, Astros, $9.475 million (MLB.com)Alec Bohm, Phillies, $10.2 million (The Athletic)Daulton Varsho, Blue Jays, $10.75 million (New York Post)Jesus Luzardo, Phillies, $11 million (Philadelphia Inquirer)Taylor Ward, Orioles, $12.175 million (FanSided)Randy Arozarena, Mariners, $15.65 million (FanSided)More to come as additional arb day moves roll out. \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        We move along with the College Football Playoff this week as No. 6 Ole Miss and No. 10 Miami are set to face off Thursday night in the Fiesta Bowl with a spot in the national title game on the line. This is a fascinating semifinal game for both programs, who have only faced off on the gridiron three times before. Their last contest came in 1951, which resulted in a 20-7 win for the Hurricanes. This marks a return to the big stage for Miami, which has not won a national title since 2001. There's no doubting its validity at this point. The Hurricanes, who just snuck into the 12-team field as the last at-large team at No. 10, went on the road and downed No. 7 Texas A&M in the first round before stunning No. 2 Ohio State, the reigning national champions, in the Cotton Bowl. Miami has relied on a strong defense and a resurgent run game to get to this point. While this is Miami's first time on the national stage in over two decades, this is the closest that Ole Miss has ever been to an actual national championship game. The Rebels do claim three national titles, though their latest came at the conclusion of the 1962 season. \nThough their ranking may not reflect it, Ole Miss has found itself in the role of a scrappy underdog after former coach Lane Kiffin abandoned the Rebels for LSU before their playoff run began. That hasn't been a problem for a team that's rallied behind new coach Pete Golding and what's left of Ole Miss' previous staff. Given all the storylines involved, this promises to be one of the most interesting College Football Playoff semifinal games that we have seen in some time. Where to watch Miami vs. Ole Miss liveDate: Thursday, Jan. 8 | Time: 7:30 p.m. ETLocation: State Farm Stadium -- Glendale, ArizonaTV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nMiami vs. Ole Miss: Players to watch in Fiesta Bowl Mark Fletcher Jr., RB, Miami: Miami is slowly learning that it needs to feed Fletcher the ball more. He's been the Hurricanes' offensive hero in their two playoff wins thus far. He torched Texas A&M to the tune of 17 carries for 172 yards in the first round and followed that up with a 19-carry, 90-yard performance against an Ohio State defense that allowed an average of 89.4 yards rushing per game. He also caught a touchdown against the Buckeyes.Malachi Toney, WR, Miami: Though Toney is just a freshman, Miami runs plenty of its offense through him. Given how dynamic it is, it's hard to keep the ball out of his hands. His 94 receptions are a single-season program record, regardless of class, and his 1,008 yards receiving set Miami's freshman record. On top of all that, he's also logged 102 yards and a touchdown rushing and he established himself as one of the nation's most dangerous returners while fielding 18 punts for 271 yards. It's no wonder that he was tabbed as CBS Sports' Freshman of the Year.  Rueben Bain Jr., EDGE, Miami: Bain and his running mate, Akheem Mesidor, have started to wreak havoc on opposing offensive lines. Bain almost singlehandedly controlled the game against Texas A&M, as he demolished the Aggies with three sacks and four tackles for a loss. He had 4.5 sacks entering the College Football Playoff. He followed that up with another sack against Ohio State, marking his third game in a row that he's logged at least one sack. The talent is finally starting to shine through for a player that many pundits see as a top-10 pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. \nTrinidad Chambliss, QB, Ole Miss: At this point, Chambliss is appointment viewing. His story is well-known: a former Division II star that transferred to Ole Miss with absolutely no fanfare and spent the first few games of the year on the bench before he Wally Pipped preseason starter Austin Simmons. The Rebels haven't looked back since, as Chambliss has emerged as the SEC's best quarterback. He's thrown for 3,660 yards and 21 touchdowns and rushed for another 520 yards and eight touchdowns. He's eclipsed 300 yards passing in four out of Ole Miss' last five games, including a 362-yard performance in the Sugar Bowl against Georgia. Suffice to say Chambliss is an absolute nightmare for opposing defenses. Kewan Lacy, RB, Ole Miss: Ole Miss has its own star running back. Lacy has been one of the greatest breakout stories of this season as, entering the semifinal round, he's rushed 295 times for 1,464 yards and 23 touchdowns. He had two touchdowns against Georgia and averaged just under six yards per carry against Tulane in the first round. Lacy has exceeded 80 yards on the ground in six of Ole Miss' last seven games while averaging a whopping 5.9 yards per attempt. He and Chambliss are the best backfield tandem left in the playoff. Suntarine Perkins, LB, Ole Miss: Ole Miss is going to have to win in the trenches and near the lines of scrimmage if it wants to beat Miami. The versatile Perkins will be a big part of that. Though he's listed as a linebacker on Ole Miss' roster, Perkins wears a lot of hats for the Rebels defense. Sometimes he'll line up as a pass rusher, where he has 11 tackles for loss, three sacks and 11 quarterback hurries. He'll also play in the middle of the field, where he's an effective run stopper and pass coverage specialist. Perkins has five pass breakups and one interception. \nMiami vs. Ole Miss prediction, pick \nLost behind the fact that Ole Miss boasts an explosive offense with Chambliss and Lacy leading the way is the fact that the Rebels have played well defensively with former coordinator and now head coach Pete Golding leading the way. They held eight of their opponents to 21 points or less this season. Miami's defensive dominance is well-documented, while the offense has been inconsistent at times. This has the chance to be a slugfest. Don't be surprised if neither team reaches 30 points. Prediction: Under 51.5 (-105)\n            ",

Police took Lattimore into custody on charges of carrying concealed weapons and improperly handling firearms in a motor vehicle. The Commanders are reportedly aware of the situation, and released a statement to 3News on the arrest: \"We have been made aware of the arrest and are gathering more information. We are in communication with the NFL League Office and have no further comment at this time.\"Lattimore, who starred at Ohio State from 2014-16, recorded 27 combined tackles, seven passes defensed and one interception in nine games played before tearing his ACL in Week 9. Washington traded for him in the middle of last year following seven-and-a-half successful seasons with the New Orleans Saints.The former No. 11 overall pick earned the 2017 NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year award after recording five interceptions and 18 passes defensed. Lattimore quickly emerged into one of the premier cornerbacks in the league, and was named to four Pro Bowls while recording 405 tackles, 88 passes defensed and 15 interceptions in his 97 career games played with New Orleans.\nLattimore has one more year remaining on his deal but is likely to be released this offseason, as he turns 30 years old in May and is coming off a major knee injury. There is no more guaranteed money remaining on the contract, and Washington can save $18.5 million by parting ways with him pre-June 1 or post-June 1. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        In a rather surprising turn of events, Mike McDaniel finds himself without a job. The Miami Dolphins fired him Thursday after four seasons as the franchise's head coach. What makes this a surprise move is the timing of McDaniel's departure. After coming out the other side of Black Monday, it seemed like McDaniel's 5-3 run down the stretch saved him. However, the organization seemed to need more time to digest the 2025 campaign in its entirety, and once they did, it became clear they wanted to go through a full reset after already moving on from GM Chris Grier midseason. Either that, or the arrival of John Harbaugh into the available coaching pool could've been the catalyst for this pivot off of McDaniel. Whatever the reason, the 42-year-old McDaniel is now looking into the abyss of his NFL career and asking what's next. \n        \n            \n                NFL coach, GM interview tracker, updates: Vance Joseph drawing plenty of interest\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHe leaves behind a tenure in Miami where he went 35-35 overall. That includes a 0-2 playoff record, despite helping the Dolphins reach the postseason in each of his first two seasons. In the years since, however, the Dolphins posted back-to-back under-.500 campaigns, including the 2025 season, when the team went 7-10 and featured McDaniel benching Tua Tagovailoa. \nWith that behind him, let's look ahead and identify a couple of landing spots for McDaniel as both a head coach and an offensive coordinator. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Cleveland Browns (HC)In some instances, we see a former head coach either take a year off or return to a coordinator role after being fired. However, there are times when a coach jumps into an opportunity right away, and that could be the case for a number of candidates this cycle, which includes McDaniel. After firing Kevin Stefanski, the Cleveland Browns are interested in McDaniel for their coaching vacancy, according to Cleveland.com. Of course, McDaniel does have a prior history with the organization, working as their wide receivers coach in 2014 under then-head coach Mike Pettine and then-offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan. The report notes that the Browns have long admired McDaniel's offensive mind, so this is a landing spot worth paying close attention to. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Washington Commanders (OC)When it comes to trying to figure out landing spots for any available figure in the NFL, whether it be a player or coach, it comes down to relationships. As this relates to McDaniel, the Commanders make a lot of sense in that regard. Of course, they need an offensive coordinator after parting ways with Kliff Kingsbury, and there are multiple connections within that organization to the former Dolphins coach. \nHe worked on Dan Quinn's staff as an offensive assistant from 2015 to 2016 when the Commanders head coach was leading the Atlanta Falcons. So, from a coaching standpoint, there is familiarity with McDaniel. That's also the case on the personnel side, as well with general manager Adam Peters. Before coming to Washington, Peters was the vice president of player personnel for the San Francisco 49ers from 2017 to 2020. McDaniel was the run game coordinator under Kyle Shanahan throughout Peters' tenure before ascending to OC in 2021.  The chance to coach an offense around Jayden Daniels would certainly be appealing to McDaniel. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Detroit Lions (OC)The Detroit Lions are coming off a disappointing 2025 season that saw them finish with a 9-8 record and in last place in the NFC South. While injuries played a part in their demise this season, the absence of Ben Johnson and the inability to properly replace him were factors as well. During the season, head coach Dan Campbell took over offensive play-calling duties from offensive coordinator John Morton, who has since been fired. Detroit has one of the deepest collections of talent on offense in the entire NFL, ranging from wideout Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jameson Williams to running backs Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery, tight end Sam LaPorta, and, of course, quarterback Jared Goff. If there was anyone capable of getting this group back to firing on all cylinders, it'd be McDaniel. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Tampa Bay Buccaneers (OC)Tampa Bay is another team undergoing some rather seismic changes, but not at the head coaching spot. The Bucs are keeping Todd Bowles intact, but he has since started making big changes to his staff, including firing offensive coordinator Josh Grizzard after just one season. This would be another appealing destination for McDaniel if a head coaching opportunity isn't available to him this cycle, as the Buccaneers boast plenty of talent on the offensive side of the ball. Seeing what McDaniel would do with a quarterback like Baker Mayfield and skill position players like Mike Evans, Chris Godwin, Emeka Egbuka, and Bucky Irving would be fascinating.  Wherever Robert Salah gets hired (OC)This is a bit of a wild-card scenario because we don't know whether Robert Saleh will actually be hired this cycle. However, he has received interest from teams. If he does land a job, McDaniel would make a lot of sense as his offensive coordinator. The two worked together in San Francisco under Kyle Shanahan from 2017 to 2020. Saleh was working as the defensive coordinator at the time, and McDaniel was the run game coordinator. So, there is familiarity between the two, and given that Saleh comes from the defensive side of the ball, it'd be wise for him to secure one of the better offensive minds in the league as he potentially embarks on his second stint as an NFL head coach. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Miami Dolphins have ripped it down to the studs. Already, the organization was on the hunt for a new general manager after the in-season split with Chris Grier, but now they are also looking for a new head coach. On Thursday, the franchise fired Mike McDaniel after four seasons on the job. This comes after a 7-10 season in 2025 that saw Miami on the outside looking in on the playoffs. Midway through the season, it felt like a foregone conclusion that McDaniel was going to be gone, particularly as the team limped out to a 2-7 start to the year. However, Miami rebounded a bit down the stretch, going 5-3 over its final eight games, which led to some momentum being built for McDaniel to keep his job. Once he emerged from Black Monday intact, all signs pointed to McDaniel sticking around. However, as NFL Media notes, after McDaniel met with chairman Stephen Ross this week to discuss the season, Ross came away with the decision to move in a new direction. So, what's next for Miami? Who will they bring in to help usher in what they hope will be a brighter tomorrow? Let's roll through a handful of potential candidates that make sense. Follow live updates on NFL coaching and GM changes, firings and rumors.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    John HarbaughPrevious position: Ravens head coachThere are a couple of angles that have our antenna raised when it comes to John Harbaugh possibly being the top target of the Miami Dolphins, and maybe even the catalyst for this McDaniel firing. First, there is the timing of it all. As we noted above, it felt like McDaniel was going to last at least another year, particularly after making it through Black Monday. Fast-forward to Thursday, and he's been kicked to the curb. What's one thing that's changed between Black Monday and Thursday? John Harbaugh became available. Baltimore parted ways with its long-time head coach on Tuesday, and that decision has turned the hiring cycle on its head. While the Ravens feel like they need a new voice in their organization, Harbaugh instantly became the top coach on the market for other clubs, and maybe it forced organizations currently employing a head coach -- like the Dolphins -- to reevaluate.\nThe second angle centers around Miami's ongoing search for a general manager. Los Angeles Chargers assistant GM Chad Alexander is reportedly one of the finalists for the job. If he gets it, that could be even more fuel to the flame for Harbaugh to eventually land with the Dolphins. Alexander spent two decades with the Baltimore Ravens from 1999 to 2019, spending that final decade as the franchise's assistant director of player personnel, working alongside Harbaugh. So, there is already a working relationship between the two, which would bring some much-needed cohesion to Miami. Oh, and Stephen Ross, a Michigan alum and big donor to the university, has ties to the Harbaugh family with John's brother, Jim Harbaugh, leading the Wolverines for nine seasons and to a national championship in 2023. \n        \n            \n                Ravens fire John Harbaugh: Five landing spots for Super Bowl champion coach, including team with no vacancy\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Klint KubiakCurrent position: Seahawks offensive coordinatorWhile we're highlighting Miami's head coach and GM vacancies, let's not ignore the fact that the franchise is also set to move on from quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, either. That sets the Dolphins up to possibly add a young quarterback through the NFL Draft or explore the veteran market. Either way, they'd probably like to have an offensive-minded coach to help ease that essential piece to the organization through. Kubiak, who has been a hot commodity this hiring cycle, has proven that he can create a high-octane NFL offense. In 2024, he had the New Orleans Saints offense punching above its weight class, and now has the Seattle Seahawks offense among the very best in the league. Seattle was third in the league in scoring, eighth in total yards, and Kubiak has even helped Sam Darnold exceed his breakout in Minnesota a year ago. If Miami is still looking for an offensive-minded coach, you couldn't do much better this go around than Kubiak. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Anthony WeaverCurrent position: Dolphins defensive coordinatorWe'll admit that it's somewhat rare to see a team fire its head coach and then simply elevate a member of his staff to replace him, but I do wonder if Miami gives Weaver a look. A part of Miami's turnaround down the stretch was improved play on the defensive side of the ball, and that has led to Weaver becoming one of the more involved candidates this cycle during the interview process. Already, the Cardinals, Falcons, and Ravens have all reportedly put in requests to speak with Weaver about their vacancy, so maybe the Dolphins try to keep someone that the rest of the league values in-house. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Vance JosephCurrent position: Broncos defensive coordinatorVance Joseph was arguably the top coaching candidate on the market before John Harbaugh came into the equation. The 53-year-old coach is looking for his second kick at leading an NFL organization after initially breaking in with the Denver Broncos in 2017 and only lasting two seasons. While that first stint didn't play out as well as he'd hoped, Joseph still has a strong reputation across the league and has developed the 2025 Broncos (returned to the team as its DC under Sean Payton in 2023) into one of the best units in the NFL. Joseph also has ties to the Dolphins organization, serving as their defensive coordinator in 2016 before being hired by Denver to be their head coach. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Jesse MinterCurrent position: Chargers defensive coordinatorJesse Minter's name hasn't been mentioned much in the interview request process this week, but that could change after his Chargers play on Wild Card Weekend. Minter has been viewed as an up-and-coming head coaching candidate, and he could be of particular interest to the Dolphins. Minter is coaching under Jim Harbaugh, who has ties to Stephen Ross due to his time at Michigan. Minter was on Harbaugh's Wolverines staff as his DC from 2022 to 2023 and helped them to their national championship before following Harbaugh to Los Angeles. As we noted, Stephen Ross is entrenched at Michigan and is certainly aware of Minter, 42, so it's possible he could view him as a top candidate, especially if he's looking for a younger coach.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Barcelona may have booked their place in the Supercopa de España final, but now it'll be down to a Madrid derby to see who will join them out of Atlético Madrid and Real Madrid. With the first title of the LaLiga season on the line in this tournament, both of these teams are trailing Barcelona in the league table despite entering with ambitions of winning it. With Xabi Alonso taking over at Real Madrid and adding reinforcements to the squad, and Diego Simeone looking to show that he can still lead Atleti to glory, this derby is one that could have a serious trickle-down effect for the loser.How to watch Atletico Madrid vs. Real Madrid, oddsDate: Thursday, Jan. 8 | Time: 2 p.m. ETLocation: Alinma Bank Stadium at King Abdullah Sport City -- Jeddah, Saudi ArabiaTV: ESPN2 | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)Odds: Atletico Madrid +200; Draw +260; Real Madrid +125Alonso will already need to shuffle his squad as star striker Kylian Mbappe misses out with a knee injury, but during the Club World Cup, backup striker Gonzalo Garcia showed that he's someone who can be relied on, but after Atletico already won the last meeting between these two sides 5-2 back in September, it'll come down to more than just the attack here. Real have also struggled in their recent matches facing top opposition, losing to Liverpool and Inter in Champions League play, all of which is leading to questions about whether Alonso is the best man for the job. While it's still early in his tenure and Real Madrid's injury list hasn't handed him any favors, the weight of the Real Madrid job comes with sometimes unreasonable expectations.It's quite a contrast to Atletico Madrid, where Diego Simeone has become an institution, leading the team since 2011. While he's won LaLiga twice, the Europa League twice, and the Copa Del Rey, the investment in the club as of late calls for more. Splashing out €176 milion ahead of the season on new signings, expectations are there for the squad to compete at the highest level and while Real Madrid have been the more successful side recently this Atleti side has trophies on their mind.With this already being a rivalry, there's another layer added to the mix when a loss could lead to significant downstream changes. Both teams are taking part in Champions League play, but the easiest path to a trophy is one that takes the fewest wins. Barcelona may be waiting on the other side, but either of these teams are two wins from creating a defining moment in their seasons. Both are in need of a trophy to kickstart their seasons, and that should lead to quite a chess match on the pitch.\nUnfortunately, only one team can emerge with a victory, but that's how soccer works at the highest level. After the first match between these two ended in a lopsided score, the goal will be ensuring that at least for the team that falters on Thursday, it's a closer margin.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Baltimore Ravens' search to find John Harbaugh's successor will include interviewing Brian Flores, the Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator who formerly served as the Miami Dolphins head coach. Flores' meeting with Baltimore will be his first interview for a vacant head coaching position during his hiring cycle, which is somewhat surprising given his previous NFL experience. Follow live updates on NFL coaching and GM changes, firings and rumors.The 44-year-old broke into the NFL in 2004 as a scouting assistant with the New England Patriots. That season, the Patriots won their third Super Bowl over a four-year span. Two years later, Flores was promoted to a pro scout, and in 2008, he was promoted to Bill Belichick's coaching staff as a special teams assistant. Flores continued to move up the ladder in New England over the next several years and was the team's de facto defensive coordinator when the Patriots held the Rams to just three points in Super Bowl LIII. In all, Flores won four Super Bowls in New England while serving in a multitude of roles. \nShortly after the Patriots' Super Bowl win over the Rams, Flores was hired to be the Dolphins' coach. Despite posting back-to-back winning seasons, Flores was relieved of his duties after just three seasons. Shortly after his firing, Flores sued the NFL, the Dolphins, Giants and Broncos alleging racial discrimination. \n        \n            \n                Court of Appeals upholds ruling in Brian Flores' lawsuit vs. the NFL; three teams could go to trial\n                \n                    Bryan DeArdo                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nJust over a month after being fired, Flores found another job in the NFL as the Steelers' senior defensive assistant and linebackers coach ahead of the 2022 season. That season, he was credited with helping Pittsburgh's defense finish 10th in the NFL in points allowed, ninth in rushing yards allowed and first in interceptions recorded. \nAfter one season in Pittsburgh, Flores joined Kevin O'Connell's staff in Minnesota as defensive coordinator. Over the past two seasons, Minnesota's defense has ranked fifth and seventh, respectively, in the NFL in fewest points allowed. The past season, the Vikings' defense was also second in the NFL in passing yards and touchdown passes allowed, fourth in third-down efficiency and second in red zone efficiency. \"He's a phenomenal coach,\" Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers said of Flores ahead of Pittsburgh's Week 4 matchup with Minnesota. \"He was here a few years ago. ... It's good to see him in a position of leadership. I feel like he probably should, at some point, get another [head] coaching job based on the way that he's coached defense last couple years. The schemes they run and the way they're coached, there's a lot of really good chemistry and continuity on that side that doesn't just come from players. There's a schematic part of that. It's really impressive.\"Baltimore is in the process of trying to find a new head coach for just the fourth time in franchise history since the team moved from Cleveland to Baltimore after the 1995 season. Harbaugh, who was relieved of his duties earlier in the week, is the franchise's all-time leader in virtually every category, including wins with 180. He also holds the NFL record with eight road wins in the postseason. \nThe Ravens' roster includes a two-time league MVP in quarterback Lamar Jackson, a player Flores raved about prior to Minnesota's regular season matchup with Baltimore this season:\"He's improved and gotten better in all areas of his game. He's a perennial MVP candidate year after year. I think when people talk about him or think about him, you think about the dynamic runs and the scrambles and the off schedule plays. But this guy's an excellent passer of the football. So defensively, you're dealing with everything. ... He's certainly improved and gotten a lot better in all facets of his game. Leadership, command of the offense, acumen, deep balls, intermediate, short scrambles, I mean, all of it.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 NFL playoffs are here, and this season has been one of the most fascinating seasons we've seen in quite some time. Not only are Patrick Mahomes, Joe Burrow and Lamar Jackson at home on the couch, but no one could have predicted the Denver Broncos and Seattle Seahawks would be the No. 1 seeds in their respective conferences. Could Matthew Stafford and the Los Angeles Rams rebound from their disappointing end to the season to make a run to the Super Bowl? Will Josh Allen finally get the Buffalo Bills to the big stage, or maybe Drake Maye and the New England Patriots are for real despite playing the easiest strength of schedule since the 1999 Rams. Remember, that team ended up winning the Super Bowl. We asked 10 of our CBS Sports NFL experts to turn in their full NFL playoff brackets. Not just Super Bowl picks. We wanted to see their work and how they got there. Let's take a look. 2025-26 NFL Playoff bracket picksPete Prisco\"This is the most wide-open playoffs I can remember. With no dominant teams, I expect chaos. That would be the Jaguars winning it all. Of all the teams, they might be the most balanced. They aren't great at anything, but they don't have as many flaws as the others. They are also riding the hottest quarterback in the league. As for the Eagles, they will find their offense in the playoffs. It's back to Saquon Barkley and the running game. That will carry them to the Super Bowl, but the Jaguars and their top-ranked run defense will limit him on the biggest stage to win the team's first Super Bowl.\"\nJP Acosta\n                                                                    CBS Sports Design\n                                                            \"The Rams have been the most complete team in the NFL, with an offense that can both grind out tough wins and go head-to-head in shootouts with anyone left in the league. They also have a pass rush that can put any opposing offense on its back foot and give them the advantage. While I'm worried about RG Kevin Dotson's injury, if WR Davante Adams comes back healthy, this offense has enough to win a Super Bowl. While the NFC is sort of chalk with arguably the four best teams left making the divisional round, the AFC is where we get wild. The Jaguars are one of the hottest teams in the NFL, with an offense that can go toe to toe with everyone in the league, and they are well-coached on both sides of the ball. If they can get past the Bills in the Wild Card round, there might not be another team that could stop their momentum. Both the one and two seeds in the AFC get bounced in the divisional, with both facing bad matchups in the two AFC South teams left.\"John Breech\"After one of the most unpredictable seasons in NFL history, it only makes sense that we end up with a Super Bowl matchup that's never happened before, and that's what we would be getting here with a five-seed facing a six-seed in the big game for the first time ever. In the NFC, there is no team I trust more than the Rams. Matthew Stafford is the only QB I trust against a Seahawks defense that has been terrorizing everyone. I think the Eagles could be a threat in the NFC, but asking them to potentially beat the 49ers, Rams and Seahawks all in a row is just too much. In the AFC, I'm rolling with the Texans. There's a reason they say that defense wins championships, and right now, the Texans have the best defense in the NFL. The Texans have already beaten some of the AFC's best teams (Bills, Jaguars, Chargers), which gives me even more confidence that they'll get to the Super Bowl. If the Rams and Texans meet, it would be a rematch of a Week 1 game that Los Angeles won 14-9. Both teams have come a long way since then, but I think it would be another defensive struggle with the Rams taking home their second Lombardi Trophy in five years.\"Jordan Dajani\"I don't have many surprises in the wild-card round, except the Jaguars upsetting the Bills. I view Jacksonville as the real sleeper in the AFC, not Buffalo. Think about it, Trevor Lawrence is one of the hottest quarterbacks in the NFL right now and Anthony Campanile's defense ranks No. 2 in takeaways. The divisional round is where things get interesting. I have the Jaguars upsetting the Patriots in New England, the Rams upsetting the No. 1-seeded Seahawks and the reigning Super Bowl champion Eagles beating the Bears in Chicago. Yes, three road teams winning in the divisional round. In the conference championships, the Broncos end the Jaguars' Super Bowl dreams, while the Rams get revenge for their divisional-round loss in Philadelphia last year. This could be Matthew Stafford's final season, so I have him ending his Hall of Fame career atop the NFL world. Not only is he the MVP this year, but he has a loaded arsenal of weapons and enough talent on defense. The Rams were my preseason pick to win the NFC, and now I'm taking them to win the Super Bowl.\"\nDoug Clawson\"Nobody circles the wagons like the Buffalo Bills. This is finally going to be the Bills' year. They will capitalize on the most wide-open Super Bowl race in NFL history, one without Patrick Mahomes, Lamar Jackson and Joe Burrow on their side of the bracket. Josh Allen will play flawlessly and the Bills' No. 1 rushing attack will control the clock and keep their flawed defense on the sidelines as much as possible. It's going to take a dramatic comeback or two, including one in the Super Bowl, to beat the best team in the league, the Los Angeles Rams. A Super Bowl between a six and five seed only seems fitting given the year of parity. It would be the first Super Bowl between five or worse seeds ever.\"Tyler Sullivan\"I think we're all overlooking just how dominant Trevor Lawrence and the Jaguars have been down the stretch. Inside the confines of EverBank Stadium, they send Josh Allen packing. Then, they end Drake Maye's season in Foxborough, and follow that up with a trip back down to Jacksonville for a meeting with their division foe, the Texans, in the AFC Championship. I give them the edge there to reach their first-ever Super Bowl, but that's as high as they fly. I lean toward championship experience in the NFC, with Matthew Stafford continuing what looks like an MVP season and lifting his second Lombardi Trophy during his Rams tenure. Meanwhile, given how unpredictable this season has been, don't be surprised to see BOTH No. 1 seeds on upset alert coming out of their respective bye weeks.\"Garrett Podell\"It's an all-AFC South conference championship game, while two of the best quarterbacks in the league, Jordan Love and Matthew Stafford, power their respective squads to the NFC title game. The Jaguars entered the postseason on an eight-game winning streak with quarterback Trevor Lawrence leading the entire NFL in total touchdowns (24) since Week 11. Lawrence's 38 total touchdowns this season are the third-most in the league behind only 2024 NFL MVP Josh Allen (39) and Stafford (46). The Rams' wide receiver duo of Puka Nacua and Davante Adams proves to be too much for the Packers' depleted defense, and Sean McVay knocks off pupil Liam Coen to hoist a second Vince Lombardi trophy.\"\nZach Pereles\"I've been on the Rams Super Bowl train for quite a while, and I think the healthy returns of Davante Adams, Alaric Jackson and Quentin Lake are not to be overlooked. Adams, of course, is the biggest addition, and his red-zone abilities are crucial, especially for a team that can struggle in short yardage. Jackson and Lake plug key holes in the offensive line and secondary, respectively. The Patriots make a run through a wide-open AFC thanks to Drake Maye's tremendous playmaking, but the biggest surprise here might just be neither the Bills (Josh Allen) nor the Broncos (No. 1 seed) winning a game. The Texans' nightmare-causing defense fuels an upset in Denver in the Divisional Round, and there's just not enough around Allen on either side of the ball, even if the narrative is that it's his year, given Patrick Mahomes' absence.\"Jared Dubin\"I truly have absolutely no idea who to pick in either conference, so I went with a chaos scenario of two wild card teams making the Super Bowl, and the winner being the No. 5 seed from the NFC. The Rams seemed like the best team in the NFL for much of the season, only to lose the division title and top seed in the conference due to that crazy game against the Seahawks. They might have to go on the road three times to even make it to the Super Bowl, but I trust Matthew Stafford and Sean McVay to do it. On the AFC side of the bracket, I just think Josh Allen is the best quarterback, and in the absence of feeling comfortable with any particular team, I decided to back them. Do I have much confidence that any of this will play out the way I predicted? I do not. But you've got to predict something, and this is where I landed.\"Bryan DeArdo\"For only the eighth time, the Super Bowl champion will be a team that didn't win its division. I'm actually predicting that both Super Bowl participants will be wild card teams. Buffalo has the league's reigning MVP, Josh Allen, and the NFL's leading rusher, James Cook, at its disposal. The Rams have one of this year's leading MVP candidates in Matt Stafford, a dynamic receiving corps and one of the league's best defenses. In the Super Bowl, I've got the Bills edging the Rams in what would be an intriguing matchup if it comes to fruition.\"\n            ",

To varying degrees, each team has a rookie class to thank for its appearance. Reflecting back upon the season, CBSSports.com ranks each playoff representative by the successes and failures of those players. The results illustrate there is not a singular path that must be taken to reach the playoffs. Some teams may have only had one or two key contributors, whereas others may have had four or five rookies play rotational snaps, but no difference makers. The prevailing thought is that fans of non-playoff teams should have hope their franchise is capable of finding the missing piece(s) this offseason.Without further ado, here is each NFL playoff team ranked by the the output of their rookie class, from worst to first:\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    14. Jacksonville JaguarsCB/WR Travis Hunter, Colorado (Round 1, No. 2 overall)CB Caleb Ransaw, Tulane (Round 3, No. 88 overall) OT Wyatt Milum, West Virginia (Round 3, No. 89 overall)RB Bhayshul Tuten, Virginia Tech (Round 4, No. 104 overall)LB Jack Kiser, Notre Dame (Round 4, No. 107 overall)LB Jalen McLeod, Auburn (Round 6, No. 194 overall)S Rayuan Lane III, Navy (Round 6, No. 200 overall)OL Jonah Monheim, USC (Round 7, No. 221 overall)RB LeQuint Allen, Syracuse (Round 7, No. 236 overall)Hunter was not awful, but relative to expectations, he did not have a season that lived up to the hype. It also ended prematurely on injured reserve. Ransaw's season was over before it started as well due to injury. Tuten and Allen factored into the run game after Tank Bigsby was traded to Philadelphia, but they were never really more than complementary pieces to Travis Etienne. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    13. Los Angeles RamsTE Terrance Ferguson, Oregon (Round 2, No. 46 overall)EDGE Josaiah Stewart, Michigan (Round 3, No. 90 overall)RB Jarquez Hunter, Auburn (Round 4, No. 117 overall)DL Ty Hamilton, Ohio State (Round 5, No. 148 overall)LB Chris Paul Jr., Ole Miss (Round 5, No. 172 overall)WR Konata Mumpfield, Pittsburgh (Round 7, No. 242 overall)Stewart has been the best of the bunch -- part of what has become a deep collection of pass rushers for Los Angeles. Still, he was a rotational player, much in the same way as Ferguson and Mumpfield. They could be schemed into making a big play, but the Rams' rookie class is not necessarily a group that's going to take over a game.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    12.

He certainly flashed at times, but did not emerge as the go-to outlet as many had expected. Belton was a part of an offensive line rotation that seemingly changed by the week. Brinson, Sorrell and Nazir Stackhouse played rotational snaps. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    11. San Francisco 49ersEDGE Mykel Williams, Georgia (Round 1, No. 11 overall)DT Alfred Collins, Texas (Round 2, No. 43 overall)LB Nick Martin, Oklahoma State (Round 3, No. 75 overall)CB Upton Stout, Western Kentucky (Round 4, No. 100 overall)DL CJ West, Indiana (Round 4, No. 113 overall)WR Jordan Watkins, Ole Miss (Round 4, No. 138 overall)S Marques Sigle, Kansas State (Round 5, No. 160 overall)QB Kurtis Rourke, Indiana (Round 7, No. 227 overall)IOL Connor Colby, Iowa (Round 7, No. 249 overall)WR Junior Bergen, Montana (Round 7, No. 252 overall)The 49ers had a lot of rookie snaps on the books this season, which wass born out of necessity on the defense. The line had become depleted in recent years, so Williams, Collins and West all played significant snaps. Williams unfortunately suffered a season-ending injury, so the unit remained a point of weakness. Stout is a personal favorite because he plays so much bigger than his size. Sigle also played a lot while others were out due to injury. Colby started six games this season. The scheme is generally capable of covering up a lineman's flaws, which is good for a rookie.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    10.

The offensive draft picks have done absolutely nothing. Harmon and Black have had some flashes this season and could develop into consistent performers for the franchise, but they will be leaning more on established names like T.J. Watt, Alonzo Highsmith and Cam Heyward to will them to the divisional round.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    9. Denver BroncosCB Jahdae Barron, Texas (Round 1, No. 20 overall)RB RJ Harvey, UCF (Round 2, No. 60 overall)WR Pat Bryant, Illinois (Round 3, No. 74 overall)DL Sai'vion Jones, LSU (Round 3, No. 101 overall)EDGE Que Robinson, Alabama (Round 4, No. 134 overall)P Jeremy Crawshaw, Florida (Round 6, No. 216 overall)TE Caleb Lohner, Utah (Round 7, No. 241 overall)Harvey looks like a difference maker in that Denver offense moving forward. He is an explosive talent who has (rightfully) drawn a lot of comparisons to how Sean Payton utilized Alvin Kamara. Bryant has also been a consistent contributor for that offense. Those two have been more involved than first-round cornerback Jahdae Barron. Robinson has been a rotational player for the team. Harvey has the best chance to raise the ceiling of this group, but they have gotten multiple contributors at the very least.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    8. Carolina PanthersWR Tetairoa McMillan, Arizona (Round 1, No. 8 overall)EDGE Nic Scourton, Texas A&M (Round 2, No. 51 overall)EDGE Princely Umanmielen, Ole Miss (Round 3, No. 77 overall)RB Trevor Etienne, Georgia (Round 4, No. 114 overall)S Lathan Ransom, Ohio State (Round 4, No. 122 overall)DL Cam Jackson, Florida (Round 5, No. 140 overall)TE Mitchell Evans, Notre Dame (Round 5, No. 163 overall)WR Jimmy Horn Jr., Colorado (Round 6, No. 208 overall)McMillan quickly established himself as one of the better receivers in the league. He amassed 70 receptions for 1,014 yards and seven touchdowns during the regular season. Evans was part of what amounted to a strong rookie tight end class league-wide. Carolina desperately needed some young building blocks on defense after ransacking the unit for the betterment of the offense. Scourton finished the season with seven tackles for a loss and 5.0 sacks. Those results were not necessarily flashy, but he raised the floor of the position and gave fans some confidence regarding the future. Ransom played a modest snap share as well. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Buffalo BillsCB Maxwell Hairston, Kentucky (Round 1, No. 30 overall)DL T.J. Sanders, South Carolina (Round 2, No. 41 overall)EDGE Landon Jackson, Arkansas (Round 3, No. 72 overall)DL Deone Walker, Kentucky (Round 4, No. 109 overall)CB Jordan Hancock, Ohio State (Round 5, No. 170 overall)TE Jackson Hawes, Georgia Tech (Round 5, No. 173 overall)CB Dorian Strong, Virginia Tech (Round 6, No. 177 overall)OT Chase Lundt, UCONN (Round 6, No. 206 overall)WR Kaden Prather, Maryland (Round 7, No. 240 overall)Hairston missed a sizable amount of the season due to injury and then was worked back into the rotation when he returned. Everyone remembers the game against the Chiefs when he went stride for stride with Xavier Worthy downfield. The goal should be him working towards being a full-time player in 2026. \nHairston's college teammate, Walker, was also a bright spot for the organization. Once regarded as a potential first-round pick, Walker flashed for a team who battled suspensions and injuries on the interior. Hawes was an animal this season digging out edge rushers and sealing run lanes. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Philadelphia EaglesLB Jihaad Campbell, Alabama (Round 1, No. 31 overall)S Andrew Mukuba, Texas (Round 2, No. 64 overall)DL Ty Robinson, Nebraska (Round 4, No. 111 overall) CB Mac McWilliams, UCF (Round 5, No. 145 overall)LB Smael Mondon Jr., Georgia (Round 5, No. 161 overall)IOL Drew Kendall, Boston College (Round 5, No. 168 overall)QB Kyle McCord, Syracuse (Round 6, No. 181 overall)OT Myles Hinton, Michigan (Round 6, No. 191 overall)OT Cameron Williams, Texas (Round 6, No. 207 overall)EDGE Antwaun Powell-Ryland, Virginia Tech (Round 6, No. 209 overall)The Eagles had nine rookies play snaps for them this season, but Campbell and Mukuba were the only two who became starters at some point. Campbell is rangy playing sideline to sideline and is capable of delivering a big moment in the playoffs. Mukuba had two interceptions in the regular season. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Seattle SeahawksOG Grey Zabel, North Dakota State (Round 1, No. 18 overall)S Nick Emmanwori, South Carolina (Round 2, No. 35 overall)TE Elijah Arroyo, Miami (Round 2, No. 50 overall)QB Jalen Milroe, Alabama (Round 3, No. 92 overall)DL Rylie Mills, Notre Dame (Round 5, No. 142 overall)WR Tory Horton, Colorado State (Round 5, No. 166 overall)TE Robbie Ouzts, Alabama (Round 5, No. 175 overall)OL Bryce Cabeldue, Kansas (Round 6, No. 192 overall)RB Damien Martinez, Miami (Round 7, No. 223 overall)OL Mason Richman, Iowa (Round 7, No. 234 overall)WR Ricky White III, UNLV (Round 7, No. 238 overall)Seattle had two rookies -- Emmanwori and Zabel -- who set the tone on their respective side of the ball. The latter is a physical player who has allowed the run game to become more consistent. The former is a long body, like Kyle Hamilton, who can muddy pass lanes and impact the play when the ball is not even coming his direction. Horton, Ouzts and Arroyo were all part of the rotation as well. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Los Angeles Chargers RB Omarion Hampton, North Carolina (Round 1, No. 22 overall)WR Tre Harris, Ole Miss (Round 2, No. 55 overall)DL Jamaree Caldwell, Oregon (Round 3, No. 86 overall)EDGE Kyle Kennard, South Carolina (Round 4, No. 125 overall)WR KeAndre Lambert-Smith, Auburn (Round 5, No. 158 overall)TE Oronde Gadsden II, Syracuse (Round 5, No. 165 overall)OT Branson Taylor, Pittsburgh (Round 6, No. 199 overall)S R.J. Mickens, Clemson (Round 6, No. 214 overall)CB Trikweze Bridges, Florida (Round 7, No. 256 overall)Hampton was in the dog house early in the season as he settled in as a pass protector, and an injury cost him some time as well. However, when on the field, Hampton was a net positive for the Chargers' offense. Harris played a lot of snaps for a team that was seeking out a vertical threat in its pass game. For about a month, there was not a hotter rookie in the NFL than Gadsden. Over a four-week period, he amassed 24 receptions, which was nearly half of his season-long total, for 377 yards and two touchdowns. On the defensive side of the ball, Caldwell executed his role as a run stuffer and Mickens played significantly in the secondary. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Houston TexansWR Jayden Higgins, Iowa State (Round 2, No. 34 overall)OT Aireontae Ersery, Minnesota (Round 2, No. 48 overall)WR Jaylin Noel, Iowa State (Round 3, No. 79 overall)CB Jaylin Smith, USC (Round 3, No. 97 overall)RB Woody Marks, USC (Round 4, No. 116 overall)S Jaylen Reed, Penn State (Round 6, No. 187 overall)QB Graham Mertz, Florida (Round 6, No. 197 overall)DL Kyonte Hamilton, Rutgers (Round 7, No. 224 overall)TE Luke Lachey, Iowa (Round 7, No. 255 overall)Higgins was a very good rookie receiver this season and Noel had moments of his own. The two players combined for 817 receiving yards and eight touchdowns. Their presence allowed the team to account for the loss of Tank Dell and rebound from a down 2024 season. \nMarks was among the best rookie running backs in the league this year, but he struggled to stay healthy. Houston used a platoon system including Nick Chubb to replace Joe Mixon. Ersery allowed nine sacks and 30 pressures this season, according to TruMedia. It was the volatile season that many should have expected from a rookie. The defensive backs were there to step in when injuries arose. Only time will tell if they fulfill larger roles, but four contributors is a great early return. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. New England PatriotsOT Will Campbell, LSU (Round 1, No. 4 overall)RB TreVeyon Henderson, Ohio State (Round 2, No. 38 overall)WR Kyle Williams, Washington State (Round 3, No. 69 overall)C Jared Wilson, Georgia (Round 3, No. 95 overall)S Craig Woodson, California (Round 4, No. 106 overall)DL Joshua Farmer, Florida State (Round 4, No. 137 overall)EDGE Bradyn Swinson, LSU (Round 5, No. 146 overall)K Andres Borregales, Miami (Round 6, No. 182 overall)OT Marcus Bryant, Missouri (Round 7, No. 220 overall)IOL Julian Ashby, Vanderbilt (Round 7, No. 251 overall)CB Kobee Minor, Memphis (Round 7, No. 257 overall)New England is a team who invested in young players and played them early -- a decision that paid dividends over the course of the season. Campbell was the crown jewel as the No. 4 overall selection. He played well for a rookie tackle, but was credited with six sacks and 19 pressures allowed by TruMedia.\nHenderson started off the season slow, but was explosive over the last two months, racking up 911 rushing yards and nine rushing touchdowns this season. Wilson and Woodson were starters this season, and a handful of others contributed at one point or another. It was a really encouraging season for a class widely regarded as one of the best in April. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Chicago BearsTE Colston Loveland, Michigan (Round 1, No. 10 overall)WR Luther Burden III, Missouri (Round 2, No. 39 overall)OT Ozzy Trapilo, Boston College (Round 2, No. 56 overall)DT Shemar Turner, Texas A&M (Round 2, No. 62 overall)LB Ruben Hyppolite II, Maryland (Round 4, No. 132 overall)CB Zah Frazier, UTSA (Round 5, No. 169 overall)OT Luke Newman, Michigan State (Round 6, No. 195 overall)RB Kyle Monangai, Rutgers (Round 7, No. 233 overall)One's impression of Chicago's rookie class would have changed drastically from Week 8 to the end of the regular season. Loveland, Burden and Monangai all emerged as viable threats in a dynamic Bears offense. Trapilo stepped in at left tackle and finished the season having allowed two sacks and 14 pressures on nearly 300 pass blocking snaps, according to TruMedia. Those contributions overshadowed the defensive draft picks, as rookies on that side of the ball played a total of 105 defensive snaps.\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        The end of the regular season doesn't just close the book on another year in the NFL. For some franchises, it also coincides with a reevaluation of the entire organization, which can result in various firings. While some clubs made changes midseason, the more common time we see head coaches and GMs be let go comes the day after the regular season concludes, better known as Black Monday. Already, we've seen six teams fire their now-former head coach (Falcons, Browns, Cardinals, Raiders, Ravens, and Dolphins) and one club also rid itself of its general manager (Falcons) -- the Dolphins fired their GM midseason. Pair that with the two head coaching vacancies (Giants and Titans) that were already open due to firings during the season, and you have 25% of the league looking for a new head coach. So, who fills them? With the Band-Aid ripped off, those teams are now beginning the process of finding their next leader. Below, we'll chronicle that pursuit by tracking the latest interview requests by each team. Follow live updates on NFL coaching and GM changes, firings and rumors.Head coaches\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Arizona CardinalsPrevious head coach: Jonathan GannonAfter three seasons on the job, the Cardinals decided to move on from Jonathan Gannon. He went 15-36 as the organization's head coach, which included a 3-14 season in 2025. Arizona ended the year on a nine-game losing streak. The Cardinals have made the playoffs once in the last 10 seasons. \nInterview requestsVance Joseph -- Broncos defensive coordinator (ESPN)Robert Saleh -- 49ers defensive coordinator (NBC)Antony Weaver -- Dolphins defensive coordinator (ESPN)Klint Kubiak -- Seahawks offensive coordinator (Sports Illustrated)Thomas Brown -- Patriots passing game coordinator (NFL Media)Matt Nagy -- Chiefs offensive coordinator (NFL Media)Raheem Morris -- former Falcons head coach (ESPN)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Atlanta FalconsPrevious head coach: Raheem MorrisAfter two seasons on the job, the Falcons fired Morris in the aftermath of a disappointing 2025 campaign.

Harbaugh was the NFL's second-longest tenured head coach after Mike Tomlin in Pittsburgh, who knocked him out of the playoffs with a Week 18 victory that may have clinched his departure. While this is the end of an era in Baltimore, the Ravens suddenly become the top available job in the NFL simply due to the presence of two-time NFL MVP Lamar Jackson. Completed interviewsVance Joseph -- Broncos defensive coordinator (team announced)Interview requestsAnthony Weaver -- Dolphins defensive coordinator (The Athletic)Klint Kubiak -- Seahawks offensive coordinator (NFL Media)Brian Flores -- Vikings defensive coordinator (NFL Media)Matt Nagy -- Chiefs offensive coordinator (NFL Media)Davis Webb -- Broncos quarterbacks coach (ESPN)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Cleveland BrownsPrevious head coach: Kevin StefanskiCleveland moved on from Kevin Stefanski after a 5-12 season in 2025 that saw the franchise finish last in the AFC North.

The Raiders finished with the worst record in the NFL (3-14) and now possess the No. 1 overall pick at the 2026 NFL Draft. General manager John Spytek and minority owner Tom Brady are expected to spearhead the coaching search. Interview requestsVance Joseph -- Broncos defensive coordinator (ESPN)Klint Kubiak -- Seahawks offensive coordinator (Sports Illustrated)Davis Webb -- Broncos quarterbacks coach (ESPN)Matt Nagy -- Chiefs offensive coordinator (NFL Media)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Miami DolphinsPrevious head coach: Mike McDanielThe Dolphins waited a bit longer to make a decision regarding Mike McDaniel's future with the organization, firing him on the Thursday afte the regular season. Initially, it looked as if McDaniel had saved his job, but Stephen Ross, after a meeting this week to discuss the season, decided to cut bait and go through a total reset. It's slated to be transformative offseason in Miami, as it now needs a new head coach and general manager and is likely to move on from Tua Tagovailoa. Interview requestsTo be announced.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New York GiantsPrevious head coach: Brian DabollNew York fired Daboll midway through the 2025 season after a 2-8 start to the year. He'd been at his post since 2022 and went 20-40-1 over his tenure in the regular season.

He had been with the organization in this GM role since 2021 and was able to add some intriguing skill position players like Bijan Robinson and Drake London, but was unable to get a concrete plan in place at quarterback. A clear plan at that position will likely be the main emphasis for owner Arthur Blank as he combs through candidates this time around. Interview requestsIan Cunningham -- Bears assistant general manager (CBS Sports lead NFL insider Jonathan Jones)Josh Williams -- 49ers director of scouting and football operations (CBS Sports lead NFL insider Jonathan Jones) (for President of Football role)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Miami DolphinsPrevious GM: Chris GrierIt was a rather seismic decision by the Dolphins and Grier to mutually part ways during the 2025 season, simply due to how long his tenure had been with the organization. He started as a scout in 2000 and stayed with the franchise ever since, ascending to GM in 2016. Miami made the playoffs just three times over his 10-year stint as GM, and has been under .500 in each of the last two seasons, due to an inability to build a stable roster. \nUpcoming in-person interviewsChad Alexander -- Chargers assistant general manager (team announced)Champ Kelly -- Dolphins interim general manager (team announced)Jon-Eric Sullivan -- Packers VP of player personnel (team announced)Josh Williams -- 49ers director, scouting and football operations (team announced)\n            ",

    "body": "\n        History could be made at UFC 323. On Saturday in Las Vegas, bantamweight champion Merab Dvalishvili could become the only UFC fighter to make four successful title defenses in one calendar year. With so much attention on the legacy-defining feat, the undercard risks being overshadowed.UFC 323 features not only two title fights, but also former champions in every main card bout. Former two-division titleholder Henry Cejudo, ex-flyweight king Brandon Moreno and one-time light heavyweight ruler Jan Blachowicz are all in action. It's a solid undercard supporting what could be the most unique achievement in UFC history.Take a look at three undercard fights worth your time, plus three honorable mentions, before the last UFC pay-per-view preceding the Paramount+ era.\n        \n            \n                Merab Dvalishvili's shot at UFC history among top storylines to watch at UFC 323 in Las Vegas\n                \n                    Brian Campbell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHenry Cejudo vs. Payton TalbottCejudo is expected to retire again on Saturday. His success before and after his first retirement couldn't be more different. He walked away from the sport in 2023, having become a two-division UFC champion and a successful bantamweight title defense. In his second stint, he's 0-3 and fighting an unranked opponent. But Cejudo's winless stretch doesn't tell the whole story. He took bantamweight champion Aljamain Sterling to a split decision in his first fight in three years. Then he lost to Merab Dvalishvili, who'd go on to become arguably the best bantamweight ever. Against Song Yadong, Cejudo was fighting relatively well before an eye poke ruined everything.\nThe Talbott fight is unusual but inspired matchmaking. Talbott is a non-conformist among the regular MMA circle, drawing attention beyond the sport. He's an unfinished product, but he can fight his ass off. Talbott gave up 11 takedowns in his last two fights. If he can't fend off Olympic gold medalist Cejudo, the former champion can ride off into the sunset happily. But if Talbott gets it done, we have a new star player among the bantamweight elite.\nBrandon Moreno vs. Tatsuro TairaA UFC flyweight title shot could be at stake for the winner of this fight. Two-time former champion Moreno found himself on the outside looking in after consecutive split decision losses to Pantoja and Brandon Royval. After a six-month break, Moreno reemerged as a contender by knocking off young guns Amir Albazi and Steve Erceg. On Saturday, Moreno has another chance to prove that the new wave of flyweights isn't ready to take over. Taira is an impressive contender with a slick submission game. Taira (17-1) bounced back from a split decision, Fight of the Night loss to Royval by submitting Hyun Sung Park. Taira would be a fresh matchup for Pantoja or Van. Moreno hasn't fought Van either, but has a rich history with Pantoja.Terrance McKinney vs. Chris Duncan  McKinney fights are feast and famine, always. He's never reached a decision, win or lose, in 24 pro fights. There's very little reason to suspect he'll break that chain on Saturday. McKinney has never chained together more than two consecutive wins in the UFC, but the second half of his Octagon run looks better than the first. He's on a 4-1 run with consecutive finishes over Viacheslav Borshchev (submission) and Damir Hadzovic (KO). Scotland's Duncan is a solid prospect at 4-1 in the UFC and 14-2 overall. A known KO artist on the regional scene, including in the \"Contender Series\" fight that earned him a UFC contract, Duncan has successfully incorporated submission wins into his repertoire since joining the promotion. Duncan is a slight favorite against the inconsistent McKinney, but the fight should be memorable whichever way it goes.\nHonorable mentions: Jan Blachowicz vs. Bogdan Guskov, Maycee Barber vs. Karine Silva, and Edson Barboza vs. Jalin Turner\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The sixth edition of the World Baseball Classic will be played in March 2026, three years after a thrilling 2023 finale between USA and Japan. That, of course, ended when Shohei Ohtani struck out then-Angels teammate Mike Trout. It was the most captivating moment of the baseball season, MLB postseason included. Hopefully we're in for more of the same next spring. The WBC expanded to 20 teams last time and the top four finishers in the four 2023 pools received an automatic berth into the 2026 WBC. Those 16 teams are Australia, Canada, Cuba, Czechia, Dominican Republic, Great Britain, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Panama, Puerto Rico, South Korea, United States, and Venezuela. Brazil, Chinese Taipei, Colombia, and Nicaragua earned the final four berths in qualifying tournaments during spring training 2025. The pools for the 2026 WBC were finalized in April, with the U.S. in the same bracket as Mexico, Italy, Great Britain, and Brazil. The tournament opens with Pool C (Tokyo) on March 5. Pool A (Puerto Rico), Pool B (Houston), and Pool D (Miami) begin play the next day. The Championship Game is scheduled for Tuesday, March 17, at loanDepot Park in Miami, the same venue that hosted the 2023 WBC Championship Game. Long-time big leaguer and current MLB Network analyst Mark DeRosa will return as Team USA's manager.\"Getting the chance to share the clubhouse and dugout with USA's  greatest staff and players was one of the highlights of my life,\" DeRosa said in April. \"I'm extremely grateful and fired up to get another opportunity  to put USA across my chest come March.\" \nJapan went 7-0 and outscored their opponents 56-18 in their seven games en route to their third WBC title in 2023 (they also won in 2006 and 2009). The Dominican Republic won the 2013 WBC and USA won the 2017 tournament. Here now are the players who have already committed to suiting up for USA  in the 2026 WBC. The roster is subject to change right up until it is  announced officially.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     OF Aaron Judge, Yankees Judge, the reigning two-time American League MVP, was announced as USA's captain and the first player to commit to the club back in April. It will be his first time playing in the WBC. \"I wanted to be there (in 2023). I was looking forward to this opportunity  again,\" the Yankees slugger said, noting he skipped the 2023 WBC because he had just been named New York's captain and wanted to focus on that. This past season, Judge slugged 53 home runs and led baseball in batting average (.331), on-base percentage (.457), slugging percentage (.688), and WAR (9.7). \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     SP Paul Skenes, Pirates USA will have the reigning AL MVP in the lineup and the reigning National League Cy Young atop the rotation. Skenes, who pitched for Air Force before transferring to LSU, committed to USA in May. \"If I ever get the chance to do this, I'm never saying no,\" he said. With all due respect to Jake Peavy and Roger Clemens, who was nearing the end of his career in 2006, Skenes very well might be the best pitcher to ever suit up for USA in the WBC. He had a 1.97 ERA with 216 strikeouts in 187 ⅔ innings this season, and joined Doc Gooden as the only pitchers in history to win Rookie of the Year one year and Cy Young the next. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     SS Bobby Witt Jr., Royals Bobby Baseball is returning to the WBC. Witt committed to USA in June and figures to their starting shortstop this time around. He was on the 2023 roster and was used primarily as a pinch-runner, going 1 for 2 with a double in his five appearances. \"It's a blast. These are the things you dream  of,\" Witt said about the 2023 WBC. Back then, he was heading into his sophomore season. This time around, Witt is a fully formed superstar. He authored a .295/.351/.501 slash line with 23 homers, 38 steals, and a league-leading 47 doubles in 2025. Witt finished fourth in the AL MVP voting and won his second straight Gold Glove. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     C Cal Raleigh, Mariners USA will have a 60-homer man behind the plate next spring. Raleigh set a new single-season home run record for a catcher and a switch-hitter in 2025, and was the runner-up to Judge for AL MVP. It will be his first WBC experience. \"I'm  just very honored that they would pick me and I'm  really looking forward to hopefully creating a memory and winning gold,\" Raleigh said in July. He led MLB in homers (60) and RBI (125) this past season while slashing .247/.359/.589 and playing excellent defense at the game's most demanding position.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     OF Pete Crow-Armstrong, Cubs Fresh off a 30-30 season, Crow-Armstrong and his Gold Glove defense will roam center field for USA in the WBC. His commitment to the event was confirmed in November. \"I love playing for my country more than anything,\" Crow-Armstrong said. PCA was a 6.0 WAR player in 2025 thanks to top of the line defense as well as his 31 homers and 35 steals. He joined Sammy Sosa as the only players in Cubs' history to go 30-30 and finished ninth in the NL MVP voting. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     OF Corbin Carroll, Diamondbacks USA's outfield will feature three All-Stars and three top-9 finishers in the MVP voting. Carroll will join Crow-Armstrong and Judge on the roster, he announced in November. \"It was not a hard decision. I couldn't be more excited. It's going to be awesome,\" Carroll said. He led the league in triples for the third year in a row in 2025, and hit .259/.343/.541 with 31 home runs and 32 steals. It was Carroll's first 30-30 season. He was an All-Star for the second time and he finished sixth in the NL MVP voting, his second time finishing that high (fifth in 2023). \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     RP Garrett Whitlock, Red Sox One of the game's top right-handed relievers will be in USA's bullpen. Whitlock announced his commitment to USA on social media in November. It will be his first time playing in the tournament. After battling injuries and bouncing between the rotation and bullpen from 2022-24, Whitlock became a full-time reliever in 2025 and threw 72 innings with a 2.25 ERA and 91 strikeouts. He frequently worked multiple innings, which will come in handy in the early rounds of the WBC, when pitchers are held to strict pitch limits. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    SP Matthew Boyd, CubsAfter battling injury and inconsistency for the first decade of his MLB career, Boyd busted out with his first All-Star berth in 2025 at age 34. He announced Wednesday on Foul Territory that he'll be on Team USA for the WBC in 2026. Boyd returned from Tommy John surgery in 2024 with the Guardians and pitched to a 2.72 ERA in eight starts. It was good enough to earn a two-year, $29 million deal with an option for 2027 from the Cubs. In 2025, he went 14-8 with a 3.21 ERA and 154 strikeouts in 179 ⅔ innings. Upon his announcement, Boyd became the first left-handed pitcher on Team USA for this cycle and it seems pretty likely he'll be in the rotation for the event.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Ole Miss will learn its first-round College Football Playoff matchup on Sunday while former coach Lane Kiffin watches on from Baton Rouge. Kiffin, now the coach at LSU, wanted to stay with the Rebels through the CFP run before completely departing, but Ole Miss informed him that wouldn't be an option and is moving forward with former defensive coordinator Pete Golding as its new head coach -- not just in the interim but long-term. \n        \n            \n                Inside the weeks of turmoil that drove Lane Kiffin from Ole Miss to LSU -- with a hard pass on Florida\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nKiffin offered some frustrated complaints about that decision by Ole Miss on his way out the door, first in his letter announcing he was going to LSU and then later in his opening press conference in Baton Rouge. Kiffin claimed the players wanted him to coach the team in the playoff and that he didn't find out until Sunday morning (the day he went public with his decision) that he wouldn't be permitted to do so. Ole Miss athletic director Keith Carter, during a Wednesday interview with Supertalk Mississippi, offered a calm, but searing rebuttal of Kiffin's recent run of comments. Carter said Kiffin was made aware \"several weeks ago\" that he would not be able to coach Ole Miss in the postseason if he accepted another job. \"Yeah, there's been a lot of things he's said publicly that I'm not sure are totally accurate,\" Carter said with a smirk. \"I think that both coach and his representation knew several weeks ago that coaching in the playoffs was not gonna be an option if he was not the Ole Miss head coach.\"\nKiffin claimed he was not made aware that he would not be allowed to coach in the playoff until 8:30 Sunday morning. Carter offered another version of events. \"No, that's not accurate. That's not accurate. The only thing that was a little bit of a wrinkle in it was if Auburn had beaten Alabama, we were gonna play in the SEC Championship,\" Carter said. \"That threw a little wrinkle in it -- not to say he would've coached in that game -- but with the shorter time period that was maybe the only little nuance to it. But absolutely, it was very clear that coaching in the postseason was not going to be an option for Coach Kiffin a few weeks ago.\" Carter's comments align with reports that came out of Oxford in the final weeks of Kiffin's tenure. While it makes sense for Ole Miss to forbid Kiffin from coaching the Rebels on his way out (while potentially actively recruiting Ole Miss players to join him at LSU in the process), the refusal to allow him to coach in the College Football Playoff also served as the school's best leverage point in trying to keep him in Oxford. \nThat didn't work out and Kiffin left the program with hurt feelings all the way around, which comes as little surprise given his history of messy departures. The war of words between the two sides -- albeit a very Southern one with a decidedly \"bless his heart\" tone from Carter and Ole Miss -- in the aftermath was to be expected. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The stage is set for the FIFA World Cup draw, which will take place on December 5 at the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C. as FIFA has released the final pots for the 48 teams taking part in the World Cup. These pots are based on the FIFA men's world rankings, with the three host countries, the United States, Canada, and Mexico, being joined in pot one by the nine next highest ranked teams in those rankings. They're then followed by the next 12 highest-ranked teams making up pot two, pot three, and so on, until pot four includes the playoff winners from both the UEFA playoff path and the inter-confederation playoffs. Following the draw, the match calendar and stadiums for the World Cup will be released on Saturday, December 6.To balance the draw, the top four teams in the FIFA ranking will be drawn with constraints to keep them separate until the semifinals. Spain, Argentina, France, and England are the teams occupying those slots, and it will see Spain and Argentina drawn into separate pathways so they cannot meet before the final, with the same principle then being applied to France and England.FIFA World Cup potsThe official pots are as follows:Pot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium,GermanyPot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, IR Iran, Korea Republic,Ecuador, Austria, AustraliaPot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar,Saudi Arabia, South AfricaPot 4: Jordan, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, European Play-Off A, B, C and D, FIFA, Play-Off Tournament 1 and 2Looking at the pots, there is the potential for some loaded groups, such as the United States getting Morocco, Norway, and Ghana in the same group or Brazil, Japan, Egypt, and Italy (if they make it out of the European playoff) making up a group. Despite the expansion to 48 teams for the 2026 World Cup, there will be some balanced and difficult groups.Draw restrictionsNo group will have more than one team from the same federation in it, except UEFA, which is required to have two groups of two UEFA teams in it due to the fact that 16 teams will be participating in the tournament. For the playoff tournament teams, the confederation restrictions will be applied to all teams involved in the playoff, which would keep the host nations from drawing a team involved in the FIFA playoff tournament due to Jamaica and Suriname being involved as Concacaf teams.When are the playoffs?All playoffs will take place during the March international break in 2026. The UEFA playoffs are scheduled from Thursday, March 26, with the finals on March 31. The inter-confederation playoffs will take place in Mexico, being split between the Estadio Akron in Guadalajara and the Estadio BBVA in Monterrey, taking place between March 23-31. By the end of March, all 48 teams will be determined and placed in groups.Inter-confederation playoffs drawPATH 1Semifinal: New Caledonia vs. Jamaica Final: Congo DR vs. New Caledonia/Jamaica PATH 2Semifinal: Bolivia vs. SurinameFinal: Iraq vs. Bolivia/SurinameEuropean playoffs drawPATH ASemifinal: Italy vs. Northern Ireland Semifinal: Wales vs. Bosnia and Herzegovina Final: Wales/Bosnia vs. Italy/Northern Ireland \nPATH B Semifinal: Ukraine vs. Sweden Semifinal: Poland vs. Albania Final: Ukraine/Sweden vs. Poland/AlbaniaPATH CSemifinal: Turkiye vs. Romania Semifinal: Slovakia vs. Kosovo Final: Slovakia/Kosovo vs. Turkiye/Romania PATH DSemifinal: Denmark vs. North Macedonia Semifinal: Czechia vs. Republic of Ireland Final: Czechia/Republic of Ireland vs. Denmark/North Macedonia How the World Cup worksIn 2023, it was announced that the 2026 World Cup would be expanded to 48 teams from the previous 32. Divided into 12 groups of four teams each, the expansion will also create a new knockout round that will take place after the group stage, which is now a round of 32 teams. TO make up that 32, the top two teams from each group and the eight best third-placed teams will all advance with a chance at making the round of 16.From there, things will proceed as normal with the quarterfinals, semifinals, and the final as Argentina will look to defend their World Cup title from the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\nHow World Cup slots are decidedThe European confederation (UEFA) is guaranteed 16 slots of the 48 teams, while the African confederation (CAF) has nine, and the Asian confederation (AFC) has eight. There will also be a minimum of six each from South America (CONMEBOL) and the Confederation of North, Central America, and Caribbean Association Football (Concacaf). On top of this, for the first time in history, the Oceania Football Confederation (OFC) has one guaranteed slot, while the remaining two spots will be decided through intercontinental playoffs.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        It's a tale as old as (football) time: a wide receiver and a quarterback getting in a heated debate on the sideline during a game. The latest example came during the Cleveland Browns' 26-8 loss to the San Francisco 49ers.During the fourth quarter on Sunday, wide receiver Jerry Jeudy was seen clapping his hands as he and rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders, who was holding a tablet, discussed something on the sideline. Sanders then got up and appeared to shake his head as their conversation continued.Asked about the situation Wednesday, both said it was no big deal.\"We resolved that. We're not going to speak on that,\" Sanders said. Jeudy said the exchange was about a particular play from the game and the two have since moved on. \"We spoke about it. We're good,\" Jeudy said. \"It's an emotional sport. Things like that happen. It's football.\"\n\n\nIn retrospect, Jeudy said he and Sanders \"probably\" could have spoken away from the camera. \"That's probably what I would have done differently,\" Jeudy said. \"I'm going to speak my mind and say what I see out there, but it is what it is. It's football. Me and Shedeur good. Stuff like that happens.\"Browns coach Kevin Stefanski said the situation was handled internally.\"Football is an emotional sport and certainly when you're a family like we are, you can have your disagreements. Sometimes they're for everybody to see. Sometimes it's behind closed doors. But like a family, we move on, we talk about it, so not worried about it,\" Stefanski said.Jeudy had three receptions for 26 yards as the Browns fell to 3-9. Jeudy set career highs in receptions (90) and receiving yards (1,229) in 2024, but has struggled this season. He has just 35 catches for 421 yards and one touchdown this season as the Browns have had a revolving door at quarterback. \nSanders, a rookie fifth-round pick out of Colorado, is the third QB to start for Cleveland this season. He started the season behind veteran Joe Flacco leaving and rookie third-round pick Dillon Gabriel. But after Flacco was traded and Gabriel was sidelined by a concussion, Sanders was given an opportunity and is set to make his third start of the season Sunday when the Browns host the Tennessee Titans. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Devin Williams is changing boroughs. Williams and the New York Mets have agreed to a three-year contract, the team announced Wednesday. The deal includes $45 million in salary plus a $6 million signing bonus and deferrals, according to the New York Post.The signing reunites Williams with David Stearns. Williams was a minor leaguer with the Milwaukee Brewers when the club named Stearns their general manager in September 2015, and the two overlapped in the organization until Stearns left to take over the Mets two years ago. Surely that relationship played a role in the signing.Williams, 31, spent this past season across town with the Yankees and had a turbulent season, throwing 62 innings with a 4.79 ERA. He allowed 37 runs in 2025 after allowing 33 runs combined from 2022-24. Williams was dominant at times, however, and he finished the season with 90 strikeouts in those 62 innings. He was a trusted late-inning reliever in the postseason. \n\"At first it was a challenge, but I've grown to love being here,\" Williams said after the Yankees were eliminated from the postseason. \"I love this city. I love taking the train to the field every day.\" We ranked Williams as the 19th-best free agent available this offseason, and the second best reliever behind erstwhile Mets closer Edwin Díaz. Here's the write-up: \n\"High-Lev Dev\" is a strong rebound candidate based on, if nothing  else, the incongruity between his ERA and his underlying data. There  were 21 pitchers who made 30 or more appearances in 2025 without any  starts and who possessed a strikeout rate above 30% and a walk rate  below 10%. Williams' 4.79 ERA was the worst of the group, which as a  whole put up a 2.76 mark -- to the extent that the next worst ERA was  just over 4.00. Williams somehow managed that while sporting the fourth-best hard-hit percentage of the bunch, behind names like Josh Hader and Abner Uribe.  Things happen in this game sometimes, particularly with individual  relief seasons. There's no compelling reason to think Williams has lost  his touch just yet. \tWe explained further why Williams, despite his disappointing season with the Yankees, was a highly coveted free agent with a chance to bounce back to his All-Star form. The Williams signing does not necessarily preclude Díaz returning to the Mets, though it does make it less likely. New York's bullpen was in rough shape most of the 2025 season and it could be that they hope to pair Williams with Díaz rather than have Williams replace Díaz. Either way, Williams figures to be the first reliever the Mets acquire this winter, not the only one. Lefties Brooks Raley and A.J. Minter are the only other locks for New York's bullpen at the moment. Minter missed most of this past season with season-ending lat surgery. Righty Huascar Brazoban is a candidate for another bullpen spot.  \nThe Yankees did not make Williams the $22.025 million qualifying offer, so they will not receive a compensation draft pick for losing him nor will the Mets surrender draft picks to sign him. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The first conference title game of the 2025 college football season features Kennesaw State and Jacksonville State squaring off for the Conference USA crown. It's a rematch of last month's meeting, which Jacksonville State won 35-26.In Year 2 as an FBS member, Kennesaw State will be playing for its first CUSA title. The Owls finished the 2024 campaign at 2-10 and have staged a remarkable turnaround under first-year coach Jerry Mack. They enter the game 9-3 and went 7-1 in conference play.Jacksonville State also finished 7-1 in league play and will host the title game. The Gamecocks are seeking their second straight CUSA championship after beating Western Kentucky 52-12 in last year's title game. With a win over Kennesaw State, Jacksonville State would become the fourth program to claim back-to-back CUSA crowns. Kennesaw State vs. Jacksonville State: Need to know Homefield advantage for Jacksonville State: The Gamecocks have won 11 straight at home, with their last loss at AmFirst Stadium coming against Coastal Carolina in the 2024 season opener. This season's 5-0 home record includes their win over Kennesaw State. This will be the seventh all-time meeting between the programs, and the stakes have never been higher.Kennesaw State's turnaround: No FBS program has made a bigger leap in 2025 than Kennesaw State. The Owls improved their win total by seven and are on the verge of claiming a conference title in just their second season at the FBS level. They can become only the second program to win a league championship game in Year 2 after reclassifying from FCS -- joining Jacksonville State, which did it last year.\nCam Cook is the X-factor: Jacksonville State's star running back could determine this game. Cook enters averaging 131.8 rushing yards per game, the top mark in the FBS. He's totaled 1,581 yards, has topped 100 yards in seven straight games and has 10 100-yard performances overall — the most in the country. He ran for 132 yards and a touchdown in the first meeting with Kennesaw State.

The Gamecocks have home-field advantage and a strong run game that should help them control this one. My prediction is Jacksonville State wins the CUSA title game behind a big night on the ground from Cook. PICK: Jacksonville State -1.5 \n\n                    \n    \n

    "body": "\n        We're only a few days from the Winter Meetings and we've started to see a trickle of moves here in the MLB offseason, which means it's possible things start to pick up a bit. As such, the rumor mill is churning and we're going to round up the best nuggets of news and rumors here for the day, which is Wednesday, Dec. 3. Let's get to it.Dodgers bring back RojasThe world-champion Los Angeles Dodgers have agreed to terms with infielder Miguel Rojas on a one-year, $5.5 million pact, El Extrabase reports. After the 2026 season, Rojas plans to retire and work in a player-development role for the Dodgers. Earlier in the offseason, CBS Sports ranked Rojas as the No. 42 available free agent in the current class. Here's part of RJ Anderson's write-up: Rojas will celebrate his 36th birthday in the spring and he hasn't started more than 100 games in either of the past two seasons. In an ideal world, he would continue to serve as a team's third middle infielder; in this one, he might land a starting role. Rojas remains a plus defender with experience at each of the \"skilled\" infield spots. His offensive game continues to tilt toward contact, but his overall output has improved since he arrived in Los Angeles and learned to pull the ball more frequently. It would be a mistake to assume his topline results will maintain with more exposure. At the same time, it's not as though this class offers much in the way of reliable alternatives.Rojas is coming off a 2025 campaign in which he slashed .262/.318/.397 with seven home runs and a WAR of 2.1 in 114 games for the Dodgers while spending time at every infield position. He also famously hit a game-tying home run in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 7 of the World Series and made a game-ending double play to clinch the title.Reds re-up with PagánThe Reds have re-signed right-hander Emilio Pagán to a two-year, $20 million contract that will cover the 2026 and 2027 seasons, the Athletic reports. Pagán ranks 37th on CBS Sports' list of the top 50 free agents of the current offseason. Here's part of our write-up: \nAll relievers are volatile, but Pagán is an extreme case. He's highly dependent on fly-ball contact, to the point where last season represented the fourth time in his career that his batted-ball profile has included more than 70% fly balls and line drives. Pagán nevertheless managed the second best ERA+ of his career by generating an extreme amount of swing and misses on his three-pitch arsenal: both up on his fastball and beneath on his splitter and cutter. There are teams in certain ballparks who just shouldn't bother; a team with a spacious field, though, could slot him right into the ninth.Pagán, 34, worked 68 ⅔ innings for Cincy last season, and over that span he pitched to a 2.88 ERA with 81 strikeouts. Rays sign MullinsThe Tampa Bay Rays have agreed to terms with veteran outfielder and free agent Cedric Mullins on a one-year contract pending the results of a physical, the Tampa Bays Times reports. The deal is worth a reported $7 million. \nEarlier in the offseason, CBS Sports ranked Mullins as the No. 41 available free agent in the class of 2025-26. Here's part off RJ Anderson's write-up: Mullins' play went into the tank after a deadline trade to the Mets. The concerns here are bigger than 40-odd games, though, and have to do with an offensive profile that works best in only a handful of parks. He was able to carve out a career as a league-average hitter (for the most part) behind a lift-and-pull approach that saw him slug more than expected. In turn, Mullins has steadily run a high pop-up rate. When his strikeout rate spiked last season, all the way up to a career-worst 24.1%, he found himself making too many automatic outs to counterbalance. Mullins might be able to make the math work again if he signs with a club with generous right-field dimensions. In a combined 133 games for the Orioles and Mets in 2025, Mullins had an OPS+ of 94, and he showed declining defense in center field. He's going into his age-31 season in 2026. \nBrewers drawing 'significant interest' in PeraltaEarlier this offseason, reports surfaced that the Brewers were not interested in trading ace Freddy Peralta. In fact, as recently as yesterday the reporting was that the Brewers were going to keep him.Lately, though, according to The Athletic, things might be leaning in the other direction.Perhaps this was inevitable, but the interest in right-hander Freddy Peralta is so significant, the Milwaukee Brewers are now considering \"cracking the door open\" for trade discussions, according to a person briefed on their situation.Peralta is 30 years old next season and is coming off arguably the best year of his career. He was 17-6 with a 2.70 ERA (154 ERA+), 1.08 WHIP, 204 strikeouts in 176 ⅔ innings. He posted a career-high 5.5 WAR. He's set to make $8 million in 2026 before hitting free agency. If the Brewers think 2025 was the peak for Peralta and that he'll definitely walk in free agency, you can see the line of thinking to accept huge trade offers here. They previously dealt Corbin Burnes a season before free agency. Given the conflicting reports of late, it's safe to assume the situation is fluid with the Brewers listening to trade offers and maybe even considering them while leaning toward keeping Peralta until they're blown away.\nMariners weighing infield optionsThe Mariners are looking for some infield help as they head to the Winter Meetings. From the team that made it all the way to Game 7 of the ALCS this past season, second baseman Jorge Polanco and third baseman Eugenio Suárez are both free agents. They already brought back first baseman Josh Naylor on a five-year, $92.5 million deal. Polanco is the \"top target\" for the Mariners, according to the Seattle Times. While the interest is mutual, the two sides, at this point, are reportedly not \"close to a deal.\" The Red Sox, Yankees and Pirates are mentioned as other possible suitors for Polanco.The Mariners have \"kept the door open\" regarding a reunion with Suárez, too, according to the Times.As far as any interest the Mariners have in players outside the organization, they have repotedly \"expressed interest\" in Cardinals utility man Brendan Donovan. He's under control by the Cardinals, so this would be a trade for Donovan to take over at second base in the event the Mariners can't come to a deal with Polanco.\nAstros looking at pitching depthThe Astros were crushed under the weight of pitching injuries over the last two years, including lengthy absences from the likes of Cristian Javier, Lance McCullers Jr., Luis Garcia, Ronel Blanco and Spencer Arrighetti. What's more, ace workhorse Framber Valdez is now a free agent. Knowing all this, it isn't surprising that the Astros are targeting depth at the Winter Meetings. They don't \"have the financial resources\" to a top free agent, per MLB.com, but they have a \"desire\" to land pitchers who are still under team control via trades. Center fielder Jake Meyers is mentioned as a possibility for the Astros to trade for said pitching. Marlins not inclined to deal Alcantara or Cabrera?People love talking about trading prospects to the Marlins in order to grab controllable players because, well, look at their history. This time around, the Marlins are apparently trying to hold and maybe even extend some of their own players, according to MLB.com.\nSpecifically, high-upside Edward Cabrera and former Cy Young winner Sandy Alcantara have seen their names bandied about in trade rumors since early last regular season, but the Marlins are repotedly not \"actively trying to trade\" either, though if that were to change, Christina De Nicola speculated that Cabrera is the more likely of the two to be dealt. Blue Jays willing to deal BerríosThe Blue Jays have signed starting pitchers Dylan Cease and Cody Ponce so far this offseason. Given that they have Kevin Gausman and Shane Bieber coming back in addition to rookie sensation Trey Yesavage, that's a full, five-man rotation without getting to veteran and former All-Star José Berríos. Sure enough, they are willing to part with Berríos in a trade, according to The Athletic. Berríos, 31, was 9-5 with a 4.17 ERA (102 ERA+), 1.30 WHIP and 138 strikeouts in 166 innings along with 1.3 WAR last season. Keep in mind that he's due over $18 million this season before roughly $24 million in each 2027 and 2028. In light of their recent signings and trying to bring back Bo Bichette, it's possible the Jays are trying to shed salary in dealing Berríos. \nObviously, teams these days need more than five starting pitchers, but the Jays already have depth beyond their starting five with Eric Lauer and Bowden Francis.Former GM Byrnes takes Rockies' GM positionFormer Diamondbacks and Padres general manager Josh Byrnes has been hired as the general manager of the Rockies, the team announced Wednesday. Keep in mind that there's been a shift in titles over the course of the past decade-plus and that GM isn't necessarily always the big boss in the front office. Here, Byrnes is second in command under new president of baseball operations Paul DePodesta. \n            ",

Right-hander Dylan Cease agreed to a seven-year, $210 million deal with the Blue Jays on Thanksgiving Eve. It's tied for the fourth-largest deal in terms of total money among active pitchers, and is a big boost for the reigning AL champs. While there's no Aaron Judge or Juan Soto on the market this winter, there's plenty of top talent still available. Kyle Tucker, a four-time All-Star who will turn 29 in January, leads the list, and though his second half left much to be desired, he could be a huge asset for any team. Alex Bregman was left on the market until late last winter but he showed no ill effects, putting up a 128 OPS+. On the pitching side, Framber Valdez and Ranger Suárez could frontline almost any rotation.Josh Naylor became the first notable hitter to ink a new deal this offseason, heading back to Seattle in the winter's first major free agency deal. He's re-signing with the Mariners on a five-year, $92.5 million deal.

Not one of them has done what Dvalishvili gets the shot to do. The UFC bantamweight champion has successfully defended his title against Umnar Nurmagomedov, Sean O'Malley and Cory Sandhagen in 2025. Should Dvalishvili overcome Yan, who he previously beat in 2023, \"The Machine\" will hold a record uniquely his own. Against Yan, Dvalishvili faces a former champion finding his second wind after ripping off three straight wins.A second title fight supports UFC 323. Alexandre Pantoja is building a strong case for being the second-best flyweight champion in UFC history, behind only Mount Rushmore fighter Demetrious \"Mighty Mouse\" Johnson. His next challenger is compelling. Joshua Van burst onto the scene, going from UFC debutant to title challenger in two years. Like Dvalishvili, he fights for the fourth time this year in pursuit of becoming a UFC champion.\n        \n            \n                UFC 324: Justin Gaethje vs. Paddy Pimblett, Kayla Harrison vs. Amanda Nunes to headline Paramount+ debut card\n                \n                    Shakiel Mahjouri                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe undercard also features some veterans looking to get back to the title level.

He's a borderline starter at best in the majority of leagues.Nix has scored 18.4 Fantasy points or less in three games in a row, including a 7.8-point dud in Week 10 against the Raiders at home. He's also scored more than 20 Fantasy points just twice in six road games this season.Now, he did score 23.4 Fantasy points at Las Vegas in his rookie season in 2024. And he's scored at least 22.5 Fantasy points in two of three indoor road games this year.The Raiders have only allowed one quarterback to score more than 17.6 Fantasy points in their past four games, which was Dak Prescott in Week 11, and have limited Justin Herbert and Nix during that stretch. But I'm hopeful Nix will be more productive in the rematch.\nI have him ranked just outside the top 12, and his projected points on SportsLine of 21.6 is a little high but fair. I'm not counting on a huge game from Nix in Week 14, but hopefully he will perform well enough to be a low-end starter in all leagues.\nQBs to Start\n                        Projections powered by\n

Amon-Ra St. Brown (ankle) not expected to play, as well as Sam LaPorta (back) on injured reserve. But I still like Goff as a top-10 Fantasy quarterback in this potential shootout with Dallas at home. Only one quarterback this season has failed to score at least 23.7 Fantasy points against the Cowboys, which was Geno Smith in Week 11, and Dallas is No. 1 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing quarterbacks. Goff has scored at least 21.2 Fantasy points in three home games in a row, and he should be successful with Jameson Williams, Isaac TeSlaa and Jahmyr Gibbs out of the backfield.\n            \n

    \n                    \n                Burrow had a successful return in Week 13 at Baltimore from his nine-game absence with a toe injury with 24-of-46 passing for 261 yards and two touchdowns, and he scored 23.2 Fantasy points. He doesn't have an easy matchup in Week 14 at Buffalo, but I still like Burrow as a top-10 Fantasy quarterback. The Bills are No. 2 in fewest Fantasy points allowed to opposing quarterbacks, and only Lamar Jackson in Week 1 has scored more than 20 Fantasy points against this defense, including matchups with Drake Maye, Patrick Mahomes and Baker Mayfield. That said, this is more about having faith in Burrow, who should be throwing a lot. His player prop on FanDuel is 35.5 attempts, and in 13 games over the past two seasons with at least 36 attempts, he is averaging 29.8 Fantasy points, with only two games under 21.2 points over that

including Week 8 at New Orleans when he only scored 4.1 points. Four of those bad games were on the road, but Mayfield is averaging 22.3 Fantasy points at home this season. And prior to his dud against the Saints earlier this year, Mayfield scored at least 20.3 Fantasy points against New Orleans in four games in a row. Six quarterbacks this season have scored at least 21.5 Fantasy points against the Saints, and I'm counting on Mayfield to get back on track at home in this matchup.\n            \n            \n\n\n

now two poor outings in a row on the road after he scored 10.3 Fantasy points at Minnesota in Week 11. The Packers have held four of the past five quarterbacks to 14 Fantasy points or less, and Williams was held to 16.2 Fantasy points or less in each of his two games against Green Bay as a rookie in 2024. He's a better quarterback this season, but the Bears will likely lean on their ground game in this matchup. I would only start Williams in Superflex and two-quarterback leagues in Week 14.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        SEA\n                    \n                         \n                        Seattle\n                    \n                                            • #14\n                                            \n                                            Age: 28\n                                                                        • Experience: 8 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        ATL\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    SEA -7\n                                    O/U 44.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS QB\n                                \n                                16th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                17.5\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    QB RNK\n                                \n                                18th\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        PAYDS\n                                    \n                                    2913\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    49\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    19\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INT\n                                    \n                                    10\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    17.1\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Darnold hasn't gone rotten yet in reality, but he's struggling as a Fantasy quarterback heading into Week 14 at Atlanta. He's scored 6.9 Fantasy points or less in three of his past four games, and he has three touchdowns and eight turnovers (five interceptions) over that span. I'm not overly concerned about the matchup for Darnold, but it's more about his mistakes and potential lack of attempts. He's had more than 26 pass attempts just once since Week 7, and Seattle might not have to throw the ball much in this game to win. I would only start Darnold in Superflex and two-quarterback leagues in Week 14.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        MIA\n                    \n                         \n                        Miami\n                    \n                                            • #1\n                                            \n                                            Age: 27\n                                                                        • Experience: 6 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        NYJ\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    MIA -2.5\n                                    O/U 41.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS QB\n                                \n                                20th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                14.7\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    QB RNK\n                                \n                                23rd\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        PAYDS\n                                    \n                                    2280\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    42\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    17\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INT\n                                    \n                                    14\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    14.1\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Prior to Week 11, I was planning to use Tagovailoa in several leagues as a potential sleeper given his schedule to close the season against Washington, New Orleans, the Jets, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati and Tampa Bay. Those are all plus matchups, but Tagovailoa has already had disappointing Fantasy outings against the Commanders (6.8 points) and Saints (4.7), which makes him tough to trust against the Jets. He's actually scored 14.8 Fantasy points or less in four games in a row and in six of his past seven outings, and the Jets have held three quarterbacks in a row to 17.4 Fantasy points or less, including matchups with Drake Maye and Lamar Jackson. Part of the reason for Tagovailoa's lowly stats is how well De'Von Achane is running the ball, and I expect Miami to continue to lean on Achane in this matchup. Tagovailoa is only worth using in Superflex and two-quarterback leagues in Week 14.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        HOU\n                    \n                         \n                        Houston\n                    \n                                            • #7\n                                            \n                                            Age: 24\n                                                                        • Experience: 3 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        KC\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    KC -3.5\n                                    O/U 41.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS QB\n                                \n                                14th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                15.5\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    QB RNK\n                                \n                                20th\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        PAYDS\n                                    \n                                    1978\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    189\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    11\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INT\n                                    \n                                    6\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    16.8\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Stroud returned from his three-game absence with a concussion in Week 13 at Indianapolis and only scored 9.1 Fantasy points. It will be tough to trust him in one-quarterback leagues at Kansas City, and Stroud has scored 15.7 Fantasy points or less in four of five road starts this season. Now, Stroud did score 20.1 Fantasy points at the Chiefs in 2024 in Week 16, and Kansas City has allowed Daniel Jones and Dak Prescott to each score at least 20.8 Fantasy points in the past two games. But I'm not counting on Stroud to have a big performance Sunday night, and I would only start him in Superflex and two-quarterback leagues.\n            \n            \n\nBust Alert (Start/Sit)\n                        Projections powered by\n                        \n                            Sportsline\n                        \n                    \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        LAC\n                    \n                         \n                        L.A.

If that doesn't make you nervous, consider that Herbert has scored 16.8 Fantasy points or less in three games in a row. Now, factor in that he's facing the Eagles, who have held Jordan Love, Jared Goff and Caleb Williams to 14.1 Fantasy points or less in three of the past four games. The offensive line for the Chargers is a mess, and Herbert has been sacked 16 times in his past four games. This has the potential to be ugly for Herbert, and he's only worth starting in Superflex and two-quarterback leagues in Week 14.\n            \n            \n\n            \n    \n\n        \n\n    \n

    "body": "\n        Philadelphia Eagles offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo's New Jersey home was pelted with eggs hours after Philadelphia's Week 13 loss to the Chicago Bears, according to police. A video on social media shows multiple people throwing objects at Patullo's home. The video includes audio of someone telling Patullo to \"get the f--- out of Philly.\" The Moorestown Police Department has stated that the investigation is ongoing.Patullo's home was vandalized following another tough outing for the offense -- scoring just 15 points while committing two turnovers while Saquon Barkley carried the ball just 13 times for 56 yards. Several days removed from the incident, Patullo, a first-year coordinator, told reporters that criticism comes with the territory of a high-profile job but anything involving a coach's family \"crosses the line.\"\"Unfortunately, it happened,\" Patullo said Wednesday. \"I've been here for five years now, and it's been awesome. This is such a unique place to coach and play. It's very special. We've been to two NFC Championship games. We've won at Lincoln Financial, a Super Bowl, the parade. It's an amazing atmosphere to be a coach and a player. And as coaches and players, we all know that part of our job is to handle criticism. It's perfectly acceptable to sit up here and talk about what's going on, how to fix it, what we're going to do going forward, and we know that. But when it involves your family, it obviously crosses the line. That happened, and at this point, we've just gotta move on.\"\n\n        \n            \n                Prisco's Week 14 NFL picks: Packers cool off Bears in NFC North showdown, Cowboys keep rolling vs. Lions\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThrough 12 games, the Eagles' offense is 19th in the NFL in scoring, 23rd in passing, 22nd in rushing and 28th in third down efficiency. Philadelphia is getting it done in the red zone, however, as it is currently tops in the NFL with a 75.9% touchdown rate. While he said that he will evaluate everything following the loss to Chicago, Eagles coach Nick Sirianni is sticking with Patullo as his offensive play-caller. Patullo, 44, has been on Sirianni's staff since he took over back in 2021. Patullo previously served as the team's pass game coordinator. He was promoted to offensive coordinator when Kellen Moore left to coach the New Orleans Saints. \"I have confidence in the entire group,\" Sirianni said. \"I know it will keep coming back to Kevin. If I thought it was one thing, I'd make those changes. Obviously, it's a lot of different things. I don't think it's Kevin.\"\nDespite their offensive struggles, the Eagles will head into their Week 14 with the Los Angeles Chargers with an 8-4 record and in first place in the NFC East. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The College Football Playoff selection committee made a move that raised some eyebrows in its penultimate rankings by swapping Alabama and Notre Dame for the No. 9 and No. 10 spots, respectively. The Fighting Irish, despite walloping rival Stanford 49-20, slipped behind the Crimson Tide in a changing of places that left coach Marcus Freeman puzzled.Alabama won a rivalry game of its own but was not nearly as dominant in a 27-20 Iron Bowl victory over Auburn. The Crimson Tide won by a smaller margin than the Fighting Irish, and its caliber of opponent only marginally better than Auburn, which finished the regular season with just one more win than Stanford. How was that enough for the committee to be convinced that Alabama deserved a higher ranking than Notre Dame? That is the question Freeman is left pondering.\"Obviously you're disappointed, but more so because of a little bit of confusion,\" Freeman said Wednesday. \"You're confused in terms of what we could have done differently and why we fell when we won 49-20. I think we were up 42-6 going into the fourth quarter. I don't spend time talking about other teams, but it's just like, OK, what could we have done differently? I don't know.\"\n        \n            \n                A College Football Playoff bracket without Alabama, Notre Dame or any ACC team? How this scenario could happen\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAt surface level, a one-spot difference in the top 25 is hardly sizable. But given where Notre Dame and Alabama stand in the race for inclusion in the 12-team playoff bracket, one spot could be the margin between competing for a national championship and watching the CFP from home.\n\"You always look for cause and effect,\" Freeman said. \"You look for a reasoning why you go up or you fall. For me, you didn't see a great explanation for why we fell when we had the performance we did last Saturday.\"If the favorites in this weekend's conference championship games win, Notre Dame will be in position to hold the final at-large spot in the bracket. But if No. 11 BYU defeats No. 4 Texas Tech in the Big 12 Championship Game and becomes a \"bid stealer\" of sorts, the Fighting Irish would likely be the team bounced from the projected bracket.CFP committee chair explains controversial rankingsArkansas athletic director Hunter Yurachek, who stepped into the CFP selection committee chair position last month, offered an explanation for the swap at the No. 9 and No. 10 spots. Now in his second year on the committee, Yurachek said the debate in the room between Notre Dame and Alabama over the last three weeks has been among the strongest he has witnessed during his CFP service.\n\"I think this week, as we looked at those two teams and how closely they have been over the past three weeks -- Notre Dame went on the road and had a strong win at Stanford, but Alabama went on the road in a rivalry game, looked really good,\" Yurachek said on Tuesday's rankings show. \"I think that was enough to change the minds of a couple of committee members to push Alabama up ahead of Notre Dame in this week's rankings.\"\n        \n            \n                College Football Playoff bracket: What 12-team field looks like after fifth CFP Rankings released\n                \n                    Will Backus                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nOne possible explanation for Alabama's climb to No. 9 is that the committee may have sought to protect the Crimson Tide from falling out of the bracket in the event it loses to No. 3 Georgia the SEC Championship Game. The committee set a precedent in previous years that it wishes not to punish title game losers for falling short in a 13th data point.Yurachek, however, said that was not a consideration for this week's rankings and instead would be discussed after the championship games are complete.\n            ",

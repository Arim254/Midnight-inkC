    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \nBarcelona face Osasuna on Saturday in a crucial LaLiga match that can extend their lead atop the standings. The team coached by Hansi Flick in the past weeks has bounced back from being five points behind Real Madrid in the league to building a four edge on their closest rival, thanks to a combination of strong play on their part and also the negative form of Xabi Alonso's team. The German coach spoke ahead of the game on Friday and said: \"We have to focus on ourselves. Not on Real Madrid. These are three very important points. The quality of training now is much better than it was two months ago. If we train at this level, we will improve.\" That said, it's hard to imagine Barcelona's form doesn't have some impact on the current crisis at Real Madrid, where after a strong start, Spain's other big giant are considering firing their manager. Although he's set to remain on the sidelines this weekend, Alonso's position with Real Madrid is very much a week-to-week proposition as 2025 draws to an end. A win from Barcelona is a crucial part of keeping the pressure on, and ensuring that their rivals, even if they should take all three points this weekend, remain in an uncertain and precarious position.Here's what you need to know about Saturday's match.  How to watch Barcelona vs. Osasuna, oddsDate: Saturday, Dec. 13 | Time: 12 p.m. ETLocation: Spotify Camp Nou -- BarcelonaLive stream: ESPN+Odds: Barcelona -485; Draw +613; Osasuna +1013Possible lineupsBarcelona XI: Joan Garcia; Jules Kounde, Pau Cubarsi, Gerard Martin, Alejandro Balde; Eric Garcia, Pedri; Lamine Yamal, Raphinha, Marcus Rashford; Ferran Torres.Osasuna XI: Sergio Herrera; Valentin Rosier, Alejandro Catena, Flavien Boyomo, Abel Bretones; Lucas Torro, Jon Moncayola; Ruben Garcia, Aimar Oroz, Victor Munoz; Ante Budimir.Prediction It shouldn't be a difficult one for the team coached by Flick that have a chance to increase their gap with Real Madrid that are struggling. Pick: Barcelona 3, Osasuna 0. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Brandon Royval and Manel Kape want the next shot at UFC flyweight champion Joshua Van. Royval and Kape have an important audition on their hands at UFC Fight Night on Saturday, the final event of 2025 before UFC moves to Paramount+.Royval (17-8) is the most exciting flyweight contender around. He holds the solo record for most Fight of the Night bonuses in the division's history, and is tied for most flyweight performance bonuses. \"Raw Dog\" is kicking himself for his recent loss to Van, a Fight of the Year frontrunner. On one hand, Royval wants to mature into a more thoughtful fighter. On the other hand, he wants to see if Kape has what it takes to survive a firefight.\"It depends on how I show up. I want to be smart and tactical, but my gut feeling is to put Manel Kape in a fight and see what the f-- is up with him,\" Royval told CBS Sports. \"I feel he hasn't been in a real fight in the UFC. No one has tested that part of him. In a fistfight, I bet on myself over the entire world. I bet I can outwill him. That's for damn sure.\"I fought Joshua Van as dumb as I could fight somebody. I knew I would do that. I wanted to box him in the pocket. I wanted to prove something. It didn't work out necessarily. That being said, I want to out-technique Manel Kape, but if it ends up in a fist fight, there's nothing wrong with that either.\"\nKape (21-7) warns Royval to think twice about brawling with him. Kape is one knockout away from tying the record for most divisional history. His precision is reflected in the statistics: better striking accuracy, defense, and takedown defense than Royval. Kape has won six of his last seven fights, and a win over Royval (No. 2) could put him in the perfect position to earn the next shot at Van.\"I've been [studying] Brandon Royval a lot. To me, it's like I'm  fighting someone familiar,\" Kape told reporters on Wednesday. \"In training, everybody wants to look like  Brandon Royval, imitate him, for me it's (the) usual. I'll be very comfortable on Saturday night.\"I'm just going to prove that I'm the man. I'm the fighter with the  better style to be a champion. I'm the fighter that this division  needs.\"  \nCheck out the full interview with Brandon Royval below.\nThe final UFC card doesn't stand out at first glance, but it is packed with interesting prospects. Kevin Vallejos (16-1) has only lost to Jean Silva, the current No. 11-ranked featherweight contender. Vallejos is the only person in 14 fights to go the distance with Silva in a competitive fight. He can join Silva among the featherweight elite with a win over Giga Chikadze. Also on the main card are IBJJF Hall of Famer Marcus Buchecha and Lance Gibson Jr., son of UFC veteran Lance Gibson. Hidden on the prelims is the UFC debut of former Bellator welterweight champion Yaroslav Amosov (28-1), taking on record-breaking welterweight veteran Neil Magny.Let's take a look at the rest of the fight card with the latest odds before getting to a prediction and expert pick on the main event below.\nUFC Fight Night card, oddsOdds via DraftKings SportsbookFavoriteUnderdogWeightclassManel Kape -140Brandon Royval +100FlyweightKevin Vallejos -340Giga Chikadze +270FeatherweightCezary Oleksiejczuk -205Cesar Almeida +170  MiddleweightMelquizael Costa -125Morgan Charriere +105FeatherweightKennedy Nzechukwu -192Marcus Buchecha +110HeavyweightKing Green -192Lance Gibson Jr. +160  160-pound catchweightUFC Fight Night viewing informationDate: Dec. 13 | Start time: 10 p.m. ETLocation: UFC Apex -- Las VegasTV Channel: ESPN2 | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)  PredictionBrandon Royval vs. Manel Kape: Kape has never fought five rounds. His closest experience is a fourth-round submission win on the regional scene 10 years ago. Royval puts opponents in deep waters and edges out decisions. Just ask Tatsuro Taira, who Royval beat by split decision last year. The terms for Saturday's fight benefit Royval more than his opponent. The question is how much success will Kape have early in the fight. He's more powerful and technically proficient than Royval statistically. Royval's wrestling has improved, but it hasn't been his bread and butter. A textbook \"Raw Dog\" brawl is Royval's best chance to win. However, I worry Royval's chin gets cracked in the process, or he loses too many rounds early to cover ground late. Pick: Kape via KO3\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 college football bowl schedule begins on Saturday with Boise State vs. Washington (-10). Even with the postseason landscape rapidly changing, college football bowl confidence pools remain popular, and there are 39 matchups to make college football bowl confidence picks on this season. The two biggest spreads are in the CFP First Round as Oregon is favored by 21.5 points over James Madison, while Ole Miss is a 17.5-point favorite over Tulane. While putting faith in big favorites is a part of just about everyone's college football bowl confidence strategy, correctly predicting an upset could help you separate from the pack.Anticipated matchups outside of the CFP include Penn State vs. Clemson (-4.5), Georgia Tech vs. BYU (-4.5), Tennessee vs. Illinois (+4.5) and Michigan vs. Texas (-7.5). The Wolverines will operate under interim head coach Biff Poggi after dismissing Sherrone Moore. The college football odds give you an idea of what sportsbooks deem as favorites and underdogs, but you'll need more than just those when making bowl confidence bets. Before making any college football predictions for bowl season, be sure to see the latest college football bowl confidence picks from SportsLine's proven model.New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $75 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times, and it is profitable on its top-rated money-line picks since the beginning of the 2024 season.  Anybody following its college football betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now, it has turned its attention to the latest college football odds and 2025-26 bowl season college football betting for confidence pools. Head here to see every pick. New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Top 2025-26 college football bowl confidence picks  One of the model's most confident picks is that No. 21 Houston, a 3-point favorite, gets a double-digit win over LSU in the Texas Bowl on Dec. 27. Not only is this game in Texas, but it's in Houston, providing the obvious home-field advantage for the Cougars, as LSU has lost its last four games outside of Tiger Stadium. Meanwhile, the Cougars are 5-1 straight-up when favored this season, and the Tigers' offense limps into this matchup as it has a total of four touchdowns over the last four games and won't have quarterback Garrett Nussmeier. That's the same number that Houston had in its last game, alone, as the model has the Cougars winning in 80% of simulations. See all of the model's college football bowl confidence picks here.Another one of the bowl confidence predictions the model is high on: No. 16 USC (-5.5) gets a comfortable win over TCU in the Alamo Bowl on Dec. 30. USC went 9-3 in the regular season, with all three defeats coming versus ranked teams. TCU found itself in the Top 25 once -- back in September -- before having a pedestrian run through the Big 12 schedule, finishing 5-4. Even with the Horned Frogs playing in the easier conference than the Trojans, USC both averaged more points and allowed fewer points per game. USC sports a 32-9 (78%) straight-up record when favored since Lincoln Riley came aboard in 2022, as it is projected to easily take care of business in San Antonio. SportsLine's model has the Trojans prevailing nearly 70% of the time. See the rest of the college football bowl confidence predictions here. How to make college football bowl confidence picksThe model has also made the call on who wins every other bowl game. There are 11 teams that win at least 70% of the time, so you need to go big on those matchups, as well as 15 underdogs that win outright. You can get all the model's picks at SportsLine.So who wins every college football bowl game, and which matchups should you assign the most confidence points to?

The Wizards have lost three straight games, all by at least 15 points, and they are 1-4 over their last five games, with all four losses coming by at least 15 points. Even though Cleveland hasn't been as dominant as it was last year, the Cavaliers are still 14-11, and each of their last five wins has come by double-digit margins.

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 Serie A season is in full swing in Italy. Napoli started the campaign as defending champions after winning the 2024-25 title, their fourth Scudetto ever on the last matchday of the season. Inter, Juventus and AC Milan will compete with the team coached by Antonio Conte to win the Serie A title, while other teams such as AS Roma, Atalanta, Lazio, Fiorentina, Bologna and Como are all in contention for a spot in next season's European tournaments.This weekend's Serie A slate features some huge battles: Inter need to reactInter need to react after a disappointing Champions League week when the Nerazzurri lost 1-0 to Liverpool in the sixth matchday of the league phase after a controversial penalty scored by Dominik Szoboszlai. Cristian Chivu, the manager of the Italian giants, need to face a challenging start of the season against the big teams. Inter struggled against the strong teams, as they have already lost to both Atletico Madrid and Liverpool in Europe and lost to Napoli, AC Milan and Juventus in the Italian Serie A, showing a disappointing path against the stronger sides. This weekend, Inter will face Daniele De Rossi's Genoa away, a team that improved drastically since the appointment of the former AS Roma coach, with two wins against Verona and Udinese and two draws against Fiorentina and Cagliari. How to watch Serie A Matchday 15All times U.S./EasternFriday, December 12Lecce 1, Pisa 0, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)Saturday, December 13Torino vs. Cremonese, 9 a.m. (Paramount+)Parma vs. Lazio, 12 p.m. CBSAtalanta vs. Cagliari, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)Sunday, December 14AC Milan vs. Sassuolo, 6:30 a.m. (Paramount+)Udinese vs. Napoli, 9 a.m. (Paramount+)Fiorentina vs. Hellas Verona, 9 a.m. (Paramount+)Genoa vs. Inter, 12 p.m. (Paramount+)Bologna vs. Juventus, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)\nMonday, December 15AS Roma vs. Como, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)How to watch Parma vs. Lazio, oddsDate: Saturday, Dec. 13 | Time: 12 p.m. ETLocation: Stadio Ennio Tardini -- Parma Live stream: CBSOdds: Parma +255; Draw +224; Lazio +110\n            ",

For Week 15, let's go with two guys in Travis Etienne and Woody Marks. I expect both to go off in this scoring period.Let's start with Etienne, who is $6,500 on DraftKings and $7,500 on FanDuel. He's facing the Jets, who are No. 3 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing running backs. And in their past four games against the Patriots, Ravens, Falcons, and Dolphins, the Jets have allowed 10 total touchdowns to running backs, and six guys have scored at least 13.5 PPR points. Etienne has scored at least 15.7 PPR points in five of his past six games. He should be dominant in Week 15, and he's a great bargain at his cost.Marks is $5,600 on DraftKings and $6,500 on FanDuel. And he should have a big game against the Cardinals, who are No. 4 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing running backs. In the past five weeks, the backfields for Seattle, San Francisco, Jacksonville, Tampa Bay, and the Rams have combined for 133 carries for 712 yards and eight touchdowns, and 19 catches for 157 yards and two touchdowns on 23 targets. \nOver that span, six running backs have scored at least 14.3 PPR points against Arizona. And Marks just scored 15.6 PPR points in Week 14 at Kansas City.I plan to play both of these running backs in several lineups this week. And I'm expecting both to go off in this scoring period.\nFor more of my DFS plays for Week 15, click on this link to SportsLine.

    "body": "\n        We continue to work our way through a limited schedule this week because of the NBA Cup. While all eyes might be on the semifinals on Saturday, fantasy managers are scouring the waiver wire for players who can help their teams. Here are five players to consider adding who are still available in the majority of CBS leagues.Kyle Filipowski, Utah Jazz (50% rostered)Filipowski is averaging a modest 23 minutes per game for the season. Still, he has been fantasy relevant with averages of 9.6 points, 6.4 rebounds, 2.5 assists, and one 3-pointer. He has seen more playing time lately, logging at least 29 minutes across his last five games, two of which were starts. During that span, he provided 14 points, 8.2 rebounds, 3.4 assists, 1.4 steals, and 1.2 3-pointers a night.The Jazz are well on their way to another season of missing out on the playoffs. As they continue to rack up losses, it would not be a surprise if veteran Jusuf Nurkic is traded or takes a back seat to Filipowski. There is also the potential for a Lauri Markkanen trade. Over 28 games after the All-Star break last season, Filipowski averaged 14.3 points, 8.1 rebounds, 2.3 assists, and 1.7 3-pointers. As his role looks to be expanding, adding him now could pay off in the long run.Herbert Jones, New Orleans Pelicans (38% rostered)Jones recently missed eight straight games with a calf strain. He started and played 26 minutes in his return Monday, then logged 14 minutes in a start against the Trail Blazers on Thursday before being ejected. Even with the emergence of Derik Queen and Saddiq Bey, Jones should play around 30 minutes on a nightly basis, especially with Zion Williamson (adductor) currently out.\nEven with ample playing time, Jones isn't likely to provide a ton of scoring. The reason to roster him in fantasy is because of his ability to rack up steals. He has averaged 1.5 steals per game this season and has never finished a season averaging fewer than 1.4 steals. For those hunting for help in the category, there may be no better player to add off the waiver wire than Jones.Maxime Raynaud, Sacramento Kings (37% rostered)The Kings continue to play without Domantas Sabonis, who is working his way through a partially torn meniscus. They initially turned to Drew Eubanks to replace Sabonis in the starting lineup, but that experiment didn't last long. A much more productive option has been Raynaud, who has played at least 22 minutes in each of the last six games.With Raynaud receiving additional opportunities, he has averaged 15.5 points, 7.2 rebounds, 1.8 assists, and 0.8 blocks over that six-game span. The rookie is not only shooting 52.7% from the field this season, but he has also made 75.9% of his attempts from the charity stripe. The Kings tend to make some weird lineup decisions, but with how well he is playing and their lack of options with Sabonis out, it would be a surprise if Raynaud doesn't remain in his new role.\nDaniel Gafford, Dallas Mavericks (31% rostered)Gafford is currently battling an ankle injury. After injuries limited him to 57 games last season, Gafford has appeared in just 15 games this season. When he has played, he has been underwhelming with averages of 8.9 points and 6.4 rebounds, although he has averaged 1.4 blocks and shot 61% from the field.None of the above seems to be making a case for adding Gafford. However, the Mavericks delivered the news Wednesday that Dereck Lively II (foot) is set to undergo season-ending surgery. Anthony Davis has expressed multiple times that he prefers not to play center, so the Lively injury could provide a boost for Gafford for the remainder of the season. Once Gafford gets through his current ankle issue, he has a path to play around 20-25 minutes a game.Marcus Smart, Los Angeles Lakers (9% rostered)Smart recently missed six games with a back injury. He returned in grand fashion Wednesday, scoring 26 points over 28 minutes off the bench against the Spurs. Smart took a whopping 14 three-point attempts, making eight of them. While bouncing in and out of the starting lineup, the veteran has averaged 27 minutes in his first season with the Lakers.\nSmart's overall averages of 10.4 points, 2.3 rebounds, and 2.8 assists through 15 games are nothing to write home about. However, that doesn't mean he's not a viable fantasy option in deeper formats. He is also averaging 1.6 three-pointers and 1.7 steals. Prior to last season's disastrous stints with the Grizzlies and Wizards, Smart had averaged at least 1.6 3-pointers and 1.5 steals in five straight seasons. The Lakers don't have a ton of quality depth, so there should be enough minutes available for Smart to help fantasy managers in both departments again.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        For at least one day, Liverpool were able to look past their turmoil after defeating Inter 1-0 in Champions League play on Tuesday. Fans chanting Arne Slot's name showed a shift from backing Mohamed Salah in his current power struggle to supporting the manager who is tasked with leading the Reds through this rough patch in their form. They've shown glimpses in the Champions League, but sitting 10th in the Premier League behind rivals Everton and a newly promoted Sunderland, this hasn't followed the Reds into the Premier League.How to watch Liverpool vs. Brighton, oddsDate: Saturday, Dec. 13 | Time: 10 a.m. ETLocation: Anfield -- Liverpool, EnglandLive stream: PeacockOdds: Liverpool -150; Draw +320; Brighton +370As the team returns to domestic play on Saturday, focus shifts back to Salah as this could be his final game for Liverpool, and there's no guarantee that he'll even feature. Salah will be released for the Africa Cup of Nations to compete with Egypt on Dec. 15, following this match facing Brighton, and with a run that could take him to Jan. 18 if Egypt makes it to the final of the competition, the transfer window could be wide open upon his return.Slot didn't offer much clarity as to whether Salah would get to make an appearance against Brighton, but that also does make sense as this is a developing situation by the hour, let alone the day.\"Salah in our out against Brighton? I will speak to Mo in the next few hours, and this conversation will determine all next steps,\" Slot said in his prematch press conference before facing Brighton.While it's hard to see a way back for Salah after he went on record stating that someone at the club wants to push him out and that he's been thrown under the bus, it's also true that Liverpool wouldn't have many suitors for the Egyptian star in January. According to the Athletic, those discussions were positive and will see Salah return to the Liverpool squad for facing Brighton before departing for AFCON.\nConsidering potential transfers, if San Diego FC can't enter the picture, it could be a trip to the Saudi Pro League or bust for Salah. It'd be a tall task for another European side to meet Salah's salary demands, but there's also the case that Liverpool would want a transfer fee for Salah. With the 33-year-old on the wrong side of the aging curve and only having five goals and three assists all season while failing to register a goal contribution in seven consecutive matches, it's hard to see why someone would see that and decide to roll the Brinks truck up to Anfield to secure his signature -- not to mention that Salah put all his cards on the table, far from the best transfer strategy.Liverpool were going to need to eventually think about life without Salah, but it wasn't something that was the plan one year removed from winning the title; however, this season does provide them with an opportunity to plan for that. Even if Salah doesn't depart in January, Liverpool are already 10 points off the pace of Arsenal atop the league, the title race may not be over for Liverpool, but this is also a time when their best opportunities for silverware will come in the Champions League and cups.Knocking off Inter and Real Madrid in European play, there's no reason that Liverpool can't win the Champions League despite their domestic struggles. The Premier League can be a ground for figuring out what the best configuration is to do that as while they'll want to get back into a European place in the table, even with rotation, there's enough talent in the squad to do it. The Inter win saw Hugo Ekitike and Alexander Isak lead the line together, and more experimentation will be needed. \nLast season, Salah running hot and scoring 29 goals and assisting 18 more was enough to lead Liverpool to the title, but with that form out of the equation, Slot has a big question to answer on how to replace them. The expectation was that Isak would continue his own Premier League form after consecutive seasons of scoring 20 or more goals with Newcastle United but it has actually been Ekitike who has been the more effective of the forwards with seven goals and two assists in all competitions. It's far too early to say that Isak won't be a good fit at Liverpool, but the time is now for Slot to figure out how to get the best out of the Swedish striker.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Caitlin Clark spoke to reporters Friday at Duke University during USA Basketball training camp and made a plea for compromise in the labor battle between the WNBA and the players, which has been raging for months as the two sides try to come to terms on a new collective bargaining agreement. Clark called this the \"biggest moment the WNBA has ever seen,\" and added that while the players are going to \"fight for everything we deserve,\" they \"need to play basketball.\" The WNBA and the Women's National Basketball Players Association recently agreed to a 40-day extension on the current CBA -- the second extension since the 2025 season came to a close -- which pushed the new expiration date to Jan. 9, 2026. \n        \n            \n                WNBA CBA negotiations: New league offer boosts salaries but disrupts March Madness and cuts housing benefits\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThere has been movement in recent weeks. Notably, the WNBA offered a proposal with a significant increase in pay -- base max contract above $1 million, average salary above $500,00 and minimum salary above $225,000 -- and a form of revenue sharing. However, the league also suggested a possible mid-March starting date for training camp and eliminating housing subsidies for the players. \nA deal does not appear imminent, and the clock is ticking to ensure the 2026 season starts on time. Already, the offseason has been disrupted. The Golden State Valkyries held their expansion draft on Dec. 6 last year; it's unclear when the Toronto Tempo and Portland Fire will be able to do the same. As negotiations continue, here are Clark's full comments from Friday:\"This is the biggest moment the WNBA has ever seen. It's not something that can be messed up. We're going to fight for everything we deserve, but at the same time we need to play basketball. That's what our fans crave and that's what all of you crave as well. You want the product on the floor. At the end of the day that's how you make the money, that's how you're marketable, that's what the fans get excited about, that's what the fans want to show up for. \"It's business and it's a negotiation and there has to be compromise on both sides. We're starting to get down to the wire of it, and it's become really important. Obviously, I want to help in any way I can, and I've tried to educate myself the best I can. And obviously, I can't speak to every single number, it's pretty complicated, but I think there are different things that we can find ways to say, 'no, we certainly deserve that and we're not going to compromise on that,' and then other things that we can probably compromise on.\"Like I said, this is the biggest moment in the history of the WNBA, and I don't want that to be forgotten. It's important that we find a way to play this next season. I think our fans, even everybody that has played in this league and come before us deserve that as well.\"Clark pledges loyalty to WNBAAs the WNBA's CBA standoff continues, there have been plenty of questions about other leagues, including Unrivaled and Athletes Unlimited. No other venture has generated more headlines, however, than the newly created Project B, which plans to launch in the fall of 2026. The ambitious new league, which will play in a number of locations in Europe and Asia, is offering seven-figure salaries and has already signed a number of WNBA stars, including WNBPA president Nneka Ogwumike, Alyssa Thomas, Jewell Loyd, Jonquel Jones and Kelsey Mitchell. Another of Clark's Fever teammates, Sophie Cunningham, has also signed, and said recently on her podcast that she tried to recruit Clark to join, but was rebuffed. Asked Friday about Project B, Clark pledged her loyalty to the WNBA. \"I plan to play in the WNBA,\" Clark said. \"Obviously that's another thing we need to get done so we have a season coming up here.\"Clark did, however, praise the fact that there are more options than ever for women's basketball players. \n\"I think more than anything, it showcases what people think of women's basketball. All of these different opportunities, all of these different leagues, the platform that they want to give women's basketball, where they think women's basketball is gonna continue to grow. I think that's probably the thing that pops into my mind is just that -- when people are really believing and putting their money where their mouth is,\" Clark said. \"That hasn't always been the case for women's basketball, no matter how great it's been over the course of the last 25-30 years. I think for myself, I think that's what I'm most proud of is how excited people are to want to invest and support women's basketball more than anything.\"Clark says she's 'back to 100%'Clark's sophomore season in the WNBA was a disaster. She only appeared in 13 games due to an array of lower body injuries -- left quad, left groin, right groin and left ankle -- and didn't play after July 15. When she was on the floor, she rarely looked like herself, and shot 36.7% from the field, including 27.9% from 3-point range.During her exit interview after the Fever were eliminated from the playoffs, Clark noted that her goal was to be healthy and compete for Team USA during the offseason, and she said Friday that it \"feels nice to finally be back to 100%.\" While she admitted that it \"took probably longer than I expected,\" she's happy to know her body is \"in a really good spot.\"Now, she can finally focus solely on her game instead of rehab. \n\"Honestly I feel like when I touched the basketball to start warming up before the practice even started, that's probably when I felt pretty comfortable,\" Clark said. \"I worked so hard, like I haven't taken a break since the beginning of the WNBA season with all my rehab, getting back to where I wanted to be and getting even better. That's been my focus. This has been my next thing I've been working for since our season ended. \"For myself, it's not proving it to yourself again, it's just that feeling. It just made me smile quite a bit. I really did feel like myself out there, and just continuing to get my lungs back, but I felt like I was moving really well, so it was pretty satisfying.\"\n            ",

Harbaugh was asked about the situation during a media appearance Friday. \"Chad Jessop told me, one of our equipment guys, when we were coming off the field on Thursday,\" Harbaugh said. \"So I'm still processing that like a lot of people.\" Harbaugh hired Moore to his Michigan staff in 2018 as tight ends coach. Moore was promoted to co-offensive coordinator in 2021 and assumed sole play-calling responsibilities in 2023. Moore also served as Michigan's acting head coach for one game during the 2023 season after Harbaugh was suspended for three games following the Big Ten's investigation into Michigan's sign-stealing scandal. Harbaugh and Moore guided Michigan to a 15-0 record in 2023, capped by a win against Washington in the College Football Playoff National Championship. Michigan tabbed Moore as Harbaugh's successor when Harbaugh made his return to the NFL with the Chargers ahead of the 2024 campaign. \nIn two seasons as Michigan's coach, Moore amassed a 15-8 record. He was suspended for two games in 2025 after the university self-imposed a penalty for Moore's role in the sign-stealing scheme. The 39-year-old Moore was fired for cause on Dec. 10. Athletic director Warde Manuel confirmed Moore's termination was the result of Moore's \"inappropriate relationship with a staff member.\"Moore was arrested shortly after his firing and, on Friday, was handed three charges, including felony home invasion, by the Washtenaw County (Mich.) Prosecutor's Office. He is accused of \"unlawfully entering the victim's residence to commit the crime of stalking and committing that crime while in the residence.\" \nHe was also charged with stalking and breaking and entering or entering without breaking, which are both misdemeanors. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        This week Michigan's board of regents authorized a law firm to expand its investigation into the athletic department's handling of the Sherrone Moore situation, a person familiar with the decision told CBS Sports on Friday.The law firm Jenner & Block has been tasked with the review, which the source described as an \"open-ended\" inquiry into the athletic department. CBS Sports granted the source anonymity because of the sensitivity of the investigation.Moore, 39, was fired with cause during a one-on-one meeting with athletics director Warde Manuel on Wednesday afternoon after evidence of an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. Information on that relationship was turned over to the department that morning, sources told CBS Sports. Hours later, Moore was sitting in jail after allegedly breaking into a female staff member's home and threatening to harm himself with butter knives and scissors, according to the Washtenaw County (Mich.) Prosecutor's Office and Pittsfield Township police. \nThe Detroit News first reported Friday that Michigan's board authorized an expanded probe into the athletics department. The development follows a letter from university president Domenico Grasso to students and faculty, encouraging anyone with additional information related to Moore to contact Jenner & Block.\"This breach of trust by coach Moore is painful for many in our community, first and foremost, the individuals directly involved in this situation,\" president Domenico Grasso wrote in the letter obtained Thursday by CBS Sports. \"Yet our swift and decisive action reflects the university's staunch commitment to a campus culture of respect, integrity and accountability.\"\nMoore was detained by police Wednesday and formally charged Friday with felony home invasion, along with misdemeanor charges of stalking and breaking and entering or entering without breaking. He was released Friday afternoon on a $25,000 cash surety bond. A judge ordered the continuation of mental health treatment, imposed a GPS tether, restricted Moore from leaving the state of Michigan, and barred him from any contact with the alleged victim.Moore appeared in court Friday afternoon via video conference, wearing a white jail-issued shirt and pants, seated alone in a small room. A prosecutor said during the arraignment that Moore told the alleged victim: \"I'm going to kill myself. I'm going to make you watch. My blood is on your hands. You ruined my life.\"The prosecutor later added that the alleged victim \"was terrorized\" by Moore's behavior.\nMoore is due back in court Jan. 22 for a probable cause conference.Moore was 16-8 in two seasons leading the Wolverines. He was promoted from offensive coordinator to head coach after Jim Harbaugh left for the NFL following the school's first national title since 1997. Associated head coach Biff Poggi was named interim head coach Wednesday as the university searches for Moore's replacement. Michigan (9-3) is scheduled to play Texas in the Citrus Bowl on New Year's Eve.Richard Johnson contributed to this report.\n            ",

With Smith out, Kenny Pickett will start against the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday. Pickett was the backup to Jalen Hurts for the Eagles last season when they won the Super Bowl. \"He's (Pickett) done everything we could ask of him,\" Carroll said Friday. \"He had an excellent week. He's in command of what we're doing. Communications are good and all that. Got a little East Coast in him, so that won't hurt.\"Smith departed from the Week 14 loss after a hit to his shoulder at the end of the third quarter. Carroll said after the game that his shoulder \"locked up\" and that tests did not reveal any structural damage. Smith was 13 for 21 for 116 yards and a touchdown when he headed to the locker room. Pickett entered in relief and completed eight of 11 passes for 97 yards and a score of his own.Despite Pickett's effectiveness in the fourth quarter and Smith's season-long struggles, Carroll said after the Denver loss that he intends to start Smith moving forward if he is available. Carroll said Friday there's a strong chance Smith will be healthy in time for Week 16. \n\n        \n            \n                Raiders vs. Eagles prediction: Las Vegas battles, but Philadelphia bounces back to end losing streak\n                \n                    Bryan DeArdo                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSmith's arrival in Las Vegas ahead of the 2025 season was a source of optimism, as his familiarity with Carroll and his promising young supporting cast indicated the potential for a strong debut campaign with his new team. Instead, this year has been a disastrous one for the NFL's lowest-scoring offense.Only six teams passed for fewer yards through Week 14, and Smith's 14 interceptions are the most of any quarterback. The result is a 2-11 record which places the Raiders at the bottom of the AFC standings.\nWith Pickett stepping into the starting lineup against the Eagles, it will be his fourth appearance and first start of the year. Pickett spent 2024 in Philadelphia and started one game -- a 41-7 win over the Dallas Cowboys. The former first-round pick opened his career with the Pittsburgh Steelers but did not catch on as a starter with any of his three teams and has 16 career touchdowns to 14 interceptions.\n            \n    ",

Yahoo Sports was first to report the news on Friday night. A final decision on the move is expected in the next few weeks.\"To date, the RedBird ecosystem has delivered over $145 million of contracted revenue to the Big 12 and its member institutions,\" the Big 12 said in a statement to Yahoo. \"This partnership would provide the Conference with a world-class strategic and capital partner, while preserving 100% of the member institutions' equity in the Big 12.\"Earlier this week, Utah, a member of the Big 12, finalized a landmark private equity partnership with New York-based firm Otro Capital that will help generate an estimated $500 million for the school. That deal, which would be the first of its kind in college athletics, is expected to be finalized in early 2026.Last year, CBS Sports reported that Big 12 members were considering a first-of-its-kind private equity investment to ensure the league's long-term financial and competitive security. On the table was a possible cash infusion of $800 million to $1 billion from Luxembourg-based CVC Capital Partners in exchange for a 15% to 20% stake in the league.\nThe Big 12 isn't the only conference considering private equity. CBS Sports confirmed in October that the Big Ten is considering an enormous equity deal, potentially worth upwards of $2 billion. The deal would also extend the Big Ten's grant of rights until 2046.\n            \n    ",

Buffalo will try to keep its hopes of winning the AFC East intact as New England seals a division title with a victory.Either way, the Bills are likely head to the playoffs once again, and Allen will be tasked with delivering a Super Bowl for the first time in franchise history. With the Kansas City Chiefs, Baltimore Ravens and Cincinnati Bengals all out of the postseason at the moment, the AFC is as wide open as it's been in a long time.\nIt may be hard to top the year he's having right now, but if Allen can get his first Super Bowl, that would be a decent start to 2026.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Pat Spencer fits the Hollywood blueprint for an underdog sports story. Little (by NBA standards). Un-drafted. The guy didn't play college basketball until he was a fifth-year senior following a legendary lacrosse career. He played overseas. Worked his way through the Warriors' system from the ground up -- summer league to the G-League to, now, a two-way contract with the big club, for which he has turned into something of a cult hero. Over his last four games, Spencer is averaging 16 points, 5.8 assists and 4 rebounds on 59% shooting. He's made six of his last eight 3-pointers and is at 44% for the season. Not bad for a guy who couldn't shoot a lick from deep in his lone college season. Spencer has obviously put in a ton a work to get to this point. You don't have to know the fine-print details of his journey to know that he surely could've given up at many points. He never did. And now here he is, a driving force behind Golden State salvaging a 3-2 record -- which was seconds away from being 4-1 -- over a five-game stretch without Stephen Curry.  Warriors fans are losing their collective mind over this guy, and it's understandable. Spencer is on his own little version of a Linsanity run at the moment, barking out \"I'm that motherf---er\" in Philadelphia one night:\nWaving goodbye to the Cleveland crowd the next:\nSpencer is understandably feeling himself, and his game, and more importantly so is Steve Kerr, the man in control of the minutes. Kerr put Spencer into the starting lineup against the Cavs, and he responded with 19 points, seven assists and three rebounds in what was a huge win over an expected title contender without Curry, Jimmy Butler or Draymond Green in uniform. The Warriors were, and for all intents and purposes still are, treading water for their playoff life in what is, as expected, a murderous Western Conference. When Curry found himself sidelined for two weeks, there was a real chance he was going to come back to a sub-.500 team. Instead, he's expected back on Friday night vs. the Timberwolves and suddenly the 13-12 Warriors, after a much-needed three-day break without a game, feel like a team with some juice behind them again. Give Spencer his flowers. He played a major part in this little turnaround, and he's going to keep playing a part (we'll see how major it is) even as the Warriors' stars return to full health. \n\"We'll have to find out,\" Kerr said earlier this week on 95.7 The Game when asked what Spencer's role will look like with Curry back. \"I'm not going to take away all his minutes, I can tell you that. I'm definitely going to play him with Steph some. Some of it will depend on matchups. How well we can hold up defensively. ... But the way Pat is playing, the way he's impacting winning, the way he's impacting just the competitive spirit of the team, I have to keep playing him.\"Here's where it gets interesting, because up until these past few weeks everything Spencer has given the Warriors has been gravy. For the most part, he was a cheerleader with a mustache. Now he's set a higher standard, and that comes with expectations. Expectations, as a league scout said to me a few years back, are the root of frustration. I loved that line. I use it all the time. It's so true. Particularly for NBA role players. Just look at a guy like Brandin Podziemski, who has become the punching bag of Warriors Twitter. People make it like the Warriors are a Little League team and Podz is only playing because Kerr is his dad. Like he doesn't even belong on an NBA court. \nIt's ridiculous. Podziemski has been a winning player pretty much from the that instant he arrived in Golden State. As a rookie, the Warriors outscored their opponents by 5.3 points per 100 possessions when he was on the floor, per Cleaning the Glass. Last year, that number rose to plus-6.8, and when you filter out the small-sample stuff and look at only the Podz lineups that logged at least 50 possessions together, the Warriors were plus-22.6 with Podz playing. This year the inclusive number doesn't look so great but it's still a positive at plus-0.8, and again, the nine lineups with which Podziemski has logged at least 20 possessions are, on average, plus-10.5 per 100. \nThis is not a coincidence. Podziemski isn't perfect, but at his best he's a Josh Hart type of player to which all the things that add up to winning can be tied. On energy alone he's super valuable. He's an elite positional rebounder. He's always at the top of the league in charges taken. On a team that, collectively, struggles to create downhill pressure, he actually gets into the paint. Every season Podziemski's scoring numbers have gotten better on almost identical minutes. He's currently shooting 40% on five 3-pointers per game. This is a guy who makes things happen, plain and simple. If you think he hasn't put together stretches like this one Spencer is on right now, you're crazy. \nThe problem is the heightened expectations that have been placed on Podz, in part because of showings like this, There's also the commitment Kerr has shown to letting him to play through mistakes when other young players haven't been afforded the same freedom, which annoys fans when they watch him dribble himself dizzy and head-fake his way into bad shots and turnovers.\nAnd let's not forget the absolutely crazy expectations Podziemski put on himself when, prior to the season, he basically told Nick Friedell of The Athletic that he wants, and on some level expects, to be the player to whom Curry eventually hands the keys to the franchise. There's confidence and there's delusion, and if Podziemski honestly thinks he's the next franchise player, he's leaning heavily toward the latter. But that's just perception stuff. The reality is this: If Spencer were to put up Podziemki's numbers over a 100-plus-game sample, it would be regarded as a massive success. For Podziemski, even as he has had plenty it leaves you wanting more. Expectations are the root of frustration. Let Spencer play real minutes in a lot of real games. Let him feel the heat of postseason possessions with the ball in his hands. This isn't suggest that what Spencer has achieved these past few weeks has been a fluke. Any time he's gotten any minutes he has shown, increasingly, that he can play. He has almost surely made himself millions of dollars on his next deal. He might actually be better suited to initiate offense than Podziemski, who is at his best off the ball, attacking gaps against defenses in motion and can get himself into trouble trying to create too much chaos on his own. \nSpencer knows his role in this way. He organizes. Keeps the ball and flow moving. That's why Kerr wants to play him alongside Curry, because he's a natural for possessions designed to run through a maze of off-ball movement until the greatest shooter ever eventually pops into the open, whereas Podz is sometimes apt to get a little impatient if he's give control of the ball. In a perfect world the fans won't need to pit these guys against one another, but it's true that they do serve some of the same functions and may, if Spencer keeps this up, be in competition for minutes. Against OKC, Kerr subbed out Spencer, who was playing brilliantly as Golden State was in position to pull off a major upset without Curry and Butler (who left the game in the first half) against the best team in the league, at the 3:56 of the fourth quarter for Podziemski, and from that point forward the Warriors went from a four-point deficit to a 12-point loss. Kerr talked about the decision afterward and noted that it was a tough call because \"both guys really played great games.\" \nIt's true. Both Podziemski and Spencer finished with 17 points. Spencer added six assists. Podziemski hit three of his five 3s and was 6-of-11 overall. And yet, fans were fuming that Kerr would dare put Podz back in the game. Spencer is their guy right now. Half of them wanted Podz traded a long time ago and remain annoyed by the organization's two-timeline approach, of which Podziemski is a core part. Spencer, meanwhile, can do no wrong at the moment. Give it some time. With enough exposure, all role players show their flaws. That's why they're role players. The only difference here is that Spencer knows he's a role player. Hell, it took a potential career-changing four-game run to even be considered that. He hasn't shouldered any real expectations yet, but they're coming. Let's see what he does with them. \n            ",

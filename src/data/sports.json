    "body": "\n        The first round of the 2025 College football Playoff concludes on Saturday night when the No. 5 Oregon Ducks host the No. 12 James Madison Dukes. James Madison, the Sun Belt champion, got a spot in the CFP bracket thanks in large part to Duke upsetting Virginia in the ACC title game, making JMU one of the five highest-ranked conference champions. Oregon had a strong 11-1 campaign, but didn't hold a tiebreaker to get into the Big Ten title game. The winner advances to face No. 4 Texas Tech in the Orange Bowl on New Year's Day. Kickoff from Autzen Stadium is set for 7:30 p.m. ET. The Ducks are 20.5-point favorites in the latest Oregon vs. James Madison odds, while the over/under is 45.5.

Oregon is the largest favorite to this point in any bowl or playoff game, and that's because the Ducks own a huge talent edge across the board and will be playing on their home field. Quarterback Dante Moore is a possible top pick in the 2026 NFL Draft as he comes into this matchup with 2,733 passing yards, 24 touchdown passes and just six interceptions on the season. Dan Lanning's squad also ranked third in the Big Ten in scoring defense (14.8 points per game) and will present a challenge that James Madison isn't accustomed to.

The Dukes are built to run the ball, leading the Sun Belt with 245.7 yards per game on the ground. Running back Wayne Knight led the way with 1,263 rushing yards, while quarterback Alonza Barnett III had 544 yards and 14 scores on the ground. That proficiency on the ground could shrink this game and give the three-score underdog a chance to keep this one within the number against an Oregon team that was blown out in its only CFP game last season.

Bruce Marshall, who is 45-26-2 over his last 73 NFL ATS picks, is backing the Chargers (+1.5) to cover versus the Cowboys on Sunday.\"Dallas should have had more left in the tank for last Sunday's 34-26 loss to the Vikings, and the defense is starting to resemble its poor form from the first half of the season while allowing 39 ppg in consecutive losses to the Lions and Vikes,\" said Marshall. \"As for the Bolts, they're still playing inspired defense while continuing to chase Denver in the AFC West, and Justin Herbert's left wrist has had another week to heal and get him closer to 100%. This is arguably a tougher test for Dallas than others they didn't pass the past two weeks.

R.J. White is +585 on his past 281 NFL picks, and he's backing Jalen Hurts as an anytime TD scorer in the early kick. \"The Eagles finally got back on track against the Raiders, and this is another good matchup for their offense,\" White said. \"The Washington defense has allowed 3+ TDs in every game played stateside since Week 6, and giving up 21 points and 384 yards to the Giants last week represents one of their best outings in that stretch. We're used to seeing Hurts' ATD prop at much shorter odds in this type of matchup, and even if Lane Johnson isn't able to make it back this week, I think he shouldn't be plus odds to score against a defense that gives up loads of points.\" Get more Eagles vs. Commanders picks here and see Packers vs. Bears picks right here. Patriots vs. Ravens 'Sunday Night Football' picks An important AFC matchups unfolds on Sunday night when the Ravens host the Patriots. The Pats (11-2) currently are the No. 2 seed in the AFC, while the Ravens (7-6) would be just outside the field if the playoffs started now. Claudia Bellofatto has nailed four of her past five NFL player prop picks, and she's backing Drake Maye to go Over on his passing yards on 'SNF.'\"He's cashed this in all but two of the last 10 and he's now facing a Ravens defense allowing the 5th most attempts and over 245 yards a game. We should get either a close game or negative game script to help us get over. Last week was only Maye's second game all season dipping 60% or less on completion percentage. He still leads the league in that category as well as being 2nd in yards per attempt. Plus, he's 3-0 straight up and ATS in career primetime games. I like a bounce back for the Pats MVP and possibly the league's, if he can catch back up to Stafford.\" See more Eagles vs. Ravens picks here.Pick Maye to go Over 242.5 passing yards at DraftKings:\n            ",

Booker was flagged for roughing the passer for the contact to Love's head.\nThe Packers confirmed that Love was undergoing evaluation for a concussion and listed his possible return to the pivotal NFC North game as questionable.

Watt will miss his second consecutive game after undergoing surgery to repair a partially collapsed lung suffered while getting treatment at the team facility. However, Mike Tomlin hasn't shut the door on a Week 17 return for Watt.While Watt wasn't practicing this week, he was back at the team's facility and doing some \"cardio,\" Tomlin told CBS Sports' Tracy Wolfson. With Watt back in the facility, the Steelers are \"hopeful\" their star pass rusher will be back on the field next week when they take on the Cleveland Browns.Watt went to Pittsburgh area hospital last Wednesday after he experienced discomfort in his chest after a dry needling treatment session. He is expected to return to the field this season, per NFL Network. The 31-year-old Watt is in the middle of his ninth season with the Steelers, who selected him with the 30th overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft. A seven-time Pro Bowler and four-time All-Pro, Watt won NFL Defensive Player of the Year honors in 2021 after tying the league's single-season record of 22.5 sacks. Watt, who has led the NFL in sacks on three separate occasions, is the Steelers' career leader with 115 sacks. He surpassed brother and future Hall of Famer JJ Watt on the NFL's career sack list this season. \nIn 13 games this season, Watt has seven sacks, three forced fumbles, two fumble recoveries and an interception. With Watt and Nick Herbig (hamstring) out, the Steelers' pass rush will likely lean heavily on veteran Alex Highsmith and rookie Jack Sawyer during Sunday's game against the Detroit Lions. The Steelers are 8-6 and lead the Baltimore Ravens by one game in the AFC North standings. Highsmith is tied for second on the team with 6.5 sacks. Sawyer has one sack, an interception, 26 tackles and three pass breakups in 14 games. \n\"He's had some opportunities this year and has made some plays,\" Tomlin recently said of Sawyer. \"Has had a sack. Has had an interception. So, I wouldn't be surprised if he displays that readiness if he gets an expanded role opportunity this week.\"\n            \n    ",

On the first drive of the second half, Mariota pulled up after running toward the sideline and is now questionable to return.On a third-down play, Mariota escaped the pocket and threw the ball away after trying to buy some extra time. Eagles defensive lineman Jordan Davis was in pursuit when Mariota finished the play awkwardly. As Washington sent the punt unit out, Mariota was in clear discomfort on the sideline.During the Eagles' ensuing possession, backup quarterback Josh Johnson warmed up while Mariota jogged off the field and toward the locker room.\nThe Commanders reported that Mariota was evaluated for a concussion during a brief stint in the injury tent. While Mariota cleared the concussion protocol, he is still being evaluated for a right hand injury.Before exiting the game, Mariota completed seven of his 14 passing attempts for 95 yards. He only had one rushing attempt, which lost a yard.\nWith star quarterback Jayden Daniels sidelined for most of the season, Mariota has now started eight games. Entering Saturday, Mariota had completed 62.0% of his passes for 1,600 yards, 10 touchdowns and seven interceptions while adding 298 yards and a score on the ground.Johnson, 39, replaced the injured Mariota, and it marks his first real action of the 2025 season. Johnson, who has played for an NFL record 14 teams, registered appearances in two games, but he didn't attempt a pass in either one.Johnson hasn't taken meaningful snaps since the 2021 season when he started a game for the Baltimore Ravens. In 47 career games (and nine starts), Johnson has completed 58.1% of his throws for 2,297 yards, 13 touchdowns and 16 interceptions. He also brings some mobility with 426 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown.\nThe Commanders entered Saturday with a 4-10 record. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Kentucky big man Jayden Quaintance, a projected lottery pick in the 2026 NBA Draft, made his season debut Saturday during the Wildcats' 78-66 win against St. John's in the CBS Sports Classic. Quaintance, who transferred from Arizona State this past offseason, logged 17 minutes and finished with 10 points, eight rebounds and two blocks.Quaintance, who transferred from Arizona State this past offseason, was recovering from a torn ACL that was repaired in March.\"This has been a long time in the making,\" Quaintance said. \"I've been a competitor my whole life. I was always raised competing, That's all I ever wanted to do. I continued to trust my guys and I feel like that trust in guys built just being here on the bench, it kind of translated over. (It) showed on the court.\"The Wildcats are off to a 8-4 start in Pope's second season at his alma mater. Entering the weekend, Kentucky was coming off back-to-back wins over NC Central and Indiana after suffering a 35-point loss to Gonzaga earlier this month. Before the comeback win over Indiana, Kentucky's best win this season was against Valparaiso.\n\"It's just been slow for us to grow up and embrace who exactly we are, and we're in that process,\" Pope said. \"We're in the early stages of that process. This is an important day for us because we know back-to-back games, seeing some real physicality and some smash mouth basketball. Sometimes it's ugly, but sometimes it's beautiful like it was at moments in the second half of this game.\"Quaintance averaged 9.4 points, 7.9 rebounds and 2.6 blocks during the 2024-25 campaign at ASU while being the youngest player in Division l basketball. He would've been the third-youngest player in last year's McDonald's All-American Game had he stayed in his original high school recruiting class.\nWhat makes Quaintance an elite NBA prospectQuaintance's calling card is his defense. Despite being the youngest player in Division I basketball last season, he played like one of the best defenders in the country. Although some of Kentucky's struggles and slow start can be attributed to the team's 3-point shooting regression, it doesn't hurt to bring Quaintance into the fold. \nIt wouldn't be surprising to see Quaintance eased back into action -- like he was against St. John's -- before eventually being promoted back to the starting lineup.\"When he goes (in), he's going to be on restriction, for sure,\" Pope said earlier this week. \"There's the conditioning part, when you haven't hit guys and run around and change direction and respond to the unpredictable movements. Fatigue is your enemy. It's fatigue with every part of your body, some of your natural instincts are just going to be declined, right? That's shaking off the rust.\"In the CBS Sports NBA Draft Prospect Rankings, Quaintance is ranked No. 7 overall and is the highest-ranked non-freshman on the list.\nQuaintance, who just turned 18 this past July, was ineligible for the 2025 NBA Draft due to his age. NBA rules state that a player must be at least 19 years old during the calendar year of the draft, which opened the door for Quaintance to play two seasons in college. If Quaintance were eligible this past summer, he would've surely been a top 10 selection.Quaintance unique entry in transfer portal eraQuaintance originally signed to play for John Calipari but backed off that pledge after the former UK coach took the vacant job at Arkansas. The former No. 9 overall player in the 2024 recruiting cycle, according to 247Sports, committed shortly after to Arizona State and became the highest-ranked recruit in program history.Since the 2021 NBA Draft, the highest-drafted player who previously entered the transfer portal was Davion Mitchell, who started his career at Auburn before transferring to Baylor. Mitchell improved his draft stock significantly under coach Scott Drew and was drafted No. 9 overall by the Sacramento Kings.\nCedric Coward, who was selected No. 11 overall by the Memphis Grizzlies this past summer, was one of the highest-drafted players in the transfer portal era. He transferred from Eastern Washington to Washington State before becoming a lottery pick. In fact, Coward entered the transfer portal again after the end of last season and committed to Duke before electing to keep his name in the draft.The highest-drafted transfer last summer was former Providence star Devin Carter, who started his career at South Carolina and was drafted No. 12 by the Kings in the 2024 NBA Draft. Other first-round picks in that 2024 draft class who started their college career elsewhere were Kel'el Ware (Oregon to Indiana), Dalton Knecht (Northern Colorado to Tennessee), Jaylon Tyson (Texas Tech to Cal), Terrence Shannon Jr. (Texas Tech to Illinois) and Baylor Scheierman (South Dakota State to Creighton).The 2026 NBA Draft is expected to be among the best and deepest classes in recent memory. However, with Quaintance returning before the calendar flips to 2026, he has a chance to separate himself and show why he is one of the true blue-chip prospects in the draft.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        It has been seven weeks since the World Series ended and so far only three of our top 10 free agents have signed and two of our top 25 trade candidates have been moved. A slow offseason, this has been, though we did get a three-team trade Friday. Perhaps that's a sign the hot stove is about to heat up. Here now are Saturday's rumors. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Pirates hope to add another batEven after picking up Brandon Lowe, the Pirates hope to add what GM Ben Cherington called a \"proven bat,\" according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Third base and DH could use an upgrade, possibly left field as well. Really, everything should be on the table after the Pirates scored the fewest runs and hit the fewest home runs in baseball in 2025.FanGraphs estimates the club's 2026 payroll at $82 million, including arbitration projections. It was $87 million in 2025. If they hold steady at the same payroll level next year, there's not much room to spend. The Pirates have signaled a willingness to spend big this offseason (their Kyle Schwarber pursuit, etc.), so perhaps Cherington & Co. still have plenty of financial wiggle room.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     \tPhillies pursuing catcher trades As talks with free agent J.T. Realmuto have failed to progress, the Phillies have begun to explore the trade market for a catcher, reports The Athletic. Philadelphia is said to have an offer on the table for Realmuto. Ultimately, a reunion makes sense for both sides, but a deal hasn't come together yet, so the Phillies are exploring their options. \nThe best free agent catcher behind Realmuto is Victor Caratini, who plays first base and DH as much as he catches these days. As for the trade market, Twins backstop Ryan Jeffers is an obvious candidate to be moved. He's a year away from free agency and the Twins sold hard at this summer's trade deadline. We ranked Realmuto as the 13th best free agent available this offseason. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Orioles interested in Romero \nThe Orioles are among the teams with interest in Cardinals lefty reliever JoJo Romero, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Romero is a year away from free agency and thus an obvious trade candidate with the Cardinals not prioritizing contention in 2026. The O's have already added righties Ryan Helsley and Andrew Kittredge to their bullpen this offseason. \nRomero, 29, is a sinker specialist with a knack for limiting homers. Baltimore has two lefties, Keegan Akin and Dietrich Enns, in their bullpen, though neither is a late-inning matchup specialist. A quality lefty reliever is a necessity in the AL East, which houses quality lefty bats Roman Anthony, Jonathan Aranda, Jazz Chisholm Jr., Jarren Duran, Ben Rice, Daulton Varsho, and others. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Welcome to NFL Week 16, where the Denver Broncos look to keep their 11-game win streak alive against the feisty Jacksonville Jaguars, the New England Patriots will attempt to rebound against the Baltimore Ravens and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers will try to create some separation from the Carolina Panthers in the NFC South. Who's scoring today? That's what everyone wants to know. Whether you're crafting the group-chat parlay or looking for a lesser-known name with some value, anytime TD bets have become one of the most popular wagers in the world of sports gambling. Below, we will break down five anytime TD bets to consider for Week 16. These will not be predictable choices like a Derrick Henry or Jonathan Taylor score, but they won't be wild long shots such as a team defense. Let's begin with the important matchup going down in Charlotte. Odds courtesy of DraftKings Sportsbook1. RB Bucky Irving, Tampa Bay Buccaneers (+150)\nThe Buccaneers' RB1 has registered three straight games with at least 70 scrimmage yards since returning from injury, and scored two touchdowns in those three games. Carolina has an average run defense in terms of yards allowed per game (116.0), but opposing RB1s have scored touchdowns in four straight games vs. the Panthers. \n2. RB James Cook, Buffalo Bills (-135)\nJuicy, but for good reason. Not only does James Cook rank second in the NFL with 1,415 rushing yards, but this Cleveland Browns run defense has been pretty bad as of late. They allowed Tony Pollard to explode for a career-high 161 yards and two touchdowns a couple weeks ago, then D'Andre Swift rushed for 98 yards and two touchdowns last week. Make it a parlay leg.3. WR Amon-Ra St. Brown, Detroit Lions (-115)\nAmon-Ra St. Brown is six receptions away from becoming the fifth player in NFL history to begin a career with four straight 100 reception seasons. He has also recorded three straight seasons with double-digit touchdowns. Last week against the Los Angeles Rams, St. Brown caught 13 of 18 targets for 164 yards and two touchdowns, but that's not why I'm picking him to find the end zone on Sunday. I'm taking St. Brown to score because the Pittsburgh Steelers have the sixth-worst pass defense in the NFL, and the Lions are fighting for their playoff lives.4. TE Travis Kelce, Kansas City Chiefs (+195)\nAn NFL legend is likely playing his final few games, and will have to do so without quarterback Patrick Mahomes. Still, I expect Travis Kelce to be a big target for Gardner Minshew. Especially when you consider that Rashee Rice and Tyquan Thornton won't be on the field this Sunday. The Tennessee Titans are extremely short-handed in the secondary, which allowed Brock Purdy to easily throw for 295 yards and three touchdowns last week. His tight end, George Kittle, caught eight passes for 88 yards and a touchdown vs. the Titans. I'm not expecting Kelce to put up those kinds of numbers, but I do have him catching a touchdown in the red zone. \n5. WR Stefon Diggs, New England Patriots (+200)\nHere's a bit of a calculated long shot. Diggs hasn't caught a touchdown since Nov. 9, and has been held under 30 receiving yards in his last three outings. In fact, he hasn't played more than 50% of offensive snaps in any of the last three games. With the Patriots suffering their first loss in 11 games last week, maybe that leads Josh McDaniels to involve Diggs a bit more against Baltimore. \n            ",

Backed by Nike founder Phil Knight, the Ducks bring a deep, well-funded roster that weathered a wave of offensive injuries to secure a coveted home game.Traveling three time zones west is a James Madison program in just its fourth season at the FBS level. The Dukes (12-1) operate with only a fraction of Oregon's payroll, but they earned their place in the field by finishing as the fifth-highest-ranked conference champion following a 31-14 win over Troy in the Sun Belt Championship Game.Competing on the road against one of college football's premier brands is a daunting task. Still, James Madison will not lack confidence. The Dukes famously scored 70 points in a road win at North Carolina last season and held a second-half lead at Louisville in Week 2 before fading late.\nGiven the stakes, a James Madison victory would rank among the most significant upsets in college football history. Pulling it off, however, will require knocking off a supremely talented Oregon team. The winner advances to face No. 4 Texas Tech in the Orange Bowl on New Year's Day.Where to watch Oregon vs. James Madison liveDate: Saturday, Dec. 20 | Time: 7 p.m. ETLocation: Autzen Stadium -- Eugene, OregonTV: TNT | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)Oregon vs. James Madison: Need to know  Oregon's hobbled receiver room: There is hope for Oregon's hobbled receiver room. Premier targets Gary Bryant Jr. and Dakorien Moore both participated, at least to some extent, in practice this week. So did receiver Evan Stewart, who hasn't played all season because of a knee injury. Bryant hasn't played since Nov. 8, and Moore hasn't played since Oct. 25. As a result, the Ducks have been reaching deep into their depth chart, and quarterback Dante Moore has been leaning heavily on tight end Kenyon Sadiq. But reinforcements appear to be coming.\nJames Madison's mobile threat: James Madison quarterback Alonza Barnett III has rushed for 14 touchdowns this season and totaled 544 yards on the ground while establishing himself as one of the nation's top dual-threat quarterbacks. Among quarterbacks in the CFP, only Tulane's Jake Retzlaff has run for more touchdowns (16). But Barnett is plenty skilled as a passer, too. His dynamic skillset will pose a challenge to Oregon's defense. However, the Ducks were successful in defending similarly talented Washington quarterback Demond Williams in a season-ending rivalry victory.Coaching exodus: Many of the key coaches in this game have already been introduced as head coaches at new schools for the 2026 season and are pulling double-duty during the playoff. James Madison head coach Bob Chesney will soon be off to UCLA, Oregon offensive coordinator Will Stein is taking over at Kentucky and Ducks defensive coordinator Tosh Lupoi is headed to Cal. Though they've been pulled in different directions during the buildup to the CFP, all three will be dialed in to their 2025 teams on Saturday.\"I would feel like a complete fraud if I left these guys throughout this playoff run and this opportunity in front of us to coach in Autzen another time,\" Stein said. \"Honestly, it'd be crazy. Tosh is the same way. We've poured so much of our lives, so much of our time, our families' time into this team and into this program. Coach Lanning gave me an opportunity … so the last thing I'd ever do would be to leave these players.\"\n  Oregon vs. James Madison prediction, pick\nAfter earning the No. 1 seed and a first-round bye in last year's CFP and taking a 41-21 loss to Ohio State in the quarterfinals, Oregon will be motivated for redemption. With weeks to prepare for James Madison and to rehabilitate key injured playmakers, the Ducks have no excuse not to dominate. Oregon is more athletic and skilled at every position and has home-field advantage in its corner. Barring catastrophic turnover issues or other self-inflicted mistakes, the Ducks should cruise past a good JMU that faces a significant talent disparity. Pick: Oregon -20.5Who will win and cover in each college football bowl and playoff game?

    "body": "\n        The quarterfinals of the College Football Playoff are upon us, which means the four top seeds will finally get their postseason campaigns underway after a lengthy break following conference championship weekend.No. 4 Texas Tech waited the longest to officially learn its quarterfinal opponent. But given that No. 5 Oregon entered the first round as a three-touchdown favorite over No. 12 James Madison, the Red Raiders likely got a head start preparing for the Ducks. Despite a spirited effort from the Dukes, Oregon overwhelmed the Sun Belt champions to set up the expected Orange Bowl showdown with Texas Tech -- a matchup that could be one of the best games of the entire Playoff.There's a fitting symmetry to the pairing. Oregon, once college football's \"new money\" program, will face the NIL era's fastest riser in Texas Tech. The Ducks have established themselves as a consistent national contender over the past two decades, while the Red Raiders poured major resources into their program and surged to the top of the Big 12 this season as a result.In many ways, Oregon represents a blueprint for how a program like Texas Tech can build sustained excellence. On New Year's Day in Miami, the Red Raiders will get a chance to show they've already closed that gap.\nFor two programs long defined by high-powered offenses, the defining trait of this season has been dominant defense. Both teams have been excellent offensively -- they're both top 10 nationally in scoring -- but their defenses have been the engines of their success. As a result, both offenses will face a significant challenge trying to move the ball consistently in this matchup.\n    \n                                        \n    What to know about Texas TechThe Red Raiders earned the No. 4 seed by riding one of the nation's best defenses to a dominant season in the Big 12. Aside from a midseason stumble at Arizona State, Texas Tech bullied its way through the conference, including a pair of blowout wins over BYU that cemented a top-four finish in the CFP rankings and secured a first-round bye.Texas Tech's defense ranks among the elite nationally, finishing third in scoring defense at 10.9 points allowed per game — trailing only top seeds Indiana and Ohio State. All four of the Red Raiders' AP All-America selections came on the defensive side of the ball, including first-team honors for linebacker Jacob Rodriguez and EDGE David Bailey.\nThat star-studded unit will be tasked with slowing an Oregon offense that found its rhythm in the second half of the season and finished ninth nationally in scoring at 38.2 points per game. When the Ducks have the ball, it will be a true strength-on-strength battle. Oregon ranked 14th in rushing offense at 218.4 yards per game, while Texas Tech finished No. 1 nationally in rushing defense, allowing just 68.5 yards per game.Oregon faced two other top-10 defenses in 2025 and failed to crack 21 points against either -- scoring 18 in a win over Iowa and 20 in a loss to Indiana. The Iowa game was played in a downpour, but Indiana held the Ducks to 81 rushing yards on 30 carries. Expect Texas Tech to study that film closely in hopes of replicating what the Hoosiers did up front with their own ultra-talented front seven.The biggest question for Texas Tech is whether its No. 2 scoring offense can hold up against Oregon's stout defense. The Red Raiders overwhelmed the Big 12, but in their biggest games -- against Utah and BYU twice -- the defense led the way. Oregon represents another step up in competition, and Behren Morton, Cameron Dickey and the rest of the offense will need to bring their A-game.\n\n    \n                                        \n    What to know about OregonThe Ducks did what was expected in a convincing first-round win at home, overpowering James Madison to set up a heavyweight clash in the Orange Bowl.The challenge for Oregon will be creating space for its playmakers against a hard-hitting Texas Tech defense. Against James Madison, the Ducks enjoyed a clear speed advantage and exploited it throughout the game. The margins will be far tighter against the Red Raiders.Oregon typically sets up the pass with the run, but that approach may be flipped against Texas Tech. Quarterback Dante Moore could be asked to shoulder more of the load early, using the passing game to loosen the Red Raiders' front and open opportunities on the ground.\nSaturday night's game against James Madison saw Oregon get almost anything it wanted offensively. That will not be the case on Jan. 1, but Moore looked sharp throwing the ball. His confidence and willingness to push it downfield will be critical if the Ducks' offense is going to have success against Texas Tech.Defensively, the question is whether Oregon can create negative plays to knock Texas Tech off schedule. The Red Raiders would prefer to lean on the run game and avoid putting too much on quarterback Behren Morton. Despite a strong overall defensive season, Oregon ranked near the bottom nationally in havoc metrics, finishing with 57 tackles for loss (113th in FBS) and 23 sacks (81st).Texas Tech's offense stalled early at times against Utah and BYU, largely due to backfield pressure. While both defenses eventually wore down after spending extended time on the field, the blueprint for slowing the Red Raiders is clear: generate pressure and speed up Morton's decision-making.\nOregon has been steady defensively all season, but it may need to be more creative in manufacturing the disruption necessary to give Texas Tech problems.Odds below via FanDuel Sportsbook.Orange Bowl odds, prediction I expect a highly competitive game in Miami between the Red Raiders and Ducks as I think there are a lot of similarities between these two teams. Both defenses are excellent and when at their best, the offenses can put up points in bunches. To me this game comes down to which offense can create more explosive plays in a variety of ways, because both defenses are so talented and so good at adapting in-game. I give the Ducks the edge in that department thanks to Moore and see him leading Oregon to a bit of quarterfinal revenge after last year's dud in the Rose Bowl. PICK: Oregon -1.5\n            ",

And that's why unless North Carolina's Caleb Wilson does something to make us reconsider which five-star freshmen will be the ACC Player of the Year, or unless Ohio State's Bruce Thornton goes big in an upset, the story coming out of Saturday's CBS Sports Classic will likely be whichever team loses the first game of the doubleheader here inside State Farm Arena.St. John's or Kentucky?Who takes it? Who doesn't?The victor will add a Quadrant-1 win to the resume while the loser watches its fanbase meltdown again following another defeat. Fun times. Either way, the expectation is that Jayden Quaintance will make his debut for UK after missing the first 11 games while recovering from an ACL tear suffered last season while playing at Arizona State.He could be a real difference-maker.Quaintance, a 6-foot-9 forward, is slotted 11th in Kyle Boone's latest 2026 NBA Mock Draft thanks in part to a 7-foot-5 wingspan that allows him to block and alter shots at a high rate. His block-percentage last season was 9.8, which ranked 11th nationally, according to KenPom.com. Quaintance's presence alone should change how St. John's tries to attack UK's defense.\n        \n            \n                College basketball picks, schedule: Predictions for Duke vs. Texas Tech, more top 25 games\n                \n                    Kyle Boone                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSt. John's is No. 21 in Saturday morning's updated CBS Sports Top 25 And 1 daily college basketball rankings, where Michigan remains No. 1 for the 11th straight day.

    "body": "\n        LONDON -- For Alexander Isak, this really might have been the moment where it all went click. Not that the 10 minutes leading up to his goal had particularly suggested that British football's record signing was on the brink of something, but there is nothing to drag a player out of a prolonged funk like a goal. All the more so given that his goal dragged Liverpool ahead in a game that they resolutely failed to impose themselves on, no matter the difficulties of Tottenham.These were the moments that you pay $175 million. They have been altogether too infrequent for Liverpool, 2-1 winners at Tottenham.Cruelly for Isak, however, they might not be much more frequent for some time yet. It was the other click that threatens to define this day. Or perhaps it was a jar, a jam or something even more heavy-duty. Whatever the nature of the damage done to Isak as Micky van de Ven collided with him well after the shot was away, it was enough to rob Liverpool's No. 9 of what might otherwise have been a moment of ecstasy. There was to be no celebration from Isak nor from his teammates. Dark and worried faces soon surrounded the Swede, who squirmed on the floor in agony, one hand covering his eyes as the other clung onto his left knee. He seemed to fear the worst.A stretcher may not have been required, but the worst fears hardly seemed allayed as Isak hobbled along the touchline at agonizing pace, his weight placed on two Liverpool physios. Suddenly, all manner of fears came crashing into view. When might Isak be back to fire life into year one at his new club? Isn't this what any buyer would always have feared from a player whose Newcastle career was pockmarked with runs of seven or eight games on the sidelines? What of the World Cup and, indeed, the qualifiers in March, where Sweden could really do with one of the best strikers in the world? That's what knee injuries do. For all the advances in rehabilitation and recovery, they are still the ones that have you fearing the worst.\nFor Arne Slot, it was much too soon for such doomerism, though he admitted that his gut feeling was not a positive one. \"I don't have any news on him,\" he said. \"If a player scores and gets injured and doesn't come on the pitch and also doesn't try ... That's usually not a good thing. I cannot say anything more than that. That is just gut feeling. Nothing medical.\"I haven't spoken to him about his feeling but it's a nice thing that he scored. A good goal, assisted by Florian Wirtz.\"Slot might be intent on finding the silver lining but the story of this season seems to be that, no matter how much they spend, Liverpool cannot have nice things. Not for the first time this season, a moment of triumph was swept away in an instant. So too departed a flicker of what Slot's team might have been given more time to build the automatisms they so clearly lack.\nIsak's goal had been the moment the rest of the Premier League had feared since Martin Edwards parked the Brink's truck outside St. James' Park and came up with an offer even Saudi Arabia couldn't refuse. One clumsy moment from Cristian Romero -- the first of many -- and the ball was ricocheting off Alexis Mac Allister and into Isak's path. Smart hold-up play with his back to goal and then the No. 9 slipped the ball to Hugo Ekitike, whose first-time pass found Wirtz in stride. That long-awaited first goal contribution betrayed no nerves, a pass played at just the right moment for Isak to bend one low and across Guglielmo Vicario.\"That's what we would like to see happening a lot,\" said Slot. \"Good finish, good pass. Let's not be too negative yet. We don't know. Let's hope he's back with us soon. Difficult to say.\"This may feel like an overhype of an attack that was as much to do with how little else Liverpool offered in an attacking sense. A header from Ekitike 10 minutes after the opener gave them enough of a cushion to hold off a late charge but against 11, 10 or nine men, Liverpool never got going. It was one thing to get outshot five to one by Spurs in the period before Xavi Simons' red card; Tottenham controlled the game rather well early on. The fact that it was 10 to seven in Tottenham's favor from then on speaks as much to Liverpool's inability to exploit possession and territory as it does the late charge brought about by Richarlison's scrappy finish seven minutes from time. \nLiverpool found themselves clinging on against nine men at the death partly because football is a deeply silly sport for how low-scoring it is, somewhat because the decisions of referee John Brooks stoked an indignation in Tottenham that was worth at least one extra man and predominantly because they could not do enough with the ball. This isn't the first time they've found themselves hanging on against 10 men -- against Newcastle, they roared back in more thrilling fashion -- and it seems there is something that Slot is aware of that is making it harder for Liverpool to impose themselves on teams.\"It's always difficult. If I try to explain why it is difficult then people tell me afterwards, 'you say too much to your future opponents.'\"When we had the ball, that was what hurt me the most. In the nine minutes of added time, I think they had 95% of the ball. Every time when we had the ball, we kicked it away or we threw it away. It was unbelievable that we couldn't keep the ball a bit longer.\"\nThat feels like another problem on top of the other one that has dogged Slot for most of this season: that his team are too easily run through by counterattacking opponents. There were flashes of that, a breakaway chance for 10-man Randal Kolo Muani, but until the late drama, this had more of the feel of the Inter game, a match where Liverpool filled the center to throttle some of the drama out of proceedings. The logic to that should be that when indiscipline from the opponents allows them to apply further control, they turn that into shots and goals.Instead, the quasi-diamond of recent games was more of a lump of coal, all rough edges as Mac Allister found himself pushed up alongside Ekitike, Wirtz roaming high and low in pursuit of the ball. For this system to be effective, the fullbacks need to be at the top of their game. Conor Bradley was struggling with his radar before his injury-enforced exit at the interval and too many of Milos Kerkez's crosses crashed into the first Tottenham shirt. The left flank in particular never got going and inverting into more central areas does not seem to be the best use of Kerkez, a flyer down the line who could offer the width this team lacks too often.Such are the problems Liverpool made for themselves with their half-billion dollar overhaul of the champions, one which seems to have left them light on wingers and center backs while overstuffed with players who would be happiest in the space between midfield and the frontline. This might be a squad that needs reorienting but when you have as much talent as Slot can call upon, there is always the prospect of something clicking. Not that, however.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Texas Tech entered this season believing it had the pieces to win a national championship, but so far, its defense had not been up to par and injuries have ravaged the Red Raiders' ability to coalesce. Texas Tech entered Saturday's showdown against No. 3 Duke short-handed, bruised and off-kilter.It will leave Madison Square Garden with one of college basketball's biggest wins of the season. Texas Tech erased a 17-point, second-half deficit to stun Duke 82-81 and notch a resume-boosting win that sends a message to the rest of the Big 12 that this group is as dangerous as ever. JT Toppin played the final 11-plus minutes of the game with four fouls and managed to stay in the fight. The Red Raiders' All-American finished with 19 points, but it was Christian Anderson who sored 23 of his 27 points in the second half points to spark the comeback. LeJuan Watts also chipped in 20 massive points to help Texas Tech (9-3) stay above water without injured center Luke Bamgboye.Duke (11-1) got 23 points from Cameron Boozer and 13 more from twin brother Cayden, but the Blue Devils' offense scored just three points in a five-minute span down the stretch to breathe life into Texas Tech's rally.\nWith the loss, Duke fell from the unbeaten ranks. Only Michigan, Iowa State, Arizona, Vanderbilt, Nebraska and Miami (Ohio) remain unblemished.    Let's dive into some takeaways of Texas Tech's upset of Duke.Texas Tech's Big Three emergesWe knew Toppin and Anderson were expected to be brilliant, and so far, that duo has been up to the task. Saturday was no different. One of the nation's best inside-out duos combined for 46 points against a Duke defense that had been vicious all year. But Watts has become a revelation offensively in recent weeks after focusing exclusively on … his defense? The basketball Gods have blessed Texas Tech's bootyball machine, who racked up 20 points, six rebounds and three dimes in 27 minutes against the Blue Devils.\nWhen Toppin, Anderson and Watts are cooking, Texas Tech's offense is an incredibly tough cover.Duke learned that the hard way.Duke's defense disintegrates at the wrong timeDuke's defense picked a brutal time to play its worst defensive half of the season. The Blue Devils allowed 1.48 points per possession in the second half. Overall, it was the worst showing for Duke's defense this year … by a country mile.\nTexas: 0.90Michigan State: 0.93Kansas: 1.00Arkansas: 1.01Florida: 1.01Texas Tech: 1.16Big 12 race is shaping up to be a bangerTexas Tech has certainly proven its best 40 minutes can knock off anybody, and it's setting the stage for an all-time Big 12 race. Iowa State and Arizona are unbelievable. Houston, fresh off dismantling Arkansas, is starting to play very well. BYU and Kansas have two elite talents. A bloodbath awaits.\n            ",

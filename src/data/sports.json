    "body": "\n        Teams hoping to finally put together a winning streak will meet on 'Monday Night Football' as the San Francisco 49ers host the Carolina Panthers. San Fran (7-4) has alternated wins and losses over its last nine games and is coming off a 41-22 victory over Arizona in Week 11. Carolina (6-5) has alternated wins and losses over its last five contests, most recently knocking off Atlanta, 30-27 in overtime, on Sunday. The Niners have gotten several key pieces back in the lineup in recent weeks with quarterback Brock Purdy, receivers Ricky Pearsall, Jauan Jennings, tight end George Kittle and offensive tackle Trent Williams all available despite dealing with injuries earlier this season. Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif. San Francisco is the 7-point favorite in the latest Panthers vs. 49ers odds, while the over/under for total points scored is 49.5 up two points from the opening 'MNF' line.

Carolina has covered in five of six games versus NFC opponents in 2025, and its MNF opponent has major defensive holes. The Niners can neither get to the quarterback nor take the ball away as they rank last in defensive sacks and also have the second-fewest picks. That should bring comfort to Young in the pocket, while he also has the league's No. 4 rusher in Rico Dowdle to lean on. Finally, there doesn't appear to be much of a home-field advantage for the 49ers who have eight giveaways versus just one takeaway at Levi's Stadium this year. See which team to back at SportsLine.New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states:Why the 49ers can coverA finally healthy Purdy showed what San Francisco is capable of last week as the Niners scored a season-high of 41 points after averaging just 22 on the season. The offense, however, runs through Christian McCaffrey, who leads the NFL in scrimmage yards and is on pace for 1,000-yard seasons both on the ground and through the air. Kittle has also made an impact since coming off IR, with four scores over his last four games, and San won't see the most threatening of offenses come Monday. Carolina ranks 28th in scoring, with additional bottom-10 marks in passing offense, third down offense and yards per play. See which team to back at SportsLine. Check out the latest BetMGM promo code CBSSPORTS, where new users can get up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses.How to make 49ers vs. Panthers   picksFor Panthers vs. 49ers   on 'Monday Night Football,' the model is leaning Over the total, projecting 52 combined points.

The 49ers are 7.5-point favorites after a 19-point win over the Cardinals last week, and with that, the SportsLine Projection Model has San Francisco covering the 7.5-point spread as one of its Monday best bets at DraftKings. The 49ers are 3-2 over their last five games, and each of the three wins came by at least 10 points. The over/under for 49ers vs. Panthers is 49.5 points, up two from the opening line. The model is also backing the Phoenix Suns as 6.5-point underdogs to cover against the Houston Rockets in NBA action, and one of SportsLine's top experts has a pick on No. 13 Gonzaga vs. No. 11 Alabama at the Players Era Festival in college basketball action to include in Monday best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins, plus 3 months of NBA League Pass free: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

Last week, with Brock Purdy, Christian McCaffrey, George Kittle, Ricky Pearsall and Jauan Jennings all on the field together, San Francisco put up 41 points against the Cardinals. Purdy had three touchdown passes, and McCaffrey scored three times (twice rushing). Although the Panthers are 6-5 this season, they rank 28th in scoring at 18.8 points per game. Their limited offensive upside may struggle to keep pace with the 49ers, as the model projects San Francisco to cover the spread in 56% of simulations. Back the 49ers at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Suns (+6.5) vs. Rockets (-108)The Rockets travel to Phoenix on Monday, and they'll be without Kevin Durant, who is out for personal reasons, for what was supposed to be the future Hall of Famer's return to Phoenix. While the Rockets won't have the star they received in that trade, the Suns will have one of the key returns with Dillon Brooks getting the chance at some revenge against his former team. Brooks is averaging 21.4 ppg, forming a strong duo with Devin Booker, who is averaging 26.9 ppg this season. The Suns enter on a three-game winning streak and are 8-1 over their last nine games. Given their recent play and Durant being out, the model views 6.5 as too many points to give Phoenix, projecting the Suns to cover the spread in 68% of simulations. Back the Suns at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Alabama (+4.5) vs. Gonzaga (-115)Alabama takes on Gonzaga at the Players Era Festival in Las Vegas, with the Crimson Tide coming off a 90-86 win over No. 8 Illinois on Wednesday at a neutral site. \"I actually make Alabama the small favorite here,\" SportsLine expert Thomas Casale said. \"I'll take the 4.5 in a run-and-gun game that the Tide love to play.

    "body": "\n        The NBA trade deadline isn't until Feb. 5, but with a month of the season in the books, team's are starting to assess what moves they want to make. There could be several big names on the trading block, but it's still too early for anything substantial to happen. But that hasn't stopped the rumor mill from churning before we've even reached Thanksgiving.But that's the nature of the NBA nowadays, things move fast and you have to get a jumpstart on the trade market if you want to make championship moves or changes that can position you better for the draft. With that in mind, here's the latest rumors circulating around the NBA.Clippers interested in DeMar DeRozanAn upcoming fire sale appears to be on the books for the Sacramento Kings, and teams are starting to set their sights on some players who could be available. DeMar DeRozan is drawing some interest from the Clippers, according to The Athletic's Sam Amick, in part because of his partially guaranteed contract for next season that could pay him only $10 million of a $27 million deal. The Clippers have struggled through the first month of the season with a 5-12 record, and have an offense that ranks 21st in the league.DeRozan's scoring would certainly help L.A., but at 36 years old it would only make the Clippers an even older roster that is already relying too much on veterans in a fast-paced NBA landscape. DeRozan has also never been a quality defender, and the Clippers' defense is undoubtedly a bigger issue that needs solving right now.Mavericks will have a difficult time trading Anthony DavisThe moment Nico Harrison was fired, Davis became a trade chip. The issue, though, is that he hasn't played since Oct. 29 as he's been dealing with a calf strain. And when Davis was healthy, he appeared out of shape and struggled defensively. So it's no surprise that those around the league think the Mavericks will have a hard time trying to trade Davis whose injury history is a red flag for opposing teams. ESPN's Tim Bontemps is reporting that Davis' injuries and his contract, which pays him $54.1 million, $58.4 million and $62.7 million over the next three seasons, are why there have not been very many suitors for the veteran forward. \nIf Davis, 32, manages to come back and show a sustained level of success without injury, then that could change. But this situation appears to be something that will drag out closer to the trade deadline.LaMelo Ball trade talk is premature, but doesn't mean it won't happenHeads started to turn when it was reported by Yahoo Sports' Kelly Iko that Ball was growing disgruntled with the direction of the Hornets and that he would be open to a trade. Ball shot down those rumors, but that doesn't mean a trade won't happen, either initiated by Charlotte or Ball. Jake Fischer is reporting that while talks of Ball getting traded are premature, it's something the Hornets could explore ahead of the deadline.Ball, 24, comes with his own red flags, primarily his continuous ankle injuries that have allowed him to play only 20 games more than Zion Williamson over his career. But amongst the big names mentioned, Ball certainly has the most trade value given his age, talent and a contract that isn't completely egregious.\nGrizzlies will explore Ja Morant trade marketMorant recently said he has lost his joy for playing basketball, he's been suspended a game for conduct detrimental to the team and the Grizzlies are 6-11. He's currently sidelined with a calf strain, but even when healthy, the 26-year-old is averaging near a career low across the board, and still hasn't been able to improve as a shooter. Combine that with the off-court issues he's had over the years and it creates a situation where he might be more trouble than he's worth for the Grizzlies. Bontemps reports that Memphis will explore the trade market, but it won't be an easy sell to find a package worth considering. That's not surprising given everything I just cited above, and who knows, maybe the Grizzlies turn things around and these trade rumors fizzle out. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Everyone wants to be in business with Caitlin Clark, even NBA superstars like Stephen Curry. According to a new report from Bloomberg, Under Armour's inability to sign Clark played a role in Curry's long-term relationship with the brand deteriorating before ultimately ending earlier this month. Curry had been with Under Armour since 2013, prior to his ascension to the top of the sport, but the two sides parted ways earlier this month. Curry's standalone venture, \"Curry Brand,\" will continue independently, and, as a sneaker free agent, he is free to wear other brands. \"Under Armour believed in me early in my career and gave me the space to build something much bigger and more impactful than a shoe,\" Curry said in a press release. \"I'll always be grateful for that.\"While Under Armour believed in Curry earlier than most, the Warriors star and his camp had grown \"frustrated\" with the company in recent years. Via Bloomberg:\nCurry and his advisers became frustrated by what they viewed as underinvestment in the brand, according to people familiar with the situation who asked to not be identified because details of the relationship are private. Meanwhile, the division's sales weren't meeting the company's or Curry's expectations, the people said.Part of Curry's frustration reportedly stemmed from Under Armour's failed attempt to sign Clark when the women's basketball phenom was on the market early last year. Clark ultimately signed an eight-year, $28 million deal with Nike, which included a signature shoe. Here's Bloomberg again:One sore point for Curry was the attempt last year to recruit Caitlin Clark to join his brand, according to people familiar with the matter. He and the company pursued the phenom, but Under Armour's offer trailed the total value of Nike's pitch, the people said. Clark, now a star in the WNBA, opted to sign with Nike.After Clark signed with Nike, The Wall Street Journal reported the respective offers she received at the time. While Under Armour's offer was better on a per-year basis, it was significantly shorter than Nike's offer. Caitlin Clark's reported shoe deal offersCompanyOfferNike8 years, $28 millionUnder Armour4 years, $16 million Adidas4 years, $6 millionPumaWalked awayIn August, Nike made Clark a \"Signature Athlete,\" introduced her unique logo and confirmed that her first signature shoe will be released in 2026. Sneaker insider and expert Nick DePaula told Front Office Sports that the shoe could be worth over $100 million to Nike. However much Nike ends up making on Clark's shoe, it will be far more than the $28 million they gave her -- nevermind what they make on merchandise and Clark's \"Player Edition\" shoes. \nUnder Armour's decision to not do whatever it took to sign Clark -- one of the most popular athletes in America with a rabid fanbase -- seemed short-sighted at the time. It only looks worse now that Curry has walked as well. \n            ",

It will be Burrow's first game in nearly three months. Bengals coach Zac Taylor said on Monday that he anticipates Burrow playing for the first time since he underwent surgery following a Grade 3 turf toe injury that was sustained back in Week 2. Burrow returned to practice two weeks ago in a limited capacity and was a full practice participant during the Bengals' first two practices last week. Burrow also spoke on his status for Thursday night by posting an old image of himself wearing a LeBron James jersey on social media with the caption, \"He's back.\" Burrow himself said two weeks ago that playing in Baltimore would be \"very\" significant for him. Baltimore is where Burrow's season ended prematurely two years ago after he suffered a wrist injury that ultimately required surgery. \nThe top overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft, Burrow led the Bengals to the Super Bowl in 2021, his first full season as the team's starting quarterback. He led Cincinnati to within a game of the Super Bowl the following season while garnering serious MVP consideration. Last year, Burrow won NFL Comeback Player of the Year for a second time after leading the NFL with 4,918 yards and 43 touchdowns. \nCincinnati (3-8) has won just one game since Burrow injured his toe during the team's win over the Jaguars. But despite his team's bleak playoff prospects, Burrow clearly feels compelled to play this season as long as he is physically able to do so, starting with Thursday night's game against the Ravens. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The San Francisco 49ers are hosting the Carolina Panthers In the Week 12 edition of \"Monday Night Football'' with San Francisco coming off a blowout victory over the division rival Arizona Cardinals, having improved to 7-4 with the win. The Niners have alternated wins and losses every week since starting the season 3-0, and they'll be looking to break that streak and keep pace in the NFC West division race with a victory over Carolina on Monday night.Carolina secured an overtime victory over the division rival Atlanta Falcons last week to improve to 6-5. After the Tampa Bay Buccaneers lost on Sunday night, the Panthers now have a chance to take over sole possession of first place in the NFC South, which they can capture with a win on Monday.Which of these two teams will make it back-to-back victories? We'll find out soon enough. But before we break down the matchup, here's a look at how you can watch the game.LIVE updates: Follow along with all the action as the 49ers battle the Panthers on \"Monday Night Football.\"\nWhere to watch 49ers vs. Panthers liveDate: Monday, Nov. 14 | Time: 8:15 p.m. ETLocation: Levi's Stadium (Santa Clara, California)TV: ESPN/ABC | Stream: Fubo (Try for free) Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: 49ers -7.5, O/U 49.5 via DraftKings SportsbookWhen the Panthers have the ballCarolina is coming off an unusual offensive game wherein it did not run the ball particularly well but absolutely exploded in the passing game. The Panthers ran for just 67 yards last week against the Falcons, but Bryce Young went an incredible 31 of 45 for 448 yards and three touchdowns. The 49ers, meanwhile, played a very similar game against the Arizona offense to the one Carolina played against Atlanta's defense: San Francisco held the Cardinals to just 36 yards rushing (on 14 carries) but allowed 452 passing yards as Jacoby Brissett set the NFL record for completions in a game. So, the question here is whether we are treated to a repeat performance on either end of the field. It's worth noting that the Falcons game alone accounts for 22.8% of Young's passing yards for the season -- and he's played in 10 of the team's 11 games. The Panthers want the run game to be the center of their attack, and they're probably not going to go overly pass-heavy unless they're forced into it. \nThe San Francisco defense is banged up all over the place, with Nick Bosa, Fred Warner, Mykel Williams and Yetur Gross-Matos all on injured reserve and even guys like Tatum Bethune and Robert Beal Jr. either doubtful (Beal) or out (Bethune). Even Luke Gifford, who could be asked to fill in for Bethune at linebacker, is listed as questionable. And they'll be counting on guys like Keion White, Sam Okuayinonu and Clelin Ferrell on the edge alongside Bryce Huff.The Niners have been slightly better against the run (22nd in success rate) than they have been against the pass (26th), but they haven't been particularly good against either. Obviously, a lot of that is owed to their various injuries; but those guys won't be back for this game. The Panthers should be able to find some success running the ball downhill with Rico Dowdle, and take the pressure off Young to carry the offense. If and when Young does drop back, it would be surprising if Deommodore Lenoir follows Tetairoa McMillan around the field. Lenoir has lined up at left cornerback on all 624 snaps that he's played on the perimeter, according to Pro Football Focus, so the Panthers can generate a better matchup by having T-Mac line up across from Renardo Green if they want. Green's no slouch, but Lenoir is the team's best corner. Young's other weapons aren't much to write home about.\nWhen the 49ers have the ballBrock Purdy returned last week for San Francisco and immediately showed why there was never any controversy about who was going to be the team's starting quarterback, despite Mac Jones having had some success when under center in his place. Purdy went 19 of 26 for 200 yards and three touchdowns, beautifully layering the ball all over the field and spreading it around to the likes of Christian McCaffrey, George Kittle and Jauan Jennings. McCaffrey even had one of his more successful games of the season on the ground, rushing 13 times for 81 yards and two touchdowns, and you could see how much more open space he had to run with a greater threat of the downfield passing attack available to San Francisco.The Niners are still going to build the plane around a lot of touches for CMC, who is averaging 24.3 rushes plus receptions per game so far this year. There will be a ton of pressure on Carolina's linebackers and safeties to deal with him in space, and honestly, there just aren't many players at those positions who are equipped to do so -- especially when the players at those same positions also have to worry about getting beaten by Kittle over the middle or up the seam. \nIt doesn't help that Carolina will be without both Trevin Wallace and Christian Rozeboom, robbing the Panthers of both of their starting inside linebackers. Guys like Claudin Cherelus, Maema Njongmeta and possibly Bam Martin-Scott will have to play bigger roles, while there will be even more pressure on the likes of Trevon Moehrig Nick Scott and potential slot corner Corey Thornton to deal with those two demons as well.It'll be interesting to see if the Panthers use Jaycee Horn to shadow a receiver, and if so, whether it's Jennings or Ricky Pearsall, who looked like the top perimeter option earlier in the year before getting injured and missing extended time. The Niners don't have a true No. 1 wideout, so there's not necessarily an obvious man to Horn to follow. If he does travel, I'd bet on it being with Jennings, who aligns on the line of scrimmage more often than does Pearsall, who goes into motion more often.The Panthers' best bet here is to plug up the run game and turn the 49ers into a one-dimensional passing offense and then generate considerably pressure on Purdy. That's easier said than done, obviously, and even if you can do it, you still have to worry about all the various weapons the Niners can throw at you through the air. \nPrediction\nThe Niners looked great in Brock Purdy's return to the field last week, and that was against a better defense than the one they'll face on Monday night. I know the Panthers finally figured out a way to throw the ball all over the yard themselves last week, but that's still an aberration when it comes to their season-long performance. If San Francisco can hold Rico Dowdle in check, I think the Niners should roll.Prediction: 49ers 27, Panthers 16\n            ",

You can dissect the overtime wins at Kentucky and Mississippi State, but the victories over top-10 foes Oklahoma and Vanderbilt -- plus a one-score loss at No. 1 Ohio State -- warrant a second look.Losses by Georgia Tech and USC last week cleared part of the path. If Miami falls at Pitt, the Longhorns might be a shoo-in. A Vanderbilt win over Tennessee would help, too.Of course, this isn't the CFP rankings.

    "body": "\n        USA Basketball is set to hold its senior national team camp from Dec. 12-14, and Caitlin Clark is among the prominent stars who will make their debuts on the training camp roster. The Indiana Fever superstar is one of 10 players set to participate in the senior camp for the first time. Paige Bueckers and Angel Reese will also debut at the three-day event, which will take place on campus at Duke.Cameron Brink, Sonia Citron, Veronica Burton, Kiki Iriafen and Rickea Jackson round out the WNBA players poised to play at the senior camp for the first time. From the college ranks, USC's JuJu Watkins and UCLA's Lauren Betts also picked up invitations. Watkins, who tore an ACL in last season's NCAA Tournament, will not partake in on-court activities but figures to benefit from the opportunity to work with and learn from the players and coaches in attendance.Among those rounding out the camp roster are former Olympic team members Kelsey Plum, Brittney Griner, Chelsea Gray, Jackie Young and Kahleah Copper. 3x3 Olympian Dearica Hamby earned an invitation, as well. Brionna Jones and Aliyah Boston will also return to the camp.The training camp invitations give the 18 players an opportunity to shine in front of the USA Basketball administrators and coaches, who will construct a roster next year for the 2026 FIBA World Cup. First-time national team coach, and coach of Duke's women's basketball team, Kara Lawson will lead the camp while WNBA coaches Natalie Nakase (Valkyries), Nate Tibbetts (Mercury) and Stephanie White (Fever) assist.\nTeam USA already qualified for the World Cup by way of its 2025 Women's AmeriCup title, but the squad will still participate in a qualifying tournament in Puerto Rico next March. The 11-time champions will seek their fifth consecutive World Cup crown when competition begins next September in Germany.Caitlin Clark injury statusClark missed the second half of the 2025 WNBA season with a groin injury and played in just 13 games as she battled multiple ailments during the campaign. It was a down year by her superstar standards even when she was on the court, as she shot just 27.9% from 3-point range. Her scoring was also down from 19.2 points per game as a rookie to 16.5 in her second professional season.With the Fever slowplaying Clark's return to action, she had still not progressed to playing 5-on-5 as recently as late October. Coach Stephanie White said the team will work Clark back up to full speed over the course of the offseason to prevent setbacks or regression in her recovery.\nWhat that means for Clark's availability at USA Basketball camp remains to be seen. Her goal remains to suit up for Team USA in the World Cup qualifiers.\n            ",

McCarthy is in concussion protocol and his availability for Sunday's game against the Seattle Seahawks is in question, coach Kevin O'Connell announced Monday. If McCarthy is unable to go, rookie Max Brosmer would be in line to make his first career start. McCarthy apparently suffered the setback in Minnesota's 23-6 Week 12 loss to the Green Bay Packers. He was on the field for Minnesota's final drive late in the fourth quarter and threw an interception to Packers defensive back Evan Williams that allowed Green Bay to run the clock out. That was McCarthy's second interception of the game and 10th of the season. The former first-round pick also threw for a season-low 87 yards and posted a passer rating of 34.2, the worst of his career. McCarthy has thrown more interceptions than touchdowns in four of his six starts this season. He entered the 2025 season as Minnesota's starter after the Vikings let former quarterback Sam Darnold, who will suit up for the Seahawks on Sunday, walk in free agency. \nMcCarthy had three interceptions to two touchdowns in Minnesota's first two games before suffering a high ankle sprain that kept him sidelined for over a month. McCarthy returned on Nov. 2 and led the Vikings to a win against the Detroit Lions. The Vikings are 0-3 in their last three games with McCarthy leading the offense. McCarthy, who joined Minnesota as the 10th overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, also missed all of his rookie season after tearing his meniscus in his first preseason game with the Vikings. \nBrosmer signed with Minnesota in April 2025 as an undrafted free agent. The Minnesota product made his first appearance on Sept. 21 against the Cincinnati Bengals and has completed five of his eight passes for 42 yards this season. \n            \n    ",

Anyone who follows him could be way up.    Here are Green's best bets and analysis   for Chelsea vs. Barcelona on Tuesday.Chelsea vs. Barcelona picksChelsea draw no bet (-130): 1uOver 3.5 goals (+100): 0.5uPedro Neto Over 1.5 shots on target (-107): 0.5uChelsea will aim to get their Champions League campaign back on track when they host Barcelona at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday. The Blues slipped down to 12th in the group stage table after drawing 2-2 with Qarabag last time out. Manager Enzo Maresca rested several key players for that game, and Chelsea ultimately paid the price. He certainly won't make the same mistake against Barcelona. They're one of the best teams in Europe, so Maresca should field his strongest starting XI. It promises to be an entertaining game as both teams struggle defensively, but they're stacked with attacking talent.Neto and Fernandez keep Chelsea tickingChelsea moved up to second in the Premier League table after securing a routine 2-0 away win against Burnley at the weekend. The Blues are on a three-game winning streak in the league, and they're unbeaten in their last five matches. Star player Cole Palmer has  been out injured for most of the season and he'll miss this game after breaking his toe. Fortunately, his teammates have stepped up. Winger Pedro Neto and midfielder Enzo Fernández both scored in the win against Burnley. They're the club's joint top scorers this season with four goals apiece. João Pedro also has four goals, while Moisés Caicedo has found the back of the net three times. Defenders Trevoh Chalobah, Reece James, Malo Gusto, and Josh Acheampong have all chipped in with vital goals, along with forwards Estêvão and Alejandro Garnacho. Liam Delap has now recovered from an injury, and former Barcelona striker Marc Guiu offers another solid option in attack. Chelsea boast a great deal of firepower, so they should be able to exploit Barcelona's defensive weaknesses. Barça have conceded 15 goals in 13 La Liga games this season and they've also conceded seven times in four Champions League matches.However, Chelsea are also vulnerable in defense. Levi Colwill is injured, so Maresca normally pairs Chalobah with Toisin Adarabioyo at center back. They never look entirely convincing. The Blues have conceded four goals in six Champions League matches, and they concede about a goal per game in the Premier League on average. It's hard to see them keeping the likes of Lamine Yamal and Robert Lewandowski at bay for 90 minutes, so this should be a high-scoring match.Barcelona might be Europe's most entertaining teamBarcelona also dropped points in their last Champions League game. They comprehensively outplayed Club Brugge in Belgium but defensive lapses cost them, and the game finished 3-3. They bounced back by beating Celta Vigo 4-2 in a league match, and they then thrashed Athletic Club 4-0 on Saturday. They've fired in 36 goals in 13 La Liga games this season, which is a remarkable record.However, the defense has been their Achilles' heel. They've only kept one clean sheet in their last 11 games, which is concerning. They play a high defensive line, and pacy wingers like Neto and Jamie Gittens could exploit it. Barcelona are arguably the most entertaining team in Europe. Their last six games have seen 30 goals - an average of five per game - and we've seen 4.8 goals per game in their last 20 Champions League matches. Key midfielder Pedri is likely to miss this game, so Marc Casado could partner Frenkie de Jong in the middle of the park. They'll have their work cut out against Caicedo and Fernández, two of the best midfielders in the world. The team that wins the midfield battle should go on and win this game. It could be tight as these teams look evenly matched. They're level on points in the Champions League group, they're both flying in their domestic leagues and both have extremely talented players in most positions.Ultimately, home field advantage could swing things in Chelsea's favor. The Blues have won both Champions League matches at Stamford Bridge this season. They'll face a much sterner test of their mettle against Barcelona but they could ultimately prevail if Caicedo and Fernández grab this game by the scruff of the neck.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The third AP Top 25 poll of the 2025-26 season was released Monday, and despite a push from Arizona, Purdue remains the No. 1-ranked team. The Boilermakers leapfrogged Houston last week for the top spot in the poll after recording a statement win over Alabama and received 46 first-place votes this week to remain No. 1.Arizona comes off a statement 71-67 win on the road over UConn. The Wildcats jumped two spots to No. 2 and received 11 first-place votes in the poll. Houston also received first-place votes.The Wildcats boast arguably the nation's best résumé so far. Arizona already has wins over Florida, UCLA and, most recently, UConn. The Wildcats face Auburn and Alabama before the calendar turns to the new year.Speaking of Alabama, Nate Oats' team jumped back into the top 10 after a 90-86 win over Illinois. The Crimson Tide jumped three spots to No. 8 after picking up their second top-10 win.\nAnother winner from last week was Michigan State. The Spartans made a statement with an 83-66 win over Kentucky in the Champions Classic behind the stellar play of Jaxon Kohler, who has finished as the leading scorer in three of MSU's first five games. MSU jumped six spots to No. 11.AP Top 251. Purdue (46)2. Arizona (11)3. Houston (4)4. Duke5. UConn6. Louisville7. Michigan8. Alabama9. BYU10. Florida11. Michigan State12. Gonzaga13. Illinois14.

The voters already showed willingness to move teams out of the No. 1 spot (see Houston and Purdue the last few weeks) despite either of those teams not losing. One can certainly make the case that Purdue should remain No. 1 until it sustains a loss, but Arizona should be the top-ranked team in the poll. No team in the country has a better résumé. The Wildcats recorded three ranked wins, including one against UConn. It was also surprising that the Wildcats only received 11 first-place votes.Indiana enters the pollFor the first time this season, Indiana gets ranked in the AP poll. The Hoosiers are off to a 5-0 start in Year 1 of the Darian Devries era and have a 23-point win on the résumé over Marquette. Indiana faces a tough stretch coming up, with nonconference games against Kansas State, Louisville and Kentucky. Tucker DeVries, the son of the coach, is also off to a strong start. He averages19.2 points, 5.8 rebounds and 2.8 assists after injury cut last season short. Kansas drops outKansas is out of the AP Top 25. Kansas is off to a 3-2 start with losses against North Carolina and Duke so far. The Jayhawks have been without star guard Darryn Peterson, the projected No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NBA Draft, for the last three games. It's unclear when he will return to the lineup. Kansas embarks upon upcoming stretch against Syracuse, UConn, Missouri and NC State before Big 12 play begins. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Cleveland Browns will keep Shedeur Sanders in the starting lineup for their Week 13 game against the San Francisco 49ers, according to CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones. Sanders delivered in the Browns' 24-10 win over the Las Vegas Raiders, leading a young offense to a win in his starting debut.Dillon Gabriel still looms as a candidate to return to the starting role upon his recovery from a concussion, but Sanders will fend off his fellow rookie for at least one more game.Stefanski declined to commit to Sanders in the immediate wake of his 11-for-20 performance against the Raiders. While the rookie passed for 209 yards and his first career touchdown and guided the Browns to their first win in over a month, his coach would not make a snap decision on whether that was enough to earn another look in the starting lineup.\"I'm not going to get into that,\" Stefanski said after the game. \"Obviously proud of him, proud of this offense. There are a ton of things to learn from, but I'm just going to worry about today.\"\nSanders became the first Browns quarterback since 1995 to win his first start. Cleveland signal-callers were 0-17 in their debuts dating back to 1999 before the former Colorado Buffaloes star snapped the dreadful streak. Whether he will have a chance to build a winning streak comes down to a decision Stefanski will make later in the week.\"I'm always going to take my time and do what's best for the football team,\" Stefanski said.The starting debut was a colossal step forward for Sanders, who was abysmal in the second half of the Week 11 loss to the Baltimore Ravens when he filled in for the injured Gabriel. But even in a victorious effort, the first-year quarterback showed room for improvement. He had multiple bad misses, including an interception, and completed just 55% of his throws against one of the weakest opponents the NFL has to offer.\n\"He did a nice job,\" Stefanski said. \"I thought he saw it clearly. With young players, are there going to be things that he can do better? Absolutely. But that's what it is when you're playing with young players. There's improvements to be made.\"Although Sanders is 1-0 as a starter and delivered a couple of explosive plays to what has all year been a middling offense, Gabriel also represents a promising young option for the Browns. His six-game run as the leader of the offense came with just one win but was largely competitive, and he was on track to defeat the Ravens before he exited with a concussion.Gabriel, whom the Browns selected two rounds ahead of Sanders, offers more in the way of dual-threat ability and rushed for positive yardage in all but one of his starts. He is a 59.2% passer on the year with a solid seven touchdowns to two interceptions.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Shedeur Sanders' performance in his first NFL start is giving many of his supporters a chance to take a long-awaited victory lap. That includes President Donald Trump, who praised the Browns' rookie quarterback following Sunday's 24-10 win over the Raiders. Sanders, who made his regular season debut a week earlier, went 11 of 20 for 209 yards with a touchdown and an interception against the Raiders. His memorable day included a 66-yard touchdown pass to Dylan Sampson that made it a 24-3 game midway through the fourth quarter. \"Shedeur Sanders was GREAT,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"Wins first game, career start, as a pro (for Cleveland). Great Genes. I TOLD YOU SO!\"This isn't the first time that Trump has publicly backed Sanders. During the 2025 NFL Draft, Trump criticized NFL owners after Sanders wasn't selected in the first round. Sanders ultimately fell to the fifth round before the Browns took him with the 144th pick. \n\"He should be 'picked' IMMEDIATELY by a team that wants to WIN,\" Trump wrote at the time. While he's clearly made the President happy, Sanders also provided Browns fans with a glimmer of hope amid another trying season. \nOn Sunday, Sanders became the first Browns quarterback this century to win his first career start, an achievement that he is clearly hoping to parlay into a long and successful tenure in Cleveland. \"I'm just thankful,\" Sanders told CBS Sports' Tiffany Blackmon afterward. \"I think I showed a couple of great pieces. Some things I wish I could get back, but, man, a win is crazy. It's amazing, you know, off of one week of practice! So imagine what a full offseason would look like. It could get dangerous. ... But I'm just truly thankful that everything happened.\" \nTrump and the rest of Sanders' fans received some good news on Monday, as Sanders will reportedly start in Cleveland's upcoming game against the 49ers in what will be Sanders' first career home start. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        NEW YORK – Three hours of sleep before a Monday morning report time of 10:00 a.m. is usually a recipe for disaster, but for Gotham FC, the hard work was already done. While New Yorkers quite literally scurried to work and school, Gotham players and staff boarded an open top bus near City Hall less than 48 hours after winning their second NWSL Championship, the signs of their triumph clear to see. Trophy and winners' medals? Open top bus? Check. Sunglasses to mask the sight of fatigue and the fireball shots that, at the very least, Championship MVP Rose Lavelle and general manager Yael Averbuch West had taken in that morning? Check.It was a fitting return to New York for Gotham, who had won the title in likely \"the toughest way to get there,\" according to midfielder Jaelin Howell. They entered the playoffs as the lowest-ranked team and knocked off the Kansas City Current, who won the NWSL Shield in record-setting fashion this season, reigning champions Orlando Pride and perennial favorites Washington Spirit to claim the title. Gotham were an atypical No. 8 seed – Jaedyn Shaw's famous \"Underdog my ass\" quote was repeated twice on Monday, including by the player herself, and referenced by outgoing mayor Eric Adams. The team's tangible quality stood out during their playoff run, anchored by a rigid defense that limited the Spirit to zero shots on target on Saturday in San Jose and the individual brilliance of both Shaw and Lavelle. At City Hall, though, the intangibles were celebrated.This year's NWSL Championship is Gotham's first since transitioning from a plucky underdog to a super team, boasting the accolades to back up the label. They have reached the NWSL playoff semifinals in each of the last three seasons and Saturday's trophy lift was not their first this season – they won the inaugural edition of the Concacaf W Champions Cup in May, securing their spot in January's first-ever FIFA Women's Champions Cup. It comes as little surprise that a star-studded team would reach these heights on skill alone but as Gotahm's players looked back at a successful campaign, the immeasurable aspects of their talents stood out.\"I think we talked about just our grit and our never say die mentality,\" Howell said, recalling that each of Gotham's four postseason goals were scored in the 68th minute or later. \"I think we have a lot of experienced players that have played in very big games and know how to manage games and credit to everybody just for sticking to it and our coaching staff for coming up with the game plans to keep us in the game until we have our star show up and show out, and so I'm just really happy for them and for the whole team.\"\nUnity was a running theme of Gotham's celebratory remarks especially for minority investor Carolyn Tisch Blodget, who joined the ownership group in late 2022 and has taken a more hands-on role after their 2023 NWSL Championship.\"From my perspective, the biggest thing that I felt like was missing last year was I, as an owner, never really defined our culture.\" Tisch Blodget said. \"We went really deep and built out what our mission was, what our vision was, what our values were and we quite literally spray-painted them all over the office and now we know any time somebody is joining Gotham, whether it's a new ticketing person, whether it's a new player, they know what they're joining in Gotham.\"The word \"family\" continued to pop up, Lavelle poignantly remarking at City Hall that \"when you get to do what you love with people you love, it makes the journey that much sweeter.\" True to form, Gotham have a weird family tradition in their embrace of \"Feliz Navidad\" – the Christmas song blared out as confetti poured on the players on Monday morning, an anthem they adopted back in late summer.\n\"Honestly, we played in the locker room because the Spanish girls always want Spanish music and I think that's the only one they could come up with that has English in it, too,\" Howell said, \"so then we would just play every time we won and then it just became this thing so now we go crazy every time it comes on.\"Gotham's trip to City Hall, though, is the result of several different successful journeys all coming together in the same place at the same time. The victory lap in New York is well-earned on both a collective and individual basis, this year's triumph serving as a catalyst for growth in multiple forms.Jaelin Howell's big weekFor Howell, her first NWSL Championship was sandwiched between a call-up to the U.S. women's national team and her flight to Orlando following the City Hall celebrations. The midfielder could earn her first international cap since 2022 in the USWNT's year-end friendlies with Italy, a fitting reward for a strong first season with Gotham.\n\"It's honestly surreal, but I'm just so blessed,\" Howell said. \"I think it's been, I would say a lot of trials the past couple years and so honestly this year, everything coming together, like I said, it's just amazing. All the hard work behind the scenes, coming out on top and so just really grateful and all of them and the club to take a chance on me, where I feel like home and for all to come together.\"The 26-year-old Howell, a prospect with the USWNT when she last played for the team, has found an ideal landing spot after spending the early years of her career with Racing Louisville and embarking on a brief stint with the Seattle Reign last year.\"I think [head coach] Juan [Carlos Amoros] has had this undenying belief in me and I feel like I honestly haven't really had that,\" she said. \"He's helped with my confidence. All the coaches just doing little extra things for me bringing me in. I think also just the world-class players I get to play with every day and learn from -- [Emily] Sonnett and Rose [Lavelle], getting to play with them, Jess [Carter] and Ann[-Katrin Berger] and Esther [Gonzalez], being able to play with that caliber of player has really excelled my game and I've just tried to soak up every moment and learn from them and so I think it's just a combination of all of that but I think it's also the most joy I've had playing soccer in a very long time and so I think that's honestly what a lot of people close to me see when I play is just the joy that I have right now.\"\nNWSL 'building something great'Gotham may be a two-time NWSL champion but they were first-time visitors to City Hall on Monday, the club correcting course after a missed opportunity in 2023 to host any large celebration after a surprise title-winning run.\"Being able to celebrate like this was the single most important thing to me, personally,\" Tisch Blodget said. \"When we came in, obviously we had just come in as new owners, but that was a complete failure of the organization to not be able to celebrate like the team deserved. Our chief business officer who has worked with me for many years, we started planning this on November 24th of 2023. … Our marketing team, our business team, pulled literal heroics to make this day happen, but it was critical to us that our fans got to celebrate. It was critical to us that every single one of our players got to be here and so we pulled it off.\"Tisch Blodget said she also received the congratulations of other owners around the league in being able to pull off the trip to City Hall, describing them as colleagues that further validates her decision to invest in Gotham three years ago.\n\"I think the thing that I have been impressed by the most, that I think has given me the most assurance that we are building something great, is the group of owners sitting around the board table.\" she said. \"Every single owner believes in what we are building, knows that it's going to be a long, hard journey to get there and this is not an overnight success, but that we are building something special, that when we all look back in 10, 15 years, we will all say, 'Wow, remember we know and knew what the NWSL was?' And that's a really shared belief so obviously we're competitors on the field but we are all business partners at the end of the day.\"Tisch Blodget also expressed her confidence in commissioner Jessica Berman, acting as one of the owners who recently gave the green light to extend Berman's deal by three years.\"Jessica brought tremendous stability to this league,\" she said. \"Everything that happened, we were not owners in the league when everything happened, but Jessica has brought real stability. I think she's built incredible relationships with our media partners, with our brand partners and as I said before, I think really helped bring in a group of owners that were like-minded in their belief, willing to invest and willing to really build something together. I think she listens, she is honest and really hears all sides and is so committed to building this league into what we all believe it can be.\"\nThe executive, who is a member of the Tisch family that has a stake in the NFL's New York Giants, said a busy offseason is ahead for her and Gotham's fellow investors, who generally work harder during the NWSL's break than on matchdays. A busy period awaits for the league as a whole – the NWSL faces an existential question about the salary cap, which is reportedly hindering the league's ability to keep its biggest star in Trinity Rodman.\"I can only speak for myself,\" Tisch Blodget said. \"We are currently, I think, the best league in the world. We want to continue to be the best league in the world. That requires having the best stars and it's a competitive global game, which is great. I think competition makes us all better, but we all need to recognize what that's going to take to continue to be the best.\"\n            ",

Breezy Johnson's time at the 2026 Milano Cortina Games, though, might belong in a class of its own. Four days after winning gold in the women's downhill ski and just moments after crashing out of Thursday's Super-G, Johnson got engaged to Connor Watkins on site.\nNBC Sports captured the entire proposal, with Watkins getting down on one knee and Johnson getting emotional.\"Breezy Noble Johnson, you have worked so hard and achieved so much, and yet you still find the time to love me, to make me feel special, and most importantly, you helped me love myself,\" Watkins said. \"And now that I know what that feels like, there's only one way I want to spend the rest of my life, and that is by your side. I love you Breezy. Will you marry me?\"The two joined \"TODAY\" to discuss the engagement.\nThough the Super-G didn't go as Johnson hoped -- and she also finished fouth alongside Mikaela Shiffrin in the women's team combined -- the downhill was an impressive and eventful triumph. Johnson had to not only overcome teammate Lindsey Vonn's devastating crash but the rest of the field, too.\"Part of what breaks your heart is that you're used to defying the odds,\" Johnson told CBS News about Vonn's injury. \"You're used to writing fairytale endings. And the reality is that those things get made into movies because they're so unlikely. And unfortunately, you can't always -- it's not always like the movies.\"\nJohnson's Olympics, though, have had a movie-like quality, with a little bit of triumph, a little bit of disappointment and a lot of love. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Ole Miss quarterback Trinidad Chambliss was granted a temporary injunction that will allow him to play college football in 2026. Chambliss received the ruling after suing the NCAA in Lafayette County Chancery Court in Mississippi, where a hearing was held on Thursday. Chambliss petitioned the NCAA for a medical waiver that would have granted him another year of eligibility tied to a respiratory condition he experienced in 2022. Ultimately, the NCAA denied it on multiple occasions, leading Chambliss to take his case to court. According to Chambliss' team, he missed the 2022 season because of complications from tonsillitis and chronic fatigue. He had a typical redshirt campaign in 2021 before playing in each of the last three seasons. From 2021-24, he was a player at Division II Ferris State. After transferring to Ole Miss, Chambliss won the starting quarterback job in 2025 and led the Rebels to the national semifinals. \nWhat it means for Ole MissChambliss was one of the best stories of the 2025 season. The Grand Rapids, Michigan, native came to Ole Miss as a backup, but ultimately broke through and won the starting job after incumbent signal caller Austin Simmons suffered an injury. In a sensational campaign, Chambliss completed 66.1% of his passes for 3,937 yards, rushed for 527 yards and scored 30 total touchdowns to only three interceptions. He helped lead Ole Miss to the program's first ever College Football Playoff appearance, where they defeated 11-seed Tulane and 3-seed Georgia before succumbing to national runner-up Miami in the national semifinal. Chambliss finished No. 8 in Heisman Trophy voting.Chambliss ranks as arguably the top returning quarterback in college football and almost certainly tops in the SEC. His return helps supercharge the Rebels under first-year coach Pete Golding and makes them a serious SEC title contender. \nIf Chambliss was denied, Auburn transfer Deuce Knight was expected to be the starting quarterback. The Lucedale, Mississippi, native was the No. 6 quarterback in the Class of 2025 and projects as a future starter for the Rebels when Chambliss's career is done.What's nextChambliss receiving another year of eligibility does not mean that he \"won\" his case. Instead, it means that he will be granted eligibility to play in the NCAA until his case is heard, which will likely happen after the season. At a further date, his lawyers will again have to argue the actual merits of the case before the court. A similar situation occurred in 2025 with Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia. He sued the NCAA to claim that years at a junior college should not count against eligibility at an FBS school. A temporary injunction allowed him to play the 2025 season before the case was actually heard. Pavia's attorneys had a hearing regarding the case earlier this week, even though Pavia has declared for the NFL Draft. \n            ",

Just a day after the San Antonio Spurs agreed to release him, Sochan plans to sign with the New York Knicks for the remainder of the season after he clears waivers, ESPN's Shams Charania is reporting.Sochan, 22, was the No. 9 overall pick out of Baylor in 2022, back when the Spurs were very much in a rebuilding mode. At times placed into a sort of point-forward role as a developmental project with defensive promise, Sochan showed glimpses but generally struggled to find consistency. He averaged 11.0 points on 43% shooting as a rookie and 11.6 points on 44% shooting in his second season.\n        \n            \n                NBA standings predictions: Projecting 1-15 in each conference with two months left in regular season\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLast year, he had his most efficient season, scoring 11.4 points per game on 54% shooting. But persistent perimeter shooting woes -- he's a career 29% 3-point shooter -- came to a head this year, especially with rookie Carter Bryant's emergence. Sochan appeared in just 28 games (zero starts) for the Spurs this season, averaging 12.8 minutes and 4.1 points. He appeared in just two of San Antonio's last 12 games before his release.The Knicks targeted the 6-foot-8 Sochan at the trade deadline but couldn't get a deal done, per SNY's Ian Begley. Given his defensive versatility and athleticism, he could end of figuring into New York's rotation, even for just certain matchups. Even if he doesn't, New York is in essence simply taking a flyer for a young player with upside; Charania reported Sochan had 10 potential suitors.\nNew York is 35-20 this season, third in the East and a half-game behind the Boston Celtics for second. The Knicks also added defensive-minded guard Jose Alvarado at the trade deadline.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Spring training camps opened this week and almost immediately, Major League Baseball saw three notable players succumb to hamate bone injuries: Francisco Lindor of the Mets, Corbin Carroll of the Diamondbacks and Jackson Holliday of the Orioles. Lindor and Carroll are expected back by Opening Day, but Holliday's return will be \"measured in weeks\" after the regular season starts, according to president of baseball operations Mike Elias.The first question that comes to mind with every sports fan out there: why do we only seem to see this injury in baseball? For starters, that's not actually true, even though MLB players do seem to dominate the headlines. Golfer Bryson DeChambeau, for example, missed two months in 2022 after fracturing his hamate bone. But it's all about the equipment.\"This injury is unique in that it only really occurs with a direct blow over the most prominent part of the hamate bone, known as the hook of the hamate,\" Dr. Rodney Benner, an orthopedic surgeon in Indianapolis, told CBS Sports. \"As such, the only way it usually happens is when the end of a bat, golf club, hockey stick or some other object directly impacts the area. Hitters in baseball get jammed or a forceful check swing, which causes the end of the knob if the bat to impact the hamate. This can also happen grounding a golf club or making a similar motion with a hockey stick.\" The next place our minds go is to the preventative aspect. Is there anything hitters can do? The answer is not a ton, really. \n\"There are pads that can be worn over the hook of the hamate to try and cushion the area,\" Benner said. \"Unfortunately fractures of the hamate can still happen.\"And then there's the power. Players returning from broken hamate bones and subsequent surgery have long been assumed to lose their power, at least temporarily. In going back though the last 10 seasons of data, there isn't actually evidence of a loss of power upon return. Here are some prominent cases with decent samples of statistics on both sides of the injury.In 2016, Francisco Cervelli was slugging .293 before the injury (49 games) and slugged .352 after his return (52 games).It was only a 12-game sample before the end of the season, but in 2016 Mark Reynolds returned to hit .281/.378/.500. He was hitting .283/.354/.446 before the injury.Superstar José Ramírez came back for three games in late September after his hamate injury. He homered twice in his first game back and once in his second. Tommy Pham dealt with this in 2020. He hit .207/.316/.293 in 23 games before the injury and .222/.300/.370 in eight games after his return to close the season before hitting .375/.400/.458 in six playoff games. Aristides Aquino homered in his first and fourth games after returning in 2021. Mike Trout in 2023 returned for just one game before re-injuring his wrist to end his season. He was himself to start 2024, homering six times in the first 11 games. Still, it's always possible there are lingering issues, as with any procedure.For years, we've heard stories, including from famed surgeon Dr. James Andrews, about youth players and their parents asking to have preventative Tommy John surgery without even having torn the ulnar collateral ligament in their elbow. Could we apply that mindset here and see players wanting to have their hamate surgery (removal of the bone) without it actually being injured?\nFormer All-Star Andrew Benintendi had his hamate bone removed after breaking it in college, only to somehow break it again in 2022. It was unclear at the time if the bone had regrown or not been fully removed.\"I am not aware of anyone advocating for removing the hook of the hamate to prevent injury in an athlete that does not have pain or other symptoms associated with it,\" Benner told CBS Sports. \"However, athletes can experience chronic pain in the hamate from repetitive trauma to the area, as opposed to a one-time acute injury on a specific swing. Nonsurgical treatment is possible in chronic cases in those athletes, but there is a high risk of continued symptoms or progression of the injury resulting in a complete fracture and subsequent surgery. It is possible to fix the hook of the hamate with a screw, but nonunion (failure of healing) of the fracture is common, so many athletes have the hook excised rather than fixed. Excision can usually result in rapid return to play within 6-8 weeks. However, mild strength loss and tenderness in the area can limit the ability to swing the bat effectively in the early phase of return to play. The ulnar nerve, one of the main nerves in the wrist and hand, is also nearby, so nerve complications are possible with surgery.\"The expectation here is that, while players continue to get bigger and stronger -- swinging harder -- while facing pitchers that throw harder and harder, we'll continue to see this injury pop up predominantly in baseball. The good news is it's a relatively quick-and-easy procedure and players are back to being themselves shortly thereafter. May that be the same for Lindor, Carroll and Holliday.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        After an offseason of trade speculation, the Philadelphia Phillies are cutting ties with Nick Castellanos. Castellanos has been released, the team announced Thursday. The Phillies will owe him his $20 million salary this season minus the prorated portion of the $780,000 league minimum if/when he signs with another club.Castellanos, 34 next month, is coming off a career-worst season in 2025. He hit .240/.294/.400 with 17 home runs and bumped heads with manager Rob Thomson at times. On Thursday, Castellanos admitted to bringing a beer into the dugout after being removed from a game last June. Add in right field defense that borders on unplayable, and Castellanos was a minus-0.6 WAR player in 2025. All told, he put up only plus-0.8 WAR in four seasons with the Phillies. POBO Dave Dombrowski indicated the Phillies would look to move Castellanos at the outset of the offseason, though his salary and declining production made that difficult.  The Phillies waited as long as possible -- position players report to camp Monday -- to see whether a team would take on even a small part of Castellanos' salary in a trade, which didn't happen. That was always going to be a challenge. It was clear the Phillies were ready to move on. Interested teams knew he would be available as a free agent eventually. \nPhiladelphia signed Adolis García to a one-year, $10 million contract earlier in the offseason to replace Castellanos. They are similar hitters with power and plate discipline issues, though García is a much better defender. If nothing else, he will be an enormous defensive upgrade in right field. Thomson's regular lineup will look something like this: SS Trea Turner, RHBDH Kyle Schwarber, LHB1B Bryce Harper, LHB3B Alec Bohm, RHBLF Brandon Marsh (LHB) and Otto Kemp (RHB)RF Adolis García, RHB2B Bryson Stott, LHBC J.T. Realmuto, RHBCF Justin Crawford, LHBOnce he clears release waivers, Castellanos will be free to sign with any team for the prorated minimum. The San Diego Padres were said to have interest in Castellanos in the offseason, though they recently signed Miguel Andujar to be their DH. The Toronto Blue Jays could show interest after losing Anthony Santander to shoulder surgery, though George Springer is locked in as the designated hitter. Non-contenders like the Chicago White Sox and Washington Nationals might be Castellanos' best shot at a job in the short-term. The better move would be waiting until spring training games get underway and seeing whether injuries create any needs league-wide. Right now, it doesn't appear there would be much demand for a sub-replacement level DH. \nThe Phillies went 96-66 and won the NL East last season, then were eliminated by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLDS. Castellanos started three of the four NLDS games and went 2 for 15 in the series. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        One of the most valuable freshmen in the sport may have played his last game in college.North Carolina announced Thursday afternoon that stellar freshman forward Caleb Wilson suffered a left hand fracture during the first half of the Tar Heels' 75-66 road loss against Miami on Tuesday.\"X-rays taken during the game were negative, and he returned to play later in the second half vs. the Hurricanes, but additional imaging done in Chapel Hill revealed the fracture,\" per the school. \"The evaluation process is ongoing to determine the timetable for Wilson's return.\"Wilson played 26 minutes against Miami, his fewest against a power-conference opponent this season. He also logged a season-low 12 points.\nImpact on UNC's lineupBroken hands can sometimes lead to extended absences, so there is no telling whether or not Wilson will be able to suit up in the near future, or if the injury and subsequent rehab will force him to sit deep into March. Wilson has been one of the best freshman performers in what's increasingly considered the deepest one-and-done class in college basketball history. At 19.8 points and 9.4 rebounds per game, Wilson has doubly proven to be among the best freshmen in Carolina history. His 17 20-point outings are the most by any first-year player for the program. Wilson played all 40 minutes in UNC's instant-epic win over rival Duke on Saturday, scoring 23 points to go with four rebounds, two assists, two steals and a block. North Carolina also notes Wilson's 66 dunks are the most of any player in college basketball. Without Wilson, UNC loses formidable inside defense, scoring, flexibility and recovery. There is no replacing his motor or stamina, either. UNC ranks outside the top 40 in defensive efficiency at KenPom and has relied on Wilson's unrelenting hustle and playmaking to make a jump this season after barely making the 2025 NCAA Tournament. \nUNC has been playing an eight-man rotation for the majority of the year. The Heels' four starters will remain Henri Veesar in the middle, Jarin Stevenson in the frontcourt (likely moving from the 3 and replacing Wilson as the 4-man), veteran shooting guard Seth Trimble and freshman Derek Dixon, a rising star running the point in the backcourt. The most likely tweak to keep UNC with some viable size in its most common lineup will be to inject 6-6 swingman Luka Bogavac into the starting five. The 22-year-old from Montenegro started 13 games earlier in the year.Backup shooting guard Jonathan Powell and point guard Kyan Evans (who's started 17 times) will see their roles increased as well. Everyone else has played spot duty. Can UNC go seven-deep as it turns toward the month-long stretch to Selection Sunday?\nNCAA tourney seed outlook TBDThursday's news makes North Carolina one of the most interesting teams to track over the next month. There's a wide spectrum of outcomes in play because the loss of Wilson will be problematic for a 19-5 Heels crew that is ranked 11th this week but doesn't have an NCAA seed projection that harmonizes with its AP ranking. The Tar Heels are currently hovering between the 6- and 7-line in CBS Sports' most recent NCAA Tournament bracketology outlook. Depending on how the Tar Heels play in the weeks ahead without their most talented player, the committee will evaluate (but not necessarily punish) UNC with and without Wilson. Now, if UNC can win way more often than not without its most vital player, the committee will reward the Heels accordingly. \nThe next game is manageable: UNC hosts lowly Pitt on Saturday, then has back-to-back road tests against North Carolina State and Syracuse. Home games against Louisville and Clemson still await (both are pacing toward healthy tourney seeds) and of course there's the season finale at Duke.An Atlanta native, Wilson projects as a top-five draft prospect. North Carolina hasn't had a player drafted in the top five since Marvin Williams went No. 2 in 2005.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Around the world, it may have been a quieter transfer deadline day than expected, but Atletico Madrid were able to secure an under-the-radar move that could have a significant impact on both their team and on the World Cup in 20-year-old Obed Vargas. The rising talent made the move from the Seattle Sounders to Madrid on deadline day, going from preparing for the Major League Soccer season to kick off soon to debuting in the Copa Del Rey for Atletico Madrid the next.Vargas has already logged 25 minutes for Atleti in all competitions, as Diego Simeone has wasted no time getting him into the squad. Atleti got a first-hand look at Vargas during the FIFA Club World Cup last summer when they defeated the Sounders in group stage play, and the young midfielder was also able to meet a player whom he idolizes, Antoine Griezmann. Less than a year from that moment, Vargas is playing alongside him.\nThis is a move that may have come faster than Vargas expected, but it was one that he always strove for. During MLS media day, Vargas todl CBS Sports, \"My objective is winning MLS Cup for sure, that's what I want to win, but after that, if you're asking personally for me, I want to play in Europe and I think that would be a huge step for me.\"After an excellent MLS season where Vargas was named the best player under 22 in the league and also earned his first cap for the Mexican national team, he's now in LaLiga looking to make his mark again. On the list of players to earn that distinction, such as Diego Gomez, Ricardo Pepi, Brenden Aaronson, and Alphonso Davies, Vargas is in good company, joining players who have succeeded abroad and become fixtures in their national teams. Despite his age, it's clear why Atleti would covet Vargas in the transfer market, looking at how some of his stats with Seattle ranked last season.\n\n                                                                    CBS Sports\n                                                            Vargas does a little bit of everything in midfield while keeping an eye forward to set up attackers. Joining the Seattle academy in 2019, the Alaska native has excelled at every step along the way and welcomes the competition and challenges that come with it.\"I like playing against the best, I've always said it, and all that competition is welcome. To be the best, you have to beat the best, and I welcome that competition,\" Vargas said.With the influx of talent in MLS, he's been able to test himself against some of the best players in the world, but now the level of difficulty is going up with the move to LaLiga. A Copa Del Rey fixture against Barcelona is on the horizon, and it's another chance for Vargas to use whatever minutes he can gain to show why he should be a starter. If he's able to become a regular in the rotation, Mexican national team head coach Javier Aguirre, who used to coach Atletico Madrid, will also need to take notice. A player like Vargas in Simeone's midfield will be well set for World Cup play, something that USMNT fans will know from American midfielder Johnny Cardoso striving for a similar goal at the same club.\nHow to watch Atletico Madrid vs. Barcelona, oddsDate: Thursday, Feb. 12 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Ryiad Air Metropolitano -- Madrid, SpainLive stream: ESPN+Odds: Atletico Madrid +200; Draw +295; Barcelona +120Vargas has been capped three times by the Mexican national team while also representing El Tri at the youth levels after utilizing a one-time federation shift to represent them instead of the United States men's national team. His last appearance for Mexico was in a January friendly against Panama, but a short-term goal will be making the March roster when El Tri will face Portugal and Belgium. Of course, the long-term goal (despite the fact that it's approaching rapidly) is to represent Mexico at the World Cup on home soil.\"[The World Cup] is definitely an objective, it's in the back of my mind all the time. Each day we get closer, that's the reality. I know the expectations there is for Mexico, I know the pressure that is there for the national team. If I get called in for the next camp for the World Cup,\" Vargas said. \"Expectations are high, pressure is gonna be there, but I like that pressure, I want to be there annd I think it's also a beautiful responsiblity to be able to represent your national team at a World Cup in front of my family, in front of our fans and all I can hope for and that I pray is that I do things the right way and take all the necessary steps to be there.\"So far, so good on that front for the young midfielder. It's important to take moves like this one step at a time because he won't become an overnight starter for Madrid, but on his current trajectory, all of these goals could be accomplished just like he's broken through at every step of the way already. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        CHAMPAIGN, Il. -- Long-time \"Voice of the Illini,\" Brian Barnhart, climbed to his feet, readied a Tiger Woods-like fist pump and primed the vocals for his patented, \"He got it!\" call as Keaton Wagler whisked by and rose into the air with five Wisconsin defenders converging and the clock dwindling.Wagler passed up a potential game-tying shot in the final seconds of overtime against Michigan State on Saturday. Surely, this time would be different. Surely, this out-of-nowhere freshman sensation had one last trick in his bag to punctuate a 34-point, seven-assist Herculean effort.In an alternate universe, that 3-pointer goes in just like the 66 others Wagler has splashed in his cannonball-like entrance to the Big Ten.Alas, the iron was unkind, but a jump-cut to Wagler's face provided no hints. You get almost no emotion from Wagler during a game, aside from an occasional shoulder shrug after an old-fashioned three-point play or a subtle three-finger signal to his own bench after canning a parking-lot 3-pointer. \n\"It's kind of always just been taught to me to try not to show emotions on the court, like good or bad,\" Wagler says. \"My dad (Logan) taught me that. If I get mad or frustrated, he's always like, 'Don't show opponents that you're upset.' He always says, 'Don't show weakness.'\"This kind, skinny, under-ranked, ice-cold freshman is the person that the Underwood Family Business has chosen to build everything around. Coach Brad Underwood is pursuing Illinois' first trip to the Final Four since 2005. Offensive coordinator Tyler Underwood is on a chase to build the No. 1 offense in the country. Wagler is on a chase of something he didn't even know was possible. There are just five true freshmen in the long, proud history of Big Ten basketball who have averaged at least 17 points, four rebounds and four assists:\nMagic Johnson, Michigan State; No. 1 pick in the 1979 NBA Draft.Jalen Rose, Michigan; No. 13 pick in the 1994 NBA DraftD'Angelo Russell, Ohio State; No. 2 pick in the 2015 NBA DraftDylan Harper, Rutgers; No. 2 pick in the 2025 NBA DraftKeaton Wagler, Illinois; No. 150 recruit in the Class of 2025, per 247Sports (and that was the highest rating of all the recruiting services).Wagler is putting the final touches on a case to post the best season from a freshman guard that the Big Ten has ever housed in the one-and-done era, which dates back two decades. The numbers that Russell and Harper put up are comparable, but the teams are not. Russell's 2014-15 Ohio State club was 24-11 and earned a No. 10 seed in the Big Dance. Try as he might to flip the script, Harper's Rutgers squad finished under .500. Meanwhile, Wagler is leading an Illinois team that has national title aspirations and is tracking for a No. 2 or No. 3 seed. He's breaking both brains and models along the way.Best individual seasons from a Big Ten freshman since 2008, per Bart Torvik's Box-Plus Minus calculations:Keaton Wagler, Illinois: 11.8 BPMCody Zeller, Indiana: 10.9 BPMRobbie Hummel, Purdue: 10.8 BPMD'Angelo Russell, Ohio State: 10.8 BPMJaren Jackson Jr., Michigan State: 10.8 BPM\"I am surprised how fast my game translated to this level,\" Wagler said. \"I thought it might take a little bit for me to get used to the physicality and speed of the game.\"\nOh, he's adjusted all right. His 46-point eruption in Mackey Arena against then-No. 4 Purdue broke Illinois' single-game freshman scoring record. He gave then-No. 7 Nebraska 28 points and five dimes. He drained a halfcourt shot against Northwestern. He's posted a 30.7 assist rate in Big Ten play and a 2.4-to-1 assist-to-turnover ratio against league foes ahead of Sunday's clash against rival Indiana (1 p.m.  ET on CBS).\"Nothing,\" Brad Underwood said after the Wisconsin game when asked what else he could possibly need from Wagler. \"He needs help. He got picked up 94 feet, and they denied him. Not like that bothers him, but it's remarkable. Quite remarkable what he's doing. I didn't realize he had 34. It was the quietest 34 that there was. He's getting beaten on. Their bench stands up and claps when they commit a hard foul on him in the first half.  That's what teams are trying to do to him ... couldn't be prouder of him.\"Wagler points to a transformative summer in which he packed weight onto his thin frame with help from Adam Fletcher, Illinois' revered strength and conditioning coach. He survived Kylan Boswell's trial by fire and earned gushing praise from Illinois' senior guard. He learned what it was like to try and navigate a shot-blocker like 7-foot-2 big man Zvonimir Ivisic, who has go-go gadget arms and swats anything and everything. He convinced the Underwoods that he had to be in Illinois' starting lineup.\nOh, and made a friend.Tyler Underwood, 29, has become one of the premier offensive masterminds in college basketball. It was Tyler who convinced his dad to target Wagler on the recruiting trail. The dance between point guard and offensive coordinator is similar to the quarterback-playcaller tango on the gridiron. That mind-meld between Underwood and Wagler was built on the belief that there was more to this gangly big guard from Shawnee, Kansas, who is a little scrawny but can drill pull-up jumpers and seems to make the right play again and again and again.\"Before every game, he's always telling me, 'They can't guard you; just play how you always play,'\" Wagler said. \"Then, he just trusts me a lot to make decisions. Especially in late-game situations, he will just put the ball in my hands. He believes I'm gonna make the right play every time. We always mess around with each other, so it's a good relationship that we have. It honestly seems more like best friends, really. It's cool.\"\nThere's even more history on the line for Wagler, whether he likes it or not. No freshman has ever won Big Ten Player of the Year. Wagler is firmly in the thick of that race with Michigan's Yaxel Lendeborg, Michigan State's Jeremy Fears Jr. and Purdue's Braden Smith. The beauty of this college basketball season is that there's a crescendo coming. The stakes are growing by the game, and Wagler knows what's coming down the pipe. Illinois has national championship aspirations, and he can help take them to the mountaintop if he keeps hooping like this.But in a lot of ways, Wagler wants to keep it all the same -- just keep taking the singles in his pick-and-roll game. Just keep firing from downtown if the defense relaxes for just a moment. Just keep rebounding, which is a major point of emphasis for his dad, Logan. \nWagler tries to get at least one offensive rebound per game and tip another one out for a second-chance opportunity. He has 46 offensive boards in 25 games this year. That keeps his dad and coach extremely happy. Just keep going back to the well with that patented tight spin move that he's used to de-pants defenders left and right since he added it to his holster his junior year at Shawnee Mission Northwest High School. \"It's just always worked,\" Wagler says with a laugh. \"I just spin super quickly, and it's not a slow spin. It's just like a quick spin, and I get it out to my other hand before they can get to it. And then usually if a team starts to recognize it and try to come steal it, I can see them coming, so I'll hold it in tight and be able to kick it out. It's hard to stop even if teams know it's coming.\"His name might bring a shudder in Mackey's walls, but Wagler still hasn't dove headfirst into the NIL world. In an era of $3 million contracts for the biggest name in the portal and $1 million deals for role players, Wagler is primed to be the lowest-paid All-American by a country mile. \nHe had a small promotional deal with McLeod Express, a trucking company in Decatur, Illinois. The t-shirt business has been booming -- one features his shot chart from the Purdue masterclass, where he went 13-for-17 from the field, has been flying off the rack -- but that's about it on the money-making front.\"There is one shirt that has my face on it, I think I look crazy in,\" Wagler says.We'll get the R&D team on that, pronto.There's money to be made later. Wagler's summer schedule is already filling up. His May will be spent at the NBA Draft Combine. Illinois wing Andrej Stojakovic wants to jet back to his home country of Greece after the season to take another swanky vacation. Boswell earned the invite in August. Round 2 will have another visitor.\n\"Andrej was like, 'You're coming with us this time,'\" Wagler says. \"I think I'm on board for that.\"Just add that to the stack of invites that Wagler has earned, but the itinerary better keep June 24 clear. Wagler will have more history to make on that night.Maybe he'll even crack a smile.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        A new era of Pac-12 football is near with the rebuilt conference set to debut this fall. The eight-team league announced its 2026 schedule on Wednesday, which features a round-robin slate and a unique \"flex\" matchup for each team in Week 13. That flex week could prove instrumental in determining the College Football Playoff picture as the Pac-12 seeks to establish itself as the preeminent Group of Six league and send one of its members to the 12-team tournament.The modest size of the reimagined Pac-12 creates a reality in which teams cannot play more than seven conference games. Maintaining a three-game nonconference slate with a bye week leaves one unclaimed date on each squad's schedule, and it is with that open slot that the Pac-12 will introduce the flex games.The flex week introduces one repeat matchup per team. Every program will play a Pac-12 team it faced earlier in the year, but importantly, the Week 13 rematch will not count towards conference standings. Last year effectively provided a trial run of this format, as Oregon State and Washington State played a home-and-home wherein the first game counted as an official Pac-12 contest and the second was a non-conference battle.Here is everything we know about the Pac-12 flex week and what it could mean for the conference's CFP outlook.\nFlex week gives Pac-12 unique advantage in CFP raceAs with every other Group of Six conference, the Pac-12 aims to produce one of the five highest-ranked league champions in college football to secure an automatic bid into the CFP. Pairing two former power conference programs in Oregon State and Washington State with five top-flight Mountain West schools and a rising Sun Belt contender gives this league a bevy of potential playoff hopefuls.The flex week allows the Pac-12 to assess late in the season which of its teams have the most realistic paths to the CFP and to dynamically adjust their schedules to increase their odds of earning berths.Say Boise State stands at No. 15 in the CFP rankings in mid-November and that no other Group of Six teams are in the top 25. The Pac-12 could hand the Broncos a highly winnable matchup in the flex week to ensure they remain undefeated.\nOr perhaps Fresno State is in a battle with teams from the American and Sun Belt and needs a marquee win to set itself apart. The conference could pit the Bulldogs against the second-best team in the league in hopes that they win and boost their profile.Furthermore, since the flex game is a nonconference matchup, the top two teams in the league can lose in Week 13 and still participate in the Pac-12 Championship Game. That offers some margin for error where a highly regarded team could still qualify for the CFP as a conference champion even with a late-season loss.Pac-12 flex week stipulationsWhile the Pac-12 has complete authority over which teams play which in Week 13, it still must abide by one key rule with regard to game locations. That is, teams are guaranteed at least six home games in total and four against conference opponents. Since half of the league will only play three conference home games, the other half is guaranteed to play at home during the flex week.\nColorado State, Fresno State, Utah State and Washington State will host their flex games regardless of their opponents.Additional considerations could come into play in determining the matchups, but there are no guarantees. The Pac-12 specifically noted in its schedule release that it will attempt to prevent repeat road trips. For example, since Boise State has a road game at Fresno State in Week 6, the league would try not to force the Broncos to play the Bulldogs at Valley Children's Stadium again in Week 13.Projected Pac-12 flex matchupsThe Pac-12 announced four projected matchups for Week 13. These contests follow the aforementioned criterion of no team playing two road games against the same opponent.\nBoise State at Utah StateTexas State at Colorado StateSan Diego State at Fresno StateOregon State at Washington StateIn practice, the conference will likely need to be lenient when it comes to repeat road trips. Any deviation from these projections will almost certainly force at least one team to play a second game in an away stadium.When will Pac-12 flex games be determined?Flex games will be finalized no later than six days ahead of kickoff. That makes Sunday, Nov. 22 the deadline to announce the Week 13 pairings. Matchups could be determined before that date, though.One disadvantage of this deadline is that the Pac-12 must set its flex games prior to the Week 13 CFP Top 25 rankings release. That is less than ideal since the conference aims to use the flex week to better position its playoff contenders, but the Week 12 rankings and results should help the conference to make an informed decision.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        One of the top NFL storylines this offseason is the saga between the Las Vegas Raiders and their star pass rusher, Maxx Crosby. The five-time Pro Bowler was shut down by the franchise in December due to a knee injury -- a decision Crosby \"vehemently\" disagreed with, according to Jay Glazer of Fox. After the way that situation was handled, Crosby is reportedly going to reevaluate his future with the organization. There has been some mixed messaging with this situation. Glazer for example believes Crosby's time with the Raiders is over, but Crosby has not requested a trade, and is in a \"great place\" with the team, according to NFL Media. However, according to Albert Breer of The MMQB, the Raiders have a lot of work to do to repair their relationship with Crosby. And his frustration with the franchise reportedly goes all the way to the top.\"There's a lot of fence-mending that's going to need to happen if the Raiders are going to hang onto Maxx Crosby,\" Breer said on NBC Sports Boston. \"It goes all the way to the top of the organization with Tom Brady and Alex Guerrero. The way the communication happened with the injury in December left a mark. This is a guy who's incredibly loyal to the Raiders organization, wanted to spend his entire career there, and is loyal to Mark Davis as well. Now, he feels betrayed.\"\n        \n            \n                Maxx Crosby mock trades: Five blockbuster deals that could shake up the NFL\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nYou may recognize Guerrero's name. He's been connected to Brady since his New England Patriots days as a trainer and former business partner. Now, Guerrero is listed on the Raiders' official website as the team's wellness coordinator where he \"oversees several departments to ensure and enhance the health and well-being of players, coaches, and staff.\"\nAccording to Breer, a lot of people in the organization report to Guerrero now, and he's viewed as the \"eyes and ears\" of Brady.  Where he comes into the equation with Crosby is that Guerrero was apparently part of communicating to the star pass rusher that he was being shut down. This \"really angered Maxx,\" Breer said.  Crosby also reportedly had a \"strong suspicion\" that the reason he was shut down was for the Raiders to tank for the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. Vegas was successful in doing so. \nCrosby has refused to address the noise surrounding him, saying recently on the \"Let's Go!\" podcast that he's focused on his family and training. \n\"My focus has been on getting healthy because that's all I can control right now,\" Crosby said, via NFL.com. \"That's all that matters to me is being with my daughters and being with my wife and taking care of myself. People are gonna have rumors.\"I just looked at my phone -- I've been working all morning. Everyone's hitting me up, 'Did you say this?' I can't control that. You earn that as a player. If I wasn't doing the right things and if I wasn't the person and player I was, people wouldn't be talking about all the nonsense. But that's what comes with it. If you have drama, if you have a losing season, they just try to throw gasoline on the fire and make things a certain way.\"New Raiders coach Klint Kubiak was introduced earlier this week, and he was able to meet with Crosby -- who apparently was the first player in the building working out. Kubiak could play an important role in soothing whatever tensions may exist between Crosby and the Raiders. \"We want him to be a part of our success going forward, theres no doubt about that,\" Kubiak said. \"He's one of the best players in the NFL. That's a no-brainer, to get to work with Maxx and see him continue to have success with this organization.\"Crosby is indeed one of the best players in the NFL regardless of position. Since entering the league as a fourth-round pick out of Eastern Michigan in 2019, he has recorded the most tackles for loss (133), the fifth-most QB hits (164) and sixth-most sacks (69.5) while playing the most snaps among all defensive linemen (6,112). Breer says a \"bunch of contenders\" will have interest if Crosby is made available for trade. It remains to be seen if Vegas will do that. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The offseason is no longer knocking on our front door. Instead, it's hanging out on the couch in our living rooms. With the 2025 season now in the rearview, get ready for the conversation to pivot to trades, free-agent signings and the 2026 NFL Draft in the snap of a finger. We've already begun to feel that transition, even in the lead-up to Super Bowl LX, where the status of Maxx Crosby and his tenure with the Las Vegas Raiders became a notable storyline along Radio Row.The relationship between the two sides seemed to have soured, particularly after he was shut down at the end of the regular season. Crosby was reportedly not happy with that decision, as he wanted to play out the string, and it could potentially be the straw that breaks the camel's back and leads to a departure this offseason. However, NFL Media reported on Super Bowl Sunday that both Crosby and the Raiders are in a \"great place\" as the pass rusher recovers from a meniscus repair, so there are conflicting angles regarding Crosby's true emotions as they relate to the franchise.From the Raiders' standpoint, they've noted publicly -- as recently as Klint Kubiak's introductory press conference earlier this week -- that they want to keep Crosby in Sin City.\n\"We want him to be a part of our success going forward. There's no doubt about that,\" Kubiak said. \"He's one of the best players in the NFL. That's a no-brainer, to get to work with Maxx and see him continue to have success with this organization.\"In any event, trade conversations surrounding Crosby appear likely to persist at least through the infancy of this offseason, so let's take a deeper dive into what Las Vegas could get for him in five mock trades we've cooked up. We'll then unpack whether the Raiders should trade Crosby.What could Maxx Crosby fetch on the trade market?Before we get into trade packages with prospective teams, we first need to try to figure out what Crosby could fetch on the trade market. Fortunately, we do have some precedent to work with, using the Micah Parsons trade from last summer as a guiding point. As we all remember, the Dallas Cowboys made the stunning blockbuster with the Green Bay Packers just before the season, shipping the pass rusher to Lambeau Field.\nCowboys received: 2026 first-round pick, 2027 first-round pick, DT Kenny ClarkPackers received: EDGE Micah ParsonsWith this deal in mind, we could be looking at two first-round picks and a starting-caliber player as the ceiling for Crosby. If a team wants to get crazy and go beyond what Green Bay gave up, that's its prerogative, but there are key differences between Parsons and Crosby.For starters, Parsons was younger, entering his age-26 season at the time of the trade. Crosby will be 29 at the start of next season. While both are elite players at their positions, Parsons has also been more productive. Crosby is now rehabbing after meniscus surgery, and while that shouldn't impact his availability for the 2026 season, it is something a rival general manager could use to try to lower the price tag in negotiations.Like Parsons, it wouldn't be surprising to see Crosby seek a revamped contract if or when he's traded to a new team. While he is currently under contract through the 2029 season, his guarantees dry up after 2026 (where he has $30 million guaranteed).\nThere are a lot of variables that will almost certainly impact Crosby's trade cost. If we were to put a range on it, it's plausible he could command a haul as high as Parsons (two first-round picks and a starting-caliber player), with the floor being something like a first-round pick plus either a player or a second-rounder thrown into the basket.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Philadelphia EaglesRaiders get: 2026 first-round pick (No. 23 overall), 2027 second-round pick Eagles get: EDGE Maxx CrosbyHowie Roseman is never shy about making a splash in the trade market. Oftentimes, he's leading the charge on jaw-dropping offseason moves. In fact, Roseman and the Eagles reportedly checked in with the Cowboys (!) to see if they'd trade Parsons when that saga was unfolding, which suggests they could be interested in Crosby.Philadelphia did make an in-season trade to address its pass-rushing deficiencies, landing Jaelan Phillips from the Dolphins at the deadline. Before that deal (Weeks 1-9), the Eagles ranked 14th in pressure rate and were tied for 25th in sacks. After Phillips arrived (Weeks 10-18), they jumped to sixth in pressure rate and tied for fifth in sacks.\nWith Phillips set to hit free agency, there's a possibility Philly will again be on the hunt for pass-rush help. With the franchise still in a Super Bowl window, it should be willing to part with blue-chip draft capital, including its 2026 first-round pick.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. New England PatriotsRaiders get: 2026 first-round pick (No. 31 overall), 2026 second-round pick (No. 63 overall), DT Christian BarmorePatriots get: EDGE Maxx CrosbyThis is something of a Parsons-lite trade for New England to land Crosby. The Patriots don't ship out multiple first-round picks like Dallas did, but they do send two high-caliber selections along with a starter, with defensive tackle Christian Barmore serving as this deal's Kenny Clark comp.\nNew England is fresh off a Super Bowl appearance in Year 1 of the Mike Vrabel era, but there's still work to be done on the roster. While needed improvements along the offensive line and skill positions were clear in the loss to Seattle, the club could also stand to add an impact pass rusher.The Patriots caught lightning in a bottle with K'Lavon Chaisson this season, but he's set to cash in when he hits free agency. Crosby is the type of talent who could elevate this front to another level ahead of what projects to be a far more difficult 2026 regular season.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Buffalo BillsRaiders get: 2026 first-round pick (No. 26 overall), 2027 first-round pick, WR Keon Coleman\nBills get: EDGE Maxx CrosbyIf there were a team willing to go full Parsons and send Las Vegas two first-round picks plus a player, there's a strong argument it would be Buffalo. President of football operations Brandon Beane may also be feeling enough pressure to pull the trigger.The Bills are coming off a 2025 season in which they not only missed a golden opportunity to make the Super Bowl -- with the likes of Patrick Mahomes, Lamar Jackson and Joe Burrow on the outside looking in -- but also lost ground to the Patriots, who won the AFC East. That contributed to Sean McDermott being fired and Joe Brady being elevated to head coach.Buffalo needs to improve the talent around Josh Allen, but it must also maximize the roster while its MVP quarterback remains in his prime. That includes improving a pass rush that produced the ninth-fewest pressures in 2025, according to TruMedia. When the Bills square off against Mahomes, Jackson, Burrow and Maye in 2026, they'd be glad they added a game-wrecker like Crosby -- no matter the cost.\nSpeaking of cost, one factor that could derail this blockbuster is Buffalo's salary-cap situation, as the club is currently $7.5 million over the cap. As for the Coleman component, the Raiders are thin at receiver, and the Bills' front office doesn't appear sold on the former second-round pick, making this a potential change-of-scenery fit.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Seattle SeahawksRaiders get: 2026 first-round pick (No. 32 overall), 2026 second-round pick (No. 64 overall)Seahawks get: EDGE Maxx CrosbyCould the rich get richer? The Seahawks just lifted the Lombardi Trophy, but that shouldn't prevent them from looking to improve as they gear up for a title defense.\nBoye Mafe is set to become a free agent this offseason, and if he departs, that would create a need. Seeing what Mike Macdonald could do with Crosby at his disposal -- coming off a championship season in which Seattle ranked sixth in pressure rate despite primarily rushing four -- would be borderline unfair.The Seahawks also boast a talented enough roster to feel comfortable punting on the first two rounds of the 2026 NFL Draft if it means Crosby heads to the Pacific Northwest. The organization also has $72.2 million in available cap space (sixth-highest in the NFL) to help facilitate a new deal.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. San Francisco 49ersRaiders get: 2026 first-round pick (No. 26 overall), 2026 second-round pick (No. 58 overall)\n49ers get: EDGE Maxx CrosbyThe 49ers were decimated by injuries in 2025, which seriously impacted their ability to rush the passer. Edge rushers Nick Bosa and Mykel Williams both tore ACLs, contributing to San Francisco recording the fewest sacks in the NFL (20) and the fewest sacks per game (1.8) ever by a playoff team.Of course, that unit should improve simply by getting healthier in 2026, but the club should still explore significant additions. GM John Lynch is one of the more aggressive executives in the NFL, so it wouldn't be surprising to see him dip his toe into the Crosby trade waters -- especially with his team still in a Super Bowl window while competing in one of the league's toughest divisions, which includes the defending champions.Should the Raiders trade Maxx Crosby?\nKubiak and owner Mark Davis have both stated publicly their desire to keep Crosby. However, if a team is willing to shell out premium draft picks and a possible starter to pry him out of Las Vegas, the franchise should seriously consider it.Yes, Crosby has been the fabric of the organization essentially since he arrived as a fourth-round pick in 2019, but the Raiders are about to step into a new era. They just hired a new head coach, have young pieces on offense headlined by Ashton Jeanty and Brock Bowers, and are about to draft Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza with the first overall pick later this offseason.By the time they're ready to contend with this young core, Crosby could be past his prime, so he doesn't exactly fit the timeline the organization is currently on. If they can get a king's ransom for him, they should add more assets to the cupboard to maximize the incoming Mendoza era.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        One of the hottest players in the world over the last two weeks could not be extinguished on Thursday at Pebble Beach Golf Links. Ryo Hisatsune continued to stoke the flame in his opening round of the 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, signing for a bogey-free, 10-under 62 to grab the early lead in the first signature event of the season.Hisatsune's 62 represents his lowest career round on the PGA Tour, and it comes in his tournament debut at Pebble Beach. His previous low of 63 came just last weekend at the WM Phoenix Open, where he finished in a share of 10th place. The young man from Japan rolled in more than 150 feet of putts and even chipped in for birdie on the par-4 16th to start a run of three straight into the clubhouse. His lead going into Friday, where he will play at Spyglass Hill, is just a single stroke over American Sam Burns, who was similarly on fire on the greens en route to his 63. Keegan Bradley came in late at the same number as he missed a chance on his last hole to tie the course record on Spyglass. Burns just barely led the field in strokes gained putting on Thursday, gaining more than five strokes with the wand in hand. Hisatsune cleared more than five strokes on the greens as well.\"Anytime you can go bogey-free, regardless of where you're playing, is always a good thing, and especially to do it around here,\" Burns said. \"It was nice. I made a significant amount of putts and feel like I was hitting it pretty nice. It was a good combination for today. The weather was perfect, so we were just trying to enjoy the day.\"\nPebble Beach played nearly four strokes under par in Round 1, while Spyglass Hill played roughly two strokes more difficult. While conditions were ripe for the taking, world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler struggled yet again in the opening refrain. One week after starting his tournament with a 73, his first over-par round since June 2025, the four-time major champion signed for a 72 to fall 10 strokes off the pace -- the same deficit he faced after 18 holes at the WM Phoenix Open.Over on Spyglass Hill, Bradley was the low man with a stellar 9-under performance. The most recent U.S. Ryder Cup captain appears to have found something, while Jordan Spieth showed signs of life with a bogey-free 66. Meanwhile, last year's champion, Rory McIlroy, ran into some speed bumps on the greens and signed for a 68 to open up his title defense despite a pair of double bogeys.\nLeader1. Ryo Hisatsune (-10): The experience is beginning to stack up for the 23-year-old. Hisatsune was a member of the final group at Torrey Pines on Sunday, where he finished runner-up to Justin Rose, and he was in the final group on Saturday at the WM Phoenix Open alongside his golf hero, Hideki Matsuyama, before ultimately cashing a top 10 finish. Playing with serious confidence, the right-hander wielded the putter effectively in Round 1, cashing putts from 42, 31, 17, 16, 13 and 12 feet.  He noted that he loves putting on these poa annua putting surfaces, but his ball-striking will need to improve over the next 54 holes if he is to turn this momentum into his first victory on the PGA Tour.ContendersT2. Sam Burns, Keegan Bradley (-9)T4. Chris Gotterup, Tony Finau, Patrick Rodgers (-8)T7. Nick Taylor, Akshay Bhatia, Andrew Novak, Tom Hoge (-7)T11. Russell Henley, Jake Knapp, Jordan Spieth, Sepp Straka, Rickie Fowler, Matt Fitzpatrick, Patrick Cantlay, Mackenzie Hughes (-6)Lot of big names on the first and second pages of the leaderboard, including Gotterup, who has already won twice this season, but it is hard not to notice what Spieth accomplished on Spyglass. Not only did he hole out for eagle on the par-4 9th, he also managed his way around the par 72 without dropping a shot, maintaining the momentum he had garnered. The reason? Spieth's putting from close range. Typically good for one miss from near distance, Spieth was solid inside 10 feet and added makes from 14 and 12 feet, the latter coming on the last hole to save par and maintain his bogey-free round.\n\"I thought I was really good on and around the greens,\" Spieth said. \"I actually didn't hit many greens for how kind of well I thought I was swinging the club. I pulled a few kind of the wrong clubs. It's easy to do out here. You can pull a club you think's going to go far enough, and it just doesn't go anywhere here. So I've got to get a little tighter on some of that decision making, but when I got into trouble, I got out of trouble. \"Obviously, holing a wedge shot was probably the highlight of the day. But I just really plotted my way around. When I missed, I missed in the right spot. I'd like to get a little bit tighter as we go around Pebble, but at Spyglass 6 under may be the best I ever shot around here, so, very pleased.\"\nScheffler's strugglesFor the second straight week, Scheffler will attempt to mount a comeback from 10 strokes down across the final 54 holes of a tournament. While at the WM Phoenix Open he was upended by one hour out of an otherwise decent round, Scheffler's first round at Pebble Beach was more of a slow bleed. He missed birdie chances from 8 feet on Nos. 1-2, connected from that distance on No. 4 and then gave it back from 4 feet on No. 5. A birdie flew onto his scorecard on the par-5 6th after nearly finding the surface in two, but that was his last birdie until the last hole of the day.\nIn between them, Scheffler continued to struggle with the putter -- he missed a par putt from just inside 3 feet on No. 12 -- but it was the iron play that was uncharacteristically poor. He lost about 2.50 strokes on approach, ranked 73rd in the 80-man field in that category and failed to give himself looks from hole high consistently -- a rarity in his game.2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am updated odds, picksOdds via DraftKings SportsbookKeegan Bradley: 8-1Chris Gotterup: 19/2Sam Burns: 10-1Ryo Hisatsune: 13-1Matt Fitzpatrick: 17-1Rory McIlroy: 17-1Jake Knapp: 18-1Patrick Rodgers: 18-1For those wondering, Scheffler is listed at 35-1, a far cry from the 3-1 price tag at tournament open. No suggestion either way here, but a 65 seems certain on Friday. McIlroy may ultimately be the guy, though, as he left so many strokes out there on the greens and still managed to beat the scoring average on Spyglass by a couple of strokes. The return to his blades looked like a smart move, at least on Thursday.\n            ",

Team USA had to shake off the rust before wearing down the Latvians over the final two periods in a dominant effort.The opening 20 minutes weren't terribly impressive as the U.S. and Latvia went into the first intermission tied at 1-1. Team USA had two goals overturned due to coach's challenges, and it hit three posts while also making some uncharacteristic mistakes.The U.S. turned up the heat right from the opening puck drop of the second period, and it was all Team USA in the final 40 minutes. The Americans had the Latvians running around in their own zone for the entire second period, and Brock Nelson managed to bury a couple of goals.\nNelson was one of the game's standouts with his two goals, but Jack Hughes and Quinn Hughes (two assists each) were also littered throughout the scoresheet. Another positive for the Americans was the chemistry between Matthew and Brady Tkachuk as the brothers combined to open the scoring.There was a lot to like about Team USA's game, especially the last two periods. The passing got cleaner as the game progressed, the power play tallied two goals and the forecheck was extremely effective. This won't be the Americans' biggest test of the tournament, but it was a good start nonetheless.The Americans will try to build upon this strong start when they face Denmark in their second of three preliminary round games.\nU.S. men's hockey scheduleAll times EasternPreliminary roundThursday, Feb. 12: USA 5, Latvia 1USA vs. Denmark | Saturday, Feb. 14 | 3:10 p.m. | USA NetworkUSA vs. Germany | Sunday, Feb. 15 | 3:10 p.m. | USA NetworkQuarterfinalTBD vs. TBD | Wednesday, Feb. 18 | 3:10 p.m. | TBDSemifinalTBD vs. TBD | Friday, Feb. 20 | 3:10 p.m. | TBDBronze medal game\nTBD vs. TBD | Saturday, Feb. 21 | 2:10 p.m. | TBDGold medal gameTBD vs. TBD | Sunday, Feb. 22 | 8:10 a.m. | TBD\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The current DraftKings promo code gives new users $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins. Thursday features a three-game NBA slate that features LeBron James in action as the Los Angeles Lakers host the Dallas Mavericks at 10 p.m. ET. Although James will play in the NBA All-Star Game, he'll have time to rest after Thursday, which could lead to more minutes and larger usage. With James active and the Mavericks without multiple players, including Cooper Flagg (foot), the SportsLine Projection Model backs the Lakers to cover as 7.5-point favorites as one of its Thursday NBA best bets at DraftKings. The over/under for Lakers vs. Mavericks is 235.5, the highest total on Thursday's NBA odds board. The model is also backing the Oklahoma City Thunder to cover as 13.5-point favorites against the Milwaukee Bucks in a 7:30 p.m. ET matchup that will not feature Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (abdominal) or Giannis Antetokounmpo (calf).

They've won two of those three games by at least 27 points, with an average margin of victory of 24 points in the three wins. Oklahoma City is coming off a 136-109 win over the Suns on Wednesday to improve to 42-13 this season. Meanwhile, the Bucks are 4-4 in their eight games with Giannis Antetokounmpo out, but 1-3 against teams with a winning record. The model projects the Thunder to cover in 64% of simulations. Back the Thunder to cover at DraftKings here:Northern Iowa (+5.5) vs. Belmont (-118)\"Belmont saw its nine-game win streak snapped in an OT loss at Bradley, and now the Bruins return home to face a Northern Iowa team they dismantled by 13 in Cedar Falls,\" SportsLine expert Larry Hartstein said. \"But Northern Iowa is playing much better now. The Panthers just destroyed Murray State, the MVC's second-place team, 89-60 on the road, for their third straight win. None of Northern Iowa's last four opponents has scored more than 60 points. While the Bruins are highly efficient offensively, the Panthers hold opponents to 26.5 percent from deep. Northern Iowa has been an underdog six times this season. The Panthers have covered five of those -- the miss coming by 1.5 points at Bradley -- and beaten market expectations by an average of 8.2 points.\" Back Northern Iowa to cover at DraftKings here:Lakers (-7.5) vs. Mavericks (-112)This Dallas Mavericks lineup is certainly not what NBA fans expected to see on display at the start of the season. The Mavericks still haven't seen Kyrie Irving this season, who remains out with a knee injury. They traded away Anthony Davis. And now, No. 1 pick Cooper Flagg, who has dominated lately, is out with a foot injury. The Lakers aren't at full strength either, with Luka Doncic (hamstring) out, but only Doncic and Deandre Ayton (knee, questionable) are on the LA injury report. Meanwhile, Dallas has eight players on its injury report as either questionable, doubtful or out. LeBron James should be additionally rested, as he hasn't played since Monday, and could take on a larger role with the upcoming break. The Lakers are 32-21 compared to the Mavericks at 19-34 this season, and the model projects the Lakers to cover in 67% of simulations.\" Back the Lakers to cover at DraftKings here:\nWant more NBA, college basketball picks on Thursday?You've seen some of the model's Thursday best bets.

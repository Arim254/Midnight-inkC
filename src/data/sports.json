    "body": "\n        A cross-conference NFL Week 14 matchup has the Los Angeles Chargers hosting the Philadelphia Eagles on 'Monday Night Football' at 8:15 p.m. ET. A MNF SGP could consist of NFL picks on the money line, and the Chargers have won five of their last six home games versus the Eagles. Philadelphia is a 2.5-point favorite and the over/under is 41.5, per the latest Eagles vs. Chargers odds, with spread and total picks also being popular bets to include in NFL same-game parlays. Many will also go the route of including prop picks, with the likes of Jalen Hurts, Saquon Barkley, Keenan Allen and Ladd McConkey top players to target, especially with the questionable tag on Justin Herbert (hand) and Omarion Hampton (ankle).Hurts and Barkley have similar NFL prop odds as an anytime touchdown scorer with Barkley at +105 and Hurts at +110. Neither found the end zone last week, however, while Hampton (+190), who was activated from the IR on Monday, has the shortest odds to score amongst Chargers. Adding a plus-money NFL prop like this could result in a huge payday on your MNF same-game parlay.

Brown goes Under 61.5 receiving yards (-112). With Philly's offensive struggles, Brown is having the worst season of his career as his 63.5 receiving yards per game are the lowest of his seven NFL seasons. While he's found success against poor teams, that hasn't been the case against the league's better squads. Brown hasn't even reached 50 receiving yards in four of his last five versus teams that currently have winning records.The 8-4 Chargers fit the bill, and they will be the best pass defense that the Eagles have seen all year. L.A. ranks second versus the pass as it is built to prevent big days from wide receivers. Only one wideout has had more than 46 receiving yards versus the Chargers over the last four games. Brown is projected to have 52.2 receiving yards on average, as this NFL prop rated 4.5 stars could be a part of a winning 'Monday Night Football' SGP. See which other MNF same-game parlay picks to make here, and bet this prop here:How to make Eagles vs. Chargers SGP picksIn addition, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model has two other NFL props that are rated 4.5 stars or better that could be a part of your Chargers vs. Eagles SGP picks. You can only see the Machine Learning Model's Monday Night Football NFL parlay at SportsLine.What are the model's top same-game parlay picks you should target with your Eagles vs. Chargers predictions?

Challenging fights have been few and far between for Chimaev, who exploded onto the scene with two wins in 10 days at \"Fight Island\" in July 2020.Chimaev bounced between welterweight and middleweight until settling in at 185 pounds, where he defeated former welterweight champion Kamaru Usman and former middleweight champ Robert Whittaker before his championship-grabbing performance against Du Plessis.\"These [middleweight] fights don't make me excited, but I need to do my job,\" Chimaev said. \"I need to make money. If there is a big name to make more money, then I will be excited. If you get $3 million for a fight, but then you have a good [opponent], and you make $6 million, of course you'll be excited.\"\nRather than return to welterweight in pursuit of a second belt, Chimaev said that a move to light heavyweight would follow his first middleweight title defense, with designs on a bout with two-time -- and current -- 205-pound champion Alex Pereira.\"That's a good fight for me,\" Chimaev said of facing Pereira. \"Everyone knows that. The UFC knows that. The UFC doesn't want to give me this guy. And this guy said, 'Oh, I'll come to you and [have a grappling match].' Grappling is not our job. UFC is our job. He said he could fight Du Plessis [when Du Plessis was the champion], he accepted that fight. But now he says, 'Khamzat is not a good fight for me.'\"\nPereira comes from a kickboxing background, and while he has developed decent takedown defense, wrestling is still likely the weakest dimension of his game. Chimaev averages 5.29 takedowns per 15 minutes of Octagon time, making the perspective of a smaller man with tremendous wrestling against the thunderous strikes of Pereira an intriguing potential fight.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Kansas City Chiefs spent the better part of a decade treating the AFC playoff race as a formality. This year, it became a weekly math problem, and the numbers don't lie. Sunday night's 20-10 loss to the Houston Texans dropped Kansas City to 6-7, pushing the franchise into unfamiliar territory: 10th place in the AFC with four games remaining and below .500 in December for the first time since 2012. The defeat also ended the Chiefs' run of nine straight AFC West titles. Patrick Mahomes didn't hide the reality of the moment.\"We know the (playoff) chances are getting lower and lower, but I know the guys on this team are going to give everything they have, every opportunity we get,\" Mahomes said. Kansas City's night unraveled in familiar fashion. Drives stalled, chances slipped away and the Chiefs' offense never found a rhythm. Mahomes finished with just 160 passing yards on 14-of-33 throwing with three picks -- a stat line shaped as much by his own miscues as by the help he never received. The Chiefs dropped six passes, including one from Travis Kelce in the fourth quarter that deflected into the arms of Texans linebacker Azeez Al-Shaair, and another from Rashee Rice on a must-have fourth-and-4.The protection issues were just as damaging. Kansas City entered the game already patching together an offensive line with three starters unavailable, then lost tackle Wanya Morris on the first snap. On the other side of the ball, cornerback Trent McDuffie exited after suffering a knee injury following a 46-yard completion to Nico Collins. With the lineup thinning, Houston consistently collapsed the pocket, pressuring Mahomes on roughly half of his dropbacks and contributing to what became the lowest passer rating of his career.\n\"They are upset,\" Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. \"They put it all out there and it didn't work out for them. The guys that had some mishaps, they [are] upset. These guys take responsibility for things.\"Mahomes has never missed the NFL postseason.\"I know we're not winning games, but that mindset the guys have in this locker room, in the games that we're not winning, you can never question the fight of this team,\" Mahomes said. \"Obviously, we're not executing at the right moments and we're not making those plays, but at the end of the day you can never question that, and I think you'll see that for these last four weeks.\"Kansas City's path back to the playoffs is narrow, but not impossible. The Chiefs close the season with home games against AFC West rivals Denver Broncos (11-2) and Los Angeles Chargers (8-4), and road contests against struggling Tennessee Titans (2-11) and Las Vegas Raiders (2-11).\nTo keep their postseason chances alive, they will need to win out and hope the Wild Card teams ahead of them stumble.\n            ",

The Buccaneers have signed defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul to their practice squad following a workout with team, according to Ian Rapoport.The 36-year-old Pierre-Paul hasn't played in the NFL since Dec. 11, 2023, when he was a member of the Miami Dolphins. The Dolphins waved Pierre-Paul shortly after that game.Pierre-Paul does have experience in Tampa, spending four seasons there 2018-21. As a member of the Bucs, Pierre-Paul won Super Bowl LV and recorded two sacks in the NFC Championship Game against the Green Bay Packers. In his first stint with Tampa Bay, Pierre-Paul totaled 131 tackles, 35 tackles for loss and 33 sacks.\nFollowing the 2021 season, Pierre-Paul spent one year with the Baltimore Ravens in 2022 before splitting time with the New Orleans Saints and Dolphins in 2023.Prior to joining the Bucs, Pierre-Paul was a star for the New York Giants from 2010-17. In that time, Pierre-Paul earned first-team All-Pro honors and was named to the Pro Bowl roster twice. In 2011, Pierre-Paul and the rest of the defensive line powered the Giants to a Super Bowl LXVI win over the New England Patriots.\nIn his 14-year NFL career, Pierre-Paul has amassed 631 tackles, 127 tackles for loss and 94.5 sacks.\n            \n    ",

Now 8-5 and without their starting quarterback, it's no longer a given the Colts make the postseason. Jones' replacement, the rookie Riley Leonard, isn't 100% healthy either.According to ESPN, Leonard is dealing with a strained knee ligament that has him \"week to week.\" The Colts are uncertain if he will be able to start on Sunday against the Seattle Seahawks. Coach Shane Steichen told reporters Monday that Leonard is dealing with a right knee injury, but that he will \"hopefully\" be available for Week 15. How Leonard fares in practice this week should determine whether he makes his first career start.With Anthony Richardson still on injured reserve after fracturing his orbital bone, and Leonard nursing a banged-up knee, the only other quarterback the Colts have is Brett Rypien, who is on the practice squad. It's a reason why the Colts are bringing in 44-year-old Philip Rivers for a workout. Rivers was the last quarterback to lead the Colts to the playoffs, as he went 11-5 in his one season with Indy back in 2020.  As for Leonard, he completed 18 of 29 passes for 145 yards and one interception in his first extensive NFL action on Sunday, and also rushed for a touchdown. The sixth-round pick out of Notre Dame led the Fighting Irish to the College Football Playoff National Championship game last year, where they fell to the Ohio State Buckeyes. In 16 games played, he completed 66.7% of his passes for 2,861 yards, 21 touchdowns and eight interceptions. Leonard also racked up 906 yards and a whopping 17 touchdowns on the ground.\nThe Colts have one of the toughest remaining schedules in the NFL. After playing in Seattle, they host the San Francisco 49ers in Week 16 and the Jaguars in Week 17, before finishing the season in Houston against the Texans. According to SportsLine, the Colts have a 6.7% chance to win the division, and 45.7% chance to make the playoffs.\n            \n    ",

The New England Patriots' Dec. 21 road game against the Baltimore Ravens has been flexed into the Sunday night spot, while the Cincinnati Bengals' showdown in Miami against the Dolphins has been moved from Sunday night to a 1 p.m. ET kickoff. Obviously, the records of each of the teams influenced the league's decision. At 11-2, the Patriots currently have the league's best record and are vying to secure the AFC's top seed heading into the playoffs. And while the Ravens are a disappointing 6-7, they are just a game behind the Steelers for first place in the AFC North following this past Sunday's loss to Pittsburgh. Miami and Cincinnati are technically still alive as far as making the playoffs, neither team has a winning record through the season's first 14 weeks. The Dolphins enter next Monday night's game against the Steelers with a 6-7 record after winning their last four games. Cincinnati is 4-9 after losing a hard-fought game this past Sunday against the Bills, who are trying to catch New England in the AFC East standings. \nRecords aside, the Bengals-Dolphins game should still have plenty of intrigue as it involves the first two quarterbacks selected in the 2020 NFL Draft in Joe Burrow and Tua Tagovailoa. Burrow's career so far has included one trip to the Super Bowl and two Comeback Player of the Year awards. Tagovailoa's highlights in Miami includes a passing title in 2023 and being the league's leader in completion percentage last year. Both quarterbacks have battled through various injuries during their first six seasons as well. New England's matchup with Baltimore will also feature two high-profile quarterbacks in Drake Maye and Lamar Jackson. Jackson is a two-time league MVP, while Maye and Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford are the front-runners to possibly win the award this year. \nWeek 16 will mark the fourth prime time game this season for the Patriots, who are on the precipice of clinching their first playoff berth since 2021. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Indianapolis Colts' 2025 season is in danger of ending on a sour note, as quarterback Daniel Jones went down with a torn Achilles in Sunday's loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars. With the division and a playoff spot on the line, the 8-5 Colts are considering bringing back the quarterback that started for them the last time Indianapolis made the postseason.According to CBS Sports NFL Insider Jonathan Jones, the Colts are hosting Philip Rivers for a workout this week to see if he could potentially join their roster. Rivers turned 44 years old on Monday, and was named a semifinalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fame just last month.If Rivers, who is now a grandfather, were to sign with the Colts, he would join a new-look quarterback room headlined by rookie Riley Leonard and Brett Rypien. Rivers' oldest child, Halle, is a few months older than Leonard. There are four quarterbacks 44 or older to start an NFL game: Tom Brady, Vinny Testaverde, Warren Moon and Steve DeBerg. Next Sunday, it will have been 1,800 days, or almost five years, since Rivers last took a snap in an NFL game, according to CBS Sports Research. \nOldest starting quarterbacks in NFL historyAgeTeamSeasonTom Brady45 years, 5 months, 13 daysBuccaneers2022Steve DeBerg44 years, 9 months, 6 daysFalcons1998Vinny Testaverde44 years, 26 daysPanthers2007Warren Moon44 years, 8 daysChiefs 2000Doug Flutie 42 years, 2 months, 10 days Chargers 2004Rivers last played in 2020 for the Colts. He led Indy to an 11-5 record and a playoff berth, while throwing for 4,169 yards, 24 touchdowns and 11 interceptions. The former No. 4 overall pick in the 2004 NFL Draft spent 16 of his 17 NFL seasons with the San Diego-turned Los Angeles Chargers. An eight-time Pro Bowl quarterback, Rivers went 134-106 as a starter, and currently ranks seventh all-time in passing yards (63,440) and sixth in touchdown passes (421). How would this impact Rivers' Hall of Fame eligibility?For the first time, Rivers is eligible for induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He was recently among the 26 modern-era candidates who made the cut as semifinalists. Drew Brees and fellow 2004 draftee Eli Manning are the other modern-era quarterbacks who are currently eligible for enshrinement next summer in Canton, Ohio. The Hall of Fame requires a player to be retired for five seasons before he is eligible for induction. Under those rules, Rivers would no longer be eligible for induction this year should be choose to sign with the Colts. If his plays this season, Rivers' Hall of Fame eligibility would reset, meaning he wouldn't be eligible for induction until 2031. This offseason, Rivers said on the \"Dan Patrick Show\" that he was receiving interest from teams in 2021 and 2022. The New Orleans Saints even called Rivers and Drew Brees in 2021. \"The reason there was a little bit of a wait is there were a couple of November/Decembers there in 2021 and 2022 where I was staying ready,\" Rivers said. \"I threw on shoulder pads a few times and a helmet and was throwing in the yard and working just in case. And there were a few things that kind of got close. But then the last two years I pretty much knew I was done.\"However, it would appear Rivers is not 100% done. There's still work to be done and hurdles to clear, but there appears to be legitimate mutual interest between Rivers and the Colts. \n            ",

The American captain did not travel with the team on Sunday due to a flu, and only joined the squad on Monday, just a few hours before kickoff at the Stadio Olimpico in Turin.\nTwo key goals against Torino after the home side scored the opening two goals with Nikola Vlasic and Duvan Zapata before a stunning goal from outside the box scored by Adrien Rabiot before halftime. Pulisic came off from the bench at the 66th minute of the game and scored his first goal one minute after entering the pitch, and ten minutes later scored his 9th goal of the season. It was another great night for Pulisic, who is now aiming to secure his first Serie A title with AC Milan.

    "body": "\n        The 2025 Heisman Trophy finalists were announced on Monday and the list of stars headed to New York features some of the best and brightest from a particularly chaotic football season. Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza, Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia, Ohio State quarterback Julian Sayin and Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love will all take center stage during Saturday's ceremony, which is set to begin at 8 p.m. ET, but only one will be crowned as the 80th Heisman Trophy winner. It certainly seems like a quarterback will be taking the Heisman Trophy home this year after Colorado two-way star Travis Hunter broke the streak of three straight quarterback winners last season. Mendoza and Pavia are the two favorites to win the award now that most votes have been cast following championship game weekend. Though a quarterback winning the Heisman is nothing new, it would still be a historic triumph for either Mendoza or Pavia -- neither Indiana nor Vanderbilt have ever produced a Heisman winner. Neither Sayin nor Love should be entirely discounted. Sayin started at quarterback for the best team in college football -- entering the Big Ten Championship Game, at least -- and Love is one of the most talented running backs to pass through Notre Dame in the modern era.Here's a more detailed look at the four players who made the cut for the 2025 Heisman Trophy. \nFernando Mendoza, QB, Indiana Mendoza is now the heavy favorite to win the Heisman Trophy after his heroic performance in Indiana's Big Ten Championship Game win against Ohio State. Mendoza helped the Hoosiers capture their first outright conference title in 80 years with 15 completions for 222 yards and one touchdown. He effectively sealed the 13-10 victory with a perfectly placed 33-yard pass to wide receiver Charlie Becker that converted a third-and-6 with just over two minutes to play. Mendoza also orchestrated the crucial 88-yard touchdown drive in which he completed passes of 51 yards and 17 yards for the decisive score. That brought his stats on the year to a respectable 2,980 yards and 33 touchdowns through the air. He also rushed for six touchdowns. Mendoza won't win because of the box score, though, but more for his impact in leading a historically deficient program to new heights. Diego Pavia, QB, VanderbiltSpeaking of leading programs that have struggled historically, Pavia is the engine behind Vanderbilt's modern Renaissance under coach Clark Lea. He's emerged as one of the nation's premier playmakers -- akin to Johnny Manziel and the freestyling gunslingers of yore -- and his hot close to the season has him on the precipice of winning college football's most prestigious individual award. He averaged a whopping 455.8 total yards of offense and was responsible for 16 touchdowns in Vanderbilt's last four games. He rushed for 165 yards on 8.3 yards per carry in Vanderbilt's regular season finale against Tennessee, which helped propel the Commodores to their first win against their in-state rival since 2018. Julian Sayin, QB, Ohio State Sayin's Heisman outlook seems to have faded in the wake of Ohio State's Big Ten Championship Game loss, though he turned in a solid 258-yard, one-touchdown performance. That also marked the 11th game this season in which he completed at least 70% of his passes. It should come as no surprise that his 78.4% completion rate leads all FBS quarterbacks. As does his 182.1 passer rating among quarterbacks that have thrown the ball at least 100 times this season. Sayin has at least one more year before he's eligible for the NFL Draft, so there's a good chance this won't be the last time he's involved in the Heisman conversation. \nJeremiyah Love, RB, Notre Dame Love most likely won't win the Heisman, but he certainly belongs at the ceremony. He's powered Notre Dame's offense all season long as one of the most explosive runners in college football. Love is one of just two running backs at the FBS level with at least 1,000 yards rushing on 6.9 yards per carry. His eight-carry, 171-yard performance in Notre Dame's 70-7 win against Syracuse was one of the best rushing performances all season. It's also rather typical of what Love accomplished with the Fighting Irish.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Mike Tomlin had plenty of reasons to blow a kiss to the CBS camera after the Steelers' 27-22 win over the Ravens on Sunday.The win came one week after he heard \"Fire Tomlin\" chants during a 23-6 home loss to the Bills. He spent the week addressing his future, hearing reports and speculation about his future and even hearing his former Super Bowl-winning quarterback suggest, \"Maybe it's time to clean house.\"The win came despite the Steelers being outgained by more than 100 yards.But most importantly, the win took the Steelers from seemingly on the brink to in the driver's seat in the AFC North with four weeks to play. Tomlin has famously -- or infamously -- never had a losing record, and games like this one are why. The Steelers are 7-6, the win having stopped a two-game losing streak.\"Awesome team win,\" Tomlin said. \"I'm just appreciative of the effort of the men in that locker room. It's classic Steelers vs. Ravens. ... [I] appreciate the efforts. Big win for us, obviously, in a hostile environment, and we'll keep moving.\"\nThey certainly will keep it moving; they have no other choice. The Steelers lead the Ravens by one game and, crucially, have the head-to-head tiebreaker. They also know all too well how quickly things can slip the other way. Last year, the Steelers blew a two-game AFC North lead with four weeks to go.As we turn our attention to Week 15, the stage only gets brighter and the road to January, for many teams, officially begins now. Can they avoid a similar fate this year?\n        \n            \n                Ravens lose to Steelers in controversial finish, but have no one to blame but themselves as season nears brink\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nCurrent AFC North standings, odds projectionsHere's how the Steelers and Ravens measure up in the AFC North, plus the top two tiebreakers if the teams end up with the same record.\nW-LTiebreaker 1:   Head-to-headTiebreaker 2:   Division W-L      1.

(The 4-9 Bengals have a 3% chance.)Furthermore, the Steelers are -185 to make the playoffs at DraftKings Sportsbook (+150 to miss); the Ravens are +185 to make the playoffs (-230 to miss). Those may seem like surprising numbers given it's only a one-game lead for Pittsburgh and there's still a head-to-head meeting remaining, but another reason for Pittsburgh's significant advantage is ...Remaining schedule for Steelers, RavensPittsburgh faces a significantly easier schedule to finish.Remaining schedule with opponent W-LSteelersRavensWeek 15vs. Dolphins (6-7)at Bengals (4-9)Week 16at Lions (8-5)vs. Patriots (11-2)Week 17at Browns (3-10)at Packers (9-3-1)Week 18vs. Ravens (6-7)at Steelers (7-6)The Ravens have the sixth-toughest schedule remaining (.606 opponent win percentage); the Steelers have the seventh-easiest (.442 opponent win percentage).Bet Steelers and Ravens games at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if their first bet of at least $5 wins.How can the Ravens win the AFC North?Not all is lost yet for Baltimore, as 24% is not nothing. Here are the ways Baltimore can still win the AFC North:Win out.Beat Bengals, Steelers and one of Packers or Patriots; Steelers lose one of three other remaining games.Beat Bengals and Steelers, lose to Packers and Patriots; Steelers lose two of three other remaining games.Lose to Bengals, beat Packers, Patriots, Steelers; Steelers lose out.Beat Bengals, Packers, Patriots; Steelers lose next three games. (In this case, the Ravens would clinch the AFC North even before playing the Steelers in Week 18.)Lose to Bengals and one of Patriots/Packers, beat Steelers; Steelers lose two of three other remaining games; Bengals lose at least one more game.Beat Steelers and lose other three games; Steelers lose out; Bengals lose at least two more games.Needless to say, the Ravens are big Dolphins fans this weekend, followed by the Lions in Week 16 and the Browns in Week 17.Can either team claim a wild card bid?The short answer is it's extremely unlikely. The AFC Wild Card race currently features four teams with at least eight wins, meaning the Steelers' or Ravens' best chance, by far, is by winning the division.AFC wild card standingsW-L5. Bills9-46.

    "body": "\n        When the final College Football Playoff rankings were announced, Notre Dame saw its postseason hopes dissolve. Alabama remained at No. 9 after getting blasted in the SEC Championship. Despite both teams being idle, Miami jumped the Irish for the No. 10 spot after weeks of being ranked behind them. It was both shocking and somewhat predictable, as there was never going to be an acceptable outcome given the way the committee handled this situation all year. Notre Dame felt bamboozled by a number of parties; the committee; the CFP's TV partner, ESPN; and the ACC. As a result, Notre Dame declined all bowl bids, a move some believe was a bit of a parting shot at ESPN, which broadcasts and operates most bowl games. Pete Bevacqua, the school's athletic director, has been making the rounds to voice Notre Dame's displeasure with the situation. He joined the Dan Patrick Show Monday where he addressed the ACC's role in the situation.\"We have no gripes about any of the schools in the ACC. But we were mystified by the actions of the conference to attack their biggest business partner in football and a member of their conference in 24 of our other sports,\" Bevacqua said. \"And I wouldn't be honest with you if I didn't say that they've certainly done permanent damage between the conference and Notre Dame.\"\n\"Just we didn't appreciate the fact that we were singled out repeatedly and compared to Miami,\" Bevacqua explained when asked to elaborate. \"Not by Miami -- Miami has every right to do that -- but it raised a lot of eyebrows here that the conference was taking shots at us.\" The relationship between Notre Dame and the ACC certainly complicated matters here, but when push came to shove, there was never a world where the ACC wouldn't back one of their actual member programs in favor of a \"business partner,\" as Bevacqua put it.ACC commissioner Jim Phillips said as much in a statement on Monday.\"The University of Notre Dame is an incredibly valued member of the ACC and there is tremendous respect and appreciation for the entire institution,\" Phillips said. \"With that said, when it comes to football, we have a responsibility to support and advocate for all 17 of our football-playing member institutions, and I stand behind our conference efforts to do just that leading up to the College Football Playoff Committee selections on Sunday.\n\"At no time was it suggested by the ACC that Notre Dame was not a worthy candidate for inclusion in the field. We are thrilled for the University of Miami while also understanding and appreciating the significant disappointment of the Notre Dame players, coaches and program.\"Notre Dame is an ACC member in most other sports. In football, they have a deal to play five games per season against ACC teams while retaining their beloved independency. They recently added a long-term scheduling agreement with Clemson to play each year from 2027-38 that raised some questions among other ACC programs about how that will impact the Irish's agreement, and it seems there is some serious tension building within their partnership. As for what the ramifications are for the \"permanent damage\" Bevacqua claims has been done by the ACC stumping for the Canes, that's not abundantly clear. Perhaps the Irish will look to solidify more scheduling deals with the ACC's biggest programs, frustrating others who could lose home games with Notre Dame that would be huge revenue drivers. \nThe biggest problem Notre Dame should have with the ACC is that they could have avoided this debacle with a better tiebreaker policy to put the highest ranked teams in the ACC title game. Miami winning the ACC would have kept Notre Dame in the field as the final at-large team, but instead the Canes watched as their old friend Manny Diaz and Duke win an ACC title before them. All of this will become a moot issue next year when Notre Dame's MOU with the Playoff kicks in and they're guaranteed a spot if they rank inside the top 12. That doesn't help the Irish this year, and in the meantime they're searching for anyone to blame other than themselves for losing their first two games against their two best opponents. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        On January 1, 1902, Michigan and Stanford met in the Tournament East-West Game. The game, which Michigan won 49-0, was the first of its kind: a postseason invitational game between two schools that played in different leagues. In other words, it was a bowl game. It was the first of its kind, and also the last of its kind, until 1916, when the game became an annual event. It's now a tradition that has carried on for over 100 years. The Tournament East-West Game continues too. It changed its name to The Rose Bowl in 1923.Bowls have been around nearly as long as the sport of college football itself, but it seems their time is nearing an end. It wasn't long ago when players began opting out of bowl games to preserve their health and future value as athletes, but the first ones to do it were the players likely to be high draft picks. Then the mid-round players joined in.Now teams are doing it. Kansas State and Iowa State received $500,000 fines from the Big 12 for opting out of bowl games this year. Both teams felt that, in the wake of losing their coaches and transitioning to new leadership, they had better ways to spend their time than preparing for a bowl game with a makeshift coaching staff and a roster full of players uncertain about what their futures held for them at the college level.Then Notre Dame joined in on the fun. The Fighting Irish, caught up in their feelings over being left out of the College Football Playoff, made the decision to end their season altogether. They took on the posture of righteous indignation, but who among us hasn't been guilty of telling themselves anything they have to in order to justify their feelings?\n\n        \n            \n                Ranking all 41 college football bowl games for 2025-26: Cotton, Rose offer CFP buzz, Pinstripe spikes rest\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nRegardless of the motivation or how anybody feels about it, what matters is the precedent set by the schools. The first player to opt out of a game let other players know it was OK to do so, and more followed suit. More programs will too.Now, to be clear, this won't become the norm. I don't think we'll see a bunch of bowl-eligible teams opting out in the coming years, at least not the 10-2 ones. It will mostly be teams dealing with changes in leadership, but the more teams that skip out on bowls, the more we'll realize how little the bowls matter now. For many college football fans, bowls have always been part of the experience. Events as fundamental to the sport as bands playing fight songs, tailgates and rivalry trophies. But most of those traditions have been warped and chipped away at by the College Football Playoff. The desire to maximize revenue and create an enticing product has destroyed the conferences most of those same fans grew up with. Bowls are no different. The College Football Playoff has damaged the value of the bowl games more than players opting out of them ever could.\nBowls had already begun to lose some of their best available options to the playoff when it expanded to 12 teams. That's eight more teams they no longer got to choose from for their games. Tack on more schools opting out of games, and the pool of available teams becomes even thinner, which makes the games less attractive as television properties, which makes people sitting in boardrooms begin wondering if there are better ways to fill those blocs of television.Maybe they can put on a rankings show instead? It'll be great. They can rank teams in any order they choose and then come up with arbitrary reasons why they did so. Then, later in the show, they can just change them. Think of the engagement it could get on social media!Anyway, a further threat to the bowls is the unending specter of further playoff expansion. Nobody believes the playoff will remain at 12 teams, and the \"controversy\" around this year's playoff field will only lead to louder cries for expansion. Because if there's anything we've learned about college football's postseason, it's that putting more teams in the playoff fixes all the problems. Once they take that bad boy to 16 teams, that's four fewer teams available. And that's assuming they stop at 16. Let's not forget there have been 24-team proposals floated in recent months, too.\nWhen the playoff does expand, how many of its new games will be played at neutral sites? You think the teams that earn byes in the current format don't look at the teams who get to host first-round playoff games and think about how nice it would be to have that money too? The future of the College Football Playoff doesn't include more teams, but more games played on campus, too, because everybody will want a taste of the action. This is a good thing. Playoff games on campus make for an incredible environment, and incredible environments make for awesome television.But it won't be nearly as awesome for the bowls. At least, not the ones who aren't part of the rotation as host sites in the later rounds of the new playoff. So, if you're a fan of bowl games, enjoy them while you can. They won't be around too much longer.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Teams hoping to finally put together a winning streak will meet on 'Monday Night Football' as the San Francisco 49ers host the Carolina Panthers. San Fran (7-4) has alternated wins and losses over its last nine games and is coming off a 41-22 victory over Arizona in Week 11. Carolina (6-5) has alternated wins and losses over its last five contests, most recently knocking off Atlanta, 30-27 in overtime, on Sunday. The Niners entered NFL Week 12 ranked seventh in the NFC standings, with the Panthers ninth. Linebackers Christian Rozeboom (hip/hamstring) and Trevin Wallace (shoulder) along with center Cade Mays (ankle) are out for Carolina. Kicker Eddy Pineiro (hamstring) and linebacker Tatum Bethune (ankle) are out for the Niners. Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif. The Niners have won the last two matchups, with the most recent meeting coming in 2022. San Francisco is the 7.5-point favorite in the latest Panthers vs. 49ers odds, while the over/under for total points scored is 49.5. Before making any 49ers vs. Panthers picks, be sure to see what the SportsLine projection model has to say. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets instantly if your bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

Carolina has covered in five of six games versus NFC opponents in 2025, and its MNF opponent has major defensive holes. The Niners can neither get to the quarterback nor take the ball away as they rank dead last in defensive sacks and also have the second-fewest picks. That should bring comfort to Young in the pocket, while he also has the league's No. 4 rusher in Rico Dowdle to lean on. Finally, there doesn't appear to be much of a home-field advantage for the 49ers who have eight giveaways versus just one takeaway at Levi's Stadium this year. See which team to back at SportsLine.New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states:Why the 49ers can coverA finally healthy Brock Purdy showed what San Francisco is capable of last week as the Niners scored a season-high of 41 points after averaging just 22 on the season. The offense, however, runs through Christian McCaffrey, who leads the NFL in scrimmage yards and is on pace for 1,000-yard seasons both on the ground and through the air. George Kittle has also made an impact since coming off IR, with four scores over his last four games, and San won't see the most threatening of offenses come Monday. Carolina ranks 28th in scoring, with additional bottom-10 marks in passing offense, third down offense and yards per play. See which team to back at SportsLine. Check out the latest BetMGM promo code CBSSPORTS, where new users can get up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses.How to make 49ers vs. Panthers   picksFor Panthers vs. 49ers   on 'Monday Night Football,' the model is leaning Over the total, projecting 52 combined points.

    "body": "\n        Teams on the fringe of the NFC playoffs will wrap up Week 12 as the San Francisco 49ers host the Carolina Panthers on 'Monday Night Football'. San Fran's offense runs through Christian McCaffrey as daily Fantasy managers always have him top-of-mind when making NFL DFS picks. But the Niners also have the No. 2 passing offense, which makes Brock Purdy, Ricky Pearsall and George Kittle desirable for NFL DFS lineups, despite their injury-plagued seasons. As for Carolina, its top-10 rushing attack makes the backfield tandem of Rico Dowdle and Chuba Hubbard an intriguing MNF DFS stack.Any NFL daily strategy must include affordable options to balance out the big names with big price tags. Can Bryce Young, coming off a 448-yard, 3-TD game, be one of those options amongst the NFL DFS player pool? Before making any NFL DFS picks for Buccaneers vs. Rams, be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure. New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in bonus entries when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.McClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings.

This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings, including. In 2023, he finished tied for first in the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once.

You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:Top NFL DFS picks for Panthers vs. 49ersPart of McClure's NFL DFS strategy is rostering Niners tight end George Kittle. Since coming off IR in October, Kittle has looked every bit like the six-time Pro Bowler he is. He has four touchdowns over his last four games, also averaging 5.8 receptions and 56.5 yards over this span. He's been the TE2 in Fantasy during this stretch and has at least five catches in all three career games versus Carolina. This year's Panthers have struggled defending tight ends, as just six teams have allowed more receiving yards to tight ends than Carolina, while only seven teams have allowed more touchdowns to the position. See who else to roster at SportsLine.Another of McClure's NFL DFS picks is Panthers RB Rico Dowdle, who is averaging over 100 scrimmage yards with three total touchdowns over his last three games. He's clearly unseated Chuba Hubbard as Carolina's No. 1 RB, as the latter hasn't had more than five carries over this three-game stretch. Dowdle entered Week 12 ranking fourth in rushing yards (833) and eighth in scrimmage yards (1,030), and one shouldn't overlook the impact he could have out of the backfield. He tied a career high with five catches last week, going for 55 yards, and only one team has allowed more receptions to running backs this year than San Fran. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to set NFL DFS lineups for 'Monday Night Football'McClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Monday Night Football'.

Briles, who led Baylor from 2008-15, was suspended and subsequently fired after eight seasons following an independent investigation into Baylor's handling of sexual assault allegations during his tenure.Under Briles, Baylor went 65-37 with its first two Big 12 championships and New Year's Six/BCS bowl berths in program history. He also helped develop former first-round pick Robert Griffin III into a Heisman winner with record-setting numbers. Since his exit from Baylor, Briles has still been around the game, including coaching stints for Guelfi Firenze in the Italian Football League and at Mount Vernon (Texas) High School.Briles was announced as new offensive coordinator at Grambling State in February 2022, but resigned soon thereafter following widespread criticism. Five years earlier, the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League tried to hire Briles, but backlash led to them pulling the offer.At Baylor, Briles' ousting came after a review by Pepper Hamilton LLP found that he and his staff failed to properly handle Title IX issues on his team. Athletic director Ian McCaw and university president Ken Starr also resigned due to the scandal. \nAn NCAA infractions panel ruled in August 2021 that Briles was not guilty of any NCAA violations. However, the panel concluded that Briles \"failed to meet even the most basic expectations of how a person should react to the kind of conduct at issue in this case.\" A federal judge ruled in 2023 that Briles was not negligent in a case involving a female Baylor student, who said she was physically assaulted by a football player during his tenure. Briles received a $15.1 million settlement from Baylor and later apologized for what happened under his watch.\nIn 2023 while he was an assistant at Oklahoma, now-Mississippi State coach Jeff Lebby -- Briles' son-in-law -- apologized for allowing him on the field after a game. Oklahoma head coach Brent Venables and athletic director Joe Castiglione were not notified that Briles was on the field until after it happened.\n            \n    ",

    "description": "\n        After so much chatter this week about the offense's struggles, the Eagles came out on fire in Dallas on Sunday afternoon, scoring touchdowns ",
    "body": "\n        After so much chatter this week about the offense's struggles, the Eagles came out on fire in Dallas on Sunday afternoon, scoring touchdowns on their first three possessions. Jalen Hurts seemed like a man on a mission to alleviate the frustrations that were reportedly bubbling up in the Eagles' locker room about his performance, finding disgruntled wide receiver AJ Brown for the first touchdown of the game. It was a statement performance by Hurts and the Eagles for the first 20 minutes, but the wheels came off after that as the offense completely stalled out and watched the Cowboys slowly reel them in for a shocking 24-21 comeback win. The Eagles gained 116 yards and scored zero points on their final seven drives of the game, punting five times, missing a field goal and a losing a possession on a Saquon Barkley fumble. After the game, Hurts spoke about Philly's \"tale of two halves\" and called for the team to find some consistency, but expressed optimism that the team will figure things out. \"We've got to find a way to finish the game, and we've got to find some consistency in what we do,\" Hurts said. \"Definitely the tale of two halves. In the end, we didn't play a complete game as a team, and today it got us. Give a lot of respect to Dallas and their team, how they competed. Something you question right now is just how we respond to it, and I have a lot of confidence in how we'll respond. ... It's an opportunity for us to come together, eliminate the things that don't matter and focus on the things that we can control and go out there and play together and build forward.\" \nOne of the biggest issues for the Eagles in finishing games this season has been their struggles running the football. After dominating on the ground a year ago, Philadelphia has become a mediocre rushing attack, which has taken away their superpower of grinding defenses down late in games. Barkley has rushed for over 100 yards in a game just once this season after doing so 11 times in 2024. After hitting a new low with 10 carries for 22 yards and a fumble against Dallas, Barkley shouldered the responsibility for the run game's struggles and insisted he would break out of the \"funk\" he's in right now.\n        \n            \n                Cowboys' George Pickens 'not from this planet'; powers Dallas to win over Eagles with another 140-yard effort\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"I'm more disappointed with myself, not frustrated with anybody else. I'm a big believer the run game starts with me and ends with me,\" Barkley said, via ESPN. \"I'm in a little funk right now, I've had funks like this before, just got to break it. I'm not getting the run game going. I'm not getting yards. I'm tired of the excuse of people trying to stop the run game. I don't really subscribe to that. Just got to be better, got to make plays.\"\nOne of the big arguments about the Eagles this season is the chicken vs. egg debate about whether it's the run game's fault the passing game is struggling or if it's the lack of a passing attack that's causing the run game to be ineffective. Barkley, at least publicly, is taking the blame for the Eagles' issues on the ground and isn't interested in other explanations. It's hard to imagine worse vibes around an 8-3 team that still controls its destiny in the division and is just one game out of the top seed in the NFC. However, Philly had been playing with fire for weeks with an inept offense leaning on a dominant defense to carry them to wins, and on Sunday we saw how that can go wrong quickly. The Eagles' defense picked up a few injuries in the back end and was suddenly susceptible to the dangerous Dallas passing attack, getting carved up by Dak Prescott and George Pickens in the second half. Perhaps Sunday's loss can be a wake up call for Philly after dancing through rain drops in recent weeks. That's at least the hope for Hurts, who called on the team to come together and let the embarrassment of Sunday's loss light a fire for them late in the regular season. \n\"We've got to own this one, let it light a fire in us as a team and stay together and move forward,\" Hurts said. \n            ",

It's the fifth time they've blown a fourth quarter lead this season -- and fourth blown lead of 10 points or more -- and their continued inability to close out games defensively has cost defensive coordinator Shane Bowen his job, sources told CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones. New York will name outside linebackers coach Charlie Bullen as interim defensive coordinator, according to NFL Media. Given the strength of New York's team this year was supposed to be their pass rush, led by high-priced stars Brian Burns and Dexter Lawrence, as well as No. 3 overall pick Abdul Carter, their struggles late in games when teams have been in must-pass situations has been jarring. Overall, Bowen's defense has given up the third-most points and third-most yards in the NFL this season, and the Giants decided to make another coaching staff change under interim coach Mike Kafka. \nSunday's loss to Detroit happened suddenly, with Jahmyr Gibbs breaking off a 69-yard touchdown run on the first play of overtime, which the Giants' offense could not match on their final possession of the game. Gibbs went for 219 yards and two touchdowns on 15 carries.Bowen will now join former Giants coach Brian Daboll on the job market. The Giants, meanwhile, will try to close the season strong and build some positive momentum over the next five games, but will be wondering what could have been this season had they been able to convert late leads into wins. \nWhile those losses don't land solely on the defense, with the offense bearing some responsibility for not being able to control clock well enough or completely putting teams away, the lack of stops in key moments stands out and Sunday's effort against Detroit served as the final straw in New York. \n            \n    ",

Campbell is a candidate for injured reserve, and the Patriots could remove him from the active roster with the hope that he returns for the stretch run or postseason.Campbell went down with the injury in the third quarter, and the Patriots officially ruled the No. 4 overall pick out in the fourth quarter. After another player landed on Campbell's leg, he entered the medical tent and later departed for the locker room on a cart. He put a towel over his head as he exited the field.\"We won't know much,\" Patriots coach Mike Vrabel said on Monday. \"Yesterday was not a great day for us with injuries. There will be some players that went out of that game yesterday that won't be available on Monday night. Hopefully we get some of those guys back. We have an extra day. I won't be able to tell you much. \"I wouldn't imagine that Will is going play in the game. I don't think that will be something that will happen. That injury is going to probably be more than a week or two.\"\nCampbell played 695 offensive snaps, or 98.3% of the Patriots' offensive plays, this year before going down with the injury.The Patriots were already down an offensive lineman when Campbell left the game. Left guard Jared Wilson departed from the contest in the first quarter with an ankle injury. According to ESPN Research, Wilson and Campbell were only the second rookie duo to open a season as starters at left guard and left tackle since 2000. Veteran tackle Vederian Lowe and veteran guard Ben Brown came in to replace the injured linemen.\nTthe Patriots have remained relatively healthy this year and started the same offensive line for 10 of their 11 games. Quarterback Drake Maye, who is in the MVP conversation, has benefited from the offensive line's consistency.\n            \n    ",

He has 27 catches for 251 yards and five touchdowns in six games this season and has scored in four of the five games where he's been targeted at least four times. The Carolina defense has generally been solid this season, but tight ends do have 58 catches for 718 yards and five touchdowns against the Panthers.

However, Kyle Shanahan has been making a concerted effort to get Robinson involved, particularly in short-yardage situations. He's had eight carries in each of his last two games and has scored a touchdown in two of San Francisco's last three outings.

He's healthy now, but Dowdle has become the workhorse in Carolina. However, Hubbard was a big-money signing not that long ago and as the more physically imposing back between the two, it wouldn't be out of the question for him to receive some goal-line usage.

    "body": "\n        The San Francisco 49ers host the Carolina Panthers In the Week 12 edition of \"Monday Night Football'' with San Francisco coming off a blowout victory over the division rival Arizona Cardinals, having improved to 7-4 with the win. The Niners have alternated wins and losses every week since starting 3-0, and they'll be looking to break that streak and keep pace in the division race with a victory over Carolina here.Carolina secured an overtime win over the division rival Atlanta Falcons last week to improve to 6-5. After the Tampa Bay Buccaneers lost on Sunday night, the Panthers now have a chance to take over sole possession of first place in the NFC South, which they can capture with a win on Monday.Which of these two teams will make it back-to-back victories? We'll find out soon enough. But before we break down the matchup, here's a look at how you can watch the game.Where to watch 49ers vs. Panthers liveDate: Monday, Nov. 14 | Time: 8:15 p.m. ETLocation: Levi's Stadium (Santa Clara, California)TV: ESPN/ABC | Stream: Fubo (Try for free) Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: 49ers -7.5, O/U 49.5 via DraftKings SportsbookWhen the Panthers have the ballCarolina is coming off an unusual offensive game wherein it did not run the ball particularly well but absolutely exploded in the passing game. The Panthers ran for just 67 yards last week against the Falcons, but Bryce Young went an incredible 31 of 45 for 448 yards and three touchdowns. \nThe 49ers, meanwhile, played a very similar game against the Arizona offense to the one Carolina played against Atlanta's defense: San Francisco held the Cardinals to just 36 yards rushing (on 14 carries) but allowed 452 passing yards as Jacoby Brissett set the NFL record for completions in a game. So, the question here is whether we are treated to a repeat performance on either end of the field. It's worth noting that the Falcons game alone accounts for 22.8% of Young's passing yards for the season -- and he's played in 10 of the team's 11 games. The Panthers want the run game to be the center of their attack, and they're probably not going to go overly pass-heavy unless they're forced into it. The San Francisco defense is banged up all over the place, with Nick Bosa, Fred Warner, Mykel Williams and Yetur Gross-Matos all on injured reserve and even guys like Tatum Bethune and Robert Beal Jr. either doubtful (Beal) or out (Bethune). Even Luke Gifford, who could be asked to fill in for Bethune at linebacker, is listed as questionable. And they'll be counting on guys like Keion White, Sam Okuayinonu and Clelin Ferrell on the edge alongside Bryce Huff.\nThe Niners have been slightly better against the run (22nd in success rate) than they have been against the pass (26th), but they haven't been particularly good against either. Obviously, a lot of that is owed to their various injuries; but those guys won't be back for this game. The Panthers should be able to find some success running the ball downhill with Rico Dowdle, and take the pressure off Young to carry the offense. If and when Young does drop back, it would be surprising if Deommodore Lenoir follows Tetairoa McMillan around the field. Lenoir has lined up at left cornerback on all 624 snaps that he's played on the perimeter, according to Pro Football Focus, so the Panthers can generate a better matchup by having T-Mac line up across from Renardo Green if they want. Green's no slouch, but Lenoir is the team's best corner. Young's other weapons aren't much to write home about.When the 49ers have the ballBrock Purdy returned last week for San Francisco and immediately showed why there was never any controversy about who was going to be the team's starting quarterback, despite Mac Jones having had some success when under center in his place. \nPurdy went 19 of 26 for 200 yards and three touchdowns, beautifully layering the ball all over the field and spreading it around to the likes of Christian McCaffrey, George Kittle and Jauan Jennings. McCaffrey even had one of his more successful games of the season on the ground, rushing 13 times for 81 yards and two touchdowns, and you could see how much more open space he had to run with a greater threat of the downfield passing attack available to San Francisco.The Niners are still going to build the plane around a lot of touches for CMC, who is averaging 24.3 rushes plus receptions per game so far this year. There will be a ton of pressure on Carolina's linebackers and safeties to deal with him in space, and honestly, there just aren't many players at those positions who are equipped to do so -- especially when the players at those same positions also have to worry about getting beaten by Kittle over the middle or up the seam. It doesn't help that Carolina will be without both Trevin Wallace and Christian Rozeboom, robbing the Panthers of both of their starting inside linebackers. Guys like Claudin Cherelus, Maema Njongmeta and possibly Bam Martin-Scott will have to play bigger roles, while there will be even more pressure on the likes of Trevon Moehrig Nick Scott and potential slot corner Corey Thornton to deal with those two demons as well.\nIt'll be interesting to see if the Panthers use Jaycee Horn to shadow a receiver, and if so, whether it's Jennings or Ricky Pearsall, who looked like the top perimeter option earlier in the year before getting injured and missing extended time. The Niners don't have a true No. 1 wideout, so there's not necessarily an obvious man to Horn to follow. If he does travel, I'd bet on it being with Jennings, who aligns on the line of scrimmage more often than does Pearsall, who goes into motion more often.The Panthers' best bet here is to plug up the run game and turn the 49ers into a one-dimensional passing offense and then generate considerably pressure on Purdy. That's easier said than done, obviously, and even if you can do it, you still have to worry about all the various weapons the Niners can throw at you through the air. Prediction\nThe Niners looked great in Brock Purdy's return to the field last week, and that was against a better defense than the one they'll face on Monday night. I know the Panthers finally figured out a way to throw the ball all over the yard themselves last week, but that's still an aberration when it comes to their season-long performance. If San Francisco can hold Rico Dowdle in check, I think the Niners should roll.\nPrediction: 49ers 27, Panthers 16\n            ",

Mayfield did not play the rest of the game and spent the second half in a sling as Tampa Bay lost its third straight.Buccaneers coach Todd Bowles said Mayfield will be re-evaluated on Monday and MRI results should reveal the extend of the injury. The Buccaneers (6-5) started the season 6-2 overall, but this rough patch in recent weeks squandered their lead in the NFC South.Now tied with the Carolina Panthers at the top of the division, the Buccaneers are the No. 4 seed in the NFC with six games to play. Tampa Bay is gunning for its sixth straight divisional crown, but Mayfield's availability is paramount to reaching the postseason.Mayfield threw a touchdown pass and two interceptions in the first half of Sunday's loss in Los Angeles before exiting the game. He was the league's leading MVP candidate through the first six games before the schedule stiffened.The Buccaneers host the Arizona Cardinals, New Orleans Saints and Atlanta Falcons over the next three weeks as they turn to Teddy Bridgewater if Mayfield is sidelined. Mayfield experienced pain in his non-throwing shoulder before in his career after tearing his labrum during the 2021 season.\nA shoulder sprain usually takes a few weeks to heal, but quarterbacks have returned in short order with rest as well.\"You never want to see guys injured, especially your leader,\" Bridgewater said. \"But Baker's a tough guy, man. He tried to come back out there and tough it out for the guys. That says a lot about him.\"Now in his third seasons with the Buccaneers, Mayfield made 45 consecutive starts and has not missed a game since 2022 when a high ankle sprain with the Panthers caused him to miss time. \nMayfield has thrown for 2,406 yards and 18 touchdowns this season with a 60.8 QBR, the second-highest rating of his career.\n            \n    ",

The CBS Sports 136 has evaluated every FBS team since the preseason in August, and with 11 and 12 data points now logged, the tiers are largely entrenched.That doesn't mean teams can't climb with an impressive result -- or give up ground with a stunning loss. Week 13 offered examples of both near the top of the rankings, with even more dramatic swings outside the top 25.Oklahoma, Miami and Michigan all moved up after beating conference foes on Saturday. The Sooners jumped ahead of Alabama to No. 9, while Miami climbed four spots after a 17-point win at Virginia Tech — the biggest jump of any team inside the top 20. Michigan, Virginia and Tennessee also rose multiple spots.Georgia Tech, meanwhile, surrendered much of the ground it gained during its 8-0 start, falling seven spots to No. 22 after its second loss in three games. The Yellow Jackets' tumble after losing to Pittsburgh was far more dramatic than the slight dips for USC and Missouri (both down four) after the Trojans and Tigers lost as road underdogs to highly ranked opponents.\nWhile the top of the rankings has mostly settled into distinct tiers, with only minor shuffling from week to week, the same can't be said for the middle of the CBS Sports 136. Some of the most notable moves in this week's update came between Nos. 25 and 60, where teams with multiple losses and layered résumés are battling for position in the top half of the FBS-wide rankings.For more on those changes -- and other adjustments after Week 13 -- check out the Movers Report below the top-25 table.College football experts from CBS Sports and 247Sports contribute ballots each week, which are averaged together for our rankings. You can see the top 25 below and 26-136 on our rankings page.\nRankTeamRecordPrevious1Ohio State11-012Indiana11-023Texas A&M11-034Georgia10-145Texas Tech10-156Oregon10-167Ole Miss10-178Notre Dame9-289Oklahoma9-21010Alabama9-2911BYU10-11112Miami9-21613Utah9-21214Vanderbilt9-21315Michigan9-21716Virginia9-21917Texas8-31818USC8-31419Tennessee8-32220North Texas10-12021James Madison10-12122Georgia Tech9-21523Pittsburgh8-32424Tulane9-22625SMU8-332Biggest movers No. 47 Boise State (+10): The Broncos had taken a pretty dramatic drop in the rankings after back-to-back losses to Fresno State and San Diego State that saw just seven points scored in each defeat. Well the offense finally found its footing again against Colorado State and the 49-21 win earned back some of those spots lost in recent weeks. Boise State is 7-4 but has quality conference wins wins against UNLV and New Mexico that help gain some advantages when voters are splitting ties in this range of the rankings. No. 28 Arizona State (+8): Losing Sam Leavitt has not proven to be a season-ending development for Arizona State. The Sun Devils have won three straight games and remain mathematically alive for the Big 12 title. Journeyman quarterback Jeff Sims helped guide the offense to a 42-point showing against Colorado, which which now has the Sun Devils 8-3 on the year with a chance to finish strong against rival Arizona on Friday night. No. 25 SMU (+7): A key Week 13 win over Louisville and some help elsewhere has positioned SMU to reach the ACC Championship Game for a second straight season. The Mustangs only ACC loss was a one-point defeat to Wake Forest, and the SMU team that thrashed the Cardinals looked far more in sync than the one that 2-2 with a pair of nonconference losses in September.  No. 22 Georgia Tech (-7): The Yellow Jackets' back-breaking loss to Pitt bas damaged their conference title hopes more than their CBS Sports 136 status. Georgia Tech, now at 8-3, fell close to Pitt's position in the rankings while the Panthers did not move much, indicating that our voters were more disappointed in the Yellow Jackets performance than enthused by the win on the other side. With a regular season finale against Georgia there is clearly an opportunity to reverse this movement in the rankings, but the ACC title contention aspect of the season might be done unless Brent Key's group gets a lot of help on Saturday. No. 30 Houston (-7): Tracking Houston's ranking in the CBS Sports 136 looks more like an EKG meter. The Cougars bounced up after being Arizona State to improve to 7-1, down after an upset home loss to West Virginia, back up five spots after steadying the ship against UCF and now all of that was given back with a seven-spot drop in the wake of losing 17-14 to TCU. The Coogs have operated with narrow margins for most of the season so these recent defeats make it tough to argue for inclusion in the top 25. No. 42 Nebraska (-8): The absence of Dylan Raiola will add an asterisk to these late-season results for Nebraska, but getting beat soundly by an interim-coach led Penn State is going to change some opinions on where this team should be on a ballot. The early season successes still matter, but the team that's on the field right now is closer a top-50 team than a top-25 team. No. 60 California (-10): A familiar trend in the 2025 season has been that one of the biggest fallers in the CBS Sports 136 often becomes a team that fires its head coach on Sunday. California now joins that group, moving on from Justin Wilcox after a 31-10 loss to rival Stanford. The Bears are bowl eligible at 6-5 but have dropped three of their last four and clearly didn't bring any momentum from their road upset of Louisville back to the West Coast.No. 38 Illinois (-13): The Fighting Illini had taken care of business against lesser competition and only fallen short against the top tier of the Big Ten. That was not the case on Saturday. Illinois lost at Wisconsin in a disappointing showing for a group that has been better for much of the year. The loss dropped Illinois to 7-4 on the year, and instead of knocking on the door step of the top 25 it's a group that will be clinging to its spot inside the top 40. Check out the rest of the CBS Sports 136: Teams ranked 26-136\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        The Oklahoma City Thunder played their 18th game of the season on Sunday. Star forward Jalen Williams, recovering from offseason wrist surgery, has not participated in any of them. It's a frustrating turn of events in a recovery saga that's taken longer than anyone expected, but it will hopefully be a harmless one. Well, at least physically. While Williams is expected to make a full recovery, this unanticipated absence could cost him as much as $47 million.How? To answer that, we need to dive into the minutia of the NBA's Collective Bargaining Agreement. Williams just completed his third NBA season. As a former first-round pick, that meant he was eligible to sign a contract extension last offseason. Players with six or fewer years of experience are eligible to sign contracts that start at 25% of the salary cap. Sounds simple enough, right? Williams extended last offseason on a five-year deal that guarantees him a projected $240 million.However, especially productive young players can earn more through the Derrick Rose Rule. If the player in question has made an All-NBA Team or won Defensive Player of the Year either in the season before his new contract kicks in or in two of the previous three seasons, he is eligible to earn up to 30% of the cap. If a player has won MVP in any of the three previous seasons, he is also eligible. When a player isn't yet eligible for such a raise, but could potentially become eligible on future performance, that player can sign a contract that includes performance-based escalators. Evan Mobley did just that after his third season and, when he won Defensive Player of the Year in his fourth, his contract came with that bump.Williams signed a somewhat similar contract last offseason, though the terms, according to Zach Lowe, were a bit more team-friendly. Had Williams made Third-Team All-NBA this season, he would have been bumped from 25% of the cap up to 26%. A Second-Team selection would've knocked him up to 27%, and if he'd been a First-Team choice or won one of those two major awards, he would've gotten the full 30%. At that full 30%, his projected contract would have paid him around $287 million, a $47 million increase on the base amount guaranteed by his contract. However, Williams will get none of these bumps.\nWhy? Because he's now missed 18 games. When a player has missed 18 games in an 82-game season, the most he can play in that season would be 64 games. A few years ago, the NBA instituted a 65-game minimum for major individual honors. Assuming Williams does not play on Wednesday, he will not be eligible for MVP, Defensive Player of the Year or All-NBA. Those contractual escalators are now gone.Now, Williams will still earn a ton of money. You can live pretty well in Oklahoma on $240 million. And his escalators weren't all-or-nothing. Many players sign rookie extensions that take them up to 30% with any All-NBA selection. But still, Williams has lost the chance to earn millions of dollars through this injury.So why does any of this matter? Because the rule costing Williams this money is fundamentally broken. Williams can't make All-NBA this season, but he shouldn't have to. He made it last season.\nThe specific language of the rule, as we covered, allows for the bump if the player hit one of those benchmarks in the season before the deal kicked in or two of the previous three seasons. Williams has already proven he is an All NBA-caliber player. He just did it a year too early. If he'd spent the beginning of last season recovering from this injury but was healthy this season, he'd cash in on that bump to 26%. The order is all that matters here. He was an All-NBA player when he signed the contract, but won't be when it begins.So why does this rule exist? The likeliest answer is that it's an extension of the Designated Veteran rule, better known as the \"supermax\" rule. This allows players with between seven and nine years of experience to jump from 30% of the cap to 35% of the cap. For those older players, demanding that a player has made All-NBA in the previous season makes some sense because those players are more vulnerable to age-related decline.But players signing rookie extensions, like Williams, should be expected to continue improving, not plateau or decline. The idea in their case should be forcing them to prove that they are capable of reaching that level, not that they'll be there every year. After all, for a rookie to assure himself Rose Rule eligibility upon signing his contract, he would have to make All-NBA in both his second and third season, or 67% of his career to that point. The only player to do that since the rule was conceived is Luka Dončić. Every other Rose Rule beneficiary, aside from Rose himself who inspired it, got there thanks to their performance in their fourth season.\nPart of you might be tempted to suggest that since those players earned the extra money in their fourth year, Williams should have to as well, but many of them didn't already have a third-year All-NBA selection as he did. If anything, what Williams did is more impressive. He reached that milestone early but can't benefit from it.Aside from being unfair to Williams, this turn of events is rather unfortunate for the rest of the league. It's obviously a good problem to have, but the Thunder are about to get pretty expensive. Williams and Chet Holmgren will both start max rookie extensions next year. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander will start a supermax deal a year after that. The rest of the league would prefer it if that core was as expensive as humanly possible so that Sam Presti would have to make harder choices with the rest of his roster. Williams loses, but so do the 29 other teams trying to catch up to the Thunder.What's especially maddening about this is that it's a one-shot deal. Williams can't earn that money back with subsequent All-NBA performances. He had one chance and he missed it. This is exactly what happened to Jayson Tatum. He made Third-Team All-NBA in his third season, missed All-NBA in his fourth, and then proceeded to make four straight First Teams after that. Tatum was obviously worthy of the contract bump when he signed it. He proved he was worthy of it as the contract progressed. He didn't get it because he happened to have a down year in the one season that mattered. The Celtics benefitted tremendously from that unlucky sequence of events. The Thunder likely will too. But it shows just how broken this rule is.\nWe're unfortunately a few years away from the end of the current CBA, which includes an opt-out after the 2028-29 season, so no immediate changes are coming. When the CBA is revisited, though, this is a rule that really should be reconsidered. While players like Williams and Tatum should've gained eligibility as soon as they made their First All-NBA Team, there are compromises in here that could make sense.The easiest would be to change the timing of eligibility. Putting this much weight on any single season, especially for such young players, makes no sense. These rookie contracts, more than any other in the NBA, are designed to pay for future performance, and potential can be showcased in more seasons than just the most recent. Maybe a player who missed out on eligibility before the contract kicked in could earn eligibility in subsequent seasons by making an All-NBA Team later on. Maybe the boosts could be designed to stack on top of each other, granting bigger and bigger annual raises with each All-NBA selection earned during the life of the contract.Something should be done about this in the future, because the entire point of these bigger max contracts is to reward the very best players in the sport. Jalen Williams qualifies. Apparently, he just did so too early to get rewarded for it.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        ARLINGTON, Texas -- It was one thing for new Dallas Cowboys wide receiver George Pickens to go off for 144 yards and a touchdown on nine catches in the team's Week 11 \"Monday Night Football\" victory over the Las Vegas Raiders.It's another for Pickens to top that effort with 146 yards receiving and a touchdown with catches on all ninw of his targets to help power the Cowboys back from a franchise-record 21-0 hole to upset the defending Super Bowl LIX champion Philadelphia Eagles 24-21 like he did in Week 12. Of his total yards receiving, 133 came after the Eagles took the 21-0 early in the second quarter. \"Well, I'll tell you George has been such an integral part of our story. He has his story to a degree, and that's our story. I'm so proud for him,\" Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones said. \"Everybody on this team is, and he certainly has absolutely been the difference as we've played over the last two weeks. … It's something when you've got 88 [CeeDee Lamb] and Pickens.\"He is now up to 1,054 yards receiving (the second-most in the NFL), eight receiving touchdowns (the third-most in the NFL) on a career-high 67 catches (the eighth-most in the NFL). Pickens' 15.7 yards per catch rank as the fifth-most in the league, and his eight receiving touchdowns are tied for the second-most by a Cowboys player in his first 11 games with the franchise.\n\"Really just grinding. I just kind of always [knew] what I was capable of,\" Pickens said. \"I used to have 100-yard games in college all the time. Just definitely, as a team, keep going because I've seen the downs of it as well. Just keep going and get as many wins as we can.\"Not a bad value for the Cowboys with all they had to give up to get the 24-year-old in a trade with the Pittsburgh Steelers this past offseason being a 2026 third-round pick and a 2027 fifth-round pick.\"We are proud we've got him. I don't know if anyone has helped his team any more to win this year,\" Jones said. \"So the good times we've had, Pickens has had his hand in for the most part. … Of course, we are proud to have him, and I don't even want to play games with[out] him. We'd love to have him on the team. By the way, I'd love to have 88 on the team. I know what we're asking around here, but we like the way the combination is letting us execute on offense.\"\nQuarterback Dak Prescott knew he was getting another No. 1-caliber wide receiver this season, but now the 10-year vet, who is now Dallas' all-time passing yards leader, views the peak for Pickens as \"limitless.\"\"It's hard for me to say [he] exceeds my expectations. My expectations for him are limitless, and he'll tell you that he's not from here,\" Prescott said. ... \"He's not from here, he's not from this planet and so, I'm not going to put limitations on him. He went out there and did what he's done in games when he has that opportunity,  in practice as well. The guy loves the game. He stays focused. Just the communication, as I've said before, to other guys  in the huddle about staying focused and keep doing what you're doing. We lucked out with getting a guy like that. We have to make sure that we can keep him here. He's a hell of a player turning into a leader, and he's special.\"\nThe electricity he provides for Dallas was especially apparent in the fourth quarter on Sunday. With Dallas trailing 21-14 and driving to try to tie the game, Prescott heaved a play-action deep shot from his own 46 up to Pickens despite two Eagles cornerbacks, Cooper DeJean and Sydney Brown draped around. Pickens made the catch to push Dallas all the way down to the 11. Two plays later, the game was tied at 21 with the Cowboys scoring on an 8-yard scramble from Prescott with 11:48 left to play. \n\"Definitely the energy,\" Pickens said of what he feels after his explosive catches. \"I'm an energy guy myself, so that's why you probably always see me do the crazy celebrations, get really hyped, because I know it's a big turning point. And I know defenses, when you've got the momentum or you make a splash play, that demoralizes them.\"  \nEarlier this week, Lamb made it clear how much he and Dallas' teammates have gone out of their way to embrace Pickens, and he's feeling the love. That's perhaps one of the driving forces behind Pickens' All-Pro-caliber season in Year 1 as a Cowboy. \"The guys I'm doing it with honestly. I feel like the guys I'm doing with it are some amazing guys: Dak, CeeDee [wide receiver Ryan] Flo [Flournoy],\" Pickens said. \"Even some guys on defense. Just the guys I'm doing it with.\"\nPickens' Dallas futureJones was asked about Pickens' future as he finishes the last year of his rookie deal in 2025, and he signaled the Cowboys front office would continue to let things play out. That may come back to bite them come negotiation time in the spring because Pickens' production has him angling to be one of the highest-paid wide receivers in football. \"We can let it come as well. It's something when you've got [Lamb] and Pickens,\" Jones said. ... \"I don't just try to spend my day messing with agents as you well know. I'm proud he's having the season he is having. It exceeds anything we could have hoped for.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Now, it makes sense. The reason why first, second, and third base are largely devoid of prospects is because they're all hiding out at shortstop. It's where the most talented players start out, and at least in recent years, teams have been reluctant to move them off it, not wanting to concede anything developmentally until the last possible moment. And so we see this imbalance. While sorting prospects by position makes sense in theory, it leads to my top seven here also being my top seven overall. I'm not even joking. 2026 Prospects: C | 1B | 2B | 3B | SS | OF | P  To account for this, I've gone 25 deep here as compared to 10 deep at  all the other infield positions. I'm still not convinced it's enough.  Some shortstop prospects who will appear in virtually every top 100  list, including maybe my own, had to be left out. Maybe I'll go 30 deep  here next year, who knows?   Note: These rankings are intended mainly for Dynasty use, emphasizing long-term value over a quick payoff, but to say proximity holds no weight wouldn't be entirely accurate either. Not all of these players will contribute in 2026 — most, in fact, will not — but among prospects, they're the names Fantasy Baseballers most need to know.         \n      1. Konnor Griffin, Pirates Age (on opening day): 19         Where he played in 2025: Low-A, High-A, Double-A         Minor league stats: .333 BA (484 AB), 21 HR, 65 SB, .941 OPS, 50 BB, 122 K Tall and muscular, Griffin is the sort of prospect who you could easily picture in a facemask and shoulder pads, like he's too athletic for the sport he chose, which obviously speaks well of his upside. That he was refined enough to deliver on that upside across three levels as a 19-year-old caught the entire baseball world by surprise. I don't make Mike Trout comparisons lightly -- and Griffin isn't a disciplined enough hitter for it to be an apples-to-apples one -- but the way he outclasses everyone on the field with him is reminiscent of Trout.  2. Kevin McGonigle, Tigers Age (on opening day): 21         Where he played in 2025: Low-A, High-A, Double-A         Minor league stats: .305 BA (331 AB), 19 HR, 10 SB, .991 OPS, 59 BB, 46 K \nWhether Griffin or McGonigle belongs at No. 1 is the latest installment in the age-old debate of ability vs. skill, and while I usually come down on the skill side of the ledger, the ability gap is the bigger one in this case. McGonigle is great, though, collecting more walks than strikeouts at every minor league stop while sporting a swing that's already optimized for power. He might deliver multiple seasons like the one Geraldo Perdomo had in 2025.  3. Jesus Made, Brewers Age (on opening day): 18         Where he played in 2025: Low-A, High-A, Double-A         Minor league stats: .285 BA (453 AB), 6 HR, 47 SB, .792 OPS, 67 BB, 108 K Made already delivers exit velocities better than the average major leaguer, and he's still months away from turning 19. Along with his advanced plate discipline and tenacity for stealing bases, you can see why so many are bullish on his future, even as he works to improve the angle that the ball takes off his bat. While shortstop remains in play, third base may be his ultimate destination, and you could dream on a Jose Ramirez outcome there. \n 4. JJ Wetherholt, Cardinals Age (on opening day): 23         Where he played in 2025: Double-A, Triple-A         Minor league stats: .306 BA (408 AB), 17 HR, 23 SB, .931 OPS, 72 BB, 73 K The line between McGonigle and Wetherholt is thinner than the press releases would have you believe, with contact hitting being the standout skill for both. Wetherholt's swing is geared more for line drives at present, undercutting his power potential, but he's already mastered Triple-A and seemed poised to step in at either second or third base in September. It didn't happen then, but it probably will this spring.       5. Leo De Vries, Athletics Age (on opening day): 19           Where he played in 2025: High-A, Double-A           Minor league stats: .255 BA (455 AB), 15 HR, 11 SB, .806 OPS, 66 BB, 107 K \nYou could take the Padres' willingness to part with De Vries in the Mason Miller deal as a warning that he's not all his hurried promotions made him out to be (Ethan Salas, anyone?). But the Athletics took it a step further in August, bumping him up to Double-A as an 18-year-old, and saw him slash .281/.359/.551 in 21 games there. So perhaps he really is that special, in which case there's no limit, really, to how productive he could be.  6. Colt Emerson, Mariners Age (on opening day): 20         Where he played in 2025: High-A, Double-A, Triple-A           Minor league stats: .285 BA (506 AB), 16 HR, 14 SB, .842 OPS, 71 BB, 105 K Investing in Emerson at cost over the past couple years has required some measure of faith since, for as evident as his hit tool and plate discipline were, his power was almost entirely theoretical. That changed in 2025, when a quieter setup and two-handed finish led to a .311/.404/.510 slash line over his final 76 games, along with a sharp reduction in ground ball rate. Already, there's talk of him making the Mariners' opening day roster, and a Corey Seager-like outcome remains on the table. \n 7. Sebastian Walcott, Rangers Age (on opening day): 20           Where he played in 2025: Double-A           Minor league stats: .255 BA (474 AB), 13 HR, 32 SB, .741 OPS, 70 BB, 108 K Sorting out Nos. 3-7 at this position is a hair-splitting exercise, and some will place Walcott first among them because his power projection surpasses the others. But his hit tool also represents the clearest liability for any of them. Striking out less than 20 percent of the time at Double-A, particularly at his age, is a good sign, but he also slugged just .386 there. Believe the upside, but recognize that he's still a work in progress.       8. Aidan Miller, Phillies Age (on opening day): 21         Where he played in 2025: Double-A, Triple-A         Minor league stats: .264 BA (432 AB), 14 HR, 59 SB, .825 OPS, 82 BB, 123 K \nMiller's prospect stock was on life support around midseason, looking like a casualty of the improved breaking balls that came with his move up to Double-A. But everything clicked into place in late July, seeing him slash .357/.489/.601 over his final 38 games, which included a move up to Triple-A. With that, his stock is as high as it's ever been, featuring a broad skill set that would easily position him as the Phillies' shortstop of the near future if not for Trea Turner.  9. Eli Willits, Nationals Age (on opening day): 18         Where he played in 2025: Low-A         Minor league stats: .300 BA (50 AB), 1 3B, 1 2B, 2 SB, 7 BB, 12 K The first pick of the 2025 draft stands out most for his polish, as evidenced by him holding his own for 15 games as a 17-year-old in a full-season league -- a genuinely remarkable achievement. That polish makes it easy to imagine Willits developing more power than he has at present, and the other tools already earn high marks. The dream scenario is something like Trea Turner (two mentions in a row!), and the floor is abnormally high for a player his age. \n      10. Bryce Rainer, Tigers Age (on opening day): 20         Where he played in 2025: Low-A         Minor league stats: .288 BA (125 AB), 5 HR, 9 SB, .831 OPS, 20 BB, 33 K The difficulty in assessing Rainer now, more than a year after he was selected 11th overall, is that he's appeared in only 35 games as a professional, having been limited in 2025 by a dislocated shoulder. But those 35 games showed him to be exactly the player we thought -- one who combines premium exit velocities with a keen batting eye for a true middle-of-the-order projection. His size (6-feet-3), hitting profile, and left-handedness all make for a plausible Gunnar Henderson comp (in a best-case scenario, of course).       11. Luis Pena, Brewers Age (on opening day): 19         Where he played in 2025: Low-A, High-A         Minor league stats: .270 BA (374 AB), 9 HR, 44 SB, .757 OPS, 34 BB, 68 K \nA hot start and a big jump in exit velocity took Pena from being an also-ran in the Brewers system to a prospect rivaling Jesus Made. The power is still fledgling because he's content to let the ball travel deep into the zone rather than getting the bat head out in front, and his .168 batting average in 25 games at High-A shows he has other hurdles to clear as well. He's likely ticketed for second base, where he'd profile similarly to the 2025 version of Brice Turang, standing out most for his speed but with a bat that still plays.  12. Ethan Holliday, Rockies Age (on opening day): 19         Where he played in 2025: Low-A         Minor league stats: .239 BA (71 AB), 2 HR, 4 2B, .737 OPS, 12 BB, 33 K Considering his baseball bloodlines (with father Matt and brother Jackson both being well known) and high draft status (fourth overall pick in 2025), Holliday is a surprisingly polarizing prospect. Advocates point to his chiseled frame and easy power. Detractors think he'll struggle against modern fastballs up in the zone because of his high setup and uppercut swing. While the detractors won the first round (his first 18 professional games saw him strike out 39 percent of the time), most every 18-year-old is in need of swing adjustments. Give it time. \n 13. JoJo Parker, Blue Jays Age (on opening day): 19         Where he played in 2025: did not play -- draft year The eighth pick in the 2025 draft has yet to make his professional debut, which leaves me completely at the mercy of the scouting reports, but they have nothing but positive things to say about Parker's bat. He's already adept at elevating the ball and is particularly effective against fastballs, which points to him being a plus for both batting average and home runs.  14. Aiva Arquette, Marlins Age (on opening day): 22         Where he played in 2025: High-A         Minor league stats: .242 BA (99 AB), 1 HR, 7 SB, .674 OPS, 17 BB, 27 K Arquette stands 6-feet-5, which comes with the usual pros and cons -- i.e., a swing that's leveraged for power but a strike zone that has some holes. He was widely considered the top collegiate bat in the 2025 draft, though, and is disciplined enough to keep the batting average from being too much of a liability. You shouldn't be surprised if he winds up at third base long-term, where his power will absolutely play.  15. Kaelen Culpepper, Twins Age (on opening day): 23           Where he played in 2025: High-A, Double-A           Minor league stats: .289 BA (454 AB), 20 HR, 25 SB, .844 OPS, 50 BB, 90 K Power was thought to be the trait holding Culpepper back when the Twins made him the 21st pick in the 2024 draft, so him socking 20 homers in just 113 games -- with a near even distribution between High-A and Double-A, no less -- should paint him in a more favorable light. He continued to make contact at a high rate and has proven to be a capable base-stealer as well, so I would encourage people not to cling to their priors when assessing him for 2026 and beyond.  16. George Lombard, Yankees Age (on opening day): 20         Where he played in 2025: High-A, Double-A           Minor league stats: .235 BA (473 AB), 9 HR, 35 SB, .748 OPS, 87 BB, 146 K Most rank lists will slot Lombard higher than this, but I'm more of the seeing-is-believing type. Maybe if he had spent more of 2025 at High-A, where he batted .329 with 23 walks in 24 games, I'd feel differently, and it's possible he's been promoted too aggressively to gain a real foothold. Lombard combines superlative plate discipline with the sort of athleticism that comes from being the son of a former college football recruit (not to mention a major leaguer), but he'll need a power breakthrough soon to keep getting that benefit of the doubt.  17. Emil Morales, Dodgers Age (on opening day): 19           Where he played in 2025: Rookie, Low-A           Minor league stats: .314 BA (357 AB), 14 HR, 11 SB, .911 OPS, 48 BB, 109 K Morales captured the imagination of prospect hounds as an 18-year-old tearing up the Dominican Summer League in 2024, but it was 2025, his first season stateside, that validated his prospect credentials. He's already optimized his swing for power, which is rare for a hitter so young, hitting towering fly balls to his pull side. He'll need to cut down on the whiffs, but the fact he got better as the year went on -- hitting .351 with a .993 OPS over his final 62 games, even with a move up to Low-A -- shows he's on a good trajectory.  18. Jett Williams, Mets Age (on opening day): 22         Where he played in 2025: Double-A, Triple-A         Minor league stats: .261 BA (486 AB), 17 HR, 34 SB, .828 OPS, 76 BB, 131 K Back from the wrist injury that wrecked his 2024, Williams slashed .281/.390/.477 at Double-A, once again looking like a prototypical leadoff man with his penchant for getting on base and then swiping an extra one. His insistence on wringing every ounce of power out of his 5-foot-7 frame presents some batting average risk, and over the long haul, his power may manifest more as doubles and triples than home runs.  19. Josuar De Jesus Gonzalez, Giants Age (on opening day): 18         Where he played in 2025: Dominican Summer League         Minor league stats: .288 BA (191 AB), 4 HR, 33 SB, .859 OPS, 37 BB, 36 K Now known by most outlets as Josuar Gonzalez, the 18-year-old was regarded as the top international prospect not named Roki Sasaki in 2025, and lo and behold, he actually delivered on the hype right away, walking more than he struck out while going bonkers on the base paths and demonstrating the sort of exit velocities that should translate to power. Because he's also a switch-hitter and plus defender, the Francisco Lindor comp that you'll so often see seems apt, and while he still needs to prove himself outside of the Dominican Summer League, I'm bullish.  20. Elian Pena, Mets Age (on opening day): 18         Where he played in 2025: Dominican Summer League         Minor league stats: .292 BA (178 AB), 9 HR, 21 SB, .949 OPS, 36 BB, 36 K Pena and Josuar Gonzalez were neck-and-neck in the international prospect rankings heading into 2025, and judging by their respective debuts in the Dominican Summer League, I'm having a hard time disentangling them here. Gonzalez has opened up a lead according to most rank lists, but I think that's because Pena got off to a slower start and doesn't have as clear of a shortstop trajectory. He might turn out to be the better power hitter of the two, though.  21. Caleb Bonemer, White Sox Age (on opening day): 20         Where he played in 2025: Low-A, High-A         Minor league stats: .281 BA (385 AB), 12 HR, 29 SB, .874 OPS, 75 BB, 101 K A second-round pick in 2024, Bonemer's professional debut went even better than expected as he showed a knack for getting on base and pulling the ball in the air. The latter bolstered an already robust power projection, and if you watch the tape, you'll see that some of those pull-side home runs were absolute missiles. Questions remain about his ability to handle breaking balls, but by everything we can measure from his stint in A-ball, he passes with flying colors.  22. Franklin Arias, Red Sox Age (on opening day): 20         Where he played in 2025: Low-A, High-A, Double-A         Minor league stats: .278 BA (479 AB), 8 HR, 12 SB, .723 OPS, 38 BB, 53 K As with George Lombard, the fervor over Arias reflects a growing tendency to prioritize secondary indicators over primary ones. While reaching Double-A as a 19-year-old is great, slugging over .400 is better. Part of the appeal for these guys is that they're surefire shortstops and not simply masquerading as such, which matters more for real life than for Fantasy, but they're also relative blank slates with at least one standout tool. For Arias, it's the 10 percent strikeout rate against pitchers far more advanced than he.  23. Tyson Lewis, Reds Age (on opening day): 20         Where he played in 2025: Rookie, Low-A         Minor league stats: .311 BA (315 AB), 9 HR, 27 SB, .862 OPS, 29 BB, 102 K A high-octane player with a max-effort swing and tenacity on the base paths, Lewis exudes athleticism but will need to tone down the try-hard to harness it fully -- an age-old struggle for players like him. Of his many loud attributes, the contact quality screams the loudest and is perhaps the most cherished in the modern game, but his pitch selection and spray angle both need some work.  24. Steele Hall, Reds Age (on opening day): 18         Where he played in 2025: did not play -- draft year The Reds are apparently so enamored with Lewis that they drafted his right-handed-hitting counterpart with the ninth overall pick just a year later. If anything, Hall is even more athletic, with Baseball America classifying his speed as a true 80 grade, but the contact isn't as loud. Both are among the more volatile prospects, in need of much refinement as hitters, with speed being Hall's carrying tool and power being Lewis'.  25. Jhonny Level, Giants Age (on opening day): 19           Where he played in 2025: Rookie, Low-A           Minor league stats: .269 BA (346 AB), 12 HR, 21 SB, .797 OPS, 50 BB, 70 K Among the dozen or so shortstops that could occupy this 25th spot -- from Arjun Nimmala to Cooper Pratt to Billy Carlson and Kayson Cunningham -- Level has most captured my heart, reiterating his superlative plate discipline and surprising pop in his first year stateside and even advancing to full-season ball as an 18-year-old. Add his natural quickness and strong arm, and the whole package reminds me of the switching-hitting shortstops that dominated the early aughts -- guys like Jimmy Rollins, Rafael Furcal, and Carlos Guillen.  Bonus: Carson Williams, Rays Age (on opening day): 22           Where he played in 2025: Triple-A, majors           Minor league stats: .213 BA (389 AB), 23 HR, 22 SB, .765 OPS, 56 BB, 154 K Major league stats: .172 BA (99 AB), 5 HR, 2 SB, .573 OPS, 6 BB, 44 K I've always tried to rank Williams lower than the consensus, but judging by his first taste of the majors, I may be just as guilty of overselling him. He ran into a few homers but was plagued by crippling contact issues, and his defense wasn't even the tour de force we were promised. The ever-frugal Rays figure to give him a long leash, which is why he deserves to place among prospects still, but his chances of becoming an impact Fantasy player are dwindling. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NFL trade deadline is fast approaching and the Los Angeles Rams are getting a head start on improving their roster for a run at the NFC West. The Rams acquired cornerback Roger McCreary and a 2026 conditional sixth-round pick from the Tennessee Titans in exchange for 2026 conditional fifth-round pick.This deal isn't for one of the premier players available at the deadline, but signals the Titans are starting to sell off their roster after a dreadful 1-7 start. the Rams are on their bye week at 5-2 and are a contender for the NFC West title. So who won the trade? Or was this an opportunity for the Titans to sell off pieces during the rebuild? Let's take a quick look at the trade grades and how did deal benefits both franchises.Rams: B+The Rams needed help at outside cornerback once Ahkello Witherspoon broke his clavicle in Week 2, as Los Angeles has tried several options at the position in Witherspoon's absence. Emmanuel Forbes, Cobie Durant, and Darious Williams have taken the bulk of the reps -- but to mixed results. \nForbes has allowed two touchdowns and a 118.3 passer rating in coverage as the primary defender in the five games Witherspoon has missed. Williams has allowed one touchdown and a 59.7 passer rating in coverage while Durant has allowed 205 pass yards and a 64.6 rating in that same span. Only Durant has a takeaway, which has been an issue for the Rams secondary. Durant has the only interception by a cornerback on the Rams defense. Will McCreary help with the turnover issues? He has just one interception on the season in 184 coverage snaps, allowing an 87.8 passer rating as the primary defender. He's a proven starting cornerback with 38 career starts under his belt, and is now outside the Tennessee realm of doing things. The 25-year-old McCreary is in the final year of his rookie contract and will get an opportunity to prove he deserves an extension with a starting job in Los Angeles.McCreary can play the outside or the slot, and the Rams need help at both. All the Rams gave up was a fifth-round pick, which was originally the Titans anyway. This is a good buy-low deal.\nTitans: CHard to see why the Titans are giving up on young players, but perhaps McCreary wouldn't have been back anyway. McCreary was drafted when Jon Robinson was the Titans general manager, and that was three general managers ago. With a new head coach coming this offseason, who knows the scheme the new defensive coordinator will have -- or whether McCreary is a part of the future anyway? McCreary did seem to find his footing after a poor rookie year in which the former second-round pick allowed seven passing touchdowns, but he never seemed to be a fit in Tennessee. This is more of a product of the titans front office structuring than the player, and Tennessee will be selling off players in a lost season where the head coach was fired in October. This deal is expected to be the first in a fire sale for the Titans, as they look for their new head coach over the next several months. Only getting a fifth-round pick back -- and giving up a sixth -- for McCreary is better than nothing. This just shows the position the tItans are in, and how little they will get for solid players on their roster. \nIf McCreary figures things out with the Rams, that's an even bigger indictment of the Titans and how they develop players. \n            ",

Rams coach Sean McVay said Monday that he expects Nacua -- who has been nursing an ankle injury since Week 6 -- to return to practice on Wednesday and play in this weekend's contest.The Rams considered Nacua day-to-day ahead of their last outing but ultimately ruled him out on the injury report for the Week 7 game against the Jacksonville Jaguars in London. He received an additional week of rest after that international clash as the Rams hit their bye after traveling overseas. The bye week came at an opportune time for Los Angeles as it kept Nacua out for just one full game.Nacua landed awkwardly while attempting to make a touchdown catch in the second quarter of the Week 6 win over the Baltimore Ravens. The Rams initially labeled him as questionable to return, and while he did reenter the lineup in the second half, he played a limited number of snaps and did not log another catch.\nThe injury brought an end to a historic start to the season. Nacua led the NFL with 52 catches through five games and set a league record for the most receptions to open a campaign. He turned those catches into 616 yards, good for the second most in the NFL. He also logged two touchdowns.The Rams did not skip a beat with their star pass-catcher on the shelf. Quarterback Matthew Stafford threw five touchdown passes in a 35-7 rout of the Jaguars and completed throws to 10 different receivers in Nacua's absence. Davante Adams picked up most of the slack with a team-high five grabs but will return to a secondary role when Nacua returns to the lineup.\nNacua is not the only player set to rejoin the Rams' offense this week. Right tackle Rob Havenstein missed three games with an ankle injury of his own, and McVay said he expects the lineman to practice this week and play Sunday against the Saints.\n            \n    ",

The Commanders scored 41 points in Mariota's first start of the season and 27 in his second, so the veteran has led successful drives this season.

From the Raiders: \"George's contributions as a friend and mentor to everyone in the Raiders organization continued long after his playing career, and his genuine personality and wonderful sense of humor will be dearly missed by everyone who knew him,\" the Raiders said in a statement. \"The prayers of the Raider Nation are with Denise, Brittany, Maya, Angela, Craig and the entire Atkinson family at this time.For his career, Atkinson had 30 interceptions, 13 fumble recoveries and scored four defensive touchdowns. He also had three punt return touchdowns, including two in his rookie season. After his football career, Atkinson remained close with the organization and was part of the Raiders radio network's pregame and postgame broadcast team. \n            \n    ",

Prior to that, Albernaz was major league field coordinator for the Guardians. In earlier years, Albernaz was bullpen coach for the San Francisco Giants and also coached and managed at various levels within the Tampa Bay Rays farm system. As a player, the Massachusetts native spent parts of nine seasons in the minors as a catcher within the Rays and Detroit Tigers organizations. He reached as high as Triple-A. Albernaz inherits an Orioles team that still has a strong core of position players all in their twenties. However, the Orioles despite lots of talent finished a disappointing 75-87 this season and placed last in the American League East. Coming off consecutive postseason berths in 2023 and 2024, expectations were much higher. Those expectations cost manager Brandon Hyde his job in the middle of May. Interim replacement Tony Masolino managed a winning record over the remainder of the season (60-59), but ultimately lead decision-maker Mike Elias decided to go in another direction for dugout leadership. As such, the 2026 season brings with it a certain degree of pressure on both Elias and Albernaz to get the Orioles back into contending mode and win a playoff series for the first time in more than a decade. Elias' lack of aggressiveness in trading prospects for near-term roster needs and the lack of payroll investment from ownership remain impediments. \nNow that the Orioles are poised to name Albernaz to their post, the list of teams in need of managers for 2026 is down to five: the San Diego Padres, Atlanta Braves, Colorado Rockies, Washington Nationals, and Minnesota Twins. \n            \n    ",

At least nine teams will be changing full-time skippers heading into 2026, including the San Diego Padres, San Francisco Giants, Atlanta Braves and Baltimore Orioles.The Baltimore Orioles, coming off 75-87 season that saw them finish in the basement of the AL East, have hired Guardians associate manager Craig Albernaz. Brandon Hyde was fired in May and interim manager Tony Mansolino was not handed the full-time reins.The Los Angeles Angels, who let go of both Ron Washington and interim Ray Montgomery, have hired former player Kurt Suzuki as their new skipper. Suzuki spent parts of 16 years in the majors, including his last two with the Angels, and won a World Series ring with the Washington Nationals in 2019.The San Francisco Giants, meanwhile, went out of the box and hired Tennessee coach Tony Vitello to take over for Bob Melvin, who was fired after their season ended. Vitello, who went 341-131 in eight years as head coach at Tennessee, is the first collegiate coach to jump straight to an MLB manager job. He also never played professional baseball.\nThe Texas Rangers became Major League Baseball's first team to complete a managerial change earlier in the month, officially announcing that Skip Schumaker will take over in the dugout. Texas had previously announced a parting of ways with Bruce Bochy, the future Hall of Fame skipper who guided the franchise to its first (and to date only) World Series title in 2023.While there is going to be an unusually large amount of turnover, you shouldn't fret.

    "body": "\n        Lane Kiffin insists he's not in it for the paycheck. With two of college football's premier jobs now open -- Florida and LSU -- speculation has again turned toward the Ole Miss coach, whose name reliably surfaces anytime the sport's power programs go searching. But Kiffin made it clear Monday that financial offers won't dictate his next move.\"Just so you know, because you haven't known me very long, I have never made a decision based off money, nor will I,\" Kiffin said on \"The Pat McAfee Show.\" \"For a lot of people, they're just like, 'Well, money, and it does this and does that.' \"I've seen too many examples in life where money does not buy happiness. So I'm never going to make a decision off of money, nor do I care about it. (My agent) Jimmy Sexton gets really mad when I say that. He's like, 'We got to get this. We got to get this.' And, I'm like, 'Jimmy, I don't care.' And he goes, 'I do!'\"Kiffin's comments arrive as he guides No. 6 Ole Miss into the heart of the College Football Playoff race. The Rebels' 34-26 win at Oklahoma on Saturday improved their record to 8-1, keeping alive hopes for the program's first CFP berth -- and, in turn, heightening interest in their high-profile head coach.\n        \n            \n                LSU coaching candidates: Lane Kiffin, Dabo Swinney among options on hot board to replace Brian Kelly\n                \n                    Chris Hummer                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBoth Florida and LSU dismissed their coaches this week, entering what's expected to be the most competitive hiring cycle in recent memory. Florida moved on from Billy Napier on Oct. 19 amid another disappointing start to the 2025 season, while LSU parted ways with Brian Kelly, who is owed nearly $54 million, on Sunday.\nKiffin, long dubbed the \"Portal King\" for his aggressive use of the transfer market, would be an attractive option for either school in an effort of a quick rebuild. But timing could complicate matters: the early signing period opens Dec. 4, with playoff games starting Dec. 19 -- leaving little room for schools to wait on a coach competing deep into the postseason.Kiffin has been through this before. Auburn pursued him aggressively in 2022 before he ultimately chose to stay at Ole Miss, a decision he later credited his daughter, Landry Kiffin, for influencing.\nWhether his stance holds as Florida and LSU boosters prepare their pitches remains to be seen. But as the coaching carousel begins to spin, Kiffin is adamant about one thing: his happiness isn't necessarily for sale.\n            ",

Game 3 of the 2025 World Series gets underway when the Los Angeles Dodgers host the Toronto Blue Jays at 8 p.m. ET, and the NFL Week 8 schedule wraps up with the Washington Commanders taking on the Kansas City Chiefs on Monday Night Football. There is also a full slate of NBA and NHL games to bet. SportsLine's proven computer model is backing the Commanders and Blue Jays as underdogs in their respective games, along with the Celtics to pull off an upset against the Pelicans. Claim the latest bet365 bonus code here:Check out our bet365 promo code review for full details.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. It is on a sizzling 43-28 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Additionally, the model is up well over $10,000 for $100 players on top-rated NBA picks over the past seven seasons. The model enters the 2025-26 NBA season on a sizzling 160-118 roll on all top-rated NBA picks, returning nearly $4,000. It also enters the 2025 World Series a profitable 35-29 on top-rated MLB money-line picks this season. Anybody following its NBA betting picks, MLB betting picks and NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns. Bet games at bet365 here:Monday's top picks, best betsCommanders +11 vs. ChiefsBlue Jays +1.5 runs vs. DodgersCeltics +105 vs. PelicansCombining the model's three picks into a three-leg parlay at bet365 would result in a payout of +617 (risk $100 to win $617). Bet it at bet365 here:\nCommanders +11 vs. Chiefs Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes has struggled in this role throughout his career, going 6-12 against the spread as a favorite of at least 11 points. Washington is going to be without starting quarterback Jayden Daniels (hamstring), but wide receivers Terry McLaurin and Deebo Samuel are both back this week. McLaurin and Samuel have not been on the field together since Week 3, so they will provide a massive boost for the offense. The Commanders also lead the NFL in yards per carry, giving them enough firepower to keep this game close even without Daniels. SportsLine's model has Washington covering the spread in 54% of simulations. Bet it at bet365 here:  Blue Jays +1.5 vs. DodgersBlue Jays starting pitcher Max Scherzer is going after his third career title and is starting a World Series game for his fourth different team. He came up with one of his best starts of the season in Game 4 of the ALCS, throwing 5.2 innings against the Mariners. Scherzer is 1-1 with a 2.70 ERA in four postseason appearances against the Dodgers. Toronto scored 11 runs in Game 1, and Dodgers starter Tyler Glasnow is 1-4 with a 5.82 ERA in 11 career regular-season starts against the Blue Jays. The model has Toronto covering this spread 64% of the time, providing plenty of value at -120. Bet it at bet365 here:Celtics +105 vs. PelicansBoston and New Orleans are both winless so far this season, with the Celtics struggling to overcome a few bad defensive quarters in their losses. The Pelicans are shorthanded right now, as Kevon Looney (knee) and Karlo Matkovic (elbow) have both been sidelined. Center Yves Missi missed the last game due to a sprained ankle, and he is questionable for this game. The model expects Boston to take advantage of a banged up New Orleans team, as the Celtics are winning outright 57% of the time. Bet it at bet365 here:\nLooking for Week 9 NFL picks?You've seen the model's best bets for Monday.

The Titans get a fifth-round pick, while the Rams receive a sixth-round pick. McCreary has recorded 33 tackles, one sack, two passes defended and one interception in eight games played this season. A former second-round pick for Tennessee in 2022 out of Auburn, McCreary was viewed as a potential trade target as he is in the final year of his rookie deal and seeking a long-term extension. Despite being a consistent player in the slot and arguably the Titans' best cornerback, it's clear the front office's vision for the future did not include McCreary. In 55 NFL games played, he's recorded 253 tackles, 17 passes defensed and three interceptions. \n        \n            \n                2025 NFL Trade Deadline Tracker: Live updates and analysis as Rams bolster defense\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Rams were in the market for an instant-impact defensive back with Ahkello Witherspoon on injured reserve. Emmanuel Forbes Jr. and Darious Williams have received more playing time at cornerback in recent weeks.\nThis is the second trade the Titans have made in the last two months involving a cornerback; the team previously sent Jarvis Brownlee Jr. and a seventh-round pick to the New York Jets for a sixth-round pick. With L'Jarius Sneed on injured reserve, the McCreary trade means Tennessee is moving forward without its top three cornerbacks. More pressure will be on Darrell Baker Jr., Jalyn Armour-Davis, Samuel Womack III and rookie Marcus Harris. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        A post-spring practice insurance acquisition at Texas, quarterback Matthew Caldwell could get the start for the Longhorns in Saturday's nationally-ranked SEC battle against Vanderbilt if Arch Manning fails to come out of concussion protocol this week, Steve Sarkisian confirmed Monday. Caldwell, a senior transfer from Troy, threw the go-ahead touchdown pass in overtime over the weekend at Mississippi State on a 10-yard strike to Emmett Mosley after Manning left the game after hitting his head on the turf. Manning's 13-yard scramble put the Longhorns in position to take the lead in the extra session after he led a heroic 17-point comeback in regulation.Caldwell has appeared in five games behind Manning this season and took all first-team reps Monday with the five-star, first-year starter on the mend.Sarkisian tapped Caldwell in the transfer portal coming out of spring camp in search of a proven commodity at the position to compete with freshmen Trey Owens and KJ Lacey. Sarkisian said Lacey took second-team reps. \n\"What I liked about him on his visit was just his demeanor, his approach to it,\" Sarkisian said Monday about Caldwell. \"It didn't seem too big for him here. He didn't feel entitled by any means. He was a guy who just wanted an opportunity.\"Caldwell was Troy's starting quarterback over the second half of the 2024 season after finishing with 1,608 yards passing and 13 touchdowns to eight interceptions. Like Manning, Caldwell's a run threat, too. He had five scores on the ground over his final four games, which included three wins for the Trojans.Previously, Caldwell played two seasons at Gardner-Webb after initially signing with Jacksonville State. An Auburn, Alabama native, Caldwell has one year of eligibility remaining.\nSituationally, the Texas offense won't change much if Caldwell gets the nod this weekend.\"The biggest thing that's stood out about Matt Caldwell in limited snaps is his poise while stepping into pressure situations,\" Horns247's Eric Henry told CBS Sports on Monday. \"Both of his appearances against Power Four teams have been in high-leverage moments and he's delivered. Arch Manning loses his helmet and Caldwell is pressed into a 2nd-and-22 as Texas is trying to find a game-tying touchdown and proceeds to deliver a dime to Ryan Wingo for a first down. \"It's rinse and repeat as he steps in again on the road at Mississippi State and hits (Mosley) for the touchdown. If Caldwell has to make his first start for the Longhorns, the moment won't be too big for him.\"\nManning missing initial prep for the Commodores doesn't necessarily mean he won't suit up this weekend. Earlier this season, South Carolina star quarterback LaNorris Sellers was in concussion protocol following a hit suffered against Vanderbilt and didn't practice during the early portion of the following week in what was categorized as a day-to-day situation. However, Sellers' status was upgraded to probable on the Gamecocks' second availability report a few days later and he took every snap in the next game against Missouri.Manning could follow a similar trajectory if he's cleared to return to play. The Longhorns' first player availability report for Saturday's matchup with Vanderbilt will be released Wednesday night and will be updated twice thereafter leading up to gameday.\nManning is coming off a masterful performance at Mississippi State after throwing for 346 yards and three touchdowns, along with a score on the ground, to keep the Longhorns' playoff hopes alive.Sarkisian said Caldwell's career in varying offensive systems has prepared him for this moment -- a potential season-saving start for the Longhorns while the team waits it out with Manning.\"The good thing for Matt, he's a very even-keeled guy,\" Sarkisian said. \"I thought he had a great practice today. The players have a lot of confidence in him. He's very engaged even when he doesn't play.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        PHILADELPHIA -- A.J. Brown stood on the sidelines and watched the Philadelphia Eagles offense have its best performance of the season -- without him on the field. Brown was sidelined with a hamstring injury as the Eagles put up a season-high 427 yards and 7.5 yards per play in a 38-20 victory over the New York Giants on Sunday.Jalen Hurts threw for four touchdowns, Saquon Barkley rushed for 150 yards, Tank Bigsby rushed for 104 yards, and the Eagles scored on six of eight possessions. Philadelphia's rushing attack put up 276 yards -- the most in a game by any team this season -- and averaged 8.4 yards per carry. The Eagles scored a season high in points, and were up 25 with 5:59 left in the fourth quarter. Hurts threw a 40-yard touchdown pass to Jahan Dotson on a go route that's normally intended for Brown, to put Philadelphia up 38-13. This was Hurts' fourth touchdown of the day, and his final pass on an afternoon in which he completed 75% of his passes (15 of 20) for 179 yards and four touchdowns with a 141.5 passer rating. This wasn't Hurts' finest performance of the season. That came the week prior when he had a perfect passer rating and three touchdowns in a victory over the Vikings -- with Brown in the lineup. Yet the Eagles felt more in sync than at any point during the season in Sunday's win. \n\"That's who we are. That's Eagles football,\" said offensive tackle Jordan Mailata. \"How we played today, how we strung those last two games? That's Eagles football.\"So goes the question that doesn't need to be asked. Are the Eagles actually better off without Brown on their team? The simple answer: No The Eagles do need Brown in order to repeat as Super Bowl champions. Brown has been an All-Pro in each of his three seasons with the Eagles, a top five wide receiver who elevates the passing attack and is the go-to target for Hurts. \nBrown has been frustrated with his role in the offense, which included the cryptic social media post last week \"Using me without using me.\" This was after he finished with four catches for 121 yards and two touchdowns when Hurts had a perfect passer rating. Brown sat out this week with a hamstring injury and did not practice, just days after the social media post. He was ruled out for Sunday and the trade rumors swirled whether the Eagles would actually move him ahead of the Nov. 4 deadline (the Eagles aren't planning to trade him). Even though the Eagles had a balanced offensive attack (33 runs to 24 dropback passes) in Brown's absence, they did miss his presence in terms of spreading the ball around. Prior to Dotson's 40-yard touchdown, 13 of Hurts' 14 targets were either to DeVonta Smith, Barkley or Dallas Goedert. There wasn't a lot of spreading the ball around, even with an efficient Hurts. \nThere's where the Eagles missed Brown, even with Hurts playing the same mistake-free football he's been playing since Week 6 of last season. \"We had a pretty good idea pretty early,\" Dotson said on Brown's availability this week. \"You know, it's tough when you're missing the best receiver on your team ... one of the best receivers in the league. We have this motto in our room, there's no drop-off. No matter who goes out there, that's the standard we have to play to.\"The Eagles played to that standard for one game, but that's not an indicator of how well they'll play week to week without Brown. Defenses will adjust and the downfield attack will be taken away without Brown in the lineup, no matter how well Hurts plays. \nThe Eagles went back to their bread and butter of their offense without Brown, not having to worry about using the pass game to open up the run game. Getting a lead early via a 65-yard touchdown run by Barkley on the second play of the game helped, allowing the Eagles to lean on the principle of their offense -- or what they want it to be.There's where the frustration lies with Brown. They've won a Super Bowl this way, but with Brown on the field while doing so. They need Brown on this roster to do it again. \"I think that there's no secret [that] we want to be a balanced offense that can run, close games out, be explosive in the pass game, [and] be efficient in the pass game,\" said Eagles coach Nick Sirianni. \"Obviously, anytime you lose a player like A.J. for a game, it changes some things as far as how you go about putting guys in different positions. \n\"But if you have faith in the guys that you have that are backing him up, whether that's receiver or O-line, you still go about doing what they can do the best, but also putting them in a position to make plays.\"\n        \n            \n                Eagles' honorary tight end adds crucial wrinkle to offense, helping Saquon Barkley and run game get going\n                \n                    Jeff Kerr                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHow Brown's absence did get Barkley going Without Brown on the field, the Eagles were able to force themselves to fix the run game. This unit was 30th in rushing yards per game (88.1), 31st in yards per carry (3.3), and 23rd in yards before contact per rush entering Week 8. On Sunday, the Eagles rushed for 276 yards, averaged 8.4 yards per carry, and had 4.18 yards per contact per rush. Brown and Smith prefer the Eagles use the pass game to set up the run game, setting them up for more targets and keeping them involved. When teams decide to play back to stop the passing game, that opens up the run game -- and Barkley's opportunity for big plays.\nNo matter how efficient Hurts has been this season, teams were still giving the Eagles loaded fronts. The Eagles countered with that this week with Fred Johnson as an extra offensive lineman, a way for the offense to open up holes for their best player. Teams around the league are doing the same tendency in order to get their run game going. Barkley had a 65-yard run and 28-yard run, his two longest of the season. He averaged 10.7 yards per carry and had a season-high 174 scrimmage yards. The Eagles could concentrate on opening up the offense for Barkley without Brown available this week, not having to worry about keeping him happy (which is normal for NFL players). \"It's just being professional,\" Barkley said. \"It's knowing that not every week is going to be how you want it to be. You can't lose faith. You gotta come in and stick to the routine.\"\nThe Eagles were able to get their best player back on track. The ball will continue to go to Barkley even when Brown comes back. The defense of Jalen Hurts Hurts has been playing the best football of his career, with and without Brown on the field. He has the highest passer rating through the first eight games of the season in Eagles history (114.4), currently sitting third in the league in that category.Over the last six games, Hurts has completed 68.8% of his passes for 1,424 yards with 15 touchdown passes to just one interception for a 121.3 passer rating. In the last two games, Hurts has seven touchdowns to just nine incompletions -- compiling a 155.2 passer rating. \nBrown has been on the field for most of this stretch, a pivotal piece regarding how well Hurts has played. Hurts has a 107.2 passer rating targeting Brown during this stretch, throwing three touchdowns and averaging 12.9 air yards per attempt. \"This is the quarterback we know he can be. The best in the league,\" Dotson said. \"He's doing a great job commanding the offense, making sure we're all in the right spots and getting the ball out on time. It's nothing new to us. We see it every single day. It's cool to see it come true on Sundays.\" Several Eagles players have publicly supported their quarterback. Brown hasn't supported nor ridiculed his quarterback this season, taking things to social media to voice his frustration with the offense. Some of it is about Hurts, but the business relationship between the two carries on. \nHurts knows he needs Brown to win football games. So do the Eagles. Whether Brown feels the same way is up for debate. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        With the 2025 NFL trade deadline set for Tuesday, Nov. 4, every new deal from here on out will shape the playoff chase or accelerate a rebuild. Already we've seen the Cincinnati Bengals turn to Joe Flacco in an effort to stabilize their quarterback room, and that's just the start of what figures to be a busy few weeks. Expect fringe contenders like the Steelers and Buccaneers to explore upgrades, while teams stuck near the bottom, such as the Jets and Saints, weigh offers for veterans who could bring back draft capital.To help you track all the NFL trade deals ahead of the deadline, we'll be logging every move in one place with concise analysis highlighting who got better, who got future assets, and what it means for the season ahead. Whether it's a blockbuster involving a former Pro Bowler or a depth move that fills a key injury gap, this page will be your running guide through deadline season.Titans send Roger McCreary to L.A. (10/27)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Rams get: Roger McCreary, conditional sixth-round pickL.A. bolsters defense with veteran cornerLos Angeles is building on its strength. Already, the Rams are one of the top defenses in the NFL and have held opposing quarterbacks to an 84.6 passer rating, which is the sixth-lowest in the NFL. Despite that, the Rams have been dealing with injuries to the unit, with Ahkello Witherspoon in injured reserve. Now, they buy in on a former second-round pick who can play both inside and outside, and that versatility should be a welcome addition for Sean McVay. McCreary is in the final year of his deal, so this is currently looked at as a pure rental for Los Angeles, but it comes at minimal cost. They get a starting-caliber corner while simply moving down one round in the draft as they get a sixth-rounder in return, along with McCreary, while shipping out a fifth. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Titans get: Conditional fifth-round pickTennessee's sell-off beginsThe Titans are actually getting back their own fifth-round pick in this deal, per NFL Media. The Rams had acquired it in the deal involving Ernest Jones IV, but now get that selection back in their draft cupboard. However, it remains to be seen what the conditional aspect of this trade is, so that fifth-rounder could be the floor depending on how McCreary plays. Really, this is a move aimed at bolstering their draft board as the rebuild continues around Cam Ward and whoever they eventually hire as head coach. McCreary was a pending free agent and not in their long-term plans, so attaching a mid-Day 3 pick to an expendable player to move up a round is a prudent move. Jaguars, Browns swap cornerbacks (10/9)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Jags get: Greg Newsome, sixth-round pickLanky corner in final year of rookie dealThis is a win-now move. Jacksonville gets a solid cornerback in Newsome, who has graded out well this year, allowing just a 52% completion rate as the primary defender, on track to be the best of his career. Through five Weeks, he's Pro Football Focus' 33rd-ranked cornerback out of 85 who have played at least 150 defensive snaps; Campbell is 57th.Newsome is in the fifth and final year of his rookie deal, so he's set to be a free agent at the end of this season. There's a significant scheme adjustment here, too, as the Browns play the highest rate of man coverage in the league by far, while Jacksonville is 23rd, but clearly the Jaguars see plenty to like in Newsome. Jacksonville does take on a $19.5-million dead cap hit in 2026, but that's a problem for a few months from now.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Browns get: Tyson Campbell, seventh-round pickSolid starter getting a fresh startThis is a depth improvement for Cleveland. Campbell had a strong 2024 season after signing a four-year, $76.5 million extension, but the new Jaguars regime clearly wanted to move on from him after a slow start to this season. A significant chunk of that deal has already been paid, meaning the Browns will get to look at Campbell for nearly an entire season and evaluate how he fits both now and in the future. Campbell has had some injury issues, but when he's healthy, he's a starting-caliber cornerback, and one who's under team control well into the future.Trade grades, full analysisHarbaughs do defensive business (10/7)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Chargers get: Odafe Oweh, seventh-round pickAthletic but inconsistent edge rusherThis is a win-now move for Los Angeles. Oweh broke out last season with 10 sacks in 2024  -- double his previous career high – but the 2021 first-round pick is yet to record a sack this season. His pressure rate this season – 10.3% – is slightly lower than his 11.7% last year, but neither are particularly impressive numbers; he was at 17.2% in 2023.\nPerhaps time had simply run its course for Oweh in Baltimore. He was playing on the fifth-year option  of his rookie deal and will be a free agent this offseason. In Los Angeles, he'll play under innovative defensive coordinator Jesse Minter and hope to provide pressure both before and after Khalil Mack returns from an elbow injury. Through five weeks, Los Angeles ranks 19th in pressure rate.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Ravens get: Alohi Gilman, fifth-round pickReliable safety, plus a better draft pickI see this as a dart throw. Things have already gone majorly off the rails for Baltimore (1-4), and trading away a former first-round pick certainly wasn't on the Bingo card one month ago. But Baltimore has better depth and youth on the edge than it does at safety, where ArDarius Washington tore his Achilles during the offseason and Kyle Hamilton has been dealing with a groin injury. That left undrafted rookie Reuben Lowery to play every defensive snap of a 44-10 Week 5 loss to the Texans.Trade grades, full analysisFlacco gets new job, stays in Ohio (10/7)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Bengals get: Joe Flacco, sixth-round pickAging pocket passer hoping to raise the floorSometimes, the NFL is about optics, and the Bengals trailing 28-3 at halftime and Jake Browning getting booed off the field after his third interception in an eventual 37-24 loss to the Lions in Week 4 was bad, bad optics. Enter Flacco, whom Cleveland benched after Week 4. Through five weeks, Browning was dead last in expected points added per dropback. Flacco was third-worst.\nThe Bengals are hoping Flacco can provide a similar boost to the one he provided Cleveland in 2023, when it ended up making the playoffs thanks to a late-season surge. The Bengals don't have near the defense the Browns do, and the offensive line is a mess, but for a cheap price, it's a move that makes sense. If Flacco recaptures the magic, great. If he doesn't, this season was probably lost the moment Joe Burrow got hurt anyway. It's a total dart throw. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Browns get: Fifth-round pickA modest gain in draft positionFlacco was no longer part of the plan in Cleveland, which moves up a round in the draft. That's solid business for a team that's had its eye on the future essentially since this season began. Trade grades, full analysis\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Kyle Singler, a former NBA player and Duke standout, was arrested in Whitefield, Oklahoma, on allegations of domestic violence, according to authorities. Deputies said Singler, who retired from professional basketball in 2019, allegedly assaulted his girlfriend at an Airbnb where they were staying with their child. According to the probable cause affidavit, the victim told police that Singler attempted to rape her and physically pushed her to the ground. Investigators said the woman displayed hand-shaped marks on her face consistent with an assault. \"It looked like he palmed her face like he would a basketball and pushed her down, is what she had said,\" said Mitch Dobbs of the Haskell County Sheriff's Office, per KWTV.Authorities noted Singler appeared under the influence of narcotics and did not fully cooperate during the investigation. The toddler in the residence was unharmed, per the report. Singler, 36, was taken into custody and later released on bond.\nSingler's post-retirement struggles are part of a pattern that surfaced last November, when he posted disturbing videos on social media in which he appeared shirtless and disoriented, claiming he feared for his life and describing experiences of mistreatment and abuse. The posts drew support from former NBA teammates and peers, including Kevin Love, Andre Drummond and Isaiah Thomas, who urged fans to offer Singler support.The incident in Oklahoma marks a troubling escalation in Singler's personal issues since leaving the professional game. Singler was a star at Duke, where he helped the Blue Devils win the 2010 NCAA Tournament and was named Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four. He was named ACC Rookie of the Year in 2008 and earned all-ACC recognition four times over his college career, scoring a total of 2,392 points, which ranks him fourth on Duke's all-time scoring list behind JJ Redick, Johnny Dawkins and Christian Laettner. Singler went on to play 356 games in the NBA.\nThe Detroit Pistons selected Singler in the second round of the 2011 NBA Draft. He spent three seasons with the organization before joining the Oklahoma City Thunder from 2014 to 2018. Singler also played overseas before announcing his retirement in October 2019.\n            ",

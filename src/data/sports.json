    "body": "\n        One of the hottest players in the world over the last two weeks could not be extinguished on Thursday at Pebble Beach Golf Links. Ryo Hisatsune continued to stoke the flame in his opening round of the 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, signing for a bogey-free, 10-under 62 to grab the early lead in the first signature event of the season.Hisatsune's 62 represents his lowest career round on the PGA Tour, and it comes in his tournament debut at Pebble Beach. His previous low of 63 came just last weekend at the WM Phoenix Open, where he finished in a share of 10th place. The young man from Japan rolled in more than 150 feet of putts and even chipped in for birdie on the par-4 16th to start a run of three straight into the clubhouse. His lead going into Friday, where he will play at Spyglass Hill, is just a single stroke over American Sam Burns, who was similarly on fire on the greens en route to his 63. Keegan Bradley came in late at the same number as he missed a chance on his last hole to tie the course record on Spyglass. Burns just barely led the field in strokes gained putting on Thursday, gaining more than five strokes with the wand in hand. Hisatsune cleared more than five strokes on the greens as well.\"Anytime you can go bogey-free, regardless of where you're playing, is always a good thing, and especially to do it around here,\" Burns said. \"It was nice. I made a significant amount of putts and feel like I was hitting it pretty nice. It was a good combination for today. The weather was perfect, so we were just trying to enjoy the day.\"\nPebble Beach played nearly four strokes under par in Round 1, while Spyglass Hill played roughly two strokes more difficult. While conditions were ripe for the taking, world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler struggled yet again in the opening refrain. One week after starting his tournament with a 73, his first over-par round since June 2025, the four-time major champion signed for a 72 to fall 10 strokes off the pace -- the same deficit he faced after 18 holes at the WM Phoenix Open.Over on Spyglass Hill, Bradley was the low man with a stellar 9-under performance. The most recent U.S. Ryder Cup captain appears to have found something, while Jordan Spieth showed signs of life with a bogey-free 66. Meanwhile, last year's champion, Rory McIlroy, ran into some speed bumps on the greens and signed for a 68 to open up his title defense despite a pair of double bogeys.\nLeader1. Ryo Hisatsune (-10): The experience is beginning to stack up for the 23-year-old. Hisatsune was a member of the final group at Torrey Pines on Sunday, where he finished runner-up to Justin Rose, and he was in the final group on Saturday at the WM Phoenix Open alongside his golf hero, Hideki Matsuyama, before ultimately cashing a top 10 finish. Playing with serious confidence, the right-hander wielded the putter effectively in Round 1, cashing putts from 42, 31, 17, 16, 13 and 12 feet.  He noted that he loves putting on these poa annua putting surfaces, but his ball-striking will need to improve over the next 54 holes if he is to turn this momentum into his first victory on the PGA Tour.ContendersT2. Sam Burns, Keegan Bradley (-9)T4. Chris Gotterup, Tony Finau, Patrick Rodgers (-8)T7. Nick Taylor, Akshay Bhatia, Andrew Novak, Tom Hoge (-7)T11. Russell Henley, Jake Knapp, Jordan Spieth, Sepp Straka, Rickie Fowler, Matt Fitzpatrick, Patrick Cantlay, Mackenzie Hughes (-6)Lot of big names on the first and second pages of the leaderboard, including Gotterup, who has already won twice this season, but it is hard not to notice what Spieth accomplished on Spyglass. Not only did he hole out for eagle on the par-4 9th, he also managed his way around the par 72 without dropping a shot, maintaining the momentum he had garnered. The reason? Spieth's putting from close range. Typically good for one miss from near distance, Spieth was solid inside 10 feet and added makes from 14 and 12 feet, the latter coming on the last hole to save par and maintain his bogey-free round.\n\"I thought I was really good on and around the greens,\" Spieth said. \"I actually didn't hit many greens for how kind of well I thought I was swinging the club. I pulled a few kind of the wrong clubs. It's easy to do out here. You can pull a club you think's going to go far enough, and it just doesn't go anywhere here. So I've got to get a little tighter on some of that decision making, but when I got into trouble, I got out of trouble. \"Obviously, holing a wedge shot was probably the highlight of the day. But I just really plotted my way around. When I missed, I missed in the right spot. I'd like to get a little bit tighter as we go around Pebble, but at Spyglass 6 under may be the best I ever shot around here, so, very pleased.\"\nScheffler's strugglesFor the second straight week, Scheffler will attempt to mount a comeback from 10 strokes down across the final 54 holes of a tournament. While at the WM Phoenix Open he was upended by one hour out of an otherwise decent round, Scheffler's first round at Pebble Beach was more of a slow bleed. He missed birdie chances from 8 feet on Nos. 1-2, connected from that distance on No. 4 and then gave it back from 4 feet on No. 5. A birdie flew onto his scorecard on the par-5 6th after nearly finding the surface in two, but that was his last birdie until the last hole of the day.\nIn between them, Scheffler continued to struggle with the putter -- he missed a par putt from just inside 3 feet on No. 12 -- but it was the iron play that was uncharacteristically poor. He lost about 2.50 strokes on approach, ranked 73rd in the 80-man field in that category and failed to give himself looks from hole high consistently -- a rarity in his game.2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am updated odds, picksOdds via DraftKings SportsbookKeegan Bradley: 8-1Chris Gotterup: 19/2Sam Burns: 10-1Ryo Hisatsune: 13-1Matt Fitzpatrick: 17-1Rory McIlroy: 17-1Jake Knapp: 18-1Patrick Rodgers: 18-1For those wondering, Scheffler is listed at 35-1, a far cry from the 3-1 price tag at tournament open. No suggestion either way here, but a 65 seems certain on Friday. McIlroy may ultimately be the guy, though, as he left so many strokes out there on the greens and still managed to beat the scoring average on Spyglass by a couple of strokes. The return to his blades looked like a smart move, at least on Thursday.\n            ",

Team USA had to shake off the rust before wearing down the Latvians over the final two periods in a dominant effort.The opening 20 minutes weren't terribly impressive as the U.S. and Latvia went into the first intermission tied at 1-1. Team USA had two goals overturned due to coach's challenges, and it hit three posts while also making some uncharacteristic mistakes.The U.S. turned up the heat right from the opening puck drop of the second period, and it was all Team USA in the final 40 minutes. The Americans had the Latvians running around in their own zone for the entire second period, and Brock Nelson managed to bury a couple of goals.\nNelson was one of the game's standouts with his two goals, but Jack Hughes and Quinn Hughes (two assists each) were also littered throughout the scoresheet. Another positive for the Americans was the chemistry between Matthew and Brady Tkachuk as the brothers combined to open the scoring.There was a lot to like about Team USA's game, especially the last two periods. The passing got cleaner as the game progressed, the power play tallied two goals and the forecheck was extremely effective. This won't be the Americans' biggest test of the tournament, but it was a good start nonetheless.The Americans will try to build upon this strong start when they face Denmark in their second of three preliminary round games.\nU.S. men's hockey scheduleAll times EasternPreliminary roundThursday, Feb. 12: USA 5, Latvia 1USA vs. Denmark | Saturday, Feb. 14 | 3:10 p.m. | USA NetworkUSA vs. Germany | Sunday, Feb. 15 | 3:10 p.m. | USA NetworkQuarterfinalTBD vs. TBD | Wednesday, Feb. 18 | 3:10 p.m. | TBDSemifinalTBD vs. TBD | Friday, Feb. 20 | 3:10 p.m. | TBDBronze medal game\nTBD vs. TBD | Saturday, Feb. 21 | 2:10 p.m. | TBDGold medal gameTBD vs. TBD | Sunday, Feb. 22 | 8:10 a.m. | TBD\n            \n    ",

The Americans rolled to a perfect 4-0-0-0 record in the preliminary round, including a blowout win over rival Canada, and they will now face Italy in the quarterfinals.Team USA entered this tournament as the gold medal favorite, and it has looked the part through four games.

The team representing the home nation came up with wins over France and Japan and finished the preliminary round 2-0-0-2, which was good enough for six points and the final spot in the knockout round.The quarterfinal matchups are win-or-go-home games as the tournament shifts to a single elimination format the rest of the way. Teams will be re-seeded according to the standings prior to the semifinals.

    "body": "\n        The current DraftKings promo code gives new users $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins. Thursday features a three-game NBA slate that features LeBron James in action as the Los Angeles Lakers host the Dallas Mavericks at 10 p.m. ET. Although James will play in the NBA All-Star Game, he'll have time to rest after Thursday, which could lead to more minutes and larger usage. With James active and the Mavericks without multiple players, including Cooper Flagg (foot), the SportsLine Projection Model backs the Lakers to cover as 7.5-point favorites as one of its Thursday NBA best bets at DraftKings. The over/under for Lakers vs. Mavericks is 235.5, the highest total on Thursday's NBA odds board. The model is also backing the Oklahoma City Thunder to cover as 13.5-point favorites against the Milwaukee Bucks in a 7:30 p.m. ET matchup that will not feature Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (abdominal) or Giannis Antetokounmpo (calf). One of SportsLine's top experts has also locked in a college basketball bet for Northern Iowa vs. Belmont at 9 p.m. ET. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every NBA game 10,000 times and has returned well over $10,000 in betting profit for $100 players on its top-rated NBA picks over the past eight-plus seasons. The model enters the week before the NBA All-Star break on a sizzling 38-17 roll on top-rated NBA spread picks dating back to last season. Anyone following its NBA betting advice at sportsbooks and on betting apps could have seen huge returns.Thursday best bets at DraftKings SportsbookThunder (-13.5) vs. Bucks (-112)Northern Iowa (+5.5) vs. Belmont (-118)Lakers (-7.5) vs. Mavericks (-112)Combining the three picks into a Thursday parlay at DraftKings would result in a payout of +541 (risk $100 to win $541). Bet it at DraftKings here: (Odds subject to change):\nThunder (-13.5) vs. Bucks (-112)The Thunder certainly aren't the same team without Shai Gilgeous-Alexander in the lineup, but they are still 3-2 over their five games with the reigning NBA MVP out with an abdominal injury. They've won two of those three games by at least 27 points, with an average margin of victory of 24 points in the three wins. Oklahoma City is coming off a 136-109 win over the Suns on Wednesday to improve to 42-13 this season. Meanwhile, the Bucks are 4-4 in their eight games with Giannis Antetokounmpo out, but 1-3 against teams with a winning record. The model projects the Thunder to cover in 64% of simulations. Back the Thunder to cover at DraftKings here:Northern Iowa (+5.5) vs. Belmont (-118)\"Belmont saw its nine-game win streak snapped in an OT loss at Bradley, and now the Bruins return home to face a Northern Iowa team they dismantled by 13 in Cedar Falls,\" SportsLine expert Larry Hartstein said. \"But Northern Iowa is playing much better now. The Panthers just destroyed Murray State, the MVC's second-place team, 89-60 on the road, for their third straight win. None of Northern Iowa's last four opponents has scored more than 60 points. While the Bruins are highly efficient offensively, the Panthers hold opponents to 26.5 percent from deep. Northern Iowa has been an underdog six times this season. The Panthers have covered five of those -- the miss coming by 1.5 points at Bradley -- and beaten market expectations by an average of 8.2 points.\" Back Northern Iowa to cover at DraftKings here:Lakers (-7.5) vs. Mavericks (-112)This Dallas Mavericks lineup is certainly not what NBA fans expected to see on display at the start of the season. The Mavericks still haven't seen Kyrie Irving this season, who remains out with a knee injury. They traded away Anthony Davis. And now, No. 1 pick Cooper Flagg, who has dominated lately, is out with a foot injury. The Lakers aren't at full strength either, with Luka Doncic (hamstring) out, but only Doncic and Deandre Ayton (knee, questionable) are on the LA injury report. Meanwhile, Dallas has eight players on its injury report as either questionable, doubtful or out. LeBron James should be additionally rested, as he hasn't played since Monday, and could take on a larger role with the upcoming break. The Lakers are 32-21 compared to the Mavericks at 19-34 this season, and the model projects the Lakers to cover in 67% of simulations.\" Back the Lakers to cover at DraftKings here:\nWant more NBA, college basketball picks on Thursday?You've seen some of the model's Thursday best bets.

Now, he wants to come back to the UFC to claim it.Diaz has not competed in mixed martial arts since beating Tony Ferguson in September 2022. He parlayed his success into a big-ticket boxing match with Jake Paul. More than three years after leaving the UFC, Diaz is planning a comeback.\"Let's  not act like I didn't start a whole division bringing value to all  these guys claiming they're it,\" Diaz wrote on Twitter. \"I gave  opportunities and put notice on the dopest fights. I got unfinished  business, and I plan on going and taking what's mine ASAP. First to ever  start a division and the dopest one at that.\"Diaz was referencing the symbolic BMF title, currently held by Max Holloway. Diaz proposed the creation of the title, which emphasizes an elite action style, while proclaiming himself as \"the baddest motherf---er in the game\" at UFC 241.\"Jorge Masvidal had a good last fight,\" Diaz said after beating Anthony Pettis in 2019. \"There are no gangsters in this game anymore. No one can get it right other than me and him. I know he's a gangster, but he's no West Coast gangster.\"\nDiaz and Masvidal fought for the inaugural BMF title at UFC 244. The welterweight fight headlined the promotion's return to Madison Square Garden in New York City. Masvidal defeated Diaz by third-round doctor stoppage and was awarded the BMF title by Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson.'Lightweights Justin Gaethje and Dustin Poirier fought for the vacant BMF title shortly after Masvidal retired. Gaethje knocked out Poirier with a second-round head kick to claim the title. At UFC 300, former featherweight champion Max Holloway moved up to lightweight to challenge Gaethje. Holloway claimed the BMF title with a buzzer-beater punch that was awarded CBS Sports' 2024 Knockout of the Year. \"You're welcome motherf---ers,\" Diaz said in his post. \"I'll see you soon. I'm coming.\"\nExpect Diaz to keep a close eye on UFC 326. On March 7, Holloway defends the BMF title against former lightweight champion Charles Oliveira. The numbered event, streaming exclusively on Paramount+, takes place in Las Vegas.\n            \n    ",

Over the course of those two weeks, athletes from 92 countries -- not including Russia or Belarus -- will compete in 16 different sports.At the 2022 Beijing Olympics, the United States finished tied for third in the gold medal count, just behind Norway and Germany. The U.S. brought home nine gold medals, which was tied with China in that category, but the Americans finished fifth in the overall medal count with 25.Team USA will try to improve upon those numbers in 2026, and they have some golden opportunities to do just that. Both the men's and women's hockey team should be in the running for a gold medal, Jordan Stolz is a favorite in speed skating, Chloe Kim is hitting the halfpipe in snowboarding and Mikaela Shiffrin will once again be on the ski slopes. And figure skaters Alysa Liu and Ilia Malinin have high potential to reach the podium.\nNorway will attempt to defend its title as the most awarded country in the Winter Olympics, both from 2022 and all-time. The Norwegians won 16 gold medals and 37 total medals at the Beijing Games four years ago, and they possess a large edge in the all-time medal count. Norway has won 148 gold medals and 406 total medals in its 24 appearances at the Winter Olympics. The Americans are a distant second with 330 total medals.Russian and Belarusian athletes are permitted to compete, but only as individuals under a neutral flag. They'll be classified as \"Individual Neutral Athletes,\" and their medals won't factor into the overall count. Russian and Belarusian teams are still banned from competing the Olympics.\nKeep track of the live medal count over the next couple weeks as the United States looks to fill up its trophy case while competing across Northern Italy.

    "body": "\n        UFC is deep into planning mode for an unparalleled spectacle. The mixed martial arts leader will host a fight card from the White House this summer. Fans have questions and the UFC is beginning to reveal some details for the historic event.Last year, President Trump proposed a UFC event at the White House as part of America's 250th celebration on for the Fourth of July. One month later, UFC president and CEO Dana White confirmed the promotion would indeed produce the unique event. Nearly every major name in the sport has expressed interest in fighting at the White House. Fan speculation is running rampant about what the card will look like.Take a look below at everything you need to know about the upcoming UFC White House card.When will the UFC White House card take place?The card is tentatively scheduled for June 14, coinciding with President Trump's 80th birthday. The President originally pitched the card for Independence Day before it moved to June. UFC has not confirmed a start time. Currently, main cards for numbered events begin at 9 p.m. ET, while most Fight Nights stateside start at 8 p.m. ET.\nWhat will the event look like?Fighters will walk from the Oval Office to the Octagon. The Octagon will be erected on the South Lawn. White expects fewer than 5,000 spectators to attend, citing security concerns. In February, Ari Emmanuel, CEO of TKO Group Holdings, UFC's parent company, estimated 3,000 to 4,000 spectators on the South Lawn. White proposed setting up large screens at nearby The Ellipse Park, which can accommodate up to 85,000 fans. \"We have this video rendering of what this looks  like,\" White explained. \"We literally have the trees in the South Lawn, so we'll know  exactly where the sun is until it sets. All the logistics are done.\"\nWho is fighting at the White House?No fights have been announced yet for the White House. White and matchmakers met in the second week of February to start putting the card together. Emmanuel speculated that there would be six or seven fights total on the card in an interview with Pat McAfee. Many fighters have expressed their desire to fight on the card. Conor McGregor rejoined the UFC drug testing pool in preparation for a potential return. More recently, UFC welterweight champion Islam Makhachev proposed a super fight with lightweight champion Ilia Topuria. The promotion will likely start rolling out a fight card over the next few months.\n            ",

Just a day after the San Antonio Spurs agreed to release him, Sochan plans to sign with the New York Knicks for the remainder of the season after he clears waivers, ESPN's Shams Charania is reporting.Sochan, 22, was the No. 9 overall pick out of Baylor in 2022, back when the Spurs were very much in a rebuilding mode. At times placed into a sort of point-forward role as a developmental project with defensive promise, Sochan showed glimpses but generally struggled to find consistency. He averaged 11.0 points on 43% shooting as a rookie and 11.6 points on 44% shooting in his second season.\n        \n            \n                NBA standings predictions: Projecting 1-15 in each conference with two months left in regular season\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLast year, he had his most efficient season, scoring 11.4 points per game on 54% shooting. But persistent perimeter shooting woes -- he's a career 29% 3-point shooter -- came to a head this year, especially with rookie Carter Bryant's emergence. Sochan appeared in just 28 games (zero starts) for the Spurs this season, averaging 12.8 minutes and 4.1 points. He appeared in just two of San Antonio's last 12 games before his release.The Knicks targeted the 6-foot-8 Sochan at the trade deadline but couldn't get a deal done, per SNY's Ian Begley. Given his defensive versatility and athleticism, he could end of figuring into New York's rotation, even for just certain matchups. Even if he doesn't, New York is in essence simply taking a flyer for a young player with upside; Charania reported Sochan had 10 potential suitors.\nNew York is 35-20 this season, third in the East and a half-game behind the Boston Celtics for second. The Knicks also added defensive-minded guard Jose Alvarado at the trade deadline.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        One of the most valuable freshmen in the sport may have played his last game in college.North Carolina announced Thursday afternoon that stellar freshman forward Caleb Wilson suffered a left hand fracture during the first half of the Tar Heels' 75-66 road loss against Miami on Tuesday.\"X-rays taken during the game were negative, and he returned to play later in the second half vs. the Hurricanes, but additional imaging done in Chapel Hill revealed the fracture,\" per the school. \"The evaluation process is ongoing to determine the timetable for Wilson's return.\"Wilson played 26 minutes against Miami, his fewest against a power-conference opponent this season. He also logged a season-low 12 points.\nImpact on UNC's lineupBroken hands can sometimes lead to extended absences, so there is no telling whether or not Wilson will be able to suit up in the near future, or if the injury and subsequent rehab will force him to sit deep into March. Wilson has been one of the best freshman performers in what's increasingly considered the deepest one-and-done class in college basketball history. At 19.8 points and 9.4 rebounds per game, Wilson has doubly proven to be among the best freshmen in Carolina history. His 17 20-point outings are the most by any first-year player for the program. Wilson played all 40 minutes in UNC's instant-epic win over rival Duke on Saturday, scoring 23 points to go with four rebounds, two assists, two steals and a block. North Carolina also notes Wilson's 66 dunks are the most of any player in college basketball. Without Wilson, UNC loses formidable inside defense, scoring, flexibility and recovery. There is no replacing his motor or stamina, either. UNC ranks outside the top 40 in defensive efficiency at KenPom and has relied on Wilson's unrelenting hustle and playmaking to make a jump this season after barely making the 2025 NCAA Tournament. \nUNC has been playing an eight-man rotation for the majority of the year. The Heels' four starters will remain Henri Veesar in the middle, Jarin Stevenson in the frontcourt (likely moving from the 3 and replacing Wilson as the 4-man), veteran shooting guard Seth Trimble and freshman Derek Dixon, a rising star running the point in the backcourt. The most likely tweak to keep UNC with some viable size in its most common lineup will be to inject 6-6 swingman Luka Bogavac into the starting five. The 22-year-old from Montenegro started 13 games earlier in the year.Backup shooting guard Jonathan Powell and point guard Kyan Evans (who's started 17 times) will see their roles increased as well. Everyone else has played spot duty. Can UNC go seven-deep as it turns toward the month-long stretch to Selection Sunday?\nNCAA tourney seed outlook TBDThursday's news makes North Carolina one of the most interesting teams to track over the next month. There's a wide spectrum of outcomes in play because the loss of Wilson will be problematic for a 19-5 Heels crew that is ranked 11th this week but doesn't have an NCAA seed projection that harmonizes with its AP ranking. The Tar Heels are currently hovering between the 6- and 7-line in CBS Sports' most recent NCAA Tournament bracketology outlook. Depending on how the Tar Heels play in the weeks ahead without their most talented player, the committee will evaluate (but not necessarily punish) UNC with and without Wilson. Now, if UNC can win way more often than not without its most vital player, the committee will reward the Heels accordingly. \nThe next game is manageable: UNC hosts lowly Pitt on Saturday, then has back-to-back road tests against North Carolina State and Syracuse. Home games against Louisville and Clemson still await (both are pacing toward healthy tourney seeds) and of course there's the season finale at Duke.An Atlanta native, Wilson projects as a top-five draft prospect. North Carolina hasn't had a player drafted in the top five since Marvin Williams went No. 2 in 2005.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        A new era of Pac-12 football is near with the rebuilt conference set to debut this fall. The eight-team league announced its 2026 schedule on Wednesday, which features a round-robin slate and a unique \"flex\" matchup for each team in Week 13. That flex week could prove instrumental in determining the College Football Playoff picture as the Pac-12 seeks to establish itself as the preeminent Group of Six league and send one of its members to the 12-team tournament.The modest size of the reimagined Pac-12 creates a reality in which teams cannot play more than seven conference games. Maintaining a three-game nonconference slate with a bye week leaves one unclaimed date on each squad's schedule, and it is with that open slot that the Pac-12 will introduce the flex games.The flex week introduces one repeat matchup per team. Every program will play a Pac-12 team it faced earlier in the year, but importantly, the Week 13 rematch will not count towards conference standings. Last year effectively provided a trial run of this format, as Oregon State and Washington State played a home-and-home wherein the first game counted as an official Pac-12 contest and the second was a non-conference battle.Here is everything we know about the Pac-12 flex week and what it could mean for the conference's CFP outlook.\nFlex week gives Pac-12 unique advantage in CFP raceAs with every other Group of Six conference, the Pac-12 aims to produce one of the five highest-ranked league champions in college football to secure an automatic bid into the CFP. Pairing two former power conference programs in Oregon State and Washington State with five top-flight Mountain West schools and a rising Sun Belt contender gives this league a bevy of potential playoff hopefuls.The flex week allows the Pac-12 to assess late in the season which of its teams have the most realistic paths to the CFP and to dynamically adjust their schedules to increase their odds of earning berths.Say Boise State stands at No. 15 in the CFP rankings in mid-November and that no other Group of Six teams are in the top 25. The Pac-12 could hand the Broncos a highly winnable matchup in the flex week to ensure they remain undefeated.\nOr perhaps Fresno State is in a battle with teams from the American and Sun Belt and needs a marquee win to set itself apart. The conference could pit the Bulldogs against the second-best team in the league in hopes that they win and boost their profile.Furthermore, since the flex game is a nonconference matchup, the top two teams in the league can lose in Week 13 and still participate in the Pac-12 Championship Game. That offers some margin for error where a highly regarded team could still qualify for the CFP as a conference champion even with a late-season loss.Pac-12 flex week stipulationsWhile the Pac-12 has complete authority over which teams play which in Week 13, it still must abide by one key rule with regard to game locations. That is, teams are guaranteed at least six home games in total and four against conference opponents. Since half of the league will only play three conference home games, the other half is guaranteed to play at home during the flex week.\nColorado State, Fresno State, Utah State and Washington State will host their flex games regardless of their opponents.Additional considerations could come into play in determining the matchups, but there are no guarantees. The Pac-12 specifically noted in its schedule release that it will attempt to prevent repeat road trips. For example, since Boise State has a road game at Fresno State in Week 6, the league would try not to force the Broncos to play the Bulldogs at Valley Children's Stadium again in Week 13.Projected Pac-12 flex matchupsThe Pac-12 announced four projected matchups for Week 13. These contests follow the aforementioned criterion of no team playing two road games against the same opponent.\nBoise State at Utah StateTexas State at Colorado StateSan Diego State at Fresno StateOregon State at Washington StateIn practice, the conference will likely need to be lenient when it comes to repeat road trips. Any deviation from these projections will almost certainly force at least one team to play a second game in an away stadium.When will Pac-12 flex games be determined?Flex games will be finalized no later than six days ahead of kickoff. That makes Sunday, Nov. 22 the deadline to announce the Week 13 pairings. Matchups could be determined before that date, though.One disadvantage of this deadline is that the Pac-12 must set its flex games prior to the Week 13 CFP Top 25 rankings release. That is less than ideal since the conference aims to use the flex week to better position its playoff contenders, but the Week 12 rankings and results should help the conference to make an informed decision.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        One of the top NFL storylines this offseason is the saga between the Las Vegas Raiders and their star pass rusher, Maxx Crosby. The five-time Pro Bowler was shut down by the franchise in December due to a knee injury -- a decision Crosby \"vehemently\" disagreed with, according to Jay Glazer of Fox. After the way that situation was handled, Crosby is reportedly going to reevaluate his future with the organization. There has been some mixed messaging with this situation. Glazer for example believes Crosby's time with the Raiders is over, but Crosby has not requested a trade, and is in a \"great place\" with the team, according to NFL Media. However, according to Albert Breer of The MMQB, the Raiders have a lot of work to do to repair their relationship with Crosby. And his frustration with the franchise reportedly goes all the way to the top.\"There's a lot of fence-mending that's going to need to happen if the Raiders are going to hang onto Maxx Crosby,\" Breer said on NBC Sports Boston. \"It goes all the way to the top of the organization with Tom Brady and Alex Guerrero. The way the communication happened with the injury in December left a mark. This is a guy who's incredibly loyal to the Raiders organization, wanted to spend his entire career there, and is loyal to Mark Davis as well. Now, he feels betrayed.\"\n        \n            \n                Maxx Crosby mock trades: Five blockbuster deals that could shake up the NFL\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nYou may recognize Guerrero's name. He's been connected to Brady since his New England Patriots days as a trainer and former business partner. Now, Guerrero is listed on the Raiders' official website as the team's wellness coordinator where he \"oversees several departments to ensure and enhance the health and well-being of players, coaches, and staff.\"\nAccording to Breer, a lot of people in the organization report to Guerrero now, and he's viewed as the \"eyes and ears\" of Brady.  Where he comes into the equation with Crosby is that Guerrero was apparently part of communicating to the star pass rusher that he was being shut down. This \"really angered Maxx,\" Breer said.  Crosby also reportedly had a \"strong suspicion\" that the reason he was shut down was for the Raiders to tank for the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. Vegas was successful in doing so. \nCrosby has refused to address the noise surrounding him, saying recently on the \"Let's Go!\" podcast that he's focused on his family and training. \n\"My focus has been on getting healthy because that's all I can control right now,\" Crosby said, via NFL.com. \"That's all that matters to me is being with my daughters and being with my wife and taking care of myself. People are gonna have rumors.\"I just looked at my phone -- I've been working all morning. Everyone's hitting me up, 'Did you say this?' I can't control that. You earn that as a player. If I wasn't doing the right things and if I wasn't the person and player I was, people wouldn't be talking about all the nonsense. But that's what comes with it. If you have drama, if you have a losing season, they just try to throw gasoline on the fire and make things a certain way.\"New Raiders coach Klint Kubiak was introduced earlier this week, and he was able to meet with Crosby -- who apparently was the first player in the building working out. Kubiak could play an important role in soothing whatever tensions may exist between Crosby and the Raiders. \"We want him to be a part of our success going forward, theres no doubt about that,\" Kubiak said. \"He's one of the best players in the NFL. That's a no-brainer, to get to work with Maxx and see him continue to have success with this organization.\"Crosby is indeed one of the best players in the NFL regardless of position. Since entering the league as a fourth-round pick out of Eastern Michigan in 2019, he has recorded the most tackles for loss (133), the fifth-most QB hits (164) and sixth-most sacks (69.5) while playing the most snaps among all defensive linemen (6,112). Breer says a \"bunch of contenders\" will have interest if Crosby is made available for trade. It remains to be seen if Vegas will do that. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        UEFA Women's Champions League returned to action with the knockout phase playoffs, and the first-leg fixtures delivered decisive results but also left the door open for others. Defending champions Arsenal traveled to Belgium to face tournament underdog favorite OH Leuven and defeated the home side, 4-0, in a ruthless display of their recent top form. Real Madrid visited Paris FC and weathered the storm in the French capital with a 3-2 come-from-behind victory. Wolfsburg and Juventus offered a captivating look at how anything can happen in the Champions League. Juventus, led twice, only to let victory slip in the final minutes of stoppage time, and settled for a 2-2 draw. Meanwhile, Man United cruised to a convincing 3-0 win at Atletico Madrid.Here are some takeaways from the first-leg matches:Arsenal's return to formThe Gunners might be fourth on the table domestically and now contending for a spot in the UWCL quarterfinals, but they're looking like the team that no one wants to face right now. For Arsenal, their 4-0 win against OH Leuven was a performance that reminded everyone that they're returning to form at the perfect moment. Despite an inconsistent league phase that kept them out of the top-four quarterfinal spots, the group also picked up a fourth consecutive clean sheet. It shows off a run of defensive prowess and clinical attacking that all but implies the title holders are peaking at the right time. \n\"They're making my job so easy, man, this retirement life is great. When your old team is doing phenomenally well, they just keep winning. And look still early stages, right? We just got knockouts, but I think you guys summed it up really well, and I'm glad we get to continue the conversation, because they're a joy to watch right now,\" former Arsenal defender Jen Beattie said on CBS Sports' post-game coverage.\"To break down a team that plays in a low block takes a lot of patience, and I think when a lot of rotations are in a squad, we spoke about this before, it's hard to get [those] connections. And I think it was a really professional performance, and one that is really confident going back playing at the Emirates, knowing you've got that level of occasion.\"The blowout win by the Gunners reflected their current form and the gap between a team that's the reigning title holders and tournament debutants. Arsenal generated 2.67 xG from 19 shots, while Leuven managed just 0.14 xG from five attempts, and a brace by Frida Maanum and relentless efforts by Olivia Smith, who also scored a goal, paced the winners.\nSmith led the team with the most touches in the box (16) and a match-high five shots. She also won eight duels and completed six of 10 dribbles. Unfortunately, a late yellow card for time wasting means she'll miss the second leg, but Arsenal look well on their way to a quarterfinal meeting against Chelsea FC. Manager Renee Slegers' adjustments have paid off with four consecutive wins in the Champions League, and she'll have to make them again for the next leg.\"I'm still close with the girls still playing, and everything that you would want from a manager, I always think as a player, you just wanted to know what your role was. I think that was the key to a happy camp ... When you're playing for a top team, you never know what 11 is going to come up in the team sheet. And I generally think that competitiveness is why everyone wants to play for a top team. So it's the communication. I think she's [Slegers] very, very direct. I think that she doesn't go off on tangents when players go and ask for explanations of why certain things might be happening,\" said Beattie.\n\"The more directness that someone can tell you exactly where you stand, and I think their plans have been exceptional ... They just have this versatility about them. And I think coming up to the business end of the season, as I love to call it, is where you have to be playing against so many different teams. They're going to come at you in different ways. And to be versatile in those moments are really key. So, I think she's used her squad phenomenally well and been direct and communication of how she's handled every single character in there\"\nReal Madrid hang on for decisive game at homeIf Arsenal's display was one of successful dominance, Real Madrid's was a nervy ride that needed resilience to get through. The Spanish side had never defeated Paris FC in Champions League competition, and it nearly looked like things were trending in history's favor after just ten minutes when the Parisians got on the scoreboard first thanks to Kaja Korosec's volley. \n\"Real Madrid showed a really good game. I think both of these teams have a lot of tenacity, and you cannot write them off. Even Paris FC getting a goal late into the match, trying to claw their way back at home, I think, gives them extra motivation, in a way,\" said Darian Jenkins on CBS Sports. \n\"This is a team that's never lost to Real Madrid until now, they're gonna want that back. And I think when you're a team like Paris FC, use that as motivation, but the game is still open. It almost feels like a draw, in a way. It doesn't feel like a full win, just because the game was so choppy and back and forth.\"The back-and-forth continued during the match before Real Madrid leveled just before halftime, with newly appointed Scotland captain Caroline Weir tipping the momentum in Madrid's favor. Colombian international Linda Caicedo maintained the tempo and ultimately delivered the game-winner for the visitors. For her crucial intervention, Caicedo earned Player of the Match honors. The 20-year-old has four goal involvements in her last five tournament appearances. Her run of form is a strong example of how she's evolving into the game-changing star that the club signed at 18. Despite Caicedo's heroics, there was a final jolt of nerves when Paris FC's Maeline Mendy reduced the deficit with a goal and gave the team a lifeline heading into the second leg. \n\"When you're up three one, and then you get scored on the last minute of the game, you're still winning three two. But it does feel like, 'Oh, I didn't, maybe I didn't do enough.' And I think Real Madrid might be feeling that way, but I think they also have to look at the positive side of this. They're winning 3-2. They're going home with an advantage. They finally broke that spell. They beat Paris FC, and they're playing well, defensively they just have to be better,\" said Janelly Farias.\"I think it's just they're being passive. Maybe they're being complacent, like individually, giving the ball away, someone gets a shot from long range, like little details. I think as a defender, if that's your primary role, you want to block the shot. You want to step to the player with the right timing. You want to not let the player turn if the cross comes in; you want to block the cross. I think it just comes down to them wanting it that much more. They have the quality, they have the talent. Now they just have to want it that much more, not just when they're in the final third, not just when they're attacking, but when they're defending their own goal.\"Wolfsburg and Juventus duke it out for a drawJuventus had a chance to deliver an upset in Germany and instead will settle for no advantage in the second leg against Wolfsburg. \nThe Italians took control of the game early, thanks to Ana Capeta, the club's January signing from Benfica. A near-post finish in just her second start with the team got them going. Juventus frustrated Wolfsburg with their defensive shape, and were unafraid to get physical at times, which further annoyed the German side for large stretches of the game. Capeta was a key component for Juventus' successes, and played provider on the go-ahead goal just past the hour mark for Amalie Vangsgaard's header. It was a game-stopping moment, with the home crowd at AOK Stadium going silent and upset watch was on.Unfortunately, Juventus are no strangers to letting game leads slip away, and Wolfsburg took advantage of a game-changing moment. Janina Minge converted a penalty in the 82nd minute to cut into the deficit, and heartbreak for the Italians followed in stoppage time. \nSarai Linder nailed a world-class finish at the death, getting on the ball 20 yards out and striking a curling ball inside the far post to end the match, 2-2.\nWhile both sides will have an even slate during the second leg, it's hard to ignore that this was one that got away for Juventus. The Serie A side were five minutes from defeating a European giant on their own turf, and instead, they leave Germany with a draw that feels like a defeat. A missed opportunity, and they'll have to carry the weight into Turin.Manchester United keep putting up clean sheetsManchester United's defense is part of their Champions League DNA, and their first-leg knockout phase match was another reminder at Atletico Madrid's expense. \nUnited center back Maya Le Tisser is a major factor on the backline. Alongside centerback partner Dominique Janssen and in front of U.S. women's national team goalkeeper Phallon Tunis-Joyce, Le Tisser came up with big shot blocks in the second half to maintain United's lead. \n\"Manchester United are known for their clean sheets in the WSL and the Champions League. I think the way that they've shot out in the top side and kept those really low scoring games has been really key to their center back painting. Of course, American [Phallon] Tullis-Joyce in the net, we love to see it, but the center back painting for me, for sure. Dominique Janssen and [Maya] Le Tisser are really key, staying connected, organizing everyone in front of them. So key for tonight,\" said Beattie.\n\"She's one of the most underrated center backs in European football, and I think it is because of her age and lack of caps for the Lionesses, but then you're talking about other strong Lionesses, England internationals that play ahead of her, Alex Greenwood, Leah Williamson, players we know very well. Maya Le Tisser is that next top center back in Europe.\"\n            ",

Utah carried a seven-point lead into the fourth quarter against Orlando, yet fell, 120-117. The Jazz were up three points entering the final quarter against the Heat, but pulled out a 115-111 victory. The Pacers on the other hand were fined $100,000 for violating the Player Participation Policy during a Feb. 3 matchup against the Jazz. An investigation revealed that star forward Pascal Siakam and two other starters who did not play could have participated under the medical standard in the policy. In its press release, the NBA said the Pacers could have held the players out of other games that would have been in compliance with its policy.\"Overt behavior like this that prioritizes draft position over winning undermines the foundation of NBA competition and we will respond accordingly to any further actions that compromise the integrity of our games,\" NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement.  \"Additionally, we are working with our Competition Committee and Board of Governors to implement further measures to root out this type of conduct.\"\nEntering Thursday night, the 18-37 Jazz ranked third-worst in the West, while the 15-40 Pacers ranked second-worst in the East. Both teams are far outside of playoff contention and will be in the NBA Draft lottery, however, each of the three worst teams in the league have a 14% chance to win the top pick and currently the Pacers are fourth-worst and the Jazz are sixth-worst overall.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Spring training camps opened this week and almost immediately, Major League Baseball saw three notable players succumb to hamate bone injuries: Francisco Lindor of the Mets, Corbin Carroll of the Diamondbacks and Jackson Holliday of the Orioles. Lindor and Carroll are expected back by Opening Day, but Holliday's return will be \"measured in weeks\" after the regular season starts, according to president of baseball operations Mike Elias.The first question that comes to mind with every sports fan out there: why do we only seem to see this injury in baseball? For starters, that's not actually true, even though MLB players do seem to dominate the headlines. Golfer Bryson DeChambeau, for example, missed two months in 2022 after fracturing his hamate bone. But it's all about the equipment.\"This injury is unique in that it only really occurs with a direct blow over the most prominent part of the hamate bone, known as the hook of the hamate,\" Dr. Rodney Benner, an orthopedic surgeon in Indianapolis, told CBS Sports. \"As such, the only way it usually happens is when the end of a bat, golf club, hockey stick or some other object directly impacts the area. Hitters in baseball get jammed or a forceful check swing, which causes the end of the knob if the bat to impact the hamate. This can also happen grounding a golf club or making a similar motion with a hockey stick.\" The next place our minds go is to the preventative aspect. Is there anything hitters can do? The answer is not a ton, really. \n\"There are pads that can be worn over the hook of the hamate to try and cushion the area,\" Benner said. \"Unfortunately fractures of the hamate can still happen.\"And then there's the power. Players returning from broken hamate bones and subsequent surgery have long been assumed to lose their power, at least temporarily. In going back though the last 10 seasons of data, there isn't actually evidence of a loss of power upon return. Here are some prominent cases with decent samples of statistics on both sides of the injury.In 2016, Francisco Cervelli was slugging .293 before the injury (49 games) and slugged .352 after his return (52 games).It was only a 12-game sample before the end of the season, but in 2016 Mark Reynolds returned to hit .281/.378/.500. He was hitting .283/.354/.446 before the injury.Superstar José Ramírez came back for three games in late September after his hamate injury. He homered twice in his first game back and once in his second. Tommy Pham dealt with this in 2020. He hit .207/.316/.293 in 23 games before the injury and .222/.300/.370 in eight games after his return to close the season before hitting .375/.400/.458 in six playoff games. Aristides Aquino homered in his first and fourth games after returning in 2021. Mike Trout in 2023 returned for just one game before re-injuring his wrist to end his season. He was himself to start 2024, homering six times in the first 11 games. Still, it's always possible there are lingering issues, as with any procedure.For years, we've heard stories, including from famed surgeon Dr. James Andrews, about youth players and their parents asking to have preventative Tommy John surgery without even having torn the ulnar collateral ligament in their elbow. Could we apply that mindset here and see players wanting to have their hamate surgery (removal of the bone) without it actually being injured?\nFormer All-Star Andrew Benintendi had his hamate bone removed after breaking it in college, only to somehow break it again in 2022. It was unclear at the time if the bone had regrown or not been fully removed.\"I am not aware of anyone advocating for removing the hook of the hamate to prevent injury in an athlete that does not have pain or other symptoms associated with it,\" Benner told CBS Sports. \"However, athletes can experience chronic pain in the hamate from repetitive trauma to the area, as opposed to a one-time acute injury on a specific swing. Nonsurgical treatment is possible in chronic cases in those athletes, but there is a high risk of continued symptoms or progression of the injury resulting in a complete fracture and subsequent surgery. It is possible to fix the hook of the hamate with a screw, but nonunion (failure of healing) of the fracture is common, so many athletes have the hook excised rather than fixed. Excision can usually result in rapid return to play within 6-8 weeks. However, mild strength loss and tenderness in the area can limit the ability to swing the bat effectively in the early phase of return to play. The ulnar nerve, one of the main nerves in the wrist and hand, is also nearby, so nerve complications are possible with surgery.\"The expectation here is that, while players continue to get bigger and stronger -- swinging harder -- while facing pitchers that throw harder and harder, we'll continue to see this injury pop up predominantly in baseball. The good news is it's a relatively quick-and-easy procedure and players are back to being themselves shortly thereafter. May that be the same for Lindor, Carroll and Holliday.\n            ",

The Patriots have played well on offense with Drake Maye, and much of the media focus has been there, but the defense needs to be getting more attention for how well that unit has played. That matters against an anemic Jets offense. Pats will keep rolling. Pick: Patriots 30, Jets 10 | Odds via DraftKings SportsbookWashington Commanders at Miami Dolphins (-2.5) (in Spain)Sunday, 9:30 a.m. ET on NFLN (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)The Commanders will once again start Marcus Mariota at quarterback for the injured Jayden Daniels. But the big problem is the defense. They don't cover, tackle or rush the passer. The Miami offense played well against the Bills last week and I look for that to carry over here. Look for De'Von Achane to again have a big day.  Pick: Dolphins 31, Commanders 21 | Odds via DraftKings SportsbookCarolina Panthers at Atlanta Falcons (-3.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)These two have had weird, inconsistent seasons, but this is basically a game to help keep their playoff chances alive. The Panthers have trouble throwing the football, which will be a challenge here. The Panthers need more from Bryce Young, but I don't think they get it. Falcons win it. Pick: Falcons 24, Panthers 17 | Odds via Caesars SportsbookChicago Bears at Minnesota Vikings (-3)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)The Vikings need to get their offense going with J.J. McCarthy in this one. The Bears are 6-3 and have played well on offense, but the defense has been leaky at times. I also think the Vikings' pass rush and blitzes will impact Caleb Williams into turnovers. Vikings take it. Pick: Vikings 27, Bears 20 | Odds via BetMGMCincinnati Bengals at Pittsburgh Steelers (-5.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)The Bengals are off a bye, while the Steelers are coming off a road loss Sunday night to the Chargers. The Pittsburgh offense did little in that game, but the Bengals defense is the perfect tonic to fix that. The Bengals will score too, but just not enough. The Steelers will win a high-scoring game.   Pick: Steelers 36, Bengals 30 | Odds via Caesars Sportsbook, where new users get 20 100% profit boosts with the code CBS20XGreen Bay Packers (-7) at New York GiantsSunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)The Packers are coming off a Monday night loss to the Eagles, while the Giants will be playing their first game after coach Brian Daboll was fired. Mike Kafka takes over. The Green Bay offense has been lifeless the past two weeks, but that will change in this game. Jordan Love will sling it around as the Packers win it. Pick: Packers 30, Giants 20 | Odds via BetMGM\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 11 picks and score predictions: Chiefs edge Broncos in thriller, Rams top Seahawks in NFC West clash\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHouston Texans at Tennessee Titans (+7)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)The Texans should have C.J. Stroud back for this one against a Titans team coming off a bye. The Titans have major offensive issues and the Texans defense is No. 1 in the league. That's trouble. But something says the Titans stay around in this game with the Texans offense mustering little on the other side. The Texans will win a close one.Pick: Texans 23, Titans 19 | Odds via DraftKings SportsbookLos Angeles Chargers (-3) at Jacksonville JaguarsSunday, 1 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)This is a long trip for the Chargers after a Sunday night game, but they are getting a Jaguars team coming off a demoralizing loss last week to the Texans. How will they respond? I look for Justin Herbert to have a good day against a team that doesn't rush the passer or excel in coverage. Chargers win it.Pick: Chargers 27, Jaguars 20 | Odds via Caesars SportsbookTampa Bay Buccaneers at Buffalo Bills (-5.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)This a big game for both teams, but much bigger for the Bills. They looked awful in losing to Miami last week. The Bucs might be going into a game against a team that is desperate to get a win. Josh Allen didn't play well last week. He will in this one. Bills take it. Pick: Bills 30, Buccaneers 23 | Odds via FanDuel SportsbookSeattle Seahawks (+3) at Los Angeles RamsSunday, 4:05 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)This is the game of the week. Both teams have a real shot to be the top seed in the NFC. Both teams can throw it deep and both teams can rush the passer. Matthew Stafford has been on fire, but this Seattle defense is special. They will get after him and that will be the difference in the game, with the short fields from turnovers leading to Seahawks points. Seattle wins in an upset.   Pick: Seahawks 24, Rams 23 | Odds via FanDuel SportsbookSan Francisco 49ers (-2.5) at Arizona CardinalsSunday, 4:05 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)These two suffered bad losses this past weekend, giving up over 40 points each. The Cardinals will start Jacoby Brissett again at quarterback, while it should be Mac Jones again for the 49ers. Look for Jones to get it to Christian McCaffrey a bunch, both as a runner and receiver, to find a way to win it. Pick: 49ers 30, Cardinals 24 | Odds via FanDuel SportsbookBaltimore Ravens at Cleveland Browns (+8)Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)The Ravens have come to life with Lamar Jackson back, but they are playing consecutive road games. It won't matter. The Browns have a good defense, but the offense is limited. The Ravens and Jackson will win it, but it's close thanks to the Cleveland defense. Pick: Ravens 22, Browns 16 | Odds via FanDuel SportsbookKansas City Chiefs (-3.5) at Denver BroncosSunday, 4:25 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)The Chiefs are coming off a bye and Andy Reid's teams are great off the bye. The Broncos are rested having played last Thursday. Their offense is an issue right now with Bo Nix struggling. Look for the Chiefs defense to limit him and Patrick Mahomes will do enough to win it. Pick: Chiefs 23, Broncos 17 | Odds via FanDuel SportsbookDetroit Lions at Philadelphia Eagles (-2.5)Sunday, 8:20 p.m. ET on NBC (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)The Lions are playing consecutive road games, while the Eagles are playing on a short week. That kind of cancels them out. The Eagles have had trouble scoring, while the Lions rolled up big numbers last week. But at home, look for the Eagles defense to slow down the Lions, while the Eagles get their offense going for the win.          Pick: Eagles 31, Lions 27 | Odds via DraftKings SportsbookDallas Cowboys (-3.5) at Las Vegas RaidersMonday, 8:15 p.m. ET on ESPN/ABC (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)This is a bad Monday night game, but it features two national teams with a high profile. That matters to the networks. The Cowboys made some improvements to the defense at the trade deadline, which will help that unit make some strides in the right direction. The Dallas offense can score. The Raiders offense has issues, which will again show up. Look for the Cowboys to win it behind Dak Prescott.Pick: Cowboys 31, Raiders 20 | Odds via DraftKings Sportsbook\n            ",

Tuesday features games in the NBA, NHL, college football and college basketball. We're zeroing in on Senators vs. Stars in the NHL, Ohio vs. Western Michigan in college football and New Mexico vs. UC Riverside in college basketball. Western Michigan 5-1 against the spread in its past six games at home, but SportsLine's model is backing the Bobcats, who are 10-1 in their last 11 games in conference play. Picks from all three of those games are among our Tuesday best bets at FanDuel Sportsbook from SportsLine's team of experts and the SportsLine Projection Model. Claim the latest FanDuel promo code, which gives new users $150 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: Check out our FanDuel promo code review for full details.The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times. Since its inception, it has generated a betting profit of over $2,000 for $100 players on its top-rated college spread football picks.

They have won nine games, eight of which were victories by one goal, including a streak of six consecutive one-goal wins. Both teams have a goal differential of -3. However, Dallas has a shot differential of -37, while Ottawa is at +27,\" SportsLine NHL expert Jeff Hochman said. \"Linus Ullmark will be in goal for the Senators, and he's 2-0 with a 1.46 GAA and .952 save percentage against Dallas over the last three seasons. With both teams playing their third game in four days, let's ride with the Senators at home.\" Back the Senators at FanDuel Sportsbook:Ohio money line vs. Western Michigan (+102)Both of these teams are in a four-way tie atop the MAC standings at 4-1 in conference play, but Ohio is the defending league champions and will be riding high coming off a crucial 24-20 win over Miami (OH), who is also 4-1. Sieh Bangura rushed for 102 yards and a touchdown while also catching three passes for 30 yards in the win and he's settled back in as one of the best backs in the MAC after leaving Ohio for one-season stint at Minnesota. Western Michigan's run defense has been boom or bust all season, so a lot rides on Bangura's ability to find traction. The model has the Bobcats winning in 72% of simulations. Back Ohio at FanDuel Sportsbook:UC Riverside +19.5 vs. New Mexico (-108)\"Mountain West sources are suggesting that the Lobos are a work in progress for new HC Eric Olen (via UCSD), who has an entirely new roster in Albuquerque and already giving a long look to various frosh, including top early scorers F Tomislav Buljan (via Croatia) and G Jake Hall. UNM is barely hitting 40% from the floor and 30% beyond the arc vs. limited opposition in two games,\" legendary college basketball handicapper Bruce Marshall said. \"Meanwhile, reports from the Big West indicate UCR could be a sleeper under new HC Gus Argenal, most recently a winner at CSUSB. Argenal obviously worked the portal hard for a collection of far-flung transfers such as G Marqui Worthy Jr (18.5 ppg; via UMass) & F Osiris Grady (18 ppg; via UVU).\" Back Dallas at FanDuel Sportsbook:\nWant more college football and basketball picks?You've seen some of the model's best bets for Tuesday.

    "body": "\n        Awards week in Major League Baseball continued on Tuesday. On Monday, Nick Kurtz of the Athletics won the American League Rookie of the Year Award for 2025 and Drake Baldwin of the Braves claimed the Jackie Robinson Award in the NL. The Cy Young winners in each league will be revealed on Wednesday night and Thursday will wrap things up with the Most Valuable Player awards. As for Tuesday, the AL and NL Managers of the Year were unveiled. These awards are voted on by 30 members of the Baseball Writers Association of America (that's two per MLB city in each league). Votes were submitted before the beginning of the playoffs, meaning that only regular-season contributions are taken into account.Here, then, are MLB's Manager of the Year award winners for 2025.Murphy repeats as NL winnerFor a second straight year, the Brewers' Pat Murphy is NL Manager of the Year. Murphy prevailed in the voting over the other two finalists, Terry Francona of the Reds and Rob Thomson of the Phillies. Here's a look at the voting:Manager1st 2nd3rdTotal pointsPat Murphy, Brewers272-141Terry Francona, Reds291249Rob Thomson, Phillies17632Craig Counsell, Cubs-7324Clayton McCullough, Marlins-5722Torey Lovullo, D-backs--11Mike Shildt, Padres--11Murphy this season led the Brewers to an MLB-best 97-65 record, which was good for both the NL Central title and top overall seed in the postseason. Murphy's and the Brewers' success in 2025 came once again despite a low payroll and the exodus of more talent -- including shortstop star Willy Adames, who signed a free-agent contract with the Giants last offseason. Murphy's 2025 team was notable for its crisp play in the field and on the bases, deep lineup, and well-run bullpen. Murphy won the award in 2024 thanks to a 93-win season in Milwaukee and a division title. In the playoffs, the Brewers were swept by the Dodgers in the NLCS, but to get there they prevailed over the division-rival Cubs and former Brewers manager Craig Counsell in the NLDS.  \nMurphy becomes the first back-to-back winner of NL Manager of the Year since Bobby Cox of the Braves in 2004 and 2005. Overall, he's the first repeat winner since Kevin Cash of the Rays won the AL award in 2020 and 2021.Vogt is AL winner againSteven Vogt of the Guardians has repeated as AL Manager of the Year, as he won the balloting over his fellow finalists John Schneider of the Blue Jays and Dan Wilson of the Mariners. Here's the full voting breakdown:Manager1st 2nd3rdTotal pointsStephen Vogt, Guardians1784113John Schneider, Blue Jays1011891Dan Wilson, Mariners291350Alex Cora, Red Sox1-27AJ Hinch, Tigers-136Vogt piloted Cleveland to 88 wins and an AL Central title over the heavily favored Tigers. Vogt's case for the award gained steam down the stretch thanks to a miracle comeback by the Guardians. Cleveland fought back from 15 ½ games out in the AL Central, which made it the largest comeback in the divisional era (i.e., since MLB split into divisions in 1969). As well, Vogt's Guardians trailed the Tigers by 14 games as late as July 9 and by 9 ½ games as late as Sept. 10. Cleveland's 20-7 record in September played a leading role in that comeback and, thus, Vogt's winning of the award. This, of course, is to say nothing of the Guardians' low payroll and very limited commitment to winning from ownership.\nVogt has now won the hardware in each of his first two seasons as an MLB manager.\n            ",

This week, in things we didn't think we would ever be saying, it sure looks like Cade Otton and Dalton Schultz are both must-start tight ends. In my early Week 11 projections, they both project as top five tight ends. In our early Week 11 tight end consensus rankings, they are both in the top eight. What could go wrong?That question is probably easier to answer for Schultz. The last time we got really excited about starting Schultz, he scored 4.4 PPR Fantasy points. We all felt ashamed and immediately dropped him in the rankings. We should have ignored it. In his last two games he has averaged 16 PPR Fantasy points. In fact, Week 8 is the only game in his last five that he has scored less than 10 PPR Fantasy points. His matchup against the Titans doesn't look great on paper, but we are starting him anyway.Otton is an easier case to make. With Mike Evans and Chris Godwin out, Baker Mayfield doesn't have much choice to throw to Otton. He had 12 targets last week and has 37 in his last five games. His low point total in that stretch is eight PPR Fantasy points. Like Schultz, Otton has a bad matchup on paper, but you aren't going to find anyone on the waiver wire who we like better.We are not just starting the hot hand at tight end. We are going back to ice cold Jake Ferguson coming off a bye, we're starting Travis Kelce against a defense that has erased Ferguson and Brock Bowers in recent weeks, and we are ignoring Kyle Pitts' disappointing Week 10. The one guy we don't want to start is T.J. Hockenson, he is not a top 15 tight end for any of our rankings.Here's everything else you need to know about tight end in Week 11:\n\n        Week 11 TE Preview\n    \n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    TE Preview\n                \n                            \n                    Numbers to Know\n                \n                    \n            22.7 -- The Bengals are giving up 22.7 PPR FPPG to tight ends, the highest mark in the league. Good luck guessing which Steelers tight end it will be this week. We like Pat Freiermuth the most.10.6 -- Travis Kelce has the most points of any tight end against the Bills this year, 10.6. Hopefully, Cade Otton tops that.16.7% -- Brenton Strange had a 16.7% target share in the first month of the season. He is eligible to come off Injured Reserve and could have an even bigger role if both Brian Thomas and Travis Hunter are out.84 -- George Kittle had 84 receiving yards in Week 10. That's more than he had in his last three games combined. He's back.20.4 -- Travis Kelce scored 20.4 PPR Fantasy points the last time he faced the Broncos.21.9% -- Harold Fannin had a disappointing Week 10, but he still had a 21.9% target share. We are going right back to him.51.2% -- David Njoku barely ran half of the routes for the Browns.

main slate so McBride is projected to give you a five point edge on the field at tight end this week. In four games with Jacoby Brissett his worst score on FanDuel is 14 Fantasy points and he has twice topped 24 points. Don't overthink tight end in cash games, play McBride.\n            \n            \nContrarian DFS Play\n                        Projections powered by\n                        \n                            Sportsline\n                        \n                    \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        BAL\n                    \n                         \n                        Baltimore\n                    \n                                            • #80\n                                            \n                                            Age: 25\n                                                                        • Experience: 4 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        CLE\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    BAL -8\n                                    O/U 40.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS TE\n                                \n                                9th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                6.2\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                    \n                                \n                                    TE RNK\n                                \n                                NR\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    10\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    14\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    103\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    0\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    3.4\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Sometimes the contrarian tight end is a good tight end I don't think will be rostered. Sometimes, like this week, it's a bargain basement special who could give big value. Isaiah Likely is a bit of both. He's only $4,800 on FanDuel, and just had a 17% targets share last week. The last time the Ravens played the Browns they could not get Derrick Henry going. If that happens again it could be a high volume passing game for Lamar Jackson, which would benefit Likely.\n            \n            \n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    TE Preview\n                \n                            \n                    Heath's Projections\n                \n                    \n            My full set of Week 11 Fantasy football projections for every position is now available on SportsLine.

Embiid and the Sixers were hopeful that procedure would clear up his issues and allow him to get back on the floor more regularly, but now he finds himself dealing with an issue with his right knee. \"No expectations at all,\" Nurse said when asked if Embiid could miss multiple games. \"We are going to see what they say about the imaging.\"\nEmbiid has injured his right knee before, suffering a right knee sprain during the 2023 Playoffs in the first round against the Brooklyn Nets that limited him going forward. This season, Embiid has appeared in six of the Sixers' 10 games and averages 19.7 points and 5.5 rebounds per game while being limited to 20-25 minutes of action. Despite a cautious approach to his minutes load early in the season, he finds himself dealing with knee soreness once again.  The Sixers have held him out of back-to-backs, including their most recent game against Detroit, but his absence on Tuesday night raises new concerns, as it comes after two days off.\nThe 76ers are 6-4 on the season thanks to a sensational start from their young backcourt led by Tyrese Maxey and rookie VJ Edgecombe. \n            \n    ",

And that's the case once again on Saturday when UFC makes its annual trip to Madison Square Garden for UFC 322. A pair of superfights tip the bill with (now) former champions moving up in weight in pursuit of glory in a second division. In the main event, Islam Makhachev moves up from lightweight to welterweight to challenge Jack Della Maddalena for the 170-pound title. In the co-main, Weili Zhang moves from strawweight to flyweight to face Valentina Shevchenko for the 125-pound crown.Technically, champion vs. champion super fights are a thing of the past because UFC CEO Dana White's new philosophy requires champions to vacate their titles before changing divisions. That's exactly what happened with Makhachev and Zhang, who relinquished their UFC titles to move up in weight and become two-division champions. Makhachev (27-1) set the record for most UFC lightweight title defenses, eclipsing mentor Khabib Nurmagomedov and others, before moving up to challenge Jack Della Maddalena in the latter's first title defense. Della Maddalena inspired some confidence that he can give Makhachev a tough fight after busting up Belal Muhammad to become the 170-pound champion.Zhang Weili dominated women's strawweight before leaving Mackenzie Dern to pick up the vacant strap at UFC 321. Her second reign as champion saw her beat Amanda Lemos, Yan Xiaonan and Tatiana Suarez. Now she seeks to put an end to Shevchenko's second women's flyweight title reign, which Shevchenko kick-started after ending her series with former champ Alexa Grasso.Below is the complete fight card for UFC 322, along with the latest odds.

    "body": "\n        The usual suspects reigned supreme on Tuesday in the UEFA Women's Champions League, with OL Lyonnes and Chelsea rising to the top of the table after notching lopsided wins to kick off Matchday 3.Lyon are currently the only team with a perfect record after three games, with Barcelona and Manchester United in the mix to join them in their matches on Wednesday. The eight-time UWCL winners snapped Wolfsburg's winning streak in the process, veterans Ada Hegerberg and Wendie Renard leading the charge on a new-look team in another showcase of the group's title-winning potential. Chelsea, meanwhile, assumed full control in Austria with a 6-0 win over St. Polten, Sam Kerr and U.S. women's national team star Catarina Macario each bagging a brace to put the Blues just two points behind Lyon.The most dramatic result on Tuesday came in Spain, where Real Madrid salvaged a point with an equalizer in the 98th minute against Paris FC, keeping the hosts in the mix for the top four spots that guarantee a direct berth in the quarterfinals.Tuesday's resultsRoma 0, Valarenga 1Real Madrid 1, Paris FC 1St. Polten 0, Chelsea 6OL Lyonnes 3, Wolfsburg 1Lyon, a cut above the rest?Wolfsburg's trip to Lyon marked the latest chapter in a storied rivalry between the two sides, who have met in four Women's Champions League finals in the last decade and change. These two teams, though, have headed in completely different directions since they met in the 2020 final, Lyon's 3-1 win fully indicative of their diverging paths.\nRare are the days when a team underperforms their expected goals tally on a day they score three but Lyon did just that with four expected goals from 21 shots, conceding just two chances along the way. Much has been made of Lyon's new look but on Tuesday, two veterans stood above the rest – Hegerberg and Renard. Hegerberg bagged a brace and generated 1.32 expected goals on her own, the Ballon d'Or winner a perfect showcase of Lyon's strengths. The 30-year-old may not always hog the spotlight but no one Lyon needs to – the team boasts goalscorers like Kadidiatou Diani and has hoarded so much midfield talent that Lily Yohanens came off the bench. Manager Jonatan Giraldez has an embarrassment of riches at his disposal, perhaps making his side the early favorites to collect the title.\nUSWNT stars impress for ChelseaChelsea's American invasion was on full display at St. Polten, where the USWNT trio Macario, Naomi Girma and Alyssa Thompson each named amongst the starters. Macario in particular, had a standout outing in Austria with two goals and a whopping 11 shots, while the same was true for Kerr as she scored a brace in her first start for the Blues in nearly two years. Their tallies were indicative of a fully dominant performance for Chelsea, who took 42 shots and conceded just one, generating 5.38 expected goals along the way. Chelsea are back on track in the Champions League for the time being, their depth their strongest quality, but stiffer tests await as they chase their first-ever title. Their Matchday 4 meeting with Barcelona will offer a truer assessment of the Blues' ability to go the distance, especially as they target a top four finish.\nReal Madrid rescue a late pointReal Madrid may no longer be perfect in the Champions League but they managed to finish Tuesday's match on a high with a last-gasp equalizer against Paris FC, scored by Scotland international Caroline Weir. The hosts were arguably deserving of the goal – Paris may have limited them to just five shots on target from 23 total attempts but Real Madrid's expected goal tally was 2.73, making for a solid outing despite the result. The Spanish side might be a surprise contender in Europe this season, currently sitting third in the table and in the midst of an impressive season in which they have lost just once so far. A big week awaits with a league fixture against Barcelona and a Champions League meeting with Arsenal; they may be the underdogs in both matches but they are not to be underestimated.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The latest College Football Playoff Rankings saw plenty of change among the at-large spots after a chaotic Week 11 slate. Three teams featured in the previous bracket were cycled out of the field during Tuesday's rankings reveal after getting upset to bring in an entirely new round of competitors. BYU was the most notable casualty, as the Cougars lost their spot after a 29-7 loss on the road against Texas Tech. BYU was still listed as one of the first teams out, so there is a path back to the playoff if the Cougars finish the year on a high note. The same cannot be said for Virginia, which plummeted from projected ACC champion to out of the race entirely after it suffered a home loss to unranked Wake Forest. Memphis was supplanted by fellow American Conference power South Florida as the Group of Six's representative, as well. Though the lower rungs of the bracket went through some change, the projected first-round byes remained entirely unscathed. Ohio State, Indiana, Texas A&M and Alabama still occupied the first four seeds.  \nThis bracket is a projection heading into Week 12. Here is a look at how the College Football Playoff bracket looks after the second CFP Rankings release. \n                                                                    CBS Sports design\n                                                            ACC still in the hunt for multiple bids The selection committee choosing to rank Miami first among ACC teams and subsequently projecting the Hurricanes as the conference's champion is an odd choice. The chances that Miami actually makes the ACC Championship Game are next to zero. The Hurricanes already have two losses in conference play, which puts them behind the five one-loss ACC teams atop the league's standings. In the event that chaos reigns, Miami would still lose head-to-head tiebreakers against Louisville and SMU. \nThis does mean that the ACC's hopes for multiple bids are still alive. It's clear that, regardless of its ACC championship status, the committee thinks highly of Miami. The Hurricanes also have a head-to-head advantage against another potential bubble team in Notre Dame, which remained at No. 9 Tuesday. There's a world in which the ACC champion -- be it Georgia Tech, Virginia, Louisville or a team outside the rankings -- and Miami both make the cut come December. \n        \n            \n                College Football Playoff Rankings reaction: Why Miami -- ACC's highest-rated team -- won't make the field\n                \n                    Shehan Jeyarajah                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTexas Tech pushing for a bye Texas Tech jumped one spot to No. 6 following its monumental rout of BYU. While a miniscule move may not seem significant in a vacuum, the Red Raiders vaulted over Ole Miss and came one step closer to securing a first-round bye. \nIf Texas Tech can finish the regular season undefeated and cap things off with a Big 12 championship, it will have a case to secure a top-three spot at the very least. The current top four consists of two SEC teams and two Big Ten teams. Only half of that field can actually win a championship. A 12-1 Texas Tech with a Big 12 title would be a stronger candidate for a top-four seed than an SEC or Big Ten school that lost in their championship game. Vanderbilt hanging around Vanderbilt's had a tough November. The Commodores suffered a major setback on Nov. 1 when they lost to Texas and then got taken to the brink in a Week 11 showdown against an Auburn team that is 1-6 in conference play. \nDespite the latest streak of less-than-desirable results, though, Vanderbilt actually moved up two spots to No. 14 in the latest poll. Given that the Commodores rank ahead of a couple of projected conference champions, they're still a little outside of the \"first team out\" range, but they are well within shouting distance of an at-large spot. If they can take care of business against Kentucky and No. 23 Tennessee to finish with a 10-2 record, that would likely be enough to make the cut in an expanded field. \n            ",

OSU (8-0, 5-0 Big Ten) is off to a dominant start this season with wins over Texas and Illinois, and it thoroughly took down Purdue on Saturday to keep its resume intact. Its final game against a ranked opponent comes in its regular-season finale against Michigan.Eight of the 11 teams ranked No. 1 in a season's initial CFP Rankings ultimately reached the playoff, an effort now made easier with the expanded 12-team field, which is being contested for a second season.Currently projected to meet Ohio State in the Big Ten Championship Game is Indiana (10-0, 7-0 SEC), which eked out a 27-24 win at Penn State to remain undefeated. IU's final two games are against teams with combined records of 5-14 overall, 1-12 in Big Ten play.\nAlabama and Georgia round out the top five, which is entirely comprised of Big Ten and SEC teams for the second straight week.The CFP Selection Committee's key move this week was raising Texas Tech two spots past Ole Miss and Oregon after the Red Raiders' 29-7 win over BYU. Miami (FL), despite being ranked No. 15, takes the 11th bid as the highest-rated team from the ACC.South Florida claims the last of the 12 playoff spots as the highest-ranked Group of Five team in Tuesday's release at No. 24. With the 12-team playoff model granting automatic bids to the five highest-ranked conference champions, USF is presently projected to win the American and grab the final spot in the field. Should a Group of Five team not make the final rankings, the CFP Selection Committee would choose which champion deserved the last bid.\n    College Football Playoff Rankings, Nov. 11* First-round bye | ~ First-round host | ^ Highest-ranked Group of Five teamOhio State (9-0) *Indiana (10-0) *Texas A&M (9-0) *Alabama (8-1) *Georgia (8-1) ~Texas Tech (9-1) ~Ole Miss (9-1) ~Oregon (8-1) ~Notre Dame (7-2)Texas (7-2)Oklahoma (7-2)BYU (8-1)Utah (7-2)Vanderbilt (8-2)Miami (FL) (7-2) | No. 11 seedGeorgia Tech (8-1)USC (7-2)Michigan (7-2)Virginia (8-2)Louisville (7-2)Iowa (6-3)Pittsburgh (7-2)Tennessee (6-3)South Florida (7-2) ^ | No. 12 seedCincinnati (7-2)SEC's drive for five bidsNobody outside of the SEC wants to hear this, but this end-of-season stretch is coming up roses for a conference that has long been an advocate for further expansion. There's a chance at least five teams could finish with 10 wins -- and as many as seven -- if 11th-ranked Oklahoma beats Alabama and No. 10 Texas upends Georgia this weekend. That would result in a possible squeeze scenario for various at-large options from other conferences -- and also Notre Dame -- if the committee hammers home its record strength and strength-of-schedule components. What's more likely to happen is Texas A&M, Alabama, Ole Miss and Georgia each securing spots with wins this weekend, which would leave Vanderbilt as the only SEC team left with a 10-win opportunity. Then, we could see a situation unfold in which the SEC's fifth entry -- and fourth at-large -- comes down to the Commodores or a nine-win Texas if the Longhorns topple Texas A&M in two weeks. We're considering Oklahoma's trip to Tuscaloosa as a playoff elimination game for the Sooners, but Texas could slip up at Georgia and still have a path.Slotted No. 5 in the committee's second rankings, Georgia is still capable of getting a top four seed and opening-round bye by winning out, but the Bulldogs will need help. The clearest trek is this: If Oklahoma beats Alabama this weekend and the Crimson Tide take care of business against Auburn during the regular-season finale, Alabama gets to the SEC Championship Game. Then, a loss to possible unbeaten Texas A&M puts the fourth-ranked Crimson Tide at 10-3 overall on selection day with Georgia right behind. Would the committee swap Alabama for the Bulldogs receiving the last first-round bye despite the Crimson Tide's head-to-head in September win due to overall record? It's possible. Georgia would be riding an eight-game winning streak into the postseason with final month victories over nationally ranked Texas and Georgia Tech.\n        \n            \n                College Football Playoff Rankings reaction: Why Miami -- ACC's highest-rated team -- won't make the field\n                \n                    Shehan Jeyarajah                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHigh stakes for Oregon, USCThe Ducks and Trojans won't meet until Nov. 15, but that showdown is arguably the most important game left in the Big Ten's playoff picture as long as eighth-ranked Oregon beats Minnesota and No. 17 USC handles Iowa this weekend. By winning out, Lincoln Riley's team would rise in the rankings and get one of the final at-large spots given their previous victory over a possible 10-win Michigan -- should the now 18th-ranked Wolverines stun Ohio State for a fifth consecutive season -- and what would be quality wins over the Hawkeyes and Ducks. \nWe've projected the Big Ten to be a three-bid conference throughout the season and it looks like that third and final entry will come down to the Ducks and Trojans unless hell breaks loose in Week 12 prior to the two teams' anticipated showdown. Pay attention to rivalry games that come after USC-Oregon, too. The Trojans close with UCLA, while the Ducks go to Washington. Big Ten fans may want to shield their eyes from the final bracket reveal should the Bruins and Huskies upset those two ranked teams. In short, a 9-3 finish is not going to be good enough to get in for Oregon or USC. Route for *two* Big 12 teamsDespite Texas Tech coach Joey McGuire's rally cry for the Big 12's multi-bid needs following his team's 29-7 win over the Cougars last weekend, the committee spoke loud and clear with how it power ranks the conference against the SEC and Big Ten. Moving BYU back from No. 7 to No. 12 behind Texas and Oklahoma shows the league has major work to do if it expects two entries in the bracket. Best-case scenario for the Cougars is winning their next three games against TCU, Cincinnati and UCF to reach the Big 12 Championship. There, BYU would have a rematch opportunity against the Red Raiders and would make the playoff with a win. The committee would have to decide what to do with an 11-2 Texas Tech thereafter. Last season, SMU was designated as the last team in after finishing 11-1 before losing to Clemson in the ACC title game, giving that conference two bids. While this committee is different and you can't really judge year over year, history could repeat itself and the Big 12 would have two entries if the widely accepted narrative that conference championship doesn't widely skew seeding rings true.\nGroup of Five scenariosUSF debuted in the rankings at No. 24, the first Group of Five to receive any designation this season from the committee. And with rules regarding the Group of Five's highest-ranked conference receiving one of five auto-bids, the Bulls are in good shape by winning out. Our updated projection this week prior to the committee's second reveal was North Texas getting the Group of Five bid under the notion the Mean Green win out and get to the American Championship Game -- and then win a rematch with USF after losing to the Bulls, 63-36, earlier this season. For that to come to fruition, North Texas needs Tulane to lose to FAU, Temple or Charlotte over the final three weeks. We're going to take a mulligan there and as of right now, the frontrunner is now USF from the Group of Five. JMU, Tulane and North Texas are also in the mix, with Navy and Memphis on the fringe. San Diego State's blowout loss at Hawaii in Week 11 means this season's projected Mountain West champion is out of the picture.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NWSL officially awarded Atlanta with an expansion team on Tuesday, with the league's 17th franchise scheduled to begin play in 2028 and set to stage home matches at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, home of MLS' Atlanta United and the NFL's Atlanta Falcons.Atlanta's NWSL expansion team is backed by AMB Sports and Entertainment, the organization that also owns United and the Falcons and is led by Home Depot co-founder Arthur Blank. AMBSE also owns Mercedes-Benz Stadium, which opened in 2017 as a multipurpose venue. While the venue seats 71,000 for NFL games and can expand to 75,000, Mercedes-Benz Stadium usually holds 42,500 for United matches. For the incoming NWSL team, the stadium will use its modification techniques for an expected capacity of around 28,000.The NWSL will reportedly collect an expansion fee of $165 million for the Atlanta franchise, according to The Athletic, the largest in the league's history. The ownership group behind the Denver Summit, which begin play next year, reportedly paid a $110 million entry fee earlier this year, while fellow 2026 expansion side Boston Legacy and 2024 entrant Bay FC reportedly paid around $53 million each.Blank's investment will include staff dedicated specifically to the NWSL team, as well as their own training ground. NWSL-specific training grounds are quickly becoming an area of focus for NWSL ownership groups, with the Kansas City Current and Angel City amongst the teams with their own facilities. Additionally, The Arthur M. Blank Family Foundation will provide seed funding to launch the NWSL Foundation, which will be focused on advancing research and innovation in women's sports and have a specific emphasis on female athlete performance and health.The NWSL's new expansion chapterAtlanta is the first market to be awarded with an NWSL expansion team since the league moved to a \"rolling process,\" as commissioner Jessica Berman has described it. Since Berman assumed her role in 2022, the league has overseen two expansion rounds with a fixed deadline for bids but made the switch after becoming familiar enough with the process of welcoming four new teams.\n\"We made the decision to shift to a rolling process mostly because we've been through [these] two rounds and so we pretty much know the universe of people who are interested,\" Berman said in September. \"There's more than a dozen of them. These conversations are ongoing and each of them have a different perspective on how much time they need to launch, the investments they need to make in order to be successful, including potentially around infrastructure and we want to not force a square peg into a round hole. We want to be more flexible so that we can get the best possible result for the next round.\"Atlanta fits the NWSL's recent expansion strategy in more ways than one. Blank now has a well-documented investment in soccer with United and his $50 million commitment to U.S. Soccer's National Training Center in the suburb of Fayetteville, which is expected to open in 2026 and will bear the businessman's name. The city was also once the home of the Atlanta Beat, which played in the Women's United Soccer Association and Women's Professional Soccer before those leagues folded. The appetite for women's soccer does not end there – Mercedes-Benz Stadium set the U.S. women's national team's attendance record for a friendly on home soil when 50,000 filled the venue for a 2-1 win over Japan in April 2024.The NWSL has also favored major media markets in recent expansion endeavors. From 2022 to 2028, they will have added teams in four of the U.S.' top 10 media markets – the LA-based Angel City, Bay FC, Boston Legacy and the Atlanta team. As for Denver, home of the Summit, the city ranks inside the top 20 and has the perk of an international airport.\nAtlanta, though, will be the first NWSL expansion team despite the intent of playing on artificial turf rather than artificial grass. Mercedes-Benz Stadium would not be the first NWSL stadium with artificial turf – the Portland Thorns and the Seattle Reign, two of the league's original teams, play on artificial turf at Providence Park and Lumen Field, respectively. Boston Legacy, meanwhile, will play their inaugural season at Gillette Stadium, which is primarily an NFL venue, like Mercedes-Benz Arena and Lumen Field.\n            ",

The Blue Devils are off to a 2-0 start to the season after picking up wins over Texas and Western Carolina, while Army is coming off an 83-76 loss to St. Thomas (Minnesota). This game will be the ultimate crossover for former Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski. He graduated from West Point and began his head coaching career with Army before taking the job with the Blue Devils in 1980. Krzyzewski will be recognized prior to tipoff.The Blue Devils are entering a new era after reigning CBS Sports National Player of the Year Cooper Flagg departed to the NBA. Duke is led by star freshman Cameron Boozer, who is a projected top-three pick in the 2026 NBA Draft. He is coming off his best performance of the season after posting 25 points in a blowout win over Western Carolina. Army is led by Kevin McCarthy and Jackson Furman, who both enter this matchup averaging 16 points per game. McCarthy scored a team-high 18 points during the Black Knights' 73-49 win over SUNY-Maritime. Here is everything you need to know ahead of Duke's matchup with Army on Tuesday. \n Where to watch Duke vs. Army  live  Date: Tuesday, Nov. 11 | Time: 7 p.m. ET   Location: Christl Arena -- West Point, New York \tTV: CBS Sports Network [Channel finder]  Live stream: CBSSports.com | Mobile: CBS Sports App Duke vs. Army: Need to knowDuke's starting lineup has been as expected: Heading into the season, there were four spots in the Blue Devils' starting lineup accounted for: Isaiah Evans, Cameron Boozer, Dame Sarr, and Patrick Ngongba II. However, the final spot (point guard) was up for grabs between junior Caleb Foster and incoming freshman Cayden Boozer -- the brother of Cameron. Ultimately, Foster won the job and has been in the starting lineup in each of the first two games. Foster was part of Duke's star-studded 2023 recruiting class, and his role has fluctuated throughout his time in Durham. With a more steady role in place, Foster is someone to keep an eye on to steady the ship after Tyrese Proctor played that role last season.Army vs. Duke is a rare matchup: In the past 40 years, only one current Power Five program has traveled to West Point to face Army: Duke. The Blue Devils won that matchup 78-45 against Army on Nov. 16, 1997. Almost 28 years later, Duke will return to West Point for a fun nonconference showdown. In true nonconference road games, Duke is 3-3 over the last 10 years. Army is looking to pull off a huge upset. The Black Knights are 2-43 all-time against ranked opponents and have lost their previous 24 games over that span. The last win against a ranked team came in 1977, when Army defeated Kansas State.Duke's top-ranked recruiting class is headlined by the potential No. 1 pick: Since taking over for Coach K, Duke coach Jon Scheyer has done an excellent job on the recruiting trail. The Blue Devils landed the No. 1-ranked class last year, headlined by former No. 1 overall pick Cooper Flagg, and once again have a top-tier class. Duke finished as the No. 1-ranked recruiting class again this past cycle -- which included landing Boozer -- the No. 3 overall prospect in the cycle. Also in that class were Sarr, Boozer's brother Cayden, five-star Nikolas Khamenia and four-star Sebastian Wilkins. Sarr was a late add to Duke's recruiting class after Cedric Coward elected to stay in the 2025 NBA Draft instead of transferring to Duke. Coward went on to become a lottery pick and has been one of the top rookies so far.Duke vs. Army prediction, picks Odds via FanDuel SportsbookDuke looked strong during the second half of its win over Texas last week. The Blue Devils should be able to cruise to a victory behind the play of Boozer, who looks like a legit candidate for National Player of the Year. Boozer's supporting cast (Isaiah Evans, Dame Sarr and Caleb Foster) is also strong. The Blue Devils cover the spread behind a big night from Boozer, who will record his second double-double of the season. Pick: Duke -30.5\nWho will win and cover in every college basketball game? Visit SportsLine to get picks from the model that simulates each game 10,000 times and is up more than $1,200 for $100 players on its top-rated spread picks the past six years.           \n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 offseason in Major League Baseball is fully underway, which means we're gradually ticking off the dates on our offseason calendar. That also means a steady supply of rumors, most of which center on free agency and trades (along with the occasional hiring and firing). Speaking of which, you can find Tuesday's supply just below. Tucker a possibility for Dodgers Will the top-rated free agent pair up with the top-rated team this offseason?\nKyle Tucker is available on the market, the Dodgers have a need at the outfielder corners, and they have the resources and competitive will to make it happen. As one of the best all-around players in baseball (when healthy), Tucker seems like an ideal fit in L.A. for 2026 and beyond. However, such a pairing is not to be assumed. The Dodgers have some impressive outfield prospects on the way, and as the Athletic reports they may be inclined to sign a veteran outfielder to a short-term deal to serve as a bridge to those incoming outfield prospects. Possibilities on that front include free agents Harrison Bader and Trent Grisham, or it's possible the Dodgers could revisit trade talks with the Guardians regarding Steven Kwan. Mets would \"love\" to re-sign Alonso, DíazBetween first baseman Pete Alonso and closer Edwin Díaz, the Mets could lose two of the top 15 players on the free-agent market. Yet New York's top baseball operations decision maker isn't ready to rule out a possible return.\n\"We love both Pete and Edwin. They've been great representatives of the organization,\" president of baseball operations David Stearns said Tuesday at the GM meetings. \"We'd love to have them both back. At this stage of the offseason, it's really tough to predict any outcomes, but certainly, we would love to have both those guys back.\"Of the pair, Díaz would seem more likely to re-up with the Mets. Alonso, conversely, was a late re-signing last spring and appears to again be a redundancy given the Mets already employ a surplus of corner infielders, including Mark Vientos, the most logical candidate to take over at the cold corner if and when Alonso departs. Contreras may stick with St. LouisThe Cardinals, in the midst of pivoting toward some level of mid- to long-term rebuild, are likely to explore trade opportunities for the veterans remaining on their roster. The wrinkle is that those three veterans -- third baseman Nolan Arenado, right-hander Sonny Gray, and first baseman/catcher Willson Contreras -- all have no-trade clauses. Arenado is certainly willing to waive his for the right fit and Gray has indicated a willingness to do the same, albeit for perhaps a narrower band of destinations. As for Contreras, he's repeatedly said he wants to remain in St. Louis as he heads into the third year of a five-year, $87.5 million pact. \nAt the end of the 2025 season, he reiterated those desires to new lead decision-maker Chaim Bloom, and the Belleville News-Democrat reports that Contreras still seems inclined to stick with St. Louis. Coming off another productive season, Contreras would probably have a market for his services, especially if he's willing to take on part-time catching duties, but for now he still seems like he wants to remain a Cardinal despite what seem like long odds of contention in 2026. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 NWSL postseason is off to an outrageous start. Playoff brackets are already busted after the 2025 NWSL Shield winners and first-place Kansas City Current were upset by eighth-place Gotham FC, and things will only get more chaotic as the final four teams prepare for the semifinal round. With just one more game to break through into the championship, players will step up and show out for their respective clubs. That means it's the perfect time for Attacking Third's NWSL Team of the Week:After weekly fixtures across the 2025 NWSL campaign, Attacking Third analysts selected a team of the week, head coach, and honorary captain based on performances across the weekend. Now we're keeping the hottest content trend of the year going into the playoffs. If you're keeping track of who has been on our past lineups, make sure to look back at our team selections from week 26.NWSL semifinal weekend gears up Saturday with Washington Spirit and Portland Thorns FC (Nov. 15, 12 p.m. ET on CBS, Paramount+), while 2024 NWSL champions Orlando Pride face 2023 NWSL champions Gotham FC on Sunday.CBS is the home of the NWSL Championship, and teams will compete for a spot in the final on Nov. 22. \nTake a look at our best XI:\nGoalkeeper: Aubrey Kingsbury (Washington Spirit)The Washington Spirit are back in the semifinal after a high drama penalty shootout. Goalkeeper Aubrey Kingsbury delivered a stone-cold performance in net. The veteran keeper made the goal look far too small for Racing Louisville, and after three failed conversions, Kingsbury and the Spirit are still on the path to the championship.\nDefender: Emily Sams (Orlando Pride)The Orlando Pride looked primed as ever to run it back after a quarterfinal win at home. They're doing it with plenty of dedication to team efforts in defensive shape. Defender Emily Sams was essential and led the team not just in touches (66) and pass attempts (50), but also led the charge on clearances with seven.Defender: Rebeca Bernal (Washington Spirit)The Washington Spirit have had to manage the majority of their season rotating players in and out due to a lengthy injury list. During the first half of the season, Rebeca Bernal was a crucial multi-positional player, often pugging in and out as centerback and defensive midfielder. She also sustained an injury late into the season, but now she's back and aiding the Spirit during the playoffs when more injuries are piling up on the backline. \nDefender: Emily Sonnett (Gotham FC)Perhaps Gotham FC's most consistent player, centerback Emily Sonnett provided plenty of coverage and the assist on Gotham's goal in regulation. She played all 120 minutes of the quarterfinal and was second on the squad in aerials (four), clearances (eight), and interceptions (four).  Her reliability and connectivity will be major attributes to the squad as they try to work back to another championship final. Defender: Rosemonde Kouassi (Washington Spirit)Having a bit of formational fun this week, we welcome Washington Spirit's Rosemonde Kouassi as a wingback. She's having another postseason where the Spirit is relying on her playmaking and creativity. She provided an assist on Gift Monday's goal, but isn't shy about taking her own chances on goal.\nMidfielder: Haley McCutcheon (Orlando Pride)Good teams figure out how to win, and elite players often lead the way. Haley McCutcheon embraces doing the quieter, complex work that goes unnoticed. But that's not the case out of quarterfinals; the defensive midfielder came up huge and scored the game-winning goal.\nMidfielder: Olivia Moultrie (Portland Thorns FC)If the Thorns midfielder Olivia Moultrie keeps up her form, she's gonna remain a threat for opposing defenses. Whether scoring on free kicks or setting up teammates, she's doing plenty to ensure Portland have a deep playoff run. \nMidfielder: Croix Bethune (Washington Spirit)Croix Bethune's sophomore season is just another reminder of how valuable she was even in her rookie season. The second-year player and 2024 NWSL Midfielder of the Year got back into the squad following injury, and her relentless efforts led the team in recoveries (nine), while her vision, playmaking flair, and backline movements will keep the Spirit as contenders moving forward. Forward: Katie Stengel (Gotham FC)To appreciate the NWSL is to know its lore, and Katie Stengel is among its most storied fables. A veteran journeywoman across leagues, perhaps no other player has done more for her teams in playoff moments than Stengel. Only one of two players to convert a penalty in the 2016 NWSL championship, scored the game-winner for Gotham FC in the 2023 NWSL semifinals, and now adds a game-winning goal during the 2025 NWSL quarterfinal.\nForward: Reilyn Turner (Portland Thorns FC)All the questions about the Portland Thorns heading into 2025 were about who was going to step up for the club in the absence of forwards with Sophia Wilson on maternity leave, Morgan Weaver out with injury, and the retirement of Christine Sinclair. Reilyn Turner was often the answer and was again during the quarterfinal round.\nForward: Jaedyn Shaw (Gotham FC)Sometimes it's about matching the right player with the right club at the right time, and there's no better example of that for Jaedyn Shaw and Gotham FC. She scored a momentum-shifting goal against first-place Kansas City, and that'll just be another attacking weapon for Gotham moving forward.\nCoach: Rob Gale (Portland Thorns FC)Finishing the season as a top-three team without your star striker and other injuries along the way? No problem for Rob Gale. Even first-year players are stepping up when needed. If he's hyped on the sidelines, then something's going right for Portland, and he'll be taking the energy all the way to Washington, D.C. now. \nHonorary captain: Luana (Orlando Pride)While Attacking Third panelists differed on who should be across the team of the week, there was no debate about the honorary captain. Pride midfielder Luana spent the 2024 season battling Hodgkin lymphoma, and won. The 2025 season has been about working back into form, and after Marta made an out-of-this-world 80-yard dash and drew a penalty during the quarterfinal, her Brazilian national teammate handed her the ball to put the game on ice. \"One year ago, I didn't even know if I would be playing again, and today I'm here. Nothing is impossible,\" Luana said after the game.\n            ",

Brown was on his way to Florida via transfer from a New Jersey jail this week after being extradited from Dubai to the United States to face trial earlier this month, according to the Miami Herald. Jail records in Essex County, New Jersey, show Brown was released Tuesday for transfer. Mark Eiglarsh, Brown's lawyer, acknowledged his client's not guilty plea in an email to the Associated Press. Brown is expected to be inside a South Florida courtroom for his bond hearing, according to Eiglarsh.Brown was involved in a May 16 altercation following a celebrity boxing event in Miami. Several videos from the incident circulated on social media, as well as pictures of Brown in handcuffs. Brown claimed police detained him, but released him that same night. \nBrown claims on social media that he was \"jumped by multiple individuals\" who tried to steal his jewelry, \"and cause physical harm to me.\" He even said that he would speak to attorneys about pressing charges on the individuals that allegedly assaulted him.However, one month later, a warrant obtained by The Washington Post stated that police received video footage showing Brown punching a man, and then appearing to take the gun of a security officer and run towards the individual. Two gunshots were then heard. The alleged victim in this case told investigators that a bullet possibly grazed his neck, and that he went to a local hospital to be treated. According to the warrant, patrons in the parking lot told police that Brown was the shooter.\nBrown, who turned 37 in July, last played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2021, and was a member of the Super Bowl LV team. Regarded as one of the best wide receivers of the 2010s, Brown earned First Team All-Pro status four times, and made seven Pro Bowls. Brown starred for the Pittsburgh Steelers from 2010-18, and led the league in receptions and receiving yards twice, and receiving touchdowns once.\n            \n    ",

Gabriel was initially ruled questionable to return but was then ruled out shortly thereafter.Sanders received a hero's welcome in Cleveland and immediately completed his first pass attempt, a 5-yard toss to Cedric Tillman. He also completed his second pass, a 7-yarder to David Njoku, but took a sack and fumbled (though a teammate recovered) on third down.\nHe also threw an interception on his second drive.\nA record-setting quarterback at Colorado, Sanders slipped all the way to the fifth round of the 2025 NFL Draft, where Cleveland selected him 144th overall. He was the sixth quarterback selected and the second selected by his own team; the Browns took Gabriel in the third round (94th overall).The Browns opened the season with Joe Flacco as their starter but traded him to the Bengals. Gabriel had started ever since.\nThe Browns led the Ravens 16-10 at halftime.\n            \n    ",

That was also Kelce's 100th career touchdown scored including his 17 postseason touchdowns, but records (unless stated otherwise) only take regular-season stats into account.\nKelce, who has spent his entire 13-year career with Kansas City, already held the franchise records for receptions, receiving yards and receiving touchdowns.

He has had at least three touchdown receptions all of his NFL seasons except his rookie year, and he scored 33 touchdowns from 2018-2020, his age-31 to age-33 seasons.

    "body": "\n        RALEIGH, N.C. -- On Sunday afternoon at a sold-out Reynolds Coliseum, No. 10 NC State lost to No. 17 TCU 69-59 in a game that shone a large spotlight on two programs that came into this season facing high expectations despite the major changes their rosters weathered this summer.The Wolfpack have no seniors on the team for the first time in school history after losing Aziaha James, Saniya Rivers and Madison Hayes to graduation, while the Horned Frogs have 10 new players and four new starters this season.NC State left the contest still searching for players who could fill the leadership gap and feeling frustrated with their offense after their three starting guards, Zamareya Jones, Zoe Brooks and Qadence Samuels, went a combined 4 of 28 from the field for just 14 points. TCU, meanwhile, impressed throughout the fast-paced, physical four quarters to notch its first nonconference road win against a ranked opponent in almost 15 years. Spanish forward Marta Suarez led the way with 26 points, while guard Olivia Miles -- one of the biggest transfer-portal prizes of the offseason -- added 15 points and 14 rebounds. \n\"This was a huge win on our journey together,\" head coach Mark Campbell said. \"And it takes moments like these and games like these for your team to grow.\"Here are a few things we learned from this early season clash.Marta Suarez is an absolute starThe 6-foot-3 Spanish forward spent the first two years of her college career with the Tennessee Volunteers before transferring to Cal for the next two seasons. At Tennessee, she mostly came off the bench and averaged less than 16 minutes a game. At Cal, she was a solid starter who averaged 12.4 points and 7.1 rebounds. But this season at TCU? She is averaging 17.5 points per game and looking like a bonafide star. Against NC State, Suarez had a lethal 26 points, going 10 of 18 from the floor and 4 of 8 from three. It seemed that every time the Wolfpack went on a run, she knocked down a three-pointer and silenced the crowd. \n\"I think it's just fun,\" Suarez said about playing in front of the raucous Reynolds crowd. \"That's what I play for. I love these moments. I love these games. I love on the road with the crowd against you, that will turn me up.\"She praised the \"intentionality\" of the coaches at TCU and said the way Campbell and his staff coach and recruit allows the players to \"be the best version of ourselves.\" Campbell said that while he didn't expect Suarez to have such a big personality -- \"an added bonus,\" he said -- he isn't surprised to see her flourishing on the court. Her talent popped out on film when he was recruiting.\n\"I saw one of the best playmaking forwards in college basketball from studying the film, her guard skills, her passing ability, her versatility. Nothing against anywhere she played before, she just hadn't yet been given the freedom to be used this way,\" he said. \"She's literally our dream stretch forward, because ultimately, she's a guard, a playmaking guard.\"The additions of Miles and 6-foot-7 center Clara Silva got the most attention during the summer, primarily because the graduations of Sedona Prince and Hailey Van Lith left TCU with a lot of questions about ball handling and rim protection. But Suarez is the type of versatile player who can take a team from being a dangerous floater to a true contender, and that's exactly what she's doing in Fort Worth.Olivia Miles is certain TCU is where she is supposed to beIn her four years at Notre Dame, Olivia Miles was a two-time second-team All-American and three-time first-team All-ACC player. After the Fighting Irish lost in March Madness last season, most expected Miles to either declare for the WNBA Draft -- where she was projected to be a lottery pick -- or stay in South Bend for one more season. She shocked the women's basketball world when she went into the transfer portal and landed at TCU. \nWhen asked by CBS Sports how she feels about her decision to go to TCU four games into the season, she was effusive with praise for the program.\"I feel fantastic. This is absolutely, 100%, ten toes down where I should be. I made the -- perfect isn't even the right word -- decision for me. And I need to grow. This game, I didn't play my best, but I have so much film and I have so much support around me to get me better and get more reps in. And that's just the energy at TCU. It's, 'How can we help you be better?' And that's literally exactly what I needed before I went pro,\" Miles said.\"I think when I was making that decision, I wasn't exactly in that position. I wasn't as confident in my game, and now I have a support system around me that can help me grow in all areas. And you know, I'm 4 for 18, but he still gives me the ball at the end of the game and trusts me to lead our team. And that's just something incredible. It almost makes me emotional to think about it.\"\nWith TCU, Miles has already accomplished something she never did with Notre Dame, despite more than three full seasons competing in the ACC: get a win at Reynolds Coliseum.NC State is still searching for energy and leadershipNC State head coach Wes Moore knew that it was a risk to make a nonconference schedule as tough as he did, but he wanted to see what his team was made of early in the season. After a season-opening 80-77 win over then-No. 8 Tennessee and a tight 69-68 loss to No. 18 USC, followed this week by a 66-47 win over Maine and this loss to TCU, the Wolfpack are sitting at 2-2 and feeling quite exposed.\"We've got a long way to go,\" Moore said. \"We've got to do a better job offensively. We're still doing too much one-on-one, not reversing the ball, not getting movement, and that's on me. Got to do a better job of trying to make sure we require that.\"\nSlow starts have plagued NC State in all four games this year and the team is having a hard time finding its fight when it gets down.\"I think energy is the biggest part we need right now,\" center Tilda Trygger, a bright spot in the TCU game with 15 points and 6 rebounds, said. \"Coach Moore talks about having energy both in and outside of practice. When shots aren't hitting, we need to do other things like rebounding and paint defense, and today we didn't do enough of that. Everything starts from energy.\"For his part, Moore didn't have any answers about where the energy was going to come from. \n\"It's been that way in practice, it's been that way in shootaround. You know, everything we do. We don't have a whole lot of energy people on the team,\" he said. \"I guess they're a little bit more solemn or sometimes laid back, and neither one of those are good. We gotta have some energy.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The first is always the hardest, and in his 243rd start, Adam Schenk can finally say that the hard part is over as he is officially a winner on the PGA Tour. Outlasting and outmaneuvering the field at a blustery Port Royal Golf Course, Schenk claimed the 2025 Bermuda Championship by one stroke over Chandler Phillips at 12 under.Schenk was forced to make a 5-foot par putt on the final hole to fend off Phillips and become the 16th first-time winner on the PGA Tour in 2025. Amid a week where he was striking some putts with one hand and backing off due to discomfort over his golf ball, Schenk summoned the fortitude to fight through the demons and into a new class.With his maiden victory, Schenk secures his playing privileges on the PGA Tour for the next two seasons. The 33-year-old entered the week at No. 134 in the FedEx Cup standings and in major jeopardy of losing his full-time status. He had missed 15 cuts this season, including eight in his last 14 starts, and was without a top-20 result since The CJ CUP Byron Nelson back in May.Instead, he will not only find himself in full-field events in 2026 but also tournaments such as the Players Championship, PGA Championship and RBC Heritage. He moves up to No. 67 in the FedEx Cup standings and could find his way into the first two signature events should he climb inside the top 60 by the end of next week's season finale at the RSM Classic.\n\"I started to play some better golf the last four months,\" Schenk said. \"I always had a little bit of the belief. I've really been working really hard. I have so many people to thank. I wish my family could be here. Of course, I win out of the country and my wife can't be here.\"Nothing was easy about Schenk's Sunday stroll in Bermuda, as tee times were moved up due to weather conditions. Forced to deal with wind gusts up to 40 mph, players struggled to flight proper golf shots and withstand what Mother Nature had planned.Not Schenk, however, who started his day in relatively mundane fashion by making one birdie and eight pars across his front nine. While scoring chances were rare, the overnight leader did well to keep himself out in front and avoid any mistakes that would prove costly.\nUp ahead on the golf course, Alex Smalley and others made charges to apply pressure on the leader. Smalley got as deep as 11 under but needed three putts from approximately 15 feet on the last and dropped to 10 under for the tournament. Meanwhile, Frankie Capan III reached that same 12-under number before dropping shots on the par-3 16th and par-5 17th to settle for a tie for third.Schenk had opportunities to make things more comfortable down the stretch, but his putter had other ideas. Playing the par-5 17th to perfection thanks to a couple of stingers that barely got off the ground, Schenk missed a close-range birdie look that would have given him a two-stroke lead up the 72nd hole.\nWhen Phillips made par and Schenk's playing partner, Takumi Kanaya, missed the 18th green in regulation, he knew all he needed was one last par to break through. However, as fate would have it, it would not be without one last 5-foot tickler, and unlike the previous hole, Schenk stepped up and stroked beauty, exorcising his demons and becoming a PGA Tour winner all in one fell swoop.\n\"I knew I could win; it was just a matter of executing each shot and handling each situation I put myself in,\" Schenk said. \"I can't believe it's over. It seemed like the longest day ever.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Dallas Mavericks announced Sunday afternoon that Anthony Davis will remained sidelined for at least the next 7-10 days. Davis has missed the last eight games with a calf strain, and despite making \"good progress\" per the Mavericks' press release, his re-evaluation suggested that he should remain out for the next week and a half.This is a surprising turn of events, only because there was consideration for Davis to return for the Mavericks' Nov. 8 loss to the Washington Wizards. Davis reportedly wanted to return for that game, but the Mavericks have continued to hold him out as he continues to rehab from the calf strain he sustained in Dallas' win against the Indiana Pacers on Oct. 29th. The push for Davis, 32, to return during that game against the Wizards also came from former Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison, who was fired on Nov. 11. Harrison reportedly \"urged\" Davis to return, per The Athletic. However, the team's medical staff \"forbade\" it, as there was concern Davis could tear his Achilles. The day after Harrison was dismissed, it was reported that Mavericks governor Patrick Dumont requested medical data indicating Davis wasn't at risk to worsen his his calf strain before the team allows him to return.With Harrison no longer in charge, it seems as though the Mavericks plan to take the cautious approach with Davis, which is the smartest path forward. Given Davis' injury history, its best not to rush this, especially a calf strain. We just saw in the playoffs last season how a calf strain can go from bad to worse, as Tyrese Haliburton's turned into a torn Achilles that will force him to miss this entire season.\nSuch an injury would spell disaster for the Mavericks if that were to happen to Davis, primarily because with Harrison out of the picture, the path forward may be to trade Davis and fully rebuild around rookie Cooper Flagg. If Davis were to worsen his injury, that would tank his trade value and put the Mavericks in an even more precarious situation.For Davis, as much as he may want to play right now, it makes the most sense for him to heal completely before returning to the lineup. It's better to miss a handful of games and return fully healthy, then come back too soon and re-aggravate the injury or make it worse.While it's the smart path forward, it's certainly not a great situation for anyone involved. Davis has played in just 14 games for the Mavericks since being traded to Dallas in February as part of the deal that sent Luka Dončić to the Los Angeles Lakers. On top of Davis having to deal with living in the doom and gloom of Mavericks' fans wishing they still had Dončić, he also hasn't been healthy, which makes matters worse. Meanwhile, Dončić has the Lakers out to a 10-4 start, while averaging 34.4 points, nine assists and nine rebounds.\nWe'll see if Davis manages to return after this new timeline the Mavericks have announced. If he doesn't, then it will suggest that this calf strain was far more serious than Dallas, Davis and Harrison had initially believed it to be. \n            ",

Ian Fuller's men took a great finish from Nicola Rosamilia in the fourth minute and wouldn't look back from there, shepherding Spokane shots into areas that were easy for their stout defense to deal with. It was quite a finish from Rosamilia, but winger Stavros Zarokostas made the goal happen. Latching on to a ball over the top, he went on a mazy run through the Spokane defense before cutting it back for Rosamilia to have an easy finish. It's only the third goal of the season and the first since July for Rosamilia, but in a championship, you need contributions up and down the roster, which Knoxville got.\nKempes Tekiela added an insurance goal from the penalty spot to put the match out of reach, while defender of the year Jordan Skelton and the backline kept Spokane at bay. During the lead-up to the match, Fuller spoke about how much the community means to the team, and it's an impressive feat for him to bring them a title in only his first season as a head coach. Fuller has gotten the team to play in his image, and they were rewarded with an impressive title victory over a Spokane side that have made it back-to-back League One finals. Knoxville also did it in front of a league-record crowd of 7,500 fans, showing just how many people are tuning into what the club is building. \nTo topple Spokane, it took a prepared side who were up for the challenge. With this kind of progression in only his first year as a head coach, the future is bright for him and Knoxville. Another final loss will sting for Spokane, but they'll also be back for this stage as manager Leigh Veidman has been able to turn this side into consistent contenders, but for Sunday, it's time to party in Knoxville.\n            \n    ",

The USWNT player was traded to the club late in September, and her late arrival is clearly paying off in the playoffs. \"I mean, this team is so gritty. This team fights to the very end. This team plays for each other, and it's contagious,\" Shaw said after the game. \"I love this team so much, and I would literally do anything on the field to get the points at the end of the day. I'm just so happy to be going to the finals.\"Shaw scored the opening goal during the quarterfinal against Kansas City Current, NWSL Shield winners and the first-place team, and can now add a game-winning semifinal free-kick goal. Take a look at this strike:\n\"I mean, I just knew I prepared myself for that moment. I have been working tirelessly on my free kicks since I got here, and I think the staff has done a really good job making me feel really confident in taking those,\" Shaw said. \"Me and Rose [Lavelle] just waited to see, like, what the picture was gonna look like, to see who was gonna take it. And ultimately, I live for these moments, and I'm just really happy that I could make an impact for our team. I love this team so much. I'm just really happy to have whatever I do on the practice field come out into these big moments.\"The stoppage time winner extends a storybook postseason for the eighth-place side, who have now upset the top-seeded Kansas City, and Orlando. Gotham FC are just two years removed from winning the NWSL Championship. The club lifted the trophy in 2023, and now they have an opportunity to cement their elite status with another in just a short turnaround. Now they have an extra clutch performer in Shaw. \n\"Credit to the staff, all my teammates, I think, like I said before, they made me feel so comfortable in this environment, and they really pushed me to be the best version of myself, and vice versa. And ultimately, I think the biggest realization for me is just like, I know that God has placed me here for a reason. I know that this is exactly where I'm supposed to be,\" she said.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        NFC teams vying for the top seed in the conference meet when the Detroit Lions take on the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 11 'Sunday Night Football' at 8:20 p.m. ET from Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia. The Lions (6-3) lead the NFC North, while the Eagles (7-2) have a 3.5-game bulge in the  NFC East standings over the Dallas Cowboys. The game will feature Lions quarterback Jared Goff against Eagles signal caller Jalen Hurts. Both players figure into several NFL player props or a Sunday Night Football SGP. Detroit tight end, Sam LaPorta (back), is out as he was recently placed on injured reserve.Goff has played at a high level all season, completing 74% of his passes for 2,235 yards and 20 touchdowns. Hurts, meanwhile, has been equally as impressive. In nine games, he has completed 68.9% of his passes for 1,860 yards and 16 touchdowns. There are several NFL player props one could target for these stars, or you may find value in seeking NFL prop lines for other options like Jahmyr Gibbs, Amon-Ra St. Brown or David Montgomery of the Lions or Saquon Barkley, DeVonta Smith or A.J.

    "body": "\n        In Week 11, several players jumped on the Fantasy Football radar. This could be the start of something special for some of these players, and you'll want to get well ahead of your Week 12 Fantasy Football waiver wire by putting these players on your radar. For more on every player we discuss below, you'll want to make sure to check out Jamey Eisenberg's in-depth waiver wire column on Monday afternoon.Sean Tucker, RB, BuccaneersTucker has flashed with the Buccaneers during his short career in Tampa but he has been buried on the depth chart behind Bucky Irving and Rachaad White. With Irving still unable to suit up on gameday, Tucker has taken a considerably larger role in the backfield. In Week 11, Tucker broke out with 106 rushing yards on 19 carries. He had two rushing touchdowns including a long 40-plus explosive touchdown run. Tucker also added two receptions for 34 yards and caught a touchdown. A three touchdown performance should lock in some kind of role even once Irving returns to the lineup. However, for as long as Irving is out, it's clear the Buccaneers have turned to Tucker as their lead back over White. In an offense this potent -- one of Fantasy's highest scoring and most consistent -- that's a valuable every-week Fantasy starter. Once Irving comes back, he'll be relegated to a desperation FLEX. Enjoy it while it lasts.Michael Wilson, WR, CardinalsWith Marvin Harrison ruled out for Week 11, Wilson was expected to take over as the defacto first read in the passing game. No one could've expected these kind of numbers, however. Wilson went off for a career-high 170 receiving yards on 13 receptions. He was targeted a whopping 15 times. Now let's establish the context. The Cardinals were trailing in this game by multiple scores for almost the entire game. They were throwing early and often. Not every game will feature this kind of volume for Wilson, but it's clear Arizona is a more consistent dropback passing team when Jacoby Brissett is at quarterback. The expectation is that Harrison may miss another week after undergoing surgery for appendicitis. This is not guaranteed. For as long as Harrison is out, Wilson should serve as a locked-in WR2 with obvious weekly upside. Tyrell Shavers, WR, BillsKeon Coleman was made a surprise healthy inactive by the Bills for Week 11. Later, we found out this was due to disciplinary reasons. Coleman's role in the offense moving forward remains uncertain, but his absence allowed for Shavers to break out in week 11. Shavers caught four passes for 90 yards and a touchdown on five targets in a wild shootout. His production moving forward should be hard to predict and uncertain. He is best left on waiver wires. Emanuel Wilson, RB, Packers Wilson was less of a breakout and more of an immediate waiver wire alert after Josh Jacobs got injured during Green Bay's Week 11 win over the Giants. Jacobs got hurt early, tried to return and then left the game for good. Wilson finished with 11 carries for 40 yards and a rushing touchdown. He also added a reception for nine yards on his lone target. More importantly, Wilson operated in a workhorse role once Jacobs left the game. If Jacobs is forced to miss any time, Wilson could immediately operated as a borderline RB1 in Fantasy lineups. \nIsaiah Hodgins, WR, Giants Fans of the Giants are left pondering why this move didn't happen sooner, but Hodgins immediately resumed his role as the lead possession receiver for New York in Week 12 with Darius Slayton sidelined. Hodgins had a run with the Giants back in 2022 and knows the offensive system inside out. He immediately operated in a starter role. If Slayton is forced to miss more time, Hodgins could operated as a back-end WR3/FLEX.Bhayshul Tuten, RB, JaguarsTuten finally cashed in on his rookie promise with a big Week 11. Tuten racked up 74 rushing yards on 15 carries and scored a touchdown in the red zone. More importantly, he operated as a 1B to Travis Etienne's 1A in the Jaguars backfield. Tuten could have some back-end RB2 upside running behind a rush scheme that has found success under head coach Liam Coen.Xavier Legette, WR, Panthers Legette continues to operate as Bryce Young's donwfield threat with four receptions for 83 yards and a highlight-reel touchdown. What's more important is that he racked up eight targets in this game. Legette's volume and TD upside make him a back-end WR3 option. \nDevin Singletary, RB, Giants Singletary is operating as the 1B in the Giants backfield but for Fantasy Football purposes he might as well be the 1A. Singletary is the preferred option in the red zone and he is cashing in on his red zone opportunities. Singletary scored two touchdowns in Week 11 for the Giants in addition to 47 total yards. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Long before the final putt of the 2025 DP World Tour Championship fell, Rory McIlroy had his hands on his seventh Race to Dubai title. Securing his fourth straight season-long crown in Europe to pull him second all-time behind only Colin Montgomerie (eight), the Northern Irishman nearly added even more hardware to his trophy case by pulling off a double and winning the European circuit's season finale alongside the year-long race.Instead, McIlroy -- despite an eagle on the 72nd hole -- fell on the first playoff hole to Matt Fitzpatrick, his Ryder Cup teammate and fellow European. The Englishman carded dueling 66s over the weekend to traverse his way through the peloton by tournament's end and finish his 72 holes at 18 under. A par on the first extra hole, the par-5 18th, was all Fitzpatrick needed to fend off McIlroy and secure his third DP World Tour Championship title.\"It means the world,\" said Fitzpatrick of his victory. \"Struggled at the start of this year, obviously, and to turn it around in the summer like I did and have a Ryder Cup like I did, Ryder Cup in particular, [I] feel like it's hard to top given everything. But the way that I played today, I feel like I really didn't hit one bad shot all day. I'm so proud of myself, the effort that everyone puts in behind the scenes. What a feeling.\"McIlroy appeared to have the tournament under control, walking off the par-4 11th as he possessed a two-stroke lead with seven holes to play. Getting as deep as 5 under in his round at that stage, the 36-year-old only then began to take on water, adding squares to his scorecard on Nos. 12 and 16 to fall off the pace.\nUp ahead, Fitzpatrick continued to scratch and claw, reminiscent of his year as a whole. A hefty diet of pars in the middle of his round preceded a flurry of a finish as Fitzpatrick rolled in respective birdie efforts from 9 feet and 25 feet on Nos. 14 and 15 to propel himself towards the top of a crowded leaderboard that featured the likes of Tommy Fleetwood, Ludvig Åberg and Laurie Canter.When those three men could do no better than 17 under, Fitzpatrick found himself in a position to seize the moment on the final hole. Getting up and down from right of the green, he posted 18 under as McIlroy watched from the right side of the fairway with 5 wood in hand and eagle on his mind.McIlroy feathered his 5 wood to perfection to set up a look for eagle. After getting a teach from his playing partner, Rasmus Neergard-Petersen, McIlroy marched to his putt and marched to the hole to pick up his ball from the bottom as he once again found his best at the precise right time.\n\"Of course you [think he'll make it],\" Fitzpatrick said. \"He's probably one of the only few that you know you go to a playoff, two clear and one to play, and you know you're going to a playoff. In typical Rory fashion, he did it again, and obviously, you never like to see the way it ends. But obviously delighted.\"While it may not have gone the way of McIlroy in the playoff, he does now inch closer to even more golf immortality. With seven Race to Dubai titles under his belt, the grand slam champion -- who now has an award named after him -- moves past European legend Seve Ballesteros' six titles and directly into the rearview mirror of Montgomerie. \"I said this on this green last year, [Seve] means so much to this tour and to the European Ryder Cup team,\" McIlroy said. \"We rally so much around his spirit and his quotes and everything he meant for European golf. To equal him last year was cool, but to surpass him this year, yeah, I didn't get this far in my dreams. So, it's very cool.\"\nMontgomerie's record number of eight included a streak of seven straight from 1999 to 2005. McIlroy finds himself amid a heater of his own, donning four crowns in a row dating back to 2022. He appears intent on giving it a go as he shows no signs of slowing down in the late 30s of his career.\"I want it, of course I do,\" McIlroy said. \"I caught up with [Montgomerie] this week when he was here a couple days ago, and I saw him. Look, it seems within touching distance now. I'd love to be the winningest European in terms of Order of Merits and season-long races. You know, I've probably got a few more good years left in me, and hopefully I can catch him and surpass him.\"\n            ",

However, Josh Allen ended up clinching the scorigami when he scored on a nine-yard touchdown run with just 2:35 left to play to push the score to 44-32, which officially gave us the 1,095th unique final score in NFL history. \nThe score by Allen capped off an MVP-level performance by the Bills quarterback, who totaled SIX touchdowns in the game. Not only did he have three rushing touchdowns, but he also added three passing touchdowns, marking just the second time in NFL history that a QB has scored three rushing touchdowns and three passing touchdowns in a game. (Allen has the only other performance, and that came in 2024 against the Rams.) Allen totaled 357 yards with 317 of that coming through the air. To get a scorigami, you need a few crazy things to happen -- and this game certainly had those. There were NINE lead changes, which is tied for the second-most in a game in NFL history. One of those lead changes came after Sean Tucker scored on a six-yard run in the third quarter for the Buccaneers to put Tampa Bay up 26-21. At that point, the Bucs decided to go for two and didn't get it, which set the stage for the wonky final score. \nThis marks the second straight week that an NFL game has ended with a scorigami. In Week 10, the Texans beat the Jaguars 36-29 to give us the 1094th different final score in league history. This was the fourth scorigami of the 2025 season and the second by the Bills. Buffalo was also involved in a scorigami back in Week 1 when it beat the Baltimore Ravens, 41-40. As for the Buccaneers, this marked the first time they've been involved in a scorigami in two years. That last time it happened came in a 39-37 loss to the Texans back in November 2023. \nAlthough the Bills' win was the only scorigami of Week 11, there have been some rare final scores. The Pittsburgh Steelers' 34-12 win over the Cincinnati Bengals marked the first time in 13 years that a game has ended with that score. The Jaguars' 35-6 win over the Chargers was also a rarity. That score had not happened in the NFL since 2015 before Jacksonville's win. \n            ",

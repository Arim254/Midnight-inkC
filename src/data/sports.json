The newspaper claimed athletes were putting the acid into their penises for enhancement.In ski jumping events, suit size -- in this case, larger -- is considered advantageous. \"I am not aware of the details of ski jumping, and how that could improve performance,\" WADA director general Olivier Niggli said at a press conference this week. \"If anything was to come to the surface, we would look at it and see if it is doping related. We don't address other [non-doping] means of enhancing performance.\"Suits must conform to an athlete's body and are fitted before the start of every jumping season.\n\"Every extra centimeter on a suit counts,\" Sandro Pertile, race director for the International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS), said in 2024. \"If your suit has a 5% bigger surface area, you fly further.\"Last August, two Olympic gold medalist ski jumpers and three staffers on the Norway men's team were charged with ethics violations after \"equipment manipulation\" following an investigation stemming from a March incident. The Norway team were reportedly caught on video adding stitching into the crotch area of their suits to make them bigger and thus, more aerodynamic during competition.Per the BBC, Norway coach Magnus Brevik and equipment manager Adrian Livelten admitted the suits were altered prior to the team's participation in the large hill event.\n\"We regret it like dogs, and I'm terribly sorry that this happened,\" Brevik said.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\nFrom NFL player props like Kenneth Walker anytime touchdown (-195) to Patriots vs. Seahawks (-4.5) picks against the spread, to over/under picks (45.5), to money-line picks (Seahawks -231, Patriots +191), your 2026 Super Bowl parlay can go in a number of different directions. Another option is guessing the margin of victory of the game, and there's an NFL betting trend that could help in that regard. Entering Super Bowl LX, three of the last four editions of The Big Game have been decided by exactly 3 points. So, you could back the game's winning margin to be exactly 3 points in a 2026 Super Bowl SGP, which would return +475.Seattle winning by 3 points has +950 NFL prop odds, while New England doing the same carries +1100 odds. You could also make NFL bets on winning bands, such as the Seahawks prevailing by 1-6 points (+275) or New England winning by 1-6 points at +300. But if you want to increase your potential winnings exponentially, then you could string one of these wagers with others into a lucrative Super Bowl same-game parlay. Before making any Super Bowl 60 picks and NFL parlays, you need to see the epic Super Bowl LX same game parlay from SportsLine's proven model that pays out $15,000 on just a $10 bet.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters the 2026 Super Bowl on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now that the simulation model has had a chance to digest the Super Bowl 60 NFL odds, it's locked in its betting picks to form a longshot NFL parlay that could pay out $15,000 for a $10 bettor. You can only see the picks and full parlay by heading to SportsLine.\nTop 2026 Super Bowl parlay picksFor Super Bowl LX, one of the picks featured in the longshot parlay is Patriots receiver Kayshon Boutte as an anytime TD scorer (+310). Despite ranking 68th amongst wideouts in catches (33) in the regular season, Boutte was 18th in positional receiving touchdowns (6). He added another score in the Divisional Round and then got a redzone target in the AFC Title Game. While Seattle has an elite defense, through the air is where to exploit that unit. Eight of the last 10 touchdowns the Seahawks have allowed have been via the pass, including all three they gave up in the NFC Title Game.Boutte has more touchdowns this season than the Pats leading receiver, Stefon Diggs, despite the latter having twice as many targets and receptions. The model projects Boutte to score 0.31 touchdowns, which is the highest amongst all Patriots and brings great value to these plus-money odds as one leg of a Super Bowl SGP. See the rest of the picks in the Super Bowl LX same game parlay here, and you can bet Boutte as an anytime TD scorer using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nHow to make NFL parlay picks for a payout of $15,000The parlay also includes three additional Super Bowl picks from SportsLine's NFL model, including a must-see first NFL touchdown-scorer prop that pays out 25-1. You can only see the Seahawks vs. Patriots picks and the full parlay at SportsLine.What are the top NFL picks for Super Bowl LX that can be combined into an NFL SGP that returns $15,000 on just a $10 bet, and which optimal first touchdown scorer prop pays out 25-1?

    "body": "\n        Just three days ago, it didn't seem like the Los Angeles Clippers were going to do much of anything at the trade deadline. They'd won 17 of their previous 21 games, the NBA's best record during that stretch, to totally turn around their season after a 6-21 start. If they were going to make any moves, they profiled as buyers as they climbed to ninth in the West with Kawhi Leonard playing at an MVP level. \"In our situation, I don't see much movement,\" coach Tyronn Lue had recently told reporters.That quote is now hilarious. Before Thursday's deadline, the Clippers traded their second- and third-best players. The front office completely reoriented the franchise, prioritizing the future over the remainder of this season. They were the kind of moves you'd expect from the most disappointing team in the league, not the hottest one. They were also two of the best trades that any team made at the deadline.I find every part of this strange, as I liked seeing Los Angeles turn into the type of team I thought it would be coming into the season. From that vantage point, it's a bit of a bummer to watch the organization pivot away from what was working. There is no way, though, that I can argue with what the Clippers did from a team-building perspective. They didn't just turn James Harden into an All-Star-caliber guard 10 years his junior; they convinced the Cleveland Cavaliers to send them a second-round pick for their trouble. And they didn't just turn Ivica Zubac into multiple picks in a deal with the Indiana Pacers; they turned him into a pair of good firsts, one of which is particularly interesting.\n        \n            \n                James Harden's early-exit legacy is likely cemented, but that doesn't make it any less complicated\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLet's start with the Harden trade. Unless Garland has the most persistent case of turf toe in history, the Clippers will look brilliant for buying low on him. Just last season, Garland had the best year of his career, averaging 20.6 points on 60% true shooting as an integral part of the league's top offense. After two-plus years of Harden running the show, it will be jarring to see this team with a lead guard who is active and dangerous off the ball. \nGiven concerns about durability -- he's played in only 26 games this season and has been out since mid-January, but told reporters in LA that he's \"ready to hoop\" -- and the defensive viability of a Garland-Donovan Mitchell backcourt, it's understandable that the Cavaliers, firmly in win-now mode (and convince-Mitchell-to-sign-an-extension mode) wanted to swap him for Harden. For a Clippers team that was ancient and light on draft capital, though, this was a no-brainer. They sidestepped extension discussions with a star who turns 37 in August and replaced him with a 26-year-old who will be a core player going forward.I am curious to see if the Clippers, who rank 30th in offensive pace, speed things up with Garland. The biggest question coming out of the deadline, though, is what will happen with the protected pick they received in the Zubac deal. The particulars are fascinating. In a throwback to the 2012 trade that sent Kyle Lowry from the Houston Rockets to the Toronto Raptors, the Pacers agreed to send Los Angeles their pick in this year's loaded draft with double protection, so it stays in Indiana if it falls between No. 1 and No. 4 or if it's No. 10 onward.This is a hell of a risk for the Pacers. If the lottery lands them between No. 5 and No. 9, they'll have to send the draft pick that was supposed to be their reward for a \"gap year\" to Los Angeles. And if doesn't, then the outcome isn't necessarily bad for Los Angeles: It will immediately turn into to an unprotected 2031 first-round pick. (There are, obviously, a wide range of outcomes. If Indiana wins the lottery and pairs Kansas star Darryn Peterson with Tyrese Haliburton, I'd bet against them sending the Clippers an awesome pick in 2031.) At the moment, the Pacers have the NBA's third-worst record; if that holds, Los Angeles will have a 47.9% chance of getting the pick, per Tankathon.\n\n        \n            \n                Ivica Zubac trade grades: Winner of Pacers, Clippers deal will be decided on lottery night\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nZubac, 28, is an excellent player and an incredible development story. The Clippers stole him from the Los Angeles Lakers at the 2019 deadline, and since then he's improved as a rim protector, a post-up threat, a passer and a finisher. He earned a spot on the All-Defensive Second Team last year, and he'll feast as a roll man next to Halliburton next season. That said, one could make the case that the aforementioned pick alone would be worth giving him up. In addition, the Clippers got Indiana's unprotected (!) 2029 pick, plus wing Bennedict Mathurin and big man Isaiah Jackson. (They also sent wing Kobe Brown to the Pacers.)Mathurin was a popular Most Improved Player candidate coming into the season, but, in the last year of his rookie contract, he failed to convince the Pacers that they needed to keep him around. He has upped his 3-point rate, though, and is averaging 17.5 points on 58.6% true shooting, both career highs. The former No. 6 pick is still just 23 years old and a talented bucket-getter, and the Clippers will get to spend some time with him before deciding how they want to approach his restricted free agency. They did Indiana a favor by taking on Jackson's contract, which doesn't expire until 2028, but he at least gives them another big body with Zubac walking out the door.Like all trades involving picks, young players and injury concerns, there are a lot of variables here, and the protected Pacers pick is an unusually wild one. We don't need the benefit of hindsight, though, to know that, value-wise, the Clippers crushed this deadline. Until now, they were at the end of an era that began with the arrival of Leonard and Paul George in 2019, trying to make the best of the situation without sacrificing flexibility. Now they've started to build something new.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NBA trade deadline has passed, and while we didn't get the massive move everyone was expecting, which was Giannis Antetokounmpo getting dealt, there was a flurry of other deals that did surprise us. Ivica Zubac heading to the Indiana Pacers is certainly up there. So too is the Dallas Mavericks dealing Anthony Davis to the Wizards for an underwhelming return.But with the trade deadline sorted, the next order of business is assessing the buyout market and seeing which players who were traded could be headed to a new team once more. There were a handful of players who we expect to get waived or bought out, which will allow them to sign to a different team better suited to their needs. So let's take a look around and see which buyout market players could become hot commodities around the league.Khris MiddletonIt's unclear if the Mavericks intend to buy out Middleton's contract, but given they're focusing on the lottery and Cooper Flagg's development, it doesn't make much sense for them to hold onto the veteran wing, who could certainly help a contending team for the rest of the season. Marc Stein reports that the Mavericks may keep him and Marvin Bagley III for the rest of the season, but that could change.\nSo let's assume that the Mavericks do cut ties with Middleton, there's surely a few teams willing to take a chance on the 34-year-old forward. His numbers don't inspire confidence that he can still give you meaningful minutes, as he was averaging just 10.3 points in 24 minutes on an awful Wizards team. But whichever team takes him on can feel a bit better if it doesn't work out because they won't be paying him the $33 million he's owed for the rest of the season. If the Mavericks bought him out, he'd sign a significantly cheaper deal if it meant he gets to play on a contender again.Despite the career-low numbers and age, Middleton is still a solid two-way player who perhaps just needs a change in scenery from the back-to-back losing seasons in D.C. Mike ConleyConley was traded to the Bulls, then promptly traded to the Hornets. He was then waived by Charlotte, which allows him to sign anywhere in the league. And because he was traded a second time, Conley could even return to the Timberwolves if he wanted, and given Anthony Edwards' words after Minnesota's 128-126 win over the Raptors Wednesday night, it may already be a forgone conclusion that Conley will just re-sign with the Wolves.\n\"Mike's my guy, he's like an OG to me,\" Edwards said after the win. \"Hopefully we can get him back. I don't really know how it goes, but I keep hearing he can come back, so hopefully he will and hopefully he sees this. We want you back Mike. He knows we miss him.\"The Timberwolves traded Conley for cash considerations, giving them some tax relief. Now, though, after also adding Ayo Dosunmu at the trade deadline, the Wolves could also try to re-sign Conley if he wants to return. Don't let Conley's age (38) fool you, he may not be putting up the numbers as he did in his prime, but his locker room presence and leadership are just as important for that Timberwolves team. Edwards' public remarks on him only echoed that. At this point, it would be surprising to see him sign anywhere else.Chris PaulWhat a wild eight months it's been for Paul. He re-signed with the Clippers in the summer, bringing a full circle moment to one of the franchise's greatest players. He then announced this would be his final year, as he would retire at season's end. Just a few weeks after that, he was sent home by the Clippers in early December, with the intention of the team eventually trading him. He was finally traded to the Toronto Raptors, but it's expected that the team will waive him.\nIt's been a sad conclusion to what's been an otherwise Hall of Fame career for Paul. And it's no guarantee that he'll actually land on a team. That would be an even more depressing reality, but the truth is he's 40 years old and averaged three points in 16 games for the Clippers this season. He did start all 82 games for the Spurs last year, so perhaps a team takes a chance on someone who could certainly help a young, developing team. But finding him a spot on a championship-contending team is difficult. It would be the perfect ending if Paul were able to land on a title contender with a real shot at winning a ring. Cam ThomasThomas was waived by the Nets at the deadline, which is pretty stunning given he took the qualifying offer this past summer in an effort to bet on himself to earn a bigger payday. But that hasn't exactly worked out this season. He may be averaging just under 16 points a season, but Thomas is also shooting under 40% from the floor. It's a hard sell to any team willing to take on an inefficient, high-usage guard who hasn't shown an ability to impact winning.Still, though, it's hard to ignore Thomas' offensive talent. In the right situation he could be a great sixth man off the bench for a contending team. He's already pitching himself to other teams after being waived by Brooklyn, telling ESPN's Marc Spears, \"Super excited ready to actually help and contribute to another team. My next team is getting elite scoring, good playmaking and a good combo guard.\"\nWherever Thomas lands, he'll need to use the last 30-something games of the season proving he's worthy of a more lucrative deal. The Nets once offered him a two-year, $30 million deal, which he turned down in hopes of landing a bigger payday. Now will be the time to prove to Brooklyn that he was worth what they were offering him.Lonzo BallIt really felt like Ball would catch on in Cleveland, but even while remaining relatively healthy he wasn't able to turn back the clock to where he was pre-injury with the Bulls. He's lost a step athletically, and his efficiency has completely fallen off a cliff. It's a shame because five years ago, Ball was looking like an All-Star and the Bulls appeared to be fully back as they climbed as high as the No. 1 spot in the East.But, two-and-a-half missed seasons filled with surgeries later, Ball has looked like a shell of himself in Cleveland. As a result, he was traded to the Jazz where he's expected to be waived. The Cavaliers had to attach two second-round picks to move Ball, which speaks to how poor he's looked. However, there could be a team willing to take the low risk of signing him for the rest of the season.\nWhen Ball's at his best, he's a lockdown perimeter defender, capable of getting your team out in transition with deflections and steals. On offense, while this year doesn't show it, Ball really became a threat from 3-point range and is someone who can get an offense organized as high-level facilitator. It's never a bad idea to take a flyer on a player with Ball's skillset, and given the lackluster crowd of buyout candidates, a contending team will certainly swoop him up for a low cost.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Last offseason, the Indiana Pacers stunningly lost Myles Turner to the Milwaukee Bucks in free agency after their surprising trip to the NBA Finals. That left the Pacers without a big man moving forward. Now, Indiana may have actually improved at the center spot, landing All-Defensive Team center Ivica Zubac from the Los Angeles Clippers.The cost of getting that center was significant. Indiana will send Los Angeles former No. 6 pick Bennedict Mathurin, Isaiah Jackson, and two first-round picks. One of those picks, an unprotected 2029 selection from Indiana, is unremarkable. The second is one of the more interesting draft picks ever traded. It is Indiana's 2026 first-round pick, but it has multiple protections. If the pick lands between No. 1 and No. 4, or No. 10 and No. 30 this spring, the Pacers keep it and send the Clippers their unprotected 2031 pick. If it lands between No. 5 and No. 9 in this May's lottery, however, it goes to the Clippers and the Pacers keep their 2031 selection.So, what should we make of this unconventional deal? Let's grade it to find out.Indiana Pacers: BWhen Turner was a free agent last offseason, the Pacers could have used Bird Rights to re-sign him to anything up to the max. When they were in the middle of the NBA Finals, they appeared poised to go into the tax to keep him. Once Tyrese Haliburton tore his Achilles and Indiana's 2025-26 hopes were dashed, however, the Pacers took a longer view. Turner was in his late 20s. His defense had started to slip. And Milwaukee ultimately elected to pay him at the top of the market: $108 million over four years that will take him through his age-32 season.Zubac is, in many ways, Turner's opposite in those respects. He's only gotten better as he's aged, making an All-Defensive Team and mounting a late push for All-NBA last year, in his age-27 season. He will make around $11 million less over the next two seasons than Turner will, and he's only locked in through his age-30 season. \nAt this point, he's a better player than Turner was last season, though he's stylistically quite different. Indiana will have to adjust to having a center that does not shoot 3s, as that spacing meant a good deal to their offense. Zubac isn't an obvious fit in Indiana's up-tempo system either having spent most of his career playing for the slow, plodding Clippers. His stellar passing and screening, however, should fit like a glove in Rick Carlisle's free-wheeling offense, and his excellent floater is a great end-of-clock release valve for an offense that doesn't have a typical one-on-one shotmaker. \nThe biggest difference here, though, is his rebounding. Turner has never provided much of anything on the glass. The Pacers ranked 28th in the NBA in rebounding rate last season, and while they survived by rebounding as a team in the playoffs, this group has never really had a high-end individual rebounder. That's going to make a real difference, especially on offense as the NBA has embraced the offensive glass more than ever this season.Giving up Mathurin was a necessary evil. He was headed for restricted free agency over the summer, and the Pacers weren't going to have the dollars or shots he'd want next season. The real value proposition of this trade comes down to that enormously unconventional draft pick they traded in 2026. If the picks land in 2029 and 2031, while it deprives Indiana of trade ammunition, they shouldn't worry too much about giving away great selections. Prior to this season, Indiana had missed the playoffs just nine times since 1990. The Pacers are almost never bad. They shouldn't expect to be in 2029 and 2031--especially if they're adding a top-four pick in 2026.\nBut that's a double-edged sword. Never being bad means never having upside in the lottery. This 2026 draft—loaded not just at the top, but throughout the lottery -- represented what might have been a once-in-an-era opportunity to get a top prospect on a cost-controlled rookie deal while Tyrese Haliburton is still in his prime. It obviously still could. If this pick lands in the top four and the Pacers get a potential superstar, they win this trade running away. If they give up a pick between No. 5 and No. 9? Well, that's a bit more complicated. Still worthwhile? I'd say potentially. The Pacers came one game short of winning the championship last season. With Zubac, they could be right back in the Finals. But the prospect of giving up a mid-lottery pick in a loaded draft for someone who's never made an All-Star Game is admittedly terrifying. As of this moment, the Pacers have a 52.1% chance of landing in the top four and a 47.9% chance of handing this pick to the Clippers. It's basically a coin flip. Most teams would do everything in their power to keep it that way, but the Pacers don't really tank like normal teams do. Even this season, Pascal Siakam has played enough for them to make the All-Star team. There's a good chance they play their guys down the stretch and decrease their odds at keeping this pick as everyone around them races to the bottom. We won't truly be able to evaluate this deal until lottery night, but for now. we'll call it a short-term win for Indiana that comes with long-term risk. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Los Angeles Clippers: B+Ivica Zubac is coming off of a career year, is 28 and has a very team-friendly contract. In other words, this is probably the peak for him as a trade asset. He's simply more valuable to a team trying to win a championship in the somewhat near future than he is to a team like the Clippers, that has clearly determined that doing so is no longer possible. That's why they traded James Harden for Darius Garland. They took on a worse player with more injury question marks because he's a decade younger and offers them a path to whatever comes next.\nThis trade works for the same reasons. Indiana was never going to re-sign Mathurin, but the Clippers, with a clean cap sheet moving forward, can pay him easily to be Garland's long-term backcourt partner. He never quite fit into Indiana's movement-heavy system, and he had clearly been supplanted by Aaron Nesmith and Andrew Nembhard in the team's pecking order, but on a more traditional roster, his athleticism and shotmaking still have a chance to be quite valuable. Remember, he's had eight 25-point playoff games in the last two years and he's averaging just under 18 points per game this season. There's more to his game than we've seen in Indiana. Think of the way we talk about Jonathan Kuminga in Golden State. Mathurin is a version of that with far more evidence backing up his potential value.The basic idea of turning Zubac into picks -- especially with the investigation into Kawhi Leonard and his dealings with Aspiration looming here as a threat to their future draft capital -- made sense, though at his age, he also could have reasonably partnered with Garland moving forward.But really, as it does for Indiana, this trade hinges on the lottery. If the Clippers get a pick between No. 5 and No. 9 in this, specific class in exchange for what is ultimately a high-end role player, they get an A+. If they don't, the trade still makes sense. It's just more like a C+ or a B-. Those deep future picks from Indiana are nice assets. They at least represent liquidity, things to trade for different players to pair with Garland and Mathurin when the time is right. But they're unlikely to be high lottery picks. The 2026 selection could be.\nAnd so, we await what should be one of the most important lottery nights in NBA history. Just imagine the drama. The final pick the Clippers owe the Thunder for Paul George, who now plays for the 76ers, may also be in this lottery, and if it jumps up for Oklahoma City, that may nudge Indiana far enough down the draft order to secure a top pick for the Clippers.That will have to wait until May. For now, the Clippers have refilled their pick coffers, added an interesting young prospect, and accepted defeat on this failed era in their history. We may not know how strong their return is for a few months, but that was broadly speaking the right approach to this deadline.\n            ",

Bringing a regular-season game to Rio strengthens our connection to a vibrant and passionate football community and underscores our long-term commitment to the market.\" \nThe NFL has played two games in Brazil over the last two years, but those matchups took place in São Paulo. The Green Bay Packers and Philadelphia Eagles faced off in Corinthians Arena in 2024, followed by the Kansas City Chiefs and Los Angeles Chargers in 2025.\"Building on the success of the games in São Paulo, we could not be more excited to play in one of the world's most iconic cities -- Rio de Janeiro,\" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement announcing the intention to play in Rio de Janeiro earlier this year. \"We look forward to working closely with our city and state partners in Rio along with the historic Maracanã Stadium to deepen our ties to the tens of millions of fans in Brazil and across South America.\"\nThe NFL now has eight international games on its schedule for the 2026 season with one game in Australia, one game in Brazil, one game in Germany, three games in the U.K., one game in France and one game in Spain.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Bucks and Giannis Antetokounmpo can't quit each other. We probably should have seen that coming. The 2026 NBA trade deadline came and went on Thursday without Milwaukee moving its superstar. Giannis took to social media almost immediately after it was official and posted exactly the sort of thing everyone would expect (NSFW language in a \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" clip here).I'm not leaving. I'm not leaving. I'm not f—-ing leaving. Great scene. Leo is excellent. It's obvious enough that Giannis is attempting to do a little damage control here and clean up the narrative about him almost-sorta-but-not-really-but-maybe-but-nevermind-just-kidding-forget-we-ever-mentioned-it leaving Milwaukee this week. The Bucks had been pretty insistent all season that they weren't interested in listening to offers for him -- until last week, when suddenly they were. The Warriors, Wolves, Heat and Knicks were reportedly in line to try to scoop him up. But eventually they all came to realize that the Bucks weren't really serious about getting a deal done and shipping out Antetokounmpo. Not right now. Maybe this summer. But also maybe never. \nGiannis has signaled at every opportunity that he's not the kind of guy who asks out. That's for the James Hardens of the league. That's not for Giannis, and it's evidently important to him that the good people of Milwaukee and the greater basketball-loving world understand that. He seems to think there's something untoward about it, something that perhaps might tarnish his legacy. Which is how we arrived at the Bucks listening to offers while Giannis simultaneously tried to spin it as though he had no agency in the matter. \n        \n            \n                Giannis Antetokounmpo is staying with Bucks at trade deadline: Here's how sweepstakes will change this summer\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nEarlier this week, when it still seemed possible that Giannis and the Bucks would finally part ways, Antetokounmpo gave an emotional interview to the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. He said he'd created more memories in Milwaukee than in his home country of Greece. He noted it's where he became an MVP, won a championship, got married, the place where his kids were born and his father is buried. Cynics might find that last part a bit much, but to me it scanned as genuine and heartfelt. What didn't quite track for me was when he got defensive about his obvious affection for the city. \"So people have the audacity,\" he said, \"to come tell me and say 'this guy really doesn't love Milwaukee.'\"\nReally? People were saying that? Which people? Where? Because for all the back-and-forth will-he-or-won't-he leave oscillation over the last year, there didn't seem to be much criticism levied at Giannis or the Bucks over the potential breakup. If anything, the rational conventional conclusion was that they should part company. The Bucks were (and still are) going nowhere fast in a not terribly competitive Eastern Conference. Meanwhile Giannis had stuck around longer than almost any other superstar would have. He delivered a championship to Milwaukee and then stayed put long after that roster had reached its expiration date. The moment Damian Lillard blew out his Achilles in the first round of last year's playoffs was the moment the Bucks and Giannis should have looked at each other and said thanks for the memories and gone their separate ways. Instead, the organization decided to waive and stretch Lillard's contract, adding $22.5 million in dead money to their books for five straight seasons -- and all so they could sign Myles Turner and put a warm body next to Giannis in an attempt to convince him not to leave.Given the circumstances, if the Bucks had traded him rather than opting for that suspect strategy, no one would have faulted Giannis. Even if Giannis had gone further and actually asked out, no one would have faulted him. But instead of making a clean break of it, we're all stuck in this seemingly endless loop. In the Journal-Sentinel interview prior to the deadline, Giannis was asked what he wants deep down in his heart. He replied \"to be a Milwaukee Buck until I retire and win a championship here. End of sentence.\"\nThat's pretty definitive. There's no guarantee that he'll win another title in Milwaukee, but Giannis certainly has the power to retire as a Buck. If that's really what he wants, then he should sign an extension with the only professional team he's ever known and put an end to the trade speculation for good. If, as he posted \"legends don't chase,\" then he should definitively declare that he's not going anywhere and he wants the Bucks to keep looking for avenues to improve the team around him. He should say it with his whole chest. Because what we've gotten over the last year is less of him trying \"to attract\" -- 100 emoji, sunglass emoji -- than him trying to make it seem like all of this trade talk was out of his hands and avoid any potential PR damage to his reputation. That's how we end up with Giannis doing \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" bit. But hey, great movie. Super rewatchable. Though it is worth remembering the context of the scene Giannis posted.  DiCaprio's character has a chance to walk away and get out clean. Instead he sticks around and everyone cheers and he's the big hero -- right up until it all goes sideways and he catches the blame for everything that comes crashing down. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        A move that would have defined the 2026 NBA trade deadline never manifested as Giannis Antetokounmpo will remain with the Milwaukee Bucks. Antetokounmpo, the most prized target on the trade market, had been the talk of the league for weeks while the Bucks entertained offers. But once the deadline passed, he informed the basketball world that he is not going anywhere -- in the immediate future, at least -- with a social media post.\"Legends don't chase. They attract,\" Antetokounmpo said, attaching a video of an iconic scene from \"The Wolf of Wall Street.\"Indeed, Antetokounmpo is \"not f---ing leaving.\"\nNow poised to remain with the Bucks through the end of the season, Antetokounmpo is not far away from having to make another decision about his future in Milwaukee. He is eligible for a contract extension at the end of the season, and if he refuses to sign, the Bucks will effectively have no choice but to ship him off by the 2027 trade deadline.Antetokounmpo is reportedly \"ready for a new home,\" and even with the Bucks' inaction at the deadline, the momentum still seems to trend toward a split. That is even with the two-time MVP stating this week that he wants to remain with the franchise over the long term.\n\"What I want deep down in my heart is I want to be a Milwaukee Buck for the rest of my career and win here,\" Antetokounmpo said on Tuesday per the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n        \n            \n                Giannis Antetokounmpo is staying with Bucks at trade deadline: Here's how sweepstakes will change this summer\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nA breakup would end the most legendary tenure by a Bucks player. Antetokounmpo delivered a championship to a city that had gone 50 years without one. He is the greatest player to wear a Bucks jersey and is a lock to become a first-ballot Hall of Famer. Leaving Milwaukee before the end of his career will not negate the thrills he brought to the city over the last decade and a half.\"Let's put the Bucks on the side for one second,\" Antetokounmpo said this week to The Athletic. \"Let's talk about the city itself, the memories that I've created here. When you open my kids' passports, it says Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. I had four kids in the span of the last five years in this city.\"My dad is buried in this city. I've built a house for my mom 10 seconds away from my house. Literally, to walk to my mom's front door, it takes me four seconds … right next door. On what planet, on what Earth, would somebody want to leave this?\"\nBucks fans undoubtedly grew tired of the drama surrounding Antetokounmpo's trade saga. What kind of reception they give him when Milwaukee plays its first game on this side of the trade deadline remains to be seen. It was just three weeks ago he and the Fiserv Forum crowd got into a booing match. The Bucks will host the Indiana Pacers on Friday night. \n            ",

The NFL Honors show is Thursday night, when MVP, Offensive and Defensive Player of the Year, Offensive and Defensive Rookie of the Year, Comeback Player of the Year, Coach of the Year and other award winners will be announced.Where to watch the NFL Honors liveDate: Thursday, Feb. 5 | Time: 9 p.m. ETLocation: Palace of Fine Arts (San Francisco)Host: Jon HammTV: NBC/NFL Network | Stream: Peacock/NFL+As with every season, this one was full of twists and turns on both the team and individual level. Halfway through the season, Daniel Jones and Jonathan Taylor were potential MVP or Offensive Player of the Year candidates. Then Jones got hurt, and the Indianapolis Colts didn't make the playoffs. Through six games, Myles Garrett \"only\" had four sacks, on pace for another outstanding year, but not a historically dominant one. Then he finished with 23 sacks, setting the single-season record.Long story short, things change in the blink of an eye. With the regular season long in the rearview mirror, though, CBS Sports' NFL experts have submitted their votes for top individual accolades.Voters (12): Garrett Podell, Joel Corry, JP Acosta, John Breech, Kevin Steimle, Bryan DeArdo, Douglas Clawson, Tyler Sullivan, Jared Dubin, Jordan Dajani, Mike Renner, Zach Pereles\nMVPDrake Maye, Patriots (7votes)Matthew Stafford, Rams (5)In -- spoiler alert -- the closest vote of all of the major awards, Maye edges out Stafford. Stafford was the first-team All-Pro selection, which, historically, points to him winning MVP. But it's not an absolute. In fact, just last year, Lamar Jackson was the first-team All-Pro quarterback, but Josh Allen won MVP. Maye led the NFL in completion percentage (72%), yards per attempt (8.9), passer rating (113.5) and expected points added per dropback (0.28) this season.Defensive Player of the YearMyles Garrett, Browns (12 votes)The only unanimous pick from our experts, Garrett was an easy choice after his record-setting campaign. Perhaps the race for second place will be more intriguing, with four other superstar edge defenders -- Will Anderson Jr., Nik Bonitto, Aidan Hutchinson and Micah Parsons -- named as finalists alongside Garrett.Offensive Player of the YearJaxon Smith-Njigba, Seahawks, (9 votes)Puka Nacua, Rams (2)Christian McCaffrey, 49ers (1)Smith-Njigba led the NFL in receiving yards (1,793), Nacua led the NFL in receptions (129) and receiving yards per game (107.2), and McCaffrey led the NFL in touches (413) and was second in yards from scrimmage (2.126). But Smith-Njigba, with his remarkable consistency, gets the nod. His 16 games with at least 70 receiving yards were tied for the most in a single season in league history.\nDefensive Rookie of the YearCarson Schwesinger, Browns (9 votes)Nick Emmanwori, Seahawks (2)James Pearce Jr., Falcons (1)Schwesinger racked up 156 tackles in a strong rookie season, and he added 11 tackles for loss, 2.5 sacks and two interceptions for good measure, too. The last rookie with at least 150 tackles, double-digit tackles for loss, two sacks and two interceptions was Shaquille Leonard in 2018; he won Defensive Rookie of the Year.Offensive Rookie of the YearTetairoa McMillan, Panthers (10 votes)TIE: Jaxson Dart, Giants; Grey Zabel, Seahawks (1)McMillan is the easy choice in the eyes of most of our voters after a 70-catch, 1,014-yard, seven-touchdown debut campaign, but Dart and Zabel also earned a vote. Dart threw for 15 touchdowns and ran for nine more despite only playing in 12 games; Zabel has been a key addition along the interior of the offensive line for Super Bowl-bound Seattle.Comeback Player of the YearChristian McCaffrey, 49ers (8 votes)Aidan Hutchinson, Lions (2)TIE: Stefon Diggs, Patriots; Dak Prescott, Cowboys (1)After playing in just four games last year due to Achilles tendinitis and a PCL sprain, McCaffrey played in 17 games for the second time in his career and was seemingly the only healthy 49ers offensive skill player all year. As Brock Purdy, George Kittle, Ricky Pearsall, Jauan Jennings and others all missed time, McCaffrey just kept going. He recorded his second season with at least 1,000 rushing yards and 900 receiving yards, tying Marshall Faulk for most all time.\nCoach of the YearMike Vrabel, Patriots (6 votes)Mike Macdonald, Seahawks (4)Kyle Shanahan, 49ers (3)The Patriots are the first team to make the Super Bowl after losing 13 or more games the previous season, and Vrabel's role in that turnaround earns him his second Coach of the Year award (he also won it in 2021 with the Titans). Macdonald, who will stand opposite Vrabel in Super Bowl LX, and Shanahan were close behind.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- The Super Bowl isn't just about football, it's also about food and I found that out first-hand on Wednesday during a trip to Levi's Stadium where the culinary team at Levy Restaurants unveiled all the food that will be served on Super Bowl Sunday. When you spend thousands of dollars on a Super Bowl ticket, there's definitely an expectation that you'll be able to buy something better than a hot dog at the game and that will certainly be the case this week when Patriots and Seahawks fans arrive at Super Bowl LX. For this year's big game, Levy Restaurants was in charge of creating a menu that would give fans a true taste of the Bay Area and all I have to say is, mission accomplished. As someone who once lived in San Francisco for four years, I've tasted almost everything the city has to offer and all of that will be available at the game. \n        \n            \n                Super Bowl 2026: Where to watch Seahawks vs. Patriots with TV channel, live stream and kickoff time\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe most shocking thing on the menu is definitely the $180 burger, but we're not going to start there, because we're going to start with seafood. \nWhen you're playing a Super Bowl just 1.5 miles away from the San Francisco Bay, you have to have seafood and this game will have plenty of that. For one, fans will be able to buy OYSTERS at the game. There will be shuckers set up throughout the stadium with Hog Island Oysters that are straight from Tomales Bay in Marin County. There will be oyster plates set up throughout the stadium. \n                                                                    CBS Sports/Tyler Sullivan\n                                                            Of course, not everyone likes oysters and if you're not an oyster person, don't worry. There are plenty of other seafood options like the Dungeness crab potatchos. With the the stadium located so close to a major body of water, the plan is for the crab to be caught just two days before the game. What's the difference between potatchos and nachos? Glad you asked. Instead of using tortilla chips, the Dungeness crab potatchos will use Kennebec potato chips and those will be covered in Petaluma white cheddar fondue sauce, sea salt and chives. \nIf you're not a potatcho person, don't worry, there will also be some regular nachos: The Silicon Valley Grande Nachos.  Everyone loves nachos.  \n                                                                    John Breech/CBS Sports\n                                                            These tasty nachos feature pork chorizo, beef brisket, queso bravo and guacamole. OK, let's leave Silicon Valley and head to another part of the Bay. Chinatown is a popular spot in San Francisco and the culinary team at Levi's Stadium did their best to honor the tastes from that part of town with multiple dishes. Not only will there be Dim Sum on the menu, but there will also be a Chinatown Dawg, which will feature a Char-grilled footlong all-beef hot dog topped with Chinese hot mustard, char siu pork, sriracha, and shredded yellow daikon. \nOne of the most famous side dishes in San Francisco is the city's garlic fries, and yes, those will also be available at the big game. If you need to pair your fries with something you could go with the NorCal Steakhouse Burger, which is an American wagyu patty, seared and topped with Applewood smoked bacon, bone marrow aioli, Point Reyes Toma and spicy house brined pickles on a locally-made brioche bun. From left to right: The Chinatown Dawg, the NorCal Steak burger and the garlic fries. Yum.  \n                                                                    CBS Sports/John Breech\n                                                            Alright, now let's get to the main event, which is actually a double main event. The Super Bowl will be serving something called the The LX Hammer Burger, which is the largest burger I have ever seen in my life. When I say this thing is bigger than my head, I'm not exaggerating. And also, I have a big head. Here's what this monster burger looks like (And if you scroll through on Instagram here, you can check out 10 other food items): \nThis might be the biggest burger ever served at a Super Bowl.  \n                                                                    John Breech/CBS Sports\n                                                            This monster features a braised bone-in beef shank, roasted mirepoix demi-glace, and Point Reyes blue cheese fondue on a brioche bun. I posted a photo of this burger on Instagram and I'm guessing that won't be the last time it's posted on Instagram because anyone who buys one on Sunday will probably be sharing their experience with it on social media. The burger weighs more than a small baby. If you can finish this burger on your own, you should win tickets to next year's Super Bowl. The other main event is the Chef-carved Sonoma Mountain Beef-Chetta. This will only be available to a very small portion of the stadium, but if you can get your hands on it, it features local grass-fed organic beef from Marin County that's sliced and served with confit garlic. It's also covered in a cabernet demi-glace and horseradish crème with pull-part rolls.Only people in the owner's club will have access to this piece of meat.  \n                                                                    John Breech/CBS Sports\n                                                            Of course, after you eat, you'll need something to wash down your food and definitely won't be an issue at Levi's Stadium. Here's a quick look at several of the alcoholic options that will be featured along with the description of the drink from Levy Restaurants: \nKarl the Fog misty spritz: A spritzy tribute to the Bay's famous fog. Tanqueray Gin mixed with elderflower liqueur, club soda and fresh lemon juice. Chinatown's fortune cookie martini: Smirnoff vanilla vodka, amaretto, Bailey's Irish Cream and cold brew, shaken and topped with a custom chocolate-dipped fortune cookie from Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory. Halftime show Margarita: Don Julio Reposado with chili watermelon margarita mix and a Tajin rim. Kickoff tequila sunrise: Astral Blanco mixed with fresh orange juice and cherry juice, garnished with orange and maraschino cherry. Available in the East Field Club, Bud Light Club and 400 East Club. Pier 39 paloma: Casamigos Reposado shaken with fresh lime juice, agave syrup and ruby red grapefruit juice. Available at Tequileria Bars and bars near Gates A and C. Golden Gate mule: Crown Royal Whiskey, ginger beer and lime juice mixed with passion fruit liqueur. I did take a video of each drink, but I did not get to sample them, which was probably for the best. \nIf Sam Darnold throws an interception, Seahawks fans can drown their sorrows in one of these tasty drinks. If he throws two, they can have two drinks. If he throws three, then I'd suggest just buying one of each. There will also be an alcoholic milkshake available and I did get taste that and I will be making these at home on a regular basis from now on. \nMeet the Fog City frozen Irish coffee.  \n                                                                    John Breech/CBS Sports\n                                                            And of course, let's not forget about dessert. There will be a San Francisco sticky bun for sale. This might be the most delicious sticky bun ever made.  It doesn't \"look\" like anything special, but my goodness, it might be the tastiest thing I've ever put in my mouth. The man in charge of the culinary team at Levi's Stadium is Lou Bastian, who serves as the senior vice president of culinary at Levy. This is the fourth time Bastian has been in charge of the food for a Super Bowl, so he's pretty experienced at this point and that shows. The food at the Super Bowl isn't cheap, but nothing is at the big game, so anyone who will be at Levi's Stadium on Sunday, be sure to bring some extra money so you can sample all the tasty food that's being offered. \nIf you need me, I'll be making a fortune cookie martini in my hotel room.  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Attending a Super Bowl is on a lot of bucket lists. It's the only American professional major sport that's determined in one game and is at a neutral location, which makes it a unique experience for fans.The Super Bowl is a week-long event, with parties, celebrity appearances and countless NFL themed things to do and see.Every year the Super Bowl becomes a star-studded event, with some of the most famous actors, singers and athletes in the crowd.Last year, all eyes were on Taylor Swift, who was cheering on her fiancé, Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. I doubt she will be at Super Bowl LX on Sunday to watch the Patriots take on the Seahawks, but regardless there will certainly be no shortage of famous faces.\nThere are some celebrities who won't just be attending because it's a fun outing and a social event, while others will be on the edge of their seat because their team is on the field.Here are some famous Patriots fans who we might see cheering on Drake Maye, Mike Vrabel and Co. on Feb. 8. Famous Patriots fansJon Bon Jovi: The singer is a longtime Patriots fan, often seen at games in the same box as owner Robert Kraft. His song \"This Is Our House\" is a staple at Gillette Stadium The Patriots chose him to introduce the team at Super Bowl LX. \nCardi B: The rapper isn't a lifelong fan, but she sure has adapted to the Patriot way quickly. Her boyfriend and the father of one of her children is Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs, so she has a clear rooting interest. She is constantly on social media cheering for the team and showing her Patriots pride, so I have no doubt that she will be in attendance.Ben Affleck: The King of Dunkin embodies Boston and that includes his sports fandom. He is often attending games and expressing his love for the team. Matt Damon: Another Boston icon is Matt Damon, who is best friends with Affleck. The two argue over who is the bigger fan and are two celebrities I wouldn't be surprised to see on Sunday. \nMark Wahlberg: The actor has been to past Patriots Super Bowls, but got heat during Super Bowl LI when he left while the Patriots were down 28-3 against the Falcons. He missed the comeback and likely learned his lesson. Never leave a Super Bowl early.Aly Raisman: The Olympian is a Massachusetts native. She is a loyal Patriots fan and was even honored at a game. She credits Tom Brady for being one reason she made a return to the Olympics in 2016, as an inspiration showing her she wasn't too old to compete.John Krazinski: The Office star is another proud supporter of New England sports.\nMindy Kaling: Another Office star who loves the Patriots is Mindy Kaling. She frequently talks about growing up in New England.Tom Brady: One might think he would be rooting for his former teammate, Vrabel, and his former team, but the Raiders part-owner said he has \"no dog in the fight.\" So we won't officially include him in this list. Here are some more famous Pats fans:Singer Steven Tyler Singer Sir Elton John Comedian Conan O'Brien Actor Chris EvansActress Elizabeth BanksComedian Bill BurrTelevision host Maria MenounosFamous Seahawks fansChris Pratt: The actor is a lifelong Seahawks fan and is often spotted showing his Seattle pride. The Washington native was chosen to introduce the team for Super Bowl LX.\nWill Ferrell: The comedian has attended games and is friends with former Seahawks coach Pete Carroll. He even once crashed a team meeting on zoom, pretending to be their new tight end.Rainn Wilson: Unlike some of his Office costars mentioned above, Wilson is a 'Hawks fan. He's visited training camp and even tried a few drills himself, like attempting a field goal.Bill Nye: This \"science guy\" began his career in Seattle, pitching the show \"Bill Nye the Science Guy\" to a Seattle public broadcasting station. He now lives lives near Seattle and has served as the team's 12 Flag Raiser. \nDave Matthews: The singer is another celebrity who has raised the team's 12th Man Flag. He also raised the flag at the top of the Space Needle before Super Bowl XLIX against the Patriots. Macklemore: The rapper and Seattle native performed at the NFC Championship and Super Bowl after party during the team's championship run during the 2013 season.Richard Sherman: The Seahawks legend became a meme for his reaction when the Patriots defeated the Seahawks in 2015. I expect him to be rooting for his old team to get revenge this weekend.\nHere are some other famous Seahawks fans:Comedian Joel McHaleNBA's Jamal CrawfordActor Jeffrey Dean Morgan\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Seattle Seahawks appear to have avoided a significant setback days before they face the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LX. Nick Emmanwori, Seattle's standout rookie safety, was limited during Wednesday's practice after suffering a low ankle sprain. Despite the injury, Emmanwori said that he expects to play on Sunday. \"Feel good,\" he said during Thursday's media availability. \"Training staff has a good plan for me. ... I'll be good to go.\" Emmanwori rolled the ankle while defending a pass during Wednesday's practice. He walked off the field under his own power while being comforted by teammates and coaches, according to a pool report from the Pro Football Writers of America. \"He had an ankle, we brought him in to look at it, and we'll kind of go from here and figure out what are the next steps,\" Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald said Wednesday per the pool reporter on hand. \nMacdonald said Thursday he \"fully expects\" Emmanwori to play, but the team is going to treat the situation cautiously.\nOne of the NFL's top-performing rookies this season, Emmanwori has played a key role in Seattle getting to its third Super Bowl and first since the 2014 season. The 35th overall pick in last year's draft, Emmanwori started in 11 of Seattle's 14 regular season games. He tallied 81 tackles, 2.5 sacks, an interception and broke up 11 passes while helping the Seahawks boast the NFL's top-ranked scoring defense. Emmanwori recovered a fumble during Seattle's blowout win over the San Francisco 49ers in the divisional round and broke up three passes during the Seahawks' win over the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC Championship game. \nWhile Seattle has an experienced backup in safety Ty Okada, Emmanwori's versatility makes him a valuable commodity in Seattle's defense. \n        \n            \n                Prisco's pick for Seahawks vs. Patriots in Super Bowl 2026: Stout Seattle defense shuts down New England\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nFour other Seahawks were limited in practice on Wednesday, including quarterback Sam Darnold, who has been nursing an oblique injury he suffered in practice on Jan. 15. Darnold has been limited in each practice since injuring the oblique, and Macdonald said his quarterback is \"right on schedule.\"\"We've had this plan here over the last X amount of weeks, and it varies every day,\" Macdonald told the PFWA pool reporter. \"And today he had a great day, so we're right on schedule.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 Australian Open begins on Saturday night, with several exciting storylines set to unfold in both draws. Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz headline the Australian Open men's draw, as they look to meet in another Grand Slam final. Aryna Sabalenka has won multiple Australian Open women's titles and has appeared in three straight finals, so she headlines the Australian Open women's draw. Sinner is the -115 favorite on the men's side, while Sabalenka is the +200 favorite on the women's side, per the latest Australian Open odds. SportsLine expert Jose Onorato has locked in his best bets for both draws, featuring a pair of longshots.  Before locking in your Australian Open picks for the first Grand Slam of the season, be sure to check out the top tennis betting picks from Onorato.New users can target the all-new DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Onorato has gone 168-106-8 (+107.12 units) on his best bets since 2022.

He currently ranks among the tour's best in both service games held and return games won on outdoor hard. His win rate against top-10 opponents on the surface is outstanding, and his tiebreak record highlights how well his game holds up in pressure moments. If he's fully healthy, there's no better anchor at the top of the board.\"New users can get a first bet matched up to $250 with the latest Caesars promo code. You can claim the offer here: Carlos Alcaraz (+180)\"While Alcaraz has yet to win in Melbourne, he's already claimed Slam titles on every other surface and remains one of the most complete threats in the game,\" Onorato said. \"His hard-court metrics remain elite, with a win rate above 75 percent over the past two years and one of the highest return points won percentages against second serves. He's beaten nearly every top seed in both best-of-three and best-of-five conditions and has the physicality and resilience to handle the tough back end of a Slam. If anyone is going to stop Sinner, this is the most logical challenger.\"New users can target the all-new DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: Alex De Minaur (+7000)\"The home crowd will be behind him, but it's not just narrative. De Minaur has quietly put together a strong stretch on outdoor hard, improving his serve and finishing more points early in rallies,\" Onorato said. \"His physical conditioning is elite, and he's become more willing to step into the court and dictate when given time. He's posted quality wins over top-10 players in recent months, and his rally tolerance and court speed make him well-suited for long matches in the Australian heat. If the draw breaks his way, he could be the unexpected name in the semifinals.\"New users can get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 bet with the latest FanDuel promo code.

She's won multiple Australian Open titles and has reached the final three years in a row,\" Onorato said. \"Her power game thrives in quick conditions, and her ability to win short rallies makes her perfectly suited to this surface. Statistically, she ranks near the top of the WTA in first-serve points won, ace rate, and short-rally points (0–4 shots). If she serves well, there are very few women who can stay with her for three sets. She should be considered the top contender again in 2026.\"New users can get a first bet matched up to $250 with the latest Caesars promo code. You can claim the offer here:Iga Świątek (+550)\"Swiatek has yet to lift the trophy in Australia but remains one of the most reliable all-surface performers on the WTA. Her return game is unmatched, consistently ranking among the top two or three in return games won. She also tends to dispatch lower-ranked opponents in straight sets, which helps manage physical load across the two weeks,\" Onorato said. \"While she hasn't looked quite as comfortable on hard as she does on clay, her numbers on the surface remain elite. If her serve holds up, she's just as dangerous as Sabalenka over the course of a Slam.\"With the latest BetMGM bonus code, new users can get up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses. Claim the offer here: Mirra Andreeva (+1700)\"At just 18 years old, Andreeva already has a Slam semifinal under her belt and the tactical maturity of a veteran. Her ability to vary pace, absorb power, and construct points gives her a real shot on hard courts,\" Onorato said. \"She's posted wins over multiple top-10 players, and her game holds up under pressure. Her return positioning and ability to redirect pace make her particularly tough in fast conditions. If she handles the early rounds cleanly, her all-court game could carry her into the second week once again.\"New users can get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 bet with the latest FanDuel promo code.

The fight, originally scrapped from UFC 303 in June 2024, has been floated by fans as a potential addition to the UFC's planned event at the White House this summer. UFC matchmakers will soon begin working on the White House card, tentatively planned to coincide with President Trump's birthday on June 14. On Thursday, White told Complex he wouldn't book McGregor vs. Chandler for the White House.\"No,\" White said. \"I mean, that was a couple of years ago.\" White's statement shouldn't alarm fans hoping to see McGregor at the White House. Previously, White placed \"a billion to one odds\" that former two-division champion Jon Jones would be booked for the card. By contrast, White is keeping an open mind about a McGregor comeback.\n\"We'll see if Conor's going to come back or not,\" White said. \"We've  been talking about it for a while. We'll see. We'll see how it plays  out. I don't know, though.\" McGregor has campaigned hard to compete at the White House. He officially rejoined the UFC's drug testing pool in August, a prerequisite for competition. McGregor, a former two-division champion and the sport's biggest star, has not competed in professional mixed martial arts since July 2021. His previously scheduled fight with Chandler, which was meant to headline UFC International Fight Week in 2024, was canceled after McGregor pulled out with an injured toe. \nWith Chandler out of the way, the prevailing fan theory is a trilogy fight with Nate Diaz. McGregor and Diaz are split in their series, which took place 10 years ago. Diaz is not currently signed to the UFC.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The SEC is the toughest conference in women's college basketball and two of the heavyweights will face each other on Thursday night in one of the biggest regular-season games of the season. No. 2 South Carolina is hosting No. 4 Texas in a rematch of the Players Era championship in November, and this game could be a huge resume booster when March comes around.These opponents know each other well, as this will be their sixth meeting in 369 days. In all of these games, both teams have been ranked in the AP top five.South Carolina is 17-1 this season, with the Gamecocks' lone loss coming at the hands of the Longhorns in November. That game did not count toward their SEC record, which means Dawn Staley's team is still undefeated in conference play. Meanwhile, Texas is 18-1 overall and 3-1 in SEC play after a loss to LSU last weekend. Here is everything you need to know ahead of this top five matchup.Where to watch No. 4 Texas at No. 2 South CarolinaDate: Thursday, Jan. 15 | Time: 7 p.m. ETLocation: Colonial Life Arena, Columbia, South CarolinaTV: ESPN2 | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)Odds (via FanDuel): South Carolina -3.5, O/U: 137.5\nHow Texas won in NovemberSouth Carolina leads this series 5-4 dating back to 1988, including a win at the Final Four last April. However, Texas took the most recent victory with a last-second shot by Rori Harmon at the Players Era championship game in Las Vegas.At that point, South Carolina was ranked No. 2 and Texas was No. 4. The Longhorns had defeated then-No. 3 UCLA the previous day, which meant they became the first team in at least 25 years to defeat two top-three ranked opponents in back-to-back games.Texas only used a seven-player rotation against South Carolina due to injuries, but that was all the Longhorns needed. Harmon finished the game with only six points, but she was invaluable to her team's offense with nine assists. Madison Booker had 16 points and 9 rebounds, while Jordan Lee led all scorers with 19 points.\nFour South Carolina players scored in double figures, led by 16 points from Ta'Niya Latson. Madina Okot also stood out with a double-double of 12 points and 11 rebounds.\nCan Texas 'get ready' and bounce back after LSU loss on Sunday and Vic Schaefer's post-game rant?Texas is no longer undefeated after suffering a 70-65 loss to LSU last weekend. Although the Longhorns' offense has seen a significant boost from last season, they struggled mightily in Baton Rouge. Vic Shaefer's team has one of the top assists/turnover ratios in the country, but on Sunday, his team registered a season-high 17 turnovers and just 9 assists.Mikaylah Williams severely limited Booker in the first half. Meanwhile, Lee only made three field goals and Harmon sat out the fourth quarter. \nDuring the postgame press conference, Booker said her team needed to figure out how to get ready for South Carolina because they didn't show they were prepared on Sunday. Schaefer was also vocal about disliking a schedule in which they had to play LSU and South Carolina back-to-back on the road. \nDefense and rebounding will be keyOne of the things that helped LSU beat Texas was winning the rebounding battle 44-35. Staley highlighted this as one of the key areas that helped the Tigers and also something she wants her team to focus on.Defense will also be key as these are two teams in the top 15 nationally in scoring defense. Their offenses have been productive against other opponents, but this won't necessarily be a high-scoring affair. Texas' lowest scoring games this season have been against top SEC opponents South Carolina (66-64 win) and LSU (70-65 loss). As for the Gamecocks, they only reached 65 points in wins against Clemson and Georgia, but their 66-64 loss to Texas was a season low.\n\"They make it hard,\" Staley said. \"They make it hard for you to make entry passes. Anywhere on the floor. Anywhere. For us, we just have to be disciplined. Disciplined as to the way that we want to play defense and not give them multiple ways of coming off screens. You gotta give them one direction, and that's hard enough to guard, but when you give them options you are going to be running all over the place expending energy that we need on the defensive side of the ball, as well as the offensive side of the ball.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Calm and soft conditions early in the first round of the 2026 PGA Tour season saw the same man who reigned supreme at Waialae Country Club the year prior shoot out to the opening lead once again. Nick Taylor was flawless in the initial refrain of his Sony Open title defense as the Canadian carded a bogey-free 62 to command a share of the lead with Kevin Roy.Taylor's effort marked his 17 straight par-or-better round at Waialae Country Club, the last 12 coming under par. \"I think we got lucky with the forecast this morning. I expected some more wind,\" Taylor said. \"I read I think Michael Kim had a tweet about the direction of the wind this year, which was pretty accurate in the sense [that] a lot of the wind is doing with the dogleg, so it felt like some of the tee shots maybe weren't as challenging. I hit it great, but again, this course fits my eye. Irons were really sharp, and [I] was able to read the greens well.\"The five-time PGA Tour winner was in control from the onset as he rolled in two early birdies to get his year underway. A diet of pars filled his appetite for his next hour before he made the turn towards the outward half and made six birdies across his final 10 holes.\nTaylor was not the only winner from the 2025 season to look the part, however, as Ben Griffin and Chris Gotterup were up to something similar, carding matching 63s to sit one back. Griffin won in his final start of 2025 at the World Wide Technology Championship, while Gotterup credited a couple of matches in TGL the last few weeks for helping him assimilate to competitive golf without a hitch.\"You never really know what the first round back is going to feel like,\" Griffin said. \"It's been a couple months since I've competed out here. So played a decent amount at home and felt like I was playing well. When you tee up in a Tour event, it always feels a little bit different. So was really happy with my ball striking. Was happy with the way my overall game felt. Need to clean up a couple things, but overall, really happy with the way I played.\"Wind picked up in the afternoon and so did bogeys on scorecards as scoring proved to be more than one stroke more difficult by day's end. Caught in the breeze was former tournament champion Hideki Matsuyama, who signed for a 69 alongside U.S. Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley and Jordan Spieth, both of whom fired 68s. The trio will have a quick turnaround Friday morning where they will hope to turn on the gas towards the top of the leaderboard and play themselves into weekend contention.\nLeadersT1. Nick Taylor, Kevin Roy (-8): Taylor wasn't coming in totally cold as he traveled to South Africa last month to play in a DP World Tour event. Crediting the buildup to that tournament as a way to stay sharp, the 37-year-old arrived in Hawaii with additional friends and family and with a mindset ripe for a successful defense.On Thursday, he played about as stress-free golf as stress-free golf can look. Taylor connected on 10 fairways, 15 greens in regulation and regularly kept the course in front of him. A certified closer, Taylor now looks to keep this going. He knows that, if he gets to Sunday with his name on the first page of the leaderboard, there is a good chance it remains in first by the end of the tournament.\"I was saying earlier, I think I kind of timed the offseason well,\" Taylor said. \"I didn't want to like play nothing for four months, so I had a couple tournaments after two months off to have something to gear up towards and take time off. I felt like that was about a month before this. Geared up to that, played decent, and took what I needed from it. Yeah, felt like my game was sharp coming over here. You never know. Coming to do a course I'm comfortable with definitely helps.\"\nContendersT3. Ben Griffin, Chris Gotterup, John Vanderlaan (-7)T6. Alex Smalley, John Parry (-6)T8. Denny McCarthy, Kurt Kitayama, Harry Hall, Russell Henley, Nick Dunlap, Adam Svensson (-5)In his first two seasons on the PGA Tour, Gotterup failed to gather a single top 10 finish across January, February and March. Sick of the idea of starting his season slow again, the Scottish Open winner decided to make the move to Florida this past offseason to practice more and keep his game sharp.\"I made a move this offseason down to Florida for hopefully reasons like this,\" Gotterup said. \"Feel like my game is in better shape just because I've been putting in more work at home. Yeah, me and my caddie were joking that playing TGL the last couple weeks has definitely helped me get ready for feeling some juice, and then playing in Grant Thornton and the Bahamas. I've played a decent amount the last couple weeks and months. Yeah, I feel like I'm in a pretty good spot.\"\nGotterup's move paid dividends on Thursday as he carded eight birdies against just one bogey to position himself one stroke behind the leaders. The big-hitting right-hander bullied Waialae CC into submission with an average driving distance north of 310 yards.\"I felt like, the last couple years, I started the tournaments really rough out of the gate,\" Gotterup continued. \"I loved living in Oklahoma, but 40 degrees and 40 mile an hour winds in December is not ideal for coming to Palm Springs or Hawai'i. So I just figured that was the smart move to make. One round through, it looks good. Yeah, it's tough leaving a place you call home for a little while. Yeah, got a new home now.\"2026 Sony Open updated picks, oddsOdds via DraftKings SportsbookBen Griffin: 5-1Nick Taylor: 6-1Russell Henley: 8-1Chris Gotterup: 11-1J.J. Spaun: 19-1Maverick McNealy: 20-1Kevin Roy: 20-1Harry Hall: 20-1Spaun at 19-1 is intriguing. The U.S. Open champion did not make a ton on the greens on Thursday but still came in with a 4-under 66. The price is similar to the pretournament number, and his ball striking looked much like it did last year, which should allow him to make up ground over the next 54 holes. Berger at 45-1 should also be considered following his 66 in the much more difficult afternoon wave.\n            ",

It was a lineup already stuffed with superstars at the top, and now Kyle Tucker, the top free agent available this offseason, has been added to the mix. Tucker and the Dodgers on Thursday night agreed to a four-year, $240 million pact with a pair of opt outs, and now Roberts' lineup will include Tucker, Shohei Ohtani, Freddie Freeman, Mookie Betts, and Will Smith, for starters. Now let's get back to that enviable problem that will confront Roberts this season as he and the Dodgers attempt to pull off the elusive three-peat. Here's a reasonably educated guess: Shohei Ohtani, DH, Bats: LMookie Betts, SS, Bats: RFreddie Freeman, 1B, Bats: LKyle Tucker, RF, Bats: LWill Smith, C, Bats: RMax Muncy, 3B, Bats: LTeoscar Hernández, LF, Bats: RAndy Pages, CF, Bats: RTommy Edman, 2B, Bats: B \n        \n            \n                Winners and losers of the Kyle Tucker signing: Dodgers, Mets, Blue Jays, Cody Bellinger and more\n                \n                    R.J. Anderson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhen it comes to filling out a Dodger lineup that now includes the likes of Tucker, it makes sense to lean on the certainties to begin. Ohtani is going to bat leadoff and Betts is almost certainly going to bat second. After those first two slots, things are less obvious. Do you keep Freeman in the No. 3 spot even though Tucker figures to out-produce him? After all, Freeman, while still an excellent hitter, is going into his age-36 season, and Tucker was putting up MVP numbers before nagging injuries sapped his numbers down the stretch with the Cubs last season. On the other hand, Tucker has remarkably balanced platoon splits for his career and he could punish a lefty reliever who's summoned to face Freeman and his less balanced splits. For now, Tucker gets cleanup duty. \nSmith, one of the best-hitting catchers in baseball, comes next. If Freeman shows signs of decline in 2026, then perhaps you elevate Tucker to the third spot and put Smith at cleanup, but for now the future Hall of Famer Freeman has more than earned the benefit of the doubt. For that matter, let's address Betts and the fact that he's coming off the worst offensive season of his career. If he further declines at the plate in 2026, then it'll be hard to justify keeping him that high in the lineup. If that's the case, then maybe Roberts will be nudged into a top four that goes Ohtani-Tucker-Smith-Freeman. That, much like the theoretical dropping of Freeman in the order, is for months down the road.Moving on, Muncy and his corrective eyewear make a strong six hitter, and then comes Hernández, who has good pop by back-half-of-the-lineup standards. Pages brings youth and upside to the eight hole and the switch-hitting Edman winds things up at No. 9. Last season, two concerns for the Dodgers were the lack of lineup depth and the age of their core hitters. Tucker addresses both issues, and his presence gives Roberts an abundance of options at the front end of the lineup and also paths to take if one of his older stalwart hitters begins showing his years in 2026.\nSure, where to deploy Tucker is a difficult decision in a certain sense, but any plausible answer is a correct answer. Framed another way, the team that last season ranked second in MLB in runs scored, second in home runs, second in wOBA, and third in xwOBA just added a player who in 2026 might be their second-best hitter. It's a fearsome top five in L.A. no matter how you shuffle the pieces. \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

On Thursday night, the Los Angeles Dodgers and top-ranked free agent Kyle Tucker agreed to a massive four-year contract worth $240 million. There are a modest $30 million in deferrals, per The Athletic, broken down into $10 million per year from 2027-29, as well as a $64 million signing bonus, according to ESPN. The deferrals lower the present-day value down to $57.1 million per year, otherwise it would have been a record $60 million annually. Tucker can opt out after the 2027 and 2028 seasons.Tucker reportedly had a 10-year offer at unknown money on the table from the Toronto Blue Jays, but he instead took a short-term, high-dollar contract with the two-time defending World Series champions. Here are the highest average annual salaries in baseball history:Kyle Tucker, Dodgers: $57.1 million (after deferrals)Juan Soto, Mets: $51 millionShohei Ohtani, Dodgers: $46.1 million (after deferrals)Max Scherzer, Mets: $43.3 millionJustin Verlander, Mets: $43.3 million\n        \n            \n                Winners and losers of the Kyle Tucker signing: Dodgers, Mets, Blue Jays, Cody Bellinger and more\n                \n                    R.J. Anderson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Mets offered Tucker four years, $220 million, according to the New York Post. In the end, Tucker took more dollars on a similar short-term deal from the team that has won the last two World Series and doesn't have questions about clubhouse chemistry hanging over its head. Not hard to understand why the Dodgers won this bidding war, though I'm sure passing up Toronto's reported 10-year offer was a difficult decision.\nLast week, we examined what a short-term contract for Tucker could look like. Alex Bregman's three-year deal worth $40 million a year with the Boston Red Sox, which included opt outs after each year, felt like the floor for Tucker, and he beat that handily. He's two years younger now than Bregman was when he signed with Boston, and he's coming off a better year (4.5 WAR vs. 4.2 WAR). Here's what we wrote about the Dodgers being a potential landing spot for Tucker last week:It's definitely not great for the rest of baseball that Tucker aligns  almost perfectly with what the two-time defending World Series champions  need. Specifically, they must improve their outfield defense and they  need another middle-of-the-order bat. A short-term arrangement with  Tucker would also keep a path clear for top prospects Josue De Paula and Zyhir Hope down the line. The Dodgers offered Bryce Harper a four-year, $180 million contract back in the day. Why not try something similar with Tucker?Tucker is the eighth nine-figure contract on the Dodgers roster, joining Ohtani, Mookie Betts, Freddie Freeman, Tyler Glasnow, Will Smith, Blake Snell, and Yoshinobu Yamamoto. Add in the Edwin Díaz signing earlier this winter, and Los Angeles is up to a $398.6 million competitive balance tax payroll for 2026, per FanGraphs. That is actually a bit below last year's $417.3 million mark, which led to a record-smashing $169.4 million CBT bill. Point is, this is once again a $500 million roster between payroll and tax.\nIncluding deferred payments owed in the future, the Dodgers have over $2.1 billion in contracts on their books at the moment. They can thank Ohtani and his unmatched revenue-generating ability for that, plus winning pays for itself. The Dodgers have been very good for very long, and they have two straight years of World Series revenue coming in. It is true that not every team (no other team?) could spend this way. It also true few other teams would spend this way if they had the chance. No team invests in its roster like Los Angeles.\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

Mateer completed 62.2% of his passes for 2,885 yards, 14 touchdowns and 11 interceptions in 12 games played this past season, and added 431 yards and eight more touchdowns on the ground. The Sooners made the College Football Playoff as the No. 8 seed, but were defeated by Alabama, 34-24. Mateer threw for 307 yards, two touchdowns, one interception and rushed for a touchdown in the playoff loss. It marked his 15th game with a passing touchdown and a rushing touchdown. No other FBS player has more than 12 such games over the last two years. Mateer's first season in Norman started off promising, as the Sooners registered victories against Illinois State, No. 15 Michigan and Temple. However, in the 24-17 victory over No. 22 Auburn, Mateer suffered an injury to his throwing hand that required surgery. He missed the following game against Kent State, but returned for the Red River Rivalry less than three weeks later. It ended up being Oklahoma's first loss of the season, as Mateer threw for 202 yards and three interceptions in a 23-6 defeat to Texas.Oklahoma finished out the regular season 5-1 following the loss to Texas, but Mateer did not look like the same dynamic offensive threat. He crossed 200 yards passing just twice in the Sooners' final six games of the regular season, and threw six touchdowns compared to four interceptions. However, Mateer did register 300 yards passing in the final two games of the season, including the playoff loss to Alabama. \nOne has to wonder what Oklahoma would have looked like had Mateer not sustained that hand injury. Now, he gets another shot to lead the Sooners to glory. Mateer was 247Sports' No. 1 transfer portal prospect last year. In his final season at Washington State, Mateer completed 64.6% of his passes for 3,139 yards, 29 touchdowns and seven interceptions. As a runner, Mateer put together a historic campaign, rushing 178 times for 826 yards and 15 more scores. His 44 total touchdowns were tied for the most in the FBS with No. 1 overall pick Cam Ward, and he was one of just two FBS quarterbacks to throw for 20 touchdowns and rush for 10 touchdowns.\n            \n    ",

Huff suffered the injury in practice earlier this week.Huff, a junior, has been terrific for the No. 9 Bulldogs this season. His 17.8 points per game leads the team and represents a 6.8-points-per-game jump from last season. He's also shooting a team-best 66.2% from the field while averaging 5.6 rebounds per game, second to fellow big man Graham Ike.Huff had several impressive games to fuel the Bulldogs' strong non-conference display, including 20 points on 9-for-11 shooting in a win over then-No. 18 Kentucky in early December. A few weeks later, he posted a career-high 37 points in a win over Campbell, and more recently, he had 28 points to lift Gonzaga to an overtime win over Seattle.Gonzaga currently sits at 17-1 (5-0 WCC) on the season with its only loss to Michigan, currently the No. 4 team in the AP Poll. The Bulldogs are a projected No. 4 seed in CBS Sports' Bracketology.\nIf Huff returns on the earlier end of the projected recovery timeline, he'd be back in plenty of time to ramp up ahead of the conference tournament and NCAA Tournament. However, if it's closer to the eight-week mark, things would get tight. Eight weeks from Thursday's news is March 12; the first round of the NCAA Tournament begins March 19.\n            \n    ",

The contract has opt outs after the second and third years, a $64 million signing bonus and $30 million in deferrals, which lowers the present-day value of the contract to $57.1 million per year, according to ESPN. The Dodgers have not yet officially announced the signing.In other words, Tucker has signed the richest contract on an average annual value basis in Major League Baseball history:Kyle Tucker, Dodgers, $57.1 million AAV (2026-29)Juan Soto, Mets, $51 million AAV (2025-39)Shohei Ohtani, Dodgers, estimated $46,081,476 AAV (2024-33)Max Scherzer, Mets, $43,333,333 (2022-24)Justin Verlander, Mets, $43,333,333 (2023-24)\n        \n            \n                Winners and losers of the Kyle Tucker signing: Dodgers, Mets, Blue Jays, Cody Bellinger and more\n                \n                    R.J.

Our Mike Axisa recently broke down why a shorter-term deal would make sense for the All-Star outfielder.The Toronto Blue Jays and New York Mets were believed to be the other top contenders to land Tucker's services, with the Blue Jays offering a long-term deal and the Mets offering a similar contract to the one he signed with the Dodgers, albeit reportedly for less money.\nTucker, 28, hit .266/.377/.464 (143 OPS+) with 22 home runs and 25 stolen bases in 2025 as a member of the Chicago Cubs. For his career, he's amassed a 140 OPS+ with five consecutive seasons exceeding 4.5 Wins Above Replacement, according to Baseball Reference's calculations.\nHere's what we wrote when we ranked Tucker as the best free agent available this winter, ahead of veteran infielders Alex Bregman and Bo Bichette:Bill James once theorized that it's better for a player's perception for them to start hot and finish cold than the inverse -- that way their numbers are more impressive for a longer period of time. Tucker tested that idea. He entered July sporting a .931 OPS, but from there on he posted an ice-cold .690 mark. His downturn seems connected to injuries, specifically the fractured hand he suffered in June. Tucker still produced his fifth consecutive four-win season, so the shape of his year may prove irrelevant to teams seeking a star-level performer who is good at everything (albeit seldom ranked among the league leaders at anything). Tucker joins a star-studded Dodgers roster that last October became the first repeat World Series champions in more than two decades. He figures to slot into an outfield that also features Teoscar Hernández, Andy Pages, and Alex Call. The Dodgers were already projected to have a luxury tax payroll nearing $350 million, according to Cot's Contracts' estimates. They also added top closer Edwin Díaz on a three-year, $69 million contract earlier this winter.\n\n        \n            \n                Predicting the Dodgers lineup with Kyle Tucker: Where does the new outfielder fit for the champions?\n                \n                    Dayn Perry                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMeanwhile, the Cubs will receive draft-pick compensation, having acquired Tucker in a blockbuster trade last winter with the Houston Astros and having extended the $22.025 million qualifying offer. \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        The Los Angeles Dodgers have agreed to terms with outfielder Kyle Tucker on a four-year contract that will pay him $240 million. The resulting $60 million average annual value represents the largest in Major League Baseball's history, surpassing the $51 million AAV Juan Soto received last winter from the New York Mets. The pact reportedly includes opt-out opportunities after the second and third seasons. Tucker, 29 in a matter of days, was regarded by CBS Sports as the No. 1 free agent on the market this offseason. Here's what we wrote back at the onset of the winter:Bill James once theorized that it's better for a player's perception for them to start hot and finish cold than the inverse -- that way their numbers are more impressive for a longer period of time. Tucker tested that idea. He entered July sporting a .931 OPS, but from there on he posted an ice-cold .690 mark. His downturn seems connected to injuries, specifically the fractured hand he suffered in June. Tucker still produced his fifth consecutive four-win season, so the shape of his year may prove irrelevant to teams seeking a star-level performer who is good at everything (albeit seldom ranked among the league leaders at anything). Tucker now joins the Dodgers, MLB's first repeat World Series champion in more than two decades. He figures to slot high into a lineup that already includes All-Star talents like Shohei Ohtani, Mookie Betts, and Freddie Freeman. Tucker will also be part of an outfield alongside some combination of Teoscar Hernández, Andy Pages, and Alex Call.For more on Tucker's signing, let's highlight a few winners and losers of the deal.Winners1. Los Angeles Dodgers\nObviously enough. The Dodgers were already good enough to win the last two World Series and they already entered the offseason as the favorites to win yet another title. Then they inked closer Edwin Díaz earlier this winter to address their biggest weakness.  The Tucker signing, though, elevates them even more. Think about it this way. They'll now field a lineup that includes four of the top 20 position players in the sport, as judged by total Wins Above Replacement accumulated since 2023. That's Shohei Ohtani (second), Mookie Betts (eighth), Freddie Freeman (18th), and Tucker (19th). Only one other team has even three of the top 20, with that being the New York Mets: Juan Soto and Francisco Lindor rank fifth and sixth, and Marcus Semien checks in 17th.That the Dodgers were able to snag Tucker without committing to him for more than two guaranteed years ensures they should avoid any age-related decline. More on that later. For now, they've upped those World Series odds from +370 after Game 7 to +250 (via DraftKings).\n2. AAV-heavy structureIt's long been an accepted truth that top free agents, especially hitters who are in their prime years, are compensated in both term and wage. The Tucker signing helps introduce a new kind of contract that trades length for a more intense payday.The logic on the player's side is straightforward. Not only can Tucker control his own destiny by triggering an opt-out clause after either the second or third season, but he has a chance to walk away with significantly greater earnings this way than if he had signed a 10-year pact worth $300 million (or whatever the accompanying amount would have been). He'll now hit free agency again ahead of his age-33 season (at the latest) with $240 million already in the bank.As for the team, the Dodgers will be able to avoid paying Tucker deep into his 30s, when he's likely to suffer from age-related decline. Yes, they'll have to write a bigger check to cover their luxury tax penalties, but that's a small price to pay when there's a chance to string together three or more World Series titles in a row.\n3. Bellinger and BichetteThe biggest fans of the Tucker signing who don't have a vested interest? Probably free-agent outfielder Cody Bellinger and infielder Bo Bichette.Bellinger is now, clearly, the top outfield bat remaining on the market. He's been engaged with the New York Yankees for weeks now, with the hangup being over the years. If nothing else, Bellinger's camp can point to the Tucker deal in an attempt to fetch a higher AAV, even if it doesn't necessarily come with a longer term.Bichette, on the other hand, had originally had his free agency prolonged by the Blue Jays' interest in Tucker and Alex Bregman. With both signing elsewhere, Toronto can more seriously engage in talks about a potential reunion. That doesn't mean Bichette will return to the only franchise he's played for as a professional, but the chances seem higher now than they were this time a week ago.\nLosers1. New York MetsThe Mets have already drawn their share of criticism this winter. Executive David Stearns allowed first baseman Pete Alonso and closer Edwin Díaz to leave through free agency and traded longtime fixtures in outfielder Brandon Nimmo and utility player Jeff McNeil. Still, it appears that Stearns had a real chance of landing Tucker, putting the wind back in New York's sails by giving them another high-level producer -- and potentially doing it without handing out another extremely long-term commitment.Owner Steve Cohen even raised eyebrows earlier on Thursday evening, sending out a social media post about waiting for smoke.Clearly Cohen wasn't playing coy. In the end, the Mets were outmaneuvered by the Dodgers, who offered $10 million per annum more than the Mets' last reported offer. (It's unclear if New York upped its bid before Tucker made a decision.) Now, if the Mets are to add another piece to their lineup before Opening Day, they'll have to resort to either signing a lower-tier free agent or making a trade.\nThat isn't to suggest the Mets are doomed -- they have plenty of talent in place and a handful of promising youngsters nearing a permanent big-league assignment -- but this isn't the kind of winter they had in mind after collapsing late last season and missing the playoffs.2. Toronto Blue JaysThe Blue Jays have to be tired of being beaten to the punch by the Dodgers. Over the last three years, the Dodgers have snatched free agent after free agent (Ohtani, Roki Sasaki, now Tucker) from Toronto's grasp. If that wasn't enough, the Dodgers also came from behind -- on the road -- to defeat the Blue Jays in last year's World Series.On the bright side, the Blue Jays can still pivot here and re-sign Bichette. They also made a fair number of additions earlier in the winter, landing right-handers Dylan Cease and Cody Ponce, as well as Japanese infielder Kazuma Okamoto.\nTucker would've been a huge get for the Blue Jays. It just wasn't meant to be.3. The rest of baseballBecause the Dodgers are that much better, yes, but also because this ensures there will be more sustained bellyaching about a salary cap. (As if the owners have ever needed an excuse.)The Dodgers, for those keeping score, were already expected to have a luxury tax payroll around $360 million. Depending on the exact terms of Tucker's deal, as well as whatever else they do with their roster, they could exceed $400 million for the second year in a row.Thanks to their 2025 payroll, the Dodgers had to pay more than $169 million in luxury tax penalties, a new MLB record.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        With seconds remaining in the Boston Celtics' 119-114 win over the Miami Heat on Thursday, Anfernee Simons stepped to the line and calmly knocked down two free throws to seal the victory and run his point total to 39 -- a Celtics record for scoring off the bench in a road game, and his highest scoring game with the franchise. Simons, who was traded to the Celtics over the summer in the Jrue Holiday deal, has been the subject of trade rumors for as long as he's been with Boston. And his scoring outburst to power the Celtics' 19-point comeback win showed why he's one of the most intriguing players heading into the Feb. 5 trade deadline. The Celtics entered Thursday's contest in Miami on a two-game losing streak and quickly fell behind by double digits. They were still down by 15 late in the third quarter, and seemed on their way to a third consecutive defeat. Simons had other ideas. Simons had a five-point burst late in the third to cut the deficit to 10 entering the fourth, then took over the final frame. During a five-minute stretch, he either scored or assisted on 17 consecutive points for the Celtics, including a step-back 3-pointer that put them back in front for good. \nThe Heat tried an array of defenders, but none had an answer for Simons, who was creating offense so easily that Jaylen Brown spent much of the fourth quarter standing in the corner. Just look at some of these moves. \nSimons got off to an inconsistent start with the Celtics, but he's been much better lately as he's gotten more comfortable in their system. In January, he's averaging 18.3 points and 3.6 assists on 49% shooting from the field and 51.6% from 3-point range. Though Simons spent the last four seasons as a starter with the Trail Blazers, the last few weeks have shown that he may be best suited to a bench role. When he gets going, there are few better microwave scorers in the league. \nWhy would the Celtics want to trade Simons?Simons has an expiring contract worth $27.6 million, which makes him a perfect trade candidate, especially for a Celtics team that needs a big man after losing Kristaps Porzingis, Al Horford and Luke Kornet last summer. Per Jake Fischer, the Celtics \"have indeed been monitoring the big man market for potential trade options for some time.\"In addition, moving Simons could help the Celtics shed even more money from their books. While their offseason moves got them under the dreaded second apron of the luxury tax, sending out Simons could get them under the first apron or even the luxury tax line altogether. (They're about $4 million over the first apron and $12 million over the tax line.) If the Celtics are uninterested in re-signing Simons this summer, or expect to be priced out, moving him at the deadline could net them a contributor for the future and/or significant savings. Here's Fischer again:\n\"One well-placed observer whispered this week that the Celtics' deadline business -- whether they trade for a big man or not and how significant the trade is -- should serve as a useful hint about their plans for an in-season comeback from Jayson Tatum.\"There is still no timeline for Tatum's return from a torn Achilles tendon, but the six-time All-Star told Chris Haynes last month that he plans to play this season. If Tatum does return, even in a limited role, the Celtics wouldn't have as much use for Simons. Simons' big contract will limit the Celtics' options for dealing him away, but there are plenty of teams that would be interested in him, whether it's as a bench scorer or as a potential lead guard for the future. While he's been in the league for a while now, he's still only 26 years old. \nThe case for keeping SimonsNo one will be all that surprised if the Celtics trade Simons, and if the team was having the season everyone expected, he would almost certainly be gone. But after beating the Heat they are 25-15 as the mid-point approaches and tied for second place in the Eastern Conference with the New York Knicks. Trading Simons to upgrade the frontcourt would be one thing, but with the team looking like a real contender in the East it would be hard to justify dumping his salary, especially with how important he's become lately. The Celtics are now 4-0 when Simons scores at least 25 points and 6-1 when he gets to 20 points. If you zoom out even further, they're 13-5 when he hits 15 points and 8-10 when he does not. As awesome as Jaylen Brown has been, the team still needs a secondary scorer. When Simons provides that boost, they usually win. \n\"I'm a big fan, I like him a lot,\" Celtics president Brad Stevens said of Simons last month. \"He's a quiet guy, but just a super person, and so he's really come in with a great mindset: 'I'm going to help the team any way I can.' And offensively, he knows he's capable of going nuts in any given game.\"Throughout the Celtics' run as contenders, they've largely lacked a player like Simons -- an ultra-quick guard who can easily beat his man on the perimeter, get into the lane and break down a defense. Derrick White and Payton Pritchard offer some of that, but neither is as quick or athletic as Simons. Having him come playoff time would give their offense another dimension. The Celtics would have less need for Simons if Tatum comes back, but having Simons' firepower alongside two All-NBA talents rather than just one would be an incredible luxury. Small lineups with Simons, White, Tatum and Brown would be a nightmare for opposing defenses. It would be worth keeping Simons just to see what he looks like with that group. \nIt's also worth noting that keeping Simons through the end of the season doesn't guarantee that he'll walk for nothing in free agency. They could re-sign him to a more team-friendly deal or possibly sign-and-trade him in the summer. Furthermore, if he leaves in free agency that could open up the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level Exception, per Keith Smith, which would help them add someone else. Celtics in a great spot either wayThe great news for Stevens, Joe Mazzulla and everyone else in Boston is that they're in a win-win situation thanks to how well they've played this season and Simons' recent hot streak. If they trade Simons for a big man they'll bolster their frontcourt -- which, with respect to Neemias Queta and Luka Garza, remains their biggest weakness -- and possibly save money in the process. If they keep Simons, they'll have one of the league's best bench scorers for at least the rest of the season. \nWhatever happens, Simons and the Celtics are going to be one of the most fascinating teams to watch ahead of the deadline and beyond. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Speaking to reporters for the first time since tearing his ACL in Week 15, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes provided a positive update on his rehabilitation and expressed a desire to be back for Week 1 of the 2026 season.\"Rehab's going great so far, just hitting all the checkpoints that the doctor wants you to do and getting the strength and the range of mobility back,\" Mahomes said Thursday on a video press conference. \"So that's been going great, been doing all of it here in Kansas City so far, and [Chiefs athletic trainer] Julie [Frymyer]'s been crushing it, pushing me. The doctor kind of gives you goals to get to, and I try to maximize those, and they hold me back, because I always want to go a little bit further.\"It's been going great. Obviously, I think the long term, I want to be ready for Week 1. Doctor said I could be but can't predict what's going to happen throughout the process, but that's my goal, and so I'll try to prepare myself to be ready to play in that Week 1 and have no restrictions.\"\n        \n            \n                2026 NFL playoffs power rankings: Seahawks top eight remaining teams still vying for a Super Bowl title\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMahomes said he hopes to be able to do \"some stuff\" in OTAs and \"a lot\" come training camp. The star quarterback suffered the ACL late in an eventual loss to the Los Angeles Chargers the same day the Chiefs were eliminated from playoff contention and Green Bay Packers star Micah Parsons also tore his ACL. Speaking to the media Monday, Parsons also said he hoped to be back by Week 1 but \"realistically, probably like Week 3, Week 4.\"\nMahomes said after suffering the injury he initially asked the Chiefs' medical staff if he could put a brace on the knee and finish the game, a request the staff denied.Mahomes also looked back on the season as a whole as Kansas City missed the playoffs for the first time since 2014 (Mahomes was a freshman at Texas Tech that year) and finished the season with a 6-11 record.\"I think just compounding mistakes,\" Mahomes said. \"You make mistakes throughout a game. For myself, I look at some of the red-zone interceptions I threw in kinda bigger moments in the third and fourth quarter of games. That's stuff that I hadn't done in the past. Speaking for myself, just trying to be better in those moments. I think offensively, we weren't consistent enough throughout games. We had stretches in games we played good, we had stretches in the season we played really good, but we gotta be better, and that starts with me and it has to feed throughout the entire offense.\"\nMahomes' 7.1 yards per attempt this season was the third-lowest mark of his career, and his 256 passing yards per game was his second-lowest. \n            ",

    "body": "\nIt's been nearly nine years since the Atlanta Hawks posted a victory in Portland. Head coach Quin Snyder is hoping this is the year the drought finally ends.The Hawks (20-22) conclude their four-game road trip when they visit the Moda Center to take on the Portland Trail Blazers (19-22) at 10 p.m. ET on Thursday. Atlanta has lost its last eight contests in \"The City of Roses,\" last winning when it outlasted the Trail Blazers 109-104 in overtime on Feb. 13, 2017.After beginning their trek with triumphs over the Denver Nuggets and Golden State Warriors, the Hawks were trounced 141-116 by the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday. Portland is looking to avoid a third consecutive setback after losing to the New York Knicks 123-114 at home on Sunday and the Warriors 119-97 on the road two days later.Seven other games are on the NBA's Thursday evening schedule, one of which is a matchup between the Boston Celtics (24-15) and Miami Heat (21-19) at 7:30 p.m. ET at the Kaseya Center. The Celtics have won seven of the last eight meetings between the teams, including a 129-116 home victory last month, and four straight in Miami.There are 10 games on the NHL slate, with one pitting the Vancouver Canucks (16-25-5) against the Columbus Blue Jackets (20-19-7) at 7 p.m. ET at Nationwide Arena. The Canucks, who edged the Blue Jackets 4-3 at home earlier this season, are looking to halt their eight-game slide (0-6-2) as they conclude a six-game road trip.Thursday's busy college basketball schedule includes a Conference USA clash between UTEP (5-11) and Delaware (5-11) at 7 p.m. ET at the Bob Carpenter Center in Newark, Del. The Miners and Fightin' Blue Hens are both struggling as each squad has lost four of its last five contests.The Hawks are 3.5-point favorites against the Trail Blazers in the latest consensus NBA odds, while the Celtics are 2.5-point favorites against the Heat. The Blue Jackets are -168 on the money line against the Canucks and Delaware is a 1.5-point favorite against UTEP.Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Thursday, Jan. 15. All times EasternNBA best bets, where to watchCeltics at HeatTime: 7:30 p.m. | Location: Miami | TV: NBA League Pass | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Celtics -143 | Expert: Derrick White Over 9.5 rebounds + assists (-128, Mike Barner)The Celtics kicked off a four-game road trip Monday with their third loss in four overall contests, a 98-96 setback against the Indiana Pacers. But Boston won eight of its previous 10 games away from home, and the Heat lost three straight and four of five before getting past the Phoenix Suns 127-121 on Tuesday. The SportsLine Projection Model sees the Celtics extending their winning streak in Miami to five games as they emerge victorious in 55% of simulations. SportsLine NBA expert Mike Barner believes Boston guard Derrick White will be a factor both on the boards and setting up his teammates as he has averaged more than five rebounds and five assists over his last 13 games, combining for at least 10 eight times in that span.Hawks at Trail BlazersTime: 10 p.m. | Location: Portland | TV: NBA League Pass | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Trail Blazers +3.5 (-107) | Expert: Nickeil Alexander-Walker Over 20.5 points (-118, Mike Barner)The Trail Blazers have split their 20 home games this far this season but had a nice run of success at the Moda Center prior to Sunday's loss to New York, winning five straight on their own court. Several of those victories came against formidable opponents, as they defeated Boston by six points in late December and beat the Houston Rockets twice in a span of three days last week. They may not hand Atlanta its ninth consecutive loss in Portland, but the SportsLine Projection Model feels the Trail Blazers will keep it close as its simulations have them covering the spread 56% of the time. Barner thinks Hawks guard Nickeil Alexander-Walker will continue to produce offensively, as the 27-year-old has stepped up during the absences of Kristaps Porzingis (Achilles) and Zaccharie Risacher (knee) by scoring at least 22 points in each of Atlanta's last three games.NHL best bets, where to watchCanucks at Blue JacketsTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Columbus, Ohio | TV: ESPN+ | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Under 6.5 (+104) | Expert: Blue Jackets -1 (-111, Matt Severance)The Canucks are one of the lowest-scoring teams in the NHL, as they are tied for 28th with 125 goals. They've had a lot of trouble converting of late, netting a total of five tallies over their last four games and scoring more than once in only one of those contests. Taking that into consideration, the SportsLine Projection Model thinks goals will be at a premium in Thursday's matchup as the Under hits in more than 60% of its simulations. SportsLine expert Matt Severance (26-12-1, +1023.5 on his last 39 spread picks involving Columbus) expects the Blue Jackets to cover the spread as the Canucks will be looking to finish their six-game road trip without any injuries as an eight-game homestand awaits them.CBB best bets, where to watchUTEP at DelawareTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Newark, Del. | TV: ESPN+ | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Over 127.5 (-107) | Expert: Delaware -1.5 (-110, Larry Hartstein)Neither team is an offensive powerhouse as both are among the bottom three in scoring in Conference USA. Both also give up a fair amount of points, with the Miners allowing an average of 72.6 and the Fightin' Blue Hens permitting 70.8 per contest. The SportsLine Projection Model doesn't see either squad shutting down the other in this matchup as its simulations have the Over hitting 85.5% of the time. SportsLine expert Larry Hartstein (6-0 on his last six ATS picks involving UTEP) is backing a cover by Delaware as the Miners are 0-6 away from home and have lost their last three conference road games by double digits.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Sam Darnold has been labeled as questionable for Saturday's divisional round playoff matchup with the San Francisco 49ers. The Seattle Seahawks' starting quarterback was added to Thursday's injury report with an oblique injury. Darnold confirmed that the injury occurred during the routes on air portion of Thursday's practice. He said he felt some discomfort on his oblique on the left side and decided not to take any risks regarding practice. \"Didn't wanna push it,\" he said after practice. \"Wasn't the day to push it. That was it. Came inside, got some rehab, and feel like I'll be ready to go for Saturday.\"Darnold said that there is a \"very low percentage\" that he isn't on the field for Seattle's first playoff game. \"Probably closer to zero,\" he said with a slight smile. Darnold, 28, has been a big key to Seattle's success this season under second-year coach Mike Macdonald. Following a Pro Bowl season with the Vikings last year, Darnold was named to his second straight Pro Bowl this season after throwing for over 4,000 yards and 25 touchdowns in helping lead the 14-3 Seahawks to the NFC's No. 1 seed for the postseason. \nDarnold split his two starts this season against the 49ers, throwing for less than 200 yards in both games and not throwing a touchdown pass. He didn't throw any interceptions in those games either while completing 73.5% of his passes. \nIf Darnold isn't able to play, the Seahawks would turn the keys of the offense over to Drew Lock, who during Thursday's practice received reps with Seattle's first-team offense. Lock, 29, is a former second-round pick who attempted just three passes during the regular season. He does have 28 career regular season starts under his belt that includes 13 starts in 2020, his second season with the Broncos. \"Drew's been really impressive throughout OTAs and training camp and in his role,\" Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak said following Thursday's practice. \"Started a lot of football games, 28 games in the league. Lot of confidence in Drew. Brought him here for a reason.\" While Lock will have to be ready, Darnold has made it clear that he fully expects to be on the field while making his second career postseason start. \n\"We'll attack it the next couple of days and be ready for Saturday,\" he said. \n            ",

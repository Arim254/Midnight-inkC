    "body": "\n        Las Vegas Raiders wide receiver Jakobi Meyers requested a trade in the offseason, and while the team did not move him before the season started, nothing has changed with regard to his desire to play elsewhere. Meyers said ahead of Week 8 that he \"for sure\" still wants to be traded, even though the Raiders reportedly had no interest in shipping him off at the start of the year.The NFL trade deadline is just over two weeks away, and there is still seemingly no momentum in a potential Meyers deal. A number of teams could benefit from adding the veteran receiver if he becomes available ahead of the Nov. 4 deadline, though. Wideout-needy teams like the New York Giants and Pittsburgh Steelers could be buyers, and the New England Patriots are familiar with Meyers and could potentially use another weapon for breakout quarterback Drake Maye.\"I'm a professional at the end of the day,\" Meyers said Tuesday. \"I'm just trying to play good football. If I'm here, like I said, I'll play good football. If I'm not here, I'll go out there and play wherever I'm supposed to be.\"\n        \n            \n                Jakobi Meyers landing spots: Where could veteran WR wind up if Raiders trade him before deadline?\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMeyers' August trade request came after his search for a new contract came up short. He is in the final season of a three-year deal he signed with the Raiders in 2023, and his stock could not have been higher in the offseason as he was fresh off a career year in which he racked up 87 catches for 1,027 yards and four touchdowns.\nThe sides did not reach an agreement on an extension before the season began, halting the discussions.\"That window kind of closed when the offseason ended,\" Meyers said. \"I'm just focused on being where my feet are. If it gets done, I don't care, for real. I just want to be in a good spot for me, for my family, and like I said, really just play good football.\"The Raiders, who are 2-5 and in last place in the AFC West, will have to determine how expendable Meyers is before making a decision on whether to trade him at the deadline, to re-sign him before or during free agency or to let him walk at the end of the year. With the offense struggling under first-year coach Pete Carroll, Meyers has not been quite the leader of the wideouts that he was last year when he finished second only to tight end Brock Bowers in receiving, but he still ranks in a tie for first place on the team with 29 catches.\nFellow receiver Tre Tucker emerged as the Raiders' most productive pass-catcher from both a yardage and touchdown standpoint with Bowers missing time this season due to injury.\n            ",

The Hilltoppers have scored at least 27 points in all five of their wins, so last week's offensive output was an outlier.

    "body": "\n        When Marcus Rashford moved on loan from Manchester United to Barcelona over the summer, the deal felt more like an exercise in convenience more than anything else. The Red Devils needed to rid themselves of Rashford, both in pursuit of a new rebuild in their never-ending series of them, and because Rashford's career at his boyhood club was essentially dead and buried after receiving the ire of fans and club legends alike. Barcelona was a glamorous but practical landing spot – the cash-strapped club did not have a transfer fee to worry about, while their pre-existing attacking talent meant there was only so much pressure on Rashford. After years of being the next big thing and then the poster child for wasted talent, the player would finally have a chance to slide into normalcy.So much for that.Rashford may not be Barcelona's most important player, but two months into his spell at the club, he is charting an unlikely redemption arc as one of the team's most effective attackers. He now has five goals and four assists in 13 games, adding a brace to his tally with a 6-1 win over Olympiacos in UEFA Champions League action on Tuesday and now leads the competition for goal contributions with five. His second Champions League brace of the season offered the latest glimpse of the revitalized player, especially his second goal in the 79th minute – he tucked himself just behind a defender and as soon as Pedri received the ball in a crowded midfield, he threw his hand forward to call his teammate's attention. Pedri obliged with a perfectly placed pass and Rashford wasted little time following up with an equally excellent finish on the edge of the penalty area.\nHe offers more in terms of end product these days than he did during his last full season at United during the 2023-24 campaign, his goals per game average up from 0.2 to 0.4 and his assist numbers up from 0.1 to 0.3. His shot-taking is also up from an average of two per game to 3.3 this season, but the most dramatic differences in his game are saved for the underlying statistics. He is much more involved in play, averaging 44 touches and 26.4 passes per game these days, more than the 36.8 touches and 22.8 passes he had per game during the 2023-24 season at United.\nRashford is emerging as a more well-rounded player than he once was, with manager Hansi Flick describing his brace at Newcastle United on Matchday 1 as the \"first step\" in his Barcelona evolution. \"Our style, how we want to play, is focused on high intensity and this is what I want to see also from him,\" Flick said at the time.As he learns to play the Barcelona way, though, he is more than just a useful player for the team at a crucial point in the season. Rashford has been able to put goals in the back of the net while both Robert Lewandowski and Raphinha deal with injury, allowing Flick to rely on others to ensure Barcelona's attack remains their greatest strength. The team is averaging 2.7 goals per game in LaLiga this campaign, the exact same average from last season, with a different cast of characters pitching in – Rashford has played a part, as has this season's leading goalscorer Fermin Lopez, whose hat trick against Olympiacos brings him up to eight goals across all competitions.The team's overall success in attack provides some optimism ahead of Sunday's Clasico at Real Madrid, where they will still be without Raphinha and Lewandowski as they look to overtake their rivals for top spot in LaLiga. Barcelona's depth is definitely strong enough to get the job done on most days, Flick's side the favorites to win in more games than not, though the question facing last season's domestic double winners is if they can handle their stiffest test of the season so far without two of their most talented players. Rashford may earn a start in El Clasico because of Raphinha and Lewandowski's absence, which may be a litmus test of his true potential as the 27-year-old enters his peak years, especially in the midst of an impressive run of form.\nEven if Barcelona come out of El Clasico with a defeat, there is a version of events on Sunday that will not necessarily reflect poorly on Rashford. It would be no insult to admit that Lewandowski is a better choice to lead Barcelona's front line than Rashford but in a new setting, the England international has already reset expectations for what his career should be, not could be. He may not be the star on one of Europe's top teams but to play a sizable role on one of them is no small feat and as the oldest starter in Barcelona's youth-focused lineup against Olympiacos, there's a growing sense of professionalism that makes up Rashford's profile. It may be early in the season but as long as Rashford trends in this direction, his stint at Barcelona feels like enough to recalibrate his reputation, even if he cannot extend his stay at the end of his loan.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Heading into Champions League play, Luis Enrique, the manager of reigning champs PSG, reflected on what took place in last season's final, a 5-0 win over Inter, and what's to come.\"The first title is always difficult because the players don't think they're capable of winning it. But we showed the way,\" said the Spanish coach. \"Now, the whole of PSG and the young players want to win because they know they're capable. For me, it's harder to win the first than the second or third.\" Following an away trip to Bayer Leverkusen on Tuesday, where they won 7-2, he may be correct in that declaration. It was a topsy-turvy match with both teams going down to 10 men, but with PSG growing a three-goal lead by halftime, you'd assume something like an Ousmane Dembele hat-trick got them to that point, considering he scored an eye-watering 35 goals last campaign. But he wasn't in the starting XI after returning from a hamstring injury that has kept him out since the end of August. Neither was two-thirds of the midfield that won that title, with Fabian Ruiz and Joao Neves both missing out with injuries. \nDembele did enter the match during the second half and only needed three minutes to show why he was the Ballon d'Or winner, giving PSG a four-goal advantage, but now, after three matches, PSG sit atop the Champions League league phase table with three wins, 13 goals scored, and only three conceded. Bayern Munich or Real Madrid can catch them on Wednesday, but as teams are getting into the swing of UCL play, it's clear that PSG are among the favorites, if not the favorite, to win the competition again, filled with not only incredible talent but tremendous depth.\nOn Tuesday, 20-year-old Desire Doue led the line, scoring a brace, while 19-year-olds Warren Zaire-Emery and Senny Mayulu paced the midfield. This is a deep squad, and the experience these young players are gaining will be invaluable in the long run for their development. Teams have to fill in for injuries all the time, but few can do it at the level that Enrique's men can. They're already on the right path to direct qualification for the round of 16, and they haven't hit top gear yet. With contenders such as Liverpool and Barcelona showing defensive concerns, Real Madrid looking to find their footing under a new manager, and Napoli struggling on their return to Champions League play, it only aligns things better for PSG to win a second consecutive title. That doesn't mean it will be an easy road with Manchester City, Arsenal, and Bayern Munich all performing at a high level, but you can see where Enrique's words come from.\nLast season, there was pressure on his team to deliver something that had never been done in PSG's history, and while there's still pressure to win things now, knowing that they can do it and having the weight lifted from their shoulders makes it easier to play. Enrique has been an excellent tactician to have his team prepared as well. Goncalo Ramos said that Harry Kane showed him how to beat Barcelona's offside trap, and the attention to detail by this club is second to none.With Dembele sidelined, contributions have come from everywhere, with four players scoring two goals in UCL play so far, and no player accounting for more than two goals. Six players scored their seven goals on the night, showing how unselfish this team has been under Enrique. What used to be a collection of stars who came together to chase European glory and failed became a team who will be tough to stop by anyone in their path, just like last season showed. With Dembele back, even more so.If PSG are showing that injuries can't stop them in their chase to repeat as European champions, no one may be able to stop them but themselves.\n            ",

This is Arizona State's first such fine of the year. \"The Big 12 prioritizes the safety of all players, coaches and officials,\" Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark said in a statement. \"The conference will continue to work with all of its institutions on event management policies at all Big 12 venues.\" Arizona State, on the heels of a blowout loss to Utah, rebounded by handing Texas Tech its first loss of the season. As a result, Arizona State returned to the AP Top 25 poll at No. 24 following its win over the Red Raiders, who dropped from No. 7 to No. 14. \n        \n            \n                Texas Tech's loss to Arizona State puts double-digit teams in play to reach the Big 12 title game\n                \n                    Chris Hummer                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Sun Devils led by 19-7 entering the fourth quarter, but a 15-point scoring run from Texas Tech saw it go in front with just 2:00 remaining in regulation. Arizona State quickly responded as running back Raleek Brown rushed for a decisive 1-yard touchdown with 34 seconds left on the clock. The Sun Devils' defense then prevented a last-second Hail Mary attempt to preserve a 26-22 win. \nFans took to the field inside Mountain America Stadium shortly thereafter.  The Big 12 has been cracking down on any sort of intrusions to the playing surface this season. It recently fined Texas Tech $25,000 for \"repeated instances of objects being thrown onto the playing surface\" in relation to the fan tradition of throwing tortillas onto the field following in-game kickoffs. \nThe conference has threatened further punitive measures for any tortilla-related incidents, including an in-game penalty and a six-figure fine.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        When the 2025-26 NBA season tips off with a doubleheader Tuesday night, they'll be doing so with the most international talent on rosters in league history. There is a record 135 international players on rosters as the season opens, which represents roughly 30% of the total players in the NBA. It's the clearest example of basketball's ever-expanding global interest, and as more international talent enters the NBA, the league continues to try and tap into that expanded market.Each year, the NBA holds international games both in the preseason and regular season. The 76ers and Knicks just got back from a pair of games in Abu Dhabi. The Orlando Magic and Memphis Grizzlies will head to Berlin and London for a pair of games in January. Orlando has a trio of German players on their roster in brothers Franz and Moritz Wagner, and Tristan da Silva.But holding games overseas is just small potatoes compared to what future plans the league has on deck. NBA commissioner Adam Silver has already detailed plans of an NBA Europe league that could start in 2027 or 2028. There's still much to figure out about that concept, but certainly one of the biggest thoughts that comes to mind is will this new league compete with the NBA in nabbing international talent? Silver doesn't seem too concerned about that possibility.\"I think if some of those international players decided to either end their career or prolong their career a bit by playing in Europe, I think that would be fantastic,\" Silver said on \"The Pat McAfee Show.\" \"I think for the foreseeable future, the NBA is so big, is so global, the pay is so high. I think it's highly unlikely that any of these players would choose to forego the NBA to play in Europe, and I think that's kind of the case right now.\"\nGiven that the concept of the European league is still new, certainly there's no danger of the NBA losing any of its top international talent in the first few years of operation. But we know how much pride these international stars have for their home country. There's been reports that Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo plans on moving back to Greece as soon as he retires. Three-time MVP Nikola Jokić spends pretty much all his free time in Serbia during the offseason riding -- and racing -- his horses. Luka Dončić is an ambassador for Slovenian tourism.\n        \n            \n                Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo reveals he doesn't want to end his basketball career in Milwaukee\n                \n                    Chris Bengel                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThat's not to say these guys will leave the NBA immediately with the creation of NBA Europe because, like Silver said, the amount of money to be made in the NBA is difficult to beat. But whose to say the next generation of international players won't opt to play in the NBA's European league? Or two generations from now? Silver said there's already been ownership interest from \"a lot of well known wealthy European families, American families and institutions,\" who would like to see this take off, so if you manage to find a league's-worth of owners with deep enough pockets, you could certainly start to rival the compensation the NBA is offering.We already know the interest in basketball is there. It's is the second-most popular sport across Europe behind soccer, and Silver mentioned the NBA alone has 50 million fans in the continent. The issue has been the resources and marketing poured into the sport over there. But with the backing of the NBA and everything that comes with it -- money, marketing, infrastructure -- there's real potential to create a league that's capable of replicating what we have in America right now. \nIt won't be immediate, but if that happens, you'd have to think that would be a very appealing option for some international stars down the road. That could create a problem for the NBA later on, as they wouldn't be the only league vying for the top talent in the world. They'll control both leagues so they'll reap the benefits either way, but splitting the talent pool across two leagues feels like finding a solution for a problem that doesn't exist.\n            ",

Top NBA DFS picks such as Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Luka Doncic, Stephen Curry and Jimmy Butler are ready to tip off the season, while an old face in a new place will make his Rockets debut in Kevin Durant.

Doncic will take part in his first NBA Opening Night in a Lakers uniform, and he'll do so without LeBron James (sciatica) alongside him. If preseason was any indication of what Doncic could do without James available, then Doncic would justify his NBA DFS price tags as he led NBA Preseason in scoring. That came after a dominant run with the Slovenian National Team at EuroBasket this summer as he averaged the most points by any player at the event in over 35 years.The five-time All-Star is just as productive in NBA games that matter, as his 28.2 points with the Lakers last season were slightly more than what he averaged in Dallas to begin the year. Doncic has to be thrilled that a matchup with the Warriors takes place on NBA Opening Night, considering his best game of the 2024-25 season came versus the Warriors. In a late December game, he had a 45-point triple-double, filling up the box score with 13 assists, 11 rebounds, three steals and two blocks.New users can see the latest FanDuel promo code to get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:Another part of McClure's optimal NBA DFS strategy includes rostering Thunder center Isaiah Hartenstein ($5,400 on DraftKings and $5,800 on FanDuel), who has a points + rebounds + assists combo line of 23.5. In his first year in OKC, Hartenstein posted career highs across the board. He averaged 11.2 points, 10.7 rebounds, 3.8 assists and 1.1 blocks while knocking down 58.1% of his field goal attempts. He has some extra motivation to face Houston on Tuesday as the Rockets were his original team before unceremoniously cutting him after two seasons.It certainly shows that revenge is a motivating factor for Hartenstein as he saved some of his best performances for the Rockets last year. His 16 ppg versus Houston were his most versus any team (min. two games), and the Rockets' shooting woes allow opposing big men to pile up rebounds. Houston was bottom-10 in both field goal percentage and 3-point percentage a year ago, and while Durant will help solve some of that, there should still be plenty of defensive rebounds to grab for Hartenstein on Tuesday. See McClure's other NBA DFS picks right here.How to set your NBA DFS lineups for Tuesday, October 21McClure is also targeting a player who could go off for massive numbers on Tuesday because of a dream matchup.

    "body": "\n        A number of survivor pool players have seen their hopes disappear, but for those few still alive, Week 8 of the NFL schedule leaves them with several solid options. Week 7 didn't feature as much carnage as previous weeks, as most of the favorites earned wins, including the Kansas City Chiefs with a 31-0 win over Las Vegas, and the New England Patriots with a 31-13 win over Tennessee. A slight hinderance to players is the fact that six teams will be on their bye in Week 8. Among the likely targets for NFL survivor players this week include Dolphins at Falcons (-7), Bears at Ravens (-6.5), Bills at Panthers (+7.5), Jets at Bengals (-6.5) and Browns at Patriots (-7).Meanwhile, the Indianapolis Colts look to cruise to the AFC South title. Indianapolis (6-1) has a two-game lead over second-place Jacksonville within the division. Indianapolis will look for the season sweep of Tennessee. The Colts rolled to a 41-20 win over the Titans in Week 3. Indianapolis enters as a 14-point favorite, the largest line of the week, so the Colts are among the many appealing options for those who can still use them.

However, Chicago has defeated Baltimore in two of the last three matchups overall and four of seven in the all-time series.The Bears have been on a roll with four consecutive wins. Caleb Williams has completed 61.1% of his passes with 1,351 yards and nine touchdowns with three interceptions and a 92.9 rating, to lead the Chicago offense.

    "body": "\n        Five of the biggest names in women's college basketball earned recognition Tuesday when the Associated Press unveiled its 2025-25 preseason All-America team, including UCLA center Lauren Betts and Notre Dame guard Hannah Hidalgo. Those two stars earned the most votes from the AP's 31-member panel with 29 apiece.Betts guided UCLA last season to the first Final Four appearance in program history with a breakout individual campaign. The former Stanford transfer became the first National Defensive Player of the Year to hail from UCLA and was a scoring weapon on the other end of the floor at 20.2 points per game. Betts blocked 100 shots on the year, made strides as a passer and scorer and amassed 19 double-doubles to assert herself as one of the top frontcourt players in the country.Hidalgo is a reigning National Player of the Year finalist who in the 2024-25 season set the Notre Dame single-season scoring record with 23.8 points per game. She hit the ground running as one of the top freshmen in the sport the year prior, picked up where she left off last season and figures to shoulder even more of the load for the Fighting Irish this winter as the lone returning starter in the lineup.UConn sophomore forward Sarah Strong earned the third-most votes of the preseason All-Americans with 28. She led the reigning national champion Huskies in rebounds (356), steals (92) and blocks (66) and picked up a National Freshman of the Year honor after enjoying one of the best seasons by a first-year player in UConn's storied history.\n\n        \n            \n                Ranking the 10 best women's college basketball players for 2025-26: Sarah Strong, Lauren Betts lead list\n                \n                    Isabel Gonzalez                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMadison Booker, a junior forward at Texas, is the last of four players to earn at least 20 preseason All-America votes. The sharp-shooting SEC Player of the Year converted from beyond the arc at a scalding 40.3% clip last season, which helped her become the second-fastest player in Longhorns history to reach the 1,000-point threshold.South Carolina senior guard Ta'Niya Latson rounds out the All-America roster. Latson, who starred last season at Florida State, was the nation's leading scorer as a junior with 25.2 points per game. She moved to the SEC this offseason as the headliner of the 2025 transfer portal cycle, and her arrival is among the numerous reasons why the Gamecocks open the year as the No. 2 team in the preseason AP Top 25.\n2025-26 AP preseason All-America teamPlayerTeamVotesLauren BettsUCLA29Hannah HidalgoNotre Dame29Sarah StrongUConn28Madison BookerTexas23Ta'Niya LatsonSouth Carolina14Others receiving votes: Azzi Fudd, UConn (11); Olivia Miles, TCU (10); Flau'Jae Johnson, LSU (4); Mikayla Blakes, Vanderbilt (3); Raegan Beers, Oklahoma (2); Jazzy Davidson, USC (1); Darianna Littlepage-Buggs, Baylor (1)\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 NBA season is officially at hand, and it's missing a key character. For the first time since the 2018-19 season, LeBron James is absent from the festivities. This is the first season opener he's ever missed, and his Lakers have been a fixture on opening night ever since their 2019 acquisition of Anthony Davis. He's not the only significant name we won't see on Tuesday. Obviously, the Houston Rockets will be without Fred VanVleet as he'll likely miss the season recovering from a torn ACL, and the Oklahoma City Thunder are missing key forward Jalen Williams. The season hasn't even begun and we're already missing several important players. Alas, we soldier on without them, as their teams now must. The Rockets, Thunder, Lakers and Warriors will tip off the 2025-26 season on Tuesday, even if they have to do so at least at full strength.   Where to watch NBA opening night Game times: Thunder vs. Rockets, 7:30 p.m. ET | Lakers vs. Warriors, 10 p.m. ETTV channel: NBC | Live stream: fubo (Try for free), PeacockOdds (via DraftKings): OKC -258, HOU +210, O/U: 227.5 | GSW -142, LAL +120, O/U: 226.5So, with the season set to tip off, let's pick some best bets for Tuesday's slate with odds provided by DraftKings Sportsbook.  Houston Rockets at Oklahoma City Thunder We're kicking off the season with last year's No. 1 and No. 5 ranked defenses, so there's going to be a temptation to lean under here. That's especially true with Houston starting a jumbo lineup with Kevin Durant at shooting guard, and the inevitable emotions of ring night pouring over into the game. Keep in mind, though, these teams played five games last season. The lowest-scoring of them came in at 207. The other four came in at 233, 235, 236 and 265. For whatever reason, these defenses can stop everyone but one another. The absence of Williams will be felt fairly acutely for the Thunder defensively, as he was the obvious Durant matchup. They have a ton of other viable perimeter defenders, but their one weakness is height. That's a problem against one of the tallest wing scorers in league history, and both teams will generate easy points off turnovers, which tend to be plentiful early in seasons when offenses are sloppier. The Pick: Over 227.5. \nI'll admit I'm tempted to pick Houston to cover the seven-point spread. The Rockets beat the Thunder twice last season and it's opening night -- we want drama. But I just can't get over the danger of starting Amen Thompson as a point guard in his first game without Fred VanVleet around as a security blanket against this, specific Thunder team. I have all the faith in the world in Thompson eventually being a point guard-level handler and creator. It should even happen this season. But right away, against the best turnover-generating defense ever on the road with a raucous Oklahoma City crowd? I just think that's the difference here. Thompson will get there. I don't think he's quite ready for the role he'll have to play right away. The Pick: Thunder -7 Big news, NBA fans. The all-new DraftKings promo code gives new users three free months of NBA League Pass and $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager. Get started here.

NBA League Pass users can also use multi-view features to stream multiple games at the same time, making it even easier to watch your favorite players,  teams, NBA bets, or Fantasy basketball lineups. Claim your offer now: It wouldn't be a Rockets game without a rebounding prop. I'm operating under the assumption that Alperen Sengun, for offense's sake, with Houston playing this jumbo lineup, just isn't going to be able to leave the floor much. Steven Adams and Clint Capela will come and go, but the Rockets are playing big, which probably means their shooting is going to be suboptimal. This is the best offensive rebounding team in the NBA, and I'm expecting them to reaffirm that on opening night. The Pick: Alperen Sengun Over 8.5 Rebounds \n \tGolden State Warriors at Los Angeles Lakers An opening night home underdog that has the best player in the game? Yes please. Luka Dončić has had a reasonably successful regular-season record against the Warriors at 14-8. Their defense, imposing as it is against the right opponents, struggles most with heliocentric offensive stars because they lack a single, elite perimeter defender. If you're a Deandre Ayton optimist, you'd figure that this would be a game for him. He has meaningful size and athletic advantages over Golden State's older, smaller front court of Al Horford and Draymond Green. Ironically, missing LeBron may not be the worst thing for the Lakers in this one. He's 1-6 in season openers as a Laker. The Pick: Lakers +2 Well, if you expect a big Dončić game, you almost have to pick the over. Even if a big Dončić game is a relatively slow one, the Lakers have a long way to go defensively, and the Warriors are exactly the sort of team you don't want to play on opening night in that regard because of how crisp their passing and movement are. Stopping them means having good habits and communication, which the Lakers likely don't yet have with all of their new faces. The Pick: Over 225.5 \nI'm not overthinking the props here. This is skinny Luka against a defense without a perimeter stopper. He's going to have the ball basically all night with James out. I can't promise the most efficient game out of Dončić, but I have to imagine he brute forces his way to 31 points. The Pick: Dončić Over 30.5 Points \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Steven Pearl knows the narrative of how and why he's the head coach of an Auburn basketball program that just made the Final Four a year ago. A former Tennessee forward turned medical sales professional turned two-hour, sports-talk radio show host on the Tennessee Sports Network turned assistant coach turned defensive coordinator turned … head coach of the reigning SEC regular-season champions? It's a tongue-twister that just doesn't happen in this era of college basketball, where some razor-sharp basketball minds spend decades toiling in anonymity without earning an opportunity like this.\"I'm fully understanding of the fact that my situation is so unique and so much different than anyone else's,\" Pearl told CBS Sports' Jon Rothstein on Inside College Basketball Now. \"I understand that may rub people the wrong way. I get that the main reason why I had this job is because of who my dad is. But we also have an unbelievable staff who is deserving of this opportunity. It's way less about me and more about them.\"Will it work? That's the million-dollar question for an Auburn program where expectations have skyrocketed in the past decade. When Bruce Pearl took the gig in 2014, only TCU was in worse shape at the high-major ranks. Nowadays, Auburn can lose seven of its top eight players from the best team in school history, have its coach abruptly retire and still maintain expectations to compete for a SEC title again.\nThe big-picture stuff is daunting, but the day-to-day grind for Bruce Pearl's son, Steven Pearl, has completely changed after his dad's decision to step down. It's Talking Season in college basketball circles, and Steven Pearl isn't immune. Steven Pearl's phone has been buzzing off the hook, fielding calls from Auburn higher-ups, donors, players, parents and decision-makers. Recruiting doesn't stop, either. Oh, and Auburn scrimmaged Oklahoma State just hours after taking part in SEC Media Days last Wednesday. Steven Pearl is a self-described \"numbers nerd\" who wants to live on Synergy Sports, but he suddenly has a jam-packed schedule with way more than just basketball X's and O's to tackle.\n\"I didn't feel as prepared as I usually do,\" Steven Pearl said. \"As an assistant, all you do is watch film. You feel like you can have a great grasp of what they're doing. Part of it is we only had 18 minutes of game film. For me, that's an adjustment. That's something I have to adjust in my schedule to watch more film, break down more film to help our guys be more successful.\"\n        \n            \n                Who is Steven Pearl? What you need to know about Auburn's new basketball coach after Bruce Pearl's retirement\n                \n                    Kyle Boone                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAuburn, which enters ranked 20th in the country, fell to Oklahoma State in overtime of that exhibition, flashing both what makes the Tigers so tantalizing and also a potential mercurial group. Auburn's defense, predictably, looked shoddy in its first showing without the brilliant Dylan Cardwell and Johni Broome, but the offensive potency of Tahaad Pettiford and Keyshawn Hall will give defenses trouble all year. Those two killer lefties can get isolation buckets in their sleep, but Steven Pearl was eager to get back onto the practice floor after spending hours in the film room.\"I have 74 clips to show the guys today,\" Steven Pearl said. \"I think a lot of the mistakes we made are correctable. It wasn't a lack of effort, it wasn't a lack of energy, it was just a lack of attention to detail as far as knowing which way these guys like to drive.\"\nHall and Pettiford will drive this team, but Pearl has built a roster with real juice on the margins. Division II transfer Elyjah Freeman is a legitimate NBA prospect. Texas Tech transfer Kevin Overton is a two-way veteran guard who will help this club. KeShawn Murphy is a fantastic connective big man who can pass, dribble and shoot. Even freshman forward Sebastian Williams-Adams immediately showed why he's going to be a major part of this rotation with a six-point, nine-rebound showing against the Pokes.\"Just continue to be so impressed with him,\" Steven Pearl said. \"He's just a physical specimen. I love what he brings from a toughness and energy standpoint. He's just got to find ways to have his motor run the entire time he's out there and not take a few possessions off. He's going to be an important X-Factor for our group.\"\nThe vision of another tournament team is clear and obvious, but this new-look group has to coalesce under a first-time head coach.It's a massive undertaking and good or bad, Auburn will be a national storyline because of Bruce Pearl's last-second decision to retire before accepting a job as analyst on CBS Sports, and all but hand his son the job.Is he ready for it?\"All the things you hear from your head coaching buddies are true,\" Steven Pearl said. \"It's a little bit lonelier at the top because there's not a lot of people that sit in that seat.\"\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    AuburnUndercover has the most experienced experts and insiders covering the Tigers on the ground in Auburn.

The conference-leading Pistons host the Knicks at 7:30 p.m. ET, as New York tries to extend its eight-game winning streak and gain ground in the NBA standings. Detroit is coming off a surprising loss to Washington, but SportsLine's proven computer model is backing the Pistons to win on Friday.

Bet it at bet365 here:Pistons (-170) vs. Knicks\nDetroit is coming off a loss to Washington as a 17-point favorite on Thursday, but the Pistons are still the top team in the Eastern Conference. They had won 12 of their previous 15 games and are wrapping up a four-game homestand, while the Knicks are coming off a double-overtime thriller against Denver. Guard Jalen Brunson was among three New York players who saw at least 47 minutes of action in the second game of a back-to-back. The Pistons have won four straight meetings between these teams, and SportsLine's model has them winning in 67% of simulations on Friday night. Back the Pistons at bet365 here:Celtics (-225) vs. Heat\"Will eat this number and go big -- anchor leg if need be (will buy out if any Boston key person out). It's high but probably should be another 50 cents higher,\" SportsLine expert Matt Severance said. \"Still no Tyler Herro for the Heat, who did nothing at the deadline to stay mediocre. At least the Bulls got like a cacophony of second-round picks. Maybe they find the next Nikola Jokic in Round 2. LOL. Then trade him probably. And I think one of those Bulls' traded guys, Nikola Vucevic, makes the Celtics that much better. He solves a few of their issues. Could the Heat win? Obviously, but I am kinda puttering along in the NBA so I need to get going. But I usually take off post-break.\" Back the Celtics at bet365 here:Bucks +1.5 vs. Pacers (-110)Indiana is tied for last place in the Eastern Conference, as the Pacers have been unable to overcome the absence of superstar guard Tyrese Haliburton. The Pacers dealt Bennedict Mathurin, Isaiah Jackson and three draft picks to the Clippers for center Ivica Zubac and forward Kobe Brown. Former Pacer Myles Turner is averaging 18 points and seven rebounds in the last five games for Milwaukee. Additionally, Kevin Porter Jr. returned from an oblique injury in an overtime win against New Orleans on Wednesday, and he is one reason why Milwaukee is covering the spread 62% of the time. Back the Bucks at bet365 here:\nLooking for more NBA betting picks?You've seen the model's best bets for Friday.

UConn is already 2-0 in MSG this season with wins over Illinois and Florida and Hurley is currently boasting an 11-2 record over his last 13 games in the arena.\" Bet UConn to win at DraftKings here:Pistons (-170) to defeat the KnicksThe model isn't too concerned about Detroit's 126-117 home loss to the lowly Wizards on Thursday, as it may have been the classic case of looking ahead to a showdown the following day. The Pistons have the best record in the East at 37-13, and the Knicks are tied for second at 33-18.

The Pistons defeated the Knicks, 121-90, on Jan. 5 in Detroit in their first meeting this season, and the model sees value in betting New York's eight-game winning streak to end on Friday. The Pistons are 20-6 at home this season, while the Knicks are 11-12 on the road. The model projects the Pistons to win in 67% of simulations. Bet the Pistons to win at DraftKings here:Celtics (-5.5) vs. Heat (-118)The Celtics have won four straight games to improve to 33-18, with only the Pistons having a better record than them in the East. Guard Jaylen Brown has proven capable of being a team's Alpha as Brown ranks fourth in the league in scoring at 29.5 points per game, including back-to-back games with at least 30 points. Derrick White had 28 points in Boston's 114-93 win over the Rockets on Wednesday, with 7-footer Neemias Queta playing as a force inside with 19 rebounds. His size can challenge Bam Adebayo and Miami as the Heat are coming off a 127-115 loss to the Hawks on Tuesday.

    "body": "\n        At the beginning of this week, the WNBA and WNBA Players Association had an in-person meeting to discuss the new collective bargaining agreement. It was the first in-person meeting between the two sides in months.Per reporting by ESPN and Front Office Sports, about 40 players and more than a half dozen team owners and executives were present at the meeting. On Friday, CBS Sports spoke exclusively to one of the players who attended the meeting via Zoom: Elizabeth Williams, the secretary of the WNBPA.Williams is currently in Europe, where she is playing for Galatasaray of the Turkish Women's Basketball Super League during the WNBA offseason. The 32-year-old center was the fourth overall pick in the 2015 draft and has been a longtime member of the WNBPA executive committee. She most recently played for the Chicago Sky, but like all but two veterans in the WNBA, is currently a free agent.The WNBPA opted out of the current CBA at the end of the 2024 season. While the CBA originally expired on Oct. 31, 2025, the league and union agreed to two extensions. But on Jan. 9, when the second extension expired, the two sides entered a period of status quo, meaning the conditions of the current CBA remain in place, but either side can enact a work stoppage at any time. In December, the union voted to authorize a strike \"if necessary.\" \nDespite the ongoing stalemate, the WNBA released its 2026 schedule in late January. At the time, a WNBA spokesperson told CBS Sports that the schedule release was \"a key step as we prepare for the WNBA's 30th season and allows teams, partners, broadcasters and fans to begin the essential planning for the year ahead.\" Training camps are supposed to open on April 19, and the first game is scheduled for May 8, just over three months away. The league still needs to hold free agency, the college draft and, perhaps most importantly, expansion drafts for the two newest WNBA franchises, the Portland Fire and Toronto Tempo.The main point of contention between the league and players is the revenue-sharing model and salary structure. In the league's most recent proposal, players would get about 70% of net revenue, which is the revenue remaining when league-specified operating expenses are removed from the pot. The union countered that offer with a proposal that would see the players get about 30% of gross revenue, which is all team and league revenue, before expenses.The WNBPA sent its latest proposal to the league in late December. The league has yet to counter that proposal, and did not bring one to the meeting on Monday, which reportedly frustrated players. When the two sides left the meeting on Monday, the WNBA made it clear that the league understood it was its turn to respond, and that a new proposal was coming soon. As of publication, the WNBPA has still not received a proposal from the league.\nOn Friday afternoon, Williams spoke to CBS Sports about what led to the meeting, how she felt the meeting went, reports of discord in the union's executive committee, the possibility of a strike, her faith in leadership and whether she believes a deal will be done by the end of this month.The following interview has been edited for length and clarity.Gibbs: I know you were at the meeting on Monday via zoom. I know some players have expressed frustration that the meeting didn't start with a proposal from the league. Was that something that surprised you? And how did you feel the meeting went?Williams: Yeah, I was a little surprised by that, especially knowing that players were going to be there in person. I think just having something would have been better than nothing. I do think as the conversation went on and the league side and ownership side could hear from people in person and hear the tone of why these issues matter, I think that that helped the conversation, and I think it facilitated the level of urgency that's needed. So that was my initial reaction to how it went.\nGibbs: You use the word urgency. And I think from the public, it's felt like there's been a lack of urgency, maybe on both sides. You know, we're now in February, and getting so close to the season. How do you feel? Have you felt the sense of urgency on the player's side, and is that escalating as the clock continues to tick?Williams: Yeah. I mean, I think the urgency is there on our side. I don't think we would have had that meeting in person if the urgency wasn't there. I think that was like an explicit moment of, 'OK. I think you really need to see us to understand where we're coming from and why we need to come up with this deal ASAP.' And I think the league has kind of operated from a place of comfort and complacency in the sense that they released the season schedule without our CBA being negotiated, like they're just very confident in what they've put out. And I think that's where the disconnect was. After that, I think players really were like, 'OK, the urgency is there from our end.' And they just seem to think like that, everything is fine without us agreeing.Gibbs: So you felt that the schedule release was a tipping point for the players, maybe that you all felt disrespected by that?\nWilliams: I think that's fair to say, because I mean, I think it's bold to put out a schedule without having anything agreed on. You have teams putting out schedules, and these teams don't have players on them. That's kind of mind-boggling to me. And so it said a lot about where they stood and in the negotiations and feeling like they weren't really going to budge. And I think after this meeting on Monday, that's not the case at all. I think there is room for movement, and I think on both sides, I mean, I think players are willing to move on certain things that maybe the league wasn't at an understanding of before, and so maybe that's like, just a reminder, like we're still negotiating in good faith. And that's going to help us move forward.Gibbs: Do you feel like they took you all more seriously after this meeting on Monday?Williams: Yeah, I would say so.Gibbs: What misconceptions do you feel like people have about what the players are asking for?\nWilliams: I think there's a misconception about, like, how much the league is losing moving forward. Because when you talk about the investment that has gone into the league, when you talk about the valuations of teams, when you talk about expansion fees, all of these things that the league might not consider, like traditional revenue, it's still dollars that are coming in. I don't think you would see the pace of expansion if the league wasn't growing. And so I think there's just a misconception on our understanding of that and how that is going to impact our salaries and kind of everything moving forward.Gibbs: There's a narrative that is coming out that the players are asking for so much that it's going to handicap the league, that it's going to shut down the growth, and that maybe the players don't understand how much owners are spending and how much it is costing to run the WNBA. How do you respond to that?Williams: I don't think we're being irresponsible. I think that's kind of what that translates to me too. Players are being irresponsible, like they're asking for this amount of money, blah blah. I don't, I don't think it's that at all. I think there are plenty, plenty of areas of revenue opportunities for the league and for the teams. I think at the end of the day, the product is most important, and I think the product is continuing to grow. There's a lot of young talent, and that's what brings in fans and excites fans. And there's also still the fact that this league has existed for 30 years, there's a fandom that's here that is going to continue to be built on. And so I think all of those things, all the opportunities for revenue to come in, like, I really don't think that we're being irresponsible in how we are presenting, you know, what we think we should be getting.\nGibbs: Caitlin Clark was on NBC this week, and she talked about how this isn't just a big moment for the WNBA, it's a big moment for all of women's sports. And I wondered how much you think about this as not just a movement for your league, but a movement for women's sports and maybe women's labor rights in general?Williams: I agree. I mean, it's kind of wild, especially considering how transformational the last CBA was right for us, and now this moment is that times 100, you know? And I think there's that understanding, and I think that's why our leadership is being so intentional in how we communicate in the meetings that we have with the league and the meetings that we have with players. We're just in this age where, like, you can see everything. And so there's an understanding, like, if this labor is being put in, and you see these dollars coming from TV, see these dollars coming from investment, from expansion, like everyone can see that. Why isn't it reflected in salaries? And so I think this CBA is like, going to be that example for sports, of course, but just for women in general, if the work is being put in and the signs are there, then it needs to be reflected period. And that's the time that we're that we're living in.\nGibbs: I think we first talked, and it was probably 2016 you know, you've been in the league for so long, you've played so many different roles – you've been the all star, you've been the veteran, you've been starter, you've been coming from the bench, you've been on so many teams. How have you personally experienced the growth of the league, and what kind of most surprises you about the growth you've seen in the past decade?Williams: Oh, man, there's so many changes. Sometimes it's hard to like, I think we joke about in the locker room with [Maddy Westbeld and Hailey Van Lith] sometimes. So just like even sharing, just sharing rooms on the road, right? Like, that's something that a lot of people just seem to forget, like we were doing that you had to do that until you were in your sixth year, and then going from that to, like, selling out 20,000 seats for like arenas, for a regular-season game, for like the travel, obviously, the charters, yeah, and just Just overall, the growth from the fans, too. I think it's just been like, It's been huge. So all of those, all of those things are big. And I think, I don't know, I think people just care more. People are watching more. They're paying attention. People are inspired like I think about 2020 and how the impact that we had with, Say Her Name, with Black Lives Matter. And Senator Warnock. Like all of that comes from, yes, like the product on the floor, but the type of impact that we have off the floor. And so I think all of that is kind of reflected in how we've been approaching this negotiation too. We do things together. We're committed to doing things the right way and doing what we believe is right. So, yeah, it's just been, it's been nuts to see how much the league has grown, and like deservedly so.Gibbs: Caitlin Clark also said she thought that in the next few weeks there would be a deal done. I know [Breanna Stewart] had previously said she thought one could get done by Feb. 1. Obviously that didn't happen. It can be hard to answer, because it's not in your control. But how, how confident are you that a deal will get done this month?\nWilliams: I mean, I would hope so, given that free agency was supposed to start on the first but again, I think the fact that as of now, that another proposal hasn't been sent, that's not ideal. So I don't know, I'm just I've been using the phrase cautiously optimistic for a very long time, but I still remain that way because, I mean, I'm still confident that in in our staff and in our advisors, that that that we're still in a position that a deal will get it done. So as of now, like, Yeah, I'll continue to use cautiously optimistic as my phrase.Gibbs: Are the players still ready to strike if necessary?Williams: I'll say we didn't have the strike authorization vote for nothing. So we're in a position, obviously, if we need to strike, we will. But as far as like, actually voting on it, it's we're kind of relying on our staff and our advisors. If they're like, 'Hey, I think this is time to have that, that vote or that conversation.' And as of now, they haven't advised us to do so. So that's where we stand as far as a strike is concerned. I think if the conversation changes with leadership and with legal counsel, and they say, Hey, this is where I think the conversation should shift, okay, then we can talk about the vote, but ultimately we have the strike authorization vote in our back pocket if we need it, and then obviously the [Executive Committee] can talk about striking if necessary.Gibbs: But you know from talking with other players -- like the players want to play, you know this is a big season, and you know, you want to keep the momentum going. Is that fair to say?\nWilliams: Definitely fair to say. People want to play. There's not a question like, players want to play. Yeah, we just want to make sure we get it right. So that's it.Gibbs: I'll let you have the final word. If there's anything I didn't ask or anything you want to communicate?Williams: I mean to the fans like we see them, you know. We see them supporting us, and we appreciate their patience with us and with this process, they're patience with the league, too. It matters to us, and they matter to us like we as much as we all want to play, and we also want to play for the fans like that's a big part of the WNBA is the fandom and the people that have been with us from the beginning. So we're doing what we can, we're not sitting here resting, you know, there are things that we can move on, and we've communicated that, just like the league has things that they can move on. We want to play and we're but we also want to put current players and future players in a position where they've gotten the best deal that they could possibly get.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Imagn Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Former Washington Commanders offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury is joining the Los Angeles Rams' coaching staff, ESPN reported on Friday. Kingsbury spent the last two seasons with Washington. He oversaw the development of quarterback Jayden Daniels, the 2024 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year, as the Commanders advanced to the NFC Championship but parted ways with the franchise after a 5-12 record in an injury-plagued 2025 season.Kingsbury and Rams coach Sean McVay had been speaking for the last two weeks about the partnership, according to ESPN. After Kingsbury didn't land the offensive coordinator job with the New York Giants, the path was clear for him to head back to the West Coast. Kingsbury's job title for 2026 is unclear at the moment, but the Rams have a vacancy at offensive coordinator after Mike LaFleur was hired by the Arizona Cardinals last week. The Rams lost to the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC Championship but received good news Thursday night when quarterback Matthew Stafford announced his return for his 18th NFL season during his MVP acceptance speech. \n\n        \n            \n                Three voters turned NFL MVP race upside down: How Justin Herbert and Josh Allen helped Matthew Stafford win\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBefore returning to the NFL as an offensive coordinator in 2024, Kingsbury served as a senior offensive analyst under Lincoln Riley at USC. Before that, Kingsbury was the coach of the Cardinals for four seasons, finishing with a 28-37-1 record during his lone stint as a head coach in the league. Kingsbury also had a six-year run coaching Texas Tech, his alma mater. He amassed a 35-40 record during that span and led the Red Raiders to three bowl games. Kingsbury, 46, interviewed for the vacant coaching jobs of the Baltimore Ravens and Tennessee Titans earlier this cycle. The Ravens hired former Los Angeles Chargers defensive coordinator Jesse Minter, while Tennessee tabbed San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator Robert Saleh as the next coach.\nWith Kingsbury, the Rams are adding another respected offensive mind to their staff. Los Angeles passing game coordinator Nate Scheelhaase was a coveted name in the coaching carousel, but will stay with the team. McVay said this week that an \"extensive search\" for LaFleur's replacement will take place with \"in-house candidates\" in contention for the offensive coordinator role. \n            \n    ",

The Americans certainly have the team to compete for another gold medal thanks to a collection of proven Olympic veterans and rising stars, and they will look to keep their strong start going on Saturday against Finland. The Americans were dominant to open Olympic play on Thursday with a 5-1 win over Czechia. Hayley Scamurra led the way with two goals, team captain Hilary Knight went top shelf late in the second period to extend the lead to 4-1 and Aerin Frankel stopped 13 of 14 shots in net to help the Americans open Olympic play on a positive note.\nAlong with Canada, Team USA is one of just two countries that have won gold in women's ice hockey since the event was added to the Olympics in 1998. The Americans won that inaugural year in Nagano, then endured four straight Canadian victories until 2018, when Team USA struck back with a dramatic overtime win to capture gold in Pyeongchang.Team USA is poised to retake its place atop the international hockey hierarchy, and it enters the Olympics as the favorite to win gold. According to FanDuel Sportsbook, it's another two-horse race between the U.S. (-155) and Canada (+115), at least on paper. The next closest gold medal contenders are Czechia (+6000) and Sweden (+6000).As is typically the case, the Americans have put together a roster that's loaded at every position, and there's a good mix of experience and youth. Knight is making her fifth Olympic appearance, and star Kendall Coyne Schofield will make her fourth Olympic appearance. Defenders Megan Keller and Lee Stecklein are also familiar with the Olympic stage. Meanwhile, rising stars Taylor Heise, Carlone Harvey and Laila Edwards are getting their first taste of Olympic action.The Americans continue this Olympic journey with a matchup against Finland on Saturday, and we'll keep you up to date with each result along the way.\nU.S. women's hockey scheduleAll times EasternPreliminary roundThursday, Feb. 5: USA 5, Czechia 1 USA vs. Finland | Saturday, Feb. 7 | 10:40 a.m. | USA NetworkUSA vs. Switzerland | Monday, Feb. 9 | 2:40 p.m. | USA NetworkUSA vs. Canada | Tuesday, Feb. 10 | 2:10 p.m. | USA NetworkQuarterfinalTBD vs. TBD | Friday, Feb. 13 | 3:10 p.m. | TBDSemifinalTBD vs. TBD | Monday, Feb. 16 | 10:40 a.m. | TBDBronze medal game\nTBD vs. TBD | Thursday, Feb. 19 | 8:40 a.m. | TBDGold medal gameTBD vs. TBD | Thursday, Feb. 19 | 1:10 p.m. | TBD\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

Both the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots have concluded their slate of practices and are now simply waiting to kick off Super Bowl LX on Sunday. With these on-field preparations now in the books, we also have a final look at the health statuses for both franchises as they've released their final injury reports of the week. Coming into Super Bowl week, the injury storylines surrounding both of these clubs centered on their quarterbacks. Sam Darnold had been nursing an oblique injury, while Drake Maye had been working through an injury to his right throwing shoulder. Their situations cleared up as the week progressed, but there was some concern for Seattle defensive back Nick Emmanwori, who suffered an ankle injury this week at practice. Below, we'll provide an update on Emmanwori and reveal the game statuses for both Seattle and New England.Seattle Seahawks (-4.5) at New England PatriotsSunday, 6:30 p.m. ET on NBC, streaming on PeacockTeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusSeahawksRobbie OuztsFBNeckQuestionablePatriotsJoshua FarmerDLHamstringQuestionableHarold LandryLBKneeQuestionableRobert SpillaneLBAnkleQuestionableSeahawks: The most notable development for Seattle is that Emmanwori carries no injury designation, meaning he will play on Super Bowl Sunday despite that ankle injury. After missing Thursday's session, Emmanwori was back in the fold Friday as a full participant. Offensive tackle Charles Cross was also upgraded to a full participant after being limited at the start of the week, so the Seahawks are quite healthy coming into this matchup. \nPatriots: New England is also pretty healthy. All eyes were fixated on Drake Maye, but the second-year quarterback opened up the week as a full participant at practice, and that remained the case through Friday. He has no injury designation, meaning he is good to go. Linebacker Robert Spillane is listed as questionable after missing Wednesday's practice and being limited on both Thursday and Friday, but has been adamant when speaking to reporters this week that he'll suit up. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Olympic champion speed skater Erin Jackson and bobsledder Frank Del Duca will represent Team USA as flag bearers at the Opening Ceremony of the Milano Cortina Winter Games after being chosen by fellow Team USA athletes through a voting process. They will become the second American duo to share the honor at the Winter Olympics.Jackson is the ninth speed skater in U.S. history to bear the flag and follows Brittany Bowe, who replaced bobsledder Elana Meyers Taylor to open the 2022 Beijing Winter Games after the latter tested positive for COVID-19. Del Duca is the sixth bobsledder selected for the role and, because of Meyers Taylor's absence four years ago, will be the first in 70 years to carry the flag at an opening ceremony.This is the second consecutive Winter Olympics in which Team USA selected two flag bearers.The Opening Ceremony will air live in the United States at 2 p.m. ET on Friday. Follow along with our live coverage of the Opening Ceremonies, including all the incredible musical performances and the walk of nations. \nWho is Erin Jackson?Jackson, 33, made her Winter Olympic debut in 2018 at the Pyeongchang Winter Games. Her breakthrough came four years later when she became the first Black American woman to medal in speed skating and the first Black woman to win gold in an individual sport. Her 500m speed skating victory at the Beijing Winter Games snapped a two-decade drought for American women atop the speed skating podium.\"Being chosen to represent the United States on the world stage is a tremendous honor,\" Jackson said. \"It's a moment that reflects far more than one individual -- it represents my family, my teammates, my hometown, and everyone across the country who believes in the power of sport. The Olympics remind us of the power of sport to connect and inspire, and I'm proud to carry that forward on the Olympic stage.\"\n        \n            \n                2026 Winter Olympics: Team USA athletes to watch, medal favorites, potential breakout stars in each sport\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nJackson hails from Ocala, Florida, and graduated from the University of Florida. The longtime roller skater had just four months of experience in speed skating on ice when she qualified for the 2018 Winter Olympics. Since then, she has accumulated six medals on the world stage.\nWho is Frank Del Duca?Del Duca, 34, will make his second Winter Olympic appearance this month after debuting at the Beijing Games. The bobsled pilot finished 13th in the two-man and four-man competitions in 2022.\"Being flag bearer for Team USA is an incredible honor,\" Del Duca said. \"It was also quite the surprise. I'm grateful for the support from my teammates, coaches and staff, Team USA, U.S. Army WCAP, family and friends, and everyone who has helped me on this journey. With the Olympic Games being held in Italy, it means even more. Nearly everyone in my family is of Italian descent.\"There is no greater honor than leading Team USA into the Opening Ceremony in Italy. It feels like a bridge between my family's heritage, and the country I'm so proud to serve. I know my grandfather is watching over me saying, \"Hey, Frangesch, way to go kid,\" and would be so proud.\"\nAfter winning the high school state championship in alpine skiing, the Bethel, Maine, native walked on to the University of Maine track and field team. He attended a bobsled combine after college and joined the U.S. Bobsled team as a push athlete, and after missing out on a selection for the 2018 U.S. Olympic Team, he moved to the pilot position.\n            ",

Boston held Alperen Sengun, who is 10th in the league in rebounding at 9.4 per game, to nine rebounds in its last game on Wednesday. Adebayo went Under this total in both games against the Celtics this season, including securing just four rebounds over 33 minutes in their last matchup on Jan. 15.

    "body": "\nThe Super Bowl 60 matchup is set, with the New England Patriots representing the AFC and the Seattle Seahawks coming from the NFC. You can make Patriots vs. Seahawks picks well before the kickoff on Sunday, Feb. 8, and it's fitting these are the only two teams left to make NFL bets on. That's because they boast the two best spread records this year, with Seattle at 14-5 and New England at 13-6-1. However, that also means they aren't making it easy to make 2026 Super Bowl predictions which such a small ATS margin between them.Seattle is favored by 4.5 points (O/U 45.5) per the latest Super Bowl odds from DraftKings Sportsbook. Underdogs have covered 52.6% of the time in Super Bowl history, which is close to the flip of a coin, so that Super Bowl spread trend may not help much with your Seahawks vs. Patriots bets.

Go to SportsLine to see them all now.Top Super Bowl expert picks from Micah RobertsRoberts, a former Vegas bookmaker, is 11-4 (+658) over his last 15 Patriots ATS picks. For Super Bowl 60, Roberts is backing Seattle (-4.5) to cover.\"The Patriots went 9-0 in away games, and the Seahawks went 8-1 in road games. Seattle won nine games in a row, with the last five games being against playoff teams and covering the last four. Drake Maye has looked shaky over the last few weeks, as has his offensive line. The Seahawks were No. 1 in the NFL against the rush number, 6th in total yards allowed (293.4), and No. 1 in total points (17.1) allowed. The real betting hasn't begun. I think this line moves through 5 and 5.5 quickly and closes 6.\" See all of Roberts' picks here, and new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:\nTop Super Bowl props from Todd FuhrmanA Vegas insider who shared first place in the inaugural Circa Survivor contest, Fuhrman is 14-6 (+440.5) over his last 20 NFL player props picks. For Super Bowl LX, he is backing Seahawks RB Kenneth Walker III Under 77.5 rushing yards (-125).\"New England's run defense is damn stout with the return of Milton Williams and I don't expect that to change in two weeks. Kenneth Walker is being asked to take on a bigger workload in the absence of Zach Charbonnet however we saw his effectiveness wane against the Rams as his touches increased, Walker is a dynamic playmaker and he'll be leaned into for sure although it might be more as a receiver than runner vs this Pats defense.\" See the rest of Fuhrman's picks here, and bet that prop here:\nTop Super Bowl predictions from Matt SeveranceSeverance has returned $2,010 for $100 bettors over the last two NFL seasons and is 10-3 (+842.5) over his last 13 NFL picks. He is backing the Under (45.5) in Patriots vs. Seahawks.\"It is an outdoor game so maybe we get some elements in Santa Clara. But giving Mike Macdonald two weeks to prepare for sack- and fumble-prone Drake Maye makes me think Seattle will keep that New England offense in check. That offense did very little in the AFC title game. And I'm sure the Pats' defense will have some surprises for Sam Darnold, too. Our model has 44 points.\" See the rest of Severance's picks here, and bet the total here:\nHow to make 2026 Super Bowl picksSportsLine's team of experts also includes Brady Kannon, a former SuperContest winner who enters Super Bowl LX on a sizzling 29-15 run (66%) on NFL picks, returning over $1,200 for $100 players. You can find out who his NFL picks are for the Super Bowl 2026 here. If you are looking for NFL picks, NFL props, or NFL best bets for Super Bowl 60, SportsLine has you covered with its proven team of experts.

    "body": "\n        The Philadelphia 76ers traded Jared McCain to the Oklahoma City Thunder before Thursday's deadline, and, generally speaking, their fans aren't thrilled. \"They can go f--- themselves,\" Spike Eskin, co-host of The Rights To Ricky Sanchez, said at the beginning of the latest episode of the podcast.\" He then added, \"This is worse than I could have imagined.\"The anger is not just about the Sixers' decision to send a talented young player to the reigning champs. It's about them ducking the luxury tax and not improving the roster for the stretch run, which is exactly what Joel Embiid said he hoped they wouldn't do.At a press conference on Friday, Morey explained the front office's side of the story. He said he understands the negative reaction, and said it was the result of people being excited about the team. He also argued that the McCain trade was the right move at the right time and that they would have been a taxpayer if the situation had called for it.'We were trying to add to the team'Morey's front office traded McCain to Oklahoma City for a 2026 first-round pick (via Houston), a 2027 second-round pick (the most favorable of OKC, Houston, Indiana and Miami's picks) and two 2028 second-round picks (OKC's own and Milwaukee's). After that, they salary-dumped Eric Gordon and signed Dominick Barlow, who'd been a major contributor on a two-way, to a standard contract. That does not mean, however, that this is all the Sixers wanted to do.\n\"Because we're playing well, we were trying to upgrade the team and add to the team now,\" Morey told reporters. \"That was goal No. 1. Obviously, no deal materialized, including using the picks we got from the Jared deal. That's why we did that move a little early. We were trying to reuse those draft picks to add now.\" Throughout the press conference, Morey reiterated that Philadelphia had tried to be a buyer. It offered the picks it got from the Thunder \"to many teams,\" he said, but was unable to turn them into a difference-making player.\"We were trying to add to the team, and we didn't find a deal that made sense, that we thought could move the needle on our ability to win this year,\" Morey said.\nThe McCain deal is fascinating, though, because the beginning of his career has been ... unusual. He was the No. 16 pick in the 2024 draft, and on opening night last season he didn't check in until garbage time. Weeks later, he was the bright spot in a Sixers season that was falling apart due to injuries. In addition to being a lethal shooter, he was thrust into a playmaking role, and he scored 20-plus points in seven straight games, establishing himself as the favorite for Rookie of the Year. Then he suffered a season-ending knee injury, and, during a workout just before this season's training camp, he suffered a thumb injury. While coming back from those injuries in Year 2, McCain has averaged just 6.6 points and shot just 38.5% from the field, fighting for minutes on a deeper, healthier roster that now includes VJ Edgecombe and Quentin Grimes. He started to find his form in late January, but, if you're against the trade -- and if you believe what he did in November 2024 is more meaningful than what he's done this season -- you could argue that Philadelphia sold low.Morey would disagree. \"I am quite confident we were selling high,\" he said. \"Obviously, time will tell.\" He added that the Sixers \"weren't looking to sell,\" but teams came to them with \"aggressive offers.\" In terms of McCain's trade value, \"the only higher point would have been during his run last season,\" Morey said.\nThe package of picks that Philadelphia received, Morey said, is more than the typical return \"for a starter-quality player on a good team.\" He did not trash McCain -- in fact, he called McCain \"a great future bet and a potential great player\" -- but argued that the team is in a better position with the picks than it was with McCain. This, and not cutting payroll, he said, was the primary reason for the trade. And while he thinks this year's draft class is a good one, it wasn't necessarily about getting another prospect, either. They could use the second-rounders to move up in the draft, he said, but they could also move that first-round pick to add a proven player.\"This just gives us more tools to make the moves that we think will help our future more than we saw Jared, who we gave up, but that's not a comment on Jared,\" Morey said. \"That's just, literally, we think, given our team, this was the right move to set us up down the road in a better way.\"Morey said that McCain's path to a bigger role in Philadelphia was \"a little muted relative to where his path could be on another team.\" In other words, if he continued to play around 17 minutes per game, how long would other teams continue to value him like a starter?\nOn a related note, Morey said that the Sixers have talked to Grimes' representation \"quite a bit\" lately, describing him as \"a tremendous fit with our other guards.\" Grimes signed the qualifying offer as a restricted free agent last summer, but Morey said they hope to re-sign him when he's an unrestricted free agent.'I took his comments to heart'Morey knows Embiid wanted the front office to do more than duck the tax at the deadline, and he's heard the criticism directed toward ownership.\"I understand the perception,\" he said. \"I hope to defeat it by finding a deal that I can go to ownership and say, 'We think this move is the right move to do for that and create the apron issues that it would create.' But I haven't been able to recommend that move yet.\"\nTo be clear, the luxury tax and the aprons are different things. Put simply, if a team goes over the first or second apron, it becomes subject to team-building restrictions. If a team goes over the luxury tax, it simply has to pay the luxury tax.Morey said that the Sixers kept their top players, Embiid obviously included, updated about moves and potential moves leading up to the deadline. \"I think we all wanted to add to the team, and I took his comments to heart,\" Morey said, insisting that the problem was not an unwillingness to be a luxury-tax team, but a lack of trade options that justified being a luxury-tax team.\"For sure, if we had found an add and we were going to end up higher, we would've ended up above it,\" Morey said. \"We've done it several times when I was here. Over the history of ownership, they've done it many times. We didn't see something that did that.\"\nPhiladelphia has two open roster spots and could still add a player in the buyout market. \"We've had a lot of conversations already,\" Morey said. It could also convert Jabari Walker's two-way to a standard contract. Morey repeatedly emphasized, though, that the Sixers are happy with the roster they have.\"We like our chances in the East,\" he said. \"We feel like we're in the mix with the top teams there. Obviously, we gotta prove that on the court, but yeah, I'm just reiterating: Yeah, we were hoping to add, and we didn't add, but we still believe in this team.\" Elsewhere in the East, the Cleveland Cavaliers effectively swapped Darius Garland, De'Andre Hunter and Lonzo Ball for James Harden, Dennis Schrôder and Keon Ellis. The Detroit Pistons effectively turned Jaden Ivey into Kevin Huerter. The New York Knicks effectively turned Guerschon Yabusele into Jose Alvarado. The Boston Celtics traded Anfernee Simons for Nikola Vučević. Without naming any of these teams specifically, Morey said he doesn't think anybody meaningfully improved its title odds.\n\"Folks have speculated on the improvements of our East competitors,\" Morey said. \"I don't see it, it personally.\"\n            ",

New England famously won Super Bowl 49 on a fabled goal-line interception, but both teams are much different now. Bill Belichick was on the sidelines for the Pats back then while Tom Brady was under center. Now, former New England star Mike Vrabel is wrapping up his first season as the team's head coach while getting great quarterback play from second-year star Drake Maye. As for Seattle, gone are Pete Carroll and Russell Wilson and in are Mike Macdonald and Sam Darnold. Both quarterbacks have been in the spotlight not just with their play, but due to injuries ahead of Super Bowl 60. Now, both teams have released their final official injury reports on Friday, Feb. 6. Here, we break down the biggest Super Bowl injuries for bettors to know and share what the latest NFL betting odds look like at DraftKings Sportsbook for Super Bowl 60. For more Super Bowl 60 betting analysis and expert picks, visit SportsLine.Super Bowl 60 injuriesSeattle Seahawks vs. New England Patriots (Sunday, Feb. 8 at 6:30 p.m. ET)NE QB Drake Maye (right shoulder and illness, no injury designation)NE LB Robert Spillane (ankle, questionable)NE LB Harold Landry (knee, questionable)NE DT Joshua Farmer (hamstring, questionable)SEA S Nick Emmanwori (ankle, no injury designation)SEA FB Robbie Ouzts (neck, questionable)\nAll in all, both teams are in really good shape on the injury front entering the weekend. Both teams presented good news on Friday as New England didn't list star quarterback Drake Maye with any designation, and the same is the case for Seattle's standout rookie safety Nick Emmanwori. Maye was limited at times with a shoulder injury and even missed practice last week with an illness. Emmanwori suffered an ankle injury at practice on Wednesday and didn't practice Thursday, but he was a full participant on Friday. Additionally, Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold, who has been dealing with an oblique injury this postseason, was a full practice participant Thursday and Friday after being limited throughout the playoffs. Two Patriots starters on defense -- linebackers Harold Landry and Robert Spillane -- are questionable to play, as is rookie defensive tackle Joshua Farmer. Spillane had 97 total tackles this season and was limited Thursday and Friday while Landry had 8.5 sacks in the regular season and was limited Wednesday and Friday but didn't practice Thursday. For Seattle, starting rookie fullback Robbie Ouzts is questionable with a neck injury that caused him to miss the NFC title game. The Seahawks are 4.5-point favorites in Super Bowl 60 over the Patriots, and the total is 45.5. Seattle is a -230 money line favorite (wager $230 to win $100) while the Patriots are +190 underdogs (wager $100 to win $190). The Seahawks are 14-5 against the spread this year and are 10-9 to the Over. The Patriots are 14-6 against the spread and 12-8 to the Over. Both teams finished the regular season with 14-3 overall records. \n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                                            ",

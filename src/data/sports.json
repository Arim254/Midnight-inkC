    "body": "\n        For the eighth time in promotional history, the UFC will present a fight card on Saturday from Mexico City. And, for the fifth time since that relationship began, former two-time flyweight champion Brandon Moreno will be featured prominently on the card. Moreno (23-9-2), a native of Tijuana who now lives and trains out of Las Vegas, became the first Mexican-born champion in UFC history when he captured the promotion's 125-pound title by submitting Deiveson Figueiredo in 2021, which was their second of four title bouts against one another in the history of their exciting rivalry. The 32-year-old Moreno will look to return to title contention and bounce back from a December TKO loss to Tatsuro Taira when he headlines UFC Fight Night inside Arena CDMX in the proud nation's capitol city. Moreno, who will face late replacement Lone'er Kavanagh (9-1) will also be fighting with the plight of his people in mind following days of unrest throughout the country. On Sunday, the Mexican government announced the capturing and death of powerful cartel leader Nemesio Ruben Oseguera Cervantes, commonly known as \"El Mencho,\" which set off a wave of retaliatory violence in major cities. \n\"I was walking yesterday in the streets and I stopped to watch my cellphone at all the bad news around the country,\" Moreno told CBS Sports HQ on Monday. \"Right now, in Mexico City, things here are super calm. All of the disaster is more to the north like Guadalajara and Puerto Vallarta. Actually, my [home] city has reports of some destruction on the streets in Tijuana, that's the northwest. Thank life and thank God, my family is fine and the people all around me are fine. \"It has been really hard hours for my Mexican people. It's weird, man. It's crazy because, right now, I'm super focused on my fight but, at the same time, I know that a lot of Mexican people are focused on this bad moment. Maybe [the UFC Fight Night event] can be a nice moment for the people to try to forget the bad moment and get some joy.\"\nThe site of Saturday's card, in central Mexico, is located more than a six-hour drive away from the center of the unrest in the Mexican state of Jalisco, where citizens and tourists have been told to shelter in place. The U.S. State Department declared Tuesday that the majority of areas outside of Jalisco have \"returned to normal\" and UFC Fight Night will go on as scheduled. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Robert Whittaker is ready for a change of scenery. The former middleweight champion is planning to cross the bridge to light heavyweight. Whittaker, 35, has long contemplated a move to 205 pounds. The 20-pound leap is significant, but Whittaker prefers risk to regret.\"I'm going to give it a go,\" Whittaker told Submission Radio.  \"I know a lot of naysayers, a lot of things on the Internet  saying 'small this, small that.' Shut up, dude. I want to give it a go.  I'm on the tail end of my career, so I got to try rather than just  thinking about what ifs.\" Light heavyweight gives him another chance at reinvention. Whittaker originally cut his teeth at welterweight, where he won the Australia vs. England spin-off of \"The Ultimate Fighter\" titled \"The Smashes.\" He had mixed success in the UFC before moving up to middleweight. Whittaker started his middleweight campaign at 8-0, capturing and defending the middleweight title in the process. Lately, he's unsure if middleweight is bringing the best out of him.\n\"I've  been playing with the idea for a long time,\" Whittaker said.  \"During  the break, I was training at a heavier weight. I want to lock  in and  move into this weight division. There's no doubt in my mind I  could  make middleweight. I can make it still, I can lose the weight,  but I  just don't know if I'm getting the best out of myself, having to  cut that  weight. The camp performance kind of really suffers on the  back end of a  weight car,d and a lot of fighters can testify that.\"  Whittaker is eyeing a June return in his new weight class. He needs time to acclimate to light heavyweight, especially coming off consecutive losses for the first time in more than a decade.\"I  want to give myself the appropriate amount of time to really get all  the gears going again,\" Whittaker said. \"Especially if I'm moving up to  205, I want to adjust to the weight. I want to perform at the weight. I  want to build some muscle, etc. I want to give myself like a decent leg  of work, like a good four months to prep and come in there at my best.\"\nWhittaker is one of the best middleweights of all time. He beat many of his contemporaries in prime, including Yoel Romero, Ronaldo \"Jacare\" Souza and Kelvin Gastelum. \"The Reaper\" is coming off a submission loss to Khamzat Chimaev and split decision loss to Reinier de Ridder.More UFC newsUFC 327 is taking shape.

    "body": "\n        Running back Breece Hall is scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent this offseason, but the New York Jets are adamant about keeping their top ballcarrier on the roster. If the sides cannot come to an agreement on a contract extension in the next week, general manager Darren Mougey said the Jets will use either a franchise tag or transition tag.Given the Jets' struggles last season and Hall's looming free agency, the four-year veteran was widely viewed as a prime candidate to be moved at the trade deadline. Instead, he stuck in New York and could be poised to play another year with the franchise that selected him with a second-round pick in 2022.\"The tags are an option,\" Mougey said at the NFL Combine. \"Ideally we'd find a way to get a deal done and keep Breece around. I think I've said that for the last year since I've got here. Breece is a good player. Want to find a way to keep him around. We've been going through that process and are still doing so. We have a week to find out -- if we can't get to an agreement -- which way we'll go with that tag.\"The deadline to use one of the tags is March 3. That gives the Jets one week to sign Hall to a new deal before paying $14.5 million on a franchise tag or $11.7 million on a transition tag.While a lack of team success throughout Hall's career leads to questions about whether the running back would be willing to re-sign with the Jets, Mougey said he believes there is mutual interest in sticking together. That suggests the sides could still get a deal done before March 3.\n\"I do get the sense that Breece wants to be here,\" Mougey said. \"We've had good conversations throughout the season, after the season. So just finding a way to do that.\"Hall would be among the NFL's top free agents if he hit the open market. Instead, signs point to him returning to the Meadowlands in some capacity. The most reasonable path to Hall landing on a different roster in 2026 is if the Jets use the transition tag on him, a running back-needy team extends an offer and New York declines to match.While the Jets have been mired in mediocrity since Hall's arrival in 2022, the Iowa State product remains a bright spot on the roster and one of the most valuable players around which New York could build. In the three years since a torn ACL halted a stellar rookie season, Hall has been a model of consistency, playing in all but two games and tallying at least 876 rushing yards and four touchdowns per season.\nHall is also among the most prolific receiving backs in the NFL. He is coming off his first 1,000-yard rushing season but did take a step backward as a receiver with 36 catches, 350 yards and one touchdown -- each representing personal lows for a full season.\n            ",

The play began when Giuliano Simeone received the ball from Marc Pubill, Simeone then making his way down the left flank and sitting on the edge of the penalty area before whipping a cross towards the far post. Brugge's Brandon Mechele was on the receiving end and headed the ball away, which Cardoso ran towards outside the box.The midfielder first controlled the ball with his head and sent it to his feet before letting it take a bounce, finally hitting the ball as it came back up. His powerful strike sailed through traffic and past Brugge goalkeeper Simon Mignolet before landing in the back of the net.Watch the strike below.\nIt is both Cardoso's first goal in the Champions League and his first since joining Atleti in the summer, and comes at a very important juncture in his season. He has just 19 appearances for the Spanish club after dealing with a series of injuries but has regularly played in the new year, building match fitness as final preparation is underway for players and coaches alike ahead of the World Cup co-hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico.\nCardoso is a USMNT hopeful with 22 caps but just as injuries have disrupted the early months of his time with Atleti, he has been out of the national team fold for several months. He was last with the group during their run to the Concacaf Gold Cup final but he only 11 total minutes during the competition, all in the group stage as fitness issues hampered his ability to take part in the rest of the tournament.\n            \n",

    "body": "\n        As Tom Haberstroh recently noted, Cade Cunningham and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander are the only current NBA MVP candidates on track to make the 65-game mark, which serves as the minimum threshold for eligibility. SGA is cutting it close. He's missed OKC's last seven games and nine overall, and is expected to miss at least three more. That would put him at 12 games missed, with 17 being the cutoff. Cunningham has only missed six. This may make him the favorite by default. Meanwhile, Nikola Jokić can only miss one more game before he becomes ineligible. Victor Wembanyama can only miss four more. Luka Dončić can miss five more, but for me, he's not even a top-five candidate at present (I know there will be some pushback on this, and I get it, we're splitting hairs here on a bunch of unbelievable players). At any rate, as long as you're mathematically eligible to win the award, you're eligible to make our rankings. So here they are, the top five MVP candidates as I see them standing (not necessarily how they rank in terms of winning odds) entering play on Tuesday, Feb. 24. 1. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, ThunderMVP odds (via FanDuel): -145SGA was expected to return to the lineup following the All-Star break but that hasn't happened. He's missed nine games so far and is expected to miss at least three more before he returns from this abdominal strain -- which includes head-to-heads with his two closest MVP competitors in Nikola Jokić and Cade Cunningham. Bummer for us. Those games could've had an honest impact on voting if they swung one way considerably. \nAt any rate, when SGA returns he'll be at 12 games missed, at least. That would mean he can miss five more the rest of the season to make the 65-game threshold. Doable, of course. But it does put him in some danger of falling out with one more even marginally extended absence, particularly as Mark Daigneault has said he's not going to prioritize MVP eligibility over SGA's health and OKC's championship goal, as he shouldn't. All of that said, SGA remains the favorite to win his second straight MVP until further notice. If he gets it, he will enter rare air as just the 16th player in history to win multiple MVPs. His case is pretty iron clad. He was the MVP last season and he's been even better this season. He's shooting better from every spot on the floor, particularly from 3. He's the best mid-range shooter in the league. His FG%, 2-PT%, 3PT%, eFG% and TS% are all career highs. His 135.2 points per 100 possessions is seven points better than last season (per Cleaning the Glass), when he led the league in scoring. \nThis year he's second to Luka Dončić by exactly one point per game, but the efficiency isn't even close. The Thunder outscore opponents by 11.2 PPG when he's on the floor, and they're 9.3 points per 100 possessions worse when he's off the floor, per CTG. 2. Cade Cunningham, PistonsMVP odds: +600Cunningham was all but erased from Monday's marquee matchup against Spurs. From point to paint, the combination of Stephon Castle and Victor Wembanyama straight-jacketed him into a 5-for-26 dud that left Detroit without any source of offense whatsoever. And that's the MVP case right there: The Pistons have no repeatable way to put the ball in the basket other than Cunningham. When he goes to the bench, the offense goes from top-five to bottom-five, per CTG. \nEven with that defense (which he's also a big part of), and even in the Eastern Conference, the Pistons would be a play-in team, at best, without Cunningham. But with him, they are, and have been, going head to head with OKC for the best record in the league. Cunningham, Luka Doncic and Nikola Jokic are the only players averaging at least 25 points and eight assists this season (Cunningham leads the league in points generated via assists, per PBP Stats). To me, the case for Cunningham over Doncic is clear. Cunningham plays both sides. The Pistons are a better team. If it's even an honest debate, that breaks the tie. It's a much tougher call against SGA, Jokic and Victor Wembanyama, all of whom are decidedly more efficient shooters and overall scorers that Cade, and they are leading arguably better teams. All three of those guys are better players than Cade, bottom line, but Cade has closed the gap in that regard to a point that circumstance can, and should, put him right in line with their MVP narratives. \nThree years ago, Detroit was the worst team in the league with just 17 wins. Two years they dropped to 14 and endured an NBA record 28-game losing streak. Then Cunningham leveled up. Last season, Detroit became the first team in history to triple its win total from the previous non-shortened season, and this year they have been the class of their conference basically from the jump. That is all disproportionately due to Cunningham, who on top of that has only missed six games this season. If the best ability is availability, Cunningham has been in the nightly grind more than any of these other guys, and even if a couple of them squeak past the 65-game threshold, he's on pace to play 73. That should be another in what is becoming a field of feathers in Cunningham's MVP-case cap. 3. Victor Wembanyama, SpursMVP odds: +2500I don't think a lot of people want to accept the Spurs as a true title contender this season. It still feels too early in the process. They were supposed to be one of those teams that would hopefully earn a playoff spot just for the experience. But they've blown past that projection. They're the West's No. 2 seed and they've beaten the No. 1 seed and defending champion Thunder four times. They're a top-tier contender, traditional timelines be damned, and it's because of Victor Wembanyama. \nDon't get me wrong, the Spurs are an excellent team on both ends independent of Wemby, but he's the one that changes the game to a degree that all traditional analysis has to be basically disregarded. It reminds me of the expedited emergence of the 2014-15 Warriors. That happened too quickly for a lot of people to accept, too, but then you looked up and they had won the whole damn thing. They had a great young team, just like the Spurs, but the start of that dynasty can be tracked directly to Stephen Curry, who geometrically warped the offensive end of the court to such a degree that nobody was equipped to defend it. Wemby does the same thing defensively, effectively shrinking the court to the same effect that Curry expands it. What has always been enough space to drive through or put up a shot in is no longer adequate as Wemby can erase 10 feet of separation like its five and spike what you thought was, and against any other opponent would be, a clean shot. That changes an entire offense. Causes more \"never mind\" retreats than we've ever seen. The paint is Cunnningham's office and he missed 13 of his 16 shots in there on Monday. A lot of it was the sheer presence of Wemby (not to mention Stephon Castle all over him, to the point that Detroit had to take Cade off the ball at the start of possessions to allow him to breathe) messing with his typical rhythms. That sixth sense guys like Cunningham have for their scoring spots gets jumbled to hell when Wemby is around, because you know he's always lurking to do this to you. \nAnd this, of course, is to say nothing of Wemby's offense. Over San Antonio's current nine-game winning streak he's averaging 24.9 points, 12 rebounds, 3.4 assists, 3.4 blocks and 1.3 steals a night. For the season, he's currently on track to become the only player in NBA history to average over 24 points, 11 rebounds and two blocks in less than 30 minutes per game. When this guy is playing potentially closer to 40 minutes in playoff games, yes, the Spurs have enough to win it all. I'm not saying they will. But they have enough. Wemby makes that big a difference -- 12.6 points per 100 possessions, per CTG, to be exact, even on a team with a bunch of other studs. It probably won't be enough to win him the MVP. For starters he's missed 13 games (the NBA Cup title game vs. the Knicks counts toward games played but not toward statistics, believe it or not), meaning he can only miss four more to even be eligible. \nBut I'll tell you what, if the Spurs jump the Thunder for the No. 1 seed (this is more than feasible with just two losses separating them and San Antonio owning the tiebreaker), given the impact Wemby is having, his case is going to have to be seriously considered. At any rate, for the time being at least, Wemby's impact is great enough to slot him higher than Jokić on my board due to the fact that he's far more likely to make the 65-game mark and his Spurs have been a better team. 4. Nikola Jokić, NuggetsMVP odds: +300Chances are he's not going to qualify. He can only miss one more game the rest of the season and Denver has four back-to-backs remaining, to say nothing of any little tweak. But until further notice, Jokić remains a top candidate for a Nuggets team declines by a whopping 16.5 points per 100 possessions when he isn't on the floor, per Cleaning the Glass. \nThat's the biggest on-off impact among any of the MVP candidates. The Nuggets literally go from an offensive rating that would rank, by an appreciable margin, as the best in NBA history with Jokic on the floor to right on the edge of a bottom-10 unit this season without him. He has a better No. 2 than Cunningham in Jamal Murray, but Denver and Detroit share a disproportionate dependence on their superstar, and in the end, Jokić is the best player in the world. His case, as it is every season, is airtight. He's averaging a triple-double and you've hardly noticed its so routine --  28.8 PPG on the best true-shooting percentage in the league. He's the league leader in assists and rebounds per game. He remains an advanced-metric god. But we're splitting hairs here, and he's missed a lot of time. If he cowboys up and doesn't miss a game the rest of the way, he's going to get a lot of votes. But right now, Cunningham has done enough for a top-seed team, and Wemby likewise for a higher-seeded team, to deserve an edge in my non-voter opinion. \n5. Jaylen Brown, CelticsMVP odds: +5000LeBron James said it after the Celtics -- led by Brown's 32 points, eight rebounds, seven assists and three steals -- dismantled the Lakers on Sunday: \"JB is playing great basketball, man. This whole MVP thing, I don't understand why his name is not getting talked about some, as well. Nobody gave them a shot to start the season. He's averaging, what, 30? Just under 30. It's a popularity contest sometimes.\"LeBron is spot on here. Brown is averaging 29.2 PPG, fourth-best in the league, and the Celtics that were supposed to be in a gap year are instead the East's No. 2 seed and a legitimate conference threat despite losing Jayson Tatum, Jrue Holiday, Al Horford and Kristaps Porziņģis from last year's squad. No other MVP candidate has endured that kind of roster depletion and still managed to keep his team in the title conversation. Brown has been an absolute killer. His efficiency doesn't jump off the page (for a while his midrange numbers were insane, but they've declined more into the still really freaking good category largely thanks to a 48% clip from the dreaded 15-19 foot rang, per NBA.com), but he's having to attempt so many tough, self created shots while also clocking a career high assist percentage that volume has to be noted positively for his case. Brown has never taken anything close to the 22 shots per game he's taking this season. That's by necessity. Long has the perception existed that Brown occupied the tier of star players below the super level, but that's been put to bed. Jaylen Brown is a superstar. No go-to guy has had more responsibility on his plate this year, perhaps other than Cunningham, and he has exceeded the responsibility in every way. \n            ",

Either could be a first round pick in a one-QB startup draft and both are virtual locks to be drafted in the first two rounds. But it is worth considering whether the better bet to to target a Tier 2 guy, and that tier just keeps getting bigger.There is pretty universal agreement that both Colston Loveland and Tyler Warren belong in the second tier at tight end. Most people have one or two of Tucker Kraft, Harold Fannin, and Sam LaPorta as well. I would include all three, especially after Detroit added Drew Petzing as their offensive coordinator. Petzing helped develop McBride in Arizona. Petzing's former boss may be responsinble for a sixth tight end getting added to this tier soon.Take a look at Heath Cummings' way-too-early 2026 tight end projections here.All indications are that the Falcons will not allow Kyle Pitts to leave Atlanta. That means he'll be playing for Kevin Stefanski in 2026. Stefanski's Browns averaged 166 tight end targets per season over the last three years. Pitts just set career highs in targets, catches, and touchdowns in 2025 and could be in line to best some of those numbers in his Age 26 season. Assuming reports are correct that Pitts is staying in Atlanta, he'll be at the bottom of Tier 2, potentially as the cheapest Tier 2 tight available in Dynasty leagues this offseason.\nEarlier in February I had Mike Faiella from Dynasty League Football on Fantasy Football Today Dynasty to discuss the state of the tight end position in Dynasty. Check it out:There is a pretty significant drop off towards the bottom of my top 12, with two wild cards in the middle. I believe both Oronde Gadsden and Isaiah Likely have the potential to jump into the top six Dynasty tight ends but there are questions to answer. The first is what's Gadsden's role will look like in Mike McDaniel's offense. The second is where Likely will play in 2026, as he is a free agent. For now I am slightly more optimistic about Gadsden, and he is three years younger, but the right landing spot for Likely could change that quickly. Washington and Philadelphia are two of my favorite landing spots for Likely. Kansas City could be on that list as well but it is sounding more and more like Travis Kelce could return for another year.Kenyon Sadiq is the one rookie who has a chance to crack my top 12 after the 2026 NFL Draft. Sadiq's athleticism gives him incredible upside, we'll just have to figure out if he can block well enough to be a full-time player. If he's drafted in the first half of Round 1, you can expect he'll rank no lower than 12 in these rankings.\nHere are my updated Dynasty tight end rankings:\n            \n",

Auburn forward Elyjah Freeman then scored a last-second tip-in bucket that gave Auburn its 75-74 victory. \"Mitch, if those MFers try to fine me, screw them,\" Pope said to Barnhart. \"I did not say a word about how they cheated us.\" Pope received questions about the foul during his press conference and gave a more diplomatic answer. \n\"Well, we're not allowed to talk about the referees,\" Pope said. \"But you guys saw it. I think, sometimes, it's just super personal. I'm not allowed to comment on the referees. I won't comment on the referees. It's unfortunate that -- it's just unfortunate. It didn't cost us the game. We're in control of the game. We'll find ways to go win.\"Kentucky's loss to Auburn was its third defeat in a row. Two of the losses in that span have come against ranked opponents. With just over two weeks to go until the SEC Tournament commences, the Wildcats are tied for sixth in the SEC standings with a conference record of 8-6. \nPope's squad returns to the court Tuesday night against South Carolina. \n            \n",

    "body": "\n        The Indiana Pacers and Utah Jazz were recently hit with significant fines from the NBA for tanking, which has become one of the hot topics of debate this season with so many teams racing to the bottom ahead of a loaded 2026 NBA Draft class. The Jazz were fined $500,000 for \"conduct detrimental to the league\" for benching star players regularly for the fourth quarter in an effort to lose, while the Pacers were fined $100,000 for \"violating the Player Participation Policy\" when they rested Pascal Siakam and two other starters for a game against the Jazz -- including Aaron Nesmith. Unsurprisingly, Pacers coach Rick Carlisle didn't agree with the NBA's decision and went into detail on why during a radio appearance in Indianapolis on Tuesday. He told 107.5 The Fan about the league's call with the Pacers and how the NBA insisted Nesmith could have played without speaking to Nesmith or the Pacers' team doctors. \"Yeah, I put out a statement about it. I didn't agree with it,\" Carlisle said. \"There was a league lawyer that was doing the interview that kind of unilaterally decided that Aaron Nesmith, who had been injured the night before and couldn't hold the ball, should have played in the game, which just seems ridiculous. And during the interview process, I was not on it, but I heard details. We asked them if they wanted to talk to the doctors, our doctors about it, because it's something that was documented by our doctors and trainers. They said no, they didn't need to. They talked to their doctors who did not examine Aaron Nesmith, and we asked them if they wanted to talk to the kid, and they said no, they didn't need to. So this was shocking. This was shocking to me. And during the interview they also asked if we considered medicating him to play in a game when we were 30 games under .500. So I was very surprised. You know, obviously didn't agree with it. This is really the first time I've gone into any detail about it. But that was the deal. And so yeah, that was it.\" If the league did suggest Nesmith should play without consulting the doctors that examined him and insisted he should've been medicated to play in a game, that does seem like a significant overreach on the part of the NBA. \nIt does need to be noted that Carlisle wasn't on this call and heard these details secondhand -- surely from someone frustrated within the Pacers organization about the outcome of the call -- but if that is indeed how the conversation went, that feels like a problem with the NBA's process that they need to address. The Nesmith injury being legitimate is certainly Indiana's most salient argument against the fine, but that seems like it was a more secondary concern to Siakam's absence for the NBA. Mostly, the Pacers ran into the issue of the league feeling significant pressure from the outside, including its media partners, to address tanking that feels more widespread and aggressive than we've seen in some time. \nWhile Indiana is understandably not happy with being singled out and hit with a $100,000 fine, that game with the Jazz -- which they lost -- was critical to the lottery race and if you gave the Pacers some truth serum, I bet they'd tell you it was worth the 100 grand. \n            ",

Expert Micah Roberts, who is on a 38-18 roll on college basketball picks (+1869), agrees, saying:\"Saint Louis is 25-2 on the year, which brings a big target on its back. The Billikens lost their last road game at Rhode Island 81-76 as a 9.5-point favorite. They were losing at home in their last game to VCU, but had a furious comeback in the second half to win. Dayton has won and covered its last three games, but it was on January 30th that they lost 102-71 to Saint Louis. Dayton played well that day, but had 15 turnovers, and Saint Louis shot 62% from the field. Saint Louis has the No. 1 defense in the nation, holding opponents to 36.3% shooting. The Billikens are 7-1 on the road, and I think they win this one by double-digits.\"New users can bet on Saint Louis (-4.5) with the latest DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your first $5+ bet wins:\nWarriors vs. Pelicans, 8 p.m. ETPick: De'Anthony Melton Under 16.5 total pointsSportsLine's model is projecting 16 points as Melton has failed to hit hit points total in four of the past six road games. NBA props expert Alex 'PropStarz' Selenick, who returned more than 75 units on his NBA picks over the past two full seasons, agrees with this prop, saying:\"Melton has eclipsed this number in three consecutive games, but I believe this is a significantly inflated line considering his playing time, role and usage. Melton hovers between 22-25 minutes and while he's never been afraid to shoot, this is projected to be a paced down environment. I would also argue that Melton looks like a regression candidate as well.\"Selesnick played that line at Caesars Sportsbook, where new users can sign up with the Caesars Sportsbook promo code CBSSPORTS250BM and receive a first bet match of up to $250 in bonus bets.\nHow to get bets bets for NBA, college basketball and more at SportsLineNow that you've seen some of SportsLine's consensus picks for Tuesday, join to get picks for every game from a proven computer model and a team of more than 40 Vegas experts.

A total of 11 players will score more than 9 points, per the model, which allows the standard total to be eclipsed by over a dozen points.

    "body": "\n        The 2026 season could be make-or-break for quarterback C.J. Stroud regarding his tenure with the Houston Texans. But don't expect the franchise to move away from him just yet. General manager Nick Caserio insisted that the Texans have no plans to trade Stroud ahead of his fourth season and that any suggestion to the contrary is \"moronic.\"Multiple factors contributed to the murmurs of a potential trade. Most importantly, Stroud enters the final year of his rookie contract in Houston and regressed on an annual basis, by multiple measures, since his fantastic 2023 debut season. The Texans' long-term commitment to Stroud is uncertain, even with Caserio standing up for him as the 2026 starter.\"He's our quarterback,\" Caserio said at the NFL Combine of Stroud. \"He ain't going anywhere. We have a lot of confidence, a lot of belief. The philosophy DeMeco and I have, we're going to support our players and do everything we can to help them.\"The Texans could pick up a $27 million club option to keep Stroud on board through 2027. The Ohio State product is also now extension-eligible. \"He have a lot of confidence in C.J.,\" Caserio said. \"We got a lot of confidence in our players. We're glad he's our quarterback.\"\nStroud opened his professional career as the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year and led the league with 273.9 passing yards per game as a first-year standout. Since then, however, his output has dwindled significantly. He passed for a career-worst 217.2 yards per game last season and struggled mightily in the postseason with five interceptions across two contests. Including both regular-season and postseason games, Stroud tossed exactly 13 interceptions in each of the last two years after logging just five as a rookie.\"This league is about ups and downs,\" Caserio said. \"Nothing is perfect. There was no team that was undefeated, unless I missed something, this year. That's not going to happen. By and large, you're probably going to lose five or six games. There will be some margin on either side.\"You're going to have some good plays. You're going to have some bad plays. You're going to have some good games. You're going to have some bad games. How do you bounce back? How do you handle that? This league is a one game at a time proposition. How you handle it, every situation, ultimately is going to determine your success and your longevity.\"\nIf the Texans hold off on awarding Stroud an extension this offseason, they would effectively delay their decision on his long-term future by a year. Picking up his club option in 2027 would further delay the potentially inevitable. But on the same token, affording Stroud another opportunity to rekindle his rookie-season magic could be precisely what the former No. 2 overall pick needs to get his career back on track.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The Miami Dolphins are among the most interesting teams entering the 2026 offseason due to the uncertainty of their quarterback situation. The expectation around the league is that Miami will trade Tua Tagovailoa. With a new regime in charge, most anticipate general manager Jon-Eric Sullivan and coach Jeff Hafley to want to bring in their own guy at quarterback, but finding a trade for Tagovailoa after his struggles to end the 2025 season will be a challenge. Sullivan spoke Tuesday at the NFL Scouting Combine and decided to jump in front of the Tagovailoa question when asked about evaluating the roster.\"We're evaluating the entire roster, right. As it pertains to Tua [Tagovailoa], we've had conversations with Tua and his representation, everything is on the table including the potential of a trade,\" Sullivan said. \"We don't know which way that's gonna go. There's a lot of different factors at play, lotta conversations being had. But evaluating the roster, Quinn [Ewers] did a nice job towards the end of the year. Excited about what's ahead for him. Tua, I thought even though things did go well at the end of the year, did some good things along the way and it's my job to infuse competition into that room, as well as every other room, as we go down the road.\"One of the complicating factors in trading Tagovailoa is the $45 million in dead cap the Dolphins face in the wake of trading him. Other factors include finding a team wanting to take a swing on Tagovailoa and the likelihood Miami would need to eat a good portion of the $54 million owed to Tagovailoa in 2026. \nThat's all part of what Sullivan is trying to navigate right now, but it's also notable that he points to Quinn Ewers, as the seventh-round pick from 2025 closed the season as the starter in Miami and threw for 622 yards, three touchdowns and three interceptions. Miami has been strongly linked to Malik Willis as a free agent target given Sullivan and Hafley's connection to Willis as a member of the Green Bay Packers the last two years. One question is what the order of operations needs to be for Miami to sign Willis, whether that can happen before they resolve Tagovailoa or if it would need to come after a Tagovailoa trade is completed. \nAll of that is what Sullivan and the new Dolphins front office is working through as the Combine begins and they have a chance to talk with other teams face-to-face in an attempt to find a resolution on Tagovailoa's situation ahead of free agency starting on March 9. \n            \n",

The model entered Week 19 on a sizzling 38-18 roll on top-rated NBA spread picks dating back to last season. Anyone following its NBA betting advice at sportsbooks and on betting apps could have seen huge returns.Tuesday best bets at DraftKings SportsbookKnicks vs. Cavaliers: Over 230.5 points (-115)Bucks (+5.5) vs. Heat (-110)Duke (-17.5) vs. Notre Dame (-110)Combining the three picks into a Tuesday parlay at DraftKings would result in a payout of +581 (risk $100 to win $631, odds subject to change). Bet it at DraftKings here:\nKnicks vs. Cavaliers: Over 230.5 points (-115)The Over has hit in three of the last four Cavaliers games as the duo of Cleveland guards Donovan Mitchell and James Harden learn how to complement one another on the court. Harden has never been one celebrated for his defensive prowess, so both his playmaking offensive ability and lackluster defensive skillset have this model siding with the Over. Cleveland has allowed at least 113 points in three of those four games, and the Knicks have the No. 8 scoring offense at 117.6 points per game this season. Cleveland is third at 119.7 ppg this season. Jalen Brunson is ninth in the NBA at 26.8 ppg this season, and Karl-Anthony Towns is coming off back-to-back imposing scoring performances, scoring 25 and 28 points. The model projects the Over to hit in 58.6% of simulations. Back the Over at DraftKings here:Bucks (+5.5) vs. HeatGiannis Antetokounmpo (calf) remains out for the Bucks, but besides him, it's a rather clean injury report for a Milwaukee team that still has some talent. The Bucks had their three-game winning streak snapped in a 122-94 loss to the Raptors on Sunday, and although the Heat have won three straight games, none of them came against teams exactly playing the most motivated basketball at this point of the season (wins over the Pelicans, Hawks and Grizzlies). The Bucks have shown their depth with three different leading scorers over their last three games. Ryan Rollins has scored more than 20 points in six of seven games this month for the Bucks, who are 18-16 against the spread as the underdog this season. The model projects the Bucks to cover in 58% of simulations. Back the Bucks at DraftKings here:Duke (-17.5) vs. Notre Dame\"Duke enters the contest as one of the most mathematically dominant teams in the nation, ranking ninth overall in offensive efficiency and fourth in defensive efficiency,\" SportsLine expert Jeff Hochman said. \"The Fighting Irish counter with a pedestrian offensive efficiency of 114.9 (ranked 88th nationally) and a highly vulnerable defensive efficiency of 106.0 (ranked 109th). The Blue Devils have a magnificent 57.5% effective field goal percentage on the offensive end, a metric largely driven by a physically dominant interior presence that secures a massive 36.9% offensive rebounding rate. Notre Dame will be forced to compete without freshman guard Jalen Haralson, their leading scorer and primary offensive initiator, who has been ruled out of this contest with an unspecified injury.\" Back Duke at DraftKings here:\nWant more NBA and college basketball picks on Tuesday?You've seen some of the model's Tuesday best bets.

In theory, if you hit on a wide receiver, he could be in your starting lineup for the next eight years. And there is some evidence of that stability in the rankings below. Every wide receiver who is currently in my top nine was in my top 12 one year ago. And they will all be 27 or younger when the 2026 season starts, so they could stay in the top 12 when the season begins. After that top nine is Tetairoa McMillan, who wasn't even in the NFL one year ago. After that, things get a little crazy.Rashee Rice is currently at WR11, and I am not sure how anyone could rank him appropriately right now. Rice has shown the ability to be ranked as high as WR6, but every offseason, we have to deal with either an injury or a potential suspension, or both. I have left him at WR11 as his most recent legal troubles get sorted out, but I'm more likely to sell at that ranking than buy. The guy right behind him, George Pickens, will move ahead of him as soon as his contract gets sorted out, but dealing with the Cowboys, there is still a little bit of potential drama left in that scenario. And that rounds out the top 12.View Heath Cummings' way-too-early 2026 wide receiver projections here.Amongst the 12 guys I have ranked between WR13 and WR24, three have huge quarterback questions (Marvin Harrison Jr., Garrett Wilson, and Jaylen Waddle), two are legitimate trade candidates (A.J. Brown and Brian Thomas Jr.), and eight of the 12 will have new play callers in 2026. I still believe virtually all of them still have top 12 upside, and Brown is the only one with anything close to age concerns. If you are looking for the most stable player in the WR2 range, it may just be Chris Olave.\nEarlier in February, I had Adam Pfeifer from FTN Fantasy on Fantasy Football Today Dynasty to break down the state of the wide receiver position in Dynasty. Check it out:Olave heads into 2026 with the same coach and quarterback that he had in 2025, when he set career highs in catches (100), yards (1,163), and touchdowns (nine). He doesn't even turn 26 years old until June. That being said, the future beyond 2026 is anything but predictable. We don't have nearly enough tape on Tyler Shough to suggest he's the long-term answer at QB for the Saints, and Olave is currently slated to become a free agent after this season. My expectation is if Shough loses his job this year, it is because the Saints lose enough games to draft an even better quarterback prospect in a much better 2027 class. And I would be pretty shocked if Olave doesn't sign a long-term deal to stay in New Orleans.Of course, the WR2 landscape will also be changed significantly by the 2026 NFL Draft. I anticipate Carnell Tate, Makai Lemon, and Jordyn Tyson will all rank inside my top 15 at the position once they are drafted, and there's a chance Denzel Boston or KC Concepcion sneak inside the top 24. This position should remain pretty stable in the top 10, but there are plenty of coming changes to the WR2 ranks.\nHere are my updated Dynasty wide receiver rankings:\n            ",

Bet it at bet365 here:Houston -7.5 vs. TCU (-110)\"I like to back Houston after a rare poor defensive performance,\" SportsLine expert Thomas Casale said. \"The Cougars allowed Texas Tech to put up 90 points and shoot 41 percent from three-point range. Kelvin Sampson prides himself on having strong defensive teams, so you can bet practices weren't fun for the Houston players the last few days. Texas Tech actually matches up well with the Cougars. TCU does not. Houston should eat the Horned Frogs alive on the offensive glass, while its ball pressure defense causes havoc against a TCU squad that can be sloppy with the basketball. The Cougars are 6-2 away from home this season and I expect them to bounce back with an emphatic win on Tuesday.\" Back Houston at bet365 here:\nUnder 229 in Heat vs. Magic (-110)Miami is in a good position to put up a strong defensive performance on Wednesday night, as it has not played since Sunday. The Heat held the Suns to just 102 points in that game, which flew Under the total of 226. These teams played in early December, combining for just 211 points in a game that had a total of 241. Orlando is on a five-game losing streak and has not scored more than 109 points in any of those contests. The model is projecting 215 points on Wednesday night, as the Under hits in 57% of simulations. Back the Under at bet365 here:Rockets -2.5 vs. Spurs (-110)Houston has won five of its last six games, and its only loss at home since Nov. 21 came against defending champion Oklahoma City.

    "body": "\n        The men and women who make up the United States Olympic and Paralympic teams do not get paid by the U.S. government, but starting with the Milano Cortina Olympics in February, each athlete will receive $200,000 regardless of performance. That's thanks to a record $100 million donation to the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee from financier Ross Stevens, who cited his desire to provide athletes with some financial security as the reason for his gift. \"I do not believe that financial insecurity should stop our nation's elite athletes from breaking through to new frontiers of excellence,\" Stevens told the Wall Street Journal.The $200,000 won't be in the form of a one-time paycheck, but instead comes in two installments of $100,000. The first of those will come 20 years after their first qualifying Olympic appearance or at age 45, whichever comes later. The other $100,000 will be in the form of a guaranteed benefit for their families after they die. Athletes will be eligible for $200,000 for each Olympics they compete in, meaning those that compete for multiple Olympics can earn even more. \nCurrently, athletes are only paid prize money for medaling in events with that money coming from TV revenue and sponsorships. At the 2024 Paris Olympics, the USOPC paid athletes $37,500 for winning gold, $22,500 for silver and $15,000 for bronze. This new donation will be particularly impactful for athletes in smaller sports that don't have professional leagues or avenues to making significant money by participating in those sports year-round. Many Olympic athletes work regular jobs and have to make difficult decisions about whether to continue training and pursuing their Olympic dreams given the relatively small financial backing they receive. Knowing that there will be $100,000 provided for them later in life and another $100,000 for their family after they die can provide some security and motivation for continuing to pursue their Olympic dream. \nMany other nations already provide pensions or retirement benefits to athletes, but the USOPC doesn't get any federal funding and, prior to Stevens' donation, didn't have the funding to offer that to athletes. Now that's available, and the 232 athletes on Team USA for the 2026 Winter Olympics and Paralympics will be the first beneficiaries. \n            ",

They enter Super Bowl LX with a 16-1 record over their last 17 games, which is not a record that even Seattle can measure up to. New England has incredible balance, ranking second in points scored and fourth in points allowed, with the offense specifically standing out. Drake Maye combines both efficiency with a big-play ability as he leads the league in both completion percentage and yards per pass attempt. Meanwhile, the defense is playing its best entering Super Bowl Sunday as New England has given up one or fewer touchdowns in each of its last five games. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Seahawks can coverIt's hard to find any holes with Seattle, including in regard to the spread, as it has both the most covers and the best cover percentage of the regular plus postseason. The Seahawks are the only NFL team to rank in the top three in both scoring offense and scoring defense, and just five teams had more takeaways in the regular season. Mike Macdonald's crew also boasts top-10 rankings on both the ground and thru the air, but the defense is the star of this team. Seattle leads the NFL in points allowed, third-down defense, yards per rush allowed and yards per pass attempt allowed while ranking second in yards per play given up and rushing touchdowns allowed. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Seahawks vs. Patriots picksSportsLine's model has simulated Patriots vs. Seahawks 10,000 times and is going Under on the total, projecting 44 combined points. It also says one side of the spread is the better value. You can only get the pick at SportsLine. So who wins Seahawks vs. Patriots, and which side of the Super Bowl spread is the better value?

    "body": "\nFrom NFL player props to Patriots vs. Seahawks (-4.5, 45.5) picks against the spread, your 2026 Super Bowl parlay can go in a number of different directions. Another option is guessing the margin of victory of the game, and there's an NFL betting trend that could help in that regard. Entering Super Bowl LX, three of the last four editions of The Big Game have been decided by exactly 3 points. So, you could back the game's winning margin to be exactly 3 points in a 2026 Super Bowl SGP, which would return +500.Seattle winning by 3 points has +950 NFL prop odds, while New England doing the same carries +1100 odds. But if you want to increase your potential winnings exponentially, then you could string one of these wagers with others into a lucrative Super Bowl same-game parlay. There are countless 2026 Super Bowl picks with plus-money payouts you can target, from alternate lines to anytime TD scorers to exact score predictions. Before making any Super Bowl 60 picks and NFL parlays, you need to see the epic Super Bowl LX same game parlay from SportsLine's proven model that pays out $15,000 on just a $10 bet.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters the 2026 Super Bowl on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now that the simulation model has had a chance to digest the Super Bowl 60 NFL odds, it's locked in its betting picks to form a longshot NFL parlay that could pay out $15,000 for a $10 bettor. You can only see the picks and full parlay by heading to SportsLine.\nTop 2026 Super Bowl parlay picksFor Super Bowl LX, one of the picks featured in the longshot parlay is Patriots WR Kayshon Boutte as an anytime TD scorer (+310). Despite ranking 68th amongst wideouts in catches (33) in the regular season, Boutte was 18th in positional receiving touchdowns (6). He added another score in the Divisional Round and then got a redzone target in the AFC Title Game. While Seattle has an elite defense, through the air is where to exploit that unit. Eight of the last 10 touchdowns the Seahawks have allowed have been via the pass, including all three they gave up in the NFC Title Game.Boutte has more touchdowns this season than the Pats leading receiver, Stefon Diggs, despite the latter having twice as many targets and receptions. The model projects Boutte to score 0.31 touchdowns, which is the highest amongst all Patriots and brings great value to these plus-money odds as one leg of a Super Bowl SGP. See the rest of the picks in the Super Bowl LX same game parlay here, and you can bet Boutte as an anytime TD scorer using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nHow to make NFL parlay picks for a payout of $15,000The parlay also includes three additional Super Bowl picks from SportsLine's NFL model, including a must-see first NFL touchdown-scorer prop that pays out 25-1. You can only see the Seahawks vs. Patriots picks and the full parlay at SportsLine.What are the top NFL picks for Super Bowl LX that can be combined into an NFL SGP that returns $15,000 on just a $10 bet, and which optimal first touchdown scorer prop pays out 25-1?

    "body": "\n        The matchup is set. It'll be the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots duking it out for the right to lift the Lombardi Trophy and call themselves Super Bowl LX champions. These clubs find themselves en route to Santa Clara for the big game after eking out wins on Championship Sunday, albeit in different fashions. Seattle had to throw its way to a Super Bowl appearance as Sam Darnold threw for 346 yards and three touchdowns in a 31-27 victory over the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC Championship. Meanwhile, New England churned out a 10-7 win during a snowy AFC Championship against the Denver Broncos at Mile High. The Patriots leaned on defense and Drake Maye's rushing ability to punch their ticket. While these are widely different versions of these clubs, this is a rematch of Super Bowl XLIX back during the 2014 season. That game is remembered most for Malcolm Butler's infamous goal-line interception to give Tom Brady and the Patriots their then-fourth Super Bowl title in franchise history, and spoil Russell Wilson and the Seahawks bid at back-to-back championships. \n        \n            \n                2026 Super Bowl SGP, props, Seahawks vs. Patriots same-game parlay: Get an epic $15,000 return on a $10 bet\n                \n                    Ross Kelly                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThat's the history. But what does the future have in store for us in this upcoming Super Bowl? What do the oddsmakers think of this matchup? Below, we'll comb over the initial lines for Super Bowl LX and also highlight some of the notable favorites for Super Bowl MVP. NFL odds courtesy of DraftKings Sportsbook.\nGameEarly LineEarly TotalEarly MoneylineSeahawks vs. PatriotsSeahawks -4.546.5Seahawks -230, Patriots +190While Lumen Field and Gillette Stadium are two of the better home-field advantages that the NFL has to offer, both Seattle and New England were superb on the road this season, which could help them on this neutral site at Levi's Stadium for Super Bowl LX. With their win over the Broncos in the AFC Championship, New England became the first team in NFL history to go 9-0 on the road. Mike Vrabel's team was also 7-2 ATS in those nine road matchups. As for Seattle, they did not go undefeated on the road like the Patriots, but were an equally impressive 8-1 on the road. They also come into this Super Bowl with an NFL-best 8-1 ATS road record. \nPlayerSuper Bowl MVP oddsSam Darnold+130Drake Maye+235Jaxon Smith-Njigba+550Kenneth Walker III+600Rhamondre Stevenson+2500Rashid Shaheed+2800Marcus Jones+5500Stefon Diggs+6000Naturally, both quarterbacks are going to be No. 1 and No. 2 in the odds to win Super Bowl MVP. With the Seahawks favored, it makes sense to see Darnold as the odds-on favorite for the award. Seven of the last 10 Super Bowl MVPs were quarterbacks. Two of the remaining three were wide receivers (Cooper Kupp in Super Bowl LVI and Julian Edelman in Super Bowl LIII), while Von Miller (Super Bowl 50) was the other non-QB MVP and lone defensive player to earn the distinction over the last decade. \nInterestingly, both Kenneth Walker III and Rhamondre Stevenson have favorable odds out of the gate. If either of them is named Super Bowl MVP, they'd become the first running back to earn the award since Terrell Davis after Super Bowl XXXII. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James returned to a familiar place on Wednesday when his team faced the Cleveland Cavaliers. The 41-year-old, of course, is an Akron, Ohio, native and began his NBA career with the Cavaliers when the franchise drafted him with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2003 NBA Draft.With James playing his 23rd NBA season -- and the Lakers having only one scheduled trip to Cleveland this year -- the franchise gave him a proper welcome home tribute. Midway through the first quarter, the Cavaliers showed highlights of James scoring 25 consecutive points against the Detroit Pistons in the 2007 Eastern Conference finals. That series was ultimately won by the Cavs, helping the franchise secure a ticket to the NBA Finals.During the video tribute, James appeared to tear up. After the video played and before James returned to the court, he was shown wiping his eyes with a towel.\nAfter the game, a 129-99 loss, James said he was \"more present\" for this particular tribute than his past appearances as a visitor in Cleveland. \n\"I think it comes from just being present. I was more present today than the previous seven,\" James said. \"Definitely got to me a little bit. For sure. I was super thankful.\"\nWith the game out of hand in the second half, Bronny James -- LeBron's son and a deep reserve for the Lakers -- got some rare playing time down the stretch. He made the most of it in eight minutes, scoring eight points on a fastbreak dunk and a pair of 3-pointers. The elder James was appreciative of the moment and made note of the reception Bronny received from the Cleveland fans.\"It's a homecoming for him. Just to see him get that dunk, hit a couple shots, get the ovation from the fans -- pretty cool moment for him, for us as a family, for my wife and his siblings,\" James said. \"My mom is here watching her son and her grandson. It's so weird and so cool and so surreal. My mom gets to watch her son and her grandson play in the NBA at the same time.\"\nJames spent 11 seasons with the Cavaliers across two stints with the franchise. James helped Cleveland win the 2016 NBA Finals over the Golden State Warriors after battling back from a 3-1 deficit. James left Cleveland as a free agent in 2018 to join the Lakers.With James' retirement timeline unclear, this could mark his final time playing in Cleveland if he steps away after the 2025-26 season. However, ESPN reported in November that James is unsure if this will be his last season or if he will play at least one more.\nJames is averaging 22.4 points, 6.7 assists and 6.0 rebounds in 33.4 minutes per game. James has appeared in 28 games this season after missing the first month due to sciatica.\n            ",

Both the North Course and the South Course will welcome golfers to Torrey Pines for the 2026 Farmers Insurance Open, where 10 of the top 20 players in the Official World Golf Rankings will compete for the third title of the young season.Not included among those names inside the top 20 is perhaps the biggest of all this week: Brooks Koepka. Making his first start on the PGA Tour since the 2022 WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play, the 35-year-old returns to the league following four seasons with LIV Golf.Able to return to the PGA Tour through the newly created Returning Member Program, Koepka is required to play a full PGA Tour schedule while also being on the outside looking in when it comes to signature events. As such, the five-time major champion will become a fixture in these full-field tournaments; he is not only making his PGA Tour return this week at Torrey Pines, he has already committed to next week's WM Phoenix Open and the Cognizant Classic. Koepka's inclusion in the field also means two additional spots were added to round out threesomes.While Koepka looks to ease back into a normal playing schedule, players like Xander Schauffele and Cameron Young will also be making their season debuts. The two went in opposite directions in 2025 as Schauffele missed being included in the Tour Championship field for the first time in his career, and Young nabbed his first career victory at the Wyndham Championship.\nBoth players starred for the U.S. team at the Ryder Cup and will look to roll their momentum into the new year alongside the likes of reigning champion Harris English, U.S. Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley and teammate J.J. Spaun, plus Europeans such as Justin Rose and Ludvig Åberg and Sony Open winner Chris Gotterup.2026 Farmers Insurance Open scheduleDates: Jan. 29 - Feb. 1Location: Torrey Pines Golf Course (South Course) — San Diego, CaliforniaPar: 72 | Yardage: 7,765 | Architect: William BellPurse: $9,600,0002026 Farmers Insurance Open field, oddsOdds via DraftKings Sportsbook\nXander Schauffele (15-1)Ludvig Åberg (17-1): The young Swede acquitted himself nicely at Torrey Pines last season as he led the Farmers Insurance Open for most of the tournament before becoming ill over the weekend.

Åberg was forced to withdraw from the American Express last week due to illness, but he appears up to the challenge to return to competition at a golf course where he knows his game will translate.Cameron Young: (18-1): Many expect a big season from Young, but outside of a run at the Genesis Invitational a handful of seasons back, the West Coast Swing has never been too kind to him. He comes into this year as a PGA Tour winner, a Ryder Cup darling and off the best putting season of his career. Young is back to hitting his comfortable shot shape and has the power to play well at Torrey Pines, which features some of the thickest rough and thinnest fairways players face all season.Patrick Cantlay (23-1)Si Woo Kim (24-1): Kim may be the best ball striker in the world among players not named Scottie Scheffler. The 54-hole leader at the American Express, the four-time PGA Tour winner fell flat in the middle of his round and was ultimately upended by the world No. 1. Still, the result counted for his second straight quality outing to open up his campaign, and he seeks to move his game to a bigger, brawnier test that is Torrey Pines. He has two top 25 finishes in his last three appearances but has not finished inside the top 10 in eight career starts.J.J. Spaun (25-1)Chris Gotterup (29-1): He continues to show that, when the wind starts blowing, and a hair of creativity and shot shaping are required, he can stand tall. Gotterup claimed the third win of his PGA Tour career in as many seasons at the Sony Open, and he should be licking his lips at trying his hand at Torrey Pines, where he finished inside the top 25 during his lone prior trip. In possession of plenty of power and finesse, the right-hander has the goods to keep the momentum rolling on the mainland.Hideki Matsuyama (29-1): He has made nine straight cuts at Torrey Pines and arrives off a T13 at the Sony Open where he sizzled with his iron play and struggled with his putter -- Matsuyama's typical game. Putting from inside 15 feet and inside 5 feet are among the most difficult on the PGA Tour this week, so that could level the playing field ever so slightly and play into his hands. His iron play remains elite, and scramblers have fared well at this tournament, which is another feather in Matsuyama's cap.Maverick McNealy (31-1)Jason Day (31-1)Harris English (31-1)2026 Farmers Insurance Open picks\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Xander Schauffele\n                    \n            \n            \n        \nWinner (15-1): The fall was huge for someone like Schauffele as he was among the bright spots for the U.S. Ryder Cup team and claimed the Baycurrent Classic in Japan. He missed this tournament last season due to injury, so he will be champing at the bit to return to a comfortable golf course where the San Diego native has played hundreds of rounds. While his falloff in 2025 was noticeable, Schauffele struggled primarily on the greens after consistently being one of the best putters on the PGA Tour. He will return to that level of competence this year starting this week.\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Ryan Gerard\n                    \n            \n            \n        \nContender (45-1): If he keeps knocking on the door like this, it is bound to fall over. In two starts in 2026, Gerard has finished behind only Gotterup and Scheffler, the first two winners of the season. He continues to show his proficiency from tee to green, especially with his iron play, as he putter continues to play catch-up. Gerard's game may be tailored more to the difficult tests on the PGA Tour schedule, like Torrey Pines, where he finished T15 in his lone appearance.\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Sahith Theegala\n                    \n            \n            \n        \nSleeper (90-1): It has been a long year or so for Theegala, but he is now finally healthy and looking the part. The lovable right-hander notched a top 10 finish at the American Express -- his first since the 2024 Procore Championship -- and has made all four cuts in his Farmers Insurance Open career. The putter has carried most of the weight through two starts this season, but the driver is coming around in a way that should provide optimism for those in his camp.Who will win the 2026 Farmers Insurance Open, and which longshots will stun the golfing world? Visit SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard, all from the model that's nailed 16 golf majors heading into the weekend, and find out. \n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                                            ",

    "body": "\n        The Pro Football Hall of Fame has issued a statement amid the backlash of Bill Belichick's reported omission from the 2026 induction class.Belichick, a winner of eight Super Bowls, including six during his time as head coach of the New England Patriots, fell short of the 40 votes needed from the 50-person selection committee to be inducted in his first year of eligibility. A coach finalist, Belichick was competing for votes with Patriots owner Robert Kraft (the lone contributor finalist) and senior finalists Ken Anderson, Roger Craig and L.C. Greenwood. Voters could cast votes for three of the five finalists, and Belichick's snub has become a major source of controversy.Along with reinforcing the importance of the voting process, the Hall stressed that \"action will be taken\" if one or multiple voters committed a violation of the selection process.The Pro Football Hall of Fame understands and respects the passionate reaction of many fans, media members and enshrinees of the Hall itself in light of published reports regarding the voting results for the Class of 2026.It's that very passion that propels the game.The Hall also respects the members of the Selection Committee when they follow the selection process bylaws. It is an honor to serve as a selector.Each year, the Hall reviews the selection process and the composition of the 50-person Selection Committee. If it is determined that any member(s) violated the selection process bylaws, they understand action will be taken.That could include the possibility that such selector(s) would not remain a member of the committee moving forward.The selection of a new class is the most important duty the Hall of Fame oversees each year, and the integrity of that process cannot be in question.The Hall did not mention Belichick by name or identify which selection process bylaws may have been broken. One violation, for example, would be making a decision on a candidate based on non-football reasons. That does not, however, include Spygate, the Patriots' sign-stealing scandal that resulted in both Belichick and the Patriots receiving unprecedented fines by NFL commissioner Roger Goodell in 2007. So while Spygate is considered a valid reason to not give Belichick a vote, not giving him one because of a personal vendetta would be considered a violation of the bylaws. Spygate has been pointed to as a potential reason Belichick did not earn enshrinement in his first year of eligibility. Bill Polian, a Hall of Fame general manager and member of the selection committee, reportedly told others that he believed that Belichick should \"wait a year\" before getting inducted as penance for Spygate. Polian has denied doing this. \"That's totally and categorically untrue,\" he said. \"I voted for him.\" \n\n        \n            \n                Tom Brady, Robert Kraft denounce Bill Belichick's first-ballot Hall of Fame snub: 'I don't understand it'\n                \n                    Carter Bahns                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBelichick's omission from this year's Hall of Fame class has triggered a slew of emotional responses from notable figures in both the NFL and in other sports, including one from his former quarterback, Tom Brady. \"I don't understand it,\" Brady said. \"I was with him every day. If he's not a first-ballot Hall of Famer, there's really no coach that should ever be a first-ballot Hall of Famer. Which is completely ridiculous, because people deserve it. He's incredible. There's no coach I'd rather play for. If I'm taking one coach to go out there to win a Super Bowl, give me one season, I'm taking Bill Belichick. So that's enough said.\"Kraft also spoke out in defense of Belichick. \"Whatever perceptions may exist about any personal differences between Bill and me, I strongly believe Bill Belichick's record and body of work speak for themselves,\" Kraft told the Associated Press. \"As head coach of the New England Patriots for more than two decades, he set the standard for on-field excellence, preparation, and sustained success in the free agency and salary cap era of the National Football League. He is the greatest coach of all time and he unequivocally deserves to be a unanimous first-ballot Pro Football Hall of Famer.\"\nBelichick, 73, set a head coaching record with six Super Bowl wins and added two more as an assistant, leads all coaches with 12 Super Bowl appearances, ranks second all time with 333 career wins and holds more playoff victories (31) than any coach in league history.\n            ",

The UFC bantamweight champion recently underwent back surgery as he prepares to embark on his second reign as champion.The bantamweight division is heating up in the aftermath of UFC 324. Top contenders Sean O'Malley and Umar Nurmagomedov got their hands raised, while former champion Merab Dvalishvili has angled for an immediate rematch. The division cannot move forward without its king. On Tuesday, Yan posted a video update on his Instagram story.\"Don't lose me. I'm in rehab for a few months,\" Yan said in the video, UFC's Russian interpreter Sergey Nargorny told CBS Sports.\nYan's post included a series of written messages further detailing his condition. Yan underwent lumbar surgery on Monday, requiring nine hours under anesthesia. He confirmed that his condition will improve in \"a few months.\" Most lumbar surgeries require at least four to six weeks of recovery before resuming light activities, according to various health authority websites. Yan reclaimed the bantamweight throne after upsetting Dvalishvili at UFC 323 in December. Dvalishvili had ascended to being the greatest bantamweight of all-time. Yan was largely labeled a live body for his opponent. Dvalishvili was on the cusp of becoming the first fighter to make four successful UFC title defenses in one year. The overlooked contender outclassed Dvalishvili in virtually every aspect of MMA, winning a clear unanimous decision nearly five years after losing the title.\nThe reigning champ has three worthwhile challengers awaiting him. An immediate trilogy fight with Dvalishvili is on the table, especially considering Dvalishvili's sustained dominance before losing the title. O'Malley has a controversial win over Petr Yan and kept his chances alive by beating Song Yadong at UFC 324. On that same card, Nurmagomedov coasted by former two-time flyweight titleholder Deiveson Figueiredo. \n            \n    ",

CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones confirmed the news that the current North Carolina football coach did not receive the 40 out of 50 votes needed to reach the Hall of Fame in his first year on the ballot.This was Belichick's first year of eligibility since he had not coached in the NFL since 2023.Belichick, who won eight total Super Bowls (two as an assistant with the Giants, six as a head coach with the Patriots), is second all-time among NFL coaches with 333 career wins. That number only trails two-time Super Bowl winner and Hall of Famer Don Shula, who has 347 career wins.\n        \n            \n                Legendary former Patriots coach Bill Belichick falls short of Pro Football Hall of Fame on first ballot\n                \n                    Will Backus                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nKansas City Chiefs star quarterback Patrick Mahomes was among the names who spoke out after the repot. Mahomes posted on social that the decision was \"insane\" and that he doesn't understand \"how this could be possible.\" Notably, Mahomes and the Chiefs faced the Patriots in the 2019 AFC Championship Game. New England went on to win that game in overtime, paving the way for Belichick to win his sixth title as a head coach weeks later.\nEven NBA superstar LeBron James was confused by the report, saying that it was \"disrespectful.\"\nLawrence Taylor, whom Belichick has called the greatest defensive player in NFL history, called his former coach's exclusion from the Hall of Fame \"total bulls---.\" Taylor and Belichick won two Super Bowls together during their time with the New York Giants. \nFormer NFL defensive back Darius Butler, who played for Belichick during the 2009 and 2010 campaigns, also spoke out, citing that if he isn't a first-ballot Hall of Famer, then \"who is?\"\nFormer NFL star JJ Watt, who will be a future Hall of Famer one day, said there shouldn't be a \"single world\" that Belichick is not a \"First-Ballot Hall of Famer.\"\nFormer NFL defensive back Ryan Clark posted on social media that if Belichick isn't a first-ballot Hall of Famer, \"no coach should be.\"\nFormer NFL defensive tackle Gerald McCoy said the voters need to be made public after the former Patriots coach did not receive 40 of the 50 votes needed.\nFormer NFL quarterback Robert Griffin III said that Belichick \"earned\" the right to be a first ballot Hall of Famer. \nOne of the members of the Hall's voting committee is former NFL general manager Bill Polian. A voter, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ESPN that Polian told some voters he believed Belichick should \"wait a year\" before induction because of Spygate. The 2007 cheating scandal cost the Patriots a first-round pick and Belichick was fined $250,000. Former NFL star Terrell Owens appeared to react to the report on social media shortly after.\nFormer NFL star wide receiver Dez Bryant said he was \"lost for words.\"\nNew Orleans Saints star Cameron Jordan posted on social media that he is normally surprised when people get in the Hall of Fame, not the other way around.\nMore former Patriots players, including Julian Edelman and Jason McCourty, also reacted to the stunning news.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Eli Manning will have to wait at least one more year. The two-time Super Bowl MVP reportedly did not receive enough votes for election into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in his second year of eligibility. His snub last year did not come as a complete surprise, after all, he had a .500 record in his career and rarely was near the top of the annual passing leaderboards. On the other hand, his two Super Bowl MVPs with game-winning drives over the Patriots and Tom Brady are the stuff of legend and something you figure Canton can't live without. It's what makes up one of the most complex Hall of Fame cases ever.Why Manning was snubbed againHall of Fame quarterbacks are naturally a very elite group. These are quarterbacks with a lot of hardware who were consistently among the best quarterbacks in the game. For the most part, Manning fell well below the bar of being one of the best passers on a year in, year out basis. I looked at Manning's yearly ranks among qualified quarterbacks in a variety of stats. The comparisons range from unflattering to shocking. \nHe is nowhere close to a Hall of Fame caliber quarterback when it comes to efficiency measures. \n        \n            \n                Bill Belichick snub: Pro Football Hall of Fame issues statement, vows 'action' if voters violated bylaws\n                \n                    Bryan DeArdo                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nFirst, I looked at EPA per play (expected points added per play). He ranked 18th on average when ranking every season of his 16-year career. That's below average play! It's worse than Derek Carr. Manning finished in the top 10 three times and none in the top five. Next up, Pro Football Reference's ANY/A+ (adjusted net yards per pass attempt index). It's a mouthful, but essentially a better version of passer rating that is era adjusted, perfect for comparing Manning to both his peers and quarterbacks in the Hall of Fame. His average annual rank was 17th, or worse than Andy Dalton. The average Hall of Fame QB ranked 10th on an annual basis. \nThere's also passer rating for the dinosaurs out there! His average rank was 19th. Worse than Carson Wentz. Ouch. He had zero top-five finishes and just one top-10 finish, in 2011. The average Hall of Fame QB (I looked at 14 to debut since 1969) ranked 10th on an annual basis. None had fewer than five top-10 finishes in their career. In other words, Manning never sniffed consistent greatness in terms of efficiency and that's very far below the bar for a HOFer.HOF QBs who debuted since 1969 - Top 10 passer rating finishes:Peyton Manning: 15Joe Montana: 13Dan Marino: 12Brett Favre: 11Steve Young: 8Dan Fouts: 8Roger Staubach: 7Kurt Warner: 6Terry Bradshaw: 6Jim Kelly: 6Troy Aikman: 6Warren Moon: 6Ken Stabler: 5John Elway: 5He ranked around 10th for the year-by-year leaderboards for touchdown passes and passing yards, which is closer to the Hall of Fame average.The table below summarizes the average year-by-year ranks for Manning vs. the 14 Hall of Fame QBs to debut since 1969. It's not pretty. \nEli Manning Avg Season QB Ranks in 16-Year CareerAvg RankHOF QB AvgWorse ThanTop 10 FinishesTop 5 FinishesEPA/Play18thN/ADerek Carr30ANY/A+17th10thAndy Dalton21Passer rating19th10thCarson Wentz10Pass TD11th9thAaron Brooks72Pass yards10th9thTrent Green73The longer it takes Eli to get in the tougher it could be with other quarterbacks coming on the ballot soon. Drew Brees is a lock for this year (even if Bill Belichick wasn't a first ballot Hall of Famer). Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers and Ben Roethlisberger will also be locks. His resume is going to be compared with a group of borderline Hall of Fame quarterbacks that will be tough to judge in this passing era where everyone put up big volume numbers like Manning. Leaving Cam Newton off this comparison because his Hall of Fame resume comes down to his rushing numbers.Notable 2000s Quarterbacks on the Hall of Fame BubbleMVPTitlesPass TDPass YardsMatthew Stafford0142364,516Philip Rivers0042563,984Eli Manning0236657,023Russell Wilson0135346,966Matt Ryan1038162,792Here's a look at where each of these Hall of Fame bubble quarterbacks ranked on a yearly basis for passer rating, passing yards and passing touchdowns.

He was the passer on perhaps the craziest play in Super Bowl history (David Tyree's helmet catch) and the best throw in Super Bowl history (sideline dime to Mario Manningham). He's one of four quarterbacks with multiple game-winning drives in the Super Bowl including Tom Brady, Patrick Mahomes and Terry Bradshaw.Manning was also an ironman. He started 210 straight regular-season games, the third-longest streak by a quarterback all-time behind Brett Favre and Philip Rivers. He also retired top 10 all-time in pass touchdowns and passing yards. That will carry less weight since he played in a passing era and he will continue to be pushed further outside the top 10.So what should happen?I'm glad I don't have to make this decision. He's a slam dunk Hall of Famer in some respects and not even close in others. Stats be damned, though. It's cliche, but you can't tell the story of the NFL without Manning. He may have only had two great playoff runs but they are enough to carry him to football immortality. Also, standing in and delivering pass after pass for 210 straight starts is a Hall of Fame worthy accomplishment. Manning won't completely break the Hall of Fame mold either. Joe Namath is the last quarterback inducted with a a losing record. His average rank in passer rating was 17th (Eli was 19th). His average rank in passing touchdowns was 12th (Eli was 11th) and he was ninth in pass  yards (Eli was 10th in average rank). He rode into the Hall of Fame off \"the guarantee\", the largest upset in Super Bowl history. I don't see why Eli wouldn't eventually get in with a very similar resume and two infamous Super Bowl moments to his name. \n            ",

The former Patriots coach, who won six Super Bowls in New England, was widely expected to be a first-ballot Hall of Famer, but that won't be happening this year. So how did arguably the greatest coach in NFL history get left out? To understand that, you have to break down the voting process, which is a little complicated, so let's walk through it. There are 50 members of the Hall of Fame selection committee. The committee is made up mostly of media members, along with several Hall of Fame coaches, front-office members and players.To be enshrined this year, Belichick needed at least 40 votes.Belichick was competing with four other finalists for a spot in Canton. He was up against the three senior finalists (Ken Anderson, Roger Craig and L.C. Greenwood), along with one contributor finalist (Patriots owner Robert Kraft).Each member of the selection committee is allowed to vote for up to three candidates. Members are not asked to rank them. If a candidate's name appears on a ballot, that counts as a vote.Since Belichick didn't make it, that means he was left off at least 11 ballots.The voting is done in secret, and the Hall of Fame does not disclose how anyone votedBasically, there's no accountability or transparency in the process. CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones has called for the entire system to be blown up. \nThe Hall of Fame has a full list of the 50-person selection committee on its website, and although ballots are supposed to remain secret, several committee members have come out and revealed whether they voted for Belichick. The committee includes one media member from each city that has an NFL team (32 total). There's also one member representing the PFWA, along with 17 at-large voters. Let's take a look at the full list, including members who have publicly said they voted for Belichick, and those who have not revealed their ballots. \nCommittee members who have publicly said they voted for Belichick: Arizona: Kent Somers, retired Arizona RepublicBuffalo: Vic Carucci, WGRZ-TVChicago: Dan Pompei, The AthleticCleveland: Tony Grossi, ESPNCleveland.com/WKNR RadioDetroit: Dave Birkett, Detroit Free PressGreen Bay: Pete Dougherty, Green Bay Press-GazetteHouston: John McClain, SportsRadio610Los Angeles (Chargers): Eric Williams, Sports IllustratedMiami: Armando Salguero, Outkick.comNew York (Giants): Gary Myers, AuthorNew York (Jets): Rich Cimini, ESPN.comPhiladelphia: Paul Domowitch, The33rdTeam.com/PhillyMag.comPittsburgh: Gerry Dulac, Pittsburgh Post-GazetteSeattle: Mike Sando, The AthleticTennessee: Paul Kuharsky, PaulKuharsky.comWashington: Jarrett Bell, USA TODAYPFWA: Calvin Watkins, Dallas Morning NewsAt-Large: Mary Kay-Cabot, Cleveland Plain DealerAt-Large: Jason Cole, FanSided.comAt-Large: Lindsay Jones, The RingerAt-Large: Sal Paolantonio, ESPNAt-Large: Charean Williams, Pro Football TalkCommittee members who have publicly said they did NOT vote for Belichick:Kansas City: Vahe Gregorian, Kansas City StarCommittee members whose votes are unknown:Atlanta: Darryl Ledbetter, Atlanta Journal-ConstitutionCincinnati, Geoff Hobson, Bengals.com Dallas: Rick Gosselin, Talk of Fame NetworkDenver: Jeff Legwold, ESPN/ESPN.comIndianapolis: Mike Chappell, Fox 59/CBS 4Jacksonville: Sam Kouvaris, SamSportsLine.comLas Vegas: Paul Gutierrez, Raiders.com Los Angeles (Rams): Howard Balzer, SiriusXM NFL RadioMinnesota: Mark Craig, The Minneapolis Star-TribuneNew England: Ron Borges, Talk of Fame NetworkNew Orleans: Jeff Duncan, Times-PicayuneSan Francisco: Matt Maiocco, NBC Sports Bay AreaTampa Bay: Ira Kaufman, JoeBucsFan.comAt-Large: Joe Bussert, retired, NFL OfficeAt-Large: Frank Cooney, The Sports XchangeAt-Large: Tony Dungy, NBC Sports \"Football Night in America\" (Hall of Famer)At-Large: Dan Fouts, Broadcaster (Hall of Famer)At-Large: Clark Judge, Talk of Fame NetworkAt-Large: Ross Ketover, NFL FilmsAt-Large: James Lofton, CBS Sports (Hall of Famer)At-Large: Alex Marvez, SiriusXM NFL RadioAt-Large: Bill Polian, SiriusXM NFL Radio (Hall of Famer)At-Large: Lisa Salters, ESPN At-Large: Jim Trotter, retired, The AthleticAt-Large: Barry Wilner, retired, Associated PressCommittee members who won't be revealing their voteCarolina: Darin Gantt, Carolina PanthersBaltimore: Scott Garceau, 105.7 The Fan/WMAR-TVOut of the group of 50, more than 20 members have already come out and said they voted for Belichick.We also know that at least 11 voters did NOT vote for him. Mike Sando of The Athletic outlined how that might have happened: Some voters could have been turned off by the Spygate allegations, while others might have prioritized the senior candidates, who may not make the final ballot next year. It's also possible some voters weren't thrilled with the recent rule change that made former coaches eligible after just one year out of the league. CBS Sports NFL researcher Doug Clawson also came up with some theories about why certain voters might have left Belichick off their ballots. It's not just Spygate -- there was also Deflategate. And let's not forget, the Patriots were fined $1.1 million for filming the Bengals sideline in 2019. \n\n        \n            \n                Bill Belichick snubbed by Hall of Fame: We now can't rule out the possibility of Tom Brady meeting same fate\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThen there's the Bill Polian factor. In a story Tuesday, ESPN reported that Polian tried to convince a few other voters that Belichick deserved to wait at least one year as a punishment for Spygate. The former Colts general manager told Sports Illustrated on Tuesday that he definitely voted for Belichick, but then backtracked later in the night, telling ESPN that he was 95% sure he voted for him. The Hall of Fame vote took place Jan. 13, and if Polian can't remember after just two weeks, that opens up another set of issues. The only committee member who has publicly admitted to leaving Belichick off his ballot is Vahe Gregorian of the Kansas City Star, who wrote an article explaining why he left the the six-time Super Bowl winner off his ballot. \n\"I didn't vote against Belichick or Kraft. I voted for the three senior candidates: Ken Anderson, Roger Craig and L.C. Greenwood,\" Gregorian wrote. As Sando mentioned, there was almost certainly going to be a faction of voters who prioritized getting the senior nominees in and that's what Gregorian did. For the senior nominees, this could be their last shot at making the Hall of Fame and that clearly factored into Gregorian's decision. On the other hand, Belichick will almost certainly be a finalist next year, so Gregorian didn't feel pressed to put him in this year whether he was deserving or not. If other voters went the same route as Gregorian, then Belichick not getting in is less of a snub and more of a flaw in the selection process. And if that's the case, then the Hall will need to think long and hard about the process going forward. \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Teams hoping to finally put together a winning streak will meet on 'Monday Night Football' as the San Francisco 49ers host the Carolina Panthers. San Fran (7-4) has alternated wins and losses over its last nine games and is coming off a 41-22 victory over Arizona in Week 11. Carolina (6-5) has alternated wins and losses over its last five contests, most recently knocking off Atlanta, 30-27 in overtime, on Sunday.

Carolina has covered in five of six games versus NFC opponents in 2025, and its MNF opponent has major defensive holes. The Niners can neither get to the quarterback nor take the ball away as they rank dead last in defensive sacks and also have the second-fewest picks. That should bring comfort to Young in the pocket, while he also has the league's No. 4 rusher in Rico Dowdle to lean on.

Against Boise State, he threw for a season-high 293 yards and two touchdowns, but he also threw three interceptions while completing just 56.5% of his passes in his first collegiate start. \nWorse than that, he was caught spitting on Boise State defensive end Jayden Virgin-Morgan after one of his interceptions. \nWortmann -- who has started all 11 games at right guard this season -- spent just one season with Colorado State after spending four seasons at Division II Central Missouri. His season has also come to an abrupt end after he was also caught spitting on a Boise State player. It's been a tough season for the Rams, who fired former head coach Jay Norvell after a 2-5 start. The Rams, who have dropped their last four games, are currently 126th in the nation in points scored and 107th in points allowed. \nColorado State will finish the season against an Air Force team that is also hoping to end what has been a forgettable season on a high note. The Falcons are 3-8 after a 1-6 start to the season. \n            \n    ",

Despite a match in which Cristian Chivu's side pushed hard—especially in the first half, when Francesco Acerbi and Lautaro Martinez both hit the post, AC Milan capitalized on a fast transition, with the American international scoring after a poor save from Yann Sommer. The Nerazzurri tried to at least equalize but even Hakan Calhanoglu missed his second-ever penalty since he joined the Italian Serie A, which was saved by Mike Maignan, who was voted MVP of the match after making two incredible saves in the first half on Marcus Thuram and Lautaro. AC Milan are now only two points behind AS Roma, the leaders of the standings, who next week will face Napoli at the Stadio Olimpico, while Inter are now three points behind the Giallorossi. Let's take a look at the winning goal scored by Pulisic:  \nThe American striker was once again the star of the night in Milan and scored his fifth goal of the Serie A season in eight matches played so far, and he started against Inter for the first time this season alongside Rafael Leao, which was the initial plan of manager Massimiliano Allegri before both players struggled with injuries in the first part of the season. Pulisic showed to be ready after he recovered from the injury, as he also missed the international break with the USMNT to prepare ahead of his comeback in Italy and immediately proved again to be a pivotal player for the Serie A giants. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Las Vegas have fired offensive coordinator Chip Kelly following Sunday's 24-10 loss to the Cleveland Browns. The loss dropped the Raiders to 2-9 on the season. \"I spoke with with Chip Kelly earlier this evening and informed him of his release as offensive coordinator of the Raiders,\" Raiders coach Pete Carroll said in a statement. \"I would like to thank Chip for his service and wish him all the best in the future.\" Kelly, 61, was on the job for less than a year. Sunday's game marked the sixth time this year that the Raiders' offense failed to score at least 20 points. Over its past three games, Las Vegas scored just 7, 16 and 10 points, respectively.Kelly is the second assistant coach the Raiders have fired this season. The team parted ways with former special teams coach Tom McMahon following their Week 10 loss to Denver. Sunday was largely a microcosm of the Raiders' offense this season. Against the Browns, the Raiders had just 268 total yards, were 4 of 17 on third down and had just one trip inside Cleveland's 20-yard line. Quarterback Geno Smith was sacked a whopping 10 times, while first-round pick Ashton Jeanty was held to 50 yards on 17 carries. \nThe Raiders' offense entered Sunday's game ranked 30th in the NFL in scoring, 25th in passing, 30th in rushing and in red zone efficiency, and 21st in third-down efficiency. While Kelly surely deserves some blame, it wasn't like he and the Raiders' offense was set up to have much success this season. In fact, the team traded one of their few proven skill players -- wideout Jakobi Meyers -- before the trade deadline. The Raiders have also continuously received spotty play from Smith, who despite his struggles has continued to get the support of Carroll. Kelly was fresh off of winning a national title with Ohio State before returning to the NFL. Prior to the Raiders and Ohio State, Kelly was UCLA's head coach from 2018-23. He was the Eagles' head coach from 2013-15 before spending one season as the 49ers coach. \nKelly's coaching breakthrough occurred at Oregon, where he spent two years as offensive coordinator before being promoted to head coach. He led the Ducks to a Rose Bowl victory in 2011 and a Fiesta Bowl win in 2012.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Dallas Wings have won the 2026 WNBA Draft Lottery and will have the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 WNBA Draft next spring. This is the second year in a row that the Wings have won the top pick. Last year they selected Paige Bueckers, who went on to win 2025 WNBA Rookie of the Year. Franchises winning the No. 1 pick in back-to-back years has become a trend in the WNBA over the last decade. The Wings are the fourth team to have back-to-back No. 1 picks since 2015, joining the Seattle Storm (2015, 2016), Las Vegas Aces (2017, 2018, 2019) and Indiana Fever (2023, 2024). The Wings had the best odds to receive the top pick at 42%, so it was no surprise when they won. In fact, the lottery wound up going chalk. The Minnesota Lynx will pick No. 2, followed by the Storm, Washington Mystics and Chicago Sky. Per the WNBA, this is the fifth time in league history that the lottery results matched the order of chances held by the lottery teams. 2026 WNBA Draft first round orderNote: The expansion Tempo and Fire will be slotted in after the lottery. A coin flip will determine which team picks No. 6 and which team picks No. 7. \nDallas WingsMinnesota Lynx (via Chicago)Seattle Storm (via Los Angeles)Washington MysticsChicago Sky (via Connecticut)Toronto Tempo/Portland FireToronto Tempo/Portland FireGolden State ValkyriesWashington Mystics (via Seattle)Indiana FeverWashington Mystics (via New York)Connecticut Sun (via Phoenix)Atlanta DreamSeattle Storm (via Las Vegas)Connecticut Sun (via Minnesota)Unlike the past two years, when Cailtin Clark and Paige Bueckers were the clear top prospects, there is no consensus No. 1 pick in this year's class -- at least not right now. Spanish center Awa Fam has the most upside, but she is only 19 years old and no international player has gone No. 1 since Lauren Jackson in 2001. UCLA center Lauren Betts will also receive consideration for the top pick, and there are a number of talented guards, including TCU's Olivia Miles, who could play their way into the mix. Now that the lottery is in the books and the draft order is set, let's take a look at some winners and losers from the night's results. Winner: WingsThis is an obvious one, but the Wings are the biggest winner of the night. This is the second year in a row that the franchise has had the top pick, and the third time since 2021. In the 2025 WNBA Draft, the Wings took former UConn star Paige Bueckers, who went on to have a historic rookie season and established herself as a franchise cornerstone. \nThere's no clear choice this time around, but it's always exciting to control the board and the Wings are still thrilled with their luck. On ESPN's broadcast, analyst Chiney Ogwumike said she sent a text to Wings general manager Curt Miller, who responded with three letters: \"LFG.\" Aside from the addition of Bueckers, nothing went to plan for the Wings in 2025. They were beset by injuries, ended up trading NaLyssa Smith and DiJonai Carrington and finished in last place at 10-34, which tied the league's single-season losses record. First-year coach Chris Koclanes, who appeared out of his depth, was fired soon after their campaign came to an end. As bad as 2025 was, there's plenty of hope for the future in Dallas, especially after winning the lottery again. Bueckers is already an All-WNBA caliber player, fellow rookies Aziaha James and JJ Quinerly showed some flashes and former lottery picks Maddy Siegrist and Diamond Miller are signed for 2026. Bringing in a player like Fam, who makes a lot of sense for the Wings, would give them an exciting young core. \nOff the court, Miller is one of the most well-respected executives in the league and new coach Jose Fernandez comes highly regarded for the work he did at the collegiate level with South Florida. Add in a new practice facility, which is expected to open before the 2026 season starts, and things are finally looking up in Dallas. \nLoser: SkyThe Sky only had a 5.5% chance at winning the top pick, and the most likely outcome was always that they would wind up at No. 5. Still, Sunday's result highlighted the mess that the franchise is in. Ever since their 2022 playoff collapse, the Sky have made a series of short-sighted, win-now moves that have resulted in a combined 41-83 record over the last three seasons, one playoff appearance and zero playoff wins. Last season, they went 10-34 to tie the league's single-season losses mark. \nDespite such an abysmal record, the Sky were lucky to even be in the lottery. They owe their 2026 first-round pick to the Lynx, who wound up with the No. 2 selection thanks to the Sky's odds. If not for a pair of separate deals with the Sun and Mercury, which allowed the Sky to swap first-round picks with the Sun, they wouldn't have had a lottery pick. The Sky can still add a good player. There is an abundance of backcourt talent in this class -- Olivia Miles, Azzi Fudd, Flau'jae Johnson and Ta'Niya Latson -- and Chicago still needs a guard for the future after trading the No. 3 pick in last year's draft (Sonia Citron) for Ariel Atkins. But at No. 5, they won't have their choice of the bunch. Once again, the Sky's future options have been limited by their past mistakes. Winner: LynxThe Lynx went 34-10 last season to tie the league's single-season wins record, and were the clear favorites to win the title until they suffered a playoff collapse -- partially due to key injuries to Napheesa Collier and DiJonai Carrington -- in the second round against the Mercury. \nIt goes without saying that the Lynx are not a typical lottery team, but thanks to a series of trades with the Sky, they own Chicago's 2026 first-round pick. As a result, the Lynx will select in the lottery for the first time since 2023, and will have a chance to add a top talent to one of the league's top rosters (assuming they re-sign the majority of their core in free agency). At No. 2, the Lynx will have plenty of choices. One of Fam or Betts is guaranteed to be available, and the Lynx could use additional frontcourt depth. And if they want to bolster their backcourt, the likes of Olivia Miles, Azzi Fudd and Flau'jae Johnson could all help their cause immediately. Furthermore, plenty of teams would be eager to trade up and take the Lynx's spot, and Minnesota could look to orchestrate a trade for a more established player(s). Whatever happens in April, the Lynx are going to be even better in 2026, and that's bad news for the rest of the league. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        ARLINGTON, Texas – The Dallas Cowboys' 2025 season was on life support after falling behind 21-0 with 11:32 left in the first half on Sunday.However, Dallas' defense shut out the Philadelphia Eagles (8-3), who entered Week 12 as the NFC's No. 1 seed, the rest of the way, which allowed the offense to rip off 24 consecutive points en route to a 24-21 win -- tying a franchise record for the biggest comeback in the process.How monumental was this victory? Dallas owner and general manager Jerry Jones felt it was future-altering weeks after Jones decided to be a buyer at the trade deadline by acquiring All-Pro defensive tackle Quinnen Williams and veteran linebacker Logan Wilson.That support, along with linebacker DeMarvion Overshown and cornerback Shavon Revel returning from injury, gave quarterback Dak Prescott (354 yards, two touchdowns, one interception and one rushing touchdown), wide receiver George Pickens (146 yards receiving, one touchdown, nine catches on nine targets) and wide receiver CeeDee Lamb (75 yards receiving on four catches) a boost that could carry them the rest of the season and beyond.\n\"This day had such meaning for our season. This day had such meaning for our future. Earlier, this year, we had a chance to go down a couple of roads. We took one of the roads, and we did it because we were fortunate to have Dak [Prescott] in the future. But the other road, we needed to do some recalibrating,\" Jones said postgame. \"Fortunately, we were able to do that earlier than I thought after we couldn't make the trade we wanted [trading for Williams] in training camp, but we got it [the deal for Williams] back. We got a defense, really really impressive tonight. … I think we can look forward to this kind of solidness in our defense, but … what you're seeing on defense is different than what we would have seen coming out of training camp.\"Fresh off a 33-16 Week 11 \"Monday Night Football\" road win at the Las Vegas Raiders, Dallas had legitimate momentum entering Week 12. The Eagles entered Week 12 with a league-average offense (23.4 points per game, 16th in the NFL) with wide receiver A.J. Brown making sure the world knew he's not happy with Philadelphia's passing offense. Early on, instead of capitalizing on the Eagles zombie-walking of late, the Cowboys continuously made self-inflicted wounds that dug a hole that was near-impossible to climb out from.\"I don't know when we've ever, early, worked any harder to have a team hand us a loss, but to this team's credit, I'm so proud of that defense, and when you really look at what that defense helped overcome for us, you've got to be excited about what we've got out here,\" Jones said. … \"In four days, we'll be playing again, and they [the players] can't wait. I can't wait to play again.\"\nHere's a look at the Cowboys' laundry list of unforced errors:  Prescott couldn't connect on a fourth-and-3 checkdown throw to running back Javonte Williams after he missed locating an open Jake Ferguson up the seam after Eagles linebacker Zack Baun fell down attempting to cover Dallas' tight end. Cowboys wide receiver Ryan Flournoy missed blocking a punt and then linebacker Marist Liufau was called for roughing the kicker after Dallas' defense got a stop. After the Liufau penalty, edge rusher Jadeveon Clowney was called offsides on a third-and-10 in which Hurts threw an incomplete pass. On the next play, Hurts hit Brown over the middle for a 21-yard gain. Hurts finished the drive with a 7-yard rushing touchdown to put Philadelphia up 14-0. Wide receiver KaVontae Turpin fumbled without being touched thanks to getting caught up by the turf monster, and then the Eagles marched down the field on six-play drive to tush push Hurts into the end zone to put the Eagles up 21-0. Prescott threw an end zone interception on a target to Lamb that Eagles safety Reed Blankenship picked off on a diving grab. Kicker Brandon Aubrey missed a 51-yard field goal, just his second miss (18-for-20) of the entire season. Dallas failed to score on third-and-goal and fourth-and-goal from the 1.Plus, the Cowboys' defense functioned as quarterback Jalen Hurts' and the Eagles' offense's slumpbuster early. Brown had spoken about how people who have him in fantasy football should get rid of him because of year-long struggles for Hurts and the Eagles offense to find him. Hurts had no problem finding Brown early, hitting him for three completions, 31 yards and a touchdown on his first three targets on the opening drive. He finished the game with 110 yards and a touchdown on eight catches. Hurts was also able to connect deep with wide receiver DeVonta Smith on a 41-yard bomb down the right sideline, and Smith finished with 89 yards receiving on six catches. What really made the difference defensively was how Dallas was able to bottle up 2024 NFL Offensive Player of the Year running back Saquon Barkley. Barkley had just 22 yards rushing on 10 carries, including just 11 yards after Philadelphia went up 21-0. That's why Jones made the trade for Williams: he entered Week 12 with a 47% run stop win rate, which led all NFL defensive tacklers per Next Gen Stats. Williams himself said postgame that one person can't change everything, but that's exactly what's happened since his arrival.\"We had to have something at this level of excellence on run stopping that he brought to the table. We had to have that,\" Jones said. \"We didn't need to give up pass rush to get it, and we knew since before we left training camp that he could do that.\"\n\"Just appreciating the way he's [Williams] coming in with the energy and confidence, speaking life into the defense, into the D-line room,\" Cowboys defensive tackle Osa Odighizuwa said. \"It's very much needed and very much appreciated.\"The Cowboys overcame all of the errors to steal a victory from the jaws of defeat because their offense was able to get going once their defense began slowing things down on the other side of the ball. Both Pickens and Lamb made catches of over 40 yards to reignite Dallas' offense. Pickens caught the first Cowboys touchdown of the day, a 1-yarder in the front of the end zone off a play-action pass, at the end of the first half. Prescott then followed up that score with a 4-yard play-action touchdown pass on a play-action rollout to tight end Brevyn Spann-Ford, the first touchdown of his career, before scrambling and diving in for the game-tying score from 8 yards out with 11:40 left to play. Cowboys edge rusher Sam Williams forced a Barkley fumble at the end of a checkdown catch-and-run, and Dallas linebacker Kenneth Murray recovered the loose ball for the takeaway. Dallas had an opportunity to take their first lead of the day with 7:38 left to play. However, a holding penalty by rookie right guard Tyler Booker derailed the drive.\nThen, Dallas was immediately gifted another shot with a first-and-goal from the 7 after a fumble on the Eagles' ensuing punt return was recovered by Cowboys long snapper Trent Sieg. After reaching the 1, the Cowboys turned it over on downs following Prescott's consecutive incompletions to Lamb and Ferguson. The third-and-goal pass to Lamb could have and should have been a catch as he had the ball on his forearm before it popped up and fell harmlessly to the turf. Instead of kicking a chip shot field goal for the lead, coach Brian Schottenheimer went for the touchdown, and his decision backfired. Yet, the Cowboys still got the football back with a chance to win the game after Odighizuwa came up with a third-down sack of Hurts. They got the football back on their own 27 in a 21-21 game with 1:35 left to play and two timeouts. Pickens' catch-and-run of 24 yards down to the Eagles' 22 put Dallas in a prime position to line up Aubrey for the game-winning field goal from 42 yards out, which he drilled through the uprights.Dallas has the offensive firepower with Prescott, Williams, Lamb and Pickens to move the football up and down the field. Defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus' zone-heavy scheme is taking hold with the Cowboys' personnel being upgraded. The Cowboys find themselves in the hunt for postseason football for another week. \n\"It was needed. Never blinked, never had any doubts and 1000% believed from the beginning. ... We believed long enough and got ourselves back in this game and now you have to know. That's just a testimony to this brotherhood, sticking together,\" Prescott said. \"Going down 21 to the defending Super Bowl champs in a division game is tough. I'm sure there were fans thinking this game was over, and they're [the Eagles] were going to run off.\"Defense, I can't give them enough credit. We wouldn't have won this game without the opportunities they gave us over and over again. ... It was just a continuation of what we did last week and just sticking together. Like I said, it's about the brotherhood. Once again, we're always going to do it for Marshawn Kneeland and he was felt tonight. I'm sure he was right there playing alongside with us.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        In Week 12, several players jumped on the Fantasy Football radar. This could be the start of something special for some of these players, and you'll want to get well ahead of your Week 13 Fantasy Football waiver wire by putting these players on your radar. For more on every player we discuss below, you'll want to make sure to check out Jamey Eisenberg's in-depth waiver wire column on Monday afternoon.Dylan Sampson, RB, BrownsThe Browns haven't decided on a starting quarterback for Week 13 just yet, but it would be unlikely they don't stick with Shedeur Sanders. That is great news for Sampson. One thing the Browns are going to focus on with Sanders at quarterback is providing him with easy outlets in the pass game. Sanders has taken very first first-team reps and he hasn't seen many plays at NFL speed (preseason isn't the same speed). Screen passes and designed quick hitters to Sampson will serve as an extension of the run game they intend to lean on. Sampson has proven himself an explosive playmaker from earlier this season and I have a sneaky suspicion he might become a player with a role in a Sanders-led offense. I'm stashing him this week in 12-team leagues or deeper.Shedeur Sanders, QB, BrownsSanders' raw stat line looks a lot better than his EPA per play, but raw stats play in Fantasy Football and as long as he can hit a few explosive plays each game then he is at the very least worth monitoring. I'm waiting for this week to confirm it on the All-22, but it feels pretty obvious Sanders should have been starting over Dillon Gabriel weeks ago. I say that as someone skeptical of Sanders' ceiling. It's more of an indictment of Gabriel. But Sanders does do a few things that are Fantasy friendly. He can create off script throws downfield because he keeps his eyes up when he's breaking pocket. He is also a lot more accurate than Gabriel which will lead to more plays like the long gain to Jerry Jeudy where he broke pocket, reset his feet and then relied on his mechanics to deliver the ball accurately downfield. I've watched Gabriel miss these throws all season. Sanders has enough on offense and a budding rapport with Sampson. I wouldn't add him in leagues that start just one quarterback just yet.\nCam Ward, QB, TitansWelcome to the Fantasy Football world Mr. No. 1 overall pick Cam Ward! We've seen flashes before this season, but Ward put together a strong second half and it translated to his breakout Fantasy performance of his rookie season. Ward racked up 256 passing yards and a touchdown and he ran more. Ward finished with six carries for 37 rushing yards and a touchown. He was the fifth-highest scoring Fantasy QB heading into Sunday Night Football. Ward may have some late season value in 2QB and SuperFlex leagues. John Metchie, WR, JetsIt's the Tyrod Taylor era for the Jets -- at least for now -- and he certainly likes to get Metchie involved. Metchie finished Week 12 with six receptions on seven targets for 65 yards and a score. For now, he's just a stash. Metchie could work his way into the WR3 range in specific plus matchups if he can continue to build his rapport out with Taylor. \nDarnell Mooney, WR, FalconsThis one only applies to shallow leagues, but if Mooney is still on your waiver wire, fix that. He is and has always been a favorite of Kirk Cousins. Their rapport will continue to grow with more practice reps. Mooney is a threat to score on any touch. Cousins can still get the ball out on time -- well at least some of the time -- despite some of the physical traits dropping off.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Concluding a week in which much more than a trophy was on the line, Sami Valimaki successfully battled nerves and pressure to accomplish a career first at the 2025 RSM Classic. The 27-year-old Finn kept a crowded chasing pack at bay Sunday in Sea Island, Georgia, to enter the winner's circle for the first time in his PGA Tour career at 23 under, one stroke clear of Max McGreevy.Valimaki is the first Finnish man to win on the PGA Tour and represents the 17th first-time winner this season, a total that clocks as the second most in a single season since 1983. He also follows in the footsteps of Ludvig Åberg and Maverick McNealy as the fifth straight first-time winner to emerge at the RSM Classic.Already locked into full-time playing privileges in 2026 as he started the PGA Tour season finale at No. 74 in the FedEx Cup standings, Valimaki understood there was still work to be done. With invitations into signature events and major championships on the line, the big-hitting righty punched his ticket into multiple big-time events to open up next year's campaign.With the win, Valimaki jumped to No. 51 in the FedEx Cup standings. His last three results of the year: T2 at the World Wide Technology Championship, T18 at the Bermuda Championship and now a victory at the RSM Classic. The climb inside the Aon Next 10 -- Nos. 51-60 in the standings -- means he will tee it up in the first two signature events of 2026, as well as the PGA Championship and RBC Heritage.\nCommanding the first 54-hole lead of his career, Valimaki looked unflappable from the start of the final round. Two clear of playing competitors Michael Thorbjornsen and Patrick Rodgers, the overnight leader made his presence known early on Sunday with birdies on Nos. 2 and 4.Charges never ultimately materialized from those two but rather a pair of players in an earlier grouping. Ricky Castillo carded two birdies in his first four holes before penciling five straight birdies onto his scorecard to round out the front nine. The former Florida Gators star tied the front-nine scoring record, turned in 28 and suddenly had a chance to save his season with nine holes to go. Castillo dropped a shot on No. 12 but bounced back with birdies on Nos. 15-16 to post the early clubhouse lead at 21 under.\"I haven't really had a lot of good final rounds this year, so it was really nice to have my best round of the year be on the final round of the final tournament,\" Castillo said. \"Pretty crazy. But yeah, really just happy to shoot a good score and give myself a chance to keep my card.\n\"Honestly, I was trying to win the golf tournament. In my mindset, coming down 18, I wanted to give myself a chance to win the golf tournament. If I win this tournament, yeah, I keep my Tour card, but yeah, regardless of what happens, I was just trying to give myself the best chance. That's what we come out here to do: We try to win tournaments. We're not trying to finish second; we're all trying to win.\"Castillo's 62 was enough to project his name inside the number as he walked off the last hole, but it would not end up there as McGreevy rolled in a 30-foot birdie bomb on the 18th green to push it back outside the top 100. McGreevy's birdie bumped Castillo's name down to third on the leaderboard, giving him the clubhouse lead at 22 under thanks to three birdies in his final five holes and a final-round 63.\nHe was not the only player to find heartbreak on the final hole, however. McGreevy's finish was enough for him to sneak inside the Aon Next 10 as well, pushing Jordan Spieth outside the number to start the year. Meanwhile, McGreevy's playing partner, Lee Hodges, had his fate in his hands coming down the last as well.\nHodges kept plugging along and arrived at the final hole of his season in need of a birdie to keep his PGA Tour card. He split the fairway, found the green in regulation and faced a 10-foot birdie bid that ultimately slid on the low side and never had a chance.Hodges finished the season No. 101 in the FedEx Cup standings, while Castillo was one worse at No. 102 after entering the week far off the pace at 135th in the season-long race. With Hodges and Castillo unable to eke inside the bubble, Takumi Kanaya, who came to Sea Island at No. 99, remained in the same position despite missing the cut. Karl Vilips, who was already exempt thanks to his Puerto Rico Open win, was the man to finish at the magic number.\"I hate to hear that I was the one that did that,\" McGreevy said. \"I'm playing alongside Lee, who's one of my good friends. We came out on PGA Tour together in '21, and I'm pulling for him to make that putt just as much as I was for myself to make that putt. \n\"It's little successes and defeats. Whether it's a defeat to Ricky or Lee or something like that, they both still played great rounds, gave themself that chance, and that's all they can rely on is to give themself an opportunity. And they did. Hopefully, both those guys, Ricky and Lee, can take care of business either at Q-School or next year with some starts for sure, and yeah, play good golf.\"\nWith those players competing for their livelihoods off the golf course, Valimaki commanded the spotlight and made his move on the par-5 15th. Finding the surface in two thanks to a beautiful mini driver from the right side of the fairway, he added a much-needed birdie following McGreevy's heroics on the last.A par save from 18 feet followed on the very next hole, and he put the tournament on ice soon after as he was able to find the final two greens in regulation to secure his maiden title and the first for his native country of Finland.\n            ",

CBS Sports first reported the news of Wilcox's firing earlier in the day. The school owes Wilcox $10,879,167 in buyout money, according to USA Today's college football coaching salary database. The Golden Bears are 6-5 this season but just suffered an embarrassing 31-10 loss to rival Stanford in Week 13. Former Washington State coach Nick Rolovich, currently a senior offensive assistant with the Bears, will be the interim coach. \"I want to thank Justin for all of his contributions to our football program, our athletic department and our university,\" Cal general manager Ron Rivera said in a statement. \"He has always comported himself with class and professionalism. After careful consideration, we believe the time has come for new leadership. We wish Justin the best of luck in his future endeavors.\"\nIt's been an uneven year overall for Cal. It began the season 3-0 with a lot of momentum thanks to the presence of freshman quarterback Jaron-Keawe Sagapolutele. Things have been much more uneven since, however. The Bears were blown out 34-0 by San Diego State in nonconference play, and they're just 3-4 on the season in the ACC. Wilcox, 49, was once considered one of the top up-and-coming coaches on the West Coast -- so much so he was a candidate for Oregon when Mario Cristobal left the program following the 2021 season. It's been a difficult run for Wilcox in the time since. The Bears haven't produced a winning season since 2019, and they're just 22-27 over the last four seasons. \nCal currently has a pair of interim athletic directors. It's expected that Rivera will have a large say in the upcoming coaching search to replace Wilcox. \n            \n    ",

But it does happen. And my official guess: It happens this week for a third time this season when the rankings refresh on Monday. And again, it will be Purdue that loses the No. 1 spot despite remaining undefeated, if indeed voters make the switch.The preseason No. 1 Boilermakers fell from No. 1 to No. 2 in Week 2 despite a 2-0 start with double digit wins over Evansville and Oakland -- surmounted by then-No. 2 Houston jumping one spot. Purdue reclaimed the No. 1 ranking last week after defeating Alabama and Akron. But they're positioned to fall back from No. 1 again, as you can gather by this predictive diatribe now, despite a perfect 2-0 week that featured wins over Memphis and Texas Tech.\nArizona's just been that good. Two wins over top-25 teams were on its resume entering the week after defeating then-No. 3. Florida on opening day and No. 15 UCLA last week, good enough to potentially give it the best resume in the sport. That put the Wildcats at No. 4 in last week's rankings. A true road win Wednesday over No. 3 UConn has them poised to leap again. And there should be no doubt about which team has the best resume in college basketball.I don't think it'll be unanimous, to be clear. Voters who had Purdue at No. 1 may keep it at No. 1, the idea being you have to quite literally lose a game to lose the No. 1 ranking. Houston and Duke may even continue to earn first-place votes. But at the very least, Arizona, which earned two first-place votes last week, will have at least significantly cut into Purdue's grip at No. 1, if not outright taking the spot.\nI'm just the messenger. That's not my argument nor how I'd necessarily approach the topic. But every week I predict how AP voters will react to the week's results. And that -- along with the below top 25 -- is my official prediction.1\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    Two wins over teams ranked No. 3 and another win over a team ranked No. 15. Yeah, that'll do. It's the best resume in college basketball, and it should be enough to make the Wildcats No. 1 on Monday.

It has a road win over No. 8 Alabama and a weekend win in the Baha Mar championship over No. 15 Texas Tech, 86-56. Yes: Purdue blasted Texas Tech by 30 points.

    "body": "\n        The Cleveland Browns picked up their third victory of the season in Sunday's game against the Las Vegas Raiders as Shedeur Sanders delivered a 24-10 victory in the rookie's first career start. Sanders became the first Browns quarterback since 1995 to win his first start. Previously, Browns quarterbacks went 0-17 in their first starts dating back to 1999. Cleveland's last quarterback to win his first career start was Eric Zeier, who was coached by Bill Belichick. He defeated the Cincinnati Bengals in overtime, 29-26. The franchise moved to Baltimore the next year. Sanders completed 11 of 20 passes for 209 yards, one touchdown and one interception. It was an offensive rookie showcase in a way, as Quinshon Judkins rushed for 47 yards and two touchdowns, while Dylan Sampson caught Sanders' lone touchdown -- a 66-yard catch-and-run. The reason the Browns won this game was because of their defensive effort, as Jim Schwartz's unit held the Raiders to 268 total yards, one touchdown and sacked Geno Smith a whopping 10 times. Myles Garrett recorded three total sacks, meaning he's just now five sacks away from the all-time record with six games left to play. \nLet's take a look back at Sanders' first NFL start:Confidence before the gameRight before kickoff CBS Sports' Tiffany Blackmon caught up with Sanders, and asked him what this opportunity feels like.\"Feels good,\" Sanders said. \"We cool, calm, collected. Like, this ain't nothing to us.\" When Blackmon asked Sanders what he hopes to show the NFL world today, he didn't mince his words:\n\"I'm who they been lookin' for,\" Sanders said.\nThe first halfThe Browns took a 14-3 halftime lead in large part due to their defense, which sacked Smith five times. In all, Sanders completed 7 of 11 passes for 127 yards and one interception in the first two quarters.The Browns jumped out to a 7-0 lead after an impressive, 44-yard punt return from Gage Larvadain. Judkins took advantage of the short field, and punched in an 8-yard touchdown from the wildcat formation.\nLate in the first quarter, Sanders connected with fellow rookie Isaiah Bond on a 53-yard pass to set the Browns up with a first-and-goal from the two-yard line. \nGarrett was certainly impressed with the throw.\nAs was Sanders' father!\nFrom there, Kevin Stefanski again called a play from the wildcat formation, and Judkins scored his second touchdown of the game to put Cleveland up 14-0.\nSanders then made his first major mistake, throwing an interception to Charles Snowden, who was in zone coverage, while attempting to connect with Jerry Jeudy. However, the Browns defense stood tall and held the Raiders to a 41-yard field goal. \nOne thing we noticed from the Browns' offensive game plan this week with Sanders at quarterback is to roll him out of the pocket. The rookie has a tendency to drift in the pocket and hold onto the ball too long, so this was a point of emphasis from Stefanski.\nLate in the second quarter, Sanders rolled right and hit Jeudy deep for a massive gain. However, the wideout didn't know where he was on the field, was hit by Jeremy Chinn from behind and fumbled the ball. \nThe second halfThe Browns punted four times in the second half and put together two scoring drives. In the fourth quarter, Sanders threw his first career touchdown -- a swing pass to Sampson, who scurried 66 yards to virtually put the game away. \nIt wasn't the most perfect game in the world, but Sanders only made one major miscue in the form of his interception early in the second quarter. He managed the game, and allowed the defense to take over. Another noteworthy statistic from this game was that Sanders was only sacked once. As a prospect, his tendency to drift backwards in the pocket and set himself up for sacks was worrisome, but we didn't see too much of that on Sunday. \nTruth be told, despite the win, Sanders likely didn't do enough to steal the job away from Dillon Gabriel, who was selected by Cleveland above Sanders in this past draft. When Stefanski was asked if Sanders would start next week against the San Francisco 49ers, he said he wasn't \"going to get into that.\"\"Proud of him, and proud of this offense and there are a ton of things to learn from, but I'm just going to worry about today,\" Stefanski said. \nStefanski also praised Sanders for his work ethic and desire to get better. \nAs for the Browns' quarterback situation, Gabriel is currently in the concussion protocol, and all players recover from head injuries differently. If Gabriel clears protocol this week, it could set the Browns up with an interesting decision. \n            ",

They're behind the Philadelphia Eagles in the race for the conference's top seed by virtue of a head-to-head loss, but they are tied for the best record in the NFC. They have a chance to keep the good times rolling here, as a win would mark their six consecutive victory since they lost two out of three in Weeks 3 through 5.Bet Buccaneers vs. Rams at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $150 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:Tampa has lost two in a row and three of its last four and has seen its lead in the NFC South cut to just a half-game. The Bucs remain banged up, with Mike Evans and Bucky Irving, among others, still out for this game and with no firm timeline for their respective returns. The have a significantly softer stretch of schedule coming up to end the season, with this being the toughest game remaining on their schedule.\nWill the Rams continue stacking wins, or will the Bucs get back on the horse? We'll find out soon enough. But before we give you a few key things to know about the matchup, here's a look at how you can watch the game. Where to watch Rams vs. Bucs liveDate: Sunday, Nov. 23 | Time: 8:20 p.m. ETWhere: SoFi Stadium (Inglewood, California)TV: NBC Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Rams -6.5; O/U 49.5 (via DraftKings Sportsbook)Bet Rams vs. Bucs and other NFL Week 12 games at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass with a winning $5 wager.\nRams vs. Bucs: Need to knowStafford set up for success: The Bucs have a pass-funnel defense that is far better against the run than it is against the pass, which typically pushes opponents into pass-happy game plans. The Bucs are second in opponents' rushing success rate, via Tru Media, and only 20th in passing success rate. With Puka Nacua in the slot and Davante Adams on the outside, the Rams have two obvious passing-game mismatches. This game sets up well for Stafford. Bucs looking to bounce back: Tampa has lost two in a row to AFC East opponents, falling in back-to-back games to the Patriots and the Bills. When you go back to before their bye, they have lost three of their last four, with the lone win during that stretch coming against the Saints. (They also lost to the Lions.) They have wins over the Seahawks and Niners this year, but of late they have struggled against the high-level teams. They have a chance to reverse that trend here before moving into a stretch run where they won't be tested with nearly as tough of matchups. Important injuries: Not only are Mike Evans and Bucky Irving out for Tampa, but Quentin Lake is out for Los Angeles after suffering a dislocated elbow and heading to injured reserve. The Bucs could also be without both Jamel Dean and Haason Reddick, so they're not just banged up on offense.\n        \n            \n                Week 12 NFL QB Power Rankings: Broncos' Bo Nix nears top 10; Browns' Shedeur Sanders debuts\n                \n                    Cody Benjamin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nRams vs. Bucs pick, prediction\nThe Buccaneers always seem to find a way to score -- even against the best defenses, of which the Rams are one. But their own defense is a significant pass funnel (i.e., it's easier to throw against them than it is to run), and that's dangerous against a team with Matthew Stafford playing at as high a level as he's hit in nearly every game this year. I think the Rams win this one, but the Bucs, as is their wont, either keep it close or find a way to backdoor cover. Prediction: Rams 31, Bucs 26\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Brandon Aiyuk hasn't suited up for the San Francisco 49ers in over a year, and his future with the franchise took a major turn recently.According to CBS Sports lead NFL insider Jonathan Jones, the 49ers voided Aiyuk's guaranteed money for the 2026 season during training camp, citing the wide receiver did not meet the requirements of his four-year, $120 million contract extension signed in August 2024.Saturday, coach Kyle Shanahan confirmed the team had voided the guarantees.\"It takes a lot of things to get a contract voided,\" Shanahan said. \"I've never dealt with that in my career and been in any building that's had that. It was unusual. But that's stuff that I can't get into right now.\"Aiyuk tore his ACL in Week 7 of last season. He has not been ruled out for this season, but the recent reports on his contractual changes certainly put his future in San Francisco in doubt.\nStill, Aiyuk is only 27 years old and just two years removed from a 1,342-yard, seven-touchdown 2023 season that earned him second-team All-Pro honors. As such, he'd be an intriguing -- and potentially quite popular -- free agent if he is indeed one in the 2026 offseason. Here are some potential suitors.\n        \n            \n                Shedeur Sanders becomes first Browns QB to win first career start since 1995\n                \n                    Jordan Dajani                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWashington CommandersThe Commanders are enduring a disappointing 2025 season after breaking through for an NFC Championship Game berth in 2024, but there are plenty of connections here. Aiyuk played his college football at Arizona State, where he was current Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels' teammate. In fact, last summer, Aiyuk and Daniels talked during Aiyuk's contract dispute. Furthermore, Washington GM Adam Peters used to be in San Francisco.The Commanders' lack of wide receiver depth has been on display this season as Terry McLaurin has dealt with a quad injury. Deebo Samuel -- a former 49er -- is in the final year of his deal. Washington is projected to have ample salary cap room and could look to add a wide receiver opposite McLaurin to bounce back in 2026.\nBuffalo BillsThe Bills have struggled to find a top wide receiver to pair with Josh Allen ever since they traded Stefon Diggs after the 2023 season. Last year's second-round pick, Keon Coleman, has been a healthy scratch each of the last two weeks, and in Week 12's loss to the Texans, no Buffalo wide receiver could do much downfield.The Bills are very much in their Super Bowl window, and Aiyuk could be a strong fit in what has been a major team need.Pittsburgh SteelersNo matter who is playing quarterback for Pittsburgh -- a seemingly annual question ever since Ben Roethlisberger departed -- wide receiver is a significant need. The Steelers traded for and extended DK Metcalf this offseason, but opposite him, it's been a mishmash of younger players who haven't delivered.\nThe Steelers were reportedly interested in acquiring Aiyuk during the 2024 offseason. Perhaps two offseasons later, they could make it work.Jacksonville JaguarsNew GM James Gladstone certainly hasn't been shy, and beyond Brian Thomas Jr. and Travis Hunter -- whose rookie season ended with a knee injury and whose position remains up in the air -- the rest of Jacksonville's wide receivers are scheduled to be free agents.Aiyuk and Thomas Jr. could form a promising outside wide receiver group, and given Gladstone's willingness to make bold moves to improve Trevor Lawrence's surroundings, Aiyuk could be a fit.\nThe non-playoff contendersSeveral teams who don't project to be playoff contenders in 2026 could also be suitors. That includes ...Titans -- It's been a rough debut year for Cameron Ward, but rookie wide receivers in Elic Ayomanor and Chimere Dike have flashed, and Aiyuk would be a big help.Raiders -- The Raiders are in for a lengthy rebuild and will be looking for a new quarterback. Coach Pete Carroll knows Aiyuk well from his time as Seahawks coach, and adding Aiyuk to Brock Bowers could jump-start the passing offense.Saints -- The Saints could be looking for a new quarterback, and adding Aiyuk to the mix would be a major help. Chris Olave is one of the league's most under-appreciated wide receivers, and pairing him with Aiyuk would create a strong ecosystem for any quarterback.\n            ",

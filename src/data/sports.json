    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL playoffs are here as six matchups are set to unfold over the course of Saturday, Sunday and Monday. The latest Wild Card Weekend NFL odds from DraftKings Sportsbook lists the Rams at -10.5 vs. the Panthers and the Bears at -1 vs. the Packers on Saturday. On Sunday, the latest NFL lines have the Bills at -1.5 vs. the Jaguars, the Eagles at -3.5 vs. the 49ers and the Patriots at -3.5 vs. the Chargers. A playoff edition of 'Monday Night Football' concludes the slate with the Texans favored by 3.5 points on the road against the Steelers.  SportsLine's Eric Cohen has revealed his exact score prediction for each game to help you formulate spread, over/under, money-line and even NFL best bets as Wild Card Weekend approaches.A SportsLine expert and CBS on-air talent, Cohen has evaluated the entire NFL playoff slate and delivers score predictions and logic for each matchup. Cohen went 180-91-1 (66%) on his NFL straight-up picks this season, and was a sizzling 10-3 (77%) on his straight-up NFL playoff picks last season. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now he's turned his attention to the 2026 NFL Wild Card Weekend, studied each matchup in depth, and has revealed his exact NFL score predictions for each game. All Week 18 NFL betting lines via DraftKings Sportsbook.Los Angeles Rams (-10.5) at Carolina Panthers\n\"Carolina won this matchup on November 30, 31-28, in one of the more impactful upsets for both teams in the NFL this season,\" Cohen said. \"That's not happening again. While Sean McVay's team hasn't looked great lately, they'll exact serious revenge as a double-digit road favorite on Saturday. The Panthers have absolutely no business being in the playoffs and it's going to be a wake up call to the other teams in the conference. I would be mildly surprised if this wasn't a blowout.\"Pick: Rams 34, Panthers 12Green Bay Packers at Chicago Bears (-1)\n\"This will be the NFC North rivals' third matchup since December 7,\" Cohen said. \"Green Bay held on by a touchdown in the first one, before blowing a 10 point lead in the final two minutes and falling in overtime. I believe that Packers coach Matt LaFleur's job is on the line. While his team makes the playoffs just about every season, they have lost four of their last five in the postseason and finished the 2025 regular season on a four game losing streak. I'm just not sure the Bears are ready for this kind of pressure, especially against a rested Green Bay team. In another thriller on Saturday night, the Packers exact a matter of revenge for the Week 16 collapse.\"Pick: Packers 23, Bears 21Buffalo Bills (-1.5) at Jacksonville Jaguars\n\"Winners of nine of their last 10 games, I have a hard time picking against Jacksonville at home,\" Cohen said. \"Buffalo's passing game is devoid of weapons and the Jaguars boast the NFL's top rush defense to slow Josh Allen and James Cook. While Allen and the Bills are 5-0 in the Wild Card Round since 2020, all five of those games have been at home. Trevor Lawrence has played at an MVP level since November and it will continue this weekend. The Jaguars win on a walk-off Cam Little field goal from 50-plus yards. If this result plays out as I anticipate, Sean McDermott won't be back to coach Buffalo next season.\"Pick: Jaguars 27, Bills 24San Francisco 49ers at Philadelphia Eagles (-3.5)\n\"With Philadelphia only giving 3.5 points on the early line, this is my favorite spread play of the Wild Card games,\" Cohen said. \"This is a matchup between the two NFC teams who have played in the last three Super Bowls, but I don't trust San Francisco's defense to hold up against the Eagles' potent receivers and Saquon Barkley on the ground. San Francisco had potentially three straight home games in front of them with a win against Seattle in Week 18. Now, after an offensive dud against the Seahawks, their season ends in disappointment in the City of Brotherly Love.\"Pick: Eagles 27, 49ers 21Los Angeles Chargers at New England Patriots (-3.5)\n\"My top play in this game is the Under 45.5 (though I may buy it up a few points in my weekend parlays),\" Cohen said. \"Both of these teams give up less than 21 points per game so don't expect fireworks. Of the Patriots' 14 wins, only three came against playoff teams (Panthers, Bills, Ravens) so they might have benefitted from a ridiculously weak schedule. Then again, the Chargers only beat two playoff teams (Broncos, Eagles), so I can't use that to their advantage. In their second playoffs under Jim Harbaugh (in two years), I think L.A. leads most of the game, with Drake Maye leading a late New England rally. \"Pick: Patriots 23, Chargers 21 Houston Texans (-3.5) at Pittsburgh Steelers \n\"I can't believe Aaron Rodgers found a way in the playoffs yet again,\" Cohen said. \"I have to think this is it for him either way. The Texans' defense should overwhelm the future Hall of Famer and hold Pittsburgh fairly in check. Entering the playoffs on a nine game winning streak and facing a team who I believe is a class below them, I think Houston's offense does enough to win. One betting note: Houston kicker Ka'imi Fairbairn had multiple field goal attempts in all 15 games he played in this season and hit his Over 1.5 made FGs in 14/15. Whatever the juice is, lay it in this game.\"Pick: Texans 23, Steelers 10How to get more NFL Wild Card Weekend picksSportsLine's model has simulated every Wild Card Weekend Game 10,000 times and revealed its picks.

    "body": "\n        FRISCO, Texas -- If there's one area to blame when it comes to the Dallas Cowboys' 7-9-1 2025 season that resulted in the team missing the playoffs for the second year in a row, it's the defense.Dallas' offense averaged 27.7 points per game, the seventh-best in the NFL, but the defense allowed 30.1 points per game, the most in the league and the second-most points per game allowed in the 66-season history of the Cowboys. Only Dallas' inaugural 1960 squad that finished 0-11-1 was a worse scoring defense than the 2025 unit, allowing 30.8 points per game. The lack of defensive production this season came in defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus' first season in this capacity for Dallas and All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons' first season away from the Cowboys. Owner/general manager Jerry Jones traded him away a week before the season began and didn't make any big moves to compensate for that loss until acquiring former All-Pro defensive tackle Quinnen Williams from the New York Jets at the NFL trade deadline during the Cowboys' Week 10 bye. Williams racked up 32 quarterback pressures from the time he made his Dallas debut in Week 11 through the end of the season, a figure that ranks as the 12th-most in the NFL in that span and the third-most among defensive tackles in that time. That's why he ended up being the Cowboys defense's sole Pro Bowl player in 2025. \nDespite ex-Cowboys Pro Bowl cornerback Trevon Diggs clashing about zone vs. man coverage usage all seasons before Dallas released him after Week 17, Williams vouched for the embattled Eberflus to return as defensive coordinator in 2026 as he took accountability for what went on in between the white lines this season. Eberflus himself took accountability for the defense's performance on Thursday, but he also said he wouldn't go back and do anything differently if he could. \"I love 'Flus man. I haven't really kind of been here [long enough] to know him from a personal standpoint, but the defensive scheme, the things that we did, I think was very, very good. Very smart,\" Williams said Monday at Cowboys locker room cleanout. \"I think us as players had a lot of hand in the pot to kind of execute and do the things that we can do. Because at the end of the day, around the NFL and around the world, Cover 3 is Cover 3. Man [coverage] is man [coverage]. Cover 2 is Cover 2. You got to win your one on ones in all aspects of the game. As players, you got to compete.\" The acquisitions of three-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kenny Clark in the Parsons trade, and Williams midseason boosted the Cowboys' run defense: Dallas was 29th in run defense in 2024 (137.1 rushing yards per game allowed) and 23rd in 2025 (125.5 rushing yards per game allowed). However, the Cowboys ranked as the NFL's worst passing defense, allowing 251.5 passing yards per game because of a lack of sack production without Parsons (35 in 2025, tied for the 11th-fewest in the league) and disarray in coverage in the secondary.   \nCowboys defense under Matt Eberflus in 2025, NFL ranksNFL rankPPG allowed30.1* LastTotal YPG allowed377.030thYards per play allowed6.131stPassing yards per game allowed251.5LastThird down conversion rate allowed 47.3%LastRed zone TD rate allowed 66.7%29thCompletion percentage allowed68.5%30thPass yards per attempt allowed8.131stPasser Rating109.631st* Second-most PPG allowed in a season in the Cowboys' 66-season historyThat's why Williams knows it's on the defense to make great strides this offseason. He forced a career-high three fumbles in 2025, but his sack total of 2.5 tied his career low from his rookie year in 2019. That's an area he knows he needs to improve upon going forward. Williams peaked in that category in 2022 with 12.0 sacks with the Jets. \"I know that we got to get better, especially having the offense that we have,\" Williams said. \"Whatever we got to do to get better, is going to happen. ... I just have to analyze, talk to the coaches and look at things, but I know first and foremost, to point the finger at myself, to try to get better. Especially with being able to be a game-changing tackle and get those big time sack-fumbles and affect the game at a higher level than I did this year. I think that's one step that is going to help us go in the right direction, so I'm super excited. ... I'm super excited for this coaching staff. ... Having 0 [linebacker DeMarvion Overshown] a fully healthy this offseason in his leadership. Having [defensive tackle] Osa [Odighizuwa] in his leadership. [Defensive tackle] Kenny [Clark] a full offseason in his leadership. Me in a full offseason in leadership. So we have the right guys in that unit to get things going in the right direction. No matter who Dallas' defensive coordinator is going forward, he would like to continue playing in an attack front scheme, a scheme that asks the defensive line to play up field and be the aggressors instead of just playing off of the offensive line's blocks. \"It's super important, no matter what scheme I'm in. I want to win,\" Williams said. ... \"What I'm asked to do, I'm willing to do if for the betterment of this team and the betterment of getting better as a defense.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Change is underway for the Cleveland Browns, who fired two-time Coach of the Year Kevin Stefanski at the end of a five-win 2025 season. Whether the coaching change leads to roster upheaval remains to be seen, and the uncertainty surrounding the Browns' direction casts a shadow over the starting quarterback job. Shedeur Sanders started the final seven games of the campaign, but general manager Andrew Berry did not commit to him as the leader of the offense for 2026.The Browns' revolving door at the quarterback position may continue just one year after they selected two signal-callers in the 2025 NFL Draft. Neither Sanders nor Dillon Gabriel strung together much success in their rookie seasons.\"We're going to do our work on the quarterback market,\" Berry said after the Stefanski ouster. \"It's too important of a position, and it's something that has to be solidified. I can't sit here and tell you whether the solution for the starter in 2026 is internal or external. It's something that we're going to work through over the next several weeks, and quite honestly, the new head coach will also have a lot of input on that, as well.\"Cleveland has a number of options even with Deshaun Watson sitting on the books as an expensive, untradeable asset. It could look to deal Gabriel or Sanders in a trade for a quarterback or draft capital, it may seek immediate help from a veteran free agent or it could use another draft pick -- potentially one of its two first-rounders -- on a promising rookie.\nIf the market is dry or the Browns' next coach sees enough potential in Sanders to give him another look in 2026, it is also possible that the former Colorado star will reprise his role atop the depth chart.\"I think I did what I was able to do,\" Sanders said. \"I definitely grew from a lot of things, and I got experience now. I'm always the same confidence-wise. I'm there. But that's not in my hands. That's not my decision. I can't speak on what other people feel.\"Sanders' flashes of excellence were bright during his rookie campaign. A 364-yard, three-touchdown effort against the Tennessee Titans in his third start displayed the kind of upside he could bring to an offense that has lacked direction for years. But he also threw more interceptions (10) than touchdowns (seven) on the year, took too many sacks and had the second-lowest QBR of any quarterback in the league with a minimum of six starts.\n\"I think we saw a lot of progress with Shedeur this year,\" Berry said. \"I think that's both mentally and physically, playing the position. He's still very much a work in progress like many rookie quarterbacks are. But I think we saw some really good things in terms of his playmaking, his accuracy, his ability to extend with his feet. I think I'd also give him credit -- as well as our offensive staff -- for bringing him along in terms of his pocket management, his situation awareness and things of that nature.\"\n            ",

The 2024 seventh-round pick suffered the injury in San Francisco's Week 18 loss to the Seattle Seahawks.Bethune had already been filling in for injured All-Pro Fred Warner, who suffered a broken and dislocated ankle in Week 6. The 49ers ruled it a season-ending injury for their standout linebacker, though Shanahan said Monday there's a chance Warner could return if the 49ers advance to the NFC Championship Game.\"I think it's too far off right now,\" Shanahan said Monday, via The Athletic. \"It is a possibility as we get closer to a possible third game here, a championship game. But it's not something we're thinking about right now.\"Bethune's ailment not the only linebacker injury. Dee Winters (ankle) and Luke Gifford (quadriceps) will be evaluated throughout the week ahead of the 49ers' wild card game against the Philadelphia Eagles after picking up injuries in the Seattle game, Shanahan said.The only other linebackers on San Francisco's current active roster are Curtis Robinson and Garret Wallow. Robinson has not played since Week 15; Wallow only joined the team less than a month ago, though he ended up seeing 40 defensive snaps against the Seahawks.\nThe 49ers also have Eric Kendricks, signed in late November, on the practice squad; the 11th-year veteran got his first start of the year in Week 18 and will likely play a big role again.\"I'm real confident in Eric,\" Shanahan said. \"He's been here long enough, he's gotten in in the last couple of weeks, and I'm glad we got him for this situation.\"The 49ers have been ravaged by injuries all year. Nick Bosa tore his ACL in Week 3, and first-round rookie Mykel Williams tore his ACL in Week 9. Offensively, Brock Purdy, George Kittle, Ricky Pearsall all missed time, and Trent Williams (hamstring) missed Week 18.\nSan Francisco is 4.5-point underdogs at Philadelphia according to DraftKings Sportsbook.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        If Philip Rivers returns to the NFL in 2026, he may do so as a coach rather than a player. The Indianapolis Colts quarterback, who came out of retirement last month to briefly fill in amid the team's litany of injuries, is reportedly drawing interest for a coaching role. And in response to the buzz about his potential candidacy during the 2026 offseason, Rivers said he feels as though he is capable of being an NFL coach.All of Rivers' experience on the sideline has been at the high school level. He has been the head coach at Fairhope (Ala.) St. Michael Catholic since 2021 and built his program into a power, going 12-2 in 2024 and 13-1 this season. The jump to the pro level is obviously a sizable one, but Rivers does not lack experience in NFL locker rooms as an 18-year veteran with a Hall of Fame caliber résumé.\"Those are all big 'what-ifs,'\" Rivers said of NFL coaching opportunities. \"I do think, as humbly as I can say it, that I can coach at this level. I know enough about the game and about the guys from a leadership standpoint, camaraderie, all that comes with it. That's not something that I'm sitting here pursuing.\"Several teams conducted research on Rivers as a coaching candidate last year, and a number of teams are reportedly doing the same early in the 2026 cycle. It is believed that Rivers could even secure at least one interview request. He, however, did not show much interest in the opportunity a year ago and again downplayed his desire to put on an NFL headset.\nOne day after the end of the regular season, there are six open jobs across the league. The Tennessee Titans and New York Giants fired their coaches during the campaign, the Atlanta Falcons made a move on Sunday and the trio of the Cleveland Browns, Las Vegas Raiders and Arizona Cardinals ousted their leaders on Monday.\"I think what I learned in the last four weeks is you take it one day at a time,\" Rivers said. \"It was a Sunday afternoon. I had no thought of being in Indianapolis the next day, and then 24 hours later I was here. I've been here a month exactly, or four weeks exactly, today. Just take it one day at a time, be where you are and go from there.\"\nRivers arguably exceeded expectations during his three-game run as the Colts' starter. The 44-year-old lost all three of his starts, but he was a capable passer who totaled 544 yards and four touchdowns with three interceptions. If he is indeed done playing for good, he will close his career at No. 9 on the NFL's all-time passing leaderboard with 63,984 yards and No. 6 in passing touchdowns at 425.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The Miami Dolphins sparked uncertainty with their quarterback situation when they benched Tua Tagovailoa for Quinn Ewers for the final three weeks of the 2025 NFL season. With his future in question, Tagovailoa said at the end of the year that he would welcome a fresh start with a new team.Reporters approached Tagovailoa at his locker Monday, and the veteran quarterback said that he \"would be good with\" a new opportunity elsewhere. The reporters made sure that he understood the question was about a fresh start with a team other than the Dolphins, according to the Miami Herald,. Tagovailoa said he understood but declined to comment further.\"That would be dope,\" Tagovailoa said of the potential to start 2026 anew.Tagovailoa ceded the starting job in Week 16 after he set a new career highs in interceptions (15) and sacks (30) and posted the lowest QBR of his six-year run in Miami. Although he helped spark a late-season turnaround in which the Dolphins won four consecutive games, he went just 6-8 as the starter and turned in his first losing record.\nThe low points for Tagovailoa were abnormally dramatic. His season reached an impasse in October when he threw three interceptions in a loss to the Los Angeles Chargers and tossed three more the following week in a 31-6 drubbing at the hands of the Cleveland Browns.Miami has seen Tagovailoa at his best, though, and could reinsert him into the lineup in 2026 if it feels he is capable of returning to elite form. The former No. 5 overall pick led the NFL in completion percentage in 2024 and was the league's passing leader in 2023. He also paced the NFL in yards per attempt in 2022. All of that is to say Tagovailoa is not far removed from performing like one of the top quarterbacks in the league.Moving on from Tagovailoa entirely would come with its challenges. The Dolphins inked their franchise quarterback to a four-year, $212.4 million contract extension in July 2024 and guaranteed him $167 million. He is under contract through 2028 and carries a $56.4 million cap hit in 2026. Releasing Tagovailoa is likely off the table, so the Dolphins would need to find a trade partner willing to take on his sizable salary.\nThis could be a pivotal offseason for the Dolphins, who are already expected to move on from wide receiver Tyreek Hill after he sustained a serious knee injury early 2025. Parting ways with both Hill and Tagovailoa would end an era that featured some of the most prolific passing offenses in the NFL over the last handful of years.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The NFL playoffs are here, and I love doing playoff challenge leagues. Why stop setting Fantasy lineups if we don't have to just yet?Now, there are many different forms of playoff challenge leagues, so knowing your rules are important. There are total points leagues throughout the postseason, leagues where you can only use someone once in each round and Guillotine leagues, among others.The best way to approach any playoff challenge league is to map out the NFL postseason. Decide on what teams you think will advance to Super Bowl LX, and build out playoff scenarios from there. And this year the playoffs feel wide open, which makes it tough.For example, here is my playoff picture. In the AFC, I expect the Patriots, Bills and Texans to advance past the wild-card round. I have Buffalo beating Denver and New England winning against Houston, and then I have the Bills advancing to the Super Bowl with a win over the Patriots in the AFC Championship Game.I know that seems crazy with how poorly Buffalo has looked at times this season. And the Bills don't have an easy path to the Super Bowl, starting with the opening game against the Jaguars. But I'm backing Josh Allen and James Cook to help Buffalo represent the AFC in San Francisco this season.In the NFC, I have the Eagles, Packers and Rams winning in the wild-card round. Seattle will then beat Green Bay, and the Rams will upset Philadelphia. The Rams then beat the Seahawks in the NFC Championship Game to advance to the Super Bowl.While the Rams have struggled to close the season, I'm still a believer in Matthew Stafford and Sean McVay, especially with Davante Adams (hamstring) back for the postseason. It won't be an easy path for the Rams, especially if they have to play Philadelphia and Seattle on the road, but I still like Los Angeles as the best team in the NFC.My playoff-challenge rankings are reflected in those predictions. Again, I encourage you to build your own path to the Super Bowl -- and check your league settings. But this is how I expect the playoffs to go and which players will be around the longest in the upcoming NFL postseason.These playoff rankings will be updated each week until Super Bowl LX.

    "body": "\n        There is no organization in the NBA that operates with less transparency from the top than the New York Knicks. Team president Leon Rose doesn't speak at press conferences or answer questions from the external media, and owner James Dolan hadn't done an interview in three years. But all that changed on Monday when Dolan joined his friend Craig Carton on New York's WFAN radio for the launch of \"The Carton Show,\" offering a rare chance to hear about the Knicks from their owner. There were a handful of topics discussed, including whether Rose has a long-term contract with the team -- \"As far as I know, Leon's with us for the long-term\" -- and why Dolan refused to hang a banner for the Knicks winning the NBA Cup -- \"We want an NBA championship. We don't want the consolation prize.\" However there were two topics that came up that were the most interesting to get Dolan's thoughts on: the firing Tom Thibodeau, the first coach to get the Knicks back to the Eastern Conference finals in 25 years, and subsequent hiring of Mike Brown and the rumors of trade talks to bring in Milwaukee Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo. \nDolan on firing Tom Thibodeau\"The team is really built on the shoulders of Tom Thibodeau. He built that core, we went as far as we did last year, so you really gotta take your hat off to Tom and the job that he did. But we did come to the conclusion that we had an idea of how we wanted to organize the team, and actually it goes for both teams [Knicks and Rangers], and that meant we needed to evolve beyond the old traditional coaching formulas, etc. And we tried to work that with Tom and it really wasn't his thing ...\"That's some of it [not using the bench, style of play], but it was much more about style of leadership. Collaboration versus sort of [lone wolf] -- yeah. Because of the way, particularly basketball, is evolving, how much more complicated it is, they're very big on development on both clubs, because you can't -- it's not like the old days, the old Yankees where you get Reggie Jackson and this guy and you put together a team. It's almost impossible to do that in the NBA. You have to home grow some of your talent and that also builds up trade currency, etc. But it's a development thing, and that's a team. It's literally 20 people who are specifically dedicated to developing the players, to getting their skill levels up to getting the strategy on the court in[to games]. And that's important for the development of the franchise. But Tom, he liked development, but he didn't really ... [interrupted by Carton] ...\"I won't say you can't win a title with Tom Thibodeau, I don't think that's true, but if you want to build a long-term, competitive, compete for the … you need somebody who's more of a collaborator than Tom was. But still, you really, Tom is still a great coach. He should coach again in the NBA. If I had a franchise I was just starting with, he would be a gold mine to get. He was like that for us when we first started and he first came in. He brought discipline. He brought strategy. He brought us all that way, but we really felt we needed to make a change to go the rest of the way ...\n\"We talked to Tom all the time, and, look, I don't wanna get too deep into the interaction, but I would say that whole last year we were talking with Tom about where we wanted to go, etc. He would probably tell you that he's stubborn, but he'd also tell you that he's right.\"Dolan on whether Knicks came close to trading for Giannis Antetokounmpo\"Not that I'm aware of. And I think -- look, we love our team right now. They have chemistry, they all like each other. I've never seen a locker room more copacetic. There's a lot of energy in there. Leon can always overrule me, but I don't see us making a big change. We gotta keep building up this group. This group can win a championship. I believe that. \"Look how far we got with our group last year. And then take a look at who was playing and who wasn't playing, and we had injuries. We're going into this season, the second half of the season -- Josh [Hart] is still out and Landry [Shamet] is coming back soon -- we got depth. And if we stay healthy, we'll go into the playoffs in much better condition than we went into the playoffs last year.\"\nMain takeawaysDolan might not always like league rules, but even he knows better than to risk a tampering violation regarding Antetokounmpo, so it's not a surprise that he'd sidestep that topic. That said, he genuinely seems excited about this group and I'm inclined to believe him when he says there aren't plans for any major moves midseason and that they'll see what this group, as constructed, can do. That won't stop Antetokounmpo trade rumors, but it should put them on the back burner for six months. The Thibodeau portion was the most forthcoming part of Dolan's interview and he came across as someone a bit torn by parting ways with the coach who laid the foundation for this team's success. The word he kept coming back to was \"collaborator,\" and while he tried to be careful with his words, it was clear that at some point there was a split internally on how the team should operate to create sustained success and Thibodeau wasn't interested in making the changes the front office wanted. Dolan highlighted the importance of developing talent internally for both on-court reasons and creating more desirable trade assets, and it seems some of the frustration Knicks fans had with Thibodeau's tight rotations that resulted in minimal minutes for younger players was shared by those in charge. Dolan pointed to the depth of the Knicks this year and hoped they would enter the two-month gauntlet of an NBA Finals run better rested, and that starts with the reserves doing more to spell core players. \nThere wasn't as much ground-breaking news in the interview, but the Thibodeau portion was interesting and he at least briefly calmed the Antetokounmpo rumblings. His stance on an NBA Cup banner was perhaps the most controversial for Knicks fans, but also not at all surprising. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The end of the regular season doesn't just close the book on another year in the NFL. For some franchises, it also coincides with a reevaluation of the entire organization, which can result in various firings. While some clubs made changes midseason, the more common time we see head coaches and GMs be let go comes the day after the regular season concludes, better known as Black Monday. Already, we've seen four teams fire their now-former head coach (Falcons, Browns, Cardinals and Raiders) and one club also rid itself of its general manager (Falcons). Pair that with the two head coaching vacancies (Giants and Titans) that were already open due to firings during the season, and quite a few jobs are opening up across the league. So, who fills them? With the Band-Aid ripped off, those teams are now beginning the process of finding their next leader. Below, we'll chronicle that pursuit by tracking the latest interview requests by each team. Follow live updates on NFL coaching and GM changes, firings and rumors.Head coaches\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Arizona CardinalsPrevious head coach: Jonathan GannonAfter three seasons on the job, the Cardinals decided to move on from Jonathan Gannon. He went 15-36 as the organization's head coach, which included a 3-14 season in 2025. Arizona ended the year on a nine-game losing streak. The Cardinals have made the playoffs once in the last 10 seasons. \nInterview requestsTo be announced.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Atlanta FalconsPrevious head coach: Raheem MorrisAfter two seasons on the job, the Falcons fired Morris in the aftermath of a disappointing 2025 campaign. Atlanta finished 8-9 for the second season in a row and was third in the NFC South. Interview requestsKlint Kubiak, Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator (via NFL Media)Anthony Weaver, Miami Dolphins defensive coordinator (via NFL Media)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Cleveland BrownsPrevious head coach: Kevin StefanskiCleveland moved on from Kevin Stefanski after a 5-12 season in 2025 that saw the franchise finish last in the AFC North. Stefanski coached the Browns for the last six seasons and won two Coach of the Year awards, but was 45-56 in his 101 regular-season games.  Interview requestsTo be announced.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Las Vegas RaidersPrevious head coach: Pete CarrollPete Carroll proved to be one-and-done in Las Vegas after the 74-year-old was unable to lift the organization to respectability in 2025. The Raiders finished with the worst record in the NFL (3-14) and now possess the No. 1 overall pick at the 2026 NFL Draft. General manager John Spytek and minority owner Tom Brady are expected to spearhead the coaching search. \nInterview requestsTo be announced.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New York GiantsPrevious head coach: Brian DabollNew York fired Daboll midway through the 2025 season after a 2-8 start to the year. He'd been at his post since 2022 and went 20-40-1 over his tenure in the regular season. General manager Joe Schoen will remain with the organization and lead the search. Interview requestsMike Kafka -- Giants interim head coach and offensive coordinator\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Tennessee TitansPrevious head coach: Brian CallahanTennessee fired Callahan in mid-October after a 1-5 start to the season. The 41-year-old coach was hired in 2024 and went 4-19 over his tenure. Interview requestsMatt Nagy -- Chiefs offensive coordinator (via The Athletic)Vance Joseph -- Broncos defensive coordinator (via CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones)Steve Spagnuolo -- Chiefs defensive coordinator (via The Athletic)Lou Anarumo -- Colts defensive coordinator (via The Athletic)Raheem Morris, former Atlanta Falcons head coach (ESPN)General managers\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Atlanta FalconsPrevious GM: Terry FontenotAtlanta cleaned house after the 2025 season, not only firing Raheem Morris but also parting ways with general manager Terry Fontenot. He had been with the organization in this GM role since 2021 and was able to add some intriguing skill position players like Bijan Robinson and Drake London, but was unable to get a concrete plan in place at quarterback. A clear plan at that position will likely be the main emphasis for owner Arthur Blank as he combs through candidates this time around. \nInterview requestsTo be announced.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Miami DolphinsPrevious GM: Chris GrierIt was a rather seismic decision by the Dolphins and Grier to mutually part ways during the 2025 season, simply due to how long his tenure had been with the organization. He started as a scout in 2000 and stayed with the franchise ever since, ascending to GM in 2016. Miami made the playoffs just three times over his 10-year stint as GM, and has been under .500 in each of the last two seasons, due to an inability to build a stable roster. Interview requestsJon-Eric Sullivan -- Packers VP of player personnel (via NFL Media)Alec Halaby -- Eagles assistant general manager (via NFL Media)Tariq Ahmad -- 49ers VP of player personnel (via NFL Media)Josh Williams -- 49ers director of scouting and football operations (via NFL Media)John McKay -- Rams assistant general manager (via NFL Media)RJ Gillen -- 49ers assistant general manager (via NFL Media)\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Michigan quarterback Bryce Underwood will return for his sophomore season, he announced, giving first-year Wolverines coach Kyle Whittingham a cornerstone around which to build his debut roster.Retaining Underwood was priority No. 1 for Whittingham upon his arrival at Michigan. The firing of Sherrone Moore and staff turnover that occurred in the wake of the stunning ouster cast uncertainty over the prized former five-star recruit's future. That Whittingham was able to keep Underwood in Ann Arbor is a major early victory for the veteran coach and could help him hit the ground running with a competitive first year in the Big Ten.Teams in search of quarterback help would have knocked down the doors to land Underwood had he entered the transfer portal, but his contract with Michigan may have factored in his decision to stay. Underwood signed a multi-year deal out of high school that, per CBS Sports' Chris Hummer, pays him more than $2 million per season. His deal also comes with a significant buyout that would have made a transfer more challenging.While Underwood's freshman season came with a number of hiccups, including his three-interception day in the Citrus Bowl loss to Texas last week, the Michigan quarterback also dazzled at times and displayed immense upside as a potential star in the making. He led the Wolverines to a 9-3 regular-season record, passed for 2,428 yards and ran for six touchdowns with a display of dual-threat talent.\nWhittingham constructed an identity at Utah that revolved mostly around defense, but the staff he brings with him to Michigan has the potential to turn Underwood into a stellar playmaker. Offensive coordinator Jason Beck is a bright mind who produced statistical anomalies from his past quarterbacks and most recently developed Devon Dampier into a dual-threat standout. His track record suggests he can turn Underwood into a refined passer while utilizing his legs to construct a dynamic, yardage-eating attack.If Underwood takes his expected step forward as a sophomore, the Michigan offense in total should benefit and improve upon its mediocre 2025 production. The Wolverines were just the 69th-highest-scoring team in the country and ranked No. 107 in passing offense during his debut season.\nDespite all of the upheaval inside the Michigan program, retaining Underwood gives Michigan a bright outlook for 2026 and beyond. With three years of eligibility remaining, the former No. 1 overall recruit has ample time to reach his ceiling. If he taps into that potential this season, the Wolverines could contend for a College Football Playoff berth in Year 1 of the Whittingham era. After all, they were effectively one win shy of earning a spot in the bracket in 2025.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\nWe talked about how the market was treating teams potentially resting players last week in five games and went 4-1 on those picks, and now we turn from the games that mean little to the games that mean everything. The playoffs start Saturday with the Rams heading to Carolina to face a Panthers team that is expected to be a double-digit underdog in the matchup, a monster spread and one that has been impossible to cover in the past.Think that's an exaggeration? Home underdogs of four points or more in playoff games are 9-0 ATS over the last 50 years and while the previous three all covered in a losing effort, the previous six all won outright. If you look at games where a team is catching more than seven points, then we have three previous examples, all coming in the last 15 years.The most recent underdog of at least four points came during the 2020 playoffs when Tom Brady went to Washington to face a 7-9 team led by Taylor Heinicke as 10-point favorites. A field goal late in the first half got the Bucs just outside the number with an 18-7 halftime lead and then they did it again by extending their lead to 28-16 in the fourth quarter, but Washington scored a late TD and a 31-23 final left them with the cover.Skipping two 4.5-point underdogs that covered, our second huge home dog came in the 2011 playoffs when Mike Tomlin took the best defense in the league into Denver to face a questionable Broncos offense led by Tim Tebow, which caused the home team to be catching 7.5 points. The Broncos led from the second quarter until late in the fourth when the Steelers tied the game, then an 80-yard TD to Demaryius Thomas gave Denver the outright win.The year prior, the Saints marched into Seattle as 10-point favorites against a 7-9 Seahawks team that like the Broncos had been unimpressive on both sides of the ball entering the postseason. The Saints managed a 10-point lead early before the Seahawks stormed back and led the final 31 minutes of the game, emphasizing their victory with the unforgettable Beast Quake touchdown by Marshawn Lynch late in the 41-36 win.\nSo what's the takeaway? To me, it is incredibly hard for any team to walk into an opposing stadium as no-doubt winners and put together a performance to meet expectations, as you have to play a near-perfect game to cover such a big number on the road against a team -- even a mediocre team -- that was able to win its division. The 2020 Bucs went on to win the Super Bowl in dominant fashion against the Chiefs but when they failed to cover in the wild card round, they had four drives stall in the red zone and result in field goals and lost a fumble on another drive that was near field goal range.The Rams are similar to that Bucs team with an elite QB late in his career paired with some great weapons and facing a team with a subpar offense that won a bad division, although that Washington team had a better defense than Carolina. My power ratings say this spread should be Rams -7, and I would certainly expect a result around that number more than I would covering as double-digit road favorites considering the history of those teams in the playoffs.I'll have my spread picks this week at SportsLine, where members are able to get access to all my picks throughout the week as they're made and hopefully take advantage of some good line value.Let's dive into our betting power ratings and then take a look at what the spread should be for every other game during Super Wild Card Weekend.Wild card round power ratingsTeamWC18171615LAR7.57.57.587SEA77766.5JAC5.55532PHI5.54.54.532NE55544DEN5444.52.5BUF5454.54.5LAC3.52.541.51HOU33.53.53.53SF2.54.54.532GB2.501.535CHI1.53.52.51.51PIT1.5-1.51.510CAR-1.5-1.5-1-2.5-2I have given a bump to the Eagles, Bills, Chargers and Packers with those four teams getting key players rest in Week 18 as that really seems to matter more often than not, especially for teams as beat up as those four rosters. The Rams and Seahawks stay in their own tier despite not resting players and while the gap is notable between them and the next tier, it's no so big that I think rematch -- potentially in the NFC Championship if the 49ers or Packers win this week -- is inevitable.I feel like the Jaguars are the best team in the AFC right now but aren't being treated as such by the market, and I'm surprised they're underdogs to the Bills. I'm putting the Eagles alongside Jacksonville with the expectation the offense will be better with Lane Johnson expected to return this week. They don't have the offense of the Rams or the defense of the Seahawks, but they are probably better balanced than either so even at 5.5, I might have them a little low.Three AFC teams sit as five points better than average, but I think two could be a point high, if not more. I gave the Bills credit for the rest and hopefully they'll be in as good shape for their game against Jacksonville as they've been in months from a health perspective, but that remains to be seen. The Patriots have not faced many tough offenses this year, splitting their games with a beat-up Bills squad while edging out a Bucs team at the beginning of its downturn and a Ravens team that lost Lamar Jackson midgame. Both of those teams didn't make the playoffs, so the only playoff teams New England has faced are the Bills, Steelers and Panthers.The Chargers are going to be at the mercy of matchups moving forward with their patchwork offensive line, but Justin Herbert has overcome those limitations in the past and the defense is in top form, so I'm not ruling out Jim Harbaugh's team from making some noise in the postseason. I give them a slight edge over a less-proven Houston offense.I have the 49ers and Packers side by side as I don't know what we're going to get from either, but I'm almost certain it'll be tied to player availability. San Francisco absolutely needs Trent Williams back against that Philadelphia front and comments from the weekend make it sound like he would've had a chance to play if the Week 18 game fell on Sunday, so I'd give him better than even odds to be back for the matchup. The Packers defense might be a major problem with the injuries it has sustained, so we'll see if Jordan Love and the offensive unit can catch fire and that possibility has me profiling those two NFC wild card teams similarly.I'm not putting much confidence in a Bears team that beat expectations to win the division but looked mediocre for much of the regular season finale against the Lions at home. Chicago certainly has the feel of a one-and-done team who might be in for bigger things next season. I'm giving the Steelers a boost with T.J. Watt back and DK Metcalf returning for the wild-card round, and I feel like the easy out is to just keep underestimating them because the talent on paper might not be on par with many of the other playoff teams.The Panthers, even as a below-average overall team, have a fighter's chance at beating a team they've already beat once at home, and we talked about the history of big road favorites above. Now, let's get into the other matchups.Packers at Bears\nThis game is functionally a pick 'em with the Bears only favored on the money line by a few cents. My ratings give the Bears a slightly better chance to win as they would project a spread of Bears -1.5, and that's acknowledging Chicago has had one of the better home field advantages in the league recently. The Bears were 5-3 ATS at home this year but missed a cover in the win over the Giants by a half-point, and their other two ATS losses were close games against the Vikings to open the season and the Lions to close it.I also think there's a bit of wiggle room to reduce the Packers' rating downward as my current number projects good health for the offense coming off the rest week. The defense lost one of the best edge rushers in the league in Micah Parsons, and the Devonte Wyatt injury leaves them a mess on the interior. Nate Hobbs went on IR late in the year and Trevon Diggs is trying to replace him on the fly. The defense may have avoided another disaster after Jevon Holland left the Week 18 game with a knee injury, but that's another issue a player has to play through. That's before we get to an offense that's lost Elgton Jenkins at center and is now hoping Zach Tom returns and is able to play up to his typical high level at right tackle, with key target Tucker Kraft also out and Josh Jacobs playing through injury much of the year.We've seen plenty of upstarts with young quarterbacks like the Packers, Texans and Jaguars win a playoff game in their first trip to the postseason with that guy under center, so I'm not counting the Bears out just because they're upstarts. But it's going to take more consistency on both sides of the ball to get it done.Bills at Jaguars\nThe market has made the Bills the favorite in this game, saying that Josh Allen is enough to overcome home field advantage and overall team strength. My ratings of course disagree, as I have the Jaguars as the better team on a neutral field and project them as a 2.5-point favorite in this game. That's even with giving the Bills a bump for resting players in Week 18.The Bills have been mostly successful in games where they can run the ball, like the blowout win over the Jets with their starters resting, and not as successful in games where they can't run the ball, as happened in the loss to the Eagles the previous week. Allen has not been able to rely on his passing-game weapons as much, and his 25 passing touchdowns are the fewest since his first full season as starter. He's also been sacked more than ever, 40 times in all and on 8% of dropbacks where he didn't run for positive yards, which is well above its highest point since 2019. The defense has been its own issue, particularly defending the run, with six opponents rushing for at least 189 yards as the Bills finished 30th in yards per rush allowed. I already think I'm being aggressively positive with their rating, so that suggests the market hasn't bought into Jacksonville at all.The Jaguars are a team that plays sound run defense with a quarterback that was playing like a darkhorse MVP candidate down the stretch, potentially shortening the gap between him and Allen. If he falls apart in this spot and Allen doesn't, then the Bills can certainly win this game. Take away the QBs and I see a much stronger roster on both sides of the ball from the home team.49ers at Eagles\nThis line has seen some early movement to the Eagles, and I think that's right. My ratings give them a boost for the rest edge after last week and are counting on them to wipe away their inconsistency on offense from the regular season, and I have them as three points better than the 49ers, who like the Patriots played a relatively easy schedule this year, on a neutral field. In Philadelphia, my spread projection is Eagles -5.5.An offensive lineman is never going to win MVP, but two tackles in this game certainly have a case to do so. The Eagles' season turned negative as usual after the Lane Johnson injury as they lost their next three games, beat two pushovers and then edged out the Bills in a bad game for the offense considering the opponent. The 49ers offense in the biggest spot of the year was non-functional without Trent Williams on the field in Week 18. It appears both guys are trending toward playing in this matchup, which is good news for getting the best possible version of these teams and especially for avoiding the worst. While the 49ers defense did their part in that game last week, they still have the potential to be the team's fatal flaw with how they played down the stretch.For that to happen, the Eagles offense will need to finally pull it all together and start to look like the attack that ran through the playoffs last year before obliterating the Chiefs in the Super Bowl. They ranked just 19th in scoring offense and an unbelievable 23rd in yards per rush considering how unstoppable the ground game was last season. A healthy offensive line could help them get closer to that level than they've been for much of the season.Chargers at Patriots\nIf I had to pick a game where the spread is probably right, it would be Packers-Bears. But this would be a close second. I think I'm pretty aggressive with my rating for both teams, and my spread projection for this matchup is Patriots -4.I probably have the Chargers rated higher than most at 3.5 points better than average, which is in part due to them getting to rest last week. But I also think the team isn't getting enough credit for a defense that has held nine of its last 10 opponents to 20 points or fewer. That run includes four playoff teams, stopping a Broncos team fighting for the No. 1 seed from scoring an offensive touchdown while recovering from two early touchdowns allowed to Houston the previous week to keep the team in the game. They also generated five turnovers in an overtime win over the Eagles and three in a dominant victory against Pittsburgh. Their one bad performance in this stretch came against the Jaguars, who might be the hottest team in football.There are plenty of Patriots naysayers due to their easy schedule but you can only beat who you play, and they have top-four scoring offenses and defenses on the season. The question is whether they have the edge rushers to take advantage of the Chargers' weakness at tackle, because if they don't and Justin Herbert can lead the team to 20 points, it might be enough to score the upset with how well the Chargers defense is playing.Texans at Steelers\nThis game may keep bouncing between 3 and 3.5 as the market looks to buy in to the Texans and fade the Steelers, but maybe it shouldn't. Home underdogs between 3-4 points are 5-2 ATS in the last 10 years, and going back to our initial look at the Rams-Panthers game, all home 'dogs of three points or more are 10-3-1 ATS since the 2011 playoffs and 18-9-1 ATS since 1981. I'm trying not to underrate the Steelers, and with their excellent home-field advantage my spread projection for this game is Pittsburgh -1.For how the Steelers offense is judged based on the personnel on paper, they've scored 25+ points in nine of their last 12 games, only getting shut down by the Browns and Chargers on the road and a Bills team that ran all over them. The Texans defense is second to none so it's possible we see a similar Pittsburgh offensive outing to what we saw in those Browns and Chargers games, but they also scored 23-25 points in three straight home games earlier in the year against the Vikings, Browns and Packers. The Texans also just gave up 30 points against Riley Leonard despite getting three takeaways, so they're not exactly in their best form.The Texans offense has put up a bunch of points against some awful defenses, but I still can't trust them in a tough matchup after what they showed against the Raiders a few weeks ago. This Pittsburgh defense just got back T.J. Watt as well, giving them a strong group of edge rushers that can overwhelm Houston's subpar O-line and make life difficult for C.J. Stroud, who hit two long TDs early against the Chargers but had just 126 yards on his other 26 attempts. It's a game where I don't think I'd be surprised by any final score.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Calls for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to make a coaching change were amplified when the team squandered a clear path to the playoffs and finished the 2025 season with seven losses in nine games. With the campaign now complete, coach Todd Bowles said he has not yet met with team ownership and made a public case as to why he should retain his job.Four teams canned their coaches in the first 24 hours following the end of the regular season. Bowles said his track record speaks for itself as to why he should not join that group.\"All I can do is coach and be myself,\" Bowles said on Monday. \"I've earned the chance. I've won three straight division titles, so that says a lot, as far as I'm concerned. But I don't really have a message for fans other than true fans are true fans. We're going to try and do our best to go out there and win for them. They're going to feel how they feel. That's not the coach's problem. The coach's problem is to make the team better. That's all I'm looking forward to.\"The second half of the season eliminated some of the goodwill Bowles built with the Buccaneers fanbase throughout the prolific three-year run to start his tenure. Tampa Bay opened at 6-2 but finished the campaign below .500 after rattling off two separate losing streaks of at least three games. It won just twice since October.According to CBS Sports' NFL insider Jonathan Jones, the losing season is unlikely to spell the end of the Bowles era in Tampa. The Buccaneers awarded Bowles a three-year contract extension last offseason. Changes to the assistant coaching staff, however, could be in store for a franchise that seeks to get back to the postseason as quickly as next year.\n\"I understand their frustrations, and I understand our own frustrations, as well,\" Bowles said. \"It's well warranted and well warranted within the building, as well.\"Reasons for optimism as Bowles enters Year 5Barring an ouster in the coming days, Bowles will gear up for his fifth year at the helm in search of a bounce-back run to the NFC South title. The division's shortcomings should be a source of optimism for Buccaneers fans, who just watched their team rattle off three consecutive NFC South titles. The Carolina Panthers won the division this season with a losing record, and neither them nor the Atlanta Falcons or New Orleans Saints project as powerhouses in the immediate future.Bowles has taken Tampa Bay to the playoffs more often than not, and with his current roster construction, he should be squarely in the mix to do so again in 2026.\nThe offense has all of the tools it needs to run the division with a young and talented supporting cast around Baker Mayfield. Wide receivers Emeka Egbuka, Tez Johnson and Jalen McMillan give the Buccaneers a youthful trio, and if Mike Evans re-signs and Chris Godwin stays healthy next year, they should round out one of the NFL's top receiving units. Standout running back Bucky Irving will also be back.\n            ",

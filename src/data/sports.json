    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The Los Angeles Chargers have one of the most iconic uniforms in the NFL, and this week, they'll be adding a new look to their wardrobe collection. For the first time in franchise history, the Chargers are going to wear a gold jersey. The team will unveil an all-gold look Sunday when they host the Indianapolis Colts at 4:05 p.m. ET on CBS (stream on Paramount+).The Chargers unveiled two new alternate uniforms over the summer. The first one was a navy throwback jersey that they'll wear in Week 8 against the Minnesota Vikings, but the one that drew all the headlines was the gold one they'll be wearing against the Colts. \nAlthough this is the first time the Chargers have ever worn a gold jersey, you might have actually seen a fan wearing one, and that's because gold jerseys were available for sale back in 2020. Fans embraced the look back then, and that's a big reason why the team decided to add it this year. \"Nike had previously done a retail version of the 2020 jerseys in gold,\" Chargers President of Business Operations A.G. Spanos said. \"It sold quite well and had really good word of mouth. In fact, in my own household, it was my kids' favorite uniform. It definitely appeals to the younger demographic. Ultimately, it captured a lot of things we were looking to accomplish with an alternate uniform. It was a nod to the past but still had a youthful energy.\"\nThe Chargers also added Powder Blue pants to go along with their famous Powder Blue uniforms, and they wore their all-Powder Blue look for the first time in Week 5. \nThe Chargers now have a total of eight uniform combinations available this year. \nWith the all-gold uniform debuting this week, it could instantly become the Chargers' most popular uniform combination if L.A. can beat the Colts. With the Chargers sitting at 4-2 and the Colts at 5-1, this is a huge showdown that could have a dramatic impact on how the AFC playoff race shakes out. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The two Championship Series could not be more different. The reigning World Series champion Dodgers have stifled the MLB-best Brewers in the NLCS, holding them to three runs in three games en route to a 3-0 series lead. In the ALCS, the Blue Jays and Mariners have traded body blows, with the road team winning all four games. That's a 2-2 series. The ALCS is now a best-of-three series while the Dodgers have four chances to win one game to become the first reigning champ since the 2009 Phillies to return to the World Series. With that in mind, let's take stock of the Championship Series MVP races. This is an actual award, unlike our hypothetical Wild Card Series MVPs and Division Series MVPs. With the caveat that neither series is over and a lot can change (especially in the ALCS), here are the leading candidates for the two LCS MVP awards. NLCS: Brewers vs. Dodgers (Dodgers lead 3-0) 1. Yoshinobu Yamamoto, DodgersA wise man predicted there would be a complete game this postseason and Yamamoto obliged in Game 2. He threw 111 pitches in the three-hit masterpiece. Jackson Chourio hit Yamamoto's very first pitch out of the ballpark for a 1-0 lead, and the Brewers did not have another runner advance as far as second base the rest of the game. Yamamoto retired the final 14 batters he faced and only two of those 14 batters hit the ball out of the infield. It was the first complete game in the postseason since Justin Verlander in Game 2 of the 2017 ALCS. I suspect this era's rarity of complete games makes Yamamoto the NLCS favorite at the moment.2. Blake Snell, DodgersPerhaps this qualifies as a hot take, but I think Snell's Game 1 performance was more impressive than Yamamoto's Game 2 effort. Snell struck out 10 Brewers in eight shutout innings and allowed just one baserunner (a single) who was erased on a pickoff, so he faced the minimum 24 batters in those eight innings. Also, the game was scoreless after five innings and the Dodgers had a tiny 1-0 lead through eight innings. Snell had less margin of error than Yamamoto, who was given a multi-run lead in the sixth and had a four-run lead in the ninth. Great games, both of them. Yamamoto pitching the ninth leads me to believe he's the NLCS MVP favorite over Snell.\n3. Freddie Freeman, DodgersLast year's World Series MVP is 3 for 12 (.250) with two doubles and a home run in the NLCS, and the home run was a sixth inning go-ahead shot to give Los Angeles a 1-0 lead in what became a 2-1 win in Game 1. Tommy Edman, last year's NLCS MVP, is 4 for 11 (.364) with a double and 2 RBI in the NLCS. Mookie Betts is currently the only other Dodger with multiple RBI, and he is 1 for 11 (.091) in the three games. Right now, it feels like there's a pretty big gap between Nos. 1 and 2, and No. 3 in the NLCS MVP race.ALCS: Blue Jays vs Mariners (series tied 2-2) 1. Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Blue JaysAfter going 0 for 7 in Games 1 and 2, Vlad Jr. erupted in Games 3 and 4, going 6 for 9 with two doubles, two homers and two walks in the two wins. He leads all players in hits (15), homers (five), and RBI (11) this postseason even though Toronto had a Wild Card Series bye. This is only an ALCS MVP, not a full postseason MVP, but Guerrero has still done enough to be considered the favorite to take home ALCS MVP, assuming the Blue Jays win the series.2. Jorge Polanco, MarinersPolanco delivered the 15th inning walk-off single to defeat the Tigers in Game 5 of the ALDS, then he opened the ALCS with the game-winning RBI single in Game 1 and the game-winning three-run home run in Game 2. He is 5 for 15 (.333) with a double, a homer, and 5 RBI four games into the ALCS. If the Mariners win the series, it's hard to think Polanco won't have played a major role in getting these last two wins. That makes him ALCS MVP favorite on Seattle's side.3. Andrés Giménez, Blue Jays \nThe No. 9 hitter swatting two-run homers in back-to-back games is the sort thing that creates Team of Destiny. Giménez did just that in Games 3 and 4, plus he drove in two more runs later in Game 4. It's the first time he's hit home runs in back-to-back games since Aug. 15, 2002, when he went deep in both ends of a doubleheader against the Tigers. Giménez is 5 for 14 (.357) with the two homers and 6 RBI in the ALCS. Shane Bieber, Bryce Miller, Josh Naylor, Cal Raleigh, Julio Rodríguez, Max Scherzer, and George Springer have all had a tremendous ALCS and could be MVP worthy when it's all said and done. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        If you were waiting for a Reed Sheppard breakout game, you got it on Thursday in the Rockets' preseason finale -- a 133-115 victory over the basically full-strength Hawks in which Sheppard rattled off 29 points in 29 minutes, six assists, six rebounds, four steals and three blocks.  Before we get to the offense, those seven stocks (steals + blocks) are a serious number and probably not a fluke. Sheppard blocked a ton a shots as a 6-foot-3 guard at Kentucky, and his disruptive defense was regarded as an element that could very well transfer to the NBA. This sequence is Sheppard at his best, poking a ball loose from Trae Young, one of the best handlers in the world, and pulling up for a 3 on the other end.  \nEven in limited action as a rookie, Sheppard averaged basically two steals and a block per 36 minutes last year. One of the reasons the Fred VanVleet injury feels like such a blow to Houston's title chances is the defense FVV provided at the top of possessions. Sheppard is more of a defensive playmaker as opposed to the guy who can jam up your whole possession with ball pressure and switchability, but nonetheless, the idea that he's a potential defensive liability might not have a ton of merit. We have to see it in real samples, but he could create havoc. And if that's the case, the ceiling might be pretty high for Sheppard given what most people think he can do on the offensive end, at least eventually, when and if he gets his opportunity to really cut loose. That's probably not going to happen this season given that Houston is going to be playing offense through the likes of Kevin Durant and Alperen Sengun, but on Thursday you saw Sheppard's total package in its most confident and unrestrained glory.  \nNotice the variety of Sheppard's scoring. Off the dribble. Off the catch. In the midrange, where he gets great lift and separation on his pull-ups. A comfortable floater. A crafty off-hand finish at the rim. Great vision as a passer out of pick and roll, slinging a bullet pass to the opposite corner for a 3. Drawing attention as a driver to set up a dump-off dunk.  Big news, NBA fans.

Claim your offer now: Sheppard had full control of the offense because Houston was sitting all its regulars. No Durant. No Sengun. No Jabari Smith, Amen Thompson, Tari Eason or Steven Adams. But importantly, Atlanta was playing all of its main guys other than Dyson Daniels. Sheppard was doing this against real competition, including Nickeil Alexander-Walker, one of the tougher perimeter defenders around.  \nSuffice it to say, this season represents a huge opportunity for Sheppard to step into the void left by VanVleet. Amen Thompson will probably be the starting point guard, at least as a de facto, but Sheppard's shooting is a weapon Thompson can't provide. The ultimate dream is for those two guys to share the back court as perfect complements, and we're going to see them together a lot this season.  Sheppard might not need to be a full-time starter for Houston right now, but make no mistake, with VanVleet out, and barring an in-season trade for an established point guard, Sheppard probably has to make a real impact this season if Houston is going to contend. He's the X-factor. Whether Thompson is ready to run point is a question, but he's going to be an awesome player one way or another. We know that. Just as we know what Durant and Sengun are going to do. And the defense.  Sheppard is the real unknown, and if he breaks out, it could genuinely swing Houston's contention needle. And watching him play like he did on on Thursday certainly gives you some real hope that can happen sooner than later.  \nNow, he won't get the kind of usage he got on Thursday, but still, you can see everything Sheppard's got in his bag when he really puts his foot on the gas. Houston certainly won't mind giving him an increasingly green light as the season progresses if he's scoring efficiently and holding up defensively, and if that happens, Houston becomes an even more dangerous team with this kind of point-guard threat.  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The stage is set in Minneapolis. The Philadelphia Eagles are landing in the Midwest. And it's Carson Wentz's time to shine.No, it is not February 2018. But even if it were, that wouldn't be true. That was supposed to be Wentz's time to shine. It had seemingly been written in the stars: A Midwestern kid ascending to MVP material, locked and loaded to lead the Eagles to their first Lombardi Trophy in the same stadium that housed his childhood team, the Minnesota Vikings.Except we all know the story: Wentz's magic ran out the second he tore his ACL in December of that breakout 2017 season. Well, a few seconds later, to be precise; he stayed on the field and threw a touchdown with ligaments shredded, then walked to the locker room under his own power, refusing to believe such a wrench had been thrown into his superstar arrival.No matter. By the end of the year, with green confetti falling, it was Nick Foles, his backup and improbably poised replacement, who got the glory. It was Foles, not Wentz, who outdueled Tom Brady, the most accomplished quarterback of all time, to upset the New England Patriots dynasty. And it was Foles, not Wentz, who got a statue outside Lincoln Financial Field, which stands to this day.\nEight years later, it's Wentz who's finally primed to get his shot. The stakes are much lower. This is Week 7, not the Super Bowl. He is a backup-turned-starter himself, trying to quietly write his own Foles story as the fill-in for the Minnesota Vikings' injured J.J. McCarthy. But it's a shot nonetheless, and the way Wentz's career spiraled after his exit from the Eagles, that's a minor miracle in itself. The fact it may culminate on Sunday, with Wentz wearing purple against Philly on the turf where that confetti fell, simply adds some Hollywood flair to the proceedings.The NFL is as much a reality show as a sports league. We tune in for the touchdowns, but we really want the drama. And nothing moves the needle quite like a comeback story. Or a revenge game. Both classifications may fit the bill for Wentz on Sunday. This is a guy who was briefly considered one of the top gunslingers in the sport. The next big thing. The indefinite face of the Eagles. Before long, he was a journeyman castoff, ribbed across social media for working out with an assortment of apparel from his countless pitstops: a streaky Colts run here, a dismal Commanders stretch there, a couple of backup gigs with the Rams and Chiefs to follow.Wentz insists, as any media-trained quarterback would, that Sunday's matchup with the Eagles, the team that drafted, paid and eventually traded him, means little more than any other game. He last took a snap with the Birds a half-decade ago. Only a select few players remain from the 2020 Eagles team that saw Wentz benched for current starter Jalen Hurts. In other words, Wentz is so far removed from his admitted Philly \"roller coaster\" that it'll be easy to tune them out as just another opponent. Or will it?\nThere's a reason Wentz tends to avoid the details of his meteoric rise and fall in the City of Brotherly Love. For one, why dwell on the past? The present is in Minnesota, where he's been on a game-by-game leash as the gutsy, if occasionally reckless, emergency starter while McCarthy heals a bad ankle. But another reason is that his Eagles breakup was thoroughly complicated. So complicated, in fact, that years later, it's still impossible to say one side was entirely right or wrong in the way the pairing soured.Here's the truth: Wentz struggled to replicate his 2017 dynamism after returning from his knee injury. He also did it with a mostly subpar group of weapons and an increasingly stale offense directed by coach Doug Pederson, who experienced a similar flameout with the Jacksonville Jaguars. Wentz didn't always help his cause by holding the ball in hopes of playing hero, only to lose the ball at an alarming rate by his final season in green. He also had the unique challenge of trying to retain and maintain the support of an avid fan base and forward-thinking front office, despite signing a lucrative contract.The Eagles, remember, literally built a statue of his replacement after the Super Bowl. They also spent an early draft pick on Hurts, a potential successor, one year after Wentz helped guide the team back to the playoffs. Should those have been death knells in his Eagles career if he were, as many critics argued he should've been, more mentally resilient and motivated to prove the naysayers wrong with smarter play?\nOn one hand, all indications from credible reports are that Wentz is the one who facilitated the final departure from Philly. The 2020 season ended in turmoil, with young Hurts thrust into the lineup by a burnt-out Pederson, and Wentz had had enough. He preferred the fresh start. A clean slate. In that way, looking back, it's hard to say he can enter Sunday's matchup with the Eagles -- who are quite removed from the Pederson regime, by the way -- with justified disdain for Philly. They granted him what he wanted, after all: an escape from the once-promising but drama-tinged marriage. But could the Eagles have done more to support him while he was around? Might he be motivated, all these years later, to prove he was always worth a greater investment?Who are we kidding? This is football. Whether or not players say it, almost all of them are fueled by an innate desire to win. To trample the competition. To achieve what the skeptics say they cannot. Who cares if some of the doubts are self-created? When the ball is kicked, the lights are bright, the crowd is roaring and the pass rush is live, you can bet Wentz is going to feel a little extra juice when he's rifling the rock against a team from Philadelphia with wings on its helmets.His Eagles career will always be remembered as a what-if story: so much talent, so much energy, and such an undeniable role in arguably the most magical season in team history, yet all of it clouded in part by the fact two sides couldn't resolve their awkward differences once the goings got tough. Years and years from now, that will probably remain the story. The Eagles have certainly made out just fine since: Hurts turned out to be the right bet, bringing unmatched composure and clutch fortitude to the position, helping the Eagles reach two Super Bowls (and win one) in a span of three years. Granted, he was afforded much sturdier setups, with all-world weapons like Saquon Barkley and A.J. Brown, but his own persona helped steady the entire ship.\nAs for Wentz? This very moment, on this particular Sunday in October, he has a chance -- perhaps his last -- to put a little footnote, a little epilogue, on his own saga as the franchise quarterback. Can big No. 11 -- the misunderstood hero and/or his own worst enemy -- remind Eagles faithful of the otherworldly gifts and gusto that once elevated Philadelphia? Can he take his biggest step yet to becoming the Vikings' unexpected darling, even en route to his own unlikely postseason run?The stage is set in Minneapolis. The Philadelphia Eagles are landing in the Midwest. And it's Wentz's time to shine.  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        CINCINNATI -- Aaron Rodgers had a rough night in Cincinnati on Thursday. During the Steelers' 33-31 loss to the Bengals, an angry Rodgers got into it with two different teammates, and in both situations, he had every right to be upset. In the first quarter, Rodgers was caught on camera yelling at Steelers running back Jaylen Warren after Pittsburgh ran a flea flicker on a play that apparently wasn't supposed to be a flea flicker. Warren took a handoff from Rodgers and then pitched back to the quarterback, who immediately had to throw the ball in the ground. \nFollowing the play, Rodgers walked over to Warren and made it clear he wasn't happy. \nAfter the game, Rodgers was asked about that specific play and whether Warren was supposed to pitch him the ball. \n\"It wasn't supposed to be a flea flicker,\" Rodgers said. \"We weren't on the same page.\"There was definitely some sort of miscommunication, and it wasn't just with Warren -- Mike Tomlin also thought it was supposed to be a flea flicker. Following the loss, the Steelers head coach was asked directly if \"a flea flicker was called\" in the first half. \"It was,\" Tomlin said. Normally, you'd defer to the quarterback here and assume he's right, but Rodgers is in just his sixth game with the Steelers, so it's certainly possible there was some confusion on his end. Either way, Tomlin and Warren thought it was a flea flicker and Rodgers is clearly adamant it was not. \n\n        \n            \n                Overreactions after Bengals' win over Steelers: Joe Flacco saves season? Aaron Rodgers to rethink retirement?\n                \n                    Jeff Kerr                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIn the fourth quarter, Rodgers got so upset with a different teammate that he actually pushed him. After the quarterback threw a 68-yard touchdown pass to Pat Freiermuth that put Pittsburgh up 31-30 with just 2:21 left to play, the Steelers started celebrating. Offensive lineman Broderick Jones decided to celebrate the score by TACKLING Rodgers, and as you can see below, the four-time NFL MVP was NOT happy. \nRodgers actually shoved Jones before walking to the sideline. It's easy to see why Rodgers was upset here: Jones weighs more than 300 pounds, so Rodgers very easily could have been injured. When you're a 300-pound offensive lineman and you have a 41-year-old quarterback, you should never tackle him under any circumstance. \nRodgers did have an impressive night against the Bengals, throwing for 249 yards and four touchdowns, but he also threw two interceptions. It was a painful loss for the quarterback, who had his team on the cusp of a win before watching the Bengals pull out the victory on a last-second field goal. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        After a rough patch, we're pretty hot here on best bets in the last several days. In the past two, specifically, we went 4-1. The lone loss was needing 3+ hits plus runs plus RBI from Shohei Ohtani. He led off the game with a triple and then scored and then did nothing the rest of the game. That's a tough loss or, as the parlance goes, a bad beat. Still, four of five in the past two day is good vibes and we're gonna keep those going. Friday night brings us ALCS Game 5 with the Mariners and Blue Jays tied 2-2, and then NLCS Game 4 as the Dodgers go for a sweep of the Brewers. Lines courtesy of FanDuel. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. 2+ total bases (-105)Time to ride the wave. Vlad is 15 for 33 with two doubles and five home runs in eight playoff games so far this postseason. That's 32 total bases or an average of exactly four per game. We could get home with two singles here, but a double or home run does it in one plate appearance. One of the games where Guerrero did nothing was Game 1 of the ALCS with Bryce Miller on the mound. He was 0 for 4, but look deeper. He hit the ball hard. In fact, he scorched it. His lineout in the first was over 107 miles per hour and his groundout on his second at-bat was 109. He hit two of the five hardest balls in the game. I love him getting another look at Miller with a quick turnaround, especially given how locked in Vlad Jr. feels right now. \nDodgers -1.5 (+104) and Shohei Ohtani o6.5 K (-104)The Brewers have shown a few instances of fight, but overall they're just flailing. The Dodgers are on another level. After taking back-to-back walk-off losses in Baltimore in early September, the Dodgers won 15 of 20 to close the season and now have gone 8-1 in the playoffs. The starting pitching is completely overwhelming the Brewers Punch-and-Judy offense.I'm expecting more of the same here. Shohei Ohtani has 71 strikeouts against 10 walks in 53 innings between the regular season and playoffs this year. He's done a slow build to get to this point after recovering from elbow surgery, but he's now a frontline starter. The Brewers have never faced him with the overwhelming majority of the offense having never seen him in MLB action. The unfamiliarity will pay off. He'll deal. I've got him going six innings, maybe even seven, with at least a strikeout per inning. The number here is in a good enough place to play it. \nAs for the run line, I'm expecting the Brewers to score very few runs, so we only need the Dodgers' offense to have a rally or two. This play hit in Game 3 despite Jacob Misiorowski throwing extremely well for the Brewers and he's out for Game 4. They won't have quite the same level of run prevention in this one. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        It's Year 8 of the Trae Young era, and the Atlanta Hawks are on their third general manager and third coach. Since making the conference finals in 2021, they've won between 36 and 43 games every season, with a cumulative record of 160-168. There is a sense of optimism around and about the team, though, after a series of moves that might have given Young the best supporting cast he's ever had. The Hawks have size and length across the positional spectrum and they have dogged defenders at the point of attack. They've surrounded Young with playmakers and shooters, including one particularly big offseason addition: Kristaps Porziņģis, one of the stretchiest 5s in NBA history. In theory, it should be tougher to stop Young, more dangerous to blitz him and harder to exploit him defensively. \nThere's a lot to be excited about in Atlanta. On the other hand, there's a fair bit of uncertainty. Young, Porziņģis and Dyson Daniels are all eligible for contract extensions, and it's possible that the front office, now led by Onsi Saleh, will not make a deal with any of them before the season starts. Beyond that, the franchise is betting on continued improvement from 23-year-old forward Jalen Johnson, 20-year-old wing Zaccharie Risacher and Daniels, who is 22 and won Most Improved Player last season but still derives the vast majority of his value from his work on one end of the floor. This could be one of the best teams in the East, but the Hawks have to prove that they're ready for primetime. \n The State of Play Last year: With Young and Johnson on the floor, the Hawks outscored opponents by 4.3 points per 100 possessions. They shared the floor for only 924 minutes in 34 games, though, because Johnson had a season-ending shoulder injury in January. Other positives: Daniels' big breakout, Risacher's strong finish (after a slow start) and the late-season production of Onyeka Okongwu and Mo Gueye. At the trade deadline, Atlanta sold high on De'Andre Hunter, sending him to Cleveland for Caris LeVert, Georges Niang, two-second round picks and two pick-swaps. It also sent Bogdan Bogdanovic and three second-round picks to the Clippers for Terance Mann. In the end, the Hawks finished the regular season 40-42 and then lost play-in games against Orlando and Miami. The offseason: Shortly after the overtime loss against the Heat, the Hawks fired GM Landry Fields and promoted Saleh. And Saleh hit a home run extremely early in his tenure: On draft night, they traded down from No. 13 to No. 23 and picked up the Pelicans' unprotected 2026 first-round pick (with swap rights on the Bucks' 2026 pick!) in the process. At No. 23, they picked big man Asa Newell. They also traded the No. 22 pick (along with Mann, Niang and a 2031 second-round pick) for Porziņģis and a 2026 second-round pick. LeVert left for the Pistons, but Atlanta acquired Nickeil Alexander-Walker in a sign-and-trade (4 years, $60.6 million, player option), sending Minnesota a 2027 second-round pick. It also signed Luke Kennard (one year, $11 million), signed N'Faly Dante to a two-year minimum contract and signed Caleb Houstan to an Exhibit 10 contract. Clint Capela went back to Houston in a sign-and-trade, Larry Nance Jr. left for the Cavs, Garrison Mathews left for the Knicks and, sadly, Atlanta dumped Kobe Bufkin, the No. 15 pick in the 2023 draft, to the Nets. Las Vegas over/under: 46.5 wins, per FanDuel Sportsbook  The Conversation Hawks believer: Ca-caw! I couldn't be more pumped about the Hawks, and, when I look back at the 2023-24 roster, I'm blown away. Trae Young, Jalen Johnson and Onyeka Okongwu are still core players, obviously, but Vit Krejčí and Mo Gueye are the only other guys who have stuck around. Getting Dyson Daniels in the Dejounte Murray trade in the summer of 2024 was brilliant, and now that they have Kristaps Porziņģis and Nickeil Alexander-Walker, they're legit. Please remember that Johnson was playing like an All-Star before his injury and that Zaccharie Risacher was the league's best rookie for the last couple of months of the 2024-25 season. I'm thrilled for Quin Snyder, but I also sort of feel bad for him -- with seven starting-caliber players, how is he going to determine who starts and finishes from night to night? \nHawks skeptic: The Hawks hype machine has been in full force for a while now, and you're only putting more pressure on them! To be clear, I like the moves they made. The Porziņģis trade made sense because they didn't want the Terance Mann and Georges Niang contracts anyway and they needed to replace the clearly declining Clint Capela. Alexander-Walker was a solid pickup and the Wolves shouldn't have let him get away. Kennard should help the offense in the non-Young minutes. After the top eight, though, we're talking about fringe rotation players all the way down. Do you think Asa Newell is going to be a winning player as a rookie? Are you confident in Gueye and Krejčí contributing to a \"legit\" team on a nightly basis? Are you going to try to sell me on N'Faly Dante and Nikola Đurišić? Caleb Houstan probably has the best track record of any of these guys, but I'm not even positive he'll be on the opening-night roster. Hawks believer: Actually, I do think there's a good chance Newell can be a winning player as a rookie. With his mobility, he'll be a solid, switchable defender right away, and he'll be fine with being the fifth option on offense. Gueye and Krejčí are totally fine players to have in the back end of a rotation, too, and the Hawks must be encouraged by how both of them developed last season. The former was an absolute menace defensively, and the latter was effective as a shooter and a secondary playmaker. You make it sound like Atlanta has a huge depth problem, but there's a great deal of lineup versatility here because so many of these guys can guard multiple positions. Hawks skeptic: Let's see how the Hawks' second unit fares. Last season, when Young wasn't on the court, they scored 109.9 points per 100 possessions (which roughly equates to a bottom-four offense) in non-garbage-time minutes, per Cleaning The Glass. Maybe that number will be a bit better in 2025-26, but, I'd like to drill down on what's actually changed. They've effectively replaced Capela with Porziņģis (for 50-60 games, maybe), Caris LeVert with Alexander-Walker (a better defender but inferior creator), Mann with Kennard (a much better shooter but much worse defender), and Niang with Asa Newell (a project). That adds up to a good offseason, but not a franchise-changing one. I'd still like them to find a proper backup point guard, and I feel like people on the internet are a bit too high on them because people on the internet have always loved Johnson, Daniels, Okongwu and Alexander-Walker. \nHawks believer: Don't forget that the Hawks fleeced the Pelicans on draft night. That one move made this an A+++ offseason, let alone all the other transactions that have collectively made this the best and most balanced roster Atlanta has seen since 2015. You're not properly accounting for the effect that Porziņģis -- a 7-foot-2 dude who is a real threat 30 feet from the basket -- is going to have on the offense. I remember the Hawks trying to use guys like Gorgui Dieng and Dewayne Dedmon as floor spacers, and I promise you that Young has never played with anybody remotely like this. Porziņģis' presence will be huge for Okongwu, too, not just because it will turn the 24-year-old into a Sixth Man of the Year candidate but because his still-developing 3-point shot is no longer of enormous importance. And why, exactly, must there be a conventional point guard on the second unit? Personally, I want to see Daniels and Alexander-Walker share the backcourt and create chaos on defense. I also want to give Johnson as much playmaking responsibility as he can handle. Under Snyder, the promise of this team is that, while it could simply give the ball to Young and run spread pick-and-roll every time down, it will instead empower Johnson, Risacher, Daniels, Alexander-Walker, Kennard and Krejčí to initiate actions. All of them can make quick, smart reads and keep the defense on its heels. Hawks skeptic: The trade with New Orleans was a miracle, but, unless the Hawks trade that pick before the February deadline, it's not helping them this season. And I think it contributed to the spread of Atlantamania, which seems to have afflicted a lot of analysts over the past few months. I'm sorry to be a downer, but the Hawks haven't accomplished anything since their conference finals appearance in 2021, and if they win 41 to 45 games this season, it's going to feel like a disappointment. While they have the potential to be better than that and maybe even get back to the conference finals, the sudden, dramatic increase in expectations is too much, too soon. Forget my concerns about depth; I'm not even sure what Risacher is going to be on a night-to-night basis in Year 2. And if Johnson is supposed to be the Hawks' second star, then I don't know if Daniels is a viable long-term starter, given that neither of them spaces the floor. The new look is intriguing, for sure, but, especially if Young, Daniels and Porziņģis don't sign extensions, the team could look a lot different this time next year. \n            ",

Beck was a high-profile transfer portal addition from Georgia at the end of last year, but Louisville made a splash of its own in adding Miller Moss from USC. Moss threw for 2,555 yards and 18 touchdowns with nine interceptions at USC last year, and the fifth-year senior has thrown for more than 300 yards in three straight games for Louisville. Miami is the No. 2 team in the nation for good reason, but Louisville is 4-1 with its only loss coming in overtime against Virginia, who is 5-1 and ranked No. 18 in the nation. The Cardinals had a bye last week, so with additional time to rest and prepare, the model projects Louisville to cover the spread in 68% of simulations. Back Louisville at DraftKings, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Brewers to defeat the Dodgers (+167)The Brewers are one loss away from being swept, and although only one team has come back from being down 3-0 in postseason history, Milwaukee doesn't need to win all four games in one day. After having the best record in baseball (97-65) this season, the model expects a better final performance from the Brewers than exiting via sweep. Milwaukee also had the best road record in baseball at 45-36 this year. The Dodgers are starting Shohei Ohtani, and although the two-way superstar has pitched well over the past few months, he's only thrown 53 innings this season. The Brewers had the third-best scoring offense at 4.98 runs per game during the regular season, and the model projects value in them in this win-or-go-home matchup.

The Tar Heels are 102nd in yards per play allowed (6.0) and 97th in yards per game (417.3). Cal is coming off allowing 45 points to Duke, and the Golden Bears have allowed 34.3 ppg over their last three contests, so both offenses could take advantage of less-than-stellar defensive performances lately.

    "body": "\n        No. 2 Miami returns to action out of an off week with a Friday night home game against one of the ACC's top programs, welcoming Louisville to town in the latest test for the Hurricanes' unbeaten start to the 2025 season. With a huge rivalry win against Florida State in the rear view, Mario Cristobal's squad is now focused on finishing strong and securing a spot in the ACC Championship Game, which is the first step to winning the first ACC title in program history.  Louisville also had last week off but entered its break on a far different note, falling in overtime at home to Virginia back in Week 6. The Cardinals got 329 yards passing and three total touchdowns (two passing, one rushing) from quarterback Miller Moss in the effort, but lost the turnover battle and gave up a walk-off touchdown on the second possession of overtime. At 4-1 overall, Louisville can still accomplish its goals of similarly competing for an ACC title, but that likely requires taking down the top-5 Canes in their own house on Friday night.  Bet Louisville vs. Miami at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass with a winning $5 wager:Miami leads the all-time series with a 12-4-1 record, though Mario Cristobal and Jeff Brohm have split their meetings since taking over as head coaches at their respective alma maters. Louisville won 38-31 in 2023 en route to locking up a spot in the ACC title game, then last season Miami got revenge with a 52-45 win in Louisville last year.  \n   Miami vs. Louisville: Need to know   Carson Beck's resurgence drives the Miami offense: Trying to fill the shoes for Cam Ward was going to be no easy task, but Carson Beck has found similar success without trying to replicate Ward's game. Beck ranks in the top five nationally in completion percentage and has done a great job of staying patient behind one of the best offensive lines in the country to dissect opposing defenses. The Hurricanes aren't putting up the same eye-popping offensive numbers as they did in 2024, but when Beck needs to take over he has shown he is capable of doing so like his 4 touchdown, no interception performance in the win against Florida State.   Miami defense boasting one of the best DE tandems in the country: The combination of Akheem Mesidor and Rueben Bain Jr. have taken Miami's defense to a terrifying new level in 2025. The group needed a reset as new defensive coordinator Corey Heatherman took over a unit that was falling short of expectations, and with a new scheme and some healthier weapons the defense has become an absolute strength this season. Mesidor and Bain are among the best in the country when it comes to pressuring the quarterback, and their unique advantages change the way offenses have to adjust their play-calling particularly in key downs. Miami ranks second in the ACC and 14th nationally in third down defense, with that pass rush playing a key part.  Chris Bell stepping up in ACC play for Louisville: Louisville wide receiver Chris Bell has been one of the best pass catchers in ACC play, totaling 22 receptions for 305 yards and three touchdowns over the last two games. Bell was a machine in the loss to Virginia, racking up 12 receptions for a career-high 170 yards and two scores, becoming the first Louisville player since 2020 to have 170+ receiving yards in a game. Quarterback Miller Moss has been tasked with shouldering more of the offensive load as the Cardinals have dealt with some nagging and minor injuries in the running back room, and he's responded by elevating his production with the help of Bell's outstanding work at wide receiver.  \n   Where to watch Miami vs. Louisville live   Date: Friday, Oct. 17 | Time: 7 p.m. ET   Location: Hard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Florida   TV: ESPN | Live stream: Fubo (Start watching, save $20!)

The Hurricanes don't do anything too exotic, they just have elite players who pin their ears back, win battles in the trenches and get after the quarterback. That's going to make for a long evening for Miller Moss so even if Miami's offense is a little slow out of the gates over the course of the game the Hurricanes should be able to cover the

    "body": "\n        The Championship Series is in full swing but it never too early to begin looking ahead to the offseason. Game 7 of the World Series is scheduled for Saturday, Nov 1. One way or another, games will be over in no less than 15 days, then before you know it, the trades and free agent signings will begin. Here are a few early hot stove nuggets.$250 million gap in Skubal extension talks\nThere was a $250 million gap in extension talks between the Tigers and reigning AL Cy Young winner Tarik Skubal last offseason, reports the New York Post. The Detroit Free Press says the Tigers offered four years and less than $100 million last year, indicating Skubal was seeking $350 million or so. That would be the richest contract ever for a pitcher, beating Yoshinobu Yamamoto's $325 million contract with the Dodgers.Even with the understanding that Skubal was two years away from free agency at the time, four years and under $100 million is a laughable offer. Garrett Crochet, with just one year of an above-average starter under his belt, secured a six-year deal worth $170 million at the same service time level. Skubal, 29 next week, is a Scott Boras client and one year away from free agency. Our R.J. Anderson recently broke down Detroit's options with their ace, including the possibility of a trade.\nPhillies expected to trade or release Castellanos\nAs part of their efforts to reshape their outfield, the Phillies are expected to trade or release Nick Castellanos this offseason, according to The Athletic. Lead exec Dave Dombrowski declined to discuss Castellanos' future during the team's end-of-season press conference Thursday. Castellanos, 34 in March, is owed $20 million in 2026, the final year on his contract. He does not have any no-trade protection.Castellanos had the worst offensive season of his career in 2025, and he was moved into a platoon role late in the year. He's never been a good defender and now he's borderline unplayable in the outfield. It goes without saying that an aging DH with a below-average bat and a $20 million salary is not a hot trade commodity. The best-case scenario is a bad contract for bad contract swap. It is more likely Philadelphia will have to eat the $20 million and release Castellanos.\nGuardians re-sign Hedges\nThe Guardians acted quickly to re-sign their backup catcher. The club has brought back Austin Hedges on a one-year deal worth $4 million, the team announced earlier this week. Hedges, 33, spent the last two seasons in Cleveland. He is arguably the worst hitter in baseball (career .185/.244/.313), though he is a standout defender and pitch-framer behind the plate. Hedges is also an excellent clubhouse guy who has taken on a mentorship role with Bo Naylor, Cleveland's young starting backstop.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Some of college football's most heated rivalries take center stage as the second half of the 2025 season gets underway in Week 8. Saturday's slate is sure to shift the national landscape, as we are now just over two weeks away from the first College Football Playoff rankings reveal of the season. Week 8 is home to five games between opponents ranked inside the AP Top 25 poll. That's more than any other weekend this season. It's a particularly impactful week for the SEC, which is home to three games featuring two ranked teams. No. 9 Georgia hosts No. 5 Ole Miss as it looks to avenge last season's loss. Meanwhile, No. 11 Tennessee travels for its 108th meeting all-time against No. 6 Alabama in a clash that is crucial for each program's postseason hopes. \n        \n            \n                Parity has arrived in college football -- and there's a ton of data to back it up\n                \n                    Chris Hummer                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDon't sleep on No. 17 Vanderbilt's home game against No. 10 LSU, either. That's a must-win for both schools if they want to stay in the national conversation. \nWhich games should you actually pay attention to Saturday? Here's a viewer's guide to help you navigate the Week 8 action.All times EasternThe best games No. 10 LSU at No. 17 Vanderbilt -- noon on ABC, fuboTV (try for free): Vanderbilt is favored against LSU for the first time since 1948. This also snaps a streak of 176-straight games as a betting underdog for the Commodores. That's a testament to the work that coach Clark Lea has done in his five seasons in Nashville. This is, obviously, a huge test for the program that he's built. Win here and Vanderbilt control its own destiny when it comes to the College Football Playoff. No. 5 Ole Miss at No. 9 Georgia -- 3:30 p.m. on ABC, fuboTV (try for free): Ole Miss was a thorn in Georgia's side last season, as the Rebels dominated the Bulldogs for a 28-10 victory. That was Ole Miss' first win against Georgia since 1996. That 1995-96 timespan was also the last time that the Rebels triumphed over the Bulldogs in back-to-back seasons. Though this isn't necessarily a must-win for either team, Georgia already has a loss on its ledger. Another would put it on the playoff bubble as the second half of the season starts. \nNo. 1 Ohio State at Wisconsin -- 3:30 p.m. on CBS, CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App, Paramount+ Premium: Wisconsin is a 25.5-point underdog on its own home turf, according to FanDuel Sportsbook. So it's fair to say that, at this point, third-year boss Luke Fickell is coaching for his job. The Badgers are 0-3 in Big Ten play. They have yet to beat a Power Four conference foe and each of their last four losses have come by at least 14 points. Meanwhile, Ohio State is Ohio State. The Buckeyes are the early favorites to repeat as national champions. The path is wide open. Thanks to Penn State's precipitous fall and Michigan's continued struggles, Ohio State doesn't have another currently ranked opponent left on its schedule. No. 11 Tennessee at No. 6 Alabama -- 7:30 p.m. on ABC, fuboTV (try for free):  The \"Third Saturday in October\" has undergone a resurrection in recent years as Tennessee has made the series more competitive under coach Josh Heupel. The Vols are 2-1 against one of their top rivals over the last three seasons. Both of those wins came at home. Tennessee has not won in Tuscaloosa since 2003. Alabama has won 15 straight home games, which is tied with Boise State for the longest such streak among FBS programs. No. 20 USC at No. 13 Notre Dame -- 7:30 p.m. on NBC, fuboTV (try for free): USC revitalized its season in Week 7 with a dominant 31-13 win against Michigan, returning to the AP Top 25 poll for the second time this season in the process. Though the Trojans had to rely on walk-on King Miller as their primary running back for most of the game due to a litany of injuries, they still rushed for 224 yards against Michigan's traditionally stout defense. It will be interesting to see how USC matches up against a Notre Dame team that has taken a step back defensively. \nNo. 23 Utah at No. 15 BYU -- 8 p.m. on Fox, fuboTV (try for free): The Holy War is often one of the most entertaining -- and underrated -- rivalries in college football. This year should be no different. It's hard to overstate how important this game is for each team, even without considering the fact that they do not like each other. Whoever comes out victorious takes a significant advantage in the race for the Big 12 Championship Game, and perhaps even beyond. Best of the rest No. 12 Georgia Tech at Duke -- noon on ESPN, fuboTV (try for free) Washington at Michigan -- noon on Fox, fuboTV (try for free) Central Michigan at Bowling Green -- Noon on CBS Sports Network, CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App No. 14 Oklahoma at South Carolina -- 12:45 p.m. on SEC Network, fuboTV (try for free) \nMichigan State at No. 3 Indiana -- 3:30 p.m. on Peacock No. 4 Texas A&M at Arkansas -- 3:30 p.m. on ESPN, fuboTV (try for free)  SMU at Clemson -- 3:30 p.m. on ACC Network, fuboTV (try for free)  UNLV at Boise State -- 3:30 p.m. on FS1, fuboTV (try for free) Wyoming at Air Force -- 3:30 p.m. on CBS Sports Network, CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App No. 7 Texas Tech at Arizona State -- 4 p.m. on Fox, fuboTV (try for free) No. 21 Texas at Kentucky -- 7 p.m. on ESPN, fuboTV (try for free)  No. 16 Missouri at Auburn -- 7:45 p.m. on SEC Network, fuboTV (try for free)  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        It's a top-10 matchup in the SEC as No. 9 Georgia plays host to No. 5 Ole Miss in a game that will have major ramifications in the SEC title race as well as the College Football Playoff. It could be argued this game is something of a must-win for the Bulldogs, since they've already lost a conference game against Alabama. A second loss in SEC play would make it difficult for the Dawgs to climb to the top two and reach the SEC Championship Game in Atlanta.If that were to happen it would be the first time Georgia didn't play in the game since 2020, and only the second time in the last nine seasons.A win for Ole Miss would give the Rebels an inside track to their first ever appearance in the game. They're already 3-0 in conference play, and given what's left on their schedule, they'd have a good shot of getting through conference play with only one loss.Georgia vs. Ole Miss: Need to know  Georgia has been outscored in the first half of three of four SEC games: Slow starts are becoming the norm for the Bulldogs in conference play. They've been outscored 62-55 in the first half of their four games, and trailed at halftime against Tennessee, Georgia and Auburn. The good news for the Dawgs is they've outscored SEC teams 59-24 after halftime to overcome two of those three deficits. Still, you have to think Kirby Smart would like to see his team get off to better starts.  The Rebels are running hot against top-10 teams: Ole Miss has won three straight games against top-10 opponents, which is the second-longest streak in school history (they won four straight in 1969). That includes a win a few weeks ago against then-No. 4 LSU as well as last year's win over then No. 3 Georgia. However, the Rebels are 0-12 lifetime when facing a ranked Georgia team on the road. \nGeorgia owns October: Losing in October just isn't something the Dawgs do. They've won 17 straight October games, which is the longest October win streak in the country. Their last lost during the month was against Alabama back in the 2020 season.  Where to watch Georgia vs. Ole Miss live  Date: Saturday, Oct. 18 | Time: 3:30 p.m. ET  Location: Sanford Stadium -- Athens, Georgia  TV: ABC | Live stream: Fubo (Start watching, save $20!)Georgia vs. Ole Miss prediction, picks  \nI don't have a great feel for this one overall. If you want to get really creative based on how trends have worked in Georgia games this year, take Ole Miss in the first half and Georgia in the third quarter. Maybe even parlay it. For a more traditional play, I'd argue taking Georgia and the points. So far in SEC play home teams have gone 14-6-1 against the spread, and Ole Miss has not had much success at Sanford Stadium. Pick: Georgia -7.5\n\n                    \n    \n

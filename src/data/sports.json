    "body": "\n        The middle of February may seem too early for Fantasy Football projections. 'Seem' may not be a strong enough word in that first sentence. Free agency is right around the corner but the NFL Draft won't happen for two more months. It is way too early. But that doesn't mean it isn't helpful to take a snapshot before things get crazy.The first thing you will notice when you look at the projections below is that Kenneth Walker III, Breece Hall, Travis Etienne, Javonte Williams, and many other free agents are not listed. It is hard to project a running back when we don't know what team they will be on, so I will add them when they either get tagged or signed in free agency. Walker and Hall seem like the most likely to receive the franchise tag, which could be good for Walker and not so much for Hall.The Seahawks and Jets are just two teams that should be in the market for a running back. I also have the Chiefs, Jaguars, Broncos, Commanders, and Cowboys projected with less than half of their teams running back attempts accounted for. Two of those teams have rookies that could be big offseason winners if their team doesn't make a significant investment at the position. That seems to be factored into the market for RJ Harvey right now, but not as much for Jacory Croskey-Merritt. For now, I expect both to be in timeshares in 2026.The very top of the projections at running back gives us two interesting names. It probably isn't a surprise that Christian McCaffrey tops the list. When he's been healthy he has generally been the best back in Fantasy. But his rushing efficiency cratered last year and most of his value was an outsized role in the passing game. If the 49ers add pass catchers will that impact McCaffrey more than most running backs? If nothing else, the fact that McCaffrey turns 30 in June could keep him from being ranked or drafted as RB1.\nThe other interesting name is De'Von Achane. Achane was one of my favorite backs this time last year and he more than justified that. I'm just not sure anyone realizes how special he was in his specific context. The Dolphins ran only 949 offensive plays last year, which ranked 31st in the NFL. They ranked 25th in points and 26th in yards. Somehow, Achane still averaged 114.8 yards per game, caught 67 passes, and scored 12 times in 16 games. If the Dolphins offense improves even a little bit Achane has a very good chance of being the number one running back in Fantasy.There are three other backs that project for close to 20 points per game: Bijan Robinson, Jahmyr Gibbs, and Jonathan Taylor. Along with McCaffrey and Achane these are the five backs who should be Round 1 picks in every one-QB draft.\nBelow are my way-too-early running back projections for 2026. Bookmark this page as I will update the projections below whenever we get new information.\n            ",

Back to Riviera Country Club after being unable to use the golf course due to the Los Angeles wildfires in 2025, the PGA Tour's best players will partake in the second signature event of the season with a significant purse on the line.Unlike last week's AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, the Genesis Invitational will feature a cut at the 36-hole mark (one of three signature events that slice the field), trimming the field to the top 50 players and ties, along with those within 10 strokes of the leader.That should not be a problem for world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler, who headlines a field that features 18 of the top 20 players in the Official World Golf Rankings. Scheffler returns to Riviera for the first time with a mallet putter in his bag, as this was the site in 2024 where his frustrations on the greens reached a boiling point.The run he has been on since, which includes 18 straight top 10 finishes dating back to March 2025, has been leagues above the rest of the world. Still, Scheffler is seeking his first win at Riviera -- a golf course neither Tiger Woods nor Jack Nicklaus were unable to conquer during their careers.Speaking of Woods, while he will not be playing this week, he serves as the tournament's host once again. The 15-time major champion handed the trophy to Ludvig Åberg at Torrey Pines last year, and he has previously shaken the hands of Genesis Invitational champions in the field like Hideki Matsuyama and Max Homa.\nWorld No. 2 Rory McIlroy hopes that it will be him this weekend as he makes start No. 2 on the PGA Tour this season. McIlroy played well in his season debut at Pebble Beach, where he effectively returned to his blade irons, but he was ultimately upended by others' big numbers on the scorecard.Californians Xander Schauffele, J.J. Spaun, Patrick Cantlay, Sahith Theegala and Homa hope to win in their home state. Meanwhile, Justin Rose, Collin Morikawa and Scheffler aim to grab their second wins of the season, joining Chris Gotterup as a multiple-time winner before the calendar flips to March.2026 Genesis Invitational scheduleDates: Feb. 19-22Location: The Riviera Country Club — Pacific Palisades, CaliforniaPar: 71 | Yardage: 7,383 | Architect: G.C. Thomas, Jr. // W.P. BellPurse: $20,000,000\n2026 Genesis Invitational field, oddsOdds via DraftKings SportsbookScottie Scheffler (3-1)Rory McIlroy (15-1): Where McIlroy wins at this stage in his career matters almost as much as what he wins, and a potential trophy at Riviera certainly piques his interest. McIlroy played better as the rounds progressed at Pebble Beach; all he needed to do was clean up the scorecard, which he did Sunday by maneuvering through the course without a bogey en route to a closing 64. McIlroy had a run of three top 10s across four tournament appearances at Riviera from 2019-22 but hasn't been at his best in his last two trips.Xander Schauffele (23-1): Schauffele is making slight improvements by the week with a top 20 finish at Pebble Beach providing a glimpse into his game being closer than it may appear. The two-time major champion is driving the ball beautifully, just needing to clean up some stuff on and around the greens to start being competitive again. This should be a good spot for him, as he had a chance to win this tournament on the back nine in 2024 before Matsuyama made his run.Tommy Fleetwood (23-1): Quietly snuck his way into a T4 finish at Pebble Beach last week where he did everything extremely well. After some middling play in the Middle East, the reigning FedEx Cup champion looked like the player who raised that trophy at the Tour Championship last year. He has improved in every trip to Riviera with finishes of T37, T28, T20 and T10 to his name. If that trend continues, Fleetwood will be in the mix come Sunday.Hideki Matsuyama (25-1): One of many recent Masters winners to reign supreme at Riviera alongside the likes of Adam Scott, Bubba Watson and Dustin Johnson. Matsuyama returns this year in stellar form after notching four straight top 13 finishes with his playoff loss at the WM Phoenix Open and T8 at Pebble Beach hindered by his driving. There will be no hiding from that club this week, but if he figures it out, he has as good a chance as anyone to step into that winner's circle.Russell Henley (25-1)Cameron Young (29-1)Patrick Cantlay (29-1)Sam Burns (31-1)Collin Morikawa (31-1): Stating that he finally started to play golf and not \"golf swing\" again, the results followed for Morikawa. He was probably overdue for a win with the number of close calls he had experienced since that 2023 Zozo Championship victory, and it came on the shoulders of his typically elite iron play. No one is suggesting he's suddenly back to being a top five player in the world, even if the Official World Golf Rankings say as much; his short game still has ample room for improvement.2026 Genesis Invitational picks\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Scottie Scheffler\n                    \n            \n            \n        \nWinner (3-1): If Scheffler doesn't start by spotting the field 10 strokes on Thursday, he should be atop the leaderboard on Sunday. That's what Scheffler has done the past two weeks, and he nearly pulled off the impossible at Pebble Beach on Sunday by overcoming an eight-stroke deficit thanks to a three-eagle performance and a final-round 63. Scheffler is stunting with the driver and short game at the moment, and if his iron play starts to behave like it did Sunday, he should grab his second trophy of the season.\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Harris English\n                    \n            \n            \n        \nContender (45-1): Not too many players are driving the ball more efficiently than English at the moment. A winner in California last season at Torrey Pines, English should have a chance to raise another trophy in the Golden State at a golf course where he has racked up finishes of solo seventh and T12 in his last two trips. In four starts this season, English has four to -30 finishes but no top 20 finishes. That could change this week given his proficiency with the mid irons.\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Ryan Gerard\n                    \n            \n            \n        \nSleeper (75-1): Not too many youngsters are going to fare well at Riviera their first time seeing it, but Gerard may be the exception. Now that the shine has worn off via a T45 finish at Pebble Beach, the 26-year-old price has taken a hit and we will happily be there to scoop it up. He started his year with three straight top 11 finishes, and his game translates better to some of the more legitimate tests on the PGA Tour.\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                                            ",

Carano last fought professionally in August 2009, when she suffered the first and only loss of her career to Cris Cyborg in a Strikeforce event. Since then, Carano moved over to the movie world, most notably starring in films like Fast & Furious 6 and Deadpool. Rousey likewise tried her hand at acting and became a WWE superstar, where she had a pair of reigns as champion before leaving the promotion in 2023. \n\"Ronda came to me and said there is only one person she would make a comeback for and it has been her dream to make this fight happen between us,\" Carano said in a press release. \"She thanked me for opening up doors for her in her career and was respectful in asking for this fight to happen. This is an honor. I believe I will walk out of this fight with the win and I anticipate it will not come easy, which I welcome. This is as much for Ronda and me as it is for the fans and mixed martial arts community. What a time to be alive.\"During a recent book tour, Rousey opened up about suffering concussions as a child and questioned if she'd ever fight again due to the effects from those head injuries. \nTheir MMA careers never overlapped, but the pair were, for a time, the two biggest crossover stars in women's combat sports and now will meet for the first time in the cage. Given it's been a decade since Rousey has fought and 17 years since Carano last fought, one would expect some rust, but they'll be given the full championship distance to shake that off and try to recapture the magic that made them stars inside the cage. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Kenneth Walker III knew his impending free agency would be a topic ahead of Super Bowl LX, but the Seahawks running back kept his eyes on the game and the Patriots' stout run defense.\"I really just want to focus on practicing, getting ready for the game,\" Walker said during the week leading up to the Super Bowl, per The Athletic. \"After that, we'll see what happens.\"But he also ventured into the \"after that\" part.\"I've been here four years, so you know I've gotten to know a lot of stuff about Seattle, and you know a lot of the city, and I feel like they feel good about me as well,\" he said, per NFL Media. \"If it was my choice, though, I'd definitely stay.\"Then the Super Bowl came, and Walker flourished: 161 yards from scrimmage en route to becoming the first Super Bowl MVP running back in the 21st century.\nIt was part of a stellar postseason for Walker. With Zach Charbonnet sidelined by a torn ACL, Walker racked up 417 yards from scrimmage across three games. His 139 scrimmage yards per game were the second-most by a Super Bowl-winning running back this century, trailing only Saquon Barkley's 143.5 mark from last season. Walker also scored four touchdowns in the postseason after totaling just five in the regular season.Walker showed off his immense talents: tackle avoidance, patience, explosiveness, strength and creativity. He was a big-play threat as both a runner and receiver, and he handled 22-plus touches in all three games after his regular-season high was 20. During the regular season, Walker finished seventh in explosive rush rate (min. 100 carries) and second to Bijan Robinson in tackle-avoidance rate.\nA career year in a contract year is never a bad thing. There are plenty of winners from the Seahawks' championship run, but Walker -- given his production, age (25) and free agency status -- might be the biggest. Here's where he could end up next.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. SeahawksWalker said he'd \"definitely stay\" if Seattle wants him back, and coach Mike Macdonald added, \"Of course, we want Ken back.\"It takes more than words to make it happen, and according to ESPN, the Seahawks do not plan to use the franchise or transition tag on Walker. That means he will hit free agency. Still, Seattle should be the favorite for Walker's services. According to CBS Sports research, only three Super Bowl MVPs have played for a different team the following year: Dexter Jackson (2003), Desmond Howard (1997) and Larry Brown (1996). It's been a long time.\nAdd in Charbonnet's recovery from a late-season knee injury, and Seattle has a clear need at the position. Keeping a Super Bowl hero just entering his prime makes sense.\n        \n            \n                Prophecies, pressure and a Lombardi Trophy: Inside the Seahawks' Super Bowl run\n                \n                    Jonathan Jones                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. JaguarsThe Jaguars have an impending free agent running back coming off a breakout as well in Travis Etienne Jr. Should he not return to Jacksonville, Walker could emerge as a suitable replacement. The Jaguars jumped to 13-4 this season, their first under Liam Coen, who loves using multiple backs. He did so in Jacksonville in 2025 and previously in Tampa Bay.Walker would add serious explosiveness to the attack. He ranked seventh in explosive rush rate among 52 players with at least 100 carries this season; Etienne ranked 41st. Rookie Bhayshul Tuten didn't have enough carries to qualify, but if he had, he would have ranked 49th.\nWalker doesn't have to be a terrific pass catcher or blocker. Tuten can handle the former, and fellow 2025 rookie LeQuint Allen can handle the latter. It could be a strong match between a creative play caller and a talented running back.There are connections, too: Chad Morton was the Seahawks' running backs coach when Seattle selected Walker and now holds the same role in Jacksonville. Shane Waldron was Seattle's offensive coordinator at the time as well and is now the Jaguars' pass game coordinator.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. JetsThe Jets also fall into the category of lead running back potentially going elsewhere. Breece Hall is a free agent. Selected five picks before Walker in the 2022 NFL Draft, Hall has been less explosive but significantly more consistent down to down.\nThe Jets' offense was dismal in 2025, but with a new offensive coordinator in Frank Reich, a new quarterback almost certainly coming to town, a solid young offensive line and some of the deepest pockets in free agency, New York could be a fit.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. PanthersAfter emerging as one of the best free-agent signings midway through last season, Rico Dowdle saw his usage dwindle late in the year and said the role reduction would impact his free agency decision. If Dowdle leaves, the Panthers would be left with Chuba Hubbard, who posted a league-worst 0.7% explosive rushing rate last year. Hubbard is a much better player than the number suggests -- he had a 9.6% explosive rush rate in 2024 -- but the offense badly needs juice.Last year, Carolina ranked 28th in explosive play rate. Bryce Young isn't the type of player to rip off big gains through the air consistently, and if Hubbard's down 2025 is a sign of things to come, Carolina needs another playmaker. The Panthers graded as the NFL's fourth-best run-blocking unit, per Pro Football Focus, and placing Walker in that environment could produce exciting results.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. ChiefsIt's hard not to include the Chiefs on any list involving running backs. For the second straight season, Kansas City's backs posted the least explosive rushing rate in the NFL. A lot of good run blocking is going to waste. Kareem Hunt and Isiah Pacheco are both free agents, and Patrick Mahomes is coming off a torn ACL. The Chiefs need more explosiveness. Though they must move money around this offseason, they'd be wise to at least throw their hat in the ring.Other potential suitorsThe Vikings bear mentioning. Minnesota has Aaron Jones and Jordan Mason, but Jones is 31 and coming off the lowest yards per carry (4.2) of his career. A runner of Walker's caliber would help J.J. McCarthy and Kevin O'Connell. Minnesota, like Kansas City, is in a tough financial spot.Perhaps the Texans are a sleeper team. Houston's running backs ranked 27th in explosive rush rate in 2025, and Joe Mixon's football future is uncertain due to a \"freak\" medical condition. Woody Marks had a nice rookie year, but adding Walker would provide much-needed playmaking.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Tanking was a hot topic at All-Star Weekend. Everyone seemed to have an opinion. Reggie Miller, holding court at the Intuit Dome on Saturday, told a group of international media members that he's against the practice because it runs counter to the competitive spirit of the game. Miller warned against angering the Basketball Gods and said tanking \"never works.\"Really? It never works? Here at Tank Watch, we'd counter that there are plenty of examples of the strategy yielding results. You only have to go back to last season when the Sixers scrapped their postseason aspirations, shut down Joel Embiid, Paul George and Tyrese Maxey, and finished out the campaign with 29 losses in their final 33 games. They got a little lucky in the lottery (which, it could be argued, was the Basketball Gods looking favorably upon their approach) and ultimately ended up with the third overall pick and VJ Edgecombe. The early returns on that young backcourt pairing are overwhelmingly positive. Considering the Sixers have a winning record and Edgecombe has been a key contributor, I asked Maxey whether the short-term pain of tanking last season was ultimately a price worth paying to improve the team this season and for the future. He said last season was \"definitely rough to go through\" for him personally but added \"this year we've done a really good job of turning things around.\"\"Like you said,\" Maxey continued, \"the outcome was VJ Edgecombe, who is like a little brother to me now, you know what I mean? He's great, man. Not just basketball-wise, but for our team personality-wise and culture-wise for our organization and things that we're trying to turn around.\"\nSounded like an all's well that ends well situation to me, but the league clearly doesn't see it that way. The very first question Commissioner Adam Silver fielded at his annual All-Star press conference was about tanking. He acknowledged that \"it's been part of the league for a long time\" but said we're seeing \"behavior that is worse this year than we've seen in recent memory.\" As a result, the league is looking at various ways to discourage the practice. Silver said all options are on the table, including potentially taking away draft picks. None of this is surprising. Silver has long preached parity. But the league is already pretty close to achieving a best-case scenario on that front. There are eight tanking teams this season and one more that ought to be doing so (we'll get to whatever it is the Bucks think they're doing a little later). That still leaves more than two-thirds of the NBA that is actually trying to win. That's plenty of teams to field a competitive product. Meanwhile, the teams at the bottom are using the means at their disposal to get better. All this hand wringing and pearl clutching and please won't someone think of the children hysteria feels like more of an optics issue than a practical concern. But then that would be our position at Tank Watch.  ◦ Note:  Teams are rated based on who's doing the best job of being bad in a given week. Teams that lose and find innovative ways to get around the league's player participation policy will rise in the rankings. Teams that accidentally win a game they wish they would have lost will fall. \nNBA Tank Rankings -- Feb. 17\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Sacramento Kings (12-44) Change: --This season's undisputed tanking champions. The Kings got throttled in Utah in their final game before the break, losing to the Jazz by 28. It was their 14th loss in a row. That's the most consecutive defeats for the organization since the 1970s when they were the Cincinnati Royals. Zach LaVine was recently shut down and is expected to miss the rest of the season after undergoing hand surgery. (There's a case to be made that letting him play would actually be better for tanking purposes, but get well soon, Zach.) Domantas Sabonis, Keegan Murray, Russell Westbrook, De'Andre Hunter and Malik Monk all went into the All-Star break on the injury report. In their place, Nique Clifford, Dylan Cardwell and Daeqwon Plowden are getting a lot of run. In that loss to the Jazz, Clifford went 1 for 15 from the floor in 38 minutes. Cardwell and Plowden played a combined 60 minutes and went 5 for 17 from the field. You know the saying about how franchises decide to tank but players actually try? These guys were trying! \nIncredible work. The Kings have found their calling. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. Utah Jazz (18-38)Change: ↑2Up two spots in an acknowledgement of both innovation in the tanking space and chutzpah. When you get fined $500,000 for your antics, you know you've touched a nerve.\nThe Jazz had been pulling what Tank Watch considered a pretty crafty maneuver. They started Lauri Markkanen, Jusuf Nurkic and Jaren Jackson Jr in several games before sitting them in the fourth quarter. (JJJ has since been shut down for the season with a knee injury.) That seemed like a clever workaround to the NBA's player participation policy. The Jazz were playing their starters. Surely, the league couldn't dictate how much Utah had to play them. As it turns out, that's exactly the position the league has now adopted (and don't call me surely).As the commissioner noted in his All-Star press conference, by fining the Jazz (and Pacers) in this manner, the league has gotten itself into a gray area. Levying punishment of this sort has a decidedly subjective you know it when you see it quality. That's not a long-term solution.\nWere the fines just a warning shot? Will they continue? Will the price point go up? Something to monitor, but it feels like the league has backed itself into a corner here.As for Utah, the worst part about this -- as Jazz governor Ryan Smith pointed out -- was accidentally winning that game against the Heat. Hang in there, Jazz fans. You guys will (hopefully not) get them next time.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Washington Wizards (14-39)Change: --Now with the worst record in the Eastern Conference. (Put that on a billboard outside the arena). Losers of three in a row going into the break and 14 of their last 18. \nTrae Young and Anthony Davis have yet to play for the Wizards and remain unlikely to do so despite what general manager Will Dawkins said about leaving open the possibility. Alex Sarr is out at least two weeks with a hamstring. This thing is on autopilot.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Dallas Mavericks (19-35)Change: ↑1Now we're getting somewhere. After an ill-advised four-game win streak in late January, the Mavs have lost nine in a row. In their penultimate game before the break, they were hanging a little too tight with a Suns team that was without Grayson Allen and Jalen Green. These are the tests that the best tankers figure out how to solve. Cooper Flagg played 36 minutes, took 20 shots and scored 27 points. He's exempt here. Naji Marshall had 31 extremely efficient points in 36 minutes off the bench. That would have been troublesome if not for the rest of the Mavs bottoming out. Eight other guys played at least 11 minutes and did exactly nothing remarkable. That included poor Khris Middleton playing 22 minutes, getting hunted on defense, and being so ineffective that the TV broadcast called him out. I'm paraphrasing, but they basically hit him with a version of \"he's too old for this [stuff].\"\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Indiana Pacers (15-40)Change: ↓3Unlike the Jazz, who tried to thread the player participation policy needle, the Pacers opted for the more traditional strategy of just sitting a bunch of guys in their game against Utah, including All-Star Pascal Siakam. That was a much easier move for the league to flag, hence the $100,000 fine. The discipline matters a lot less than Indiana winning two in a row going into the break, allowing the Wizards to drop below them in the standings. Indiana beat the Knicks and the Nets on the road. \"New York nightlife is undefeated\" is a saying in the NBA for a reason. Next time the Pacers are in NYC, they need to hit the town and come down with a bad case of the Big Apple flu. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Chicago Bulls (24-31)Change: --Losers of six in a row and nine of their last 10. That includes losses to the Nets, Pacers and Bucks. Over that period, the Bulls are 28th in offensive rating and 29th in defensive rating. \nJosh Giddey, Tre Jones and Jalen Smith all went into the break on the injury report. The minutes distribution for the Island of Misfit Toys that's been assembled in Chicago has been something to behold. In a 19-point loss to the Celtics (which could have been a much bigger margin considering Boston was up by as much as 33), the Bulls started Guershon Yabusele, Patrick Williams, Matas Buzelis, Colin Sexton and Anfernee Simons. Nick Richards played 29 minutes off the bench. Jaden Ivey and Rob Dillingham played a combined 59 minutes as reserves.Total slop from the Bulls. Full marks. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Memphis Grizzlies (20-33)Change: --The Grizzlies have dropped four in a row and 10 of their last 12. They've gotten into a nice rhythm, though it will be tough for them to sink lower in the standings. Even with the recent losing streak, they're still a game and a half up on the Mavericks. One of the wins was over the Wolves on a night when Anthony Edwards had 39 points. Memphis still had JJJ at that point so that one can be excused. Ditto the other victory, which was over the Kings in Sacramento. Tough to beat the Tank Gods at their own game. To change up Ric Flair's old saying, to be the worst you have to lose to the worst. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    8. Brooklyn Nets (15-38)Change: --The Nets lost their last game going into the break -- and what a loss it was. I was getting ready to crush Brooklyn for not having its priorities straight. The Nets had previously beaten fellow tankers Washington and Chicago in back-to-back games. A third straight victory would have drawn considerable ire from Tank Watch.Instead, the Nets lost to the Pacers at home. That took some effort (or lack of same). The Pacers did not play Siakam, Andrew Nembhard, Aaron Nesmith or TJ McConnell. Indiana went with a starting lineup of Jarace Walker, Jay Huff, Kobe Brown, Ben Sheppard and Kam Jones. The Pacers definitely understood the assignment that night. So did the Nets.Even without Michael Porter Jr and Noah Clowney, the Nets were up by 18 -- and Brooklyn still managed to lose by five. [Raises a fist of tanking solidarity.] \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    9. Milwaukee Bucks (23-30)Change: --What exactly do the Bucks think they're doing? They've won five of their last six. This is not a good team, and yet two of those wins were over the Hospital Thunder (they're dealing with several injuries) and the Magic. Newly acquired gunner Cam Thomas had 34 points in 25 minutes off the bench in the victory over Orlando. I tend to believe that he'll shoot them out of more games than he'll win for them, but chuckers are unpredictable and the variance is wide. Are the Bucks trying to make the play-in and get bounced from the first round for the fourth straight season? Or would they prefer a higher pick in the upcoming draft (they have whichever pick is worse between their own and New Orleans, which still figures to be pretty good going into the lottery)? Whether Giannis stays or doesn't, the latter option seems preferable. The Bucks are on notice. They're dangerously close to being exiled from Tank Watch. Tank Wars Game(s) of the WeekPacers at Wizards, Thursday and Friday, 7 p.m. ETBack-to-back tank battles to restart the remainder of the season. Who wants it less?Jazz at Grizzlies, Friday, 7 p.m. ETThe Jazz should play their starters a single minute in the fourth quarter. Let's see how petty they can get. Tankathon Spin of the Week\n                                                                    Tankathon\n                                                            The Grizzlies have 13 first-round picks in the next seven drafts. This would be a hell of a start to that run. \n            ",

    "body": "\nThere is little to suggest that Paris Saint-Germain are past their glory days – the group that became the first French team to win a treble, led by coach Luis Enrique, are all still in place, even if injuries have hampered their ambitions at times this season. Yet, the reigning European champions return to the UEFA Champions League in the midst of an undeniable skid, pressure mourning on them to change things up as the business end of the season begins.PSG have just four wins in their last eight, a skid that started with a surprise 1-0 defeat to Paris FC in the round of 32 in the Coupe de France. Since, they failed to land inside the Champions League's top eight at the end of the league phase and slipped down to second place in Ligue 1 following Friday's defeat to Rennes. Rough patches like these are few and far between for a team like PSG, who usually cruise through domestic competitions, making the answers to their questions hard to find.After Friday's loss, Ballon d'Or winner Ousmane Dembele took a stab at identifying the problem – a lack of unity that brought them together a year ago, one that was easy to spot in the absence of Kylian Mbappe after his high-profile move to Real Madrid the summer before.How to watch Monaco vs. Paris Saint-Germain, oddsDate: Tuesday, Feb. 16 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Stade Louis II -- MonacoLive stream: Paramount+Odds: Monaco +550; Draw +380; Paris Saint-Germain -230\"I think we need to show more desire,\" Dembele told broadcasters on Friday. \"Because if we play as individuals on the pitch it won't work, we won't win the trophies we want. Last season, we put the club first before thinking about ourselves. I think we need to rediscover that. We're in the second half of the season and Paris Saint-Germain should come first, not individual players.\"Enrique played down Dembele's discontent.\"The players' statements after the match are worthless,\" he said. \"Absolutely worthless. Neither are the coaches' statements, but the players' statements are worthless. I'm not going to answer any question from a player, any response from a player. I will never allow any player to be above the club. So, it's clear. I am the person responsible for the team. I will not allow any player to think that he is more important than the club. Neither me, nor the sporting director, nor the president, nor the club. So, these statements are worthless. They are the result of anger after a match, and I think that's clear. We have nothing to lose.\"Enrique is arguably right to dispel signs of trouble since PSG, from a statistical standpoint, have not strayed all that far from course. They have held steady defensively over the last eight matches and remain on par with their season-long average of one goal against per game across all competitions. That, though, has not stopped Enrique from making a goalkeeping change midway through the season. Matvey Safonov, Gianluigi Donnarumm's back-up through last season's treble-winning campaign, has started the team's last four games, taking up the role despite Enrique's bold decision to ditch Donnarumma for ex-Lille goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier. Chevalier, though, had looked out of his depth at times to start his career with PSG and has not played a minute since January 23. If anything, the discrepancy is in their attacking output but not in the way one might expect — they averaged 2.4 expected goals per match in their last eight, above their season average of 2.1, but have underperformed in that category considerably by only scoring 1.8 goals per game. That trend was clearly on display against Rennes on Friday — PSG outshot the opponent 22 to 13 while generating 3.58 expected goals to Rennes' 1.38, only to lose 3-1.The high-intensity style that made them Europe's most indomitable team a year ago, allowing them to overwhelm the opposition from the opening whistle, is less of a feature this season. PSG seem a step behind that pace, the demands of soccer's non-stop calendar perhaps finally catching up to them. They were amongst 12 European teams to take part in last summer's Club World Cup and made their way to the final before crumbling in a 3-0 defeat to Chelsea, making for an unforgiving schedule. They beat Inter in the Champions League final in Munich on May 31 and were back in action on June 15 for their Club World Cup opener against Atletico Madrid in Pasadena, California. They were in the New York City suburbs on July 13 for the final, only to resume play exactly a month later in Udine, Italy for the UEFA Super Cup against Tottenham Hotspur.On an individual basis, players seem to be dealing with the impact. Dembele may have 13 goals and eight assists this season but he is behind the pace of his Ballon d'Or-winning campaign that saw him notch 33 goals, instead saddled with injuries over the last few months. His exact availability against Monaco is unclear — he trained on Monday but has reportedly complained about discomfort in one of his legs.Understaffed or otherwise, PSG's trip to a middling Monaco side offers the perfect opportunity for the European champions to reverse course — but only they can snap themselves out of the funk they are currently in.\n            ",

Houston had the opportunity to show the country that it deserves to be on the No. 1 line during the NCAA Tournament Selection Committee's bracket preview, which airs Saturday on CBS at 12:30 p.m. ET.

If the NET was the selection committee's top seeding tool, then perhaps you'd be right.But it's not. When it comes to deciding who belongs on the No. 1 seed line, the committee is more likely to use a \"resume\" metric such as Wins Above Bubble (WAB) as a guide than it is to lean on a \"predictive\" metric like NET, which incorporates victory margin and efficiency metrics.UConn's resume makes it deserving of a No. 1 seed. The Huskies own wins over Illinois, Kansas and Florida and are holding steady at No. 3 in WAB amid a 14-1 start to Big East play. The Huskies rank behind only Michigan and Duke in WAB, and they are also highly regarded in KPI (5th) and Strength of Record (3rd), which are the other resume-based metrics on official NCAA team sheets.This creates a clear distinction between the Huskies and a strong group of teams on their heels that is headlined by Houston, Purdue and Iowa State.\nPurdue vs. Michigan stakesTuesday night's showdown between No. 1 Michigan and No. 7 Purdue is banger of a Big Ten battle that will require the nation's top-ranked team to navigate a hostile environment. It's also a likely must-win if Purdue hopes to eventually reach No. 1 seed status. The Boilermakers' schedule down the stretch is relatively light, meaning this is their best opportunity to add some heft to their resume. If the Wolverines lose, the initial projection from the CBS Sports Bracketology model is that they would remain the No. 1 overall seed. Regardless, we have Saturday's game between Duke and Michigan to anticipate as a showdown that will also impact the picture on the No. 1 seed line.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Dallas Cowboys have one of the best kicking weapons in the NFL in Brandon Aubrey, but if they're not careful, they could end up losing him this offseason. Aubrey is set to be a restricted free agent, which means the Cowboys will have almost every chance to hold on to him, but that doesn't necessarily mean that's going to happen. If the Cowboys reach a long-term deal with Aubrey before free agency starts on March 11, then they'll keep him, but if that doesn't happen, then things could get interesting. If the two sides don't agree to a new deal, the Cowboys would have to place a one-year restricted free agent tender on Aubrey. For the 2026 offseason, here are the three tender options (contract estimates via Overthecap): First-round tender ($8.02 million)Second-round tender ($5.81 million)Right-of-refusal tender ($3.55 million)If the Cowboys were to use any of these three tenders on Aubrey, that means another team could come in and make an offer. If a team does make an offer, the Cowboys have the right to match it. \nIf the Cowboys used a first-round tender on Aubrey and he ends up signing with another team, then his new team would have to give Dallas a first-round pick as compensation. However, if Aubrey didn't get any offers, he'd make $8.02 million on one-year deal with the Cowboys in 2026 as part of the first-round tender. In that situation, he'd become the highest-paid kicker in NFL history by far (The current title belongs to Harrison Butker, who makes $6.4 million per year with the Chiefs). With the second-round tender, if Aubrey leaves for another team, then Dallas will get a second-round pick in return. With the right-of-refusal tender, the Cowboys would get zero compensation if Aubrey signs with another team. In all three instances, the Cowboys would get a chance to match any offer that's made to Aubrey, so they do hold some serious leverage here. Once again, the Cowboys could avoid this entire situation by getting a long-term deal done by March 11, but if that doesn't happen, then the 31 other teams will be free to call him and make an offer (The Cowboys could also hit Aubrey with the franchise tag at a cost of $6.9 million, but then they wouldn't be able to use the tag on any other player, so that seems unlikely). \nAubrey, who holds the NFL record for most field goals of 60 yards or more, is the ultimate kicking weapon and he's one of the few kickers in the NFL who would be worth almost any price you have to pay to get him, including a possible first-round pick. With that in mind, let's take a look at a four teams who should try to steal Aubrey from the Cowboys. One note here, there are plenty of teams that need a kicker, but we're going to stick with mostly indoor teams on our list, because Aubrey seems to thrive indoors. According to Pro Football Reference, he's hit 93.8% of his field goal attempts while playing indoors in his career (dome or retractable roof), but just 78.3% while playing outdoors. No, that's not a great percentage for outdoor kicks, but one of those misses came from 70. Basically, Aubrey is asked to do things that almost no other kicker in the league is asked to do, which hurts his accuracy rate. \nThis man is a weapon, so let's check out who should pay up to get him. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Los Angeles RamsThe Rams had one of the worst special teams units in the NFL last season and a big reason for that is because they struggled in the kicking department. Joshua Karty started the season as the kicker, but after hitting just 66.7% of his field goals through eight games, the Rams decided to move on. Harrison Mevis took over after that and went 12 of 13 to close out the season, which was solid, but he was never really tested from long range. He only attempted two kicks from outside 45 yards and he went 1 of 2 (50%). Since taking over the Rams' coaching job in 2017, Sean McVay has never had a true long-range kicker like Aubrey. During his three years in Dallas, Aubrey has hit seven field goals from 59 yards or longer, which is a huge number when you consider that the Rams have had ZERO field goals of 59 yards or longer during McVay's nine seasons with the team. In 2025, the Rams were one of just three teams that didn't have a single field goal longer than 52 yards. Aubrey, who has a career long of 65 yards, is the only kicker in NFL history with three field goals of 63 yards or longer. With NFL teams getting the ball at the 35 on a touchback thanks to the new kickoff rules, the Rams would need just 15 yards to essentially be in Aubrey's range. \nBack in Week 2, the Cowboys were in that exact situation. After the Giants scored a touchdown to take a 37-34 lead on Dallas with just 25 seconds left to play, it looked like the Cowboys were going to lose, but they didn't, because they have Aubrey. After the ensuing kickoff, the Cowboys drove just 21 yards, which put Aubrey in range for a 64-yard field goal that sent the game to overtime. \nAubrey then won the game in overtime with a 46-yard kick. As crazy as it sounds, four of the Rams' five regular-season losses might have gone differently in 2025 with Aubrey on their team. Week 3: Eagles 33-26 over Rams. The Rams lost this game because Philly blocked two L.A. field goals, including one that the Eagles returned for a touchdown. Aubrey gets a lot of height on his kicks and NONE of his field goal attempts were blocked in 2025, so the Rams likely win this game with Aubrey. Week 5: 49ers 26-23 over Rams. Karty missed a 53-yard field goal in the second half of this game and that's exactly kind of kick that you bring in Aubrey for. Maybe the Rams still don't win if that kick goes through -- because it would have only meant a tie game -- but it certainly would have made things more interesting. Week 16: Seahawks 38-37 over Rams. Mevis missed a 48-yard field goal in the fourth quarter, which definitely hurt. Also, the Rams had a first-and-10 at their own 49-yard line in the final minute of regulation. With Aubrey on your team, you only need a few yards to get in field goal range and the Rams likely would have had called plays differently to reflect that. Instead, Matthew Stafford threw three straight incompletions and the Rams punted in an eventual loss. Week 17: Falcons 27-24 over Rams. The Rams got the ball at their own 35-yard line with just 21 seconds left and no timeouts. Stafford shot for the sideline on four straight throws, but came up empty each time. With Aubrey on the team, the Rams could've taken a shot over the middle as long as it got them to at least the 50. At that point, they could have spiked it and at least given Aubrey a chance from long range. There are only two or three kickers who would have a realistic chance from 68 and Aubrey is one of them. Rams general manager Les Snead invented the \"F them picks\" philosophy and nothing would go along with that more than giving up a second- or first-round pick for Aubrey. That's right, I said first-round pick. If the Cowboys put a first-round tender on him, I still think this move would make sense for the Rams. They have two first-round picks and giving one up for the ultimate kicking weapon would be the ultimate \"F them picks\" move. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Atlanta FalconsThere is no team that had a bigger kicking nightmare in 2025 than the Atlanta Falcons. They finished tied for first place in the NFC South with an 8-9 record and they probably would have made the playoffs if they had a better kicker. Let's take a look at all the times that a missed kick cost them a win last season: Week 1: Buccaneers 23-20 over Falcons. The Falcons lost their opener after Younghoe Koo missed a 44-yard field goal with just two seconds left. The Falcons decided to move on from Koo after the miss. He went 2 of 3 in the game against Tampa Bay, but after hitting just 73.5% of his field goals in 2024, the Falcons had lost confidence in him. Week 9: Patriots 24-23 over Falcons. The Falcons went on the road and had a chance to tie the game up in the fourth quarter after scoring a touchdown with under five minutes left to play, but John Parker Romo missed the extra point. If he had made the kick, it would have tied things up at 24 and the Falcons might have beaten the eventual AFC champions. Week 13: Jets 27-24 over Falcons. In this game, Zane Gonzalez missed a 50-yard field goal in the second half, which definitely hurt considering the Falcons ended up losing by three. That's three games that could have gone a different way with better kicking, and as you may or may have not noticed the three kicks above were all missed by different kickers, which means that yup, the Falcons used THREE DIFFERENT KICKERS last season. With Aubrey on the team, the Falcons probably win at least one of those games and with one extra win, they would have won the NFC South. Over the past three seasons, the Falcons have only hit ONE field goal of more than 56 yards. In that same span, Aubrey has hit 13. With a new head coach in place, the Falcons are starting over this season and starting over at kicker by adding Aubrey would be a smart move. \nFalcons fans have spent the past few months trying will this move into existence and now, Atlanta will have a chance to make it happen. Getting Aubrey would certainly be a bold move for Matt Ryan, who is in his first-year as the lead decision-maker in the Falcons' front office. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New York GiantsThere's no coach in the NFL who takes kicking more seriously than John Harbaugh. During his time in Baltimore, the former Ravens coach had Justin Tucker, who was arguably the best kicker in NFL history during his prime years. After moving on from Tucker, the Ravens drafted Tyler Loop, who had a solid rookie season before missing a potential game-winning field goal in Week 18 that would have sent Baltimore to the playoffs. \nIn a twist of irony, the coach who prides himself on finding kickers lost his job because of a kicker. \nNow that he's in New York, you can bet that Harbaugh will look to fix the kicking position. The Giants used four kickers (and one punter) in 2025 and those kickers combined to hit an NFL-worst 87.8% of their extra points. Those kickers also combined to hit just 57.1% of their kicks from 40 yards or longer. Dating to the start of the 2024 season, the Giants haven't hit a single field goal longer than 55 yards. The Giants do have Graham Gano under contract, but he's going to be 39 years old and he's missed 28 games over the past three seasons, so it won't be surprising if Harbaugh decides to bring a kicker in and if he wants to shock the rest of the league, that kicker will be Aubrey. It's a move that would be win-win because it would help the Giants and make a division rival worse off at a key position. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Arizona CardinalsChad Ryland was the Cardinals' kicker last season and he hit just 75.2% of his field goal attempts, which was the lowest percentage for any kicker with 25 attempts or more. Ryland hit just 58.8% of his kicks from 43 yards and longer, including 1 of 4 from outside 57 yards. As bad as the Cardinals (3-14) were last season, this is a team that lost seven games by seven points or less. Ryland missed at least one field goal in three different games that the Cardinals lost by three points or less. \nIf the Cowboys use a second-round tender on Aubrey, the Cardinals would have to give up the 34th overall pick in the draft to get him, which might be too expensive for this roster. Getting Aubrey only makes sense if you think it might put you over the top or in the Giants' case, if you have a head coach who's obsessed with having the best kicker in football. For the Cardinals, this cost might be too high, but the argument for it is that it's not every day you have a chance to land a weapon like Aubrey, so why not do whatever possible to make it happen. Using a first- or second-round pick to steal Aubrey might seem crazy, but he's certainly worth it, especially since the NFL is in an era where almost every game seems to be close. In 2025, there were a total of 73 regular-season games decided by three points or less, which was tied for the most in NFL history. Every NFL team should be trying to get an edge wherever it can to help it win close games and when you have a kicker like Aubrey, that gives you an edge over everyone else. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Tony Clark, executive director of the MLB Players Association, is expected to resign, The Athletic reported Tuesday. The stunning news comes just months before the current collective bargaining agreement is set to expire on Dec. 1.\"You definitely don't want things to be a distraction going into December,\" Marcus Semien, a member of the MLBPA's executive subcommittee, told reporters, including the New York Post, on Tuesday, adding Clark did not discuss his resignation with union leadership ahead of time. \"So that's all I can really say. Maybe (that is) why this is happening now.\"  Clark and the MLBPA are under federal investigation by the Eastern District of New York. Prosecutors are looking into whether a licensing company co-founded by the MLBPA and the NFL players union, OneTeam Partners, was being used to financially enrich the union leaders. The full scope of the investigation into the company is unclear.An MLBPA-owned youth baseball company, Players Way, is also under investigation for alleged financial impropriety. The company is said to have held few live events for kids even though the MLBPA put $3.9 million into the company. Players Way executives and consultants reportedly received six-figure salaries despite the company's lack of events.\n\n        \n            \n                Six major issues for Tony Clark's MLBPA replacement: Salary cap, international draft, more negotiating tasks\n                \n                    Mike Axisa                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"I think so,\" Semien added when asked whether Clark is resigning due to the investigations. \"Because up to this point, before any investigations, I've had the ultimate confidence in Tony Clark to lead this player group. I've had the ultimate confidence in Bruce Meyer to be the lead negotiator for this player group.\"Three former members of the MLBPA's executive subcommittee -- Jack Flaherty, Lucas Giolito, and Ian Happ -- attempted to remove Meyer as the union's deputy director in December 2024. Flaherty, Giolito, and Happ were then voted out of the subcommittee. There are eight players on the subcommittee: Semien, Chris Bassitt, Jake Cronenworth, Pete Fairbanks, Cedric Mullins, Paul Skenes, Tarik Skubal, and Brent Suter.   CBA negotiations typically begin during the spring and get serious in April and throughout the summer. Clark's expected resignation comes at a precarious time for MLB, as the upcoming labor negotiations are expected to get ugly. Both sides, in fact, have warned of the likelihood of a labor stoppage, though each blames the other, of course. \n\"In a bizarre way, it's actually a positive,\" commissioner Rob Manfred said last year of a lockout. \"There is leverage associated with an offseason lockout and the process of collective bargaining under the (National Labor Relations Act) works based on leverage. The great thing about offseason lockouts is the leverage that exists gets applied between the bargaining parties.\"The salary cap -- proposed by the owners -- is again the biggest sticking point, as the league presents the idea of teamwide payroll minimums and maximums under the guise of parity. The union has always held that it will never accept a salary cap. Other issues expected to come up for debate include playoff expansion and an international draft.Clark, 53, joined the MLBPA in 2010 following a 15-year playing career. He was unanimously approved as the union's executive director in December 2013, following the death of Michael Weiner. Clark has overseen the last two CBA negotiations.\nIt's unclear who will take over Clark's role in the players' union, but subcommittee member Brent Suter told The Athletic that the MLBPA will use an interim leader, citing the desire to \"keep everything as stable as we can this year.\" Clark was scheduled to begin his annual spring training tour Tuesday, though his meeting with the Cleveland Guardians has reportedly been canceled already.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        With the collective bargaining agreement set to expire on Dec. 1, the MLB Players Association is suddenly looking for a new executive director. Tony Clark, the union's leader since 2013, will reportedly resign amid federal investigations into financial impropriety. Clark and the MLBPA are being investigated over licensing money and also a youth baseball initiative.\"I think so,\" Marcus Semien, a member of the MLBPA's executive subcommitee, said when asked whether Clark is resigning due to the investigations.  \"Because up to this point, before any investigations, I've had the  ultimate confidence in Tony Clark to lead this player group.

CBA negotiations typically begin in the spring and really heat up around Opening Day. It is unclear who could replace Clark, though the union will want a new executive director in place soon. Clark's replacement must of course be voted on and approved by the players. Subcommittee member Brent Suter told The Athletic that there will be an interim leader to \"keep everything as stable as we can this year.\"The timing of Clark's resignation is definitely not great. CBA negotiations are always contentious and that will again be the case come December. The 2022-23 lockout lasted a record 99 days and commissioner Rob Manfred has made it pretty clear another lockout is coming. \"In a bizarre way, it's actually a positive,\" Manfred said last year about a lockout.\nClark, 53, joined the union in 2010 and was unanimously approved as executive director following Michael Weiner's death in December 2013. He oversaw two CBA negotiations and had three years to prepare for his first negotiation in 2016. His replacement will not have that luxury. The next executive director will jump right into CBA talks.Here are six major issues Clark's eventual replacement will have to tackle once CBA talks begin with MLB.Salary capLong story short, CBA negotiations are about money. Everything else is secondary. There is a giant pile of money and the two sides haggle because they each want a bigger piece. MLB has done a good job selling a salary cap as necessary to improve competitive balance, but make no mistake, it is about money. Above all, a salary cap restricts player salaries and boosts franchise values.\nMLB has pursued a salary cap since the 1880s. They seek one every CBA negotiation. The question this time is how dug in are the 30 owners? They could see Clark's abrupt resignation as a moment of weakness for the union, and push harder for a salary cap than ever. (Remember, very few current owners were around to experience how much the 1994-95 strike damaged the game.)The union has resisted a salary cap -- MLB is the only non-capped league in North America -- and figures to do so again this CBA negotiation. It is easy to be a doomer about these things and expect games to be missed in 2027, and maybe they will be, but it is way too early to say that for certain. MLB's national television deals are up in 2028. Losing games would be terrible for business.Also, a salary cap is not a simple yes or no item. Even if the MLBPA relents and agrees to a salary cap, the two sides have to agree on how the whole thing would work. What counts as baseball-related revenue and what percentage do the players receive? What's the cap? What's the floor? How do you implement it? The yes/no is the easy part. Figuring out the system is the real fight.\nRevenue sharingWith or without a salary cap, the revenue sharing system is likely to be adjusted in the next CBA. Currently, every team puts 48% of its local revenue (local television deal, tickets, concessions, etc.) into the pot, then each team takes out an equal 1/30th share. Big-market teams pay more into revenue sharing than they take out. Small-market teams take out more than they pay in.Baseball has always had a revenue disparity problem but it has never been this extreme. Between payroll and competitive balance tax, the Dodgers fielded a $516 million roster in 2025, or more than the bottom five payroll teams combined. Adjusting the revenue sharing program will pit the owners against each other. After that, they have to take it to the MLBPA and get the union's approval too.ArbitrationMLB has sought to eliminate the arbitration process and replace it with a pay-for-play formula, where player salary is determined strictly by their performance. Tarik Skubal's recent record $32 million arbitration win is likely to ramp up those efforts. Arbitration is a key item for the MLBPA. They're against anything that takes away a player's ability to negotiate his salary. They'll fight to keep arbitration.\nPostseason expansionThe postseason only grows larger -- it never shrinks -- and playoff expansion has really ramped up in recent years. Here are how many teams qualified for the postseason throughout baseball history (ignoring the 2020 pandemic season):1903-68: 2 teams (World Series only)1969-93: 4 teams (Championship Series added)1994-2011: 8 teams (Division Series added)2012-21: 10 teams (Wild Card Game added)2022-present: 12 teams (Wild Card Series added)MLB pushed for a 14-team postseason field during the last CBA negotiation and the MLBPA held the line at 12 teams. That gives the union a negotiating chip this time around. The players want playoff expansion too. It means more players get a chance at a World Series and (more importantly) there's more postseason revenue to go around. They will use it as a bargaining chip though.I have no idea what the next CBA will bring (no one does right now), but I am more confident in it bringing a 14-team postseason field than I am anything else.\nInternational draftAmateur players in the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico are subject to the draft every summer. Amateur players everywhere else in the world are free agents who can sign with any team. Once upon a time, teams could pay international free agents whatever they wanted. Nowadays it is still a free agent system, though there is a hard cap on spending in place each summer.During the last CBA negotiation, MLB offered to eliminate the qualifying offer system in exchange for an international draft. The MLBPA said no. MLB will try again for an international draft because it will keep costs down. The union could use it as a bargaining chip -- \"We'll give you an international draft for this, this, and that\" -- though they have opposed an international draft to date.ExpansionMLB is in the middle of its longest expansion drought since the league first expanded in 1961. Manfred has said he wants to put the wheels in motion for expansion before he retires in January 2029. That does not mean there will be 32 teams for the 2029 season. It just means Manfred wants the process to begin. Soliciting expansion bids, reviewing proposals, that kind of thing.\nThe union will surely be on board with expansion because it means more roster spots and more jobs. I'm not sure baseball is ready for expansion (there's barely enough pitching for 30 teams as it is), but it's coming either way. Expansion is unlikely to be a sticking point during CBA talks. It's just something that has to get put on the table and agreed to along the way.\n            ",

Duds happen, often out of nowhere; I can acknowledge that. But Monday's only top-10 matchup -- Houston-Iowa State inside Hilton Coliseum -- was both great on paper and on the court. And it was the latest awesome high-profile game in what is becoming one of the best college basketball seasons in modern-history.Final score: Iowa State 70, Houston 67.These days, best I can tell, you can't do better than plopping down in front of a television on a Monday night and finding college basketball. Three Monday nights ago, we had a projected one-and-done top-20 pick in the 2026 NBA Draft, Brayden Burries, getting 29 points in Arizona's 86-83 win at BYU. One Monday night later, we had Darryn Peterson, the presumed No. 1 overall pick of the 2026 NBA Draft, getting 19 points in Kansas' 64-61 win at Texas Tech. One Monday night after that, we got Kansas, minus-Peterson for whatever it was that kept him out of that game, handing Arizona its first loss of the season, 82-78. And then, one Monday night after that, last night, we got a tight contest between top-10 teams led by two of college basketball's best coaches -- Iowa State's TJ Otzelberger and Houston's Kelvin Sampson.Despise NIL and transfer-waivers all you want; I get it. College basketball is more different than it's ever been. But, all of that acknowledged, the on-the-court product has been undeniably terrific this season. Monday night was great. And I expect the same from Tuesday night -- mostly because that's when Michigan will visit Purdue in another top-10 matchup that looks incredible on paper, in part because of the stuff Yaxel Lendeborg brings to the matchup. The Wolverines are No. 1 in Tuesday morning's updated CBS Sports Top 25 And 1 daily college basketball rankings. Purdue is No. 7.Tuesday's tip is set for 6:30 ET.\nYou can watch it live on Peacock.

    "body": "\n        Bowl games aren't nearly as important as they once were, but they remain a measuring stick in college football. We've begun to see some fall by the wayside as teams have joined the ranks of NFL-bound players and opted out of playing in the games, but the fact of the matter is, missing out on a bowl because you didn't win enough games is a little embarrassing.Perhaps you aren't proud of that invite to the LA Bowl (RIP), but you aren't ashamed of it, either.Last year, 24 Power Four programs failed to reach bowl eligibility. Here, in mid-February, more than six months from the start of the 2026 season, it felt like a good time as any to take a look at those teams and their outlook on avoiding a repeat embarrassment in 2026. It's harder than ever to know how a program will progress from year to year now that we've seen so many one-offseason makeovers through the transfer portal, but after long hours of deep reflection, I broke our 24 contestants down into five separate categories. We'll start with the bad news and work our way to the good.Not Optimistic\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Boston College: After a 7-6 showing in Bill O'Brien's first season, the Eagles fell to 2-10 last year, and won only one ACC game -- a 34-12 win over an especially bad Syracuse team. Perhaps the Eagles will increase their win total next year, but it's tough to imagine they do so by four wins. \nNot only does BC get Notre Dame on the schedule this year, but it's going to South Bend. In conference play, it has road trips to SMU and Miami, and draws what should be a much-improved Virginia Tech. The Eagles also decided to play not one, but two nonconference games against Power Four opponents in Cincinnati and Rutgers. That's not the kind of scheduling teams who want to get to bowl games typically do outside of the conference.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Colorado: The Coach Prime experience has been a rollercoaster ride. After all the hype ahead of 2023, the Buffs laid an egg, going 4-8. They followed it up with a 9-4 record and a Heisman Trophy thanks to Travis Hunter, but life after Hunter and Shedeur Sanders wasn't nearly as friendly, as the Buffs fell back to 3-9. As is always the case, Deion Sanders and staff were active in the portal in an effort to reverse their fortunes. The problem is, like Boston College, Colorado is playing two nonconference games against Power Four opponents (Georgia Tech and Northwestern), and both are on the road. In conference play, the Buffs get both Texas Tech and Utah, though at least those games are in Boulder. It's difficult to predict how the Big 12 will shake out, but overall, the Buffs don't have many games against teams that finished in the bottom half of the league last season.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Maryland: Maryland is 8-16 the last two seasons and only 2-16 in Big Ten play. The Terps have a lot of young talent, and it's not out of line to see a major leap forward because of it, but the schedule is rough. They're on the road for Ohio State, USC, Nebraska, and Purdue, which could've been one of the more winnable games. They also have a nonconference game against a Virginia Tech team that should be a lot better in 2026. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Mississippi State: Jeff Lebby is 1-15 in SEC games in his first two seasons, though the Bulldogs did improve by three wins last year. Earning one more win isn't difficult in a vacuum, but the schedule next season is rough. They'll get Minnesota on the road, and have road conference games against South Carolina, LSU, Texas and Ole Miss. At home, they get Missouri, Alabama, Oklahoma, Vandy and Auburn. Even if they sweep their nonconference slate, they haven't shown enough to make me optimistic they can win three SEC games.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Syracuse: The Orange were wrecked by injuries at the QB position last year en route to a 3-9 mark, so better health alone could lead to better results. But will those results be good enough to get to six wins? It's tough because a lot of their ACC games that look like coin flip matchups on paper will be on the road. Furthermore, while they avoid Miami, they do have to play SMU, Clemson and Notre Dame. Six wins seem like we're asking a lot.\nSyracuse coach Fran Brown. \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Not Optimistic, But That's OK\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Arkansas: These four schools could get to bowl games, but probably won't, and it's not a big deal because they all have new(ish) coaches. A bowl would be great, but missing out wouldn't be the end of the world. It would just lead to more pressure heading into Year Two. That said, Arkansas has only been to a bowl game three times in the last nine seasons, so fans might feel differently. The problem for Ryan Silverfield (and all SEC coaches) is that now that the SEC has gone to nine games, it's much more difficult to find that sixth win. A road trip to Utah in September won't help the Hawgs cause much, either. Nor does having to play Georgia, Texas A&M, Vanderbilt and Texas. Those four combined to win 43 games last season. The \"worst\" team on the schedule from last year is either Auburn or South Carolina. It won't be easy.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Kentucky: Mark Stoops got the Wildcats to a bowl game every season from 2016-23, but missed out on the last two years. That's why Will Stein is in charge now! \nStein has a lot of work to do, though. Even if Kentucky goes 3-0 out of conference (not a given with Louisville), the Cats need to find three more wins against Alabama, Texas A&M, South Carolina, LSU, Oklahoma, Vandy, Tennessee, Florida and Mizzou. Oh, and five of those nine SEC games are on the road. So the reality is you're looking for three wins from four against Alabama, LSU, Vandy and Florida, and that's if you beat Louisville, too.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Purdue: Barry Odom is not in his first season at Purdue, but last year was looked at as more of a Year 0 situation than a Year 1. Purdue fans are well aware of the situation Odom inherited and how it won't be a quick fix. \nWhile Purdue's record (2-10) wasn't much of an improvement on 2024, it's hard to deny that it wasn't a much more competitive team. I expect further improvements in 2026, but the nonconference slate features games against Wake Forest and Notre Dame. In the Big Ten, the Boilermakers have five road games, including tilts against Penn State, Illinois, Iowa and Indiana. The home slate is manageable, but jumping from 2-10 to 6-6 or better is asking a lot.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Stanford: I don't think the expectations for Tavita Pritchard are very high in his first season. Stanford is looking to rebuild the program, and while it would love to see the team go bowling immediately, it's not a requirement, which is good because it'll be tough to get six wins. The Cardinal face Miami coming off a title game appearance, Notre Dame, reigning ACC champion Duke, Louisville, and James Franklin's new look Virginia Tech. And all of those games, aside from the Miami game, will be on the road. Stanford general manager Andrew Luck. \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Really Need To Win This Coin Flip\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Baylor:  These are all programs that weren't far from bowl eligibility in 2025 and could easily level up to get that sixth win, but the problem for their coaches is that simply reaching a bowl game might not be enough to see 2027. \nI mean, frankly, I'm shocked Dave Aranda is back for 2026! We all had this man on one of the hottest seats in the country entering 2025, and he held onto his gig despite going 5-7. The biggest problem Baylor faces is a schedule does few favors. The Bears draw both BYU and Texas Tech, as well as an out-of-league game against Auburn. Not only will this team need to improve, but it will also have to avoid every possible banana peel.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Kansas: Staying in the Big 12, the Kansas Jayhawks are coming off consecutive disappointing seasons. We were all throwing flowers at the feet of Lance Leipold following a 9-4 mark in 2023, but the 'Hawks are 10-14 over the last two seasons and only 7-11 in the Big 12. \nThis season's schedule is not impossible, but it's not simple, either. There's the Border War against Mizzou, and while Kansas avoids Texas Tech, it must play Utah and BYU. It also gets Arizona State, but at least that's a home game. Five of their nine Big 12 games are not.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    North Carolina: The NFL's 33rd Team had a tough go last season and usually found itself in the headlines for all the wrong reasons. Even though the Heels finished 4-8, I'm somewhat optimistic about improving by two wins in 2026. The Tar Heels should be more talented. The problem is that the schedule is not friendly. They will be on the road for Clemson and get Notre Dame and Miami at home. They also open the season in Ireland against TCU, and trips to Ireland have not been kind to many of the teams that play in that game in recent years. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    South Carolina: I don't know that 6-6 would save Shane Beamer, but after going 1-7 in the SEC last year, I suggest he tries to get there at a minimum. Considering this program was on the precipice of a playoff spot in 2024, last year's fall to 4-8 hurt even more. Now they have to deal with a nine-game SEC schedule while also playing a road game against Clemson outside the league. The good news is the Gamecocks get five of their conference games at home this year, and that's a big help. Also, three of those five feel winnable (Miss State, Kentucky, Tennessee). They're likely must-wins if the Cocks want to go bowling.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Rutgers: After leading Rutgers to consecutive bowls in 2023 and 2024, Greg Schiano's men fell to 5-7 last year. \nThe nonconference slate of UMass, Howard and a road trip to Boston College is manageable, and all things considered, the Big Ten slate isn't overly bearish. Yes, they have to play USC, Indiana and Michigan, but they're all coming to Piscataway. Road games against Maryland and Northwestern are more winnable than a lot of other possible road games they could be playing.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Wisconsin: Like Shane Beamer, I don't know if 6-6 saves Luke Fickell, but it's a minimum requirement. Wisconsin was in a bowl game every season from 2002-23, and now it's missed out each of the last two years. Fickell wasn't brought with Madison to flirt with bowl eligibility; he was supposed to flirt with playoff runs. The best news here is that the schedule is nowhere near as tough as last season's. However, that doesn't mean it's easy. The Badgers open with Notre Dame, but once they get into Big Ten play, they catch quite a few breaks. They aren't playing Ohio State, Oregon, Indiana, or Michigan. They do get both Penn State and Iowa on the road -- as well as a home game with USC -- but I think they'll take that trade every season.Wisconsin coach Luke Fickell leads the Badgers onto the field.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            In Play, But Not Necessary\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Auburn: Last year, Auburn had a good defense and an awful offense, so if Alex Golesh can just put some dang points on the board, that 5-7 mark from the last two years could flip pretty easily. I think there's a very real chance it will. The nonconference slate (Baylor, Southern Miss, Samford) isn't too imposing, and the Tigers avoid two of the SEC's five playoff teams from last season. Still, they do have to go on the road against Tennessee, Georgia, Ole Miss and Alabama. That won't be fun, and the home slate features Florida, Vandy and LSU. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Michigan State: Michigan State has not been to a bowl game since Kenneth Walker was running wild across everybody in his path. The same Walker who just won a Super Bowl in his fourth NFL season. Yeah, it's been too long for the Spartans, and there's a decent chance Pat Fitzgerald can get this team back to the postseason in his first year. Out of conference includes a road game against Notre Dame, but Sparty avoids Ohio State, Indiana, USC and Iowa in Big Ten play. They also get five home conference games against Nebraska, Illinois, Northwestern, Washington and Oregon. A 6-6 mark doesn't feel impossible.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Oklahoma State: Get ready to hear a lot of people tell you Oklahoma State is \"the next Indiana\" because Eric Morris has come from North Texas and brought the whole dang team with him, but I'm tempering my expectations a little. It's not impossible, but considering how bad this team was last year, six wins feels like a significant step forward, particularly when one of your nonconference games is Oregon. Still, in Big 12 play, you avoid BYU and Utah while getting Texas Tech at home. You do still have to play five of your Big 12 games on the road, though.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    UCF: Scott Frost's UCF return started with a 5-7 season as the Knights were simply uncompetitive outside The Bounce House. Well, seven of your games are at home this season, including five in conference play! And you don't have to play Texas Tech or Utah anywhere, and you get BYU at home! Furthermore, none of your road games -- against Houston, Oklahoma State, Kansas and Colorado -- feel impossible.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    UCLA: Hey, Bob Chesney, the last James Madison coach to take over a Big Ten program made the playoffs in Year 1 and won the natty in Year 2. No pressure! This was not a well-prepared team last year, and things went off the rails with the in-season firing of Deshaun Foster, so you would think consistency alone should lead to improved play. Also, a home slate that includes San Diego State, Purdue, Wisconsin, Michigan State, Nevada, Illionis and USC provides an opportunity to stack up some wins.Genuinely Optimistic\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Florida: The problem with the Gators last year was not talent. Watch the NFL Draft in April, and that will be evident. They will still be a talented team in 2026, but I consider the hiring of Jon Sumrall to be a massive upgrade on the sidelines. That alone will not be enough, as the Gators still have to navigate an SEC schedule. All that said, I'll be more surprised if the Gators miss out on a bowl for the second straight season than I would be if they make it.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Virginia Tech: Penn State could never break through in the Big Ten, so what if you import Penn State into the ACC? This is the question that will be answered as James Franklin and a huge chunk of the Nittany Lions 2025 recruiting class make the trek to Blacksburg. Of all the Power Four conferences, the ACC feels like the one with the softest underbelly, making rapid improvement likely, and I like Tech's chances. Now, they have to play Clemson, SMU, and Miami on the road, so I won't be going overboard and asking \"ACC contender!?\" like a bunch of others will, but I can see this team finishing 8-4.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    West Virginia: Yep! I am optimistic about West Virginia! It's not just that I think Rich Rodriguez is an underrated coach (he is), and that this team is more talented than many realize (it is), it's also the schedule. Three home nonconference games against Coastal Carolina, UT Martin and Virginia are winnable. The Mountaineers also get five Big 12 games at home, giving them eight home games on the season. They won't leave Morgantown until October. Road games against TCU, Texas Tech and Utah won't be fun, but Oklahoma State, Arizona, Cincinnati, Kansas and Houston all have to come to Milan Puskar Stadium. This team is going bowling.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Spring training is upon us, which means Opening Day is coming into view and the 2025-26 offseason is effectively behind us. This uplifting checkpoint on the MLB calendar gives us occasion to appraise the offseason work of all 30 teams. We'll do that by handing out letter grades to each based on estimations of what they're offseason goals were. Not every team's aim is contention, of course, and as unfortunate as that may be, we have to acknowledge when assessing how a club fared over the offseason. For the most part, though, this will be about the extent to which teams improved their on-field outlook for 2026 and beyond. Assume the position, squadrons. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Arizona Diamondbacks: BThe best move the D-backs made this offseason wasn't a move at all, but rather the decision not to trade All-Star infielder Ketel Marte. Elsewhere, Zac Gallen and Merrill Kelly are back in the rotation and Michael Soroka is new to it. The addition of decline-phase veterans Nolan Arenado and Carlos Santana probably don't move the needle all that much, but they do give manager Torey Lovullo some tactical options. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    (Sacramento) Athletics: CThe A's wisely committed to Tyler Soderstrom and Jacob Wilson for the long-term, and getting Jeff McNeil for cheap upgrades their second base situation. On the other hand, the A's didn't do enough to address their flawed rotation (Aaron Civale doesn't get it done) and that will likely be their undoing in 2026. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Atlanta Braves: CThe story of the 2026 Braves will largely be told by whether they get some rebound performances in the lineup and whether the roster is able to be healthier than it was in 2025 (Spencer Schwellenbach is already headed to the 60-day IL, so not a great start). While the Braves didn't make any huge splashes this winter, the newly arrived Mike Yastrzemski is a useful platoon bat in left and Robert Suarez improves the depth of high-leverage options in the bullpen. Shortstop, however, remains a major trouble spot. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Baltimore Orioles: BThe O's added some much-needed right-handed pop by bringing Pete Alonso and Taylor Ward on board. On the pitching side, Baltimore also made sound moves by adding Shane Baz to the rotation via intra-divisional trade, re-upping with Zach Eflin, and inking Chris Bassitt. They also fleshed out the bullpen with Ryan Helsley and Andrew Kittredge from the right side. The price in trade for Baz, however, was high, and the O's still don't have the ace they need. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Boston Red Sox: B+The Sox fortified the front of the rotation behind ace Garrett Crochet with the additions of Ranger Suárez, Sonny Gray, and Johan Oviedo. As well, Willson Contreras' right-handed thump should play well in Fenway. On the downside, Alex Bregman's departure in free agency will be keenly felt in the infield and in the lineup, but the trade for Caleb Durbin helps lessen the sting. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Chicago Cubs: BThe loss of Kyle Tucker to the Dodgers and the apparent complete lack of interest in trying to bring back the best free agent of the 2025-26 class are marks against the Cubs. On the upside, they stabilized the infield with the Alex Bregman addition and the trade for Edward Cabrera deepens the rotation and provides upside. There are lots of new faces in the bullpen, plus the Cubs wisely resisted the temptation to trade away second baseman Nico Hoerner. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Chicago White Sox: B+The ChiSox get an elevated grade largely because of the signing of Munetaka Murakami to a two-year contract. He's not a known quantity, but his power upside makes this a very worthwhile low-risk endeavor for Chicago. While the trade return in the Luis Robert Jr. deal wasn't particularly impressive, they did finally pull the trigger on it. The Anthony Kay and Sean Newcomb signings will help them cover innings at least. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Cincinnati Reds: C-The Reds last season snuck into the playoffs despite a pretty bad offense. The Eugenio Suárez signing helps that situation, but they really needed to do more on this front. Yes, JJ Bleday and Dane Myers are new to the outfield mix, but that doesn't achieve much. As well, useful 2025 contributors like Austin Hays, Nick Martinez, and Miguel Andujar may be missed. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Cleveland Guardians: C-The bullpen has some new faces in it, but otherwise the Guards will mostly be running it back in 2026. Yes, they made the playoffs thanks to a miracle finish to the regular season, but at heart this is a team that was outscored by the opposition in 2025. They really needed to address multiple spots in the lineup this winter, but the Dolans remain as uninterested and neglectful as ever. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Colorado Rockies: B-Coming off one of the worst seasons in MLB history, the Rockies badly needed a reboot and a step toward modernizing all of baseball operations. They did that, at least in theory, by bringing in Paul DePodesta as the lead decision maker. That's the biggest move of the winter in Denver. DePodesta has been out of the game for a long time, but he still constitutes a major step forward for the organization. Elsewhere, taking a swing on Edouard Julien as a buy-low, post-hype youngster is a sound move. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Detroit Tigers: A-We'll ignore the silliness of the Tigers' approach to Tarik Skubal's arbitration case and instead praise them for not trading him ahead of his walk year. Detroit is angling to make the postseason for a third straight year, and that wouldn't happen without Skubal. As well, the signing of Framber Valdez gives Detroit a worthy No. 2 in the rotation behind Skubal. The signing of franchise legend Justin Verlander is a crowd-pleaser and also deepens the rotation. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Houston Astros: BThe loss of Framber Valdez is a rough one, but the Astros have done a solid job of papering over his loss by signing Tatsuya Imai, trading for Mike Burrows, and plucking Ryan Weiss out of Korea. As a result, there's now impressive rotation depth despite the loss of their bedrock to the Tigers. The infield situation remains crowded, but \"crowded\" also doubles as depth that might be useful. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Kansas City Royals: BThe Royals' best move of the winter was inking the impressive Maikel Garcia to a long-term extension. There's also been some needed bullpen churn -- the Matt Strahm signing in particular is a welcome development -- and the addition of Lane Thomas improves the KC bench. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Los Angeles Angels: BGetting potentially four years of Grayson Rodriguez for one year of Taylor Ward was a great play by the Halos, even if Rodriguez hasn't been healthy in some time. He's a revival project of sorts, but he's exactly the kind of swing the Halos should be taking. Their remaining additions -- Vaughn Grissom, Alek Manoah, Drew Pomeranz, Jordan Romano, Kirby Yates -- all make varying degrees of sense, and some of them will likely work out. All that said, it's hard to squint and see the Angels being relevant in the tough AL West in 2026. As such, this could all turn out to be a lot of wheel-spinning.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Los Angeles Dodgers: AThe back-to-back champs remain the standard when it comes to investing in on-field success. Rather than rest on their substantial laurels this winter, the Dodgers went out and signed the best free agent available (Kyle Tucker) and landed an upgrade at closer (Edwin Díaz). The Tucker addition in particular was made to order, as they could use a younger presence within their core and better production from the outfield corners. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Miami Marlins: B+The Fish did well to land three prospects -- including the very promising Owen Caissie -- in trading Edward Cabrera to the Cubs. They also got good value in the Pete Fairbanks signing to shore up the high-leverage end of the bullpen. The story in Miami remains when and if they'll trade former Cy Young winner Sandy Alcantara, but otherwise the Marlins have done quality work this winter. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Milwaukee Brewers: CThe Brewers remain squarely in the discussion for \"best organization in baseball,\" but have they stretched their model to the limits this winter? The rotation will miss the stability of Freddy Peralta, who has three straight seasons of at least 30 starts and 200 strikeouts. As well, the Caleb Durbin trade was a bit of a strange one from the Milwaukee standpoint. Obviously, this organization has earned the benefit of the doubt, but in a vacuum these two major moves seem questionable. To be sure, the Brewers still very much profile as contenders in 2026. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Minnesota Twins: FThe Twins needed to make improvements in order to contend in the typically winnable AL Central, and their big move has been signing decline-phase Josh Bell. Their behavior at last year's trade deadline suggested a rebuild was in the offing, but the Twins didn't finish the job this winter. Trading Pablo López and Joe Ryan would've at least made the approach coherent, but instead the Twins seem to be indulging in half-measures. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New York Mets: B+Pete Alonso's thump and presence will be missed, as will Edwin Díaz's strikeout chops in the closer role. That said, the Mets have made a number of notable additions and reminded us why it's premature to evaluate a team's offseason until that offseason is complete. New to the scene are Bo Bichette, Freddy Peralta (a sorely needed stabilizing presence at the front of the rotation), Jorge Polanco, Marcus Semien, Luis Robert Jr., Devin Williams, and Luke Weaver. That's a significant makeover, and it's one that could help the Mets get back to the postseason. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New York Yankees: CRe-upping with Cody Bellinger, who put up a 5.1 WAR season in 2025, was a welcome development, but otherwise it was a fairly listless winter in the Bronx. On the pitching front, Ryan Weathers is the only addition to a rotation that figures to have serious health and durability concerns in the upcoming season. Hal Steinbrenner continues to refuse going full bore for the remainder of Aaron Judge's peak. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Philadelphia Phillies: BBringing back Kyle Schwarber, the top source of power in the 2025-26 free agent class, was essential, and they did that. As well, stalwart catcher J.T. Realmuto is back in the fold. Will the Phils regret letting Ranger Suárez walk? There's much riding on Zack Wheeler's return to form, whenever he's able to take the mound. That said, youngster Andrew Painter has elite upside, so the Suárez decision is defensible. Elsewhere, Adolis García probably doesn't adequately address their outfield issues. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Pittsburgh Pirates: BThe Pirates have at least been active, which is notable in light of Bob Nutting's standing as one of the worst team owners in all of sports. Overall, it's a mixed bag. The trade addition of Brandon Lowe adds power to the middle infield and he immediately gives the Buccos All-Star potential in the lineup. José Urquidy is also a solid low-risk addition to the back of the rotation. Somewhat less inspiring are the signings of Ryan O'Hearn and Marcell Ozuna. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    San Diego Padres: CBringing back Michael King was a welcome turn of events, but Dylan Cease's ace upside will be missed at the front of the rotation. The lineup is also aging in spots, and new addition Sung-Mun Song comes with an uncertain ability to hit MLB pitching. Budget restrictions and a thinned-out farm system limited what AJ Preller could accomplish this offseason. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    San Francisco Giants: DOne can make the case that the Giants' biggest move is hiring a college head coach as their manager. That's not optimal for a team trying to contend in the deep NL West. As for the moves involving actual players, they're not especially inspiring. Luis Arraez is a stretch defensively at second base, and Tyler Mahle and Adrian Houser don't sufficiently upgrade the rotation behind ace Logan Webb. Harrison Bader is a useful player, but the Giants really needed a true needle-moving addition this winter. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Seattle Mariners: AIs this the best team in the AL? That's a defensive question to ask after a strong winter in Seattle. The Brendan Donovan trade was an excellent targeted strike, and Jose A. Ferrer should be a strong long-term fixture in the bullpen. Re-signing Josh Naylor made a lot of sense, and Rob Refsnyder gives manager Dan Wilson a potent platoon bat. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    St. Louis Cardinals: B+The Cardinals' committed in word to the rebuild, and then first-year lead decision-maker Chaim Bloom committed to it in deed. In trading away Sonny Gray, Willson Contreras, Nolan Arenado, and Brendan Donovan, Bloom cleared paths for younger contributors in 2026 and beyond and, most importantly, greatly improved the organizational pitching depth and upside with those trade returns. The on-field results probably won't be pretty in St. Louis this season, but this was a necessary step. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Tampa Bay Rays: B-The Rays did really well with the return for Shane Baz in the trade with Baltimore -- an absolute haul, really -- and the signings of Steven Matz and Cedric Mullins should modestly help the cause in 2026. Nick Martinez is also a sensible addition. That said, Brandon Lowe will be missed and Gavin Lux probably won't come close to filling that void. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Texas Rangers: BThe Rangers were dealing with reported financial constraints this offseason, so in that light it's solid work. Brandon Nimmo and Danny Jansen are new to the lineup, the flawed bullpen has seen a great deal of turnover, and the trade for MacKenzie Gore infuses the middle of the rotation with relative youth and upside. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Toronto Blue Jays: B+Yes, the loss of the Bichette to the Mets via free agency certainly stings, but otherwise the reigning AL champs did good work over the winter. Dylan Cease brings swing-and-miss and ace potential to the rotation, and Kazuma Okamoto has real power potential. Tyler Rogers is also a nice add to the bullpen. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Washington Nationals: B+The Nats undertook a needed makeover in the front office and in the dugout, and that's what drives this grade. New POBO Paul Toboni brings youth and the capacity to modernize, and that Nats sorely need modernization. Elsewhere, getting Harry Ford and his upside in the Jose A. Ferrer trade with Seattle was a nifty move, and they got good bulk in the MacKenzie Gore trade with Texas. \n            ",

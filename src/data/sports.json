    "body": "\nThe final 'Monday Night Football' game of the 2025 NFL regular season will take place in Week 17 as the Los Angeles Rams visit the Atlanta Falcons.

The Rams lead the league in scoring offense, with the No. 6 scoring defense to boot, making them one of two teams to rank in the top six in both. Matthew Stafford is the MVP frontrunner as he has both the highest touchdown percentage and the lowest interception rate. He's complemented by the No. 5 rushing attack, and the ground game should find success versus an Atlanta run defense which ranks 25th in both yards allowed and yards per rush given up. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why the Falcons can coverThe Falcons are coming off back-to-back road victories, and they now return home, where they've won four of their last five meetings with the Rams. Kirk Cousins has brought stability to the offense, while Bijan Robinson is making a run for the Offensive Player of the Year award. He leads the league with 2,026 scrimmage yards, and he's averaging nearly 100 rushing, plus over 50 receiving, yards over his last six games. Additionally, the Rams defense has been leaky as of late as the two highest point totals it has allowed all season have come in the last two weeks. Finally, L.A. is just 4-7 ATS over its last 11 with a rest edge, as it enters in off a Thursday game. See which team to back at SportsLine. How to make Falcons vs. Rams            picksFor Rams vs. Falcons   on 'Monday Night Football,' the model is leaning Over the total, projecting 52 combined points.

Utah was expected to have head coach Kyle Whittingham for one more game, but his decision to take the Michigan job changed those plans, leaving the Utes to scramble with just days to go before the matchup. Dylan Raiola (injury/portal) is out for Nebraska, but freshman TJ Lateef got some quality experience late in the season and should be able to keep Nebraska within this big number.

The Bulldogs were 5-7 this year, but got the invitation because there weren't enough .500 teams available. MSU's roster is relatively intact, while Wake Forest has lost some key pieces to the transfer portal and isn't expected to have star running back Demond Claiborne after he declared for the NFL Draft.

    "body": "\n        Giannis Antetokounmpo returned from an eight-game absence Saturday night to lead the Milwaukee Bucks to a 112-103 win over the Chicago Bulls. The two-time MVP poured in 29 points, which he capped off with a fastbreak windmill dunk in the final two seconds after the game was already well decided.After the final buzzer sounded, Bulls forward Nikola VucevicVučević and guard Coby White approached Antetokounmpo to share their irritation with his unnecessary dunk which led to both benches emptying to defuse the situation.\n\"We're 11th in the East,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"Got to keep finding an identity. And if that's to get a little bit of scrappy at the end, so be it. We're not champs. Why should we play the clock out and have respect and fair play? We're fighting for our lives right now.\"The Bucks went 2-6 in Antetokounmpo's absence, and are just 13-19 on the season. While it's a night-and-day difference when Giannis is on the floor, the Bucks struggled to consistently string together wins, even in a weak Eastern Conference.\"This is real tough,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"I've been 13 years in the league. If we keep on losing, probably half of the team not going to be here. We're not going to make the playoffs. I really don't care. At the end of the day, I just want to be available, be healthy and help my team win. And if [a windmill dunk] is what has to happen for everybody to wake up and understand, we're fighting for our lives and we got to get our hands dirty, so be it.\"\nBulls players took exception with Antetokounmpo's actions.\"He shouldn't have dunked the ball,\" White said after the game. \"It's disrespectful to the game. I said, 'Bro, you're better than that.' The game is over with. Why you got to do that? It's a respect thing.\"Vučević tried to rationalize Antetokounmpo's actions, saying, \"I'm assuming Giannis was mad about that report that came out the Bulls didn't want to trade for him.\"\nTrade hype hovered over the Bucks for most of the season after a report surfaced that Antetokounmpo may request one by midseason. There are conflicting reports about his actual willingness to request a trade, but comments last night suggest he is not happy with the state of things in Milwaukee.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        With Jordan Love out of the game on Saturday, Malik Willis took over at quarterback for the Green Bay Packers and he played a nearly perfect game. Although the Packers got blown out, 41-24, by the Ravens, you can't blame the loss on Willis, who totaled 348 yards and three touchdowns. Willis was so good against the Ravens that the Packers didn't punt a single time in the game. Yup, that's right: The Packers didn't punt a single time and they still lost. And now, we get to the ugly part: The loss by Green Bay marks the third time this season that the Packers have lost a game where they didn't punt, which is the most by any team in the Super Bowl era. There have been 60 seasons played since the inception of the Super Bowl, and in that span, there had only been two teams that had even lost TWO games in a single season without punting the ball: The 2021 Chargers and 2024 Bengals. Both of those teams finished with a 9-8 record, which is almost fitting, because the Packers will also finish the season with nine wins if they lose to the Bears in Week 18. \n\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 17 playoff picture: Texans beat Chargers to clinch berth, hand Broncos AFC West crown; Ravens alive\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSince you might be wondering how a team could possibly lose three games where they didn't punt the ball a single time, let's break down how it happened. The Packers had their first no-punt loss back in Week 9 when Carolina beat them 16-13. The Packers had seven possessions in that game and here's how they played out: FumbleField goalField goalMissed field goalInterceptionFailed fourth downTouchdownThe Packer piled up 369 yards, but they only scored 13 points due to their costly miscues. The failed fourth down came from Carolina's 13-yard line in the fourth quarter, so that wasn't a situation where the Packers would have punted even if it had come at an earlier point in the game. \nThe Packers second loss with no punts came in Week 16 when they blew a 10-point lead against the Bears in the fourth quarter of a game they eventually lost in overtime. Here's how their possessions went in that 22-16 loss: Failed fourth down (Fourth-and-1 from Chicago 7-yard line)Field goalField goalKneel down to end halfFumble TouchdownField goalKneel down to end regulationFailed fourth down in overtime (Fourth-and-1 from Chicago 36-yard line)Once again, the Packers offense moved the ball up and down the field, but they had trouble finishing their drives. The failed fourth down in overtime ended up costing the Packers big because four plays after the fourth down failure, Caleb Williams hit D.J. Moore with a 46-yard game-winning touchdown pass. The Packers' third loss with no punts came against the Ravens. Once again, let's check out how their possessions went: \nTouchdownFailed fourth down (Fourth-and-1 at Green Bay 34-yard line)FumbleTouchdownKneel down to end halfField goalTouchdown InterceptionFailed fourth down (Fourth-and-8 at 50-yard line)The Packers went 0-for-2 on fourth down against the Ravens and that ended up being a huge factor in the game. They also went 1-for-3 on fourth down against the Bears, which means they've gone 1-for-5 over the past two weeks. When you're not punting, that usually means that your offense is playing well, and for that most part, that's been the case for the Packers, but they've also made several costly mistakes in their no-punt games, which is why they're now on the wrong side of NFL history. Thanks to these three no-punt games, Green Bay's Daniel Whelan has only had 41 punts this year, which is tied for the fourth-lowest number in the league for any punter that's played at least 15 games. Although Whelen hasn't punted much, he's actually been pretty solid this year: He's tied for the NFL-lead with a punting average of 51.3 yards and he ranks 11th overall in net punting average at 42.6. \n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The NFL world has seen the last of Maxx Crosby this season. Is it possible this is also the last of him with the Las Vegas Raiders? The Raiders shut down Crosby due to a knee injury, placing him on injured reserve. However, this was a decision with which the five-time Pro Bowler \"vehemently\" disagreed, according to Jay Glazer of Fox. Crosby argued he is healthy enough to play, and wanted to finish out the season. This decision will cause Crosby to evaluate his future with the Raiders organization, according to NFL Media. Glazer reports he spoke with Crosby on the phone, and relayed that the star pass rusher is \"not a happy camper right now.\" Crosby is set to have a meniscus trim, which is not a major procedure. On Saturday, he posted pictures and videos of him playing basketball and on a trampoline to his social media, which showed that he's not in debilitating pain that would force him off the field. The Raiders even felt the need to release a statement explaining their decision to place Crosby on injured reserve:\n\"After deliberate and thorough consultation with multiple top medical professionals, it became clear that this decision is in the best interest of both the franchise and the player. Maxx is the ultimate warrior, and he has fought extremely hard to compete each week with his teammates since injuring his knee mid-season.\"We are grateful for his extraordinary contributions. He is a true Raider on and off the field. We look forward to his leadership and toughness into 2026 and beyond.\"In 15 games played, Crosby recorded 73 tackles, 28 tackles for loss, 20 QB hits, 10 sacks, six passes defensed and his first career interception. Just nine months ago, Crosby signed a three-year, $106.5 million extension that includes $91.5 million guaranteed. The contract made him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history at the time. Crosby wanted to remain loyal to the franchise that selected him in the fourth round out of Eastern Michigan in 2019, even though he's seen just one winning season. It's possible things may have changed. \n            \n    ",

He played through the injury in the team's next three games before missing three games to try to recover from the injury. In his first game back from that absence, he registered 12 catches for 127 yards and three touchdowns.Overall, Bowers finishes the season with 64 receptions for 780 yards and seven touchdowns -- all team highs, but the first two categories significantly down from a historic 112-catch, 1,194-yard debut season. Bowers' 112 receptions were a rookie record, and his 1,194 yards were a rookie tight end record.A few days later, the Raiders shut down Maxx Crosby (knee), a decision Crosby disagreed with and one that has him evaluating his future with the franchise.\nThe Raiders finish the season with games against the New York Giants and against the Kansas City Chiefs. The Week 17 matchup in New York is an important one, as both teams sport 2-13 records, tied for the worst in the NFL. The loser of that game will take over the top spot in the NFL Draft order.Rice, 25, appeared in just 11 games. After being suspended the first six games of the season, he returned and provided an immediate spark to the offense, accruing 53 catches for 571 yards and five touchdowns. However, he reported concussion symptoms after Week 15 and was inactive in Week 16. Now, with Kansas City's playoff hopes extinguished and Patrick Mahomes (ACL) done for the season, the Chiefs have shut down Rice as well.\nHere's a list of notable players whose seasons have come to an end due to an injury in the past few weeks.Dec. 27: Raiders EDGE Maxx Crosby (knee)Dec. 24: Raiders TE Brock Bowers (knee)Dec. 24: Chiefs WR Rashee Rice (concussion)Dec. 24: Chiefs CB Trent McDuffie (knee)Dec. 24: Dallas Cowboys OT Tyler Guyton (ankle)Dec. 23: New York Jets QB Justin Fields (knee)Dec. 23: Cincinnati Browns RB Quinshon Judkins (leg/ankle)Dec. 20: Cowboys CB DaRon Bland (foot)Dec. 20: Giants EDGE Kayvon ThibodeauxDec. 19: Jets QB Garrett Wilson (knee)Dec. 19: Minnesota Vikings OT Christian DarrisawDec. 17: Green Bay Packers EDGE Micah Parsons (ACL)Dec. 17: Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes (ACL)Dec. 17: Vikings EDGE Jonathan Greenard (shoulder)Dec. 15: Washington Commanders QB Jayden Daniels (elbow)Dec. 13: Detroit Lions S Brian BranchDec. 13: Indianapolis Colts QB Daniel Jones (Achilles)Dec. 13: San Francisco 49ers WR Brandon Aiyuk (knee)Dec. 11: Cincinnati Bengals EDGE Trey Hendrickson (hip/pelvis)Dec. 1: Lions CB Terrion Arnold (shoulder)Nov. 26: Atlanta Falcons QB Michael Penix Jr. (ACL)\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Week 17 in the NFL is setting up to be an incredible week. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers will look to rebound against the Miami Dolphins, the New York Giants and Las Vegas Raiders will battle for the No. 1 overall pick, and the San Francisco 49ers aim to win their sixth straight game against a feisty Chicago Bears team.Who's scoring today? That's what everyone wants to know. Whether you're crafting the group-chat parlay or looking for a lesser-known name with some value, anytime TD bets have become one of the most popular wagers in the world of sports gambling. Below, we will break down five anytime TD bets to consider for Week 17. These will not be predictable choices like a Derrick Henry or Jonathan Taylor score, but they won't be wild long shots such as a team defense. Let's begin with an offense that found its rhythm last week. Odds courtesy of DraftKings Sportsbook1. WR Ja'Marr Chase, Cincinnati Bengals \nThe Arizona Cardinals have lost seven consecutive games, and rank last in scoring defense since Week 6 with 31.8 points allowed per game. Maybe more importantly, the Cards rank bottom 10 in passing defense with 224.1 yards allowed per contest. The Bengals are coming off a dominant 45-21 win over the Miami Dolphins, in which Joe Burrow threw for 309 yards and four touchdowns. While Ja'Marr Chase led Cincy with 109 yards receiving, he didn't find the end zone. This week, he will. \n\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 17 odds, predictions, expert picks: Can Panthers upset Seahawks? Who wins battle for No. 1 pick?\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n2. WR Mike Evans, Tampa Bay Buccaneers \nMike Evans has caught 11 passes for 163 yards and a touchdown in his two games since returning from injury. The Bucs need a win against the lowly Dolphins to guarantee they remain alive in the NFC South race, and I'm predicting Baker Mayfield comes out angry after Tampa Bay dropped six out of its last seven games. Evans finds the end zone.3. RB Saquon Barkley, Philadelphia Eagles \nThe reigning NFL Offensive Player of the Year has not only scored touchdowns in three straight games, but has also crossed 122 yards rushing in two out of the last three contests. This week, Barkley faces off against one of the worst run defenses in the NFL with the Buffalo Bills. They entered this week ranked third-worst in the league, allowing 144.3 rushing yards per game. Buffalo also allows 5.4 yards per rush, which ranks second-worst, and has allowed the most 30-yard rushing touchdowns in a season in NFL history with eight. This is a good matchup for Barkley and Jalen Hurts. 4. RB Tony Pollard, Tennessee Titans \nThe Titans are playing well these days. They've scored at least 24 points in the last three games, which includes a surprising shootout victory over the Cleveland Browns and a 26-9 beatdown of the Kansas City Chiefs last Sunday. Tony Pollard has been spectacular, having crossed 100 yards rushing in each of the last three games. He rushed for a career-high 161 yards and two touchdowns against Cleveland three games ago. Pollard didn't find the end zone last week, but I'm betting he does Sunday against the New Orleans Saints.\n5. WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Seattle Seahawks \nIf you bet on JSN to score a touchdown every week, you've won eight times and lost just seven. That's a pretty incredible run. Smith-Njigba leads the NFL in receiving yards (1,647), and has reached 90 yards receiving in 10 out of the last 11 games. Sunday marks a revenge game for Sam Darnold, who would surely like to blow out his former team in the Carolina Panthers. JSN will again be a major part of the game plan.\n            ",

    "body": "\nA pair of division titles - the final two postseason berths - could be secured in Week 17 of the 2025 NFL season. The Pittsburgh Steelers can capture their first AFC North crown since 2020 with a road victory against the Cleveland Browns, and the Carolina Panthers can end Tampa Bay's four-year reign in the NFC South with a home win against the Seattle Seahawks and a Buccaneers loss to the Dolphins in Miami.Pittsburgh (9-6), which defeated Cleveland 23-9 at home in Week 6, will make its fifth trip to the playoffs in six seasons and render its Week 18 showdown with the Baltimore Ravens meaningless by posting its fourth consecutive victory. The Browns are looking to snap their four-game losing streak.Carolina (8-7), which hasn't won the division since 2015, gained the upper hand in the NFC South by edging Tampa Bay 23-20 at home last week. It was the third straight setback and sixth in seven games for the Buccaneers (7-8), who must end their slide keep alive their postseason hopes as they host the Panthers in a potential clash for the division title in Week 18.For Sunday's matchups, top sportsbooks have set the passing yards prop for Pittsburgh's Aaron Rodgers at 183.5 yards, Jaxon Smith-Njigba of Seattle's receiving yards prop at 90.5 and the rushing yards prop for Tampa Bay's Bucky Irving at 62.5.Before you play a side on Rodgers, Smith-Njigba, Irving or any player prop for Week 17 of the NFL season, you need to see what SportsLine player prop expert PropBetGuy has to say. The expert is +1267 on his last 73 NFL player prop picks. Here are his picks and analysis.Darnell Washington Over 26.5 receiving yards\nAnother week, another Washington Over.Washington has cleared this receiving yards line in four of his last seven games when fully healthy, coinciding with a bump in his snap and route share. The Steelers will be without receivers DK Metcalf and Calvin Austin on Sunday, which should create even more opportunities for the massive tight end.The Browns employ man coverage at the league's highest rate, and Washington now owns the highest target rate of the Steelers' pass catchers against man (23.5%, per PFF), sans Metcalf.The weather will be rough but Washington's low average depth of target and yards-after-catch ability should keep him plenty involved. I'd bet this up to Over 27.5 yards.Colston Loveland Over 3.5 receptions\nLoveland has cleared this line in six of his last eight games, despite a string of brutal matchups and weather. He'll have neither of those on Sunday Night Football in San Francisco.The 49ers really have struggled to defend tight ends since losing star linebacker Fred Warner for the season. Higher volume pass-catching tight ends have thrashed this defense – Trey McBride had 10 receptions while Kyle Pitts hauled in seven passes.Overall, the 49ers allow the most catches per game out of the slot (7.8, per Fantasy Points), and the seventh-most to in-line tight ends (3.4). Loveland should thrive in a better passing environment than what he's experienced over the last few weeks. I'd bet this up to -145.\n            ",

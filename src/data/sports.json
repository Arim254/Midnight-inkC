Miller said despite the conversation around MetLife, it actually had \"one of the lowest injury rates across the league\" in 2024.\"It's playing really well and it has for a while,\" Miller said.\nThe NFL's injury data in 2024 showed that MetLife is ninth-best in terms of lower-extremity injuries and is first for visiting players. In 2023, MetLife turned to an updated version of FieldTurf, FieldTurf Core system, that is aimed at decreasing injuries. The conversation surrounding the safety level of the MetLife turf was re-ignited after Giants wide receiver Malik Nabers suffered a season-ending knee injury last month. Other recent and notable injuries occurring at MetLife include Aaron Rodgers and Jaelan Phillips suffering Achilles injuries in 2023.\n        \n            \n                MetLife Stadium playing surface under the microscope again following Malik Nabers' knee injury\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nESPN reported earlier this month that one executive from an opposing team playing at the stadium said players are \"petrified\" to play there and some may be more likely to sit out if they are dealing with a lingering injury already. The report states that 90% of players prefer to play on grass than artificial turf. The Jets say since 2023, grass fields saw more knee ligament or Achilles tears.\nFormer Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. made his thoughts known about the field following Nabers' injury. Beckham, who suffered an ankle fracture at MetLife in 2017, asked the NFL to \"get rid of the turf.\"\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        LOS ANGELES -- It's not hyperbole that the Golden State Warriors' offseason quite literally revolved around Jonathan Kuminga. So much so, the organization didn't even have enough players on their active roster to run a five-on-five scrimmage until they figured out which direction they wanted to take with Kuminga.Sure, the Warriors had commitments from veterans such as Al Horford, Gary Payton II and De'Anthony Melton lined up, but that didn't matter. Golden State couldn't move forward without figuring out what to do with its 23-year-old restricted free agent forward. After all the dust settled, Golden State ended up being the last team in the association to add a newcomer either via free agency or on the trade market.Waiting to decide on Kuminga's future until just weeks before their season-opener on Tuesday against the Los Angeles Lakers was no doubt a risk. However, the Warriors' thinking -- and almost no-brainer decision to bring Kuminga back and kick the can down the road -- appears to be the right one. Kuminga finished with 17 points, nine rebounds and six assists in 33 minutes during the Warriors' 119-109 win over the Lakers and showed why the best version of Golden State revolves around him being at his best.\"He has really matured,\" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. \"We have had some really good conversations. He has a better understanding. ... I think he just has a better sense of what is needed now compared to past years. I think Jimmy (Butler) has really helped him, too.\"\nPart of why Kuminga is still the biggest unknown on this roster is that there are flashes -- like Tuesday -- that prove he should be a crucial cog in the long-term plan. But, at the same time, the reason there have been question marks -- and why he signed a two-year, $48 million deal to return -- is that there have been perplexing stretches during his career that could lead to an inevitable divorce down the line.Kuminga wants to be featured. It's why the pitch from the Sacramento Kings -- who were reportedly interested in him this summer -- might have been enticing to his camp. Had Kuminga been traded this summer, he could have been a full-time starter in a low-stakes environment. That obviously didn't happen, but the Warriors could still hypothetically trade him starting on Jan. 15.For now, Kuminga is a Warrior. And they both need this partnership to work -- for however long it may end up lasting -- to chase a fifth title for this core. Kuminga might be the biggest X-Factor on the team outside of the obvious \"Big Three\" of Stephen Curry, Jimmy Butler and Draymond Green, simply because of his unique blend of size and athleticism.\nKuminga didn't shoot well in the first half of the opener, but he added value by creating second-chance opportunities and being disruptive on the defensive end. He also had the toughest assignment on the floor by getting matched up with Lakers star Luka Dončić in extended stretches.\"For him, it hasn't been easy to find minutes on our team,\" Kerr said. \"I'm really proud of him for staying with it and really maturing. It's a great start for him and a great start for us.\"Kuminga has shown what he can do in a high-stakes environment such as last season's playoffs against the Minnesota Timberwolves, where he played 27.4 minutes and averaged 20.8 points, 3.0 rebounds and 1.2 assists during the five-game series. But before that, he was getting DNPs during the home stretch of the regular season. The hamstring injury to Curry in the playoffs against Minnesota forced Kuminga into a more prominent role -- which he capitalized on -- that left more questions than answers.\nWhy can't Kuminga be like that on a more consistent basis? It's quite literally a multi-million dollar question.The reality of how the Warriors built their roster is that there will be games when Curry, Butler, Green and Horford need to rest. Kerr already said this month that Horford won't be playing in back-to-backs this season and because Golden State has 15 back-to-backs, there could be plenty of opportunities for Kuminga to thrive in a featured role.Kuminga remains the biggest mystery on the Warriors roster. In fact, a performance like Tuesday's begs the question of how he ended up out of Golden State's rotation in the first place. \nAt the same time, he needs to be at his best to justify the chaos Golden State went through this offseason. If this was a preview of what this season could be, the Warriors will be vindicated in playing the long game because Kuminga appears to be bought into the vision of what the franchise hopes to accomplish.\"When you ask for opportunity, you must deliver,\" Green said after Tuesday's win. \"I think he has been very vocal about his opportunity and he delivered. When you see a guy who's willing to put his neck on the line and be vocal, and they deliver, you must reward them.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Heading into Champions League play, Luis Enrique, the manager of reigning champs PSG, reflected on what took place in last season's final, a 5-0 win over Inter, and what's to come.\"The first title is always difficult because the players don't think they're capable of winning it. But we showed the way,\" said the Spanish coach. \"Now, the whole of PSG and the young players want to win because they know they're capable. For me, it's harder to win the first than the second or third.\" Following an away trip to Bayer Leverkusen on Tuesday, where they won 7-2, he may be correct in that declaration. It was a topsy-turvy match with both teams going down to 10 men, but with PSG growing a three-goal lead by halftime, you'd assume something like an Ousmane Dembele hat-trick got them to that point, considering he scored an eye-watering 35 goals last campaign. But he wasn't in the starting XI after returning from a hamstring injury that has kept him out since the end of August. Neither was two-thirds of the midfield that won that title, with Fabian Ruiz and Joao Neves both missing out with injuries. \nDembele did enter the match during the second half and only needed three minutes to show why he was the Ballon d'Or winner, giving PSG a four-goal advantage, but now, after three matches, PSG sit atop the Champions League league phase table with three wins, 13 goals scored, and only three conceded. Bayern Munich or Real Madrid can catch them on Wednesday, but as teams are getting into the swing of UCL play, it's clear that PSG are among the favorites, if not the favorite, to win the competition again, filled with not only incredible talent but tremendous depth.\nOn Tuesday, 20-year-old Desire Doue led the line, scoring a brace, while 19-year-olds Warren Zaire-Emery and Senny Mayulu paced the midfield. This is a deep squad, and the experience these young players are gaining will be invaluable in the long run for their development. Teams have to fill in for injuries all the time, but few can do it at the level that Enrique's men can. They're already on the right path to direct qualification for the round of 16, and they haven't hit top gear yet. With contenders such as Liverpool and Barcelona showing defensive concerns, Real Madrid looking to find their footing under a new manager, and Napoli struggling on their return to Champions League play, it only aligns things better for PSG to win a second consecutive title. That doesn't mean it will be an easy road with Manchester City, Arsenal, and Bayern Munich all performing at a high level, but you can see where Enrique's words come from.\nLast season, there was pressure on his team to deliver something that had never been done in PSG's history, and while there's still pressure to win things now, knowing that they can do it and having the weight lifted from their shoulders makes it easier to play. Enrique has been an excellent tactician to have his team prepared as well. Goncalo Ramos said that Harry Kane showed him how to beat Barcelona's offside trap, and the attention to detail by this club is second to none.With Dembele sidelined, contributions have come from everywhere, with four players scoring two goals in UCL play so far, and no player accounting for more than two goals. Six players scored their seven goals on the night, showing how unselfish this team has been under Enrique. What used to be a collection of stars who came together to chase European glory and failed became a team who will be tough to stop by anyone in their path, just like last season showed. With Dembele back, even more so.If PSG are showing that injuries can't stop them in their chase to repeat as European champions, no one may be able to stop them but themselves.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        What a return to basketball we saw on the NBA's opening night. The 2025-26 season began with the defending champion Oklahoma City Thunder hosting the Houston Rockets and their former star, Kevin Durant, as they hoisted their banner and received their rings from June's championship. The NBA hoped that bringing Durant back to Oklahoma City would deliver some drama, and it absolutely did, as the Thunder pulled out a 125-124 double-overtime victory.The game was one of the more exciting you'll probably see all season. The Rockets led most of the way, but the Thunder clawed back into the game in the fourth quarter and sent the game to overtime. In the first extra period, it was Oklahoma City who built a big lead, but Houston managed to tie things up ahead of one last Thunder possession. A Shai Gilgeous-Alexander miss in the closing seconds looked to end that first overtime period in yet another tie.Except, before the clock officially expired, it looked as though Durant called a timeout after gathering the rebound. The problem? Houston didn't have a timeout. Therefore, the Rockets should have been assessed a technical foul, and Oklahoma City theoretically should have been awarded a potential game-winning free throw. However, the officials seemingly didn't notice, and the game continued into the second overtime.\n\"Kevin definitely called timeout about three times verbally and physically with his hands,\" Gilgeous-Alexander told reporters after the game. \"I think the refs just missed it. That's life. You make mistakes in life.\"\nIt's a technical foul we see called every now and then, and it happened most notably to Chris Webber in the 1993 National Championship Game when he was playing for Michigan. But it's still a rarity, and it would have been an embarrassment for Durant to begin his Rockets tenure by potentially blowing his debut against his former team on such a mistake.\"None of the three game officials saw Kevin signal that timeout,\" crew chief Zach Zarba explained after the game. \"That's why it wasn't granted before the expiration of time.\"\nSo, Durant was bailed out. The officials missed the signal. The game resumed in the second overtime, and the Rockets still had a chance to win. Ironically, it was another Durant mistake that gave the game to the Thunder. In the closing seconds with Houston leading by one, Gilgeous-Alexander managed to get Durant in the air early and drew a foul as a result. He made both free-throws, and that was the difference in the Thunder victory.\n            ",

The Raiders' meeting with Crosby comes after the four-time Pro Bowler had been linked to other teams via trade, including the Dallas Cowboys, in rumors that circulated on social media in recent days.Crosby, who has been with the Raiders since being chosen by them in the fourth round of the 2019 NFL Draft, is Las Vegas' biggest star and best player, making him an attractive asset amid a 2-5 start to the season. Crosby, however, reportedly wants to remain in Las Vegas and continue to try and win with the only team he has played for in his NFL career. \n        \n            \n                Maxx Crosby injury: Raiders star pass rusher exit from loss to Chiefs was 'more of a precaution,' per report\n                \n                    Jordan Dajani                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nCrosby, 28, has become the face of the Raiders franchise as he has emerged as one of the best pass rushers in the NFL, and he is in the midst of yet another productive season with four sacks, 10 tackles for loss, five passes defensed and his first career interception, among other stats. Crosby signed a three-year, $106.5 million extension in March.\nWhile the Raiders will keep Crosby around, their front office continues to grapple with dealing another asset as wide receiver Jakobi Meyers doubled down on his desire to be traded when speaking to reporters on Tuesday. Meyers has been seeking to play for another team since requesting a trade from the Raiders this offseason after not receiving a new contract, but he was not dealt prior to the start of the regular season.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        We're now more than a third of the way through the NFL's 2025 season, which means we have a ton of information about what these teams are and where they might be going. We're obviously going to get a lot more the rest of the way, and things could change pretty drastically in just a few weeks, but there is plenty to glean from.That allows us to make some educated guesses about which teams are good and bad, contenders versus pretenders and preparing for the draft or thinking about the Super Bowl. As such, we're putting all 32 NFL teams into tiers based on where they stand after seven weeks.We're putting the league into four buckets: the inner and outer circles of contenders, fringe playoff teams and draft preparations. Those tiers are below with the teams in them listed alphabetically.Tier 4: Draft preparationsBrowns, Cardinals, Dolphins, Giants, Jets, Raiders, Saints, TitansSome of these teams are better than others, but they all have records of 2-5 or worse -- especially in the NFC with 12 of 16 having records of .500 or better. If you're 2-5, your season is probably not going anywhere.\nThis applies to the Cardinals and Giants, who seem like they might be a tier above the rest of this group but have records that put them in the same category. They'd need to rip seven or nine wins the rest of the way just to make a run at the playoffs, and that's probably not happening.Others like the Dolphins, Saints and Titans only have one win seven weeks into the season while the Jets are winless. They're all, pretty clearly, done for and playing out the string.Tier 3: The fringeBears, Bengals, Broncos, Chargers, Commanders, Cowboys, Falcons, Jaguars, Panthers, Ravens, Steelers, Texans, VikingsThis 13-team bucket is the largest tier by far, comprising almost half the league. It's full of OK teams with some major flaws that likely prevent them from being true contenders. They're not quite getting ready for the draft just yet but also shouldn't be selling playoff tickets and definitely shouldn't be making hotel reservations in the Bay Area for Super Bowl LX.\nThe Bears have won four in a row and their run game suddenly looks quite dangerous, but Chicago's defense has been suspect for much of the season. The Bengals are quarterbacked by Joe Flacco and their defense is highly flammable.The Broncos have a great defense, but it just got torn apart by the Giants, and the Bo Nix-led offense has been extremely inconsistent. The Chargers' injury issues are threatening to tank yet another season.The Commanders are 3-4 while Jayden Daniels deals with an injury for the second time this year and their upcoming schedule is daunting. Dallas might have the league's best offense and worst defense.\nThe Falcons can run the ball and have a defense that is playing great, but the passing attack comes and goes, which just doesn't work in the modern NFL. The Jags look like they were entirely too dependent on those early season turnovers that they kept forcing.The Panthers have beaten up on a soft defensive schedule with a trio of one-score wins that don't look indicative of the rest of their season. The Ravens are 1-5 and only here because of all their injuries and the fact that the AFC North is just not good.If the Steelers hadn't lost to the Bengals this past week, they might be in the tier above this. But they get the Packers, Colts and Chargers in their next three games and -- one way or another -- things could look much different for them soon.\nThe Texans lost three one-score games to start the year and then blew out two bad teams before losing against the Seahawks on Monday night. Who knows what to do with them. The Vikings have one of the league's most creative defenses, but it's hard to trust their offense given the quarterback situation.Tier 2: The outer circle49ers, Buccaneers, Colts, Eagles, Packers, Patriots, SeahawksThese teams are probably top contenders, but there is maybe just one thing that holds us back from placing them among the elite.For the 49ers, it's the injuries. How long can they keep doing what they're doing without their top guys? They'll get healthier on offense but Nick Bosa and Fred Warner aren't coming back. Defensive coordinator Robert Saleh has made it work so far, but can that continue?\nThe Bucs are everybody's favorite team to watch early in the season, but we saw on Monday night how things can look different when they don't stage their weekly miracle comeback. Four of their five wins have come by a combined 10 points, and four all of them saw the game-winning points scored in the final minute. That's highly unsustainable.The Colts look like world-beaters. Their offense is a machine. And I still cannot bring myself to trust a Daniel Jones-led offense just yet. Am I waiting too long? Maybe. But I feel comfortable waiting more than seven games.Everything has looked difficult for the Eagles this year, especially on offense, where the run game has just not looked the same as it did last season. They also can't really rush the passer. They're in this tier because they have the talent and record, but they haven't looked the part for much of the season.\nThe Packers appear to have the highest ceiling of any team in this tier and perhaps the entire league, but they haven't hit it since Week 2. When are we going to see that team again?Drake Maye is a breakout superstar, and the Patriots are rolling. Only one of their five wins is against a team worth writing home about (more on that in a second), though, and I'd really like to see what their defense looks like against another offense worth its salt before moving them into the inner circle.The Seahawks can reach an extremely high level on both sides of the ball -- especially when they're healthy in the secondary. All of their wins are against pretenders, though, and they've lost the two times when they've played teams in this tier. I want to see what it looks like for them if and when they get down in a game and need to stage a comeback, too.\nTier 1: The inner circleBills, Chiefs, Lions, RamsHave the Bills looked like world-beaters this year? Not exactly. But armed with Josh Allen and always in the mix for the AFC title, they have to think that the only way their season could be considered a major success is if they finally break through and make -- and even win -- the title game.The Chiefs are rounding into form, winning four of their past five games and looking as explosive offensively as we've seen them in years. Their defense has also stepped it up lately in a way that it hadn't early in the season. That unit is coming off its best performance of the season. We also know that the Chiefs are annually in the conference title game and have gone to three consecutive Super Bowls.The Lions still have one of the best rosters in the NFL. They should get healthier over the course of the season and that should help their defense get back into fighting shape. Their offense is explosive as any in the league, and it can be ruthlessly efficient when set up in the right game script. They didn't get their chance last year thanks to injuries, but they have to be thinking big again.\nThe Rams could easily be 6-1 right now were it not for a blocked kick against the Eagles. Even without Puka Nacua, their offense just put up five touchdowns over in London. Their defense still has some question marks (namely at outside corner) but is a strong enough unit to make a run with Matthew Stafford nearing the end of his career.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        NEW YORK — A year ago in this very building, Dan Hurley made the media rounds at Madison Square Garden and pitched why UConn should have been ranked No. 1 heading into the season.Coming off back-to-back national titles, the Huskies were No. 3 in the preseason AP Top 25 poll. Nevertheless, Hurley was on top of the sports world, proudly and unabashedly chasing a third consecutive national title and eager to sniff out any doubters over Connecticut's chances at pursuing the near-impossible in the modern age of college sports. And then, the most taxing and controversial season of Hurley's life toppled his ego and was such a shock to his senses that it prompted the 52-year-old to consider stepping away from coaching in the aftermath of UConn's 24-11 season that ended without a Sweet 16 appearance, as a No. 8 seed. \"Having a year like we just had, which was very challenging, it took me to a point where I did think about taking a gap year or being done,\" Hurley told CBS Sports on Tuesday. \"I had a shit year. I didn't coach my best, I didn't lead my best. I didn't put together a group that could compete for the things we wanted to compete for.\"\nThe story of the 2024-25 Huskies has been rehashed to death, but it doesn't mean reflection is unwarranted, especially on the precipice of the '25-26 season. Reflection is why Hurley is here and it's why I'm writing this column. Hurley being at the center of controversy and bargaining his way back to good behavior reinforces his standing as one of the most interesting people in college sports. He's readily available with the media as much as any high-profile coach in America. He'll debate you on the particulars but is always willing to admit his wrongs when it's clear he's out of line.It hasn't stopped him or his program from building out what appears to be another Final Four contender.So here is Hurley again, just like last year and the year before that, with his team occupying a spot in the preseason top five. Only this time, he seems determined to take a different approach with his comportment as much as he mentally and physically can. \nIt's not just the volume of losses that he doesn't want to experience again — it's the embarrassment to his players and family that he'd like to avoid. He knows it won't be easy. In speaking to Hurley both Tuesday and in a previous lengthy conversation over the summer, he's owning up to his behavior and not looking for excuses. Everything spun out from the 0-3 Maui disaster last November, which led to UConn becoming just the second team ever to go from a top-five ranking to unranked in a week's time.\"What I gave the cameras today was … Oppenheimer,\" Hurley told me in a daze under the Hawaiian morning sun outside the team bus after that Nov. 25 loss to Memphis, which included a sideline meltdown near the end of the game. His self-inflicted tribulations only got worse after Maui, from a variety of run-ins with officials and fans, and even some occasional tangles behind the scenes with certain members of the media. \"It became personal at times for me,\" Hurley said.\n        \n            \n                An all-access look at how Dan Hurley prepared UConn for Maui before the Huskies' disappointing loss to Memphis\n                \n                    Matt Norlander                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nFriendly advice from a familiar faceAmong Hurley's most crucial advisors is Geno Auriemma, who can be dogmatic in his own way, but has mastered basketball coaching on a level few have ever matched. He can call Hurley on his actions and has the résumé to mandate the respect of essentially any coach in the country, basketball or otherwise. Auriemma women's coach was maybe the most important person other than Hurley's wife to keep him from going completely sideways last season.\n\"Geno was able a couple times to talk me out of some bad mental states I was in,\" Hurley said. \"I coached that team angry, I coached them with too much ego where, you know, if we weren't performing at a NCAA championship level, instead of helping them get better and max out their potential, I just got mad at my team all winter.\"Some of that anger manifested in public ways and at strange times, like when TV cameras caught him in that mid-January game against Butler, scolding a ref: \"Don't turn your back on me. I'm the best coach in the f---ing sport.\"In the aftermath, Hurley hated himself for even thinking it, let alone saying it in the heat of a game. So he's trying to atone for that kind of behavior before the season arrives. Because he knows a new season brings potential for a new sea of emotions to try and voyage across.\nIt sounds like he's just about through getting over last year's chop.\"There's a tax you pay for the success of the past couple of years,\" Hurley said. \"Then we end the year with an emotional loss, and we have one final incident to end the year which takes all the focus away from everything we'd done the last couple years.\" He's referring to the thriller in the second round against Florida, a nail-biting 77-75 loss. The Gators received as tough of a punch vs. the Huskies as any team on their way to winning the national championship. But the story afterward wasn't the Huskies and Gators putting on one of the best games of the 2025 tournament. It was again about Hurley, who was caught on camera telling Baylor players \"I hope they don't f--- you like they f----- us\"  as the Bears were about to jog out to the court.UConn coach Dan Hurley was calm, cool and collected Tuesday for Big East Media Day.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            \"It was all my doing,\" Hurley told CBS Sports. \"I'm not a victim. We have enough victims in the world. I did it to myself and I did it throughout the year. We were not able to really celebrate the run we had because all the attention was on the jackass that I acted like in the tunnel. I think all those things combined to put me in a state where I had to consider what I wanted to do next.\"\nThat regrettable moment came two months after a win at Creighton, when Hurley was emphatically booed by Bluejays fans as he took his time leaving the court. A Creighton fan caught Hurley's attention so much that he yelled back, \"Two rings! Two rings, baldy!\" \"If I can avoid the fan stuff at the end,\" Hurley said. \"I'd love to be able to just take myself from when the game is over to the tunnel and back to the locker room nicely this year. I would like that.\" Seems easy enough. Almost every other coach can handle it. To his own admission, Hurley brings it on himself. Will he be able to resist one word, one gesture the whole season to any drunken or out-of-line fan just trying to needle him for a reaction?\nThis would be the moment most other coaches would simply give a \"yes.\"Hurley's not so simple.\"I don't know,\" he said.\" I've done a lot of work on myself this offseason to prepare myself for that. I just want to get to and from the court at the end of the games more seamlessly and avoid that. That is the part that deserves the criticism. When fans yell at you in the tunnel, even as obscene and nasty and personal as it is, just go to the locker room, man. Just get to the locker room.\"Lest you think this is a personality makeover, hardly. Hurley's just trying to shave off the worst of his instincts and keep everything inside the lines. There are certain things about his coaching style that won't change. In the spirit of some personal growth, I asked Hurley if this would also lead to a change in in-game activities as it pertains to the ebbs and flows of a 40-minute battle. Is a docile Hurley suddenly going to materialize on the sidelines?\"No,\" he said. \"You'll see the same me. But for me, getting back to my values as a coach. There will always be, as the coach at UConn and as a Hurley in basketball, a life-or-death urgency to the pursuit of championships and greatness and excellence. There's an energy and intensity you bring to the sidelines that won't change. But also while that's going on, enjoying the relationships and getting the most out of my team.\"\nHurley insists the Groundhog Day-like issues that he, his staff and his players grinded through for months last fall and winter won't be their reality over the next five months. That was backed up by Tuesday's release of the preseason All-Big East team, wherein three Huskies (on a seven-man team, which is odd and uncalled for) were recognized as senior forward Alex Karaban, junior shooting guard Solo Ball and senior center Tarris Reed Jr. all earning first team honors. There are approximately 360 coaches who'd trade away two or three of their good players for just one guy with four years in the program who's won at the highest level and is fully dedicated to the school and the staff. That's Karaban. UConn's leader. Hurley seems determined to not waste Karaban's senior season after he bypassed a great chance to go to the NBA in 2024, only to have a frustrating and inconsistent junior year. \"We've got the traits, we've got the talent, we've got the depth,\" Hurley said. \"I think I'll be a better leader for my team.\"\nHurley made himself into a Hall-of-Famer by refusing to bend on his principles. That doesn't mean he can't change. Both can be true at the same time. Balancing the cerebral with the emotional is what brought him to the top of the sport and could very well get him back to the apex again.To know Dan Hurley is to know that he can't change, he can only try to get better. If he makes good on his intentions, Connecticut's probably going to be one of the best teams in the country again.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Michael Jordan made his debut as a broadcast contributor for NBC at halftime of the NBA season opener between the Oklahoma City Thunder and Houston Rockets, writing a new stanza in his legacy as a basketball figurehead. In an effort to \"pay it forward\" and further the game, Jordan will appear on select broadcasts throughout the 2025-26 season and offer his perspective on basketball, although his official role and the nature of his appearances is still unclear.The first segment was a pre-recorded interview at Jordan's house in which he peeled the curtain back on his relationship with the sport and how and why he aims to be involved moving forward.Jordan's post-retirement life has included a diminishing amount of basketball as he places an emphasis on spending time with family. In fact, he said he has not \"picked up a ball in years.\" The last time the Chicago Bulls legend took a shot was, in true Jordan fashion, at a golf tournament.\n\"I was at the Ryder Cup, and I rented a house from the owner,\" Jordan said. \"He came over to do pictures. He had grandkids. I was doing the meet-and-greet, thanked him for allowing me to stay at the house. He had a basketball court. He said, 'I want you to shoot one free throw.' I said, 'Really?' I already paid for the house; it's not like he had to see me.\"So when I stepped up to shoot the free throw, it's the most nervous I'd been in years. The reason being is those kids heard the stories from their parents about what I did 30 years ago. So their expectation is 30 years prior, and I haven't touched a basketball.\"\nHe made the shot.\"That made my whole week,\" Jordan said, \"that I was able to please that kid not knowing if I could.\"It has been 22 years since Jordan last suited up in an NBA uniform, and while his playing days are far in the past and it has been years since he last picked up a ball, the five-time MVP said he misses the game dearly.\"Love it like you wouldn't believe,\" Jordan said. \"In all honesty, I wish I could take a magic pill, put on shorts and go out and play the game of basketball today. Because that's who I am. That type of competition, that type of competitiveness is what I live for. I miss it. I miss that aspect of playing the game of basketball. Being able to challenge myself against what people see as great basketball. But it's better for me to be sitting here talking to you as opposed to popping my Achilles and I'm in a wheelchair for a while.\"\nWith playing out of the equation, Jordan embraced a different method to return to the game. He said that professional athletes have an obligation to pay it forward to future generations. Jordan is far from the only big-name athlete to take on a prominent role in broadcasting in recent years, but his status as arguably the greatest to ever dribble a ball gives his position immense gravity.\n            ",

    "body": "\nTottenham Hotspur aim to extend their unbeaten run in the UEFA Champions League on Wednesday as they face Monaco, a match that offers a chance to correct course after some inconsistency in recent weeks.Spurs were unlucky to concede twice against Aston Villa in a 2-1 defeat in Premier League action on Sunday, the opponents notching two goals despite posting just 0.32 expected goals, but have their own attacking issues to sort out against Monaco. Thomas Frank's side currently rank 14th in England's top flight on expected goals with just 8.36 through eight games despite scoring 14 times, at times making up the difference off set pieces and own goals. How sustainable a strategy that is in Frank's first season in charge remains to be seen, though. Only two of their forwards – Richarlison and Brennan Johnson – have three goals this season but Richarlison has not scored in five and Johnson has not notched a goal in the team's last four games.Monaco have not been the picture of consistency, either, though and are winless in their last four games across all competitions. The Ligue 1 side are also searching for their first win of the Champions League season, though they managed to take a point off Manchester City in a 2-2 draw on Matchday 2.Here's what you need to know before tuning in.How to watch Monaco vs. Tottenham Hotspur, oddsDate: Wednesday, Oct. 22 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Stade Louis II -- MonacoLive stream: Paramount+Odds: Monaco +195; Draw +250; Tottenham Hotspur +135Projected lineupsMonaco: Philipp Kohn, Krepin Diatta, Thilo Kehrer, Mohammed Salisu, Kassoum Ouattara, Jordan Teze, Mamadou Coulibaly, Maghnes Akliouche, Ansu Fati, Caio Henrique, Mika BierethTottenham Hotspur: Guglielmo Vicario, Pedro Porro, Kevin Danso, Micky van de Ven, Djed Spence, Joao Palhinha, Lucas Bergvall, Mohammed Kudus, Xavi Simons, Wilson Odobert, RicharlisonPredictionA game between a middling side in Monaco and a team that finds goals somewhat hard to come by in Spurs may not be terribly riveting, so expect a modest scoreline on Wednesday. Even as the visitors have plenty of attacking issues to work out, though, the set piece tricks will always come in handy and may be just enough to take all three points home on Matchday 3 and keep themselves in good standing in the league phase.

Alonso has reimagined Los Blancos as a more restrained but efficient team in his first season in charge, though the showstopping moments have almost been reserved for one person entirely – Kylian Mbappe. He has been the focal point of Alonso's tactical rebuild with 16 goals in 14 games across all competitions, backed up by a rotating cast of attacking characters. He is expected to be the star of the show against Juventus but who will join him is a big question; Alonso has opted to rotate through his options, at times leaving Vinicius Junior to start games on the bench.Juventus, meanwhile, are in the midst of an up-and-down season and are winless in their last six. The task of looking for their first Champions League win of the season, then, might just be an uphill battle against an in-form Real Madrid.Here's what you need to know before tuning in.How to watch Real Madrid vs. Juventus, oddsDate: Wednesday, Oct. 22 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Santiago Bernabeu Stadium -- Madrid, SpainLive stream: Paramount+Odds: Real Madrid -230; Draw +370; Juventus +600Projected lineupsReal Madrid: Thibaut Courtois, Federico Valverde, Raul Asencio, Eder Militao, Alvaro Carreras, Arda Guler, Aurelien Tchouameni, Jude Bellingham, Franco Mastantuono, Kylian Mbappe, Vinicius JuniorJuventus: Michele Di Gregorio, Federico Gatti, Daniele Rugani, Lloyd Kelly, Pierre Kalulu, Weston McKennie, Teun Koopmeiners, Andrea Cambiaso, Kenan Yildiz, Jonathan David, Francisco ConceicaoPredictionThis match is Real Madrid's to lose and there is little reason to believe they will. Mbappe is firing on all cylinders, taking nicely to his new role as the go-to player up top, and Alonso has a wide range of attackers at his disposal to support the France international. No matter the combination of players on the field, expect Los Blancos to show their full might against an inconsistent Juventus and extend their perfect start to Champions League play this season.

    "body": "\n        Luka Dončić stuffed the stat sheet to the tune of 43 points, 12 rebounds, nine assists, two steals and a block on Tuesday, and his Lakers still lost to the Warriors, 119-109, on opening night as Dončić finished as a minus-eight for the game.Putting up numbers like that and still losing is deliciously ripe for overreaction in Lakers land. So let's do it! And let's start with the fact that J.J. Redick had to play Dončić 40 minutes, which is not ideal in any regular-season game -- let alone on opening night -- in a league obsessed with load managing its stars' mileage. Such is life without LeBron James, who's out until at least mid-November as he deals with this sciatica situation and the Lakers simply don't have much else to turn to on a nightly basis. Yes, Austin Reaves went for 26, but that's also a lot to ask of him every night. And even if he does, against the good teams, two guys is not enough. Bottom line: You simply cannot rely on two dudes combining for 69 points, 18 assists and 17 rebounds while logging a combined 76 minutes, especially if you're still losing the game. Those are not sustainable numbers through any lens. \nBeyond that, there's no sense in regurgitating the box score from one game. No doubt the Lakers will get more from the likes of Rui Hachimura and hopefully Gabe Vincent and Deandre Ayton, the latter of whom Lakers fans have spent the summer convincing themselves can suddenly become a player he hasn't been in a half decade. Nevertheless, as one-game evals go, Dončić   having to go hero mode for 40 minutes just to stay within striking distance is kind of a poisonous recipe. Will Redick back off his minutes? Can he afford to until LeBron returns? \"Every game is different,\" Redick said of Dončić's workload against the Warriors. \"I'm not concerned about that.\"\nRedick is right. Every game is different. Which is why Luka can't be expected to produce at this level every night. And he won't have to as soon as LeBron gets back, right? That's interesting. At some point LeBron is not going to be, you know, LeBron. Honestly, can the Lakers even depend on James to pop right back into All-NBA mode at almost 41 years old and already ailing? Truth is, even when LeBron comes back, he simply can't be expected to play more than 50 games at this stage. Maybe he will. It's surely possible. But if you're planning realistically, you have to be prepared to be without him for a decent amount of time, and the initial returns on his absence weren't great. The upside, of course, is Luka was great. He only made two of his 10 3-pointers, but he was in do-everything mode and, as usual, getting to any spot he wanted on the floor as he registered the highest scoring output in a season opener for any Lakers player since Kobe Bryant put 45 on the Rockets to begin the 2007-08 campaign. \nIf Dončić is going to make a run at his first MVP, his case is going to have to start being built in these early non-LeBron games as he aims to keep the Lakers afloat. It's almost a guarantee he's going to put up massive stats, but can enough of the supporting staff step up their game to make it matter? Can Redick avoid the temptation to run Dončić into the ground? If it gets desperate enough, he might have to. Right now, obviously nothing is desperate. It's one game against a very good Warriors team, who were operating close to full strength (Moses Moody and De'Anthony Melton were out). But it was a glimpse into life without LeBron, and despite how well Dončić played, it wasn't such a pretty picture for the Lakers. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Chelsea may still be picking up red cards with three in their last five matches, but they're beginning to find their form under Ezno Maresca. There were wobbles as Cole Palmer has missed time with a groin injury, and the Englishman still won't be available for their Champions League clash hosting Ajax, but their form is changing. With a victory, Maresca's squad will have won four matches in a row since losing to Brighton, while also being in a good position to advance from the league phase.How to watch Chelsea vs. Ajax, oddsDate: Wednesday, Oct. 22 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Stamford Bridge -- London, England Live stream: Paramount+Odds: Chelsea -450; Draw +550; Ajax +1000While strikers have been rotated for the club, Pedro Neto and Reece James have stepped up. Neto delivered a goal and assist over the weekend, while James has a goal and two assists in his last four matches. Slotted in at right back or coming into midfield, James has been able to show why, when healthy, he's one of the best right backs in the Premier League. Following Trent Alexander-Arnold's departure from Liverpool to join Real Madrid, James has a strong case as the best right back in the league. With the club struggling without their talisman, it's important for their captain to step up to fill in the gaps, and James has done just that. The expectation will be for Chelsea to win with ease after Ajax fell to Marseille last time out, but with Joao Pedro suspended for the match, more changes will be needed up top. Marc Guiu was recalled from loan at Sunderland when Nicolas Jackson was loaned to Bayern Munich on transfer deadline day, so the expectation would be that he starts this game, but Tyrique George could also be in contention if Maresca doesn't opt to play a false nine, putting Neto up top. That possible inexperience leading the line will be Ajax's best hope in getting any points at Stamford Bridge.\nIt has been quite a fall from the Ajax side, who used to be regulars in the Champions League round of 16. Currently at the bottom of the league phase table with six goals conceded in two matches played and none scored, they'll need quite a performance to get anything from Chelsea. Even in the Eredivisie, Ajax are fourth in the table under manager John Heitinga. A club in search of their former glory, getting a result off of the Blues may be unlikely, but Chelsea's depth issues could open the door.PredictionThis isn't the Ajax of dominance -- it's far from it, and despite the lack of attacking depth, Chelsea get it done.

    "body": "\n        Las Vegas Raiders wide receiver Jakobi Meyers requested a trade in the offseason, and while the team did not move him before the season started, nothing has changed with regard to his desire to play elsewhere. Meyers said ahead of Week 8 that he \"for sure\" still wants to be traded, even though the Raiders reportedly had no interest in shipping him off at the start of the year.The NFL trade deadline is just over two weeks away, and there is still seemingly no momentum in a potential Meyers deal. A number of teams could benefit from adding the veteran receiver if he becomes available ahead of the Nov. 4 deadline, though. Wideout-needy teams like the New York Giants and Pittsburgh Steelers could be buyers, and the New England Patriots are familiar with Meyers and could potentially use another weapon for breakout quarterback Drake Maye.\"I'm a professional at the end of the day,\" Meyers said Tuesday. \"I'm just trying to play good football. If I'm here, like I said, I'll play good football. If I'm not here, I'll go out there and play wherever I'm supposed to be.\"\n        \n            \n                Jakobi Meyers landing spots: Where could veteran WR wind up if Raiders trade him before deadline?\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMeyers' August trade request came after his search for a new contract came up short. He is in the final season of a three-year deal he signed with the Raiders in 2023, and his stock could not have been higher in the offseason as he was fresh off a career year in which he racked up 87 catches for 1,027 yards and four touchdowns.\nThe sides did not reach an agreement on an extension before the season began, halting the discussions.\"That window kind of closed when the offseason ended,\" Meyers said. \"I'm just focused on being where my feet are. If it gets done, I don't care, for real. I just want to be in a good spot for me, for my family, and like I said, really just play good football.\"The Raiders, who are 2-5 and in last place in the AFC West, will have to determine how expendable Meyers is before making a decision on whether to trade him at the deadline, to re-sign him before or during free agency or to let him walk at the end of the year. With the offense struggling under first-year coach Pete Carroll, Meyers has not been quite the leader of the wideouts that he was last year when he finished second only to tight end Brock Bowers in receiving, but he still ranks in a tie for first place on the team with 29 catches.\nFellow receiver Tre Tucker emerged as the Raiders' most productive pass-catcher from both a yardage and touchdown standpoint with Bowers missing time this season due to injury.\n            ",

For starters, Jameis Winston is back as the quarterback for the Giants with Jaxson Dart (concussion) hurt, and he's always worth watching, even in a tough matchup at Green Bay.   We also have the potential game of the season with Seattle at the Rams, and there are other great matchups with Tampa Bay at Buffalo, Kansas City at Denver and Detroit at Philadelphia. These games could impact the NFL playoffs in a major way.   The Fantasy playoffs are also getting close, and managers are hoping to get their rosters right. We'll do our best to help, and this should be a great week for Fantasy quarterbacks, as you'll read about below.   The rookie running backs are also ready to make a significant impact, especially TreVeyon Henderson and Woody Marks, who are both worth starting in Week 11. And RJ Harvey might be ready to help Fantasy managers in a big way with J.K. Dobbins (foot) banged up.   At receiver, we don't have Marvin Harrison Jr. (appendix) for Week 11, but hopefully other receivers are ready to step up for Fantasy managers like Tez Johnson, Jauan Jennings and Wan'Dale Robinson, who could be awesome with Winston.   We'll also have you covered at tight end, DST and kicker. I can't wait for Week 11 to start, and I hope your Fantasy teams will be successful in this scoring period.   \nPick NFL at Underdog Fantasy, where new users who play $5 now get $100 in site credits with promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.

I like Herbert as a top-five Fantasy quarterback in this matchup, especially since it appears like Oronde Gadsden II (quadriceps) will play. The Jaguars are No. 3 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing quarterbacks, and six quarterbacks in a row have scored at least 21.7 Fantasy points, including three in a row with at least 31.7 points (Matthew Stafford, Geno Smith and Davis Mills). Herbert scored at least 22.8 Fantasy points in four games in a row prior to facing the Steelers, and I expect him to get back on track in this game. He should go into his bye in Week 12 on a high note with a big game against the Jaguars.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    START 'EM & SIT

In his career, he has played eight games after a bye (he missed the 2020 game post-bye because of an ankle injury), and he is averaging 26.8 Fantasy points in those contests, including three outings with at least 31.3 points. Prior to this year's bye in Week 10, Prescott struggled in two games against Denver and Arizona for a combined 24.2 Fantasy points, but he should rebound on Monday night at Las Vegas. Five quarterbacks this season have scored at least 21.2 Fantasy points against the Raiders, including two in the past three games. I like Prescott as a top-five quarterback in this matchup.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        LAR\n                    \n                         \n                        L.A.

He comes into Week 11 having scored at least 31.6 Fantasy points in five of his past six games, including three in a row at home, and the one outing where he failed to reach that mark was in Week 6 at Baltimore when Puka Nacua injured his ankle. Seattle's defense is tough, but five quarterbacks this season have scored at least 20.1 Fantasy points. I don't expect Stafford to have a dominant performance in this matchup, but he should still finish as a top-10 Fantasy quarterback in Week 11.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        TB\n                    \n                         \n                        Tampa Bay\n                    \n                                            • #6\n                                            \n                                            Age: 30\n                                                                        • Experience: 8 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        BUF\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    BUF -5.5\n                                    O/U 48\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS QB\n                                \n                                4th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                21.6\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    QB RNK\n                                \n                                13th\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        PAYDS\n                                    \n                                    2192\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    158\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    16\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INT\n                                    \n                                    2\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    21.7\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                The Bills are No. 4 in fewest Fantasy points allowed to opposing quarterbacks, so I can understand some trepidation to start Mayfield in Week 11 on the road. And while Buffalo did well in holding Drake Maye and Patrick Mahomes to 12.1 Fantasy points or less, the Bills have padded their resume with locking down Justin Fields, Tua Tagovailoa twice, Spencer Rattler, Michael Penix Jr. and Andy Dalton. Mayfield has actually done well in tough matchups this season at Atlanta (28.6 Fantasy points), at Houston (23.9), vs. Philadelphia (22.9), at Seattle (30.7) and vs. New England (28.9). I'm going to trust him as a No. 1 quarterback in this game, which is projected to be the highest-scoring total of the week at 49.5 points. Hopefully, we get a shootout with Mayfield and Josh Allen.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        CHI\n                    \n                         \n                        Chicago\n                    \n                                            • #18\n                                            \n                                            Age: 23\n                                                                        • Experience: 2 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        MIN\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    MIN -3\n                                    O/U 48.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS QB\n                                \n                                17th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                19.5\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    QB RNK\n                                \n                                12th\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        PAYDS\n                                    \n                                    2136\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    246\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    17\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INT\n                                    \n                                    4\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    23.1\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Williams is hot coming into Week 11, having scored at least 27.1 Fantasy points in each of his past two games against Cincinnati and the Giants. Those were incredible matchups, but Williams also scored 26.2 Fantasy points against Minnesota in Week 1. He had 210 passing yards and one touchdown and 58 rushing yards and a touchdown in that first meeting with the Vikings, and he might need to use his legs again in the rematch. Good thing for Fantasy managers that Williams has rushed for 116 yards and a touchdown combined against the Bengals and Giants in the past two weeks. Minnesota also has allowed four of the past five quarterbacks to score at least 20.1 Fantasy points, and I like Williams as a top-10 Fantasy option in Week 11.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n

 \n                    \n                It's incredible to think that Flacco passed for 342 yards and three touchdowns against Pittsburgh in Week 7, and that wasn't even his best start in just four appearances for the Bengals this season. In his last game against Chicago in Week 9, Flacco had 470 passing yards, four touchdowns and two interceptions, and he is averaging 30.4 Fantasy points during his tenure in Cincinnati, which is amazing. We know his time as a starter might be coming to an end since Joe Burrow (toe) could return as early as Week 13. But in Week 11, start Flacco with confidence against the Steelers, who have allowed five quarterbacks this season to score at least 23.2 Fantasy points.\n            \n            \n\nSleepers

exceptional this season in reality, but we've seen him have some down Fantasy games, including scoring 10.6 points or less in two of his past three outings, with six turnovers over that span. He also has scored fewer than 20 Fantasy points in five of nine games this season. The Rams have only allowed three games this season where a quarterback has scored more than 20 Fantasy points, which were Jalen Hurts and Mac Jones twice. Granted, they haven't faced a gauntlet of quarterbacks since their other opponents were C.J. Stroud, Cam Ward, Daniel Jones, Cooper Rush and Tyler Shough. But I can see Darnold once again being under 20 Fantasy points in Week 11, and I would only start him in Superflex and two-quarterback leagues.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n

added minus-2 rushing yards. He scored 7.8 Fantasy points, which snapped his three-game streak of scoring at least 22.5 points, but his performance in reality hasn't been equal to his Fantasy production for most of the season. This week, Nix should struggle against the Chiefs, who are No. 10 in fewest Fantasy points allowed to opposing quarterbacks, and only two guys have thrown multiple touchdowns against this defense. Last year, in one competitive game against Kansas City in Week 10 (the Chiefs rested their starters in Week 18), Nix scored 20.1 Fantasy points. But I wouldn't trust him in this matchup, and he's only worth starting in Superflex and two-quarterback leagues.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        JAC\n                    \n                         \n                        Jacksonville\n                    \n                                            • #16\n                                            \n                                            Age: 26\n                                                                        • Experience: 5 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        LAC\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    LAC -3\n                                    O/U 43.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS QB\n                                \n                                3rd\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                17.5\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                    \n                                \n                                    QB RNK\n                                \n                                NR\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        PAYDS\n                                    \n                                    1998\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    172\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    14\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INT\n                                    \n                                    7\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    18.1\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Lawrence struggled as expected in Week 10 at Houston with 11.8 Fantasy points, and he should have another down game in Week 11. We'll see if Brian Thomas Jr. (ankle) can play in this matchup, but even with Thomas, Lawrence should struggle against Los Angeles. The Chargers are No. 3 in fewest Fantasy points allowed to opposing quarterbacks, and Daniel Jones is the lone quarterback with multiple passing touchdowns against this defense. Lawrence is only worth starting in Superflex and two-quarterback leagues.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        NYJ\n                    \n                         \n                        N.Y.

But New England should be able to limit the production for Fields, who has scored 8.9 Fantasy points or less in three of his past four games. Garrett Wilson (knee) is out in Week 11, and Fields doesn't have any reliable weapons to boost his stats. I have a hard time recommending Fields in Superflex and two-quarterback leagues in Week 11, but those are the only formats he should be considered in this matchup.\n            \n            \n\nBust

But this should be a tough matchup for him at the Eagles, who are No. 8 in fewest Fantasy points allowed to opposing quarterbacks. Only two quarterbacks have thrown multiple touchdowns against Philadelphia this season and none since Week 4. The Eagles have also allowed just one touchdown and two interceptions in their past three games against Carson Wentz, Jaxson Dart and Jordan Love. Goff is obviously better than that trio, but I wouldn't expect a big game from him in Week 11. He's only worth starting in Superflex and two-quarterback leagues.\n            \n            \n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    START 'EM & SIT 'EM\n                \n

Patriots, and Henderson has looked awesome in his place. He had 14 carries for 55 yards and four catches for 32 yards on six targets in Week 9 against Atlanta, and he scored 12.7 PPR points. Then came the breakout performance at Tampa Bay in Week 10 with 14 carries for 147 yards and two touchdowns, and one catch for 3 yards on one target. He could have the chance for another dominant outing against the Jets, who have allowed seven running backs to score at least 13.9 PPR points this season. I like Henderson as a No. 1 Fantasy running back in all leagues in Week 11.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n

and Kyle Monangai in Week 10 against the Giants after Swift missed Week 9 at Cincinnati with a groin injury, and Monangai had a dominant game against the Bengals with 198 total yards on 29 total touches. Against the Giants, Swift out-touched Monangai 18-7, and Swift finished the game with 13 carries for 80 yards and five catches for 18 yards on eight targets, while Monangai had seven carries for 28 yards and a touchdown and no catches on one target. Monangai is clearly going to have a role, but Swift should continue to lead the backfield. He's worth using as a No. 2 Fantasy running back in all leagues, and Swift has scored at least 14.8 PPR points in five games in a row prior to Week 11. He only scored 9.5 PPR points against Minnesota in Week 1, which was his worst game of the season. But the Vikings have allowed six running backs this season to score at least 13 PPR points, and I expect Swift to post a solid stat line in the rematch.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        CIN\n                    \n                         \n                        Cincinnati\n                    \n                                            • #30\n                                            \n                                            Age: 25\n                                                                        • Experience: 3 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        PIT\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    PIT -5.5\n                                    O/U 49.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS RB\n                                \n                                8th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                12.9\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    RB RNK\n                                \n                                16th\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    420\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    33\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    201\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    3\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    12.9\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Brown was having an awful Fantasy season prior to facing the Steelers in Week 7. He had one touchdown through Week 6, and his best rushing performance was 47 yards in Week 2 against Jacksonville. But things changed for him against Pittsburgh when he had 11 carries for 108 yards and two catches for minus-8 yards on four targets. He scored 12 PPR points in that game, and he followed that up with 25.5 PPR points against the Jets in Week 8 and 19.2 PPR points against Chicago in Week 9. I expect him to keep the momentum going in the rematch with the Steelers, who have allowed three running backs in the past four games to score at least 12 PPR points. I doubt Brown will hit the century mark again in the rematch, but I hope he remains involved in the passing game. In his past two outings against the Jets and Bears, he has 11 catches for 107 yards and a touchdown on 17 targets. Samaje Perine (ankle) could also be out in Week 11, which is a boost for Brown, who should be considered a No. 2 Fantasy running back in all leagues.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n

11. He's worth using as a No. 2 Fantasy running back in all leagues. Marks has scored at least 12.5 PPR points in three of his past four games coming into this game, and he appeared to finally take over the Houston backfield in Week 10 when he played a season-high 80 percent of the snaps against Jacksonville. He finished the game with 14 carries for 63 yards and a touchdown and two catches for 18 yards on three targets. Tennessee is No. 5 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing running backs, and a running back has scored at least 16.6 PPR points against the Titans in six of their past seven games.\n            \n

targets. It was his first rushing touchdown of the season, and he scored 15.9 PPR points. He should have a solid encore performance in Week 11 against Chicago, and he loves facing the Bears. He had eight carries for 23 yards and three catches for 44 yards and a touchdown on three targets at Chicago in Week 1, and Jones has averaged 18.1 PPR points against the Bears in his past 13 meetings against Chicago during his time with Green Bay and Minnesota. The Bears have allowed seven running backs this season to score at least 13.1 PPR points, and I like Jones as a No. 2 Fantasy option in all leagues in Week 11.\n            \n            \n\nSleepers

    Harvey should be headed for a big role in Week 11 against Kansas City with J.K. Dobbins (foot) injured, and hopefully, Harvey takes advantage of this opportunity. He has one game this season with double digits in touches, which was Week 4 against Cincinnati, and he had 14 carries for 58 yards and four catches for 40 yards and a touchdown on five targets for 19.8 PPR points. The upside is immense, and we've seen him excel as a pass catcher recently with three receiving touchdowns in his past four games. Keep in mind the Broncos can still limit Harvey's touches and have him share work with Tyler Badie or even Jaleel McLaughlin. But that duo has combined for 13 total touches this season, so it should be the Harvey show. Since this is a difficult matchup against the Chiefs, who are No. 7 in fewest Fantasy points allowed to opposing running backs, I wouldn't overvalue Harvey. But he should be considered a flex option in Week 11, given the expected (hopeful) increase in touches with Dobbins hurt.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        KC\n                    \n                         \n                        Kansas City\n                    \n                                            • #29\n                                            \n                                            Age: 30\n                                                                        • Experience: 9 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        DEN\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    KC -3.5\n                                    O/U 44.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS RB\n                                \n                                5th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                9.3\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    RB RNK\n                                \n                                26th\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    294\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    9\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    63\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    6\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    9\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                It doesn't appear like Isiah Pacheco (knee) will play in Week 11 at Denver, which should keep Hunt in a prominent role for the Chiefs. In Week 9 at Buffalo, with Pacheco out, Hunt had 11 carries for 49 yards and a touchdown and one catch for 6 yards on two targets. He has now scored at least 12.5 PPR points in three of his past five games, and he's worth using as a flex option against the Broncos. Even though Denver is No. 5 in fewest Fantasy points allowed to opposing running backs, three guys have scored at least 15.3 PPR points against the Broncos in their past four games, with five total touchdowns over that span.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        ARI\n

(knee) still on injured reserve, as well as Zonovan Knight (ankle) banged up. Michael Carter will also be a factor for the Cardinals, but Demercado has more upside heading into this game. He had 14 carries for 79 yards and one catch for minus-1 yard in Week 9 at Dallas, and then he had four carries for 64 yards and three catches for 40 yards on four targets in Week 10 at Seattle. The 49ers have allowed six running backs to score at least 15.1 PPR points in their past seven games, and I like Demercado as a flex option in this matchup.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        ATL\n                    \n                         \n                        Atlanta\n                    \n                                            • #25\n                                            \n                                            Age: 25\n                                                                        • Experience: 4 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        CAR\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    ATL -3.5\n                                    O/U 42.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS RB\n                                \n                                16th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                7.3\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    RB RNK\n                                \n                                31st\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    270\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    5\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    20\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    6\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    7.8\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Allgeier comes into Week 11 against Carolina having scored a rushing touchdown in four of his past six games. In Week 10 at Indianapolis in Berlin, Allgeier had 11 carries for 57 yards and two touchdowns, and he scored 17.7 PPR points. His production has been a problem for Bijan Robinson, but Fantasy managers looking for a flex option in Week 11 can lean on Allgeier. The Panthers have allowed three rushing touchdowns in their past three games, and Allgeier should be a candidate to score in this matchup, especially if the Falcons are playing with a lead late in the

  \n                    \n                Walker had another frustrating Fantasy outing in Week 10 against Arizona with 14 carries for 67 yards and one catch for 3 yards on one target. He's now scored 8.1 PPR points or less in four games in a row, and he hasn't scored a touchdown since Week 3. Over that same span, Zach Charbonnet has scored five touchdowns, and even third-stringer George Holani got into the end zone against the Cardinals last week. This week, Walker has to face the Rams, who are No. 1 in fewest Fantasy points allowed to opposing running backs. The Rams have allowed one rushing touchdown to a running back this season, and Walker is a flex option at best in the majority of leagues in this matchup.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n

the majority of leagues. But even if Irving is out again in Week 11 at Buffalo, then you should only use White as a flex option, with his value higher in PPR. Sean Tucker has looked better than White in the past two games against New Orleans and New England, with 21 carries for 95 yards and a touchdown over that span, compared to 23 carries for 73 yards for White. Tucker could be gaining momentum, while White has struggled with two games in his past three outings at 8.4 PPR points or less. I like that White had five catches on five targets in Week 10 against New England, but he only managed 16 receiving yards. He also hasn't scored a touchdown since Week 6. While the matchup is positive against the Bills, who are No. 7 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing running backs, it might be Tucker who is taking advantage of it and not White.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        NYG\n                    \n                         \n                        N.Y.

The offense has the chance to be explosive with Winston under center, but I'm not sure that will benefit Tracy, who is just a flex option at best in deeper leagues. In two games without Cam Skattebo (ankle), Tracy has combined for 19 carries for 89 yards, which is a positive, but he has no touchdowns and just four catches for 19 yards on six targets. Over that same span, Devin Singletary had 16 carries for 63 yards and five catches for 61 yards on five targets. Singletary should continue to get more work in the passing game, and we'll see what happens at the goal line. This is also a difficult matchup against the Packers, who are No. 6 in fewest Fantasy points allowed to opposing running backs. I would start Singletary ahead of Tracy in the majority of leagues, but I'd like to avoid both if possible against Green Bay.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        TEN\n                    \n                         \n                        Tennessee\n                    \n                                            • #20\n                                            \n                                            Age: 28\n                                                                        • Experience: 7 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        HOU\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    HOU -6.5\n                                    O/U 37.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS RB\n                                \n                                10th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                7.9\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    RB RNK\n                                \n                                35th\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    480\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    19\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    143\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    2\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    9.9\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Pollard went into his bye in Week 10 having scored a combined 14.1 PPR points against the Colts and Chargers, and he continues to lose work to Tyjae Spears. Over that same span, Spears scored 26.4 PPR points, and I would rather start Spears over Pollard if given the choice. Ideally, you should sit both against the Texans, who are No. 10 in fewest Fantasy points allowed to opposing running backs. Pollard faced Houston in Week 4 when Spears was still out with an ankle injury and had 14 carries for 64 yards and three catches for 12 yards on three targets. He scored 10.6 PPR points in that matchup, and we would love it for Pollard to reach even that level of production. At best, he's a flex option in the majority of leagues in Week 11.\n            \n            \n\nBust Alert (Start/Sit)\n                        Projections powered by\n                        \n

PPR points, he's only averaging 8.8 PPR points in his past four games against the Chiefs, Buccaneers, Vikings, and Commanders, with one touchdown over that span. We know Montgomery needs to score a touchdown to help Fantasy managers -- he's been at 40 rushing yards or less in three of his past four games and has two catches or less in all but one game this season -- and the Eagles have allowed eight rushing touchdowns on the season. But this feels like a Jahmyr Gibbs game on the road, and Montgomery is only worth using as a flex option in the majority of leagues. I hope he finds the end zone, but it could be another empty stat line if he fails to score.\n            \n            \n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    START 'EM & SIT

Brown said on a live stream Tuesday night that \"if you got me in Fantasy, get rid of me.\" We're not ready to do that yet, but it is time to consider Smith the best Eagles receiver heading into Week 11 -- and maybe the rest of the season. Smith has scored at least 14.4 PPR points in three games in a row and four times in his past five outings. The Lions have allowed seven receivers to score at least 13.2 PPR points this season, and Smith should be considered a solid No. 2 Fantasy receiver in the majority of leagues.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        DAL\n                    \n                         \n                        Dallas\n                    \n                                            • #3\n                                            \n                                            Age: 24\n                                                                        • Experience: 4 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        LV\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    DAL -3.5\n                                    O/U 50.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS WR\n                                \n                                27th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                14.5\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    WR RNK\n                                \n                                15th\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    49\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    72\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    764\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    6\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    17.9\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Pickens went into his bye in Week 10 with consecutive games of nine targets against Denver and Arizona. He scored 14.8 PPR points against the Broncos in Week 8 and 13.9 PPR points against the Cardinals in Week 9, and hopefully that's the floor for his production in Week 11 at the Raiders. Pickens hasn't scored a touchdown in the past three games since CeeDee Lamb returned from his ankle injury, so he's due. And the Raiders are No. 6 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing receivers with 10 touchdowns allowed, and nine guys have scored at least 14.6 PPR points against Las Vegas this season. Pickens should be considered a solid No. 2 Fantasy receiver in the majority of leagues.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        SF\n                    \n                         \n                        San Francisco\n                    \n                                            • #15\n                                            \n                                            Age: 28\n                                                                        • Experience: 5 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        ARI\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    SF -3\n                                    O/U 48.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS WR\n                                \n                                16th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                9.8\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    WR RNK\n                                \n                                23rd\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    28\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    50\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    324\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    3\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    9.8\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Jennings is on a hot streak heading into Week 11 at Arizona, and he's worth using as a No. 2 Fantasy receiver in the majority of leagues. He has scored at least 14.1 PPR points in each of his past two games against the Giants and Rams, and he has 10 catches for 112 yards and two touchdowns on 14 targets over that span. Jennings missed the first game against the Cardinals in Week 3, but Ricky Pearsall had eight catches for 117 yards on 11 targets in that matchup. And Arizona has allowed at least one receiver to score at least 12.4 PPR points in every game this season, with 11 total receivers reaching that mark this year. Jennings should have the chance for his third game in a row with quality production in this matchup.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        TB\n                    \n                         \n                        Tampa Bay\n                    \n                                            • #15\n                                            \n                                            Age: 23\n                                                                        • Experience: Rookie\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        BUF\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    BUF -5.5\n                                    O/U 48\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS WR\n                                \n                                13th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                10.6\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    WR RNK\n                                \n                                32nd\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    19\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    30\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    255\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    4\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    8.6\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Johnson has scored at least 15.8 PPR points in two of his past three games, and he should continue to play a prominent role for the Buccaneers while Mike Evans (collarbone) and Chris Godwin (leg) are out. He has 20 targets in his past three outings, and he scored three touchdowns over that span. Now, he's yet to eclipse five catches or 58 receiving yards in any of those games, but this could be a shootout at Buffalo in Week 11. And the Bills have allowed a pair of receivers to score a touchdown in the same game three times this season, which bodes well for Johnson and Emeka Egbuka. I like Johnson as a No. 2 Fantasy receiver in the majority of leagues.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        NE\n                    \n                         \n                        New England\n                    \n                                            • #8\n                                            \n                                            Age: 31\n                                                                        • Experience: 11 year\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        NYJ\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    NE -12.5\n                                    O/U 43.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS WR\n                                \n                                12th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                12.8\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    WR RNK\n                                \n                                21st\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    50\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    61\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    554\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    3\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    12.3\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Diggs has scored a touchdown in three games in a row heading into Week 11 against the Jets, and he has scored at least 12.8 PPR points four times in his past six outings.

against Kansas City with 10.7 PPR points or less in three games in a row. During that stretch, he only has eight catches for 121 yards and one touchdown on 16 targets, and he's been outplayed by Troy Franklin, who has 15 catches for 156 yards and three touchdowns on 27 targets over that span. I would actually play Franklin over Sutton against the Chiefs, but both are just No. 3 Fantasy receivers in the majority of leagues. Kansas City is No. 6 in fewest Fantasy points allowed to opposing receivers, and the Chiefs have surrendered just three touchdowns to the position since Week 1. I'm hopeful Sutton will snap out of his recent slump, but he's tough to trust in this matchup in Week 11.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        WAS\n                    \n                         \n                        Washington\n                    \n                                            • #1\n                                            \n                                            Age: 29\n                                                                        • Experience: 7 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        MIA\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    MIA -2.5\n                                    O/U 47.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS WR\n                                \n                                5th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                13.2\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    WR RNK\n                                \n                                26th\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    46\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    60\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    396\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    5\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    13.4\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                It was good to see Samuel score a touchdown in Week 10 against Detroit, but he only had four catches for 29 yards on five targets in that game. He now has four starts with Marcus Mariota, and Samuel has three games with fewer than 30 receiving yards over that span. This week in Madrid, Samuel is facing a Dolphins secondary that is No. 5 in fewest Fantasy points allowed to opposing receivers. Miami has only allowed two touchdowns to receivers in the past four games, and Samuel will likely have an empty stat line if he doesn't score. I would only use Samuel in three-receiver leagues in Week 11.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        KC\n                    \n                         \n                        Kansas City\n                    \n                                            • #1\n                                            \n                                            Age: 22\n                                                                        • Experience: 2 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        DEN\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    KC -4\n                                    O/U 44.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS WR\n                                \n                                2nd\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                9.1\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    WR RNK\n                                \n                                37th\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    24\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    40\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    256\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    1\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    9\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Since Rashee Rice returned from his six-game suspension, Worthy has struggled to produce for Fantasy managers with a combined 24.1 PPR points over that span, with no touchdowns. He does have seven targets in each of his past two games against Washington and Buffalo, but Worthy is too tough to trust now that Rice is back on the field. And this week, Worthy should be used in only deep, three-receiver leagues at Denver. The Broncos are No. 1 in fewest Fantasy points allowed to opposing receivers, and this secondary should make things tough on Worthy, even if cornerback Patrick Surtain II (pectoral) remains out.\n

That's not the type of production you want to chase for Moore, who has scored 9.6 PPR points or less in six games this season. He was held to three catches for 68 yards on five targets in Week 1 against Minnesota, and he just had no catches on four targets in Week 10 against the Giants. Moore is also dealing with a shoulder injury, which is worth monitoring heading into Week 11. I would only use Moore in deep, three-receiver leagues in the rematch with the Vikings.\n            \n            \n\nBust Alert (Start/Sit)\n                        Projections powered by\n

Fantasy receiver at best in Week 11 against the Falcons, who held him to three catches for 48 yards on eight targets in Week 3. McMillan has one game this season with a touchdown, which was Week 6 against Dallas. And he's scored 11 PPR points or less in three of his past four games. Atlanta is No. 8 in fewest Fantasy points allowed to opposing receivers, and No. 1 receivers like Mike Evans (10.1 PPR points), Justin Jefferson (11.1), Jauan Jennings (7.1) and Michael Pittman (3.9) have struggled against the Falcons, who are led by standout cornerback A.J.

That's great news since the Jaguars are No. 2 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing tight ends. A tight end has scored at least 10.1 PPR points against Jacksonville in six games in a row, and Gadsden had scored at least 11.8 PPR points in four games in a row prior to Week 10. He should be considered a No. 1 Fantasy tight end in all leagues as long as he's cleared to play.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        TB\n                    \n                         \n                        Tampa Bay\n                    \n                                            • #88\n                                            \n                                            Age: 26\n                                                                        • Experience: 4 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        BUF\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    BUF -5.5\n                                    O/U 48\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS TE\n                                \n                                1st\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                11.7\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    TE RNK\n                                \n                                4th\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    35\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    48\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    353\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    0\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    7.8\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                The Bills are No. 1 in fewest Fantasy points allowed to opposing tight ends, but I'm still starting Otton in the majority of leagues in Week 11. He's scored at least 10.1 PPR points in four of his past five games, including a huge outing in Week 10 against New England with nine catches for 82 yards on 12 targets. Baker Mayfield will continue to lean on Otton as long as Mike Evans (collarbone) and Chris Godwin (leg) are out, and Otton has at least nine targets in two of his past three outings. He might not have a dominant game given the opponent, but Otton should still be successful given his expected workload from Mayfield.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n

Schultz has now scored at least 13.7 PPR points in three of his past four games after he had a big outing against Jacksonville in Week 10 with seven catches for 53 yards and a touchdown on 11 targets. He only had five catches for 30 yards on six targets in Week 4 against Tennessee, but I expect him to perform better in the rematch. The Titans have allowed two touchdowns to tight ends in their past four games, and four guys over that span have scored at least 9.1 PPR points. Davis Mills appears in line to start again for the Texans with C.J. Stroud (concussion) hurt, and Mills just helped Schultz have his big game against the Jaguars.\n            \n            \n\nSleepers (Start/Sit)\n                        Projections powered by\n

He should have the chance to be in a similar range in Week 11 at Minnesota, and the Vikings have allowed five touchdowns to opposing tight ends in their past five games. D.J. Moore (shoulder) is also banged up for the Bears, and that could help Loveland. He should be considered a low-end starter in the majority of leagues.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        NYG\n                    \n                         \n                        N.Y.

He also has scored five touchdowns during that stretch, and Johnson should benefit with Jameis Winston starting at quarterback for the injured Jaxson Dart (concussion). The Packers have allowed five tight ends to score at least 11 PPR points this season, and Johnson should be considered a low-end starter in the majority of leagues in this matchup.\n            \n

And he took advantage of this matchup in Week 7 with five catches for 111 yards and two touchdowns on six targets. The Steelers also got touchdowns from Jonnu Smith and Darnell Washington in that game, but Freiermuth posted the best stat line. Given the matchup, Freiermuth is worth trusting as a low-end starter in the majority of leagues.\n            \n            \n\nSit Tight Ends\n                        Projections powered by\n                        \n                            Sportsline\n                        \n                    \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        MIN\n                    \n                         \n                        Minnesota\n                    \n                                            • #87\n                                            \n                                            Age: 28\n                                                                        • Experience: 7 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        CHI\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    MIN -3\n                                    O/U 48.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS TE\n                                \n                                24th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                8.1\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                    \n                                \n                                    TE RNK\n                                \n                                NR\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    31\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    41\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    241\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    2\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    7.5\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Hockenson has played four games with J.J. McCarthy this season, and Hockenson has four targets or less in each outing. He's been held to 15 yards or less in each of those games, with one touchdown. There's little reason to trust Hockenson in the majority of leagues heading into Week 11 against Chicago if McCarthy is not going to give him more chances to succeed. And in Week 1 against the Bears, Hockenson only had three catches for 15 yards on four targets.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        DEN\n                    \n                         \n                        Denver\n                    \n                                            • #1\n                                            \n                                            Age: 31\n                                                                        • Experience: 9 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        KC\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    KC -3.5\n                                    O/U 44.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS TE\n                                \n                                7th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                7.6\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    TE RNK\n                                \n                                21st\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    28\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    45\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    227\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    1\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    6.4\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Engram has combined for 3.2 PPR points in his past two games against Houston and Las Vegas with two catches for 12 yards on eight targets. He has scored 7.6 PPR points or less in three games in a row, and Engram is not worth trusting in most leagues in Week 11 against the Chiefs. Kansas City is No. 7 in fewest Fantasy points allowed to opposing tight ends, and only two guys have scored touchdowns against the Chiefs this year.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        NYJ\n                    \n                         \n                        N.Y.

But Taylor has scored 6.1 PPR points or less in three of his past four games, and he just had one catch for 4 yards in Week 10 against Cleveland. It's too hard to trust Taylor with Justin Fields right now, and Taylor is only worth starting in deep, tight-end premium leagues.\n            \n            \n\nBust Alert (Start/Sit)\n                        Projections powered by\n                        \n                            Sportsline\n                        \n                    \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        NYJ\n                    \n                         \n                        N.Y.

Joe Flacco was the Browns quarterback then and not Dillon Gabriel, but Njoku only had four catches for 40 yards on five targets in that first meeting. And while Njoku has scored at least 10.1 PPR points in three of his past four games, I don't like that he only had two catches for 21 yards on two targets in Week 10 at the Jets. Fannin is still worth using as a low-end No. 1 Fantasy tight end, but I would only use Njoku in deeper leagues in this matchup with Baltimore.\n            \n            \n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    START 'EM & SIT 'EM\n                \n                            \n                    DST\n                \n                    \n            DST to StartRavens (at CLE)This hasn't been a good season for Baltimore's defense, but the Ravens are playing better of late. Baltimore has allowed 19 points or less in four games in a row against the Rams, Bears, Dolphins and Vikings, and the Ravens have four interceptions and three fumbles over that span. Cleveland has scored 20 points or less in all but one game this season, and the Browns have allowed 26 sacks on the year. I like the Ravens DST as a top-five Fantasy option in Week 11.SleepersFalcons (vs. CAR)Cowboys (at LV)Dolphins (vs. WAS)DST to SitSeahawks (at LAR)\nThe Seahawks DST was dominant in Week 10 against Arizona with two touchdowns, five sacks and two fumble recoveries. But things should change in Week 11 against the Rams. The Rams have only allowed 14 sacks on the season and just three in the past three games. The Rams have only given up five fumbles and two interceptions and none since Week 6. And the Rams have scored at least 34 points in three games in a row. Hold the Seahawks DST until Week 12 for the matchup at Tennessee. But sit the Seahawks DST in Week 11 at the Rams.\n    \n    \n                            \n                    START 'EM & SIT 'EM\n                \n                            \n

That's one of seven outings with multiple field goals for Pineiro, and he should be considered a top-five Fantasy kicker in Week 11. This is also a great matchup since six kickers have made multiple field goals against Arizona this season, including Jason Myers in Week 10.\n            \n            \nSleepers (Start/Sit)\n

    "body": "\n        Nine divisional games take place in NFL Week 11, the first of which has the New York Jets visiting the New England Patriots on 'Thursday Night Football.' Both squads enter on winning streaks, with New England prevailing for the seventh straight game with a 28-23 road win at Tampa on Sunday. Meanwhile, the Jets have won back-to-back games for the first time in over a calendar year as they knocked off Cleveland, 27-20, in Week 10. New England leads the all-time series 75-56-1. Receiver Garrett Wilson (knee) is out for the Jets. Receiver Kayshon Boutte (hamstring) and running back Rhamondre Stevenson (toe) are out for New England. Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Mass. The Pats have won 13 of their last 14 home games versus the Jets, including a 25-22 win last year. The latest Jets vs. Patriots odds have New England as 12.5-point favorites, the largest line in Week 11. The over/under for total points is 43.5.

It has covered in three of its last four overall and is 3-1 ATS on the road, compared to New England being 2-3 ATS at home. Additionally, New York scored two non-offensive touchdowns in Sunday's win over Cleveland and could have opportunities for more of those on Thursday, considering Drake Maye is sometimes careless with the ball. The second-year quarterback has three interceptions, three fumbles (one lost) and taken 13 sacks over his last three games, while New York has just one giveaway over its last two games. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why the Patriots can coverThe Pats take care of business versus struggling teams as they've covered in all five games against opponents with a winning percentage of .400 or lower. New England is a complete team, ranking eighth in scoring offense and sixth in scoring defense, making it one of three squads to rank in the top eight in both. The strongest unit of the team is its No. 1 run defense, which would mitigate New York's biggest offensive strength and make the Jets one dimensional. Unfortunately for New York, that dimension of the passing game ranks dead last in the league, and the Jets are averaging just 104.8 passing yards over their last four games.

And that's the case once again on Saturday when UFC makes its annual trip to Madison Square Garden for UFC 322. A pair of superfights tip the bill with (now) former champions moving up in weight in pursuit of glory in a second division. In the main event, Islam Makhachev moves up from lightweight to welterweight to challenge Jack Della Maddalena for the 170-pound title. In the co-main, Weili Zhang moves from strawweight to flyweight to face Valentina Shevchenko for the 125-pound crown.Technically, champion vs. champion super fights are a thing of the past because UFC CEO Dana White's new philosophy requires champions to vacate their titles before changing divisions. That's exactly what happened with Makhachev and Zhang, who relinquished their UFC titles to move up in weight and become two-division champions. Makhachev (27-1) set the record for most UFC lightweight title defenses, eclipsing mentor Khabib Nurmagomedov and others, before moving up to challenge Jack Della Maddalena in the latter's first title defense. Della Maddalena inspired some confidence that he can give Makhachev a tough fight after busting up Belal Muhammad to become the 170-pound champion.Zhang Weili dominated women's strawweight before leaving Mackenzie Dern to pick up the vacant strap at UFC 321. Her second reign as champion saw her beat Amanda Lemos, Yan Xiaonan and Tatiana Suarez. Now she seeks to put an end to Shevchenko's second women's flyweight title reign, which Shevchenko kick-started after ending her series with former champ Alexa Grasso.\nThe undercard is loaded with fun fights to get fans excited in New York. Rising welterweights Sean Brady and Michael Morales collide in a featured bout that could set the winner up for a shot at the title soon. The same could be said for the winner of Carlos Prates vs. former titleholder Leon Edwards in another featured bout at welterweight. Plus, veterans Beneil Dariush and Benoit Saint-Denis link up in a lightweight battle that could produce fireworks.Below is the complete fight card for UFC 322, along with the latest odds.

The biggest game of the night is Thunder vs. Lakers in a Western Conference showdown at 9:30 p.m. ET, but college football bettors also have three MACtion games to look forward to at 7 p.m. ET. The Lakers are eight-point underdogs on the road, according to the latest NBA odds. Picks from Lakers vs. Thunder, Pistons vs. Bulls and Miami (OH) vs. Toledo are among our Wednesday best bets at FanDuel Sportsbook from SportsLine's team of experts and the SportsLine Projection Model. Claim the latest FanDuel promo code, which gives new users $150 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: Check out our FanDuel promo code review for full details.The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times.

The RedHawks had their five-game winning streak snapped in a 24-20 loss at Ohio last week, but that setback came on the road. Toledo has been far more inconsistent this season, alternating between wins and losses in seven straight games. The Rockets have lost all four of their road games, so the model has Miami (OH) covering as a home underdog in 62% of simulations. Back the RedHawks at FanDuel Sportsbook:Pistons -2.5 vs. Bulls (-108)\"Not a bad price here on the Pistons, who are demonstrating an admirable \"refuse to lose\" mode after stretching the current win streak to seven with a wild comeback win in OT over the Wiz on Monday,\" SportsLine NBA expert Bruce Marshall said. \"CJ McCollum (42 points) almost pushed Washington across the line himself, but Cade Cunningham's 46 points saved the night for Detroit. Here's also a chance for the Pistons to avenge an opening-night loss at United Center when almost rallying from a 23-point deficit. Now Detroit catches Chicago on a three-game skid as the schedule has ramped up, and top scorer Josh Giddey (ankle) is iffy after missing Monday's loss to the Spurs. Play Pistons.\"\nThunder -7 vs. Lakers (-110)Oklahoma City has wasted no time putting the league on notice again this season, backing up its championship with an 11-1 start to the campaign. Each of the last six wins have come by at least 14 points, including a 126-102 win over Golden State on Tuesday night. Reigning MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is averaging 32.8 points and 6.4 assists per game, while Chet Holmgren is adding 19.6 points and 8.9 rebounds. Without LeBron James, the model does not think the Lakers have enough firepower to keep pace on Wednesday night, as Oklahoma City is covering in 67% of simulations. Back Oklahoma City at FanDuel Sportsbook:\nWant more college football and NBA picks?You've seen some of the model's best bets for Wednesday.

    "body": "\n        Notre Dame star Hannah Hidalgo set a new program scoring record during Wednesday's 85-58 win over Akron with 44 points. In the process, she also set a new NCAA Division I single-game record with 16 steals. Her entire stat line was impressive as she shot an efficient 64% from the field and 50% from beyond the arc. She neared a triple-double with nine rebounds, while also sprinkling in four assists. The previous Notre Dame record was 41 points, held by now-WNBA star Jewell Loyd and Ruth Riley, who won a national championship with the Fighting Irish in 2001.\"I mean, it's really special, but I got to give all glory to God that put the power in me to be able to do what I do,\" Hidalgo said during her broadcast postgame interview. \"And especially thanks to my teammates. Without them I wouldn't be able to do anything.\"\nThere are not many players at any level who can do what Hidalgo achieved on Wednesday. No NBA or WNBA player has ever registered 40+ points and 10+ steals in a single game. The last college basketball player to do so was Amy Patton for Northern Arizona in 2012.\nHidalgo is a true two-way player and although her scoring ability is impressive, she says it all starts on the other side of the court.\"Defense first, defense wins championships,\" she said. \"I make sure that I bring the energy from my team defensively so that we can get on transition and get buckets.\"The crowd at Purcell Pavilion cheered loudly for her after the game while her teammates surrounded her. This is a rebuilding year for the program, but Hidalgo has so far led Notre Dame to a 3-0 start. \nShe is one of three returning players from last season's roster, along with Cassandre Prosper and KK Bransford. Although there are a lot of new faces in South Bend, Hidalgo said she is having a lot of fun with this group. \"Oh, my goodness. I love my team, everybody. On the court, off the court,\" she said. \"I love playing with them.  There's nobody else I'd rather play with. It's just been so fun, from summer time till now.\"Hidalgo and the rest of the Fighting Irish can use this win to build confidence ahead of their first ranked opponent of the season. No. 18 Notre Dame will take on No. 16 Michigan on the road on Saturday afternoon. The game is set for 4 p.m. ET on NBC Sports.\n            ",

Two-time unified heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua is reportedly finalizing a deal to box Paul to end this year.Paul vs. Joshua is in the works for December, according to reports from Yahoo Sports and Ring Magazine. Netflix will reportedly stream the fight, which would take place in Miami. Paul and Davis' Nov. 14 fight was canceled amid new domestic violence allegations against Davis.There should be much more hype for Paul's fight with Joshua than the canceled \"Tank\" exhibition fight.The biggest criticism of Paul-Davis was the size difference between them. Paul regularly competes at cruiserweight, roughly 65 pounds heavier than WBA lightweight champion Davis' normal weight class. The weight gap was so big that Rick Thompson, chairman of the Georgia Athletic and Entertainment Commission, prevented the fight from being sanctioned in Atlanta.\nPaul (12-1, 7 KOs) unexpectedly became one of boxing's biggest stars with meticulous matchmaking. He often leverages his size and youth against smaller, older opponents with mainstream name value. The 28-year-old's biggest wins are against \"Iron\" Mike Tyson, former UFC middleweight champion Anderson Silva, Nate Diaz and former UFC welterweight champion Tyron Woodley, all of whom are currently in their 40s and 50s, with Tyson pushing 60. Against Joshua, Paul will have no such advantages. Two-time unified heavyweight boxing champion Joshua (28-4, 25 KOs) has every advantage over Paul on paper. Joshua is bigger, more experienced, technically superior, and hits harder. He's twice mixed it up with the greatest boxer of his generation, reigning undisputed heavyweight champion Oleksandr Usyk. While Joshua's best days are behind him -- Hearn suggested Joshua could retire next year -- the 36-year-old is young enough to handle Paul.\nPaul is on a six-fight winning streak, most recently winning a unanimous decision over Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. Joshua had a four-fight winning streak, which included a thunderous knockout of former UFC heavyweight champion Francis Ngannou, snapped by Daniel Dubois in September 2024. \n            \n    ",

You can catch all the action on Paramount+ as we will figure out what teams will join the United States, Canada, and Mexico and which teams will enter into the inter-confederation playoffs, which will take place in March 2026 to determine the final spots at the World Cup.It has been a topsy-turvy slate of Concacaf World Cup qualifying so far, as teams such as Panama and Costa Rica would miss out on direct qualification if things ended right now, but there's still more games to play to turn things around. After Cape Verde became the second smallest nation to qualify for the World Cup, Curacao could become the smallest if they're able to win their next two matches, especially a final day tilt with Jamaica. With a population of only 155,000, the Caribbean island would significantly beat Iceland's record of 350,000 people when they made the 2018 World Cup. Even if they don't win the group, there's still a strong chance to make the inter-confederation playoff. The two best runners-up in Concacaf World Cup qualification will advance to the interconfederation playoffs, where they'll face a team from the AFC, CAF, CONMEBOL, and OFC regions to determine the final two places in the group stage. That playoff will take place in March in the United States, but before getting ahead of ourselves, let's take a look at the final days of qualification.Costa Rica are chasing The Ticos are at risk of missing out on the World Cup despite having one of the strongest forward duos in World Cup Qualification with Alonso Matinez and Manfred Ugalde. Despite the duo, Keylor Navas hasn't been able to keep goals out of the back of the net, as only three teams have allowed more goals than them in qualification. Facing Haiti on Thursday, both of those teams need a win to attempt to catch Honduras in Group C. Costa Rica are looking to qualify for the fourth straight World Cup, but even though the World Cup has been expanded to more teams, that doesn't mean that it'll be easier to make the cut. That defense will come up against Concacaf's top scorer, Duckens Nazon, who has six goals during qualifying so far, making the job even tougher.Jamaica look to hold off challengersThe Reggae Boyz haven't been in the World Cup since 1998, and despite integrating dual national talent, they still face an uphill battle to qualify for this World Cup as well. With Trinidad and Tobago and Curacao on the docket, Jamaica will control their destiny but will need to find consistency in their results. If they didn't slip up against Curacao back in October, the Reggae Boyz wouldn't have been in this situation, so winning these matches can't be taken as a given. Led by Steve McLaren, they'll be looking from goals via Shamar Nicholson and Demari Gray while Andre Blake is in charge of securing the defense.Schedule All times Eastern, all matches available on Paramount+Thursday, Nov. 13\nSurname vs. El Salvador, 5 p.m. (Paramount+)Bermuda vs. Curacao, 7 p.m. (Paramount+)Trinidad and Tobago vs. Jamaica, 7 p.m. (Paramount+)Guatemala vs. Panama, 9 p.m. (Paramount+)Nicaragua vs. Honduras, 9 p.m. (Paramount+)Haiti vs. Costa Rica, 9 p.m. (Paramount+)Tuesday, Nov. 18Jamaica vs. Curacao, 8 p.m. (Paramount+) Panama vs. El Salvador, 8 p.m. (Paramount+)Costa Rica vs. Honduras, 8 p.m. (Paramount+)Haiti vs. Nicaragua, 8 p.m. (Paramount+)Trinidad and Tobago vs. Bermuda, 8 p.m. (Paramount+)Guatemala vs. Suriname, 8 p.m. (Paramount+)\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Crowds usually reserved for the weekend were on site Wednesday at the Pelican Golf Club in Belleair, Florida, as The Annika's pro-am featured two of the biggest names in women's sports in lockstep with one another. Playing together for the second straight year, Nelly Korda and Caitlin Clark joined forces for nine holes with Clark's Indiana Fever teammates, Lexi Hull and Sophie Cunningham, serving as caddies for part of the action.\"It's crazy,\" Korda said. \"That first tee was something out of a book, almost. But it's so fun. It's cool to see how many people she brings together to another sport, and it's fun to hang out with her. She's super cool. We saw each other last week at an outing, and it's nice to be alongside greats; even her teammates are super fun. It's been a blast so far.\"\nThis time last year, both players were flying high as they came into the pro-am together. Korda was named LPGA Player of the Year thanks to her six victories up to that point in the season, adding a seventh by winning The Annika later that week. Clark was coming off her WNBA Rookie of the Year campaign for the Fever. While her sophomore season featured injuries that kept her sidelined -- from both the hardwood and golf course -- at various points, the sharpshooter relayed she is back to being 100% healthy and trying to take advantage of the weather before winter arrives.\"I think it just shows how powerful supporting one another can truly be,\" Clark told Golf Channel. \"I've always been a big advocate of that and supporting women's sports. I've always been a big fan, whether it's golf or soccer, volleyball, whatever it is. So, it's really fun to see [Nelly] do her craft up close and how good she is.\n\"Getting to play with her last year, and I've played a few other rounds with her, she just makes the game of golf look really easy. You're almost like, How? She's great, and I am rooting for her to win this week.\"Despite a great run of form in 2025 that has featured eight top-10 finishes in 17 starts, Korda has remained outside the winner's circle since stepping into it at this tournament last year. She comes into The Annika having not played since the first week of October, where she finished T4 at the LOTTE Championship.No matter the time off, the world No. 2 has plenty going for her this week, given her comfort level at this golf course and another stroll around it with a familiar face on Wednesday.\n\"I think she enjoys everything that she does,\" Korda said of Clark. \"There are only so many things that you can juggle. There are so many things we have to do, and for her to be so laid back and relax and have fun and chit-chat with everyone is cool to see.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The defending champion rarely plays the B-side, but that's where Jack Della Maddalena finds himself against Islam Makhachev at UFC 322. Makhachev enters Saturday's pay-per-view main event as the favorite, but counting out the welterweight champ feels like a mistake. He has a better chance to beat Makhachev than most.Makhachev's legacy is the leading narrative for UFC's return to New York City. The record-setting lightweight champion and active pound-for-pound king moves up in weight to chase a second divisional crown and, with it, an entry into the GOAT conversation. But the shadow Makhachev casts clouds judgment about the man already wearing gold.    \"I've got everything to  prove. But I  like it that way,\" Della Maddalena told MMA Fighting. \"It gives me more motivation. A lot of  drive to prove  I'm the champion and then solidify my spot as the top  guy.\"I'm definitely the underdog. I feel like a  little bit I'm  being written off. Come fight night, and after the  fight, I think  there's going to be a lot of different opinions on it.\"\nWhy the lack of respect? For starters, Della Maddalena is untested as welterweight champion. His win over Belal Muhammad was convincing, but many would sooner forget Muhammad's grinding style and polarizing personality than acknowledge his talent. By contrast, Makhachev is revered. He set the record for lightweight title defenses, surpassing Khabib Nurmagomedov, B.J. Penn, Frankie Edgar and Benson Henderson before vacating and moving up. \n        \n            \n                UFC 322: Why Valentina Shevchenko vs. Weili Zhang represents the best of women's MMA\n                \n                    Brian Campbell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMakhachev's smothering grappling is a nightmare matchup for strikers, as has been the case with most fighters out of the Dagestani region. Size won't necessarily save Della Maddalena. By his own admission, he won't hold much of an advantage despite Makhachev's 15-pound jump. The challenge lies not in power, but in control. There's plenty to learn from their last title defenses. Makhachev finished elite striker Dustin Poirier; Della Maddalena outclassed dogged wrestler Muhammad. Poirier sees an opening for the champ.\"It's all going to come down to the takedown defense of JDM,\" Poirier told MMA Fighting. \"If  he can  get back up to his feet, if he can use the fence, or stay off the   fence, use his boxing, I think he definitely could give Islam a lot of   troubles in the center of the octagon. He's a great striker. He's big   and powerful.\"\nDella Maddalena's secret weapon is hiding in plain sight. Craig Jones, two-time ADCC silver medalist and one of modern Jiu-Jitsu's most innovative minds, is actively shaping JDM's grappling evolution. His influence could redefine how Della Maddalena handles Makhachev's pressure.  So much so that American Top Team coach Din Thomas and welterweight contender Sean Brady pick the champ to upset Makhachev.\"He's a breath of fresh air, and I'm with Brady on this one.   I'm picking him to beat Islam,\" Thomas told MMA Junkie. \"I think that Craig Jones is the answer in this... I think the answer lies within Craig Jones' approach of   blending in a jiu-jitsu style that these guys aren't familiar with.   We've seen it when Alexander Volkanovski fought Islam, and we've seen it   when Jack fought Belal.\"\nDella Maddalena stuffed six of Muhammad's nine takedowns, but that wasn't the key to victory. Muhammad couldn't keep him grounded. Thomas believes that evolution is Jones' imprint: Della Maddalena's growing comfort in transitional grappling.  \n\"I  think Jack's  going to be very difficult to take down and hold down. He  might be  taken down, but I think he's going to be very difficult to hold  down if  he gets taken down,\" Thomas said. \"I think on the feet, he's so precise. I  think he  loses the first two rounds possibly, but I think he comes back  and does  damage later in the fight.\"Della Maddalena bloodied Muhammad at UFC 315, landing 200 strikes in 25 minutes. His longtime coach, Ben Vickers, wants to summon that same brutality against Makhachev. Vickers believes sustained pressure will expose a weakness Makhachev has rarely faced.  \"I think Jack  will knock him out...\" Vickers told Submission Radio. \"He's not  used to taking  damage. He's not used to being in  tough fights with  someone pushing the pace, and he's been knocked out  before.\"\nIt's a bold prediction, but not without precedent. Poirier already showed that Makhachev can be tested on the feet. If Poirier could trouble him in the twilight of his career, Della Maddalena -- a sharper, fresher striker -- could find similar success. Oddsmakers list Makhachev as nearly a three-to-one favorite. By contrast, a hypothetical fight with lightweight champ Ilia Topuria is considered a pick'em. Many fans and bettors see this as Makhachev's coronation in a second division. But those closest to the challenger don't share that certainty. \"I think Maddalena is the toughest opponent in Islam's career,\" Nurmagomedov told Adam Zubayraev in a Russian-translated interview. \"That's my   opinion, not Charles [Oliveira], no one else. None of those other fighters. Not   even Ilia, if that fight were to happen. \n\"Maddalena is twice the size of Ilia. Taller, bigger,   stronger legs, bigger frame. His boxing is just as good. And, in   grappling, he scrambles really well if you've watched him. For me, if I were preparing Islam for either Ilia or Maddalena, I'd be more concerned   about Maddalena.\" \nMakhachev's longtime coach, Javier Mendez, has prepared accordingly. He admitted he's watched more tape on Della Maddalena than any previous opponent -- a rare statement from one of MMA's most experienced minds.  \"Jack is such a tough customer that if we overlook him, which we   haven't. I've actually viewed Jack's fight with Belal five   times,\" Mendez told MMA Junkie. \"I've never really done   that. That's how much I respect Jack.\"\nMakhachev shares his team's respect for the challenge ahead. He's built his camp around Della Maddalena's strengths, splitting time between Russia, Dubai, and New Jersey to find the right sparring partners and body types.  \"It's going to be a hard fight, honestly,\" Makhachev told MMA Junkie.   \"I saw his fight against Belal. He's good, man. When he began fighting   in the UFC, he had problems with wrestling, but now he's improved   because I've seen him training a lot with wrestlers and grapplers, and   that's why he's champion right now. \"He's good everywhere. But we will   see who's the best fighter in the world very soon.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NCAA placed Michigan State's football program on three years of probation following violations committed by former staff members during Mel Tucker's tenure, officials announced. The program also must vacate 14 wins from the past three seasons, including all five victories from the 2024 season, Jonathan Smith's first year as coach, according to ESPN.The NCAA found that Tucker and his former staff failed to properly oversee the program, resulting in violations involving three ineligible players. Investigators determined that staff arranged impermissible recruiting inducements and benefits, covered unofficial visit expenses and engaged in improper contact with recruits.In addition to vacating wins, Michigan State must pay $30,000 plus 1.5% of the football program's budget, which was $58.6 million for the 2024 season, per ESPN. The sanctions also include restrictions on official and unofficial visits, recruiting communications, recruiting-person days and off-campus recruiting contacts and evaluations over the three-year probation period.Tucker, former general manager Saeed Khalif and former assistant coach Brandon Jordan received show-cause orders, which bar them from coaching in college until the penalties expire. Tucker was given a three-year order for failing to adequately monitor the program, while Khalif and Jordan received six- and five-year orders, respectively, for knowingly providing impermissible recruiting inducements.\nIn a joint statement, Michigan State president Kevin Guskiewicz and athletic director J. Batt said the university pursued a negotiated resolution to minimize penalties on current athletes and staff, who were not involved in the violations.\"Today's announcement brings closure to an NCAA investigation resulting from violations committed by a previous staff,\" the statement read. \"With this matter behind us, we are able to move forward, focusing on the present and future of Spartan football.\"\nMichigan State fired Tucker for cause in 2023 amid unrelated sexual harassment allegations. Meanwhile, Smith is in his second season as Michigan State's coach, with an 8-13 record prior to the vacated wins -- five of which came during the 2024 season. Three of those victories were Big Ten games. The Spartans (3-6), lost all six of their conference games this season, leaving Smith technically winless against Big Ten opponents at Michigan State.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Philadelphia Eagles and coach Nick Sirianni won their third straight game by defeating the Green Bay Packers, 10-7. As the final score indicates, this was not some offensive shootout. The defense held Jordan Love's unit to 261 yards of total offense, while DeVonta Smith led the way offensively with four catches for 69 yards and Philly's lone touchdown.Once again, star wideout A.J. Brown was not very involved in the game plan. He caught two of three targets for 13 yards. This marked the fourth game of the season in which he recorded below 30 receiving yards. In all, Brown caught 31 passes for 408 yards and three touchdowns in eight games played. Entering Week 11, Brown is tied for 61st in receptions, and ranks 50th in receiving yards.Brown voiced his displeasure with his role in the offense on social media earlier this season, and he's doing something similar now. Recently, Brown joined streamer jankyrondo to play some \"Madden 26.\" Brown made several comments during the live stream indicating that he was upset. When jankyrondo asked him how he was, Brown had this to say:  \n\"No. Where have you been?\" Brown replied with a laugh. \"Family's good. Everything else? No. It's a shit show. You on some 'How you been?' I've been struggling brother.\"\nThis was not all that Brown said. He continued to voice his displeasure, saying \"If you got me on fantasy (football) man, get rid of me.\"\nBrown of course peppered his Madden avatar with targets, saying, \"Good things happen when you get touches.\" \nAfter the Madden matchup, in which Brown caught nine passes for 168 yards and two touchdowns, he said, \"I'm telling you bro, that's the only highlights of damn football I'm living right now.\"\nIt felt like Brown could have been doing a bit or joking around, but what purpose would that serve? He put himself in the headlines once again with comments that surely don't endear him to his franchise or the fan base, and put pressure on coach Nick Sirianni and offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo. Even if most would agree he should be more involved in the offense. Nick Sirianni respondsDuring a Wednesday morning interview with 94WIP in Philadelphia, reporters asked Sirianni about Brown's comments. \n\"Yeah, I mean, you can, again, when there's obviously (the) ability to debate what he meant or what he said, or 'Hey, why did you say why there?' Sirianni said. \"Listen, you go with your interactions with guys on a daily basis, and not what people are ... speculating, or anything like that. We're going to continue to try to get better on offense, and we played a great game on defense. We are in tune to what's going on here and the relationships that we have in here, and the process that we have in here, and A.J.'s all-in.\"\nSirianni also had his media availability later that afternoon, and as you can imagine, he was asked several questions about Brown's comments. For example, Philly's lead man was asked if Brown's comments this season have become a distraction.\"No, I don't think so,\" Sirianni said. \"You can only go from your interactions with everybody and the way they go about their work on a daily basis that you guys aren't able to see. But no, it's business as usual.\"\nLater in the press conference, a reporter told Sirianni that it didn't seem like it was \"business as usual\" with Brown, so how does he reconcile that with his star wideout? \"Yeah guys, I'm close to being done answering these questions with this,\" Sirianni said. \"He's working hard and he is a big part of this game plan and he'll be a big part of the game plan going forward. He's working like crazy when he's here, and I'm excited to have him.\"A.J. Brown explains his comments, says he won't apologizeBrown spoke to reporters on Wednesday afternoon, and he didn't back down from his remarks. \n\"I think that's fair, I think if you got eyes you can see that,\" Brown said. \"The same things I've been saying like all season. So me, making light of my situation on Twitch with my friend, that's something I'm not apologizing for. You know? Because like I said, if you got eyes, you could see that. Shoot, that's me trying to like laugh through my situation.\"Brown said that he sees the offense struggling, and wants to help contribute. He said that because of the player that he is -- and wants to be for this team -- that he's going to have a problem with the offense not being as efficient as it should be. Brown said the issue is not about targets, but about helping the offense. The three-time Pro Bowl pass catcher said that he thinks they need to do a better job at creating for him, and putting him in position to contribute. \n\"I think if we're really focused on winning and doing our job, we can't just keep slapping a band-aid over the defense doing their job and getting us out of trouble,\" Brown said. \"At what point are we going to pick up our slack as an offense? We're so great, and that's what I'm getting at. It's not about I don't care about winning or all I care about is stats. No. It's been week after week sometimes, we're not doing our job on offense. So you can't just keep slapping a band-aid over that and you expect to win late in the year ... it's not going to happen. \"Last year, what it was, thank you for the ring, but it's a new season. They adapted, we have to adapt and we have to continue to get better and try to find new ways. That's where the frustration comes in. It's not about winning, you guys. I want to win, yes. I want to help contribute as well, do our thing on offense as well. I think that's fair.\" Brown's full media availability can be watched here, courtesy of Devan Kaney at 94WIP. \nThere was some speculation that Brown could be moved at the trade deadline, but ultimately, he wasn't. Eagles general manager Howie Roseman told reporters that teams trying to win Super Bowls don't trade away talents like A.J. Brown.\"I think that when you're trying to be a great team, it's hard to trade great players, and A.J. Brown's a great player,\" Roseman said. \"He wears the 'C' for a reason. He's an important part of this team, of this organization. He cares about winning, he cares about his teammates, and I think that when you're a team like ours that is looking forward to an opportunity to compete for a championship, you just don't get rid of guys like that. We feel very lucky to have him on our team and excited about the second half of the season with him.\"Recently, it looked like Brown's role in the offense was getting to where it should be. He exploded for 121 yards and two touchdowns on four receptions in the Week 7 victory over the Minnesota Vikings, but injured his hamstring and missed the Eagles' next game against the New York Giants. Then came the disappointing outing in Green Bay, and now, these comments.\nSirianni says that Brown is \"all-in,\" while Brown says he's struggling, and clearly not happy with his contributions to the offense. Up next for the Eagles are the Detroit Lions in Philly for \"Sunday Night Football.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        In looking at the winners of the 2025 Cy Young Awards -- Tarik Skubal of the Tigers and Paul Skenes of the Pirates -- you can't help but wander into the future. The foundation is in place for these two aces to be all-time greats. This comes right at the time when the greatest pitchers from the previous generation are on their last legs. Clayton Kershaw has retired, Justin Verlander is 42 years old and Max Scherzer is 41. The list of pitchers in MLB history with at least three Cy Youngs isn't long, but all three of those guys are on it, along with Roger Clemens (who won seven), Randy Johnson (five), Greg Maddux (four), Steve Carlton (four), Jim Palmer, Tom Seaver, Sandy Koufax and Pedro Martinez.Skubal this season just became the first pitcher on the American League side to win back-to-back Cy Youngs since Martinez.\n\n        \n            \n                Tarik Skubal wins 2025 American League Cy Young: Tigers ace takes home award for second straight year\n                \n                    Dayn Perry                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIt's a bit of a changing of the guard, right? Skubal and Skenes are the present and the future of elite-tier aces. The chances of them joining Verlander, Scherzer and Kershaw with three Cy Youngs seem pretty decent. Skubal will be 29 years old next season. Since his return from flexor tendon surgery on his elbow in 2023, he's gone 38-13 with a 2.39 ERA (175 ERA+), 0.90 WHIP and 571 strikeouts against only 82 walks in 467 ⅔ innings. There isn't really much reason to believe he's going to slow down within the next few years. He hasn't been run into the ground with excessive workload, he's a big, strong guy and his stuff is electric. Sure, there is tough competition in Garrett Crochet, but -- assuming the Tigers either keep Skubal or trade him to an AL team -- as things stand right now, Skubal is the favorite to win the Cy Young again next year and probably the year after that. \nIt's fair to say Skubal is the best pitcher on the planet right now.If we were betting on which pitcher will win the most Cy Youngs moving forward, however, Skenes has to be the play. Skenes doesn't turn 24 years old until next May. He posted a 1.96 ERA in 23 starts as a rookie. He took the ball 32 times this year and worked 187 ⅔ innings, pitching to a 1.97 ERA, 0.95 WHIP and 216 strikeouts against 42 walks. He's bigger and stronger than Skubal, arguably with better stuff. It's probably thrown around too much in sports, but that old cliché that the sky is the limit? Yeah, that's easily the case here. \n        \n            \n                Paul Skenes wins 2025 National League Cy Young award: Pirates ace takes home honors in just second MLB season\n                \n                    Dayn Perry                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDo you know how many pitchers already had two sub-2.00 ERA seasons under their belt -- with at least 130 innings pitched -- before they turned 25 in modern (1901-present) MLB history? Only five. One of them, Walter Johnson, did it four times and is one of the greatest statistical pitchers in history. There are three others from the Deadball Era in Ed Reulbach, Ernie Shore and Smoky Joe Wood. And then there's Paul Skenes. And he has another year to spare! He could do it for a third time next year. \nTake note, again, that we're having to go all the way back to the Deadball Era. ERA+ is a stat that adjusts for era and ballpark conditions. Through age 24, among starting pitchers with at least 200 innings, here's the best ever in ERA+: 1. Skenes, 215 (meaning he's 115% better than average at keeping runs off the board)2. Bill Foster, 1933. Reulbach, 1744. Jeff Tesreau, 1735. Dave Brown, 169Walter Johnson's ERA+ was 165. Roger Clemens through age 24 had a 3.08 ERA and 141 ERA+ along with his two Cy Youngs and and MVP. Dwight Gooden through age 24 had a 2.64 ERA and 132 ERA+. Kershaw had a 2.79 ERA and 138 ERA+. \nIn terms of run prevention on a rate basis, Skenes doesn't just have an excellent foundation. He arguably has the best we've ever seen. Skubal in the last two years has a 2.30 ERA and 180 ERA+. He's obviously a bit older than Skenes and is a bit behind on racking up counting stats if we're talking about the Hall of Fame or something, but he's provided himself with a long runaway here. He'll look to win his third straight Cy Young next year. The only pitchers to ever win three straight Cy Youngs are Maddux and Randy Johnson, both of whom did it four times in a row. Skubal is good enough to pull that off. And Skenes is good enough to finish his career with more Cy Youngs than Skubal. The winners of the 2025 Cy Youngs have set themselves up for a run of greatness.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        A defender is not going to win the Ballon d'Or this time. Broadly speaking, that is probably the right thing. There is nothing more valuable and challenging in the sport than putting the ball in the net on a consistent basis. So long as Kylian Mbappe, Erling Haaland and Harry Kane continue to do that, they will be the frontrunners for a 2025-26 season that has an awful lot of football left to play.It is no reflection on our modern footballing culture, the brain melt of the Lionel Messi vs. Cristiano Ronaldo era, that defenders aren't winning the biggest prizes in football. That has always been true. There were a smattering of names in contention in the years immediately after France Football first awarded the prize in 1956: the English center backs Billy Wright and Duncan Edwards the following year, Giacinto Facchetti when Inter retained the European Cup in 1965. Perhaps the greatest defender ever, Paolo Maldini, received slightly fewer points over his entire career than Zinedine Zidane got when he won the prize in 1998.There are only five broadly defensive players to have been dubbed the game's finest: goalkeeper Lev Yashin in 1963, Franz Beckenbauer in 1972 and 1976, Matthias Sammer in 1996 and Fabio Cannavaro a decade later. Given that the Germans on that list often operated as sweepers, we can quibble about Rodri but it wouldn't change the broader point.It takes something fairly extraordinary for a defender to win the greatest individual honor in football. Suppose that were beginning to happen this season, though. What would it look like? \nWell, for starters, the defense itself would have to be sensational. It is harder to capture defensive excellence in quite the same way it is at the other end. We have a good idea when Haaland is playing well, the ball keeps going into the net. A low tally in the goals conceded column is not necessarily as indicative of exceptional individual performances but perhaps if the team performance was truly remarkable, one would have to consider the individuals within that backline. Of course there are some pure defending numbers that might tell a story, such as when a center back has 13 shots blocked and his goalkeeper has 16 saves. That speaks to a defender who is doing the very final, very important bit of defending very well.There are other statistics in which defenders might shine. Are they helping their teammates to progress the ball, whether through their carrying or passing? Are they getting a volume of touches that suggests they are trusted to build play? Are they showing strength in the duels? It probably wouldn't hurt to bear in mind that Rodri had his best scoring season when he won the Ballon d'Or and that Sammer came up with some clutch goals at Euro 96. It wouldn't be a bad idea to get as near as realistically possible to whatever number Mbappe et al set as the high water mark of scoring.If we want to get really creative, perhaps we might argue that they encapsulate a new mode of football as Beckenbauer did with his ability to drive possession forward from the back. At what might be the birth of the set-piece age, would it not be the time to celebrate the sport's most dominant force at dead balls?\nYou've probably worked out where I'm driving to here. I'd guess it was probably in the headline in the first place.How Gabriel compares to other center backs in the 2025-26 Premier League \n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            Gabriel Magalhaes fulfils all those criteria above. He has been the best pure defender in an Arsenal backline that, even after its wobble against Sunderland, is trending towards being one of only three in Premier League history to concede fewer than 20 goals over the course of a season. A few years ago, Gabriel's defining qualities were mostly his defending but his ability to move the ball up the field from the left-hand side he marshals has developed rapidly.Then there is the set-piece revolution at whose vanguard stands the big Brazilian. Since he arrived in England in the summer of 2020, Gabriel has scored 18 Premier League goals from dead balls. His nearest rival is James Ward-Prowse on 14. In the last four and a bit seasons of European top-flight football, only Harry Kane and Robert Lewandowski better the set piece output of the Arsenal center back. Already this season he has two goals and two assists to say nothing for the defenses who seem to fall apart when he attacks a corner. In a particularly limited set of circumstances he must be defended in much the same way as Haaland. If you don't limit the supply, you find yourself in the lap of the gods.\nContinue on this current trajectory and at the very least Gabriel will get a good number of votes. To muscle his way in among the winners, though, that requires excellence both from him and his teammates. The realistic path to him beating multiple players with a lot of goals probably has to include Arsenal not just winning the Premier League but the Champions League too. In at least one of those it would have to be incredibly apparent that this win came on a bedrock of clean sheets and it probably wouldn't hurt to weigh in with a few more of those goals in the biggest games. Think Rodri's goal against West Ham in May 2024 to wrestle the Premier League in Manchester City's direction.Given that it's a World Cup year, something similar will probably need to happen with Brazil, too, a grit and grind run to the final a la Cannavaro's Italy. This column has and will continue to insist that Ballon d'Or votes have generally cleaved too far towards picking the guy with the most medals rather than the outstanding footballer of the year but in these circumstances, you'd have to bear in mind that the second of the prize's three criteria is \"team performances and achievements\". And of course, in those circumstances, Gabriel's winning of the game's biggest prizes would have kept them out of the mitts of Mbappe, Haaland and Kane. What value all those goals if, at best, they deliver a domestic title?So perhaps that intro wasn't entirely accurate. It isn't beyond the realms of possibility that a defender might win the Ballon d'Or this year. All they need to do is be the best player on teams that win their domestic league, the Champions League and then the World Cup. Chuck a disproportionate number of big goals in there too and whadyya know, there's something shiny and spherical waiting for you in September.\nBallon d'Or power rankingsA quick reminder before we dive into this list: minutes matter. How can you be the best performing footballer in the world if you aren't on the pitch for much of the season? And so when big names like Raphinha and Ousmane Dembele take a tumble, it is often because of that. These may be less pivotal games than those that come in the spring and summer but they'll still count.Kylian Mbappe, Real Madrid and France (--)Erling Haaland, Man City and Norway (--)Harry Kane, Bayern Munich and England (--)Lamine Yamal, Barcelona and Spain (+3)Michael Olise, France and Bayern Munich (--)Pedri, Barcelona and Spain (-2)Gabriel Magalhaes, Arsenal and Brazil (NR)Vinicius Junior, Real Madrid and Brazil (--)Vitinha, PSG and Portugal (new entry)Bukayo Saka, Arsenal and England (--)\n            ",

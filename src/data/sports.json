    "body": "\n        Byes are done with for the 2025 NFL season, which means you have a full complement of Week 15 Fantasy football picks to choose from as the Fantasy playoffs arrive in mayn leagues. There are, however, player injuries, which is a season-long thing to deal with when composing a Fantasy football strategy. Nonetheless, the likes of Stefon Diggs, TreVeyon Henderson, Jaxson Dart, Christian McCaffrey and Rico Dowdle are back in action after being on a bye. But who should start along side them in Week 15 Fantasy football lineups?Speaking of injuries, Daniel Jones (Achilles) was one of many casualties on Sunday, as those who have been riding him all season long at quarterback are likely seeking out some Week 15 Fantasy football advice. His absence has a ripple effect, and while Jonathan Taylor remains a must-start, where do the Fantasy football projections forecast for Colts pass catchers like Michael Pittman Jr., Alec Pierce and Tyler Warren with the Colts uncertain on their quarterbacks plans and even bringing Philip Rivers in as an option alongside Riley Leonard?Before making your Week 15 Fantasy football picks, be sure to check out the Week 15 Fantasy football rankings from the proven computer model at SportsLine. Bet on every NFL Week 15 game at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your $5 initial wager wins:When it comes to ranking players, SportsLine's model beat human experts in Fantasy football for the past several seasons, especially when there were big differences in ranking. Over the course of a season, that could literally be the difference between winning your league or going home empty-handed.The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, including being ahead of the curve on players like A.J. Brown, Jonathan Taylor, Derrick Henry, Christian McCaffrey, Alvin Kamara and Jahmyr Gibbs. Anybody who banked on players like those could have made a run at their league title.Now, the model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, has revealed its Fantasy football rankings for Week 15 of the 2025 NFL season. Head to SportsLine now to see them. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. Top Week 15 Fantasy football picks One surprise in Week 15: The model is fading Colts tight end Tyler Warren, who is being started in around 65% of leagues, may not warrant a spot in Week 15 Fantasy football lineups. Warren is a by-product of Indy's passing game, which just lost Daniel Jones (Achilles) for the season, has Anthony Richardson on IR, and has third-strong rookie, Riley Leonard (knee) dealing with his own ailment, leading to the Rivers signing this week. Warren had season lows in both catches (2) and yards (15) on Sunday, with Leonard playing most of the game. Not much more is expected on Sunday versus Seattle, which has the No. 2 scoring defense and hasn't allowed a tight end touchdown since Week 11. Warren sits outside the top 15 in Fantasy football TE rankings.Another curveball: The model is high on Commanders running back Chris Rodriguez Jr., despite him being the RB50 in standard leagues and being started in just 35% of leagues this week. Rodriguez has leapfrogged Jacory Croskey-Merritt on the depth chart, as the former has more touches each of the last three weeks. He hasn't disappointed with more opportunities as Rodriguez has at least 52 scrimmage yards or a touchdown in five straight games. With the Giants' league-worst run defense on tap, as New York allows the most yards per carry and the second-most rushing yards per game, Rodriguez should find his way into your Week 15 Fantasy football lineups. For more start/sit Fantasy football advice, be sure to check out the rest of the Week 15 Fantasy football rankings.New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $75 in bonus entries when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2  in select states.How to set Week 15 Fantasy football rankingsThe model is also calling for a surprising running back you aren't even thinking about to finish in the top 20 of its Week 15 Fantasy football rankings, even slotted ahead the likes of Breece Hall and Ashton Jeanty. This pick could be the difference between winning big and going home with nothing. See the model's entire Week 15 Fantasy football rankings for PPR and standard leagues here.So who should you start and sit this week, and which surprising running back could lead you to victory?

    "body": "\nThe Week 15 NFL DFS main slate is one of the largest of the season with 13 games kicking during the afternoon windows. Though the NFL DFS player pool has increased, so has the size of many injury lists this time of year. Freezing temperatures could also slow offenses in games like Bears vs. Browns and Chiefs vs. Chargers. That's why Rams vs. Lions might be one of the top games for daily Fantasy players to target.Both teams have prolific offense and they're playing in a dome, leading to an over/under of 54.5 points, easily the highest total on the board this week. Which NFL DFS picks should you target, and which sleepers can differentiate your lineups? Before making any DFS picks on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings for Sunday, be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure. \nMcClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings.

If you're looking for a cold-weather bulldozer, Henry could be your pick. He's known to get stronger as the season goes on, and he thrives in games like Ravens vs. Bengals late in the season when the run games are essentially. Cincy's run defense has also struggled mightily this season, making Henry a go-to player to build NFL DFS lineups around on Sunday. See who else to roster at SportsLine. Bet Derrick Henry to go Over 87.5 rushing yards at DraftKings:\nMcClure is also building his NFL DFS strategy around Bengals tight end Mike Gesicki ($5,100 on FanDuel, $3,300 on DraftKings), who is coming off a huge 6-86-1 performance in Week 14. After being targeted five or fewer times in the first six weeks of the season, he's now seen six targets twice in the past three weeks. Joe Burrow seems to be comfortable with him, and there are 17 other tight ends ahead of him on the DraftKings price list, making him a steal in Week 15. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine. How to set Sunday NFL DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on Sunday.

    "body": "\nThe Week 15 NFL schedule features 16 more games, including several with potential playoff ramifications. One such game is an AFC East battle between the Buffalo Bills (9-4) and New England Patriots (11-2). Buffalo is favored by 1.5 points as Josh Allen and the Bills take on Drake Maye and the Patriots. Buffalo is on a two-game winning streak, while New England has won 10 straight and is coming off a bye. Another key matchup is between two NFC contenders as the Detroit Lions (8-5) clash with the Los Angeles Rams (10-3). The Lions are battling for a playoff spot, while the Rams are seeking to retain the No. 1 seed in the conference. The Rams enter as 6-point home favorites. Sunday's largest spreads include Raiders vs. Eagles (-12.5), Titans vs. 49ers (-12.5), Jets vs. Jaguars (-13.5) and Colts vs. Seahawks (-13.5).

After winning last year's NBA Championship following an NBA-best 68-14 record last season, the Thunder are 24-1 to begin this season, tied for the best 25-game start in NBA history. The SportsLine's advanced computer model projects the Thunder's winning ways to continue, making Oklahoma City to cover as 10.5-point favorites against the Spurs as one of its Saturday best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook.The model also projects the Magic to cover as 5.5-point underdogs against the Knicks in the other NBA Cup semifinals contest, while one of SportsLine's top experts has a pick for Indiana vs. Kentucky in a high-profile non-conference college basketball matchup. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every NBA game 10,000 times and has returned well over $10,000 in betting profit for $100 players on its top-rated NBA picks over the past eight seasons. The model enters Week 8 of the 2025-26 NBA season on a sizzling 29-14 roll on top-rated NBA spread picks dating back to last season.

However, that game was played in New York, whereas Saturday will be played on a neutral court, so the Knicks won't have the same advantage they did when the two teams met on Sunday. The Magic have the No. 7 scoring defense at 113.4 ppg allowed this season, and they are 4-2 against the spread as the underdog this season. Meanwhile, the Knicks are 3-7 ATS away from Madison Square Garden this year. The trends favor the Magic, as does the model, projecting Orlando to cover in 59% of simulations. Back the Magic at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Kentucky -125 vs. Indiana\"Maybe the Wildcats just aren't very good, but I'm going to take them here in a buy-low spot at home,\" SportsLine expert Thomas Casale said. \"Indiana has played one true road game and got smacked by a bad Minnesota team. If you can't get this early number, I'm good taking Kentucky up to -3.5. Just make sure four is the cutoff. I don't trust the Cats enough right now to lay more than 3.5.\" Back Kentucky at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Thunder -10.5 vs. Spurs (-115)The Thunder have won 16 straight games as a part of their historic start, including four straight by double-digits.

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is having another MVP-caliber season, averaging 32.6 points and 6.5 assists per game this season. The Spurs are off to a strong start at 17-7 this season, but the model projects the Thunder's No. 2 scoring offense (123.6 ppg) and No. 1 scoring defense (106.2 ppg) to be too much for San Antonio, with the Thunder covering in 67% of simulations. Back the Thunder at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:\nWant more Saturday NBA and college basketball picks?You've seen some of the model's Saturday best bets.

There are 46 FBS bowl games, so there are no shortage of opportunities to make college football bowl bets. The LA Bowl kicks things off on Saturday with Washington vs. Boise State (+10), with the first round of the College Football Playoff starting on Dec. 19. The opener is a matchup of Blue Bloods as Alabama is a 1.5-point road favorite over Oklahoma per the latest college football bowl odds. That's one of a handful of games with a college football spread of 3 points or fewer. Others include Missouri State vs. Arkansas State (-1.5), Washington State vs. Utah State (-2.5) and Arizona State vs. Duke (-3.5). The Sun Devils won't have quarterback Sam Leavitt (portal/injured) or star receiver Jordan Tyson (opt out)The largest of the college football bowl spreads comes in the CFP, with Oregon favored by 21.5 points versus James Madison. Other games of interest include powerhouse programs facing off, such as Penn State vs. Clemson (-4.5) in the Pinstripe Bowl and Michigan vs. Texas (-7.5) in the Citrus Bowl as the Wolverines will be led by interim Biff Poggi after the firing of Sherrone Moore. Before locking in any college football bowl picks, be sure to see the latest bowl and playoff college football predictions from SportsLine's proven model. New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $75 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times, and it is profitable on its top-rated money-line picks since the beginning of the 2024 season.

Both schools vastly underperformed this year but had strong finishes, with each finishing the season 3-1 ATS. However, Dabo Swinney has lost four of his last six bowl games, with each defeat coming by at least 14 points. This year, his Tigers are averaging 28.7 points, which ranks 61st in the nation, while Penn State, despite playing in the much tougher Big Ten, ranks 37th nationally in scoring. Also, the location of this game in New York City favors a northeastern university like Penn State over Clemson from South Carolina. The Nittany Lions cover almost 60% of the time, while the model also says the Under hits in almost 60% of simulations. See which other picks the model likes here.\nAnother prediction: Missouri (-6.5, 48.5) covers versus No. 20 Virginia in the Gator Bowl on Dec. 27 in well over 50% of simulations. UVA is coming off an ACC Title Game loss to Duke, in which the Cavaliers would have made the CFP if they had won. Thus, you have to wonder about motivation now that they have to settle for a lesser bowl game, and Virginia has struggled in bowls to begin with, going 1-4 over the last 19 years. Mizzou has won back-to-back bowls under Eli Drinkwitz, and the Tigers' only losses this season came versus teams ranked in the top 10 of the AP Poll at the time. Missouri is 4-1 ATS at neutral sites since Drinkwitz took over in 2020, and the Tigers are 12-4 ATS as favorites since the start of last season. See the rest of the model's picks here.\nHow to make college football picks for bowl seasonThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every 2025-26 college football bowl game, and it's calling for five underdogs to outright win in bowl matchups of power conference teams. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine, and for a limited time you can use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1.So what college football picks can you make with confidence, and which five underdogs are projected to win outright?

Cena must overcome a major obstacle in his retirement match. Former world heavyweight champion Gunther earned the right to retire Cena by winning The Last Time is Now Tournament.Gunther stood tall at the end of a 16-man tournament featuring superstars from Raw, SmackDown, NXT, and surprise opponents from Cena's past. Gunther also earned the distinction of retiring another legend of the game in Goldberg earlier this year in Atlanta. Cena's final year has been up and down with some incredible highs and a couple forgettable lows. He began the year by coming up short in the Royal Rumble when it was down to him and Jey Uso. Then, the infamous heel turn at the Elimination Chamber when Cena joined forces with The Rock and Travis Scott to beat down Cody Rhodes after earning his spot at WrestleMania. Cena then beat Rhodes at the event to break the record of most recognized championships at 17. After the title run and subsequent face turn came the return of Brock Lesnar to the fold where he and Cena faced off at Wrestlepalooza. Cena has also had fun throwback matches with CM Punk and AJ Styles along the way.The action on Saturday also features some interesting crossover matches between the WWE and NXT brands. Specifically of note, undisputed WWE champion Cody Rhodes will take on NXT champion Oba Femi in a battle between the two top champions from each brand. Plus, Raw tag team champions AJ Styles and Dragon Lee are set to take on the team of Je'Von Evans and Leon Slater. And former women's champion Bayley will face off against Sol Ruca.Below is how you can catch all the action on Saturday night.\nWhere to watch 2025 WWE Saturday Night's Main EventDate: Dec. 13, 2025Location: Capital One Arena -- Washington, D.C.Start time: 8 p.m. ETWatch live: Peacock2025 WWE Saturday Night's Main Event match cardJohn Cena vs. GuntherCody Rhodes vs. Oba FemiBayley vs. Sol RucaAJ Styles & Dragon Lee vs. Je'Von Evans & Leon Slater\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        For at least one day, Liverpool were able to look past their turmoil after defeating Inter 1-0 in Champions League play on Tuesday. Fans chanting Arne Slot's name showed a shift from backing Mohamed Salah in his current power struggle to supporting the manager who is tasked with leading the Reds through this rough patch in their form. They've shown glimpses in the Champions League, but sitting 10th in the Premier League behind rivals Everton and a newly promoted Sunderland, this hasn't followed the Reds into the Premier League.How to watch Liverpool vs. Brighton, oddsDate: Saturday, Dec. 13 | Time: 10 a.m. ETLocation: Anfield -- Liverpool, EnglandLive stream: PeacockOdds: Liverpool -150; Draw +320; Brighton +370As the team returns to domestic play on Saturday, focus shifts back to Salah as this could be his final game for Liverpool, and there's no guarantee that he'll even feature. Salah will be released for the Africa Cup of Nations to compete with Egypt on Dec. 15, following this match facing Brighton, and with a run that could take him to Jan. 18 if Egypt makes it to the final of the competition, the transfer window could be wide open upon his return.Slot didn't offer much clarity as to whether Salah would get to make an appearance against Brighton, but that also does make sense as this is a developing situation by the hour, let alone the day.\"Salah in our out against Brighton? I will speak to Mo in the next few hours, and this conversation will determine all next steps,\" Slot said in his prematch press conference before facing Brighton.While it's hard to see a way back for Salah after he went on record stating that someone at the club wants to push him out and that he's been thrown under the bus, it's also true that Liverpool wouldn't have many suitors for the Egyptian star in January. According to the Athletic, those discussions were positive and will see Salah return to the Liverpool squad for facing Brighton before departing for AFCON.\nConsidering potential transfers, if San Diego FC can't enter the picture, it could be a trip to the Saudi Pro League or bust for Salah. It'd be a tall task for another European side to meet Salah's salary demands, but there's also the case that Liverpool would want a transfer fee for Salah. With the 33-year-old on the wrong side of the aging curve and only having five goals and three assists all season while failing to register a goal contribution in seven consecutive matches, it's hard to see why someone would see that and decide to roll the Brinks truck up to Anfield to secure his signature -- not to mention that Salah put all his cards on the table, far from the best transfer strategy.Liverpool were going to need to eventually think about life without Salah, but it wasn't something that was the plan one year removed from winning the title; however, this season does provide them with an opportunity to plan for that. Even if Salah doesn't depart in January, Liverpool are already 10 points off the pace of Arsenal atop the league, the title race may not be over for Liverpool, but this is also a time when their best opportunities for silverware will come in the Champions League and cups.Knocking off Inter and Real Madrid in European play, there's no reason that Liverpool can't win the Champions League despite their domestic struggles. The Premier League can be a ground for figuring out what the best configuration is to do that as while they'll want to get back into a European place in the table, even with rotation, there's enough talent in the squad to do it. The Inter win saw Hugo Ekitike and Alexander Isak lead the line together, and more experimentation will be needed. \nLast season, Salah running hot and scoring 29 goals and assisting 18 more was enough to lead Liverpool to the title, but with that form out of the equation, Slot has a big question to answer on how to replace them. The expectation was that Isak would continue his own Premier League form after consecutive seasons of scoring 20 or more goals with Newcastle United but it has actually been Ekitike who has been the more effective of the forwards with seven goals and two assists in all competitions. It's far too early to say that Isak won't be a good fit at Liverpool, but the time is now for Slot to figure out how to get the best out of the Swedish striker.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        South Carolina is close to securing arguably its most important offseason victory. Quarterback LaNorris Sellers is nearing a deal to return to the Gamecocks for the 2026 season, CBS Sports' Chris Hummer and Matt Zenitz reported Saturday. The decision would keep one of the SEC's most dynamic dual-threat quarterbacks in Columbia as South Carolina reshapes its offense following coaching changes and a turbulent season.Sellers, a redshirt sophomore, has been South Carolina's starter for the past two seasons and has accounted for 43 total touchdowns during that span. He emerged as one of the league's breakout players in 2024 before enduring an uneven 2025 campaign as the Gamecocks struggled mightily on offense and finished with a 4-8 record that included just a 1-7 mark in SEC play.\n        \n            \n                The next transfer QB carousel is loading: Sellers, Raiola and the names every program is tracking\n                \n                    Chris Hummer                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDespite the offensive inconsistency, Sellers' production has remained relatively steady. He threw for 2,437 yards with 13 touchdowns and eight interceptions in 2025 while adding five rushing scores. Last season, he posted 2,534 passing yards, 18 touchdown passes and seven interceptions, while rushing for 674 yards and seven touchdowns as the SEC Freshman of the Year. Those accolades, combined with his profile as a 6-foot-3, 240-pound quarterback with mobility and above-average arm strength, elevated Sellers into a figure of national interest ahead of the January transfer portal window. His decision carries ramifications beyond South Carolina, potentially shaping a quarterback market in which proven starters are expected to draw significant attention -- and financial commitment -- across the sport.\nBut instead of testing the transfer market or declaring for the NFL Draft, Sellers is on the verge of returning to South Carolina in what will be a pivotal year for coach Shane Beamer, who is 33-30 (16-24 SEC) in five seasons and just hired Kendal Briles from TCU as offensive coordinator. Briles will be South Carolina's third offensive coordinator in the past three seasons.New offensive direction at South CarolinaSellers' potential return could be closely tied to South Carolina's decision to overhaul its offensive staff. Beamer turned to Briles earlier this week in an attempt to inject stability and production into a unit that struggled to find rhythm and keep Sellers upright (South Carolina allowed 43 sacks, the fourth-most in the country) in 2025.Briles arrives in Columbia with a reputation for building quarterback-friendly systems built on tempo. He was introduced Friday and acknowledged that the makeup of South Carolina's offense in 2026 remains dependent on the quarterback position -- starting with Sellers.\n\"We all want LaNorris to be involved with this football program and be the starting quarterback, so hopefully that's where this thing leads,\" Briles said during his introductory press conference.Briles emphasized that his offensive philosophy centers on adapting to personnel rather than forcing players into a rigid scheme. Protecting the football, varying tempo and deploying multiple formations will be foundational elements, he said, regardless of who lines up under center.\"It's really more about the offense fitting around him,\" Briles said. \"He's touching the ball every single snap. I'm not going to go out there and ask him to do something that he's not great at.\"\nRipple effects on the transfer marketSellers' impending decision has been closely watched across college football. Entering the offseason, he was viewed as a swing player in the quarterback market -- a proven SEC starter who would have garnered significant interest if he chose to explore the portal.\n        \n            \n                The transfer portal may open later now. That won't slow the pursuit of college football teams in need of a QB\n                \n                    Chris Hummer                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nQuarterbacks around the country are weighing similar options ahead of the January transfer window, with programs aggressively pursuing upgrades at the position. Established starters, high-profile backups and Group of Six standouts are all expected to draw interest in what is anticipated to be another lucrative cycle.If Sellers finalizes his return, it would remove one of the biggest potential prizes from the board and give South Carolina continuity. For a program looking to rebound in 2026, keeping its quarterback -- and building around him -- may be the foundation everything else depends on.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        This week Michigan's board of regents authorized a law firm to expand its investigation into the athletic department's handling of the Sherrone Moore situation, a person familiar with the decision told CBS Sports on Friday.The law firm Jenner & Block has been tasked with the review, which the source described as an \"open-ended\" inquiry into the athletic department. CBS Sports granted the source anonymity because of the sensitivity of the investigation.Moore, 39, was fired with cause during a one-on-one meeting with athletics director Warde Manuel on Wednesday afternoon after evidence of an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. Information on that relationship was turned over to the department that morning, sources told CBS Sports. Hours later, Moore was sitting in jail after allegedly breaking into a female staff member's home and threatening to harm himself with butter knives and scissors, according to the Washtenaw County (Mich.) Prosecutor's Office and Pittsfield Township police. \nThe Detroit News first reported Friday that Michigan's board authorized an expanded probe into the athletics department. The development follows a letter from university president Domenico Grasso to students and faculty, encouraging anyone with additional information related to Moore to contact Jenner & Block.\"This breach of trust by coach Moore is painful for many in our community, first and foremost, the individuals directly involved in this situation,\" president Domenico Grasso wrote in the letter obtained Thursday by CBS Sports. \"Yet our swift and decisive action reflects the university's staunch commitment to a campus culture of respect, integrity and accountability.\"\nMoore was detained by police Wednesday and formally charged Friday with felony home invasion, along with misdemeanor charges of stalking and breaking and entering or entering without breaking. He was released Friday afternoon on a $25,000 cash surety bond. A judge ordered the continuation of mental health treatment, imposed a GPS tether, restricted Moore from leaving the state of Michigan, and barred him from any contact with the alleged victim.Moore appeared in court Friday afternoon via video conference, wearing a white jail-issued shirt and pants, seated alone in a small room. A prosecutor said during the arraignment that Moore told the alleged victim: \"I'm going to kill myself. I'm going to make you watch. My blood is on your hands. You ruined my life.\"The prosecutor later added that the alleged victim \"was terrorized\" by Moore's behavior.\nMoore is due back in court Jan. 22 for a probable cause conference.Moore was 16-8 in two seasons leading the Wolverines. He was promoted from offensive coordinator to head coach after Jim Harbaugh left for the NFL following the school's first national title since 1997. Associated head coach Biff Poggi was named interim head coach Wednesday as the university searches for Moore's replacement. Michigan (9-3) is scheduled to play Texas in the Citrus Bowl on New Year's Eve.Richard Johnson contributed to this report.\n            ",

Put another way, it's reasonable to assume that if the Huskies had been at full strength all season, they might really be undefeated right now and ranked No. 1 in the Associated Press Top 25 poll.Against Texas, Mullins and Reed both started, played big minutes and combined for 22 points, 10 rebounds and six assists. Mullins, a 6-foot-6 guard, made two of the four 3-pointers he attempted and reached double-figures (10 points) in scoring for the third time in a four-game span.\"I think he's just gonna become so much more dangerous,\" Hurley predicted following the eight-point victory over Texas.\nNext up for UConn is Tuesday's Big East opener against Butler. KenPom.com projects the Huskies as 80-68 winners in that one and currently has them finishing 16-4 in the conference, one game ahead of St. John's. Top 25 And 1 rankings\n        Biggest Movers\n    RkTeams\n                    ChgRcrd\n                                1\n                            \n                                    Michigan\n                                \n                            Elliot Cadeau finished with 18 points and four assists in Tuesday's 89-61 win over Villanova.

    "body": "\nThe hot streak came to an end last week with my NFL picks.Time to regroup for the stretch run.It wasn't an awful week -- we've had those before -- but it just wasn't close to being good enough. I went 6-8 against the spread last week and 7-7 straight up. That brings my season record to 106-101-1 ATS and 140-67-1 straight up.Of course I would have had a .500 record ATS if Pete Carroll hadn't kicked a field goal on the last play of the game for the Raiders, but that's in the past now. On to Week 15 we go, with a better week coming for me. All Week 15 NFL betting lines via DraftKings SportsbookArizona Cardinals at Houston Texans (-9.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Texans are playing their best football at this time of the year, keyed by the dominant defense. The Cardinals are a mess. Their defense is really bad right now, which should help C.J. Stroud get it going. Look for a big game from him, and the Texans defense will continue to dominate. Texans big.  Pick: Texans 30, Cardinals 13Baltimore Ravens (-2.5) at Cincinnati BengalsSunday, 1 p.m. ET CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThe Ravens have lost two straight, including one to the Bengals two weeks ago. Joe Burrow lit them up in that game at Baltimore. What's to think that will change here since the Ravens defense isn't playing well. But what will change is the Ravens offense. I think it will show better than it did the last time and the Ravens will find a way to pull this one out.Pick: Ravens 30, Bengals 24\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 15 picks and score predictions: Patriots and Broncos both lose, Dolphins shock Steelers\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBuffalo Bills (-1.5) at New England PatriotsSunday, 1 p.m. ET CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThe Patriots are coming off a bye, while the Bills are coming off a come-from-behind victory over the Bengals. Josh Allen was Josh Allen in that one and that's the way it has to be for the Bills to win. He wasn't the last time these teams met, which is why the Patriots won. This time will be different. Allen wins it with his usual big plays.Pick: Bills 30, Patriots 28Cleveland Browns at Chicago Bears (-7.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThis will be Shedeur Sanders starting again for the Browns, and it should be. But this will be a much-tougher challenge than last week. The Bears lost a tough one to the Packers last week, so you know they will be back focused here. That matters as the Browns have nothing to play for anymore. Bears win it.Pick: Bears 30, Browns 17Los Angeles Chargers at Kansas City Chiefs (-4.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThis is truly desperation time for the Chiefs. They can't afford another loss. The Chargers beat them in Week 1, but this will be different. Los Angeles comes in on a short week and their offensive line is bad. Look for the Chiefs to win it behind their defense.Pick: Chiefs 23, Chargers 17Las Vegas Raiders at Philadelphia Eagles (-11.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Eagles are riding a three-game winning streak, but the Raiders are the perfect tonic to fix all that ails them. The Eagles have offensive issues, but this is the week to change that. Look for them to ride Saquon Barkley and they won't turn it over like they did in the loss to the Chargers on Monday night. The Raiders offense is awful and their line is really bad. The Eagles feast on that.  Pick: Eagles 28, Raiders 10New York Jets at Jacksonville Jaguars (-12)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThe Jaguars are riding high as they took over first place last week after beating the Colts, while the Jets are a mess. They have injury issues at quarterback, but does it matter who plays? The Jaguars offense has really come on and I think that continues here. Jaguars big as Trevor Lawrence plays well again.  Pick: Jaguars 31, Jets 13Washington Commanders at New York Giants (-2)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThis will be Marcus Mariota in as the starter for the Commanders with Jayden Daniels hurt again. The Commanders were terrible last week on defense against the Vikings, and have struggled on that side of the ball all year, so this is a chance for Jaxson Dart to do some good things, and I think he will. Giants win it.  Pick: Giants 30, Commanders 20\nCarolina Panthers at New Orleans Saints (+2.5)Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Panthers are off their bye, while the Saints are back home after two on the road. The Saints beat the Panthers in Week 10, but this Panthers team has been playing much better football lately. Saints quarterback Tyler Shough is playing well and the New Orleans defense can keep them in this one. Saints win it in an upset.  Pick: Saints 23, Panthers 21Detroit Lions at Los Angeles Rams (-5.5)Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThis is a big game in terms of playoff seeding. The Lions are 8-5 and can't afford another loss, while the Rams are pushing for a division title and the top seed. The Rams offense got back on track last week and the Lions have issues on defense. That's a bad combination. Look for Matthew Stafford to light things up against his former team, while Jared Goff can't keep up. Rams win it.  Pick: Rams 34, Lions 27Green Bay Packers (-2.5) at Denver BroncosSunday, 4:25 p.m. ET CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThis is the game of the week, featuring two teams that are currently the second seed in their respective conferences right now. Both have outstanding defenses, but the Green Bay passing game is better. I think that will be the difference. Jordan Love will win it with his arm.  Pick: Packers 24, Broncos 20Indianapolis Colts at Seattle Seahawks (-13.5)Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET CBS (Stream on Paramount+) \nThis might be 44-year-old Philip Rivers at quarterback for the Colts. It won't matter. This is a brutal test against a dominant defense in Seattle. Look for a big game from that defense, no matter who plays quarterback for the Colts. Sam Darnold will hit some big shots against a Colts defense that has struggled in recent weeks. Seahawks big.  Pick: Seahawks 31, Colts 16Tennessee Titans at San Francisco 49ers (-12.5)Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThis is consecutive road games for the Titans coming off a road victory at Cleveland. The 49ers are in off a bye. That's a bad combination and San Francisco is in a playoff chase, while the Titans are playing out the string. Oh, and the 49ers are much better. Look for a big 49ers victory.  Pick: 49ers 32, Titans 17Minnesota Vikings (+5.5) at Dallas CowboysSunday, 8:20 p.m. ET on NBC\nThe Vikings are playing out the string, but they did get a nice game from J.J. McCarthy last week, which is big for the future. Now let's see him do it on the road this week. The Cowboys are rested after losing last Thursday to the Lions. I see them bouncing back here as Dak Prescott has a solid day, but the Vikings will hang around.  Pick: Cowboys 24, Vikings 21Miami Dolphins at Pittsburgh Steelers (-3.5)Monday, 8:15 p.m. ET on ESPN/ABC (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Dolphins, thanks to a four-game winning streak, are still alive in the playoff picture. They won last week on the road against the Jets and now must face a Steelers team coming off an impressive victory over the Ravens. The weather is supposed to have temperatures under 40 degrees, which isn't a good thing for the Dolphins, who have struggled in those conditions. The Steelers will take it as Aaron Rodgers plays well. Pick: Steelers 27, Dolphins 20\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The entire women's soccer audience is keeping an eye on the free agency race for Trinity Rodman. As 2025 comes to a close, a new wrinkle in the negotiation mix comes into play -- a historic vote.After advanced conversations by NWSL's Board of Governors, the league approved a new financial mechanism on Thursday, per ESPN. The dramatic policy shift, crafted to retain the Washington Spirit forward and other star players, from fleeing to lucrative overseas offers, would allow teams to pay higher salaries beyond the league's strict salary cap. It is still pending approval by the NWSL Players Association.The potential new mechanism wouldn't be the first of its kind in American pro soccer, but would be new to NWSL. Unlike MLS' designated player rule, the proposed concept would not allow teams to offer unlimited funds to any player. Each club would have a set amount of money beyond the current cap to spend on star players that meet specific criteria, and funds could be used on multiple players. A vote on the new proposal also includes finalizing the parameters that define a \"star\" player.Following a 2024 Olympic gold medal win, the U.S. women's national team winger and Washington Spirit forward had become the most prolific face in American women's soccer at the moment, leaving plenty to follow her offseason journey as the biggest free agent on the market. \nAs the new year approaches, the 23-year-old has been transparent about her desire to stay stateside and play in the NWSL, but with ongoing salary-cap discussions, back-and-forth discourse between the league and Rodman's representation, and a grievance filed by the NWSL Players Association, the waters of negotiations have become a bit murky. While rumors of overseas offers are nearly a month old now, there's still time for anything to happen, including a stateside offer from the USL Super League. As the contract saga continues, we're here to help you keep up with the biggest offseason story of the year, with a look back at key points of Rodman's career, with a helpful timeline of events that have led up to the final month of 2025.Trinity Rodman contract saga timelineTo understand just how the contract negotiations arrived to the point of the players union filing a grievance, let's start with Rodman's rookie season and through 2025:\nOctober 2021: Rodman caps off historic rookie seasonRodman caps off a historic rookie season in NWSL by winning the 2021 NWSL Championship. After being drafted No. 2 overall in the 2021 NWSL Draft, the next-gen player earns starting minutes for her club side, racking up assists (five) and goals (six) in the regular season, and wins Rookie of the Year honors. She also won U.S. Soccer's Young Female Player of the Year and was voted on the 2021 NWSL Best XI First Team. Her historic season leads to a new contract, a record-setting $1.1 million deal paid out over four years. August 2024: New ownership after new coachesThe club pivots to new ownership, with new executive leadership, after multiple rotated head coaches between 2022 and 2023,  and finally looks primed to clinch a postseason birth. Rodman thrives under new management across the board with the national team and club. \nUSWNT Head Coach Emma Hayes has only 70 days to build toward the Olympics and quickly solidifies her top attacking line for the tournament with Rodman, Sophia Wilson, and Mallory Swanson. They go on an attacking spree, scoring 10 of the USWNT's goals, and are dubbed \"Triple Espresso.\"November 2024: Return to the title gameRodman and the Washington Spirit finally return to the NWSL Championship for the first time since winning during her rookie season in 2021. Though the post-Olympic grind catches up to Rodman as she tries to manage the fatigue and back injury, her minutes are shortened ahead of November, but she plays two 120-minute playoff matches before going a full 90 minutes in the NWSL Championship, where she continues to play through her injury. The Spirit fell to eventual champions Orlando Pride, 1-0, and Rodman prepares to enter the final year of her contract with the NWSL side. \nJanuary 2025: Rodman's contract almost upRodman begins her contract year, and clubs overseas are already \"monitoring her situation\" ahead of the NWSL season. She also begins her long absence from the U.S. women's national team. Her 2025 starts with extensive time off to manage a back injury. The winger has had some back flare-ups since her rookie season with the Spirit, but a long 2024 postseason run to the NWSL Championship final on the tail-end of the Summer Olympics means a lengthy time away for some recovery. February 2025: Slowly returningNWSL teams meet the hard deadline to start preseason training camps by Feb. 5, as per collective bargaining agreement rules, clubs must allow for a five to eight-week preseason before competitive matches. \nThe Washington Spirit competition calendar begins a week prior to the regular season due to their participation in the 2025 NWSL Challenge Cup. Rodman was with the club for preseason training, though the expectation was that she would gradually work her way into form. March 2025: Rodman begins her seasonRodman begins her NWSL campaign after time away from U.S national team camps. She missed out on January camps and the SheBelieves Cup but was with the Spirit during their preseason build-up toward the 2025 Challenge Cup. She dressed for the cup match, which the Spirit won on penalties, but did not play.The winger slowly built up her minutes during the regular season and played 45 minutes to an hour prior to April. Rodman also mentions in an interview that she's not sure her back \"will ever be 100 percent,\" and that it's a matter of \"when she plays in Europe.\" Her increase in minutes leads to a call-up to the USWNT roster. \nApril 2025: A return to the USWNTRodman made the USWNT game day roster for April friendlies against Brazil after increased minutes for the Washington Spirit. She scored a goal in the 2-0 win against the South Americans, but following the international window, she had an injury setback. USA coach Hayes and the Washington Spirit staff confirm that Rodman would go to Europe to work with team doctors on managing her back injury. There was no timetable for her return in order for the player to focus on recovery. August 2025: Monumental comeback goalRodman made a triumphant return to the pitch and scored in her first club game since April. It's an emotional moment, and the player continued to build up her momentum throughout the month. She increased her minutes load in NWSL regular-season matches toward the end of August.\nSeptember 2025: Picking up steam at just the right timeRodman returned to playing full 90-minute games and regained form. She scored three goals and notched two assists, and her performances earned her multiple honors, including spots on Attacking Third's Team of the Week and NWSL Player of the Month for September. Elsewhere, Chelsea FC signed U.S. women's national team winger Alyssa Thompson on a transfer from Angel City, and the move fueled more of the \"USWNT players leaving NWSL\" discourse among women's soccer faithful. The WSL club is no longer named in reports as a club interested in Rodman's services at this time. October 2025: Injury bug strikes againRodman's second-half season surge continues and shows no signs of slowing down. She plays more fully fit matches and continues her goal scoring as the season approaches the final stretch. Her strong form earns her another call-up back into U.S. national team camps for friendlies against Portugal and New Zealand, her first roster since April. \nThe Washington Spirit staff and head coach Adrian Gonzalez, to this point, have done a respectable job of rotating a heavily injured Spirit roster, with several players managing respective injuries. The club's more recent success placed them in contention for the 2025 Concacaf W Champions Cup, a tournament that crowns a club champion in the region, and the competition serves as a qualifier for the future FIFA Women's Club World Cup. Rodman sustained a knee injury during the match against Monterrey on Oct. 15 and was later diagnosed with a grade 1 MCL sprain and withdrew from the October international window with the USWNT. She was placed on the Washington Spirit injury report for the remainder of the regular season. November 2025: Touch-and-go status, but contract on the mindThe Spirit staff were hopeful that the MCL sprain diagnosis could be reevaluated for the NWSL Playoffs. Rodman reported for training wearing a leg sleeve and no brace, and participated in light, no-contact training, ahead of the quarterfinal. She was available and dressed for the first playoff round but did not play any minutes in the Spirit's quarterfinal win over Racing Louisville FC.\nThe Spirit made quick work of the Portland Thorns in the semifinal round, and Rodman marked her 2025 playoff debut at the end of the game. She played only one minute, but in four touches, recorded a dangerous shot on goal. The semifinal win propelled the Spirit back to the NWSL Championship after their runners-up appearance a year ago.Throughout the NWSL playoffs, Rodman's contract status was a key storyline as each game that passed was viewed with uncertainty on whether these were her final games in an NWSL jersey. NWSL Commissioner Jessica Berman was questioned about the league's salary cap amid Rodman's status, in light of a new deal being offered by a rival league in the United States, and Berman responded that the NWSL \"will fight to keep\" Rodman in the league. The winger played in the title game on Nov. 22 and subbed on in the 55th minute of the match. It was her most increased minutes load since Oct. 15. The Spirit settled for runners-up in the 2025 NWSL Championship, this time to Gotham FC, 1-0. Per the CBA, the league's base salary cap will gradually increase over the years. The base salary cap will go from $3.3 million in 2025 to $3.5 million in 2026, and expand to $5.1 million in 2030, following notable broadcast negotiations after the current deal expires in 2027. The salary cap base number increases by the team revenue share each year and accounts for 10 percent of sponsorship and media revenue for the league. The attention around Rodman's contract status remains at an all high, and despite a year of injuries and setbacks, she is the high-profile player on the free agent market. She was transparent with the media throughout NWSL Championship week about making no decisions ahead of the final, and how she tried to block out the contract \"noise.\"December 2025: NWSLPA files grievanceThe Washington Spirit named former Orlando Pride executive Haley Carter as the new club president of soccer operations, a move by the club that was perceived by analysts and the public as an effort to retain Rodman with the Spirit. Carter's hiring announcement came just hours before new reports emerged that Rodman and the Washington Spirit had reached a deal, but it was vetoed by NWSL Commissioner Jessica Berman.Berman's reasoning for turning down the contract was that \"it went against the spirit of the league rules,\" though no specific rules were violated and not cited in further reporting. The initial new deal was set to be a four-year contract, with payout passing the million-dollar threshold per year, with a portion of the contract backloaded, and would have been the largest contract in NWSL history.The new deal reportedly contained new-to-the-league mechanisms in paying a player, and a timeline that would crossover into future revenue growth options related to potential broadcast rights deals. League sources have indicated the backloaded offer contains unreasonable assumptions pertaining to the amount of future growth.  In response, the NWSL Players Association filed a grievance on behalf of Rodman, which was reviewed by CBS Sports, and states that the league penalized Rodman's free agency rights and accused the player of \"salary cap circumvention.\" The grievance also points out that the league violated multiple free agency protections previously negotiated in the CBA, including Section 13.6, which states a player's free agency rights \"supersede any other inconsistent NWSL rules, regulations, handbooks, or competition guidelines.\" Section 8.1 highlights no threshold for maximum player salaries, only a minimum salary standard for players. It also notes the league is unable to reduce player benefits: \"Nothing in this Section shall be construed to give the NWSL the right to limit or reduce benefits in any other part of this Agreement or any Standard Player Agreement.\"The grievance was filed on Dec. 3, and the league has 14 days from the date of the PA's filing to sustain or deny it in writing. If no response is given, a two-person committee with one league and one PA representative would review the contract situation. If no resolution is met, the dispute heads to arbitration. The grievance also inspired a letter addressed to Berman from Representative Emily Randall, a member of the Democratic Women's Caucus, who urged \"the NWSL to work in good faith with the NWSLPA and Ms. Rodman to resolve this matter in a timely and transparent manner consistent with federal labor law requiring that the terms of collectively bargained agreements be honored.\" Randall also noted that \"Congress maintains an oversight responsibility to ensure compliance with federal labor law, including the National Labor Relations Act.\"The league and its player association navigate uncommon territory as Rodman's contract situation continues to unfold. The NWSL remains adamant that it wants to keep Rodman in the league despite rejecting the initial offer and running out of time to negotiate a deal. \"Our goal is to ensure that the very best players in the world, including Trinity, continue to call this league home,\" the NWSL said in a statement to CBS Sports. \"We will continue to do everything we can, utilizing every lever available within our rules to keep Trinity Rodman here.\"The NWSLPA, though, claims the Spirit's initial offer is one that actually complies with the CBA as it currently exists.\"Trinity Rodman agreed to a compensation structure in good faith that would allow her to remain loyal to her first professional club, consistent with both the CBA and NWSL Competition Rules,\" the NWSLPA said in a statement to CBS Sports. \"The NWSLPA has challenged the League's rejection of this agreement on the grounds that it violates her free agency rights, but this isn't about Trinity Rodman. If NWSL can deny her free agency rights, they can deny anyone's. The NWSLPA will not allow it.\"As both sides try to navigate at a rapid pace, Rodman's representation is back to work for the player.\"We worked really hard to put together an agreement that we felt complied with the CBA (and) would keep Trinity in the league for the foreseeable future,\" Rodman's agent, Mike Senkowski, said on \"CBS Mornings.\" \"The NWSL doesn't have a certain way at the moment to pay her fair market value.\"\nNo new clubs have been named as suitors in the Rodman free agency market saga, though Senkowski did make it a point to note that he was doing his interview while in Madrid, Spain.Rodman recently uploaded a holiday video blog that details her time in Spain. She recorded her flight and discussed participation in a marketing shoot. She also includes a clip of her agent off camera and jokingly says, \"Currently my agent is raging about, ya know. You already know.\"Latest updateDecember 10, 2025: The NWSL's Board of Governors is in advanced talks to approve a new financial mechanism. The proposal framework would allow each team to have a set amount of money beyond the current salary cap to spend on star players who meet certain criteria, and those funds could be used on multiple players. The proposal still needs to pass with a vote.December 11, 2025: The NWSL board of governors approved a new method to pay select star players above the existing salary cap. The new mechanism would allow teams to spend up to $1 million over the salary cap on \"star\" players, with only a small portion of the salary count against the team's cap. The newly approved proposal is pending approval from the NWSLSP, as it affects the current collective bargaining agreement.The potential new rule contains qualification benchmarks for players being referred to as \"High Impact Players.\" Teams will be able to use the future funds on multiple players who meet the requirements. Rodman is expected to meet the minimum HIP requirements. What's next?While no current European clubs have reportedly thrown out their bids, Rodman's agent also reminded \"CBS Mornings\" that she has offers with more money on the table, and alluded to the offer that D.C. Power made during the NWSL postseason.As the league takes its time to respond to the filed grievance, it could reopen a window to renegotiations elsewhere. Transfer windows for many European clubs open Jan. 1 and close at the end of the month.\n            ",

    "description": "\n        The 2025 college football season in the ACC was chaotic and interesting, all the way to the drama of whether the conference would be shut out",
    "body": "\n        The 2025 college football season in the ACC was chaotic and interesting, all the way to the drama of whether the conference would be shut out of the College Football Playoff, but entertainment should not be mistaken for success. Yes, it was a good year for Miami, and there were certainly individual success stories up and down the conference standings, but the absence of strength when it comes to the ACC's traditional powers made it a tough year to claim supremacy on a national scale. The outlook in August suggested a return form with Clemson, Miami and Florida State all inside the top 15 of the preseason AP Top 25 poll. Week 1 wins for Florida State against Alabama and for Miami against Notre Dame backed up the notion that the ACC might finally have its football powers all running hot at the same time for the first time in nearly a decade. Unfortunately, the postseason review of ACC football does not match that preseason outlook or early season excitement. In fact, 2025 marked the ninth straight season that the ACC has failed to get Clemson, Florida State and Miami to all win at least eight games in the same year. Clemson's drop from playoff to the Pinstripe Bowl and Florida State's fall from top 10 to not bowling at all dampen what should be legitimate excitement for one of the best seasons Miami has had as an ACC member. In the absence of Clemson and Florida State did emerge some great stories, like Tony Elliott breaking through at Virginia with 10 wins and Georgia Tech racing out to an 8-0 start and a top 10 ranking. Recent ACC title contenders like SMU and Louisville were in the mix again, and Duke shrugged off a 1-3 nonconference record to take care of business against ACC competition and eventually win the league. If we are grading the conference as a whole, the phrase \"C's get degrees\" might apply here. The ACC was much more \"C\" than \"A\" when it comes to a barely passing grade that acknowledges both the failures of the programs at the top and the successes of the schools who broke through in their absence. \nMore conference grades for 2025 season: Big Ten | SEC | Big 12Now let's get into some team-by-team grades for the 2025 season: \n    \n                                        \n    Boston College Expectations were not high for Boston College in 2025, but the 2-10 showing falls even well below the thoughts that the Eagles might flirt with a bowl game. The team opened with a win against FCS Fordham and closed with a victory at Syracuse but lost 10 straight games in between. The margins were not always large -- three one-score losses -- but the defense was usually a major problem, and Boston College finished the year ranked last in the ACC and 129th nationally giving up 433.3 yards per game. Grade: F  \n    \n                                        \n    Cal By the end of the year, Cal had technically exceeded preseason expectations with a 7-5 record. The Bears beat Louisville and SMU in the final month of the season, and when you add in the early season victory against Minnesota and the highlights from freshman phenom quarterback Jaron Keawe Sagapolutele, there's definitely things to be proud of this season. But there were also lowlights, like staggering performances in losses to San Diego State and Stanford that prompted a coaching change and the hire of Tosh Lupoi. Even with the coaching turnover, there was enough good to award a solid grade for Cal's 2025 campaign. Grade: B \n    \n                                        \n    Clemson If we are grading Clemson based on where the Tigers stack up in the ACC, then Tigers had a fairly average season. The problem is we are grading Clemson based on the program standard and expectations heading into the season. Offensively, success would come and go, and defensively, they were talented but had a couple games where that group could not get the stops it needed to win. There is some credit for winning four straight games to close the season, but it's a sub-standard year that gets a sub-standard grade. Grade: D  \n\n    \n                                        \n    Duke The Duke Blue Devils won the ACC championship, and no one can ever take that away from them. But the team also lost at UConn and had some missed opportunities in losses to Tulane and Georgia Tech. If you flip just a couple of those results, this team is not just ACC champions but also getting to ready to participate in the College Football Playoff for the first time in program history. As it is, no one in Durham will complain about the school's first ACC football championship since 1989, which will always make 2025 a successful season. Grade: B \n    \n                                        \n    Florida State Unfortunately the 2025 season will be defined by the colossal crash out going from top 10 in the country with a win against Alabama to being 3-4 with a loss to Stanford in less than a month. Mike Norvell got a midseason vote of confidence and an end-of-year endorsement for 2026, but the Seminoles didn't have much of a spark with losses to Clemson, NC State and Florida in the final month of the season to miss a bowl game by one win. Grade: D\n    \n                                        \n    Georgia Tech The Yellow Jackets were on the cusp of a historic season, racing out to an 8-0 start with favorable matchups the rest of the way and jump-starting the conversation of a potential College Football Playoff appearance. But then the Yellow Jackets lost three of four and landed with a bid to the Pop-Tarts Bowl instead. The biggest issue here would be the defense, which gave up 48 and 42 points in the two conference losses that cost the Yellow Jackets a shot to play for the ACC championship and, in turn, a shot at the CFP as well. Grade: B\n\n    \n                                        \n    Louisville On the morning of Nov. 9, Louisville was 7-1 and ranked 15th in the country. The only loss on the season to that point was to Virginia in overtime, and the Cards had already pocketed wins against now-playoff teams Miami and JMU. Then, on Nov. 9, they lost a stunner to Cal, falling at home as a double-digit favorite, and proceeded to lose the next two games as well. A 41-0 blasting of Kentucky cleansed the palette a little bit, but that three-game losing streak in November soured what was shaping up to be a another year of ACC title contention for Jeff Brohm. Grade: C\n    \n                                        \n    Miami Miami made some program history in 2025 that is worth celebrating. Mario Cristobal has the Hurricanes making their first-ever College Football Playoff in Year 4 of his tenure, and for the first time as an ACC member (since 2004), Miami has put together back-to-back 10-win seasons. But if we are looking at 2025 through a vacuum, then Miami met most preseason expectations with its performance. The Hurricanes winning 10 games is about on par with what was expected from the roster, and a top-10 preseason ranking was fulfilled finishing 10th in the rankings at the end of the season. It was a great team that will now have a chance to prove it's ultimate value in the CFP, but given the talent on this roster, this should be a \"meets expectations\" grade for Cristobal's Canes. Grade: B\n    \n                                        \n    NC State Joe Ovies, of the Ovies & Giglio Podcast, succinctly defined the NC State football experience in the Dave Doeren era as a couple games that make you go, \"hell yeah brother,\" and a couple of games that make you go, \"what the [bleep] was that?\" NC State beat top-10 Georgia Tech in the same building where it lost to a Virginia Tech team that had just fired its coach. The Wolfpack beat Virginia in a game that wasn't a conference game yet looked non-competitive against Notre Dame and Miami. It's a wide range of results on the year that come out in the wash to average NC State football season. Grade: C\n\n    \n                                        \n    North Carolina Preseason expectations had the Tar Heels between seven and eight wins against a favorable schedule, so the 4-8 showing was certainly a disappointment to kick off the Bill Belichick era. North Carolina's offense was mostly ineffective against FBS competition, and the common thread across three one-score losses was self-inflicted wounds. Nationally, the Tar Heels ranked No. 121 in scoring offense (19.3 points per game), No. 131 in total offense (228.8 yards per game) and No. 109 in penalty yards (62.6 yards per game). When costly turnovers, penalties and offensive execution are the biggest issues, it's hard to call the season a success. There was good work done in Belichick's Year 1, and it's factually true that flipping a couple of those one-score losses makes UNC a bowl team, but the quality was far below expectations for any power conference team. Grade: F \n    \n                                        \n    Pittsburgh The midseason revelation of quarterback Mason Heintschel really saved Pitt's season. The Panthers lost the Backyard Brawl against West Virginia and dropped the ACC opener to Louisville, then Heintschel and the high-powered offense ripped off five straight wins where the team averaged 40.0 points per game in that span. Water found its level a little bit with late season defeats to Notre Dame and Miami, but all in all a pretty good season for Pat Narduzzi in Year 11 leading the program. Grade: B \n    \n                                        \n    SMU This was probably a better team than the record suggests, particularly when you consider the weight of the upset loss to Cal in the regular-season finale. That loss bounced SMU from the ACC Championship Game and a shot at making the College Football Playoff for a second straight season, so yes, the difference between 8-4 and 9-3 is pretty massive when it comes to a final grade for the season. As it stands, the eight-win campaign qualifies as \"meets expectations\" and gets a grade appropriate with that kind of result. Grade: C \n\n    \n                                        \n    Stanford The expectations were not high for a Frank Reich-led Stanford team that had to play a season while Andrew Luck picked a new coach to lead the program. The preseason outlook called for three or four wins, and the Cardinal came through with a 4-8 record. What stands out, though, is the 3-5 mark against ACC opponents where Stanford deserves credit for being opportunistic in home games to finish one game below .500 in league play. Grade: C\n    \n                                        \n    Syracuse The Orange closed the season with eight straight losses, all by double digits, as the offense never recovered from the season-ending injury to Steve Angeli. That early season win against Clemson, the game where Angeli was hurt, proved to be the highlight of the season, and things just spiraled into more and more frustrating defeats as the season went along. Things truly bottomed out at the end of November with a 70-7 loss to Notre Dame and then a 22-point loss at home to a Boston College team that entered the season on a 10-game losing streak. Grade: F \n    \n                                        \n    Virginia Offseason investments paid off not just with a breakthrough season for Tony Elliott but one of the best seasons in school history. There is obvious disappointment from falling just short of an ACC championship and the College Football Playoff after an overtime defeat to Duke in Charlotte, but this is still just the second 10-win season in program history. Early season wins against Florida State and at Louisville built the confidence that the Wahoos could hang with anyone in the league, and even though the wins weren't always pretty, the winning DNA was real. That's a credit to Elliott and his staff, getting a team with heavy transfer influence on the same page to put together a historic season. Grade: A \n\n    \n                                        \n    Virginia Tech No one had specifically penciled Virginia Tech in as an ACC title contender, but the Hokies were expected to be a solid bowl team and one of the better squads of the Brent Pry era. After an 0-3 start that saw Virginia Tech lose by an average of 18.7 points per game, the school decided to fire Pry, and while there were a couple of good highlights showcasing the players' resiliency (wins at NC State and in overtime against Cal) this was not a successful season by any measure. The future looks bright with James Franklin taking over, but the final grade for 2025 is not a passing one. Grade: F\n    \n                                        \n    Wake Forest Oddsmakers set the over-under win total for Wake Forest at 4.5, so yes, going 8-4 in Year 1 of the Jake Dickert era would quality of far exceeding preseason expectations. The Demon Deacons not only made a bowl game, but had it locked up by mid-November thanks to upset wins against conference title contenders SMU and Virginia. Outside of a lopsided loss at Florida State, there was not a game that Wake Forest was out-classed in all season despite some significant roster and coaching turnover. The school has made just three football hires in the 21st century, and early returns suggest Dickert could be just as much of a home run as Dave Clawson and Jim Grobe before him. Grade: A \n            ",

Navy has dominated its rivalry against Army over the years, winning 14 of the last 20 meetings. However, Army has been victorious in two of the past three meetings, and SportsLine's model is backing the Black Knights to cover the spread in 55% of simulations. According to the latest college football odds, the Black Knights are 6.5-point underdogs, while the over/under for Army vs. Navy is 38.5. The model is also backing Boise State (+10) to cover the spread against Washington in the LA Bowl, while the Over (52.5) hits 53% of the time in Boise State vs. Washington.

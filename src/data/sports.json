    "body": "\n        The latest DraftKings promo code offers new users $300 in bonus bets and three free months of NBA League Pass. After a wild 18-inning Game 3 of the World Series on Monday, the players won't have much time to recover with a pivotal Game 4 on Tuesday. The sports calendar is packed with the MLB, NBA, NHL, college football, and more for online sports betting options, but Game 4 of the 2025 World Series will garner much of the nation's attention. One of the SportsLine model's Tuesday best bets at DraftKings features the Blue Jays covering as +1.5 underdogs after a long night of 18 innings of World Series action on Monday.The model also has a pair of best bets outside of the World Series. The Bucks are home against the Knicks with both teams entering with 2-1 records, yet Milwaukee is the underdog. The model recommends taking the 1.5 points on the Bucks to back Milwaukee in its Tuesday best bets at DraftKings. There are only two college football games in action on Tuesday, but the model sees strong value in backing Over 55.5 total points in James Madison vs. Texas State in Tuesday best bets at DraftKings. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins, plus 3 months of NBA League Pass free: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every MLB game 10,000 times. It enters the 2025 World Series a profitable 35-29 on top-rated MLB money-line picks this season. It also enters the 2025-26 NBA season on a sizzling 160-118 roll on all top-rated NBA picks, returning nearly $4,000. It also went 24-11 (69%) on top-rated NBA against-the-spread picks last season. Anybody following its MLB betting picks or NBA betting advice at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Tuesday best bets at DraftKings SportsbookBlue Jays (+1.5) vs. Dodgers (-117)Bucks (+1.5) vs. Knicks (-108)James Madison vs. Texas State: Over 55.5 total points scored (-112)Combining the model's three picks into a Tuesday parlay at DraftKings would result in a payout of +576 (risk $100 to win $589). Bet it at DraftKings here:\nBlue Jays (+1.5) vs. Dodgers (-117)Toronto hung around for 18 innings with the Dodgers on Monday before falling 6-5 on a walk-off Freddie Freeman home run, and although the Blue Jays players don't care about this fact, that result was a win for Toronto +1.5 backers. The model likes the value on the Blue Jays at +1.5 again on Tuesday, as Toronto has covered the number in two of three games despite the Dodgers leading the series, 2-1. Shohei Ohtani is scheduled to start for the Dodgers, but he was seen wincing while running the bases late on Monday, so he could be less than 100%. The Blue Jays are starting Shane Bieber, who has allowed just two earned runs in each of his three postseason starts. Given the importance of this game to even up the series, the model expects a strong showing from the Blue Jays on Monday, predicting them to cover as +1.5 underdogs in 67% of simulations. Back the Blue Jays at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Bucks (+1.5) vs. Knicks (-108)It's been a streaky history between the Knicks and Bucks over recent years, and the Bucks hope to start a new streak on Tuesday. The Knicks have won five straight head-to-head matchups, including all three last season, but before the current streak, the Bucks won nine straight against New York. The Bucks are 4-2 over their last six home games against New York, and they'll be the hosts on Tuesday. Giannis Antetokounmpo has scored at least 24 points in seven straight games against the Knicks, and he's off to a dominating start, averaging 36 points, 16 rebounds and seven assists to begin this season. Both the Knicks and Bucks are 2-1 this season, so with Milwaukee getting points at home, the model is leaning that way. The model projects the Bucks to cover the spread in 54% of simulations. Back the Bucks at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:James Madison vs. Texas State: Over 55.5 total points scored (-112)James Madison is coming off a nine-touchdown, 63-point performance in a 63-27 win over Old Dominion on Oct. 18, and the model expects the Dukes' offense to carry over that success into Tuesday night. Outside of taking knees to run out the clock on the final possession, James Madison scored a touchdown on nine of 13 drives in its last game. Alonza Barnett III had 448 combined passing and rushing yards with six touchdowns in the victory. Also, Texas State's recent results signal a high likelihood of the Over hitting even more than James Madison's last game. The last three Texas State games have featured an average of 75.7 combined points, with all three games totaling at least 61 points. The model projects the Over to hit in 70% of simulations. Back the Over at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:\nWant more Tuesday World Series, NBA, college football picks?You've seen the model's Tuesday best bets.

Pacheco left Monday night's 28-7 win over the Washington Commanders with a knee injury. Before going down with the injury, the two-time Super Bowl MVP registered 12 carries for 58 yards in their game against Washington. Pacheco has 78 carries for 329 yards and one touchdown this season, along with 11 receptions for 43 yards and one touchdowns in the air. Kareem Hunt is the next man up. In 2025, Hunt has 62 carries for 245 yards and four touchdowns so far this season. The running back room also includes Brashard Smith and Elijah Mitchell. The Chiefs' offense seems to be finding their identity more, but still needs work and Pacheco's injury won't help their case.Rashee Rice is back, after the wide receiver missed six games for violating the league's personal conduct policy for his involvement in a hit-and-run crash in March 2024. Rice caught three touchdown passes through two games.The Chiefs next few games are against the Buffalo Bills, Denver Broncos, Indianapolis Colts and Dallas Cowboys.\nPacheco missed eight games last season, seven for a broken fibula and one for a rib injury. Despite missing time, he was second on the team in rushing yards (310) behind Hunt (728).\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Tulane coach Jon Sumrall is fully focused on the Green Wave's mission to win the American this season. All of the LSU buzz and his name being attached to other vacancies can sit right where it lays -- in speculative la-la land -- as far as he's concerned.Sumrall was succinct in his messaging this week when asked about the Tigers' vacancy following their firing of Brian Kelly.\"I get those questions because we're having success. The coaching carousel isn't even a thought,\" Sumrall said Tuesday. \"We're in the midseason phase. Whatever people want to speculate, they can do that. UTSA has 100% of my focus.\"Unbeaten in the American with its lone loss coming to Ole Miss earlier this season, Tulane battles UTSA on Thursday before a showdown with Memphis next month. The winner of the American likely earns the Group of Five's auto-bid to the College Football Playoff given the breadth of good teams within the league.\nThe Green Wave are on the cusp of the top 25 despite losing star quarterback Darian Mensah to Duke this offseason and several other key contributors in the transfer portal. Sumrall was a part of coaching staffs at Kentucky and Ole Miss before leading the show with success at Troy and Tulane. He's a Kentucky alum, but that job still belongs to Mark Stoops for the time being. \"No distractions are going to come up with this football team,\" Sumrall said Monday night on Aaron Torres' podcast. \"And what I mean by that is when things are going bad, there may be fans or people on like Twitter or whatever the heck it's called now, they're calling for me to get fired, right? And when things are going good, they may try to speculate, like, 'Hey, Coach could go here or do that. Do something else.' \n\"Same thing with the assistant coaches. We play a great offensive game, everybody's gonna talk about, '(Offensive coordinator) Coach (Joe) Craddock should be on this watch list for a job.' Or if we play a bad offensive game, we're talking about, 'How do we get him out of here? Let's run him out of town.'\"\n        \n            \n                You can't fake 'fam-uh-lee' forever: Brian Kelly's end came fast, but his LSU downfall was years in the making\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSumrall said he's \"micro-focused\" on the task at hand and end-of-year conversations about other job opportunities will be had at the end of Tulane's season.\"If my ultimate goal is just to be a Power Four head coach, I wouldn't be at Tulane. I've had those opportunities,\" Sumrall said. \"If my ultimate goal was just to make the biggest paycheck, I wouldn't be at Tulane. Other people have offered me more money than I make here. I love where I'm at. I love what I do. \n\"I love what I do with ... I told my team, 25 years from now, can I tell you I'm gonna be sitting here coaching? I don't know that, but I wouldn't be mad about it. I'm cool. Like, I wouldn't be pissed about that. It'd be cool, I love New Orleans. I love everything about my job.' I'm so freaking micro-focused on going 1-0 every week that, all that speculation, I don't pay attention to it. When people bring it up to me, I'm like, 'Get away from me. Don't even talk.' Like, I ain't got no time for it.\"\n            ",

Officers said they discovered Peterson's vehicle parked near a gas pump and noted signs of impairment, including bloodshot eyes, slurred speech and the smell of alcohol.According to court records, Peterson told officers he had been at a poker game in Houston and was trying to drive home to Missouri City. He admitted to having two to three shots of a vodka mix earlier that morning and rated himself a \"2\" on a scale of 0 to 10 for intoxication, per the affidavit. Police said Peterson swayed during a field sobriety test, and a search of his SUV uncovered a Glock handgun in the glove compartment.Peterson was released from Fort Bend County Jail Monday after posting a combined $3,000 bond, according to the report.\n        \n            \n                Carson Wentz to have season-ending shoulder surgery: What this means for his future and the Vikings' season\n                \n                    Bryan DeArdo                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nPeterson was arrested earlier this year on similar DWI charges, just hours after leaving Minnesota's 2025 NFL Draft party. Peterson got into a fight with a man over a poker game earlier this summer and tried to cash in on the skirmish after signing a Celebrity Boxing contract, according to TMZ Sports, with his first fight coming against Joe \"Baby Joe\" Castaneda, the person at the center of the May brawl at JokerStars in Houston.\nNo charges were filed from the fight and police were not involved. Video of the incident showed Peterson emerge with a bloody face, but he said the cut came from hitting a chair during the melee.Peterson lost his only other boxing match after he was knocked out in 2022 by former NFL running back Le'Veon Bell.The NFL's Rookie of the Year out of Oklahoma in 2007, Peterson rushed for 14,918 and 120 touchdowns over his 15-year career. He played his first 10 seasons in Minnesota before brief stints in New Orleans, Washington, Arizona, Detroit, Tennessee and Seattle. Peterson attempted a comeback following his final NFL season in 2021 after sitting out the 2022 season, but it didn't materialize. The former league MVP was 38 at the time and would've been the oldest running back to play in the NFL in the Super Bowl era, which stretches back to 1966. \nPeterson is from Palestine, Texas, which is three hours north of Sugar Land.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        A pair of AFC division leaders headline the NFL Week 9 schedule when the Indianapolis Colts take on the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday. The Colts, behind running back Jonathan Taylor and quarterback Daniel Jones, have taken command of the AFC South at 7-1. Pittsburgh, meanwhile, is in control of the AFC North at 4-3, but have dropped two in a row. Quarterback Aaron Rodgers is coming off a disappointing performance in a loss to the Green Bay Packers, a team he spent 18 years with. Indianapolis enters as a 3-point favorite and is one of seven road favorites during the Week 9 NFL schedule.  Another matchup involving contenders sees the Kansas City Chiefs (4-3) visiting the Buffalo Bills (5-2). The Chiefs are -1.5 favorites, one of eight games with spreads of -3 or more as former MVP quarterbacks Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen square off.

    "body": "\n        It's incredible how much criticism heavyweight champion Tom Aspinall has endured following the disaster that was last Saturday's UFC 321 pay-per-view main event for something that wasn't remotely his fault. Aspinall (15-3, 1 NC), with the non-stop drama of his fruitless attempt to unify titles against former champion Jon Jones finally behind him, returned from a 15-month layoff to make his first undisputed title defense against former interim titleholder Cyril Gane in Abu Dhabi. But just over four minutes after the fight started, a double eye poke from Gane (13-2, 1 NC) rendered the British slugger unable to see. The only thing worse than the heavyweight title picture being forced, once again, to stay stagnant following the no contest ruling was how many fans, media members and current or former UFC fighters (namely Chael Sonnen and Anthony Smith) chose to focus their reaction to the fight around the idea that Aspinall, 32, should've just toughened up and fought through it. Not only did Aspinall get viciously scratched in his left eye, leaving him unable to see after the accidental foul, replays showed that Gane's other finger entered his right eye socket all the way down to the second knuckle in an absolutely gruesome turn of events. \nA big part of the negative reaction against Aspinall was likely heightened by the fact that Gane, the 35-year-old Frenchman who entered as a massive underdog after failing miserably in a pair of title fights over the last three years, came out hot and bloodied the nose of Aspinall following a series of stiff jabs and movement. \n        \n            \n                UFC 321 fallout: Tom Aspinall vs. Ciryl Gane rematch, Mackenzie Dern vs. Tatiana Suarez among fights to make\n                \n                    Shakiel Mahjouri                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe reality is that no one truly knows what type of pain and discomfort Aspinall was feeling unless they were in his body after the foul took place (despite unscrupulous booing from the crowd against him). Furthermore, this wasn't a random Fight Night main event. After everything Aspinall has been through in recent years, including being jerked around as an inactive interim titleholder through Jones' year-plus injury recovery and his eventual refusal to fight Aspinall (and short-lived retirement), there was simply too much at stake and too many factors going against Aspinall to take a gamble of this magnitude. \nNot to mention, almost no one was pointing the (pardon the pun) finger back in the direction of Gane for such an egregious foul, which could've brought consideration from referee Jason Herzog for a disqualification, rather than a no contest. Provided he can return quickly for a rebooking of the fight, Aspinall should have even more motivation to prove himself in the inevitable rematch. But for a pound-for-pound ranked fighter who has done almost everything right, seeing him reduced to having to defend his toughness by live streaming his doctor's visit the following day in some ill-advised attempt to prove he wasn't lying about the severity of the foul is something a fighter of his stature shouldn't have to do.Men's pound-for-pound rankings1. Ilia Topuria -- Lightweight championRecord: 18-0 | Previous ranking: No. 1Topuria took a massive step forward in becoming the new face of the promotion by knocking out Charles Oliveira at UFC 317 in June to capture the vacant lightweight title. The first unbeaten, two-division champion in UFC history just might have the most technical and explosive boxing skills the Octagon has ever seen. Topuria appears on his way toward becoming the biggest MMA star since Conor McGregor and is expected to headline the first major card of 2026. \n2. Merab Dvalishvili -- Bantamweight championRecord: 21-4 | Previous ranking: No. 2It's scary to think about but, at age 34, \"The Machine\" only continues to get better as his 135-pound title reign continues. Five months after he outpointed unbeaten Umar Nurmagomedov despite an injured back, Dvalishvili submitted former champion Sean O'Malley in their June rematch at UFC 316. A third title defense of 2025 came in October when he outpointed Cory Sandhagen. Dvalishvili's cardio might be unlike anyone else in UFC history.\n3. Islam Makhachev -- WelterweightRecord: 27-1 | Previous ranking: No. 3Makhachev chose to vacate his 155-pound title despite the presence of former featherweight king Ilia Topuria moving up to his division. At 33, Makhachev is looking to add to his increasingly legendary résumé by competing for a title in a second weight class. He will challenge new welterweight champion Jack Della Maddalena this fall with a shot at equaling Anderson Silva's UFC record of 16 consecutive wins at November's UFC 322 card  in New York.4. Alex Pereira -- Light heavyweightRecord: 12-3 | Previous ranking: No. 4Talk about a comeback victory. The 37-year-old Brazilian slugger had looked sluggish in a decision loss against the technical Magomed Ankalaev in March. Vowing to return at full health after competing at just 40% of himself, Pereira wasted no time in finishing Ankalaev in their October rematch at UFC 320 to regain the title and call for a much-anticipated move up to heavyweight and a third title in as many divisions.\n5. Khamzat Chimaev -- Middleweight championRecord: 15-0 | Previous ranking: No. 5Despite years of inactivity due to injury, illness and bad luck, Chimaev proved at UFC 319 in August just how dangerous he truly is when fully healthy. He also shut up any critics wondering if he possessed five-round cardio by utterly dominating Dricus du Plessis on the ground in a shutout decision. While many fans referred to the gameplan that Chimaev executed against DDP as boring, the performance sent a stern message to the rest of the pack at 185 pounds that Chimaev is ready to begin a new era.6. Alexandre Pantoja -- Flyweight championRecord: 31-5 | Previous ranking: No. 6Aging like a fine wine, the 35-year-old native of Brazil recorded his fourth title defense with a submission of Kai Kara-France at UFC 317 in June. The victory moved Pantoja into first place for most victories, finishes and submissions in flyweight history. A showdown against red-hot contender Joshua Van is next as Pantoja continues to add on to his legacy during this late career renaissance.\n7. Alexander Volkanovski -- Featherweight championRecord: 27-4 | Previous ranking: No. 7A 14-month layoff did the 36-year-old Volkanovski good as he rebounded from a pair of knockout losses to the two best fighters in the world by brilliantly outpointing Diego Lopes to capture the vacant 145-pound title at UFC 314 in April. Now a two-time champion, Volkanovski proved, even this late in his career, that skills, IQ and timing can still defeat youth and power. \n8. Jack Della Maddalena -- Welterweight championRecord: 24-4, 1 NC | Previous ranking: No. 8Despite a 14-month layoff and close victories in his previous three fights, the Australian slugger became the class of the 170-pound division with his hard-fought decision win over Belal Muhammad at UFC 315 in May. Della Maddalena showed elite boxing and footwork yet it was his takedown defense which played the biggest role in JDM conquering such a deep division. His first title defense comes against Makhachev in November at UFC 322. 9. Dricus du Plessis -- MiddleweightRecord: 22-3 | Previous ranking: No. 9As impressive as du Plessis' first nine trips to the Octagon truly were, he proved quickly out of answers in yielding his middleweight title to unbeaten Khamzat Chimaev at UFC 319 in August. DDP simply had nothing for Chimaev on the ground and looked like a novice despite showing toughness and a willingness to keep fighting. A late rally in the closing seconds, aided by two referee standups, wasn't enough to save face in a one-sided dismantling.10. Tom Aspinall -- Heavyweight championRecord: 15-3 (1 NC) | Previous ranking: No. 10The 32-year-old British slugger with some of the fastest hands the division has seen finally earned undisputed champion status when Jon Jones vacated his title and briefly retired earlier this year. Aspinall, who previously defended his interim title last summer, returned in October to defend the belt against Cyril Gane at UFC 321. Unfortunately, a double eye poke late in Round 1 comprised Aspinall's vision and led to a no contest. \nDropped out: NoneJust missed: Umar Nurmagomedov, Magomed Ankalaev, Shavkat Rakhkmonov, Lerone Murphy, Max HollowayWomen's pound-for-pound rankings1. Valentina Shevchenko -- Flyweight championRecord: 24-4-1 | Previous ranking: No. 1The future Hall of Famer only continued to cement her legacy even further at UFC 315 in May when she outpointed the red-hot Manon Fiorot over five rounds. The 37-year-old Shevchenko, who improved her UFC record for title wins by a female with 10, also achieved her eighth title defense by making the championship adjustments when it mattered most. A superfight against strawweight queen Zhang Weili is on tap for UFC 322 in New York.2. Zhang Weili -- Strawweight championRecord: 25-3 | Previous ranking: No. 2Zhang improved to 10-0 in the UFC against everyone not named Rose Namajunas when she dominated unbeaten Tatiana Suarez over five rounds at UFC 312 in February. At 35, Zhang only continues to round out her game and plans to attempt to prove so by moving up to 125 pounds in hopes of becoming a two-division champion. Zhang will challenge Valentina Shevchenko for the flyweight title at UFC 322 in November.\n3. Kayla Harrison -- Bantamweight championRecord: 19-1 | Previous ranking: No. 3Despite enduring an insane cut to make championship weight of 135 pounds, Harrison dominated two-time champion Juianna Pena at UFC 316 in June to capture the women's bantamweight title. A showdown against former champion (and former teammate) Amanda Nunes appears to be next as MMA's female G.O.A.T. returns to the sport at age 37. Either way, Harrison's inspirational story of persevering provided a true feel-good moment.\n4. Manon Fiorot -- FlyweightRecord: 13-2 | Previous ranking: No. 4The 35-year-old native of France snapped an impressive 7-0 start to her UFC career by coming up just short in a close decision loss to champion Valentina Shevchenko at UFC 315 in June. But, to Fiorot's credit, her October return against a streaking Jasmine Jasudavicius was a stark reminder at how talented and title-ready she remains. Fiorot recorded a first-round TKO in a showcase of her explosive boxing skills.5. Natalia Silva -- FlyweightRecord: 19-5-1 | Previous ranking: No. 5Unbeaten in seven trips to the Octagon, Silva earned a decision in May at UFC 315 against former champion Alexa Grasso to put the 28-year-old native of Brazil in position for a possible title shot. The dynamic striker has won 13 fights in a row overall since a 2017 loss on the regional scene to Marina Rodriguez and remains a difficult test for any flyweight given her speed, feints and accurate strikes. \nDropped out: NoneJust missed: Erin Blanchfield, Mackenzie Dern, Julianna Pena, Alexa Grasso, Tatiana Suarez\n            ",

Kesler pleaded not guilty to two misdemeanor counts of fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct on Monday in Bloomfield Hills District in Michigan.Kesler has posted $50,000 bond and isn't permitted to leave the stage of Michigan unless he has permission from the court. The former NHL center is scheduled to appear in court on Nov. 6.Kesler has dismissed the charges, which were filed last week. The charges are related to an alleged incident that took place on Jan. 1 in Orchard Lake, Michigan, per the court records. The alleged incident was reported on Jan. 2 to police and no other details have been made public.\n\"Ryan emphatically denies the allegations and is completely innocent of the charges,\" Kesler's attorney Robert Morad told The Athletic. \"As the legal process begins, we ask for respect for his privacy and for the integrity of the judicial system. We are confident, when all the facts and circumstances are presented, that he will be fully exonerated.\"Kesler has been suspended from his position as a youth hockey coach by the Michigan Amateur Hockey Association. In addition, association president Tom Berry also informed The Athletic that Kesler has been suspended from all USA Hockey-related activities. Kesler has coached the Little Caesars AAA Hockey Club 15O Bantam Midget team for the past three seasons.\nKesler, 41, played 15 NHL seasons for the Vancouver Canucks and Anaheim Ducks from 2003 to 2019. He compiled 258 goals and 315 assists throughout his career, while also appearing in two NHL All-Star Games. Kesler won the Selke Award in 2010-11, which is annually given to the league's top defensive forward.\n            \n    ",

The news builds on the deal announced between the companies in August.The union between Paramount and the UFC kicks off at the start of 2026. Under the deal, Paramount will exclusively distribute UFC's full slate of 13 marquee numbered events and 30 Fight Nights via its direct-to-consumer streaming platform Paramount+, eliminating the pay-per-view model that has been the distribution method for nearly every UFC numbered event. Some marquee events will also be simulcast on CBS.\"The partnership with Paramount has already been incredible and it just keeps getting bigger and better,\" UFC President and CEO Dana White said in a press release announcing the expansion. \"They are now taking on new territories like Latin America and Australia and this thing is just going to continue to grow. It just shows you how aggressive they are with this business, and I love it. I can't wait to continue working together and building the next generation of talent all over the world.\"Brazil is among those countries covered in the Latin American deal. Brazil has a deep history in mixed martial arts, with nearly 20 Brazilian fighters having held UFC championships, a number that climbs to 23 if counting tournament champions such as Royce Gracie in the earliest days of the UFC.\nAustralia has seen an uptick in champions and contenders in recent years, with three Australian fighters having held championship gold.\"Delivering premium UFC programming to audiences on a global scale remains a top priority for Paramount,\" Cindy Holland, Chair of Direct-To-Consumer, Paramount said in the press release. \"We are thrilled to expand upon the historic offering of UFC content for Paramount+ subscribers across all plans to more passionate and engaged fans around the world.\"\nDetails of the debut event in the partnership will be revealed in the coming weeks.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Toronto Blue Jays lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers in heartbreaking fashion in the early hours of Tuesday morning, dropping Game 3 of the World Series by a 6-5 final in 18 innings. Dodgers first baseman Freddie Freeman played the hero by launching a walk-off home run to begin the bottom of the 18th, yet it was Shohei Ohtani who had yet another game for the history books.Indeed, Ohtani became the first player in Major League Baseball history to reach base nine times. He also became the first player to record four extra-base hits in a single World Series game since 1906, and the first player ever to hit multiple home runs in three games as part of a single postseason. Just as important as what Ohtani did during the first half of Game 3 is how the Blue Jays responded in the second half: issuing him five walks, with four of them registering as intentional in nature.\n        \n            \n                The Blue Jays don't want to face Shohei Ohtani, but they'll have no choice in World Series Game 4\n                \n                    Julian McWilliams                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAfterward, Blue Jays manager John Schneider explained his rationale.\"His performance was really good. He's arguably the best player on the planet, you know. I think you kind of react in real time a little bit,\" Schneider said. \"Again, man, they have a really talented lineup. It's not the easiest thing in the world to just walk him and face Mookie and Freddie. So every situation is different. You got to really execute at a high level against him. I think the first couple games we did. I know he hit the homer off [Braydon Fisher] in Game 1, but I think that we executed pretty well minus today, and he's a great player and took some really good swings today.\"\nDodgers manager Dave Roberts, for his part, said he understood why Schneider took this path.\n\"No, I get it. He's the best player on the planet, and he was on the heels of a huge offensive night, and John smelled that and wasn't going to let Shohei beat him at all, obviously, and even when nobody's on base and putting him on to make the other guys beat him,\" Roberts said. \"Respect it and, fortunately, we have other guys behind Shohei that can still do some things and, yeah, I mean, a hard-fought game.\"Schneider also confirmed that he may continue to take the bat out of Ohtani's hands, thereby forcing other Dodgers hitters to step up. Is that a wise decision, and how can the Dodgers counter? Let's turn to some subheads.1. Game 3 walks worked outAs noted, the Blue Jays walked Ohtani in each of his last five trips to the plate in Game 3. That included four intentional walks and one, the final, that came on four pitches -- an unintentional intentional walk by most definitions. Here's a quick breakdown of the base-out state for each of those walks:\nInningBasesOuts9thEmpty111thEmpty213th__3215thEmpty117th1__2In all but one of those cases, the Blue Jays opted to take their chances with Mookie Betts. (They intentionally walked Betts to face Freddie Freeman in the other situation.) Betts singled once after an intentional walk, but otherwise had a miserable game, going 1 for 8 with a walk and a strikeout. From a results-based perspective, Schneider's gambles paid off time and again. That doesn't mean Schneider should simply walk Ohtani every time he comes to the plate, however.2. Intentional walks are easy to misuse While acknowledging the approach worked in Game 3, it's worth remembering that Ohtani did make outs in more than 60% of his plate appearances during the regular season. Heck, it wasn't that long ago that he was having a rough go in the postseason against the Philadelphia Phillies and Milwaukee Brewers. Realistically, automatically putting him on base each time plays into the Dodgers' hands more than not. Why? In part because Ohtani is a capable thief who can singlehandedly put himself into scoring position. And, in part, because the Dodgers have a stacked lineup. Sure, Betts has had a down year and postseason by his standards, and neither Freeman nor Will Smith has cleared an .800 OPS this postseason, but those are descriptive and not predictive statistics. All three batters have a lengthy track record of producing, and gifting them prime run-scoring opportunities is a strategy that won't hold over a large enough denominator.Put another way, there's a reason that most studies on this matter have shown that there are a few prime situations for an intentional walk -- when an elite hitter has zero protection behind him, or when they can be put on base without advancing another runner to set up a double-play situation -- and are, largely, otherwise bad value propositions. To wit, MLB's Mike Petriello found earlier this postseason that the intentional walk strategy generally hadn't paid off for teams3. How Dodgers can counterYou might wonder how the Dodgers can combat the Blue Jays' strategy of taking the bat from Ohtani's hands. The answer is, well, to take advantage of the free baserunner.Betts' continued struggles would seem to give Roberts an incentive to make a lineup change, perhaps flipping him with Smith (so the Dodgers can continue to break up their lefties) or even with Teoscar Hernández. It's not clear that Roberts is even considering such a move, though, based on what he said concerning Ohtani's intentional walks.\"I think it's all relative. Barry [Bonds] is the greatest hitter I've ever seen, but this day and age, there's just him or maybe [Aaron] Judge,\" Roberts said after Game 3. \"But, yeah, I think that we're just fortunate we have Mookie and Freddie behind him. But you just don't see that type of behavior from opposing managers and that's just the ultimate sign of respect.\"It stands to reason that Roberts wouldn't specifically mention Betts and Freeman, in that order, if he were contemplating flip-flopping the two (or Betts with anyone else). Perhaps that's reading too much into his words after an 18-inning game, but, should that prove correct, it means that it's on Betts to atone for some lackluster play this October and help deliver Los Angeles a second consecutive World Series title.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Deion Sanders had no explanation for Colorado's failure to show up over the weekend at Utah, a disheartening loss for the Buffaloes that raises doubts during a season that began with great optimism in Boulder.  Should this be a sign of things to come for a program struggling through a top-heavy Big 12 schedule with questions surrounding personnel, execution and trajectory?  After winning nine games last fall culminating with their first appearance in the Alamo Bowl since 2020, the Buffaloes are two losses away from missing the postseason for the second time in three years under Sanders. They host Arizona on Saturday, whose lost consecutive one-possession games against BYU and Houston. Here are three burning questions facing Coach Prime the rest of the way after a discussion with BuffStampede publisher Adam Munsterteiger this week:1. Will Sanders make tough managerial decisions?Scheduled to be a retooling year after losing Shedeur Sanders and Heisman winner Travis Hunter to the NFL Draft, Colorado is enduring an unexpected rebuild that could lead to a full teardown of several processes if lackluster play continues. Sanders struggled to pinpoint why his team was losing close games early, before Saturday night's no-show at Utah sounded several alarms.\nThe 46-point drubbing was the worst loss of his coaching career and brought immediate accountability from the third-year coach. Uninspired, unprepared and overmatched, the Buffaloes trailed 43-0 at halftime coming out of an open date -- a poor look considering they had just beaten Iowa State earlier this month to snap a two-game Big 12 skid.\"There has been a lack of leadership in the locker room this season, and that showed itself in Salt Lake City,\" Munsterteiger told CBS Sports. \"Sanders has shown a willingness to make tough decisions and changes with his coaching staff previously. I would expect there to be adjustments to his staff in the near future, whether that comes in the next month or after the season.\"Sanders hasn't yet made a coordinator change at Colorado, but this season may call for one. Charles Kelly left for an assistant position at Auburn in 2023 following Colorado's 4-8 finish, after which Sanders hired Robert Livingston -- formerly a secondary coach with the Bengals -- to run his defense.\nPat Shurmur has been with Sanders since his arrival from Jackson State, initially serving as an offensive analyst before Sean Lewis was demoted from his OC role and later departed to become head coach at San Diego State.Colorado hasn't met expectations this season, and the onus will be on Sanders to make changes where he deems fit at year's end.2. Can Colorado's struggling offense be fixed?The Buffaloes have played musical chairs at quarterback this season, hoping Liberty transfer Kaidon Salter or veteran Ryan Staub would take control of the position. Instead, Colorado ranks 14th in the Big 12 in passing offense, scoring offense and explosive plays. The offensive line remains a problem, and the lack of a running game -- 99th nationally at 130 yards per game -- leaves the offense at a schematic disadvantage.\nCoy with his quarterback decision early on -- outside of admitting freshman Julian Lewis wasn't ready -- Sanders has turned to Salter for the last five games. That came after Staub came off the bench to spark a win over Delaware in Week 2 before losing his only start at Houston the following weekend.In four Big 12 starts, Salter has thrown five touchdown passes with five interceptions, while his dual-threat ability has been limited to just 2.4 yards per carry.\"All four of Colorado's remaining regular-season opponents rank seventh or worse in the Big 12 in scoring defense, so that could help,\" Munsterteiger said. \"But it's hard to have much faith in Colorado's offense at this point, between Pat Shurmur's unimaginative play-calling and Kaidon Salter's inconsistent play behind center.\"\nOmarion Miller and Joseph Williams lead the team in catches, yards and touchdowns, but the absence of game-breaking production that Travis Hunter, LaJohntay Wester, Will Sheppard and Jimmy Horn Jr. provided last season has been glaring.That's not all on play-calling, but the explosive plays simply haven't been there — outside of a few catch-and-runs from Miller and a 71-yard reception from Sincere Brown. With his arm talent, Shedeur Sanders was able to mask many of Colorado's deficiencies in 2024, weaknesses that have been magnified in his absence.3. Does Sanders have job security?Considering Sanders signed a five-year, $54 million extension this spring that pushed him into college football's top 10 highest-paid coaches, he's not going anywhere from a performance standpoint. He's not on the hot seat, and Colorado's administration understands he's already elevated the program beyond anything it's seen in more than a decade in terms of national relevance. Still, like any head coach following what's shaping up to be a losing season, Sanders will be expected to make changes to his staff.\n\"Colorado won nine games under Sanders in 2024, just two years after the Buffaloes fielded the worst FBS program, so there needs to be some big-picture perspective,\" Munsterteiger said. \"Despite the team's disappointing 3-5 start, Coach Prime has proven he can attract talent to Boulder. They'll need to find more leadership out of the portal this offseason, and Sanders will likely have to make some tough staff decisions.\"From a health standpoint, Sanders told The Associated Press this week that he's only focused on winning and is a \"one-day-at-a-time type of guy\" when it comes to his future next season and beyond.\"My health is not going to increase sitting on the lake fishing,\" Sanders said. \"My health is not going to increase sitting at my property in Texas, having a good time or sitting back, drinking some sweet iced teas and eating some honey buns and watching television. I'm not damaging or putting my health at risk by doing what I'm doing. Matter of fact, it's enhancing my health, doing the things I do.\"\nAfter a loss to TCU earlier this month, Sanders said he was \"hurting like crazy\" due to pain associated with blood clots in his legs. He underwent emergency surgery to treat persistent blood clots in June 2023 and previously had two toes amputated at Jackson State as a result of similar issues.Sanders also beat bladder cancer over the summer, and he insists his ongoing health challenges don't interfere with his goal of building Colorado into a national power.\"I don't get too high and I never get too low,\" Sanders said this week. \"I have the baseball player's mentality. Football players, you can bask in the glory for six days when you win, or you have to suffer the consequences for six days if you lose. But a baseball player -- you've got to line up every day.\"\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    BuffStampede's team of insiders provide Colorado fans behind the scenes scoop on all the latest happenings surrounding the Buffaloes.

The Giants' intentions on Thibodeaux were reported by NFL Network's Mike Garafolo, citing teams that had reached out to Big Blue to gauge their interest in a potential trade.Thibodeaux, the No. 5-overall pick out of Oregon in the 2022 NFL Draft and the very first draft pick by general manager Joe Schoen, had his fifth-year option picked up earlier this year to keep him with the Giants through 2026. Although Thibodeaux has been a popular name bandied about in regards to Giants trade rumors -- particularly given the team's additional moves at outside linebacker by trading for Brian Burns and drafting Abdul Carter -- the team reportedly intends to have Thibodeaux in 2026 as he enters the final year of his rookie contract.The drafting of Thibodeaux was the first major step the Giants took towards building a formidable pass rush and defensive line, and Thibodeaux has answered the call to step up this year. Not only does Thibodeaux have 2.5 sacks so far this year, but he has also made five tackles for loss, nine quarterback hits, and two pass deflections while developing into one of the Giants' best run defenders on the outside.\nThibodeaux also contributed to the development of the Giants' attitude with his outspokenness, particularly against the team's biggest rival in the Philadelphia Eagles. Thibodeaux earned points among the Giants fanbase by declaring \"F--- them Eagles!\" after the team's Week 6 upset win in a Thursday night game, and he was also candid following their rematch after a \"bulls---\" forward progress call robbed Thibodeaux of a forced fumble on a Tush Push.\n            \n    ",

Not only did the Sun Devils lose 24-16 to Houston, giving them two losses in conference play, but they also saw quarterback Sam Leavitt get banged up. Leavitt spent time in the medical tent after Arizona State's first drive and left the game again in the fourth quarter after he came off the field with a bit of a limp. While Arizona State didn't provide much in the way of specifics on Leavitt's injury, Kenny Dillingham said it's a tweak of the same foot or ankle injury that forced him to sit out against Utah earlier this season. The tweak is significant enough to keep him out of Saturday's game against Iowa State, per CBS Sport's Matt Zenitz and Chris Karpman of 247Sports. \"Sam got re-tweaked there at the end,\" Dillingham said. \"He got tweaked at the beginning and we sent him in to get some imaging.

Then at the end, he tweaked himself again, so we held him out.\"Jeff Sims came in for Leavitt at the end of the loss to Houston and would be in line to get the start on the road in Ames if Leavitt indeed is unable to go. Leavitt has completed 60.7% of his passes for 1,628 yards, 10 touchdowns and three interceptions this season and has added 300 yards and five touchdowns running the ball. \nSims completed 49% of his passes for 182 yards and one touchdown in his two appearances, including the start against Utah, and rushed for 102 yards. The veteran journeyman seems poised for another start against Iowa State in a game Arizona State must win if they're going to hold out any hopes of another trip to the Big 12 title game. \n            \n    ",

It was a relatively new Jet that made the game-sealing play, as cornerback Jarvis Brownlee Jr. broke up a Joe Flacco pass on a fourth-and-9 with 27 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter.\nThe Tennessee Titans send Brownlee to New York in a surprising trade last month. Tennessee shipped a seventh-round pick and Brownlee to the Jets in exchange for a sixth-round pick, which was unexpected given Brownlee is a young talent on a rookie contract that was starting for the Titans. Brownlee clearly feels some type of way about being jettisoned from the team that selected him in the fifth round last year, as The Athletic's Zack Rosenblatt revealed that the cornerback took a shot at his former team after the game on Sunday. \nApparently, Brownlee asked reporters what time it was while speaking in the locker room. When they responded saying it was a bit before five o'clock, Brownlee said, \"Oh great, so I still have time to go watch the Titans lose.\" \nThe Titans and Indianapolis Colts kicked off at 4:25 p.m. ET, and the Titans did indeed lose, 38-14. While the Jets and Titans have the same record at 1-7, it's clear Brownlee is happy to be in New York. \nThe 24-year-old corner has made an instant impact with his new team. In four games played for the Jets, Brownlee has recorded 19 tackles, two passes defensed and one forced fumble. \n            \n    ",

Shough makes his first career start Sunday against the Los Angeles Rams.Rattler heads to the bench with a 1-13 record as a starting quarterback, which is tied for the second-worst record by a quarterback in their first 14 career starts since 1950. Shough replaced Rattler Sunday in the third quarter of the Saints' eventual 23-3 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and completed 15 of 21 passes for 136 yards and one interception. Coach Kellen Moore said after the game he make the QB swap in hopes of sparking the offense. \"We just needed to find a way to create something on offense,\" Moore said. \"It has more to do with the offense collectively. We're just not executing and playing at a high enough standard and we gotta find a way to move the football consistently, protect the football and score points. This is a pure full offensive evaluation point. We're just not there.\"\nShough is the second-highest drafted quarterback by the Saints in the common draft era behind Archie Manning, who was selected No. 2 overall in 1971. In the preseason quarterback battle, he completed 66.7% of his passes for 333 yards, and accounted for two total touchdowns and two turnovers.Shough is an older rookie at 26 years old. Last year at Louisville, he completed 62.7% of his passes for 3,195 yards, 23 touchdowns and six interceptions. Shough left the college ranks with a 21-11 career record as starter in games played for Oregon, Texas Tech and Louisville.\nThe 1-7 Saints are off to their worst eight-game start since 1999, which was their final season under Mike Ditka. New Orleans ranks No. 27 in total offense (295 yards per game) and No. 29 in scoring offense (16 points per game).\n            \n    ",

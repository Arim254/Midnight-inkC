    "body": "\n        All eyes will be on Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., when the New England Patriots take on the Seattle Seahawks in the Big Game. It's an unlikely matchup after the Patriots came into the season off back-to-back 4-13 seasons and hadn't been to the NFL playoffs since the 2021 season. Seattle hadn't been to the playoffs since the 2022 season, but made huge strides in the second season under head coach Mike Macdonald and quarterback Sam Darnold, a free-agent acquisition.Kickoff is at 6:30 p.m. ET on Sunday, Feb. 8. The latest Seahawks vs. Patriots odds from DraftKings Sportsbook list Seattle as the 4.5-point favorite, with the over/under at 45.5 points. The Seahawks are -230 money line favorites (risk $230 to win $100), while the Patriots are +190 underdogs. Darnold is the +120 favorite to win Big Game MVP, with Patriots quarterback Drake Maye second at +240. SportsLine's NFL experts teamed up to give exact score projections for the Big Game, and while they're unanimously backing the Seahawks to win, their score predictions lead to some different spread and total picks. \nThe team of NFL betting experts includes R.J. White, who is SportsLine's all-time No. 1 NFL spread expert and Larry Hartstein, who enters the game on a 43-33 run on NFL ATS picks (+596). Other NFL betting experts featured include Alex 'PropStarz' Selesnick, who is on a 62-44 (+916) roll on NFL player props and Jeff Hochman, who is 83-66-3 (plus +1217) over the past four NFL seasons.Now, SportsLine's NFL experts have analyzed the NFL odds and locked in their final score predictions for Seahawks vs. Patriots. Patriots vs. Seahawks score predictionsR.J. White Big Game score prediction: Seahawks 19, Patriots 16\"The last four Big Games have seen both teams get to 20 points, but I think there's a chance touchdowns will be hard to come by in this game. The Seahawks defense is elite, allowing just two touchdowns in the six games since Week 12 where they haven't faced the Rams. The Patriots defense has risen to that level in the postseason thanks to getting key players back in the front seven as well as playcaller Zak Kuhr putting on a masterclass each week. There's no denying the talent on these offenses, but I see two defensive units that will be tough to crack in the red zone and a lot of kicking points in this game.\" New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins, and target the Patriots +4.5: \nLarry Hartstein Big Game score prediction: Seahawks 23, Patriots 16\"It's been four months since a team not named the Rams excelled offensively versus Seattle's No. 1 defense. Unless Drake Maye runs wild, I have a hard time seeing the Patriots getting to 20 points. New England's defense is stout too, with a front that shuts down the run and Christian Gonzalez patrolling the back end. But Seattle has better weapons, led by the unstoppable Jaxon-Smith Njigba. He, Rashid Shaheed and Cooper Kupp will make enough plays to complete the Sam Darnold redemption story.\" You can bet Seahawks (-4.5) at DraftKings:\nJeff HochmanBig Game score prediction: Seahawks 27, Patriots 20\"Seattle's edge in Net Yards Per Play (+1.4 vs. +1.0) is even more impressive considering they played the fourth-toughest schedule, while New England had the league's easiest. Since 2000, just four teams have captured the title with a negative sack differential, while teams with a +20 or higher sack differential -- such as Seattle -- have won six times. The Patriots' sack differential of -13 is the lowest ever for a championship team in this span. After monitoring both teams all season, Seattle appears superior in every phase: offense, defense and special teams.\" You can go Over on the total (45.5) at DraftKings:\nAlex 'PropStarz' Selesnick Big Game score prediction: Seahawks 23, Patriots 19\"This looks like a game where both offenses could find it difficult to score touchdowns. New Englands defense has been dominant through the playoffs and features the type of scheme and personnel that could potentially give Sam Darnold fits coupled with limiting Seattle's run game. I also expect Mike McDonald's defense to make life really difficult on Drake Maye who has not been same player that was a bonafide MVP candidate through the entirety of the regular season. I think this is ultimately a low scoring game decided by 4 points or less. The Seahawks have been very fortunate in high leverage situations and I do expect some major regression in the turnover department, however that may not come to fruition until next season. Seattle feels like a team of destiny.\" You can pick Under (45.5) the total at DraftKings:\nHow to get more Patriots vs. Seahawks picksSportsLine's model has simulated Seahawks vs. Patriots 10,000 times and revealed its picks. See who wins and covers the spread here, all from the model that's on a 53-37 roll on top-rated NFL picks. \n            ",

The Bulls added Jaden Ivey from the Pistons and Anfernee Simons from the Celtics, giving them more firepower to keep pace with Nikola Jokic and the Nuggets. Jokic had 30 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists against the Knicks on Wednesday. The Nuggets have gone Over in five straight games, and these teams have gone Over in five straight head-to-head meetings. The model has them combining for 241 points on Saturday night, as the Over hits in 60% of simulations. Back the Over at bet365 here:Illinois (+1.5) vs. Michigan State\"Michigan State has lost its only two conference games against ranked opponents (Michigan and Nebraska). They have feasted on the bottom of the Big Ten, inflating their defensive stats,\" SportsLine expert Jeff Hochman said. \"When faced with a Tier-1 offense (like Michigan's), their defense cracked. Illinois presents an even more potent offensive challenge than Michigan. Close Game Separation Metrics heavily favor Illinois. In tight games, Illinois has consistently executed in the half-court, whereas Michigan State has suffered from subpar backcourt play from everyone not named Jeremy Fears Jr. Illinois has validated these numbers away from home. Their Strength of Schedule adjusted performance includes road wins at Purdue and Nebraska—two of the toughest environments in the Big Ten. I like the road team in this spot.\" Back Illinois at bet365 here:\nLooking for more NBA and college basketball picks?You've seen the model's best bets for Saturday.

In a preseason friendly facing Barcelona FC -- the Ecuadorian Barcelona -- Messi scored quite a goal during Inter Miami's 2-2 draw with the club. He also added an assist to new forward German Berterame, which will be a connection that is used plenty during the season as the Herons will look to stay at the top of the league after winning the MLS Cup for the first time in club history in December of 2025.Messi's goal was quite a sight to see, with the Argentine taking the ball on the dribble from the center circle before beating a defender and delivering a devastating finish to beat Barcelona keeper Jose Contreras in the net. \nAfter a season where Messi won the MLS MVP award for the second consecutive season, he scored plenty of goals from every angle imaginable. Messi tallied the second-most goal contributions in league history with 48 from 29 goals and 19 assists, while also becoming the second player in league history to lead the league in both goals and assists alongside Sebastian Giovinco.\nThere's no question that as Messi gears up for the 2026 season with Miami and prepares to lead Argentina at the World Cup, he's still got plenty in his legs to torture defenders around the league. With Miami set to move to their new stadium, Miami Freedom Park, in April of this year, things are only getting bigger and better for the Herons.As always, pressure will be on Miami to succeed, but with more goals like this one in store during the season, they're set to pick up where they left off at the end of last campaign while taking part in Concacaf Champions Cup, Leagues Cup, and MLS play.\nMiami will kick off their regular season by travelling to Los Angeles to face Heung-min Son and Los Angeles FC on Saturday, Feb. 21. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Jungle serenaded Charles Bediako with \"G League dropout\" amid his ongoing eligibility case, but it was former Auburn guard Aden Holloway who helped Bediako and the Crimson Tide notch the last laugh in Saturday's Iron Bowl of Basketball. Alabama knocked off Auburn 96-92 behind nine straight points from Holloway in the final three minutes. Holloway, who jumped into enemy lines when he transferred from Auburn to Alabama ahead of the 2023-24 season, delivered the dagger with a four-point play right in front of Auburn's raucous student section.The road team has now won each of the past three iterations of the Iron Bowl of Basketball. For Alabama, it's a coming-of-age caliber of victory for a team that has not played 40 good minutes just once in the past month or so with injuries eliminating any ounce of lineup continuity and the Bediako debacle looming over each day.Bediako was in court Friday for his lawsuit against the NCAA, but since Tuscaloosa Circuit Court Judge Daniel Pruet didn't deliver a ruling, he was allowed to suit up for Alabama for at least one more day. The 7-footer came off the bench and delivered 12 points and three boards in 22 minutes, just over 24 hours after listening to the NCAA lawyers argue for him to be barred from college basketball.\n\"If we're being intellectually honest, it's about money,\" NCAA lawyer Taylor Askew argued in Friday's hearing as a rebuttal to Bediako's representatives' claim that his client would lose out on basketball and educational opportunities if Bediako's temporary injunction for the rest of the year was not approved.\nAlabama's March Madness upside is certainly lower without Bediako, because Saturday showed what the Tide is capable of if they can keep Bediako in the lineup and start to gel.Future NBA lead guard Labaron Philon delivered a brilliant 25-point, six-assist, five-rebound showing. Future NBA wing Amari Allen was awesome, burying three triples and finishing with 17 points. Add in a former professional center in Bediako, and Alabama has three pros at three different positions. Oh, and Holloway. Oh, and Houston Mallette is one of many Alabama snipers who can have a big day as well. He canned two massive triples at the end of the first half to help erase Auburn's 10-point advantage.The Jungle gave Alabama its best growl, but Alabama's showing spoke volumes.\n\"They were pretty quiet when we left today,\" Crimson Tide coach Nate Oats said. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Kirk Cousins' time with the Atlanta Falcons is nearing its end. The franchise is reportedly set to cut the veteran quarterback before the start of the new league year in March. This will conclude a rather muted tenure in Atlanta for Cousins. He was signed to a four-year, $180 million deal back in 2024, and just months later saw the organization draft Michael Penix Jr. with the No. 8 overall pick at the NFL Draft. That instantly put a ceiling on Cousins' tenure with the Falcons, and he eventually made way for Penix in Week 16 of that year. Penix then started the first nine games of the 2025 season, but a torn ACL put him on season-ending IR and brought Cousins back into the fold as the starter. Over his 10 appearances, the 37-year-old complted 61.7% of his passes with an 84.8 passer rating, while going 5-3 over his eight starts. While Cousins is certainly not at his apex, he's a competent starter, which means he'll have a market once he becomes a free agent following his pending release by the Falcons. So, where could he end up? Let's dive into a handful of possible landing spots. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Pittsburgh Steelers The jury is still out on whether or not Aaron Rodgers will be back for his 22nd season in the NFL or if he'll opt for retirement as he's alluded to throughout the 2025 season. If he does call it quits, the Steelers aren't in a strong position to find a quarterback of the future at the 2026 NFL Draft, owning the 21st overall pick. With that in mind, the front office could do what they've done over the last few offseasons and bring in veteran quarterbacks. They did it with Russell Wilson in 2024 and Aaron Rodgers last year, and it would seem like Cousins fits that similar profile they've targeted in the past. With Mike McCarthy now installed as head coach, Cousins' skillset would also seem to fit his system pretty seamlessly. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Minnesota VikingsWho says you can't go back? The Minnesota Vikings are on the heels of firing general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah, which was due, in part, to the team bungling their quarterback situation and picking 2024 first-round pick J.J. McCarthy over Sam Darnold. With Adofo-Mensah, arguably McCarthy's biggest proponent, out the door, it stands to wonder how strong the rising third-year quarterback's footing is within the organization. After all, McCarthy finished last in completion percentage, TD-INT ratio, and passer rating in 2025. The Vikings will likely give McCarthy another shot to prove himself as the franchise centerpiece in 2026, but you better believe they'll look for insurance if he falters yet again. Cousins, who played for the Vikings from 2018 to 2023, knows Kevin O'Connell's system and could come in as a backup with the possibility to ascend as the starter if McCarthy proves to be a bust.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Miami DolphinsThe Dolphins are widely expected to move on from Tua Tagovailoa this offseason as the organization is ushering in a new era with GM John-Eric Sullivan and head coach Jeff Hafley. In a perfect world, this reset for Miami would feature the franchise also bringing in a young quarterback, but this crop of signal-callers at the 2026 NFL Draft isn't projected to have someone available to them, especially at No. 11 overall. Moreover, the Dolphins are currently projected to be roughly $16.4 million over the salary cap, and a looming departure of Tagovailoa will leave a lofty dead cap charge. That means they also don't have the financial flexibility to bring in another higher-caliber, more expensive option that could become available, either, making Cousins a logical target as a short-term bridge quarterback.  \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New York JetsThe Jets are currently lost at sea and without a paddle when it comes to the quarterback position. The Justin Fields experiment in 2025 blew up in their face, and, while they possess the No. 2 overall pick at the 2026 NFL Draft, there will not be a quarterback worthy of that selection, particularly after Dante Moore decided to remain at Oregon. New York does have a projected $83.2 million in available cap space, so they could try to look for a higher-caliber quarterback, but if they strike out in that search, Cousins wouldn't be a bad consolation prize. He could hold down the fort for 2026 and give the franchise some stability at that position, while they use their collection of first-round picks this spring to fill other needs along the roster. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    San Francisco 49ersYou may not have expected to see the 49ers on this list, but let's explain why this shouldn't be ruled out. While we highlighted a few teams where Cousins could be a logical fit as a starter, there's a possibility that a starting job is not available to him this offseason, leaving him with the option of going somewhere as a backup if he wants to continue playing. Meanwhile, Mac Jones, San Francisco's current backup quarterback, impressed when coming in for the injured Brock Purdy this season, going 5-3 as the starter with a 97.4 passer rating over those appearances. The Niners are reportedly reluctant to trade Jones, but what if a team blows them out of the water? With Brock Purdy as the set-and-forget starter, you almost have to move Jones if a team comes in with a big offer. If they do and the 49ers ship him out of the Bay Area, they suddenly need a backup. Enter: Kirk Cousins. One of the worst-kept secrets in the NFL is Kyle Shanahan's affinity for Cousins after working with him as the OC in Washington for the first two years of his career. In fact, it was widely believed the 49ers were going to sign Cousins as a free agent in 2018, but traded for Jimmy Garoppolo before he reached the open market. Well, all these years later, Shanahan and Cousins could finally reunite, albeit with him as the backup.   \n            ",

    "body": "\n        No. 14 North Carolina stunned No. 4 Duke, 69-68, with a last-second go-ahead 3-pointer in Chapel Hill on Saturday to complete its largest comeback vs. the rival Blue Devils in 25 years. UNC trailed by as many as 13 points in the first half and at various points throughout the second half -- even with as little as six minutes left -- it seemed Duke had a firm hold on the game.Until it didn't.UNC stayed persistent and chipped away little by little before chasing Duke down for good courtesy of a corner 3 from Seth Trimble with 0.4 seconds remaining. Duke's last-ditch effort to force overtime ended with a bobbled inbounds that didn't result in a shot attempt.Here's how the Tar Heels, who lost all three matchups vs. Duke last season and entered the game 4-6 under fifth-year coach Hubert Davis, got a desperately needed win to punch back in one of the sport's best rivalries.All Duke earlyJust over six minutes into the game, the Blue Devils opened up an 18-5 lead to silence the noisy crowd inside the Dean Smith Center. In that span, five different Duke players scored points -- and that didn't include leading scorer Cameron Boozer. \nUNC closed the gap to 22-20 on the strength of a 15-2 run that got the crowd back into it. But Duke captured the momentum again going into the half with an impressive 19-9 run of its own in the final eight minutes of the first half. It led 41-29 going into the second half. That was one point shy of its largest lead of the game. Caleb Wilson keeps UNC afloatUNC's supporting cast around star forward Caleb Wilson has been stellar all season. But it was nonexistent in the first half. Wilson accounted for 17 of the team's 29 first-half points. The rest of the Tar Heels shot a woeful 4-of-20 from the field. Wilson was spectacular, though. So spectacular that UNC's 12-point deficit felt somehow miraculous not to be 20+ points. He hit tough mid-range fadeaway after tough mid-range fadeaway, reliably getting to his spot of comfort on the court. \nWilson led all scorers at the half. Only one other UNC player in the opening 20 minutes made more than two field goals.\"Caleb kept us around in the first half,\" Davis said after the game. \"We continued to fight. We were down. We didn't join the fight .... We continued to stick to it ... as we continue to cut into the lead, our confidence got better, our stops got better, our execution got better. And Henri stepped up, his ability to dominate points in the paint was huge. Caleb kept us in it.\"Veesaar comes aliveUNC's second-leading scorer, Henri Veesaar, had zero points on 0-of-2 shooting in the first half. A virtual no-show.\nVeesaar in the second half: team-high 13 points on 6-of-7 shooting, nine rebounds, one assist, one block. UNC went as Veesaar went in both halves -- and Veesaar went from a stone-cold zero to full-blown flamethrower down the stretch. None of his buckets were more critical than the 3 he hit just at the 1:40 mark of the second half to tie things up. It lifted the crowd up and seemed to breathe new life into a once-dead UNC team.\n\"Henri stepped up,\" Davis said postgame. \"I mean, he had zero rebounds in the first half, then a double-double in the second half. His ability to dominate points in the paint for us was huge.\"\nUNC gets key stop at critical timeDuke did not score a single point over the final 2:25, during which it went 0-for-3 with two missed layups and also failed to get a shot off as time expired at the end.That is in part attributable to Duke's inability to convert, but UNC deserves credit for its timely stops. Its last stand was arguably its biggest, as the Tar Heels defense stood tall and forced a tough contest on Boozer in an isolation situation. Boozer missed the bucket to help set UNC up with possession for the final go-ahead basket.\nDuke coach Jon Scheyer said after the game that Boozer in isolation was the play they wanted with the result they didn't. Boozer had 15 of his 24 points in the second half and finished with 11 rebounds, but was credited with two missed layups in the final 2:25.\nDixon dimes save the dayFreshman Tar Heels guard Derek Dixon was the unsung hero of the comeback. He had eight points and four assists -- all in the second half -- which included the penetration and pass that led to the game-winner. Check here how he attacks to the paint while four Duke defenders collapse, leaving Seth Trimble wide open in the corner for an easy bucket.\nDavis said postgame they run that exact play in practice all the time, and one of the options off it is a skip pass to the corner just as Dixon did. Trimble did his job by stepping into it and delivering the Duke dagger.\"That shot was made by the perfect person at the right time,\" Davis said. \"He's deserving of being remembered forever of the commitment and devotion he's made to his teammates, to his program, to the university, to the community.\" \nUNC closes like killersEven when things looked bleak for North Carolina early, at the half and late in the second half, it managed to persist. Davis said postgame that early in the game UNC was not totally engaged and getting the short straw of hustle plays. That flipped in the second half as it powered to the finish.\"We continued to fight,\" he said. \"One of the things we were missing [early] was, we didn't join the fight. Every 50/50 loose ball [Duke] was getting, ball was going on the ground and [Duke] was the first to get it. We just continued to stick to it. Every time we got knocked down we got up and we took a step forward.\"As we continued to cut into the lead, our confidence got better on both ends of the floor, our execution got better, our stops got better, our communicational defense got better, our rebounding got better ... and then Henri stepped up.\"\nUNC went on a 9-0 run in the final 2:25 to seal the win, during which it went 3-for-3 -- all on 3-pointers. Dixon made the first of those three and assisted on the other two.\n            ",

Over the course of those two weeks, athletes from 92 countries -- not including Russia or Belarus -- will compete in 16 different sports.At the 2022 Beijing Olympics, the United States finished tied for third in the gold medal count, just behind Norway and Germany. The U.S. brought home nine gold medals, which was tied with China in that category, but the Americans finished fifth in the overall medal count with 25.Team USA will try to improve upon those numbers in 2026, and they have some golden opportunities to do just that. Both the men's and women's hockey team should be in the running for a gold medal, Jordan Stolz is a favorite in speed skating, Chloe Kim is hitting the halfpipe in snowboarding and Mikaela Shiffrin will once again be on the ski slopes. And figure skaters Alysa Liu and Ilia Malinin have high potential to reach the podium.\nNorway will attempt to defend its title as the most awarded country in the Winter Olympics, both from 2022 and all-time. The Norwegians won 16 gold medals and 37 total medals at the Beijing Games four years ago, and they possess a large edge in the all-time medal count. Norway has won 148 gold medals and 406 total medals in its 24 appearances at the Winter Olympics. The Americans are a distant second with 330 total medals.Russian and Belarusian athletes are permitted to compete, but only as individuals under a neutral flag. They'll be classified as \"Individual Neutral Athletes,\" and their medals won't factor into the overall count. Russian and Belarusian teams are still banned from competing the Olympics.\nKeep track of the live medal count over the next couple weeks as the United States looks to fill up its trophy case while competing across Northern Italy.

    "body": "\n        The Atlanta Falcons are barreling toward another quarterback reset, and this one may finally bring clarity -- not just for the future of the position, but for Kirk Cousins' next act as well. According to ESPN, the Falcons are expected to release Cousins before the start of the new league year in March, a move that would allow the veteran quarterback to choose his next destination -- or decide whether he wants one at all -- while reopening the quarterback picture in Atlanta.That uncertainty looms especially large for Michael Penix Jr., the 2024 first-round pick who is recovering from a torn left ACL suffered in November. With a new front office and coaching staff now in place, Atlanta has yet to commit to Penix as its long-term starter, making Cousins' contractual situation one of the first dominoes to reportedly fall in defining the position's future.Atlanta recently restructured Cousins' contract in a way that made a breakup feel inevitable. His 2026 base salary was slashed from $35 million to $2.1 million, with the remaining $32.9 million pushed into 2027. That 2027 salary balloons to $67.9 million and becomes fully guaranteed if Cousins is still on the roster when the league year begins in mid-March. The Falcons, not surprisingly, are expected to avoid that scenario.Releasing Cousins gives Atlanta financial flexibility and gives Cousins something he has long valued: control. Few quarterbacks have navigated free agency better than the 37-year-old, who has consistently landed fully guaranteed deals. Whether that market still exists is an open question, but Cousins is expected to be open to continuing his playing career, while also weighing television opportunities -- including a postseason appearance on NFL on CBS -- and even retirement.\nOn the field, Cousins' stint in Atlanta was uneven but not ineffective. He completed 61% of his passes for 1,721 yards with 10 touchdowns and five interceptions this past season, going 5-3 in his starts. In 2024, Cousins opened the year as Atlanta's starter and made 14 starts before eventually ceding the job to Penix.That instability carried into 2025, when Penix started nine games before his season-ending knee injury forced Cousins back into the lineup. The Falcons went 3-6 with Penix under center, a split that only added to the questions facing the new regime.Those questions intensified after the Falcons fired coach Raheem Morris and general manager Terry Fontenot following a second straight 8-9 season. Atlanta hired Kevin Stefanski as coach and Ian Cunningham as general manager under new president of football Matt Ryan, who spent 14 seasons with the franchise and led it to a Super Bowl LI appearance. \nPenix has said he expects to be ready for the 2026 season opener, but Ryan has been careful not to anoint him the starter.\"Neither of us are the head coach of the football team, so we can't answer your question on that,\" Ryan said earlier this week while introducing general manager Ian Cunningham. \"But I think all of us are going to get together. Ian's been a part of it for, I guess, three days, and has had a lot on his plate during that time. I think as we start to get into this process and dive deeper into the roster, how it currently stands, where it's going in the future, I think those are conversations that'll be a part of it.\"Cousins' release would formally reopen the quarterback door in Atlanta. For Penix, it means opportunity paired with uncertainty. For Cousins, it means freedom. And for the Falcons, it underscores how unresolved the most important position on the roster remains, even as one expensive chapter appears ready to close.\n            ",

Some people come for the game day snacks and stay for the Super Bowl halftime show, which is historically the most-watched musical performance of the year.The halftime show has been headlined by some of the biggest artists of all-time and has brought us wild and iconic moments throughout the 60 year history of the Super Bowl. This year it will be Bad Bunny headlining, taking the stage at Levi's Stadium in Santa, Clara, California on Sunday, February 8. He has yet to announce any special guests, but often the performances have them. Some have speculated that rapper Cardi B, who he has the hit song \"I Like It\" with and is also dating Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs, could join him, but Bad Bunny hasn't given anything away.The three-time Grammy winner and the most-streamed artist in the world was announced as the headliner earlier this season.Last year during the big game, Kendrick Lamar took the stage in New Orleans. In 2024, Usher took the stage in Las Vegas. In 2023, Rihanna took the stage at State Farm Stadium during Super Bowl LVII. Before that, five performers took the stage for Super Bowl LVI in Los Angeles: Eminem, Dr. Dre. Snoop Dogg, Kendrick Lamar and Mary J. Blige performed halfway through the Rams win over the Bengals. \n\n        \n            \n                Super Bowl 2026: Where to watch Seahawks vs. Patriots with TV channel, live stream and kickoff time\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nFor the artists who play the halftime show at the Super Bowl, they're entertaining an audience that is exponentially bigger than any they've ever encountered.

Do you remember that killer halftime show featuring the Rockettes, Chubby Checker and the 88 grand pianos in 1988? Do you remember the captivating \"Be Bop Bamboozled\" at the Orange Bowl in 1989? No, no you do not. Ditto Carol Channing (twice) or any one of those four annoyingly contrived Up With People performances in the late '70s and early '80s.The Super Bowl halftime show, before Michael Jackson, was an endless wasteland of college marching bands and maddening flag-spinning tributes, from salutes to Hollywood (twice), to Motown, to the Big Band Era, to the Caribbean, to Duke Ellington. We also got the New Kids on the Block (1991) not singing any of their biggest hits and Gloria Estefan (1992) providing the soundtrack for Olympic figure skaters Dorothy Hamill and Brian Boitano of \"What would Brian Boitano do?\" fame, because nothing says a Minnesota Super Bowl like the lead singer of the Miami Sound Machine.Then we got the King of Pop at the Rose Bowl in 1993 -- and the Super Bowl halftime show was never the same again.\nHere is the complete list of previous Super Bowl halftime performers and themes:2026: Bad Bunny2025: Kendrick Lamar with special guest SZA2024: Usher with special guests Alicia Keys, Jermaine Dupri, H.E.R., will.i.am, Lil Jon, Ludacris2023: Rihanna2022: Eminem, Dr. Dre.

On Sunday, the AFC champion New England Patriots will do battle with the NFC champion Seattle Seahawks for the right to raise the Lombardi Trophy.New England advanced to the Super Bowl for the first time since the 2018 season thanks to consecutive victories over the Los Angeles Chargers, Houston Texans and Denver Broncos. The Patriots won a sloppy, snowy AFC title game over a Broncos team starting its backup quarterback, emerging with a 10-7 win thanks to several Denver miscues, some well-timed runs from Drake Maye and an electric performance from a defense that has stepped up in a big way during this playoff run.Seattle is headed back to the Super Bowl for the first time since making it in back-to-back years in 2013 and 2014. The Seahawks earned a first-round bye and then defeated the division rival San Francisco 49ers and Los Angeles Rams in consecutive weeks. They won a thrilling, back-and-forth NFC title game on the strength of a fantastic performance from Sam Darnold, who slayed some demons by throwing for 346 yards and three touchdowns in the 31-27 victory.Which of these two teams will emerge victorious and hoist the Lombardi Trophy? We'll find out soon enough. But in the meantime, here's a look at how you can actually watch the game.\nWhere to watch Super Bowl 2026Date: Sunday, Feb. 8 | Time: 6:30 p.m. ETLocation: Levi's Stadium (Santa Clara, California)TV: NBC, streaming on PeacockHalftime performer: Bad BunnyFollow: CBS Sports App\nFind all of our Super Bowl LX coverage at CBSSports.com right here.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks are the main attraction when Super Bowl LX kicks off in two days, but the roster of singers on Super Bowl Sunday are all stars in their own right. In addition to the announcement of Bad Bunny being named the featured halftime performer months ago, we know that Charlie Puth, Brandi Carlile and Coco Jones have been added to the list of singers for the big game on Sunday, February 8.The pregame entertainment will come ahead of the 6:30 p.m. ET kickoff on NBC and Peacock at Levi's Stadium, and the halftime show will be after 30 minutes of play.\"Charlie, Brandi, and Coco are generational talents, and we are honored to have them -- alongside our extraordinary deaf performers -- on Super Bowl LX's world stage,\" said Desiree Perez, CEO of Roc Nation. \"This moment embodies the very best of culture, live performance, and our country, perfectly kicking off game day.\" The Bad Bunny announcement followed months of rumors and predictions, and was made in a subtle way back at the end of September. Headlining the Super Bowl halftime show is one of the top singing gigs of the year, and this was how the 31-year-old singer made the announcement on social media. \nThe Puerto Rican singer is the most-streamed artist in the world. Bad Bunny has 16 Grammy nominations, with six wins. His first three Grammy wins were for Best Latin Pop or Urban Album for YHLQMDLG, Best Musica Urbana Album for El Último Tour Del Mundo and Un Verano Sin Ti. He also took home one of the biggest awards, Album of the Year, at last week's Grammys for DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS. It was the first Spanish-language album to win the award.Some of his other awards include the American Music Award for Favorite Latin Artist, the BET Award for Single of the Year for his hit song \"I Like It\" with Cardi B and J Balvin and Billboard Top Latin.Bad Bunny's top songs are \"Vete,\" \"Titi Me Pregunto,\" \"Que Pasaria\" and \"BAILE INoLIDABLE.\" \nUsually the special guests are announced closer to the championship game. One early guess for a special guest is Cardi B, who is also connected to the NFL because she recently gave birth to a boy, the son of Patriots receiver Stefon Diggs. Rapper Kendrick Lamar, who brought out multiple special guests including SZA and Serena Williams, was last year's headliner. Some other iconic halftime performers include Prince, Beyoncé, Rihanna, Paul McCartney, U2 and Bruce Springsteen, just to name a few. The halftime show become a cultural moment for the masses as it is typically the most-watched performance of the year. Here's a look at who will perform each pregame song on Sunday:\"The Star-Spangled Banner\"Charlie Puth and renowned Deaf music artist Fred Beam will perform the national anthem ahead of the big game. Puth is a multi-award winning and multi-platinum singer, songwriter and producer. His hits include \"See You Again,\" \"Attention\" and \"We Don't Talk Anymore.\" Beam is a actor, dancer, poet, educator, choreographer, director and visual artist.\n\"America the Beautiful\"Brandi Carlile and Deaf music performer Julian Ortiz will perform \"America the Beautiful.\" Carlile has an impressive resume that includes an Oscar nomination, two Emmy wins and a book that reached No. 1 on The New York Times' bestsellers list. \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\"\"Lift Every Voice and Sing\" will be performed by Coco Jones and renowned Deaf music artist Fred Beam. Jones has quickly made a name for herself in R&B music, with eight Grammy nominations. Her hit \"ICU\" is platinum certified. She is an actress as well as a musician.The 60th edition of the Super Bowl will be played on Sunday, Feb. 8, 2026, on NBC. The backdrop of the game and performances will be Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, home of the San Francisco 49ers.\n            ",

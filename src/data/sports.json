    "body": "\n        By the time Arda Guler slid on the pitch at the Santiago Bernabeu in the 63rd minute to cleanly nick the ball off of an opponent's feet, Real Madrid were already in a good mood. Kylian Mbappe's fifth-minute goal was merely the first of several goals they put past Monaco, the hosts up 4-0 when Guler intervened yards from the penalty area. The ball landed at Vinicius Junior's feet, who balanced Guler's grit in that moment for a demonstration of pure skill – he found space as not one, but two Monaco players struggled to keep him at bay and slot a tricky angular finish into the back of the net.It was merely the latest in a game of impressive displays from Vinicius, who had two assists beforehand and was the star of the show as Los Blancos aimed to restore some normalcy after a chaotic few weeks (even if the drama was of the club's own creation). In some ways, the eventual 6-1 drubbing of Monaco did exactly what it needed to in offering a semblance of a reminder that there's room for Vinicius alongside Kylian Mbappe, as well as some of Madrid's other stars.\nVinicius had as many goal contributions against Monaco as he did in his previous 11 matches for Real Madrid, undeniably a strong outing for an important player in a less-than-ideal run of form. The Brazil international was the standout but it was an outing defined by sharing the spotlight – he assisted Mbappe's second with a simple but effective pass, and later was diligent enough to stay with the ball before setting up Franco Mastantuono for a close-range finish.\nHe mixed in a very public hug with new Real Madrid manager Alvaro Arbeloa, which may prove to be more memorable than the strong performance because of the narrative-driven cloud that always looms over the club (again, likely by their own creation). The disagreements between Vincius and ex-coach Xabi Alonso, whose ouster last week remains a topic of conversation, remains still top of mind because of his public display of professional affection for Arbeloa – but does not answer the question of where Los Blancos go from here.\nVinicius, Mbappe, Mastantuono and Guler successfully co-existed on Tuesday, again in a set-up where Mbappe was in a central role – much as Alonso preferred. Arbeloa has rotated through his options a bit in attack, giving Gonzalo Garcia the start over Mastantuono in Saturday's 2-0 win over Levante but Guler and Mastantuono each had a notable cameo in the second half. There is a caveat to be made that three games is not much to judge a coach on, but he seems intent on finding a way to make Vinicius and Mbappe work together.How exactly Arbeloa puts his spin on things is still a little bit unknown, though, just as is the ultimate question of how successful it will be. Finding the balance between all of Los Blancos' stars was Alonso's big task and even if the club's higher-ups did not care for his solution, the question still needs to be answered by someone. Arbeloa's star-focused strategy against Monaco may not be all that impressive, though, considering the fact that the Ligue 1 side are midtable as things stand and may not make it through to the Champions League knockouts depending on the final results of the league phase.Truthfully, stiffer tests await Arbeloa's Real Madrid. While there will be plenty of intrigue around their final league phase match at Benfica next week, where Arbeloa will face his former Madrid manager Jose Mourinho as the Portuguese side fight to advance to the next round, there is a fascinating matchup before that in Villarreal, who sit third place in LaLiga ahead of Saturday's clash. There is no shame in Madrid taking all the victories they can but it will take more than Tuesday's demolition of Monaco to erode skepticism that a lineup with Vinicius and Mbappe will be balanced enough to not only work on any given day, but can help them overtake Barcelona in league play and challenge for the Champions League.\nEven as Vinicius provides Arbeloa – and Real Madrid's leaders, by default – with a vote of confidence, there is still much they need to do to justify Alonso's surprise firing, too.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Several days passed between the time John Harbaugh reportedly accepted the New York Giants job and when the team officially announced his hiring. According to multiple reports, that delay was due to Harbaugh's push for changes to the team's reporting structure, which he downplayed at his introductory press conference on Tuesday.In an interview with The Athletic after his hiring, Harbaugh noted that he will report directly to ownership and not general manager Joe Schoen. That swerve around Schoen is a divergence from how the Giants have done things recently, but Harbaugh insisted the change was \"not really that important.\"Harbaugh said he was simply more comfortable with that reporting structure while noting that he and Schoen will have to work in tandem no matter what.\"I think it's kind of overblown a little bit in terms of how it works. The main thing is that it works and that we work together,\" Harbaugh said. \"That's what matters. That's kind of what I was used to. It felt like a good way to start off. Mr. Mara was happy about that. It seemed like it made sense, but I don't think it really matters. We're all gonna work together, and I promise we all report to the boss, and the boss is ownership.\"\nThroughout his time at the podium, Harbaugh made sure to praise Schoen on numerous occasions, stating that he was \"very impressed\" with the general manager's football knowledge.\"The conversations themselves are what led me to believe there would be great collaboration,\" Harbaugh said. \"I get to know Joe, and we start talking ball, and you see he's a football man. This guy lives and breathes football. His knowledge is deep. He knows the coaches in the league. He knows the players in the league. He probably knows all the scouts in the league, too. He was impressive to me. It was a joy to talk football and really dig into some of the plans of what we could build going forward.\"Once Harbaugh wrapped up at the podium, senior vice president of player personnel Chris Mara also spoke about the new reporting structure and rejected the notion that Harbaugh will have \"final say\" on all roster decisions. Instead, Mara described Harbaugh as \"the most important cog in the wheel.\"\n\"I know that's a big deal around here -- final say,\" Mara said. \"He doesn't have final say, It's collaborative. He'll be the first to admit that. If he had final say with everything in that building, he wouldn't be able to do his job.\"\nMara did concede that Harbaugh may have been the only candidate who carried enough sway for the Giants to change the way they've done business.\"Life has plenty of changes,\" Mara said. \"We've tried it both ways, and we're just comfortable doing this with him. I think with anybody else, maybe it might not have happened that way. Everyone was in agreement, so we're good.\"\nSchoen himself addressed the change, reiterating that he's \"not worried\" about Harbaugh reporting directly to ownership. As someone who's been working in front offices for more than two decades, Schoen said the coach and general manager have always collaborated, regardless of the structure.\"Everywhere I've been -- I've been in the league for 26 years -- the head coach and general manager work together,\" Schoen said, via NFL Media. \"That's the only way it's going to work. Get on the same page and go through the process. Again, we've done it everywhere I've been. I'm not worried about it. That's just something on a piece of paper. Doesn't matter. We need to work together, and we're gonna come to a final conclusion. It's always gonna be about what's best for the New York Giants. I have no problem with that. I'm looking forward to working with him.\"Despite all the chatter about the new reporting structure in the days leading up to Harbaugh's signing, it seems like everyone involved is more than happy to downplay it now. Then again, perhaps change should be a welcome sight for the Giants and their fans.\nSince 2012, the Giants have gone 83-145-1. In that time, they've gone through five full-time coaches while winning just one playoff game. It's past time for New York to try something different, and it will do that with Harbaugh at the helm.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        LSU coach Lane Kiffin previously credited Nick Saban with helping him make the decision to leave Ole Miss and take the LSU job in November, but has now shared details of the conversation he had with the former Alabama coach that led to his choice to head to Baton Rouge.Saban won a national title at LSU before an ill-fated NFL tenure with the Miami Dolphins prior to his legendary career with the Crimson Tide. Saban won six national championships and nine SEC titles over 17 seasons at Alabama from 2007-23.Kiffin served as Saban's offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach from 2014-16, which included a national championship. Alabama fired Kiffin before the 2017 College Football Playoff National Championship Game after he had accepted the Florida Atlantic job and was splitting time for each.\"When [LSU] came in and met with me, it was just different,\" Kiffin said Tuesday. \"The feeling was different and as I sat there and told the story at the press conference, I was torn. When I called Coach Saban and talked it through with him, he said, 'you know, Lane, you'll always regret if you don't go to LSU. It's the best job in America.' And when he said that, it really made the decision for me.\n\"As I've looked at it, it has pushed me. It has got me out of a comfort zone that we were doing amazing things but you come here and feel the power of the place and it drives you every day to even go to another level.\"\nSaban said on College GameDay after Kiffin's departure to LSU that his former play-caller was initially \"confused\" on what he wanted to do.\"I never tell anybody what they should do,\" Saban said on ESPN. \"I just try to bring some thought into it so that they can make good decisions for themselves and their family and their future.\"\nKiffin left the Rebels before the start of the playoff and was not allowed to coach Ole Miss in the postseason after a ruling by athletic director Keith Carter. The Rebels, with new coach Pete Golding (Kiffin's defensive coordinator in Oxford) leading the way, blew out No. 11 Tulane in the first round and upset No. 3 Georgia in the quarterfinals before falling to No. 10 Miami in the CFP semifinals.Kiffin went 55-19 over six seasons at Ole Miss. One of the highest-profile coaches in college football since joining the Rebels in 2020, Kiffin led the program to four 10-win seasons and three finishes of No. 11 or better in the AP Top 25. LSU, meanwhile, fired Brian Kelly after the eighth game of his fourth season on the job, opening the door for its pursuit of Kiffin. Florida also came after Kiffin, but LSU was the more attractive destination. And Saban's advice clearly held weight. \n\"You know, coach Saban kind of coached at another place in this conference, so I can't ... I can't really say exactly what he said, but I'll say I think the world of coach Saban, and I respect him,\" Kiffin said at his introductory press conference in December. \"And so, there's a reason I'm here.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        When Jimmy Butler crumbled to the floor on Monday night and started dropping F bombs as he held his right knee, which was confirmed as a torn ACL on Tuesday, the Warriors' season, which was at least starting to trend upward, ended. You have to wonder if the same can be said for Golden State's Stephen Curry era. I know, on some level, it's too early to start talking about finality for a guy who is still very clearly nowhere near his end as a superstar player. But we're all thinking it. If the window for a fifth championship was still even slightly cracked, if only in theory, it has almost certainly shut short of two unlikely scenarios playing out. The first one would be trading Butler, which is unlikely but at least worth considering. Nobody is going to want a 36-year-old historically malcontent player who is on the books for almost $60 million next season but won't even be able to play for the next 10-12 months, unless that team has its own crappy contract to get rid of. Our Sam Quinn outlined some possible trades that would fit this construct, with Anthony Davis and Joel Embiid at the top of the list. Personally, I think the Sixers are starting to like their shot with Embiid in the East this season -- even if it would probably be smart to get off that contract before the next inevitable injury arrives. \nBut let's say the Sixers would be up for it. Would the Warriors? Almost certainly not. Embiid is due $59.5 million next season, $64.3 million the season after that, and $69 million in 2028-29 when he'll be 34 and basically certain to be completely broken down. He's barely holding it together at 31. Even making it the remainder of this season healthy is a long shot. And that's before we even consider the fit of a lumbering big man in a Steph Curry offense. Davis is easier to envision. He's also a long shot to stay healthy through a playoff run (hell, he's not even healthy right now), but he's expected to be back this season and he comes off the books one year before Embiid.At any rate, a healthy, or at least playable Davis is interesting enough to pacify the puncher's chance fans even if there's almost no way he would actually stay healthy -- to say nothing of the issues he would pose as a clunky shooter next to Draymond Green. \nWho knows if the Mavericks and Warriors will even discuss this deal, let alone actually do it. Either way, to convince yourself that all these pieces are just going to magically fall into perfect place, stay healthy, and deliver another championship run to a currently eighth-seeded team in a murderous Western Conference is a big reach. My dad would call it a pipe dream, and the older I get the more I realize that man is rarely wrong. There is one trade I can see keeping this window open with Curry in Golden State: Lauri Markkanen. This would cost the Warriors everything they have to give to the Jazz, but I bet it's at least being talked about. Unfortunate for fans still clinging to the hope of a salvaged season, Danny Ainge shows up to these meetings in a ski mask and the Warriors are too prideful to get robbed. And so, if a Butler trade -- be it for Embiid or Davis or, hell, a Kings package centered on Zach LaVine or Domantas Sabonis -- isn't going to give Curry a chance to win a fifth title with the Warriors, then his only chance at doing so would be with another team. \nNow, I have a lot of thoughts on the trading-a-franchise-icon front. First and foremost, you don't consider doing it for a second unless the player has demanded out or the return is going to set up your next decade when your current window has closed. This is why Nico Harrison was an moron. The Luka trade didn't check either of those boxes. And Curry means incalculably more to the Warriors than Luka did to Dallas. Trading him would shake the Bay Area and greater basketball world to its core. Having said that, I grew up in Northern California, have been a Warriors fan all my life and hold Stephen Curry, athletically speaking, in an almost religious regard. I wouldn't have a problem with him finishing his career elsewhere. I'm a grown man with a family and bills. Sports entertain me. Curry gunning for No. 5 on the Rockets would entertain me greatly. Tampa Tom Brady was awesome. If Curry were to ever open that conversation, we can reopen the one about him possibly winning a fifth ring.\nBut we all know this would never happen unless Curry asked for it, and since Curry probably isn't going to ask for it, well, it's not going to happen. Every indication he's ever given is that he places more value on finishing with the Warriors than possibly finishing with a fifth ring. That could change, of course. Curry is as competitive as they come. He's still an elite player. The Warriors could still get a major return, much like Boston when it traded Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett, that could set up the next era. Maybe a conversation will happen at some point. But until then, the best the Warriors can do it try to remain competitive in Curry's closing chapter (nobody wants to see the final Kobe years with the Lakers). They may even still make a Jonathan Kuminga margin move at the deadline, But here's the reality: The moment Butler hit the ground on Monday night a lot more than just this season ended. It feels likely that Stephen Curry is done chasing championships with the Warriors.\n            ",

Diggs made three tackles in two games with the Packers, including seeing brief action in the 31-27 loss to the Chicago Bears in the NFC wild card round. \nDiggs, 27, enjoyed a fast start to his career that included leading the NFL with 11 interceptions in 2021, his second season.

Both are out for the remainder of the postseason, which is unfortunate for them and their teams.  For Nix, he will miss the AFC Championship Game against New England, but he should return for the start of the 2026 campaign. We'll see what happens with his recovery and what Denver does this offseason in free agency and the NFL Draft, but Nix should be considered a No. 2 Fantasy quarterback at best in the majority of leagues.  He had a solid game against Buffalo before getting injured with 279 passing yards, three touchdowns, and one interception, along with 29 rushing yards, and he scored at least 21.5 Fantasy points for the eighth time this season. For the season, Nix averaged 20.3 Fantasy points per game.  Charbonnet's injury is the bigger Fantasy storyline for the postseason and into 2026. He will likely miss the start of next season due to his ACL tear, and ESPN reported that Charbonnet is facing \"a long road to come back.\"  Seattle will lean on Kenneth Walker III in the NFC Championship Game against the Rams, and he had a dominant game against the 49ers in the Divisional Round when Charbonnet was injured, with 19 carries for 116 yards and three touchdowns and three catches for 29 yards on three targets. Charbonnet missed one game during the season in Week 3 against New Orleans with a foot injury, and Walker had 16 carries for 38 yards and two touchdowns and one catch for 12 yards on one target.  Walker also did well against the Rams in two games this season in tandem with Charbonnet. In Week 11 at Los Angeles, Walker had 16 carries for 67 yards and a touchdown and three catches for 44 yards on three targets for 20.1 PPR points. And in Week 16 against the Rams, Walker had 11 carries for 100 yards and a touchdown and three catches for 64 yards on three targets for 25.4 PPR points.  Seattle will now have a decision to make with Walker, who is a free agent this offseason. With Charbonnet injured, Walker returning to the Seahawks on a new deal or the franchise tag makes a lot of sense.  We'll see what develops this offseason, but Walker's Fantasy stock is now on the rise, especially if he returns to Seattle while Charbonnet is out. We could be looking at Walker as a second-round pick in the majority of Fantasy leagues.  Charbonnet will be a late-round pick at best, but hopefully, he can make a speedy recovery. For now, Charbonnet's Fantasy stock is clearly on the decline. Now, let's review some other players who saw their Fantasy stock rise or fall after what just happened in the Divisional Round. Stock UpDrake MayeMaye had a solid outing against Houston in the Divisional Round with 179 passing yards, three touchdowns, and one interception, and he added 10 rushing yards. He scored 20.2 Fantasy points, and he's now reached that total in five of his past seven games. For the season, Maye averaged 24.4 Fantasy points per game, and he continues to solidify himself as a top three Fantasy quarterback heading into 2026. The only quarterbacks I would consider drafting ahead of Maye, as of now, are Josh Allen and Joe Burrow.  Caleb Williams Williams ended his season with an interception in overtime of the 20-17 loss to the Rams, but he gave Chicago a chance to win the game with a ridiculous touchdown pass in the fourth quarter to Cole Kmet. He finished with 20.3 Fantasy points, and he reached that total in each of his final six games. There's a lot to love about Williams, who will hopefully continue to improve in his second season with Ben Johnson, and the Bears are loaded on offense with Colston Loveland, Luther Burden III, and D.J. Moore. I plan to draft Williams as a borderline top-five Fantasy quarterback in all leagues.  Dalton Kincaid The Bills had a tough 33-30 loss to the Broncos in overtime, but Kincaid ended his season on a high note with six catches for 83 yards and a touchdown on six targets for 20.3 PPR points. In two playoff games against Jacksonville and Denver, Kincaid had nine catches for 111 yards and two touchdowns on 11 targets. He should be considered a borderline top-10 Fantasy tight end in all leagues for 2026, but we'll see what Buffalo does this offseason to enhance the receiving corps, especially with a new coach and offensive coordinator. Kincaid played in 14 games this season, including the playoffs, and he scored at least 11.8 PPR points in seven of them. He'll be a great late-round pick in all formats.  Jayden Higgins Nico Collins (concussion) didn't play in the 28-16 loss to New England, which allowed Higgins to play a more prominent role with six catches for 59 yards on 10 targets. It wasn't a great game, but I'm hopeful Higgins will open the 2026 campaign as the No. 2 receiver for the Texans opposite Collins. We'll see what happens with Tank Dell (knee), who missed all of 2025, and Christian Kirk is a free agent this offseason. Jaylin Noel will also have an expanded role as well, but Higgins is worth drafting in all leagues with a late-round pick. He had eight games in his rookie season with at least five targets, and he averaged 11.5 PPR points over that span, including four touchdowns.  Kayshon Boutte Boutte had three catches for 75 yards and a touchdown on five targets in the victory against Houston, and he's someone to target in all leagues with a late-round pick in 2026. We'll see what New England does with its receiving corps this offseason, especially with Stefon Diggs, but Boutte should still have a prominent role for the Patriots. He had five games this season with at least five targets, including the playoffs, and he scored at least 13.5 PPR points in all of those outings. He could emerge as a No. 3 Fantasy receiver in all leagues if he gets more chances in 2026. Stock DownChristian McCaffreyMcCaffrey fought through a stinger in the 41-6 loss at Seattle, and he struggled with 11 carries for 35 yards and five catches for 39 yards on six targets. His production against the Seahawks isn't the real concern, especially since he played hurt, but we now have to determine his Fantasy value for 2026. He turns 30 in June, and he has had over 400 total touches for the second time in three seasons. For now, we'll plan to draft McCaffrey in the first round in the majority of leagues, but he could be tough to trust at his age and coming off a heavy workload in 2025.  Luther Burden III I'm excited to draft Burden in 2026, and he could be special in his sophomore campaign. But he struggled in his past two games against Green Bay and the Rams when Rome Odunze was healthy, with a combined six catches for 66 yards on 14 targets. Burden also had three catches for 35 yards on four targets in Week 18 against Detroit. We'll see what the Bears do this offseason with D.J. Moore, but if he returns as expected, then it could be too many mouths to feed in Chicago for Burden to reach his full potential when you include Odunze and Colston Loveland. Burden remains my favorite Bears receiver in 2026, but the earliest I would draft him is Round 5 in most leagues.  Courtland Sutton We'll see how Sutton does in the AFC Championship Game against New England, but it's hard to expect a big outing with Bo Nix (ankle) out and Jarrett Stidham under center, especially with a matchup looming against Christian Gonzalez. Sutton struggled against Buffalo with four catches for 53 yards on nine targets, and he has scored 9.3 PPR points or less in three games in a row. For the season, Sutton averaged 13.5 PPR points per game, and he's been solid in two years with Nix, with an average of 77.5 catches, 1,049 yards, and 7.5 touchdowns over that span. He's a good No. 2 Fantasy receiver in the majority of leagues, but the earliest you should draft him is Round 4.  C.J. Stroud Stroud was bad in the loss to New England with 212 passing yards, one touchdown, and four interceptions, and he added 11 rushing yards for 7.6 Fantasy points. He ended the season with five games in a row with 19.3 Fantasy points or less, and he only had one game with more than 20 Fantasy points since Week 8. The hope for Stroud in 2026 would be Tank Dell (knee) back at 100 percent and a loaded receiving corps featuring Nico Collins, Jayden Higgins, Jaylin Noel, Dell, and Dalton Schultz. But Stroud has yet to recapture his rookie season magic from 2023 when he averaged 21.5 Fantasy points, and he's been at 17.6 points or less in each of the past two years. Stroud should only be considered a backup Fantasy quarterback in most leagues for next season.  Woody Marks Marks was bad against New England with 14 carries for 17 yards and two catches for 19 yards on three targets. It was a huge step back from his performance in the Wild-Card Round against Pittsburgh, when he had 19 carries for 112 yards and a touchdown and no catches on one target. But Marks struggled down the stretch with 8.5 PPR points or less in seven of his final nine games, including the playoffs. He had at least 16 total touches in seven of those outings, but five of them were bad stat lines. We'll see what Houston does with its backfield in 2026, and it appears that Joe Mixon (foot) won't be back after he missed all of 2025. Marks could be the No. 1 running back for the Texans, but the earliest I would draft him is Round 6.Championship Round Playoff RankingsQuarterback1. Matthew Stafford 2. Drake Maye 3. Sam Darnold 4.

    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL Playoffs move into Championship weekend with the Denver Broncos, New England Patriots, Seattle Seahawks and Los Angeles Rams vying for a spot in Super Bowl LX. SportsLine NFL expert Jeff Hochman has lined up a three-leg parlay that spans both games and has included a player prop in his picks. Here's a look at what he's cooked up.NFL Conference Championships three-leg parlay strategyWe've finally made it to the NFC and AFC Championship games—the showdowns that will decide who gets a shot at the Super Bowl. With just three games left, it feels like the entire season comes down to this weekend. Honestly, I'm still buzzing from last week's 3-0 parlay sweep (and if you were on the Sportsline Discord, you know we cashed in with the Bears plus the points, too). Momentum is definitely on our side, and I'm fired up to break down these matchups.For the AFC Championship, I see some real opportunities. The matchups and recent performances create some angles that I'm excited about. The NFC game looks a bit tougher to nail down, and it could go either way. Still, I love the challenge, and I'm ready to keep this hot streak rolling as we head into the biggest games of the year. Be sure to grab the alternate lines I've listed.NFL Championship Games parlayDenver Broncos +6.5 (alternate line) vs. New England Patriots\nJarrett Stidham's career comes full circle as he faces the Patriots for the first time since being drafted by New England in 2019. Sean Payton's track record with backup quarterbacks is no accident. In 2019, when Drew Brees went down, Payton led the Saints to a flawless 5-0 run with Teddy Bridgewater at the helm—just one of many times he's lived up to that \"QB whisperer\" reputation. Around the league, Payton's ability to get the best out of his quarterbacks is no secret. That's exactly why I'm siding with Denver in this one.Let's be real—Stidham's career numbers (78.3 passer rating, 59.4% completion rate) tell you he's a steady backup, not a superstar. Stidham's 2025 preseason was eye-opening. He was nearly flawless, completing 30 of 38 passes for 376 yards, four touchdowns, and posting a ridiculous 143.0 passer rating. Preseason numbers can be misleading but in Payton's system, it's a sign Stidham is comfortable with the playbook and can find his rhythm right away. With Bo Nix out, New England has no clue what to expect from Denver's offense. That surprise factor could really matter.On the opposing sideline, Patriots second-year quarterback Drake Maye presents a drastically different volatility profile. Maye threw three touchdowns in the Divisional Round victory over the Texans, including a clutch 32-yard strike to Kayshon Boutte. However, he also committed three turnovers, including two interceptions and a lost fumble. He has never played in Denver and the altitude is real. Historically, Denver has maintained a .700 home winning percentage over a 30-year sample, a distinction that reflects far more than a typical homefield advantage.  Maye is about to face a Broncos defense that thrives on making life miserable for inexperienced quarterbacks. Denver led the league with 68 sacks in the regular season and consistently smothered opponents at home, ranking fifth in fewest yards allowed per play. Conversely, New England's defense has struggled away from Foxborough against inferior offenses, ranking just 24th in yards per play allowed on the road. Also, the Broncos own a +45 sack differential (ranked first) while the Patriots are ranked 24th (-13). The pressure, deafening crowd, and thin mountain air in Denver create a gauntlet that can rattle even the most composed quarterbacks.Per R.J. White: Coming into this postseason, home underdogs of four points or more hadn't lost against the spread in the last 50 years—9-0, with six outright wins and three close covers between 1976 and 2020. That trend hasn't missed a beat this year: home dogs in that spot are now a perfect 3-0 ATS this postseason.Los Angeles Rams +3.5 (alternate line) vs. Seattle Seahawks\nMy betting model sets this game at Seattle -4 with a total of 47 points. So why am I fading my own numbers? It all comes down to the quarterback position. I'm willing to take the risk to see if Sam Darnold can step up in the biggest game of his career. On the other side, I've already seen Matthew Stafford deliver in this exact situation before. Experience makes a difference, and that's what tips the scales for me here. I love the alternate spread up to the key number of +3.5 because the Rams have covered in eight of their last ten matchups against Seattle—including a spotless 5-0 record as underdogs. That track record makes the alternate line even more appealing in a matchup likely to be decided by which team stays healthier and protects the football.Seattle enters this game with a 14-3 record, a metric that historically commands respect. However, NFL records are often lagging indicators of future performance, particularly when driven by unsustainable variance in one-score games. The Seahawks' Week 16 victory over the Rams, which secured them the NFC West title and the No. 1 seed, required a 16-point fourth-quarter comeback and a miraculous \"Zachwards Pass\" two-point conversion. With Zach Charbonnet sidelined with an ACL tear, the burden falls even more heavily on Kenneth Walker, making Seattle's running back depth a true concern.By contrast, the Rams' 12-5 record masks a team that has actually performed at a higher per-play efficiency. In that same Week 16 loss, the Rams outgained Seattle 581 yards to 415. In predictive analytics, yardage differential and yards per play tell us much more about a team's strength than simply looking at the win-loss record. Bookmakers are giving Seattle credit for the outcome in Week 16, but savvy bettors are focusing on how the Rams actually outgained them by a wide margin.The belief that Lumen Field is an impregnable fortress for visiting teams, particularly the Rams, doesn't hold up to scrutiny. Los Angeles has covered the spread in six straight games in Seattle. Sean McVay always has his team on the same page and Stafford never seems rattled—even when he's calling plays in the middle of all that Seattle noise. Still, sportsbooks keep giving Seattle a bump for homefield advantage—even though the Rams have proved the crowd noise isn't an issue for them. I'm backing the Rams in this spot, and I feel great about grabbing the extra cushion at +3.5.Hunter Henry Over 42.5 receiving yards\nWith Stefon Diggs expected to be blanketed by Patrick Surtain, Maye's most reliable option could be Hunter Henry. The Broncos' pass defense is tough overall but they've had trouble containing tight ends, especially in the middle of the field, allowing the ninth-most yards per game (59.7) to the position. It's common for young quarterbacks to lean on their tight ends in loud, hostile stadiums, and Henry fits that \"safety valve\" role perfectly. He's been a steady presence for New England, ranking seventh among tight ends in target share (18.05%) and surpassing this yardage mark in 11 of 18 games this season. Expect Maye to look Henry's way early and often.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Carlos Beltrán and Andruw Jones have been elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame, the BBWAA announced Tuesday night. The slugging center fields join Jeff Kent (elected by the Contemporary Baseball Era Committee last mont) in the 2026 class. As we sift through the vote percentages and look for the biggest takeaways, some winners and losers emerge beyond the obvious winner in Beltrán and Jones. Let's walk through a few.Winner: Jose AltuveWait, what? Altuve is still active. How can he be a winner here? It's indirect. There are times we see a domino effect in voting. There was always a Coors Field stigma attached to Rockies players, but once Larry Walker got in the Hall, it was mostly smooth sailing for Todd Helton. This is a different situation, obviously, but the 2017 Astros have the electronic sign-stealing scandal attached to them. In my opinion, it's why it took Beltrán four tries to get in rather than two or even just one. Now that \"El Jefe\" from that 2017 championship team is in, does it clear a less rocky path for Altuve? It feels likely. He's at 2,388 career hits with a .303 average with three batting titles, appealing to old-school voters along with WAR and JAWS numbers that likely please new-school voters. I'll allow for the possibility that Altuve's case is treated differently than Beltrán's, but this has to serve as good news overall for the 2017 MVP.\nWinner: Chase UtleyA second baseman with good prospects to make the Hall of Fame is Utley. I've discussed him as a worthy peak Hall of Fame candidate for the past three years and he's really making good headway. After getting 28.8% of the vote in his first year and 39.8% last year, he's now gotten 59.1% this time around, his third year on the ballot. If needed, there are seven more tries and his vote percentage will surely only continue to rise, especially given the relatively weak ballot we have on tap next year.\n        \n            \n                Who will be on 2027 Baseball Hall of Fame ballot? Buster Posey headlines newcomers\n                \n                    Matt Snyder                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLoser: Manny RamírezManny is now done on the ballot after failing to reach 75% on his 10th and final year. Ramírez got just 38.8% of the vote. We've seen Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens shut out twice by the Era Committee, too, and Ramírez was suspended twice for PEDs (neither Bonds nor Clemens were ever suspended). Simply, unless something extreme happens in the coming years or even decades, Ramírez will never make the Hall of Fame.Loser: Alex RodríguezIn his fifth year, A-Rod made progress again -- it's just not enough to believe he's eventually going to get all the way to the 75% of the vote he needs to make the Hall of Fame. He's now gone, respectively, from 34.3% to 35.7% to 34.8% to 37.1% to 40.0%. He no longer needs to more than double his vote tally, but it's pretty close to that. It's hard to see that happening.  \nLoser: Robinson CanóCanó, opposite of Altuve, is an indirect loser. His stats show a résumé that is worthy of induction into the Hall of Fame. He's a career .301/.351/.488 (124 OPS+) hitter with 68.7 WAR and some of the best power stats we've ever seen from a second baseman. At that position, he's second in home runs, fifth in RBI, sixth in slugging percentage and 10th in WAR. He was also nailed with an 80-game suspension for a failed PED test in 2018. Given the fate of Ramírez and how things are going for A-Rod, we can probably put the proverbial nail in the coffin of Canó's Hall of Fame case before he even gets on the ballot.Winners: Félix Hernández and a generation of starting pitchersSomething I've been harping on for a decade (I'm not kidding) is that only the absolute, top-shelf aces from the last few generations of starting pitchers are getting in. That remains the case. Of the top 50 starting pitchers in WAR in the Wild Card Era (1995-present), only Randy Johnson, Pedro Martínez, Roy Halladay, Mike Mussina, Greg Maddux, CC Sabathia, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz are in the Hall of Fame. Past generations have more than 20 starters who made it. I've already mapped this out (most recently in making Cole Hamels' case). Sure, Justin Verlander, Max Scherzer, Clayton Kershaw and probably (hopefully? surely?) Zack Greinke are headed to Cooperstown once eligible, but there's still a shortfall compared to past generations.\nPerhaps we're making progress. King Felix got 46.1% of the vote in his second try, an 25.5-point rise from his first year. Hamels debuted at a nice 23.8%. Even Andy Pettitte with his PED baggage and Mark Buehrle (a traditionally unappealing case for many voters and fans alike) showed up nicely this time around -- 48.5% and 20%, respectively. Pettitte has work to do, but he has a chance to make it in his final years on the ballot.Maybe this bodes well for the cases of Jon Lester (coming on the ballot next year), David Price (2028), Stephen Strasburg (2028), Adam Wainwright (2029), Corey Kluber (2029) and others.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Patience appears to no longer be a virtue, especially when it comes to NFL coaches. That was recently made clear with the Buffalo Bills' decision to fire Sean McDermott after nine largely successful seasons. McDermott, however, is only the latest successful coach who was recently handed his walking papers. John Harbaugh (who has since resurfaced with the New York Giants) was also fired despite an 18-year run with the Ravens that included a Super Bowl title, 12 playoff appearances and eight road wins in the playoffs, an NFL record for a coach. Mike McDaniel and Kevin Stefanski (who has since become the Atlanta Falcons' new coach) were also fired this month despite enjoying various levels of success with their respective former clubs. Raheem Morris was fired in Atlanta after just two years on the job. Prior to getting a contract extension, Packers coach Matt LaFleur was also rumored to be on the hot seat, a prospect that his former quarterback, Aaron Rodgers, deemed as laughable. \n\"When I first got in the league, there wouldn't be conversation about whether those guys were on the hot seat,\" Rodgers said while alluding to LaFleur and Mike Tomlin, who stepped away last week after 19 seasons as the Steelers' coach. \"But the way that the league is covered now and the way that there's snap decisions and the validity given to the Twitter experts and all the experts on TV now who make it seem like they know what the hell they're talking about, to me that's an absolute joke.\"The reality is that NFL coaches are no longer given the time they used to get in terms of having success. With that in mind, we decided to look back at the careers of 10 legendary coaches who -- if they coached today -- may not have been given the time necessary to build the careers that ultimately ended up in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Weeb Ewbank Ewbank (pictured here with Joe Namath) overcame slow coaching starts to win two of the most iconic games in pro football history.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Ewbank is the shining example of what can happen when patience is exercised. Twice, Ewbank endured slow starts before guiding franchises to championships. The first time occurred with the Colts, who endured three consecutive losing seasons under his watch before capturing back-to-back NFL titles in 1958-59. The first title, a 23-17 win over the Giants, was the first NFL game that went to overtime and is still largely considered as the greatest game in league history. \nAfter nine years in Baltimore, Ewbank took over as the Jets' coach in 1963. New York posted losing records in each of Ewbank's first four seasons before going 8-5-1 in his fifth season. A year later, Ewbank led New York to the biggest upset in NFL history, as the 18-point underdog Jets posted a 16-7 win over Ewbank's former team -- the Colts -- in Super Bowl III. Tom Landry Landry's decision to move forward with Staubach as his QB1 changed his and the Cowboys' fortunes.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            The Cowboys' early struggles under Landry is an example of how much things have changed. Landry took over an expansion team that didn't win a game in its first season. The Cowboys then posted records of 4-9-1, 5-8-1, 4-10 and 5-8-1 before having their first non-losing season in 1965. Landry and the Cowboys didn't have a winning season until 1966, his sixth year on the job. But even after they started to win, Landry started to earn the reputation as a great coach who couldn't win the big one. That narrative was the byproduct of losses to the Packers in consecutive NFL Championship games and an excruciating loss to the Colts in Super Bowl V. \nThe Cowboys finally broke through in Landry's 12th year on the job, defeating the Dolphins in Super Bowl VI to secure the franchise's first title. Landry's midseason decision to put Roger Staubach in the starting lineup over Craig Morton was a critical decision that paid immediate dividends. Landry went on to enjoy a 29-year run with the Cowboys that included another Super Bowl win and a record 21 straight non-losing season. He was fired by Jerry Jones shortly after Jones purchased the franchise in 1989. Chuck NollA decade after going 1-13, Noll became the first coach to win four Super Bowls.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Noll won his first game in Pittsburgh, but he didn't win again that year as the 1969 Steelers went 1-13. Noll and the Steelers endured two more losing seasons before Pittsburgh finally broke through in 1972, winning the franchise's first division title and playoff game by virtue of Franco Harris' \"Immaculate Reception.\" \nUnder Noll, the Steelers dominated the 1970s, winning four Super Bowls over a six-year span. Pittsburgh is still the only team to win back-to-back Super Bowls twice. The Steelers' 1979 team is the only Super Bowl champion that was comprised solely of homegrown talent. Noll remained the Steelers' coach through the 1991, and while his teams didn't match their earlier level of success during the later years of his tenure, Noll was able to leave on his own terms while putting the next coach (Bill Cowher) in a position to succeed by handing him a roster comprised of young talent. John MaddenAfter seven years of heartbreak, Madden and his players finally reached the mountaintop in Super Bowl XI.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Madden was the modern-day McDermott during his first seven years with the Raiders. In fact, Madden and McDermott own two of the three highest winning percentages by a coach over a six-year span without a trip to the Super Bowl. \nDuring his first seven seasons, Madden's Raiders lost five AFC Championship games. While the losses were difficult, Madden remained confident in his conviction that he and the Raiders would one day be champions. That day finally arrived on Jan. 9, 1977, when Madden was carried off the field by his players after the Raiders recorded a 32-14 win over the Minnesota Vikings in Super Bowl XI. The win capped off a dominant, 16-1 season for the Raiders and Madden, a 2006 Hall of Fame inductee whose .759 regular-season winning percentage is the highest in NFL history for coaches who coached in at least 100 games. Bill WalshSix years after getting passed over in Cincinnati, Walsh defeated his former employer in the Super Bowl.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Walsh didn't get his first NFL head coaching job until he was 48 after getting passed over in Cincinnati following Paul Brown's retirement from coaching. Initially, it appeared that Brown had made the right call as Walsh's 49ers were just 2-14 in 1979 and 6-10 in 1980. \nEverything changed in 1981, though. Led by the emergence of third-year quarterback Joe Montana and a defense that featured three standout rookie defensive backs (including future Hall of Famer Ronnie Lott), the 49ers went 13-3 en route to capturing the franchise's first Super Bowl title. In a twist of irony, the 49ers' first Super Bowl win came against Brown's Bengals. Despite winning another Super Bowl in 1984, Walsh was on the \"hot seat\" after the 49ers were stunned by the underdog Vikings in the 1987 playoffs. Cooler heads prevailed, however, and Walsh remained on the sideline for the 1988 season. The 49ers won their Super Bowl that year (defeating the Bengals, again), and Walsh retired shortly afterward. Bill Parcells Parcells has often credited George Martin and other key members of the 1984 Giants for saving his career.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            It was noisy in the Big Apple after the Giants went just 3-12-1 in Parcells' first year on the sideline. While he was retained for the 1984 season, Parcells knew that the Giants had to win that year if he was going to stick around. \nThe Giants did just that, going 9-7 in the regular season before staging an upset win over Eric Dickerson's Rams in the NFC wild card round. Parcells has often credited the '84 team for essentially saving his career. Two years later, many members of that Giants team contributed to New York's first Super Bowl-winning team. Parcells was carried off the field that day and again four years later after the Giants upset the Bills in the only Super Bowl decided by a single point. Parcells later enjoyed successful tenures with the Patriots, Jets and Cowboys and was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2013. None that success probably wouldn't have happened if the Giants canned him after the '83 season. \nJimmy Johnson Johnson and Jones eventually broke up, but not before winning back-to-back Super Bowls together.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Johnson and the Cowboys had an ugly divorce in 1994, but that was after he had guided the franchise to back-to-back Super Bowl wins. In a different scenario, it's certainly possible that Johnson wouldn't have been given the chance to lead the Cowboys to that success after he went 1-15 during his first season as coach. Jerry Jones, who was just starting his tenure as the team's owner, was determined to have success with Johnson, the man he handpicked to replace the legendary Landry. Jones' loyalty was quickly rewarded by Johnson, who headed the quickest turnaround in NFL history after the Cowboys won Super Bowl XXVII just three years after winning one game. Johnson left after the 1993 season, but many of the players he brought to Dallas helped the Cowboys become the first team to win three years over a four-year span after they defeated the Steelers in Super Bowl XXX. Johnson's contributions to those teams led to his Hall of Fame induction in 2021, four years after Jones received his gold jacket and bronze bust in Canton, Ohio. \nBill Cowher Cowher endured some lean years in Pittsburgh before retiring as a Super Bowl champion.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Cowher enjoyed immediate success in Pittsburgh. He was the youngest coach to reach the Super Bowl and joined Paul Brown as the only coaches to reach the postseason in each of their first six seasons as coach. Things quickly went south in 1998, however, as free agency decimated the Steelers' roster. Pittsburgh endured three straight non-playoff seasons that included the first two losing seasons of Cowher's career. Despite that, then-Steelers owner Dan Rooney gave Cowher a three-year extension going into the 2001 season. Cowher quickly rewarded Rooney's faith in him by leading the Steelers to a 13-3 record that season and an AFC title game appearance. Three years later, the Steelers won a franchise record 15 regular-season games with then-rookie Ben Roethlisberger leading the way. Cowher, Roethlisberger and the rest of the Steelers' team made history a year later by becoming the first sixth seed to win it all. Cowher, whose 15 years in Pittsburgh included a whopping nine trips to the divisional round and six AFC Championship game appearances, retired from coaching after the 2006 season and was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2021. Dick Vermeil After losing the Super Bowl 19 years earlier, Vermeil hosted the Vince Lombardi Trophy following the Rams' thrilling win over the Titans.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Vermeil could have received two pink slips during his Hall of Fame career. The Eagles won just nine games during his first two years before he led them to the postseason in 1978. Nearly two decades later, Vermeil once again own just nine games during his first two seasons with the Rams. While neither one started terribly well, Vermeil's tenures with the Eagles and Rams would eventually include Super Bowl appearances. He was the first coach to lead the Eagles to the big one, and 19 years after Philadelphia lost to the Raiders in Super Bowl XV, Vermeil won his elusive Super Bowl ring after the Rams edged the Titans in Super Bowl XXXIV. Vermeil ended his coaching career with the Chiefs and was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2022. Bill Belichick After going 5-13 in his first 18 games, Belichick ended his second season as the Patriots' coach as a Super Bowl champion.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            To the outside world, Belichick was just another veteran coach who had had success as a coordinator but had yet to prove himself as a head coach upon his arrival in New England. In that vein, it wouldn't have been a surprise to anyone if Robert Kraft decided to fire him after a 5-11 season in 2000. Kraft, after all, had just fired Pete Carroll despite the Patriots making the playoffs twice and not having a losing season in Carroll's three seasons in Foxborough. Kraft stuck with Belichick, though, and the result was the most successful run in NFL history. Belichick, Kraft, and quarterback Tom Brady enjoyed an iconic partnership that included six Super Bowl wins during their 20 seasons together. Belichick and Kraft parted ways in 2023 as the most successful coach-owner duo in league history. It could have turned out much differently, however, if Kraft failed to exercise some patience after things didn't initially go as planned. \n            ",

He and the rest of the field will tee off on Thursday from La Quinta Country Club, and Scheffler could figure into several PGA props or a golf parlay. He's the +280 favorite, per the latest 2026 American Express odds, despite never previously winning across five starts at this event. Thus, seeking out others to either top the leaderboard or have high finishes could be part of an American Express longshot parlay.Andrew Landry has both a victory and a runner-up at this tournament, and he's at +30000 to simply record a top-10 finish, per the latest golf props. That could be a standalone bet or one leg in what could be a lucrative PGA Tour parlay. From outright winners to top 10 finishes to even wagering on there being an ace, there are lots of options to consider. Before making any 2026 American Express picks or golf parlays, you need to see this PGA Tour parlay from the proven computer model at SportsLine.SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up over $8,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.This same model has also nailed a whopping 16 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- as well as this year's PGA Championship and Open Championship.

See the picks and full parlay by heading to SportsLine.Top 2026 American Express   parlay, PGA Tour picksFor the American Express 2026, one of the picks featured in the model's 5-leg PGA Tour parlay is Kurt Kitayama to have a top 10 finish at +360. Kitayama is coming off his best season on tour as he picked up his second victory and finished a career-best of 35th in the final standings. For the third straight year, Kitayama notched four top-10 finishes, including at a pair of courses that check in at under 7,300 yards at TPC Deere Run and TPC Southwind. That's relevant for the American Express, as La Quinta Country Club is just 7,060 yards, making it the fourth-shortest course in use for the 2026 season.\nHis length off the tee works in his favor on short courses as Kitayama ranked fifth in driving distance last season. However, he also has a nice touch with irons, as he was also in the top 10 on tour in strokes gained: tee-to-green. Kitayama played this event last year, and while he didn't have the best showing, he did shoot par or better in all four rounds. That experience should be invaluable this week as the model has him notching a top-10 finish (+360) despite his +4500 longshot odds to outright win. See the rest of the PGA Tour parlay legs here.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:How to make PGA Tour parlay picks The model has also picked an outright winner, plus a prop that returns +700 among its five PGA Tour picks for the 2026 American Express   parlay that pays almost $70,000 on just a $10 bet. You can only see the picks and the full parlay at SportsLine.\nSo, who will win the 2026 American Express, and what combination of PGA Tour props could unlock nearly a $70,000 payday on just a $10 bet?

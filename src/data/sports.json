    "body": "\n        Kenny Omega and AJ Styles will go down as two of the best professional wrestlers of their generation. Even though they are contemporaries in many ways, Omega has Styles to thank for three pivotal moments in his career.In September, Styles announced that he'd retire from professional wrestling next year. Omega vs. Styles is a dream match that never came to fruition, and likely won't. Despite wrestling for New Japan Pro Wrestling at the same time, the Bullet Club leaders' only meeting happened in 2006 on the Canadian independent scene. Before their match, Omega requested his release from WWE's developmental territory, Deep South Wrestling, after becoming disillusioned with the business. He had started competing in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu while contemplating a career in mixed martial arts.\"I wasn't sure if I'd continue wrestling after I left developmental,\" Omega told CBS Sports ahead of his match at Saturday's AEW Full Gear pay-per-view. \"When I saw the business end of professional wrestling, or at least what  was shown to be in developmental at that time, I thought, 'Maybe this  isn't for me because it isn't fun anymore. I don't feel like the  creativity I have access to on the indies is viable on that level.  Everything is micromanaged. Even the micromanaged stuff is micromanaged  from there. I felt I couldn't be me, and being me was fun.\"\nWith one foot out the door, an independent wrestling organization, Premier Canadian Wrestling, booked him a match with AJ Styles, a beloved TNA star. Omega saw an opportunity not to advance his career, but to give himself a send-off that he could be proud of.\"That's a great way to go out,\" Omega thought to himself. \"A good last match.\"The match had a profoundly large impact despite its small stage. What Omega thought was his swan song instead encouraged him to seek new heights.\"We had no interactions ever before, but there were moments in that match that really felt like the give and take felt so symbiotic,\" Omega said. \"The chemistry was naturally there. I thought, 'Wow, this is what wrestling someone at this level feels like. I'm not embarrassing myself. Maybe I'm not exactly keeping up, but I'm not embarrassing myself. Maybe if I push myself harder, I can reach this level.'\"\nOmega always dreamed of wrestling in Japan. Simply stepping into an NJPW ring was validating enough. But once again, crossing paths with Styles reframed how much Omega wanted out of pro wrestling. Omega, IWGP junior heavyweight champion at the time, took cues from how Styles carried himself as IWGP world heavyweight champion. \"Again, it was a  situation where what AJ had and could harness was what I wanted,\" Omega said. \"I  wanted to see that path. I wanted to see the making of a champion and  how you do it.\"With Styles' blessing, Omega was able to reform his Golden Lovers tag team with Kota Ibushi, a memorable moment for New Japan fans. But the Golden Lovers reformation was nowhere near as impactful as what came next. Styles was the leader of Bullet Club in Japan, one of the most influential factions of the last 20 years. Before departing for WWE, Styles passed the torch to Omega as Bullet Club leader, like Prince Devitt (Finn Balor) did before him. Omega and the Bullet Club betraying Styles was a tightly kept secret. \n\"AJ, having a keen sense of what's best for business, knew exactly how to go along with it,\" Omega said. \"In a way, by his turning his back and allowing for that moment to happen, whether he knows it or not, that led to the forming of The Elite.\"Omega argues that without this iteration of The Bullet Club, The Elite -- his stable with The Young Bucks -- might not exist. Without The Elite, there is no All Elite Wrestling.\"Ultimately, it kind of led to AEW,\" Omega said of Styles. \"Him being involved in our lives is very pivotal for the company and our careers.\"\nAEW President Tony Khan founded the promotion with Omega, Cody Rhodes, and The Young Bucks (Matt and Nick Jackson) serving as executive vice presidents. Omega and the Young Bucks continue waving that banner, one that Styles indirectly helped raise, six years later. At Saturday's Full Gear pay-per-view, Omega teams with Jurassic Express against the Young Bucks and Josh Alexander.\n            ",

Thursday Night Football hasn't produced the most high-flying offensive shootouts lately, and with the Texans starting backup quarterback Davis Mills again with the league's top-scoring defense backing him up, one of the SportsLine Projection Model's top picks is Under 43.5 total points.The model also sees value in NBA action, backing the Grizzlies to cover as 2.5-point favorites against the Kings as one of its Thursday best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook. One of SportsLine's top experts also has an NHL play. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins, plus 3 months of NBA League Pass free: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters Week 12 on a 48-33 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Thursday best bets at DraftKings SportsbookBills vs. Texans: Under 43.5 total points (-112)Grizzlies (-2.5) vs. Kings (-110)San Jose Sharks (+1.5) vs. Los Angeles Kings (-170)Combining the model's three picks into a Thursday parlay at DraftKings would result in a payout of +473 (risk $100 to win $473). Bet it at DraftKings here:\nBills vs. Texans: Under 43.5 total points (-112)Despite coming off a 76-point combined performance last week in a 44-32 victory over the Buccaneers, the Bills finished Under their over/under total in four of their last six games. Josh Allen was Superman with six touchdowns last week, but doing that against Tampa Bay is one thing. Replicating that success against the No. 1 defense in the NFL is a greater challenge. The Texans rank No. 1 in scoring defense (16.3 ppg allowed) and yards (258.1 per game) this season. Houston is coming off a 16-13 victory over the Jaguars, where the Under hit for the third time over their last four games. Combine this with Thursday Night Football having slower offensive performances in recent weeks, despite teams like the Patriots, Ravens and Broncos in action, and the model favors the Under on Thursday. The last three TNF games have finished Under 43.5 total points, and the model projects the Under to hit in 54% of simulations. Back the Under at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Grizzlies (-2.5) vs. Kings (-110)Neither of these teams are playing great basketball at the moment, with the Kings at 3-12 and the Grizzlies at 4-11 on the season. But the Grizzlies are home, and they've played much better in Memphis this season with a 3-5 record on their home floor. The Grizzlies return off an 0-4 road trip, but they are 1-1 over their last two home games, and the loss came to the defending NBA champion Oklahoma City Thunder. Ja Morant (calf) remains out, and Jaren Jackson Jr. (ankle) is doubtful for the Grizzlies, but the Kings have lost seven straight and may be without Domantas Sabonis, who missed the last game with a knee injury. The model projects the Grizzlies to cover in 65% of simulations. Back Memphis at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:San Jose Sharks (+1.5) vs. Los Angeles Kings (-170)\"The Kings are ridiculously good on the road, but this is the end of a massively long trip,\" SportsLine expert Matthew Severance said. \"And it's the front of a back-to-back. Backup Anton Forsberg (2.96 GAA), solid but a downgrade from Darcy Kuemper, already has been confirmed in net. Seven straight home games with at least a point for the Sharks, and that's all we need.\" Back the Sharks at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:\nWant more Thursday Night Football, NHL and NBA picks?You've seen some of the model's Thursday best bets.

    "body": "\n        The early signing period for the high school class of 2026 ended on Wednesday and there is a lot to unwrap. Many of the top players announced their decision a while ago, but some, such as Kaeli Wynn, decided to make their future coaches sweat a little before delivering the good news.The top 30 players have mostly all committed, with 247Sports' No. 11 Addison Bjorn being the latest announcement. On Thursday, the 6-foot-2 small forward from Missouri shared she is joining Texas. It has been a good few days for the Longhorns, who also got No. 12 Bri Crittendon on Wednesday and currently have the No. 1 recruiting class in the nation.No. 3 Jerzy Robinson is the only player from the top 30 who still hasn't announced her decision, which means she could likely be waiting until the spring. The official visits she has made so far include South Carolina and LSU.The regular signing window opens on April 16, 2026. Here are some of the biggest storylines after the early signing period.\nNorth Carolina gets No. 1 Kate Harpring The Tar Heels got the 274Sports No. 1 player of the class of 2026, Kate Harpring. Director of women's basketball scouting Brandon Clay said what earned her the top spot was her work ethic and discipline. Her family knows a thing or two about it because her dad played 10 years in the NBA alongside Hall of Famer Allen Iverson.\nAfter a process that took her about four years, and a chart she made to help her organize her thoughts, Harpring announced her decision over the summer. She said Courtney Banghart seems like the perfect head coach for her, and she also liked the \"family vibes\" at the UNC campus. She averaged 32 points and 10 rebounds per game during her junior season at Marist School in Atlanta. While she knows college is a whole different level, she is going to arrive in Chapel Hill with high expectations.\"Obviously winning the national championship would be the main goal.\" she told CBS Sports. \"That would be the top goal, but also just growing and getting better. Just being the best I can for my team. It's going to be like a completely different thing than I've ever done before obviously, that's the change that everyone has. But just to be the best player I can be and try to be one of the best in college basketball.\"\nTexas has the No. 1 classThe Longhorns are fresh off a Final Four appearance and their future under coach Vic Schaefer continues to look bright. No. 11 Addison Bjorn recently surprised the team during a practice and had her future teammates screaming with joy. \"We did it!\" was the response from star player Maddison Booker, who will be a senior next year.The celebration was well-warranted because Texas now has the No. 1 recruiting class in the nation. Bjorn is joining No. 12 Bri Crittendon, No. 18 Aaliah Spaight and No. 57 Amalia Holguin. Bjorn's commitment bumped Texas a fraction above Notre Dame for the No. 1 spot, should things hold. \nUSC adds another top recruit After JuJu Watkins and Jazzy Davidson, the Trojans scored yet another recruiting triumph thanks to the addition of No. 2 Saniyah Hall. During Watkins' freshman year, the program reached the Elite Eight for the first time since 1994. They ran it back this past season and now Davidson will try to take the team on another deep run while Watkins is out with a torn ACL.\nUSC was one of the top programs in the nation in the 80s when it won two national titles. The Trojans are back under the spotlight, and head coach Lindsay Gottlieb said the addition of Hall will help them keep the momentum going. She visited Hall during her sophomore year in Cleveland and right away the coach knew the Trojans had to heavily pursue her.\"I already knew she was good, but I was blown away,\" Gottlieb said. \"The way she interacted with her teammates, the energy she brought to the floor, I could tell the elite level talent she was. I was like, this is the best player in the country. This is the kid we need in this class.\"\nUConn is not going anywhereThe Huskies' future already looks bright with Sarah Strong, who is fresh off of a historic freshman season in which she played a key role in winning UConn's 12th national championship. They will add another young weapon next year in Olivia Vukosa, the No. 4 player of the 247Sports rankings. \nShe averaged 19.4 points, 17.9 rebounds, 5.5 blocks and 3.8 assists per game during her junior season. UConn head coach Geno Auriemma said her versatility makes her a perfect fit for the program.\"We think Olivia is one of those players that we've had so much success with,\" Auriemma said.\" She's a big kid who can move, she has skills, she's smart. She works really hard at both ends of the floor. She comes from a great program. I think she's the kind of basketball big kid that the game demands today. She's a terrific kid and comes from a great family. We're really lucky, and we're excited to have her here.\"Kaeli Wynn surprised Dawn StaleySouth Carolina was competing with Stanford for 6-foot-2 power forward Kaeli Wynn, who is ranked No. 39 in the 247Sports rankings, and a text from Wynn asking the coach for a phone call made Dawn Staley worry.\n\"The night before, she was like, 'Can we talk tomorrow?'\" Staley said. \"And I swear, I don't like those, 'Can we talk tomorrow' (texts). They don't feel good. And it didn't feel good. So I'm like, 'Can we talk tonight? Tell me tonight!' That was the night before.\"Wynn declined, saying she was busy attending a fundraiser. Staley said she \"felt the energy\" and told her coaching staff that Stanford probably got Wynn, who is a California native. However, the Gamecocks got a happy surprise during practice the following day.\nTennessee's legacy still mattersTennessee is one of the most successful programs in women's college basketball history with eight national titles. That legacy still attracts some of the most talented players in the country. Oliviyah Edwards, the No. 5 player in the class of 2026, chose the Lady Vols over programs such as USC, South Carolina and LSU.\nThe 6-foot-3 forward averaged 17 points and 7.8 rebounds on 63.5% shooting this past season. She will also bring some excitement to Knoxville with her dunking ability.\"I chose the University of Tennessee because I felt welcomed from the very beginning,\" Edwards told ESPN. \"The freshman class reached out and made me feel a part of the family right away. Most importantly, I love their style of play and the freedom it gives me on the court. This program has an amazing legacy, and I cannot wait to be a part of it.\"\nIowa is still on the map Jan Jensen has done a great job keeping the momentum going for Iowa in the post-Caitlin Clark Era and just signed the highest-rated player to join the Hawkeyes since Clark left for the WNBA. McKenna Woliczko, ranked No. 6, is a 6-foot-2 forward who Clay described as one of the best rebounders in the nation with elite energy on both sides of the court. \nDuring her junior year at Archbishop Mitty in San Jose, Woliczko averaged 22.1 points and 8.9 rebounds in 10 games before a season-ending knee injury. \"She's versatile. Boy, she can hit a three but handles the ball with ease,\" Jensen said. \"She can get to the rim. She can rebound. She's smart. She's a leader. Just a great, great kid. Great family. Getting that type of person, first and foremost, and then the type of player she is on top of it — that was just a really huge moment for us. Hawk fans are really going to enjoy watching her because she has a versatile game. It's smooth. It's pretty, and it's very impactful.\"Other winnersThe Fighting Irish are going through a significant rebuilding season, only returning three players from last year's roster. The team is led by junior Hannah Hidalgo, which is certainly a great place to start. However, this next incoming class could also mean a bright future for Notre Dame. The Fighting Irish have four players in the top 30, the most from any other program. These are No. 16 Jacy Abii, No. 19 Bella Ragone, No. 23 Amari Byles and No. 27 Jenica Lewis.\nDuke got two top 15 players in No. 7 Autumn Fleary and No. 13 Bella Flemings. Meanwhile, Kentucky got No. 8 Maddyn Greenway and No. 14 Savvy Swords. The top programs were not the only ones who won big. Clemson took No. 9 Trinity Jones and Nebraska got No. 10 Ashlyn Koupal.\"I chose Clemson because I knew Coach Poppie and the staff saw more than a basketball player -- they saw just Trinity, a girl who happens to be good at basketball,\" Jones told ESPN. \"I trust them with helping me get to the next level.\"\n            ",

Now it looks like he's going to miss the entire season. Mixon isn't expected to play at all this year, per NFL Media. It's a shocking turn of events for someone who was voted to the Pro Bowl in 2024 during his first season in Houston. Texans general manager Nick Caserio was actually asked about Mixon's injury this week, and at the time, he gave an ominous update on the running back's health. \"I know that we've been asked about this multiple times and it's not that I'm trying to be evasive, it's just a very gray situation,\" Caserio told Sports Radio 610 in Houston. \"Joe's worked at it. There were times when he's made progress and other times when the progress is kind of stalled there a little bit. Players in his situation are on the reserve list until they're not, so Joe's doing everything he can.\"During the interview, Caserio hinted that Mixon might not play again this season. \n\"Obviously, we're getting pretty late in the game here. I don't want to establish any sort of expectations,\" Caserio said. \"A month ago or whatever it was, I mentioned we'd have a better idea here in the next three or four weeks, or whatever it was. I don't think we have any more clarity at this point. I think, at this point, he's out until he's not. It's a very gray, a lot of ambiguity, there's not a lot of clarity. It's nobody's fault, it's just the reality of the situation.\"With Mixon out, the Texans have been forced to rely on Woody Marks and Nick Chubb. Marks is a rookie fourth-round pick who has shown flashes this season but still hasn't topped 70 yards in a single game. As for Chubb, the Texans signed the former Browns star just before mandatory minicamp in June after it became clear Mixon wouldn't be able to participate. So what's going on with Mixon? Let's take a look at the timeline of his injury. \nJoe Mixon injury timelineThe Mixon injury timeline started in May when he wasn't able to participate in OTAs, and it's only gotten more mysterious with each passing day. Let's take a look at what's happened over the past few months. May 2025: Mixon missed Houston's OTAs and minicamp with what was believed to be an ankle injury. (Mixon missed three games in 2024 due to an ankle injury.) At the time, one Texans beat reporter said he expected the running back to be ready for the start of training camp. July 2025: The Texans reported to training camp on July 22, and one day later, Mixon was placed on the NFI list (non-football injury), which implies that Mixon suffered his mysterious foot injury while away from the team. The severity of the injury wasn't clear until July 26 when news came out that Mixon would be missing a substantial portion of the preseason due to a \"frustrating foot injury.\" Aug. 25, 2025: For most of August, the Texans were mum about Mixon's injury, but on Aug. 25, they made a huge move: They kept him on the NFI list for the regular season, which meant that he was going to have to miss at least four games. At the time, the Texans didn't give any indication that Mixon might miss more than four games. Caserio simply said Mixon would be re-evaluated once he was eligible to return. \"With all injured players, you kind of take it one day at a time,\" Caserio said on Aug. 27. \"Whatever the timeline is, we handle it accordingly. The players that are on PUP or NFI, they're out four games or four weeks. So once we get through four weeks, we'll evaluate at that time.\"Oct. 7, 2025: Mixon was eligible to come off the NFI list in Week 5, but that didn't happen. After Mixon didn't play in Houston's 44-10 win over the Ravens in Week 5 (Oct. 5), Caserio was asked about the running back's status. \"He's making progress, so we won't put a particular timetable on it, so I think over the next few three or four weeks, we'll probably get a little more information here, kind of see how he's progressing,\" Caserio said on Oct. 7. \"Once we kind of get to that period, probably have a better sense of which way it's going to go for the duration of the year.\"Oct. 27, 2025: Texans coach DeMeco Ryans was asked if he had any sort of update on Mixon's health and answered with three words. \"I do not,\" Ryans said on Oct. 27. At the time of Ryans' interview, Mixon had already missed seven games, and based on the coach's comments, it was pretty clear he wasn't coming back anytime soon. Nov. 18, 2025: This is the day Caserio did his most recent interview and based on his comments, it seemed pretty clear Mixon probably wouldn't return this year. \"It's a very gray, a lot of ambiguity, there's not a lot of clarity. It's nobody's fault, it's just the reality of the situation,\" Caserio said. Nov. 20, 2025: NFL Media reported that Mixon \"is not expected\" to play again this season. If Mixon is truly done for the year, it's a dramatic and mysterious fall for one of the best offensive players on the team. During the 2024 season, Mixon led the Texans in rushing with 1,016 yards and came up big in both of Houston's playoff games. In the wild card round, he rushed for 106 yards and a touchdown in a 32-12 win over the Chargers. In the divisional round, he added 88 yards and a touchdown in a 23-14 loss to the Chiefs. Without Mixon, the Texans started 0-3 this season. Although they've clawed their way back to 5-5, they certainly would have been able to use him for their Thursday night showdown in Week 12 against a Bills team that's given up the second-most rushing yards in the NFL this year. \nFor Mixon, who spent the first seven seasons of his career with the Bengals before being traded to Houston in March 2024, it's fair to wonder if the 29-year-old is ever going to play again. The two-time Pro Bowler clearly has a lingering injury, and with the team giving vague details (and Mixon offering zero updates at all), it seems to be more serious than anyone is letting on. \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 Major League Baseball offseason is fully underway, and we're working our way through the sport's offseason calendar. Among other things, the winter in baseball means a steady supply of rumors regarding free agent signings, trades, and the like. Speaking of which, you can find Thursday's roundup just below. Yankees interested in Williams reunion\nRighty reliever Devin Williams in his lone season in the Bronx was plagued by inconsistency and prolonged periods of struggle, but beneath it all the two-time All-Star still had strong underlying fundamentals. That's why the Yankees may be interested in bringing back Williams, who's a free agent this winter.Indeed, the Athletic reports that the Yankees and Williams' representatives have indeed been discussing an agreement that would keep him in pinstripes for 2026 and perhaps beyond. The 31-year-old right-hander will enter next season with 86 saves and a career ERA+ of 172. In his 297 ⅔ career innings at the highest level, Williams has struck out 465 batters. Okamoto posted for MLB teams, joins free agent poolThe Yomiuri Giants of Nippon Professional Baseball have posted 1B/3B Kazuma Okamoto, MLB announced on Thursday. This means all 30 MLB teams will have 45 days to negotiate a free agent contract with Okamoto. Recently, CBS Sports ranked Okamoto as the No. 3 NPB/KBO player who may make the leap to the U.S. major leagues this offseason. Here's part of R.J. Anderon's write-up of Okamoto: \nBelieve it or not, there are statistical models that favor Okamoto's chances of succeeding against MLB pitching to Murakami's. At minimum, Okamoto has, to his credit, done a better job than Murakami at keeping his swing-and-miss and strikeout rates in check. To his debt, he's a few years older (30 next June) and he's a right-handed hitter. Okamoto's market may be dictated by how teams feel about his defense at the hot corner. Should they deem him unfit there, there will be more pressure on his bat.Okamoto is 29 and he's slugged .501 with 277 home runs across parts of 11 seasons in Japan.Braves acquire Dubón from AstrosThe Braves and Astros swung a trade of infielders late Wednesday, as Mauricio Dubón heads to Atlanta in exchange for Nick Allen. Dubón, 31, is coming off a 2025 season in which he batted .241/.289/.355 with seven home runs in 133 games for Houston. For his career, he owns an OPS+ of 85 across parts of seven MLB seasons. Defensively, Dubón is a two-time Gold Glove winner as a utility player and he's spent meaningful time at seven different positions. With the Braves, he figures to be their primary shortstop in 2026. Dubón will be eligible for free agency after the 2026 season. \nAs for the 27-year-old Allen, he has a 55 OPS+ in 1,176 career plate appearances spread over four big-league seasons. He's spent most of his time at shortstop, but he's also capable of playing anywhere else in the infield. He'll enter the 2026 season with between two and three years of MLB service time and figures to fill a bench role for Houston. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Joe Mazzulla is one of a kind. When he's not watching \"The Town\" or avoiding revolving doors or torturing overmatched reporters in pickup basketball, he's known to give some memorable press conferences. Most recently, a kid reporter from SI Kids asked Mazzulla, at Kids Day at the Garden, how he balances pushing his players with keeping the game fun. Did we mention it was a kid reporter from a kid publication on Kids Day at the Garden? This is an important point.\"I struggle with that, to be honest with you,\" Mazzulla replied. \"I think everyone has a different definition of fun. You have to find one as a team. I think fun is a cop out sometimes. When things aren't going well everybody likes to say 'well, let's just have fun.' It's like, well, what does that mean? I think you have to define what fun looks like as a team and you kind of have to go after it. That phrase can be a cop out sometimes. So as you get older, kid, don't use it.\" \nSo as you get older, kid, don't use it.Even if Mazzulla wasn't impervious to whimsy, this Celtics season never felt like it was going to lend itself to him sending his guys out on the floor to just have fun anyway. Boston left fun in the rearview the moment Jayson Tatum blew out his Achilles. After that, one of the most stable organizations in the NBA was left to dismantle what it had meticulously built and reconfigure on the fly. \nMaybe that was going to happen even if Tatum had remained healthy, but once he got hurt, taking a gap year was the obvious play. Out went Jrue Holiday, Kristaps Porzingis, Al Horford and Luke Kornet as cost-cutting casualties who were sold off to avoid the franchise having to pay roughly half a billion dollars for a roster that would be without its best player. Just two seasons ago, the Celtics steamrolled their way to their 18th championship and people were wondering if a dynasty might be dawning. Now Neemias Queta is starting and Mazzulla has a rotation with 11 different players averaging at least 10 minutes per game. It has been a weird season for the Celtics. They've gone from knowing exactly who they are and how they want to play to the basketball equivalent of an \"Eat, Pray, Love\" journey to find themselves . Night to night they are chaos agents, as capable of losing to the Jazz by two as they are of smacking the Cavs by 20. Maybe Celtics fans who were accustomed to consistency and regular wins don't feel this way, but, as a neutral observer, Boston's unpredictability has made for tremendous content.The Celtics of recent vintage have had a defined theory of the case: play staunch defense while taking and making the most threes in the NBA, as they did in each of the last two seasons. Maybe you could catch them on a cold shooting night or maybe they go into a funk for a stretch, but they were betting that their personnel would win the math game more times than not. To an extent, the Celtics are still trying to play that way, just with an expanded cast of characters that's not nearly as suited to it as the teams that preceded this one. And let's not forget that certain players are having to shoulder more of the offensive load than ever before due to Tatum being out and several of their key contributors from previous seasons are now playing elsewhere.\nDerrick White is averaging 15.4 field goal attempts (by far the most of his career) but he's off to an icy shooting start (35.9 percent from the field and 30.5 from deep). Both are career lows, though his counting stats from assists to steals to blocks remain considerable. Last year's Sixth Man of the Year Payton Pritchard was uneven early (and hard on himself about it), but has been considerably better of late. Sharpshooter Sam Hauser hasn't really been sharp at all and is posting career lows in field-goal and three-point percentages. Among the notable holdovers, only former Finals MVP Jaylen Brown has regularly leveled up, averaging 27.5 points on 50.3 percent shooting from the field. Both are career bests.Despite not having the same offensive arsenal they once boasted, there have been glimmers. The Celtics still like to fire from deep. Boston is second in three-point attempts per game and sixth in three-pointers made. They're sixth in offensive rating, 11th in defensive rating, eighth in net rating and have the third-best point differential in the Eastern Conference. That all looks pretty good at first glance. But even after beating the Brooklyn Nets on Tuesday, the Celtics are 8-7 and just inside the play-in. There's a case to be made that they could be 10-5 with this bunch -- or just as easily 5-10. \nThey're not great in transition (26th in fast break points) or down low (29th points in the paint) and they're one of just seven teams playing at a slower pace than last season. But their bunch of scrappy try-hards have been fairly effective at slowing down other teams in transition (eighth in opponents fast break points) and they've been excellent at limiting the competition from scoring off their mistakes (first in opponents points off turnovers).It all distills down to a team with a wider variance of outcomes night-to-night than what we're used to seeing from the usually steady Boston Celtics. They're not the set-it-and-forget-it lineup that was all but assured of making deep playoff runs for the last several seasons. They are, however, a franchise that got out from what would have been a crushing second apron situation and continue to be a tough opponent most evenings while waiting for Tatum to mend. In a season that everyone in Boston knew would come with certain difficulties, that's not bad. That's not nothing. It has even been, at times and with apologies to Mazzulla, fun in its own way. The other night in the win at Brooklyn, there was a sequence that summed up this Celtics experience nicely when they missed three 3s in a row on the same possession but got all the rebounds. Boston TV analyst Brian Scalabrine watched it unfold and squealed with delight \"championship-caliber squad! They've been there before.\" If that's not entertainment, nothing is.  \n            ",

The two are set to throw down in December after Paul moved on from his original opponent, Gervonta \"Tank\" Davis, Paul vs. Joshua is a professional boxing match, unlike the exhibition fight that Paul was previously working towards. This means the result will impact their pro records. Paul (12-1, 6 KOs) and Joshua (28-4, 25 KOs) will wear the standard 10-ounce gloves used by heavyweights. Paul has competed in 10-ounce gloves for most of his career, excluding the unusual 14-ounce gloves used for his fight with \"Iron\" Mike Tyson. Against Davis, Paul was planning to wear 12-ounce gloves.  The Dec. 19 fight will be contested at heavyweight, stripping Paul of his normal weight advantage against opponents. Paul normally competes at cruiserweight, 65 pounds higher than WBA champion Davis' usual weight class. Paul's only previous heavyweight fight was against Tyson, who was 30 years older than Paul. However, there is a stipulation that says Joshua cannot weigh more than 245 pounds for the bout.\nPerhaps the only stipulation benefiting Paul is the round totals. Joshua has exclusively competed in 12-round fights for the last decade, excluding a 10-round maximum for his short fight with Francis Ngannou. His fight with Paul is scheduled for eight three-minute rounds. With many believing Joshua will knock out Paul, this reduces the time Paul must theoretically survive.Paul is preparing for undoubtedly the biggest challenge of his career. The crossover star made a career by seeking opponents whose name value greatly outweighed their boxing experience, or who were significantly older or smaller than him. Though Joshua is 36 and likely beyond his prime, he should possess everything necessary to make short work of his opponent. Joshua is a two-time unified heavyweight champion and Olympic gold medalist. Last year, he knocked out former UFC heavyweight champion Francis Ngannou in two rounds after Ngannou took Tyson Fury to a split decision.\nPaul vs. Joshua takes place Dec. 19 inside Miami's Kaseya Center.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The penultimate week of the college football season is typically quiet, especially in comparison to the intense rivalry clashes that Week 14 often brings. But the expanded College Football Playoff, which has created an opportunity at meaningful postseason football for a greater number of teams, definitely adds some heat to this weekend's slate. For instance, all eyes will be on No. 15 USC's trip to No. 7 Oregon. For the Trojans, this is a make-or-break game. They've already collected two losses, which is typically the threshold for an at-large Power Four program. Playing in the Big Ten has its perks. There are major implications for Oregon, as well. The Ducks are 9-1, but they finish the year with a trip to rival Washington. It's never wise to let ranked home games slip by, either, especially when Oregon is in the conversation to host a first-round playoff game. There are a few impactful games beyond that to dive into, though it is the only matchup between top-25 opponents on Saturday's schedule. \nWe here at CBS Sports have been overreacting to each college football weekend for a while now. Let's try and manifest some into existence for a change ahead of the 13th week of the season. USC solidifies an at-large bid \nTV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App (free), Paramount+ PremiumIt's been almost five years since Lincoln Riley made his last College Football Playoff appearance. He's never even come close to reaching that benchmark with the Trojans. That will change on Saturday. \nUSC has, quietly, been one of the hottest teams in the nation over the last month and change. The Trojans are 4-1 since Oct. 11, with the lone loss in that span coming on the road against Notre Dame. That includes victories over a pair of top-25 opponents in Michigan and Iowa (the Hawkeyes were No. 21 in the College Football Playoff rankings on Nov. 15). Riley's USC tenure will reach new heights Saturday when the Trojans down Oregon, an old Pac-12 foe that is 0-1 in its only game against a currently ranked opponent. The Trojans have the talent to win outside against Oregon's defense, which currently leads the Big Ten against the pass (127.3 yards per game). Running back King Miller could be the key to USC's victory, though. He's had great rushing performances against some staunch fronts like Michigan, Notre Dame and Iowa. USC will have to limit Oregon, as well, but the Trojans are built to win a shootout. \nA Week 13 win virtually guarantees an at-large bid for USC, provided it takes care of business in its regular season finale versus UCLA. Oklahoma can smother its way to a title \nRealistically speaking, it's hard to think of Oklahoma as a legitimate national title contender. The Sooners do not have the offensive output to consistently keep up with high-level programs like Ohio State, Indiana and Texas A&M. Their struggle to consistently move the ball will ultimately doom them, as it did in a loss to Texas. But the recipe for a title run is there, thanks in large part to a stifling defense that -- on a perfect day -- can take total control of a game. Oklahoma's win against Alabama in Week 12 was a perfect day. \nThe Sooners put star Crimson Tide quarterback Ty Simpson in a bind with a ferocious pass rush and some confounding coverage looks. They also continued their trend of manufacturing impactful turnovers, as they forced Simpson to throw just his second interception of the year -- which they returned for a touchdown -- and also got to Simpson for a strip-sack. Oklahoma also held Alabama's offense scoreless for the final 22:27 of gametime. They're going to put up a similar performance against Missouri Saturday. Here's another bold prediction, wrapped inside a predicted overreaction: Oklahoma will hold star Missouri running back Ahmad Hardy under 60 yards rushing. The Sooners are very good at identifying an offense's strength and taking that off the board. That strategy from Brent Venables could take his team far. \nThe ACC gets turned on its head (again) \nThe ACC has been one of college football's more chaotic conferences this offseason. Preseason favorites like Clemson and Florida State have dropped off of a proverbial cliff while the likes of Georgia Tech and Virginia make a push for the conference championship game. Expect more major change this weekend. No. 16 Georgia Tech hosts a Pittsburgh team reeling from a blowout loss to classic rival Notre Dame. The Panthers are still in the thick of the ACC hunt with a 5-1 conference record. If they win, they'll enter the driver's seat. That would also open the door for teams like SMU and even Miami to reenter the fray. The Mustangs have a big home game against Louisville while the Hurricanes are at Virginia Tech. \nBob Chesney is the next Curt Cignetti \nEveryone is searching for the next Curt Cignetti, especially during a 2025-26 coaching carousel that has already seen several major jobs open up -- with likely more on the way. Well, interested parties may not have to look very far. James Madison itself has another Cignetti-like coach on the payroll. Bob Chesney's Dukes are 9-1 and they're right in the thick of the College Football Playoff race. If they beat Washington State Saturday, there's a chance that they'll enter pole position for the Group of Six's playoff bid, though there is stiff competition from the American Conference. Chesney's résumé is very similar to Cignetti's. Like Cignetti, he started at the lower levels of NCAA football (in his case, Division III) and steadily worked his way up to an FCS opportunity at Holy Cross, where he won five-straight Patriot League titles from 2019-23. \nHe's had just one losing season as a head coach and that was way back in 2018, his first year with Holy Cross. Bob Chesney will almost certainly find his way to a new job this offseason.  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 college football season is entering crunch time. There are just two full weeks left before all eyes turn towards conference championship games and, beyond that, the final College Football Playoff Rankings reveal, which will set the 12-team field in stone. That means every single game from this point forwards matters a little bit more. Some teams, like No. 1 Ohio State, No. 2 Indiana and No. 3 Texas A&M, feel good about their odds to make the playoff regardless of what happens down the stretch. There's a wider swath of teams left on the bubble, though. It seems as if there will be a glut of two-loss -- and even a handful of three-loss -- teams pushing for an at-large bid over the next couple of weeks. Most programs within the top 20 of the latest CFP Rankings have a chance of making the final cut, at the very least. \nSuffice to say, there's a lot on the line for a lot of prominent teams as the 2025 season nears its conclusion. Here's a look at the Week 13 contests that matter in the College Football Playoff race and the implications for both teams involved.   No. 15 USC at No. 7 Oregon \nBarring something entirely unexpected, the Big Ten Championship Game is essentially set as Ohio State and Indiana appear destined to meet in Indianapolis. But this matchup between two teams near the top of the standings still carries major stakes. Oregon has navigated a tricky end-of-season slate well and is in strong position for one of the playoff's at-large spots. The Ducks could even afford another loss, though beating a ranked opponent at home would bolster their résumé with a tough trip to Washington looming to close the regular season.For USC, this is a must-win. The Trojans have climbed back into the race with quality victories over Michigan, Nebraska and Iowa, but Oregon represents an entirely different caliber of opponent. A win would be a significant statement with less than three weeks before the selection committee releases its final rankings. USC is already on the two-loss threshold, so another defeat would likely knock the Trojans out of at-large contention.\nNo. 22 Missouri at No. 8 Oklahoma \nMissouri is, for all intents and purposes, out of the playoff hunt. The Tigers do not have a win over a currently ranked opponent. That could change Saturday, but there's no guarantee that beating Oklahoma would vault them into at-large range, especially with several Power Four teams still ahead in the pecking order.Oklahoma, meanwhile, has plenty on the line. The Sooners have been road warriors in recent weeks, picking up back-to-back wins at No. 20 Tennessee and No. 10 Alabama. That run has them firmly in the at-large field. But with two losses already, their margin for error is gone. There isn't expected to be much room for any three-loss team once December arrives -- even one with a résumé as strong as Oklahoma's.Pittsburgh at No. 16 Georgia Tech \nPittsburgh wilted in its biggest moment of the season, falling 37-15 to old rival Notre Dame. The final score is deceiving, as the gap between the Panthers and the Fighting Irish looked even wider on the field. Pitt subsequently dropped out of the College Football Playoff rankings. The Panthers can still play spoiler against a couple of conference foes to close the season and, more importantly, their ACC Championship Game hopes remain alive. Get there, and the playoff stays within reach.\nGeorgia Tech, meanwhile, literally controls its own destiny. All the Yellow Jackets need to do is beat Pittsburgh to lock up a spot in the ACC Championship Game. That appears to be their clearest playoff path, as the selection committee continues to rank Miami -- which has no realistic route to the title game -- ahead of every other ACC team for an at-large bid.No. 11 BYU at Cincinnati BYU sits just outside the latest College Football Playoff bracket, with the bubble-entrenched Cougars chasing No. 10 Alabama and No. 9 Notre Dame. Like several others, they control their own destiny: win out and they're likely headed for a rematch with Texas Tech in the Big 12 Championship Game. The trip to Cincinnati won't be easy. The Bearcats have dropped two straight, but they appeared in the first two CFP rankings releases and remain a dangerous opponent.Cincinnati can still technically reach the Big 12 title game, but it needs help. Beating BYU would be a crucial first step, giving the Bearcats the head-to-head edge over the Cougars. From there, they'd need a series of breaks -- including losses by Arizona State, Houston and Utah -- to keep the path alive.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        There's a bit of symmetry with the Week 12 NFL odds as three games have a spread of a field goal or less, while three contests also have a double-digit NFL line. Amongst the former are Steelers vs. Bears (-2.5), with Aaron Rodgers (wrist) availability in questions, and Jaguars vs. Cardinals (+2.5), while double-digit favorites to place Week 12 NFL bets on are Seattle (-13.5) versus Tennessee and Detroit (-10.5) versus the Giants. However, it's a team that isn't even over .500 which is the biggest favorite on the Week 12 NFL schedule.Baltimore has won four straight to get back into the playoff picture, and they'll host the Jets on Sunday. The Ravens are at -13.5 to use in Week 12 NFL picks, and while double-digit favorites are 10-1 straight up this season, they are just 6-5 ATS. One of those games whose spread falls in between the aforementioned extremes is Chiefs vs. Colts, which has another .500 team in Kansas City as 3.5-point favorites over an 8-2 Colts squad coming off a bye. All of the updated Week 12 NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Week 12 NFL picks now. LIMITED TIME: Use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1 JOIN NOW. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your initial $5 bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

Arizona is 6-1 ATS versus AFC opponents since 2024, which is the second-best spread record for any team in non-conference matchups. Meanwhile, the Jags are just 1-4 ATS this year outside of Jacksonville, and the takeaways that fueled their early success have nearly dried up. The Jaguars averaged 3.3 takeaways over their first four games but have averaged just 0.8 turnovers forced per game over their last six. Thus, extra offensive possessions for Arizona allow it to take advantage of the Jags' 26th-ranked passing defense, as Jacoby Brissett is projected to have more yards and touchdowns than Trevor Lawrence. With that, the Cardinals cover in over 50% of simulations. See which other teams to pick here.\nAnother one of its Week 12 NFL predictions: the Ravens (-13.5, 44.5) cover versus the Jets in well over 50% of simulations. New York is coming off a mini-bye, having played last Thursday, but there's no spread advantage with this rest edge. The Jets are 3-11-1 ATS over their last 15 games when they have a rest advantage over their opponent. Their Sunday opponent, Baltimore, has recently looked like the team most expected them to be all season as the Ravens have allowed just 14.8 points over their last five games. That includes a pair of games versus top-10 scoring offenses, but the team doesn't have to worry about seeing that with the Jets, who rank dead last in passing offense and 25th in scoring. Baltimore covers with points to spare, and the model also says the Over hits in over 70% of simulations. See which other teams to pick here.\nHow to make Week 12 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 12 NFL schedule and just revealed five teams projected to win by double-digits, potentially giving you a huge payday by playing the alternate lines.

    "body": "\n        The NBA's interest in expanding its global reach has been well documented, and it goes beyond just playing preseason and regular season games in various countries. Commissioner Adam Silver has talked about the possibility of starting an NBA Europe league on numerous occasions, and more information about the league's plans have been trickling out in recent weeks. Silver has mentioned that there's been significant ownership interest from \"a lot of well known wealthy European families, American families and institutions,\" and with the backing of the NBA, it's certainly something that could happen in the near future. Silver previously pointed to 2027 or 2028 as a potential start date, and NBA Europe managing director George Aivazoglou said at a conference in Italy earlier this month that October 2027 is being targeted as the potential launch date for the league, according to The Associated Press. The current plan for the league consists of 16 teams, 12 of which would be permanent members, Aivazoglou said. Here's a list of the target countries and cities that could get teams, via the AP. Nothing has been formalized by the NBA. Great Britain: London and ManchesterFrance: Paris and LyonSpain: Madrid and BarcelonaItaly: Rome and MilanGermany: Munich and BerlinGreece: AthensTürkiye: IstanbulThe remaining four teams would qualify to join the league by winning either FIBA's Champions League, or based on their performance in their domestic leagues, Aivazoglou said. There have been no deals made with any cities or existing clubs. However, NBA deputy commissioner Mark Tatum did mention specific clubs that could be considered while speaking at a Sports Business Journal Dealmakers conference.\n\n        \n            \n                NBA commissioner Adam Silver isn't worried about losing talent to European league, but maybe he should be\n                \n                    Jasmyn Wimbish                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nReal Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich are three teams Tatum mentioned by name as clubs that could be permanent members of the NBA Europe league.\"There's nothing definitive yet,\" Tatum said, via The Athletic. \"We're having conversations with lots of potential investors in the ecosystem. Those were examples of potential teams. As I said, I think the mix will be an example of existing teams in the current top-tier league, some soccer teams that don't have a basketball club and some teams from whole cloth.\"Aivazoglou said that the first season may not feature all 16 teams as the league gets off the ground, but that is the long-term hope. Another feature under consideration with the creation of this league is having NBA teams face some of the European squads.\n\"One of the things that we'll do very soon after we launch this league is probably create a new tournament,\" Aivazoglou said.That tournament could be similar to the FIFA World Cup, but it would differ because players wouldn't necessarily be playing for their home countries. Tatum also alluded to the two leagues playing games against each other with the NBA Cup used as the trophy they'd be fighting for.\"In the immediate short term, you could see a competition, think about it as a preseason Cup, where NBA teams go over and play against European league teams,\" Tatum said. \"And you'd create a little tournament around that, where the Knicks and the Lakers and the Bulls go over and play PSG, Real and Man City. So that we could do year one, and I think that would be an exciting proposition. You award a cup at the end of that. Medium term — and I mean, you know, five to 10 years down the road — you could see a situation where the winners of the top two finishers in the European league, for example, get entered into the NBA Cup tournament. So now all of a sudden, you are having AC Milan and Barcelona playing in the NBA Cup tournament.\"If this league were to get off the ground, it would certainly create some competition for the NBA. Silver has said in the past that he isn't concerned about losing talent to this league, but that doesn't mean it won't happen. It won't be an immediate concern, but perhaps down the line some top international players may consider staying in Europe instead of playing in the NBA in the United States.On paper, this sounds like an exciting new venture for the league, and would be a great representation of how global the sport of basketball really is. There's a record 135 international players on NBA rosters this season, which represents roughly 30% of the total players in the league. This new league would show just how much global interest there is in basketball, and allows the NBA to expand on a level that can only be compared to soccer.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        After being named NWSL commissioner in 2022, Jessica Berman is staying on as the executive face of the league. The NWSL announced that Berman has signed a multi-year contract extension on Thursday. The news comes ahead of the NWSL Championship set to take place on Saturday. CBS is the official home of the NWSL Championship, and fans can watch second-place Washington Spirit take on eighth-place Gotham FC for the title. After navigating a year of highs and lows for the commissioner, the league and its board of governors are re-upping Berman and extending her time in charge. Ultimately, it's the wins throughout her previous four years that brought on Berman's new contract extension. New record-setting media rights deals, the first and second collective bargaining agreements, skyrocketing club valuations, and welcoming new expansion markets in the Bay Area, Utah, Boston, Denver, and the newest market -- Atlanta. \"Jessica's leadership has been instrumental in transforming the NWSL into a global sports property,\" said Carolyn Tisch Blodgett, Gotham FC owner and NWSL executive committee chair. \"Her vision for sustainable growth, along with her ability to fuel enduring momentum, has positioned the league for long-term success.\"Tisch Blodgett is just one of several high-profile investors who have joined NWSL ownership groups under Berman's time as commissioner. Several athletes, celebrities, venture capitalists, and tech industry leaders are now involved in club ownership groups across the league. The league has expanded from 12 to 17 clubs under Berman.\n\"It's been the honor of my career to lead the NWSL during such an extraordinary period of growth,\" said Berman. \"Every success we've achieved, from expansion to investment to the player experience, is the result of collaboration across this league. I'm proud of what we've built and even more excited about where we're headed. The best is yet to come.\"As Berman steps into the next era of NWSL, there are new frontiers to forge. Previously, stadiums and general infrastructure were once bridges considered too long to cross. Now, they are a near-non-issue as owners embrace a mixed approach of building new stadiums and training facilities, or sharing existing arenas, while new state-of-the-art quarters are being built. \nWhile there is increasing pressure and debate over the NWSL salary cap, an inflection point for some as a make-or-break for star players to stay or flee the league, the board of governors has made it clear they trust Berman to move the league forward and further. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Revenge may not be one of the top factors you consider when constructing your Fantasy football strategy, but perhaps it should be for your Week 12 Fantasy football picks. Several players will see former employers, such as Christian McCaffrey versus Carolina, Aaron Jones versus Green Bay and Baker Mayfield versus the Rams. While McCaffrey is a must-start for Week 12 Fantasy football lineups, the others may get a bit of a boost in the eyes of some managers. That's especially considering the injuries to players like Aaron Rodgers and Josh Jacobs that could have ramifications, as well as the loss of Michael Penix Jr. (knee) for the season, which will reshape the Atlanta offense.There's also Ja'Marr Chase's suspension and a Drake London injury that's affecting the Week 12 Fantasy football WR rankings. Add in that there's twice as many teams on a bye this week than last, and there's lots to keep track of when sorting out what Fantasy football advice to follow. Before making your Week 12 Fantasy football picks, be sure to check out the Week 12 Fantasy football rankings from the proven computer model at SportsLine. Bet on every NFL Week 12 game at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your $5 initial wager wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:When it comes to ranking players, SportsLine's model beat human experts in Fantasy football for the past several seasons, especially when there were big differences in ranking.

Prescott beat up on the lowly Raiders this past Monday, but he won't get nearly as easy a matchup this week versus Philadelphia. Only one team has allowed fewer passing touchdowns than the Eagles this year, as Philly has kept six straight starting QBs to one passing touchdown or fewer. Prescott had his worst game of the year versus Philly in Week 1, with his fewest touchdowns (zero) and fewest passing yards (188). With that taken into account, the Cowboys quarterback sits outside the top 15 in quarterback rankings and is one to fade for Week 12 Fantasy football lineups.Another curveball: The model is high on Jaguars wideout Parker Washington, who sits outside the top 40 receivers in both standard and PPR leagues. Washington has become nearly an every-down player for the Jags with recent injuries to Travis Hunter and Brian Thomas Jr. The third-year wideout's had at least 62 scrimmage yards or a touchdown in three of his last four games. The Jags face Arizona on Sunday, and the Cards have allowed six different wideouts to have at least 54 yards or a touchdown over the last three weeks. The model has Washington as a top 20 wideout in the Week 12 Fantasy football rankings, even slotting him ahead of Justin Jefferson.

    "body": "\nLast week was a good one for the lookahead column as we got way ahead on multiple line moves, taking the Saints as 3.5-point underdogs against the Panthers and the Bills as 2.5-point favorites against the Texans. Both moves were somewhat dependent on injury news, with Michael Penix Jr now out and C.J. Stroud not returning as anticipated. Still, the results of last Sunday's action would've had both lines moving in our direction regardless. We also picked up some value taking Colts +4.5 before the Chiefs' loss to the Broncos.We also talked last week about 1.5 being a number primed to move based on Sunday action, and all three 1.5s did just that. The Bears moved up to -3 early in the week and is now settling at -2.5. The Raiders moved to -3 as well and then past that key number as news emerged that Shedeur Sanders would start for the Browns. The Jaguars-Cardinals game saw the favorite flip altogether, with the Jaguars going from +1.5 to -3 in most spots as of Thursday.There's only one 1.5 to watch out for this week, with the Falcons laying 1.5 on the road against the Jets. Both teams have elevated their QB2 to starter, with Atlanta replacing the injured Penix with Kirk Cousins and New York replacing the ineffective Justin Fields with Tyrod Taylor. The performance of those new starters against the Saints and Ravens, respectively, will go a long way toward determining which way the lookahead line moves in the Week 13 matchup.What can we predict this week? Let's take a look at the consensus Week 13 lookahead lines and then share our best bets to lock in early.Week 13 lookahead linesPackers at Lions (-3), 48.5Chiefs (-4.5) at Cowboys, 51.5Bengals at Ravens (-7.5), 51.5Bears at Eagles (-7), 44.5Falcons (-1.5) at Jets, 39.5Cardinals at Buccaneers (-6.5), 49.5Texans at Colts (-4.5), 46.5Saints at Dolphins (-4.5), 42.5Rams (-9.5) at Panthers, 45.549ers (-6.5) at Browns, 42.5Jaguars (-7) at Titans, 41.5Vikings at Seahawks (-7.5), 43.5Bills (-4.5) at Steelers, 47Raiders at Chargers (-8.5), 42.5Broncos (-6.5) at Commanders, 43.5Giants at Patriots (-7.5), 46.5Week 13 lookahead picksChiefs at Cowboys\nWe faded the Chiefs last week and picked up a point of value, and I expect we'll see something similar here. The Cowboys are +3.5 this week against the Eagles, a team that does not look as effective on offense as expected. That sums up the Chiefs in their last few games. If they don't light up the scoreboard against the Colts, I could see this dropping to 3.5. If the Colts are able to win the game, we might get it even lower.Bears at Eagles\nSpeaking of the Eagles, a disappointing offensive effort against Dallas without Lane Johnson will have people wonder why they should be laying so many points against a Bears team that is expected to be 8-3 after this week as they're favorites against the Steelers. The reason the lookahead line is so high is that the Bears haven't really won convincingly while building their first-place record despite a soft schedule, but if the Eagles seem like they'll have trouble scoring more than 20 most weeks, it shouldn't matter.Texans at Colts\nRounding things out in our look at this weeks Colts-Chiefs game, we could see considerable movement on this spread depending on whether Indy rises to the challenge. If the Colts go in and beat the Chiefs, proving the market has been underselling them as a team near the bottom of the top 10 rather than the top, this line could get to 6 pretty quickly,, even with C.J. Stroud potentially returning. If the Chiefs' defense shuts down what's been the best offense in the league in yards per play, it'll be easy to see the Texans doing the same and keeping this around a 3-point game. I'm more on the site of the market underrating the Colts, and I think we'll end up wishing we could get -3.5 in this matchup by this time next week if we don't do it now.Other notes: The 49ers are laying 6.5 in Cleveland and won't have played by the time the lines reopen. That number has the potential to move if Shedeur Sanders plays well in a relatively soft matchup this week. If the Browns go out and beat the Raiders with an offense that looks better than what's been on the field the entire season, it'll be easy to see Sanders keeping the starting job and having success against the current iteration of the San Francisco defense. But if Sanders flops, this could reopen at 7 as we wait to hear about Dillon Gabriel's status ... The Raiders looked awful against the Cowboys but are laying 4 points this week against the Browns, and if they turn things around and look like a competitive team in that game, it'll easy to see their line against the Chargers the following week dropping from 8.5. Remember that the Chargers tend to have a home-field disadvantage when playing the former L.A. team, and the state of their offensive line taking on Maxx Crosby certainly isn't going to help their case for covering a big spread.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Cesc Fabregas is widely considered as one of the most interesting young managers around Europe and it's easy to imagine that many of the top European clubs will try to hire him in the near future, probably next summer. After his full first Serie A season in charge of Como, where they ended up in the top 10 of the table, Inter and Bayer Leverkusen tried to sign the Spanish manager but both failed. Surprising? Not really. Not because they didn't offer what he wanted but mainly because he knows that at Como, he can make all the steps necessary and has all the resources and trust he needs. The top teams can wait. \n\nThe former Arsenal, Barcelona and Chelsea midfielder sat down with Kate Scott and was the latest guest of \"Kickin' It\" on Paramount+, where he talked about both his player and coaching experiences and also what he hopes can achieve in the future. Fabregas talked extensively about how the game has changed in this new era.  \n\"I understand that you need to take care of the players a hundred percent. There is much more information now than what we used to have before, but you need to live the moment and you don't know what will happen in three years,\" he said. \"If I can play this year 70 games, which I did quite a few seasons between national teams and again because before there was also the League Cup, the FA Cup, the Champions League, the Euros, the World Cup, everything existed there. Nowadays, it's true that maybe the calendar is a bit more congested with the Nations League and a couple of more games here, but there were a lot of games. So yes, it's changed. Maybe the intensity of the game is faster now, but before it was more physical.\"\n        \n            \n                How Como 1907 are chasing Wrexham-esque Hollywood dreams with glamour and goals\n                \n                    Francesco Porzio                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nOn Messi and Arsenal Speaking about his time at Barcelona, where he grew up as a player before moving to Arsenal, he also met a young Lionel Messi, who just moved from Argentina.\n\"I remember the first day he came because he sat right next to me and they told us that there is this boy coming from Argentina making a trial and he'll be with us for a couple of weeks,\" he said. \"But yeah, he had immediate impact because he didn't speak a word, he didn't, he was super shy, he sat down. We were a good group, I have to say in that generation. And after that, on the pitch, he started talking straight away, very, very fast. I always tell that story that there was one against one situations, and at the beginning of the training, and I was quite good defending one against one at that age, after, when I grew up, not so much, but when he was facing me, you see a small boy, he was really, really tiny.\"Also, talking about his Arsenal days, Fabregas reflected on when he decided to go back to the Premier League but joined Chelsea instead of his beloved team.\"At the beginning, when I was going to leave, I thought, I'm going back to Arsenal. That was my thought and what I expected at that moment. They had a week, Arsene Wenger had a week to respond, to take the option or not, they never came back. They stayed quiet. So there was only one way and one choice, and that was Chelsea and Jose Mourinho because he told me everything that I needed to hear at that moment of my career and he made it happen. The fans were outstanding with me, outstanding. I couldn't be more grateful. We had a great feeling connection straight away. But of course I'm very competitive and when I was the captain of Arsenal, you dislike all the London clubs.\"\nHow Fabregas ended up at ComoAfter playing at the highest levels of elite soccer with Arsenal, Barcelona, Chelsea and AS Monaco, during the 2022-23 season, Fabregas moved to Italy and played for Como in his last season before retiring from professional soccer. When he arrived at Como, he also became a shareholder of the club alongside former Arsenal and Barcelona teammate Thierry Henry.\"I have to say I'm so grateful and lucky because a guy of his experience and me as a young manager, we have to remember he was my coach at Monaco for two, three weeks, but he brought me to the club, so he was already my coach and I look up to him as a player, also as a coach for what he's done also. And I'm very lucky because when he comes, he's come to the training room, let's say four or five times, and of course, he speaks to players. He's never really given a speech, which one day maybe I would like him to, but for me, he's constantly texting me before and after every game.\"After he retired, Fabregas immediately became the manager of the Under-23 Como team, a few months before taking the job of the first team, without taking any kind of hesitation.\n\"I didn't finish my career the way I dreamed of. Let's kind of put it this way, and I was just so hungry. I felt so convinced that I wanted to be a coach. I had everything in my head. I was already preparing for the last four years before I retired. I knew exactly what I wanted to do and when you feel so excited about something and you get an opportunity straight away after you finish your career, I took it not knowing the demands of the job, you can have kind of expectations\". In his first season at Como as caretaker manager, he earned Serie A promotion, and in his first full season in charge, he ended up in 10th place in the standings with the newly promoted team, showing not only a great level of soccer but also developed some young players such as Real Madrid loanee Nico Paz. Despite only coaching Como for less than two seasons, Fabregas immediately attracted interest from multiple clubs like German side Bayer Leverkusen that saw in Fabregas the perfect replacement of Xabi Alonso, who joined Real Madrid in the summer 2025 while Inter also tried to appoint him after the farewell of Simone Inzaghi in the summer but then decided to sign Cristian Chivu after both the manager and especially the club turned down every kind of approach.Como are owned by the Djarum Group, an Indonesian conglomerate led by brothers Robert Budi Hartono and Michael Bambang Hartono, who bought the club back in 2019 with their London-based company, SENT Entertainment. The Hartono brothers have a combined net worth of approximately $48 billion, according to Forbes, and the club is run by Mirwan Suwarso, who represents the ownership at the club.  \nNow, the expectation is to see Como clinching European spots after an impressive summer of 2025 with their transfer business.\"When in Europe? Hopefully soon. We will give our best. I'm very prudent with my players and my words because we're very, very young. There are lots of ups and downs with young players, but we're trying to be consistent,\" he said. \"Now. We've done, let's say a third of the championship. If we do the same third that we've done now in the next two, I'm sure we will do it because we are [on pace for] 72 points. And I think with 72 points you make Europe for sure. But again, it's all up to us and we need to keep going. We need to keep believing, we need to keep working. This is only the beginning.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Is it too early for me to assume the 2026 NBA Rookie of the Year race has already been narrowed down to two players? Probably, but with the way Cooper Flagg and Kon Knueppel have been playing, it feels difficult to see another player crashing the party.     That's also not a diss to the rest of the rookie class, because there are so many guys not on this top-five list that should be mentioned. VJ Edgecombe's production hasn't risen to the levels of what we saw from him to open the season, but he's still doing a little bit of everything to make his presence on the floor a positive. Dylan Harper returned from a 10-game absence and is putting up 13 points on 46% off the bench for a Spurs team that is holding steady without Victor Wembanyama.     And that's barely the tip of the iceberg of a rookie class that will be talked about for years to come. But let's stay in the present and get into these rankings and break down the top five rookies through the first two months of the NBA season.     5. Cedric Coward, Grizzlies\nSince our last rookie check in, Coward has since been made a full-time starter, giving him more opportunity on offense. He posted a double-double in a win against the Clippers this week, where he shot efficiently from everywhere but 3-point range. In fact, since he's been made a starter, Coward's 3-point efficiency has fallen off a cliff. That's not alarming by any means, but rather shows that progress is never linear.     \nInside the arc, however, Coward is showing some veteran-level skills in knowing how to navigate through traffic to get to the rim.     You could probably put an asterisk on his dominance against the Clippers, because everyone's going off on that team as they continue to be in freefall defensively. But it's still impressive nonetheless given that despite being a rookie, Coward is able to exploit the weaknesses of a defense with relative ease this early.      4. Jeremiah Fears, Pelicans\nI said in our first batch of rankings that Fears' 3-point efficiency was starting to catch up with his confidence in taking those shots, and my point has only further been proven. He was shooting 31.7% through the first three weeks of the season, since then that's shot up to 42%. It's on relatively low volume, just 3.1 attempts per game, but if he continues to make them efficiently, teams will have to respect the shot.     \nFears is most dangerous when attacking the rim, but a consistent 3-point shot opens up more of his offensive game.     Leading up to this possession, Fears had made two 3s with Donte DiVincenzo giving him space so he could take away his ability to get to the rim. DiVincenzo adjusted to cover Fears tighter, which the rookie noticed and took advantage of in a split second.     His quick first step immediately caught DiVincenzo on his heels, giving Fears just enough room for his speed to do the rest of the work.     \n3. Derik Queen, Pelicans\nThe Pelicans have been heavily criticized for their draft night trade that sent their 2026 first-round pick to the Atlanta Hawks in exchange for Queen, who was selected 13th overall. The move looks especially bad now that the Pelicans have the worst record in the league and that pick looks to be a top-three selection. But then you watch Queen put up a triple-double the other night and that criticism shouldn't be as loud.     \n        \n            \n                Five ways the Pelicans could have handled the Derik Queen trade better\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSure, it would've been nice if the Pelicans could've gotten one of the many lauded prospects at the top of next year's draft, but between Queen and Fears, the Pelicans might've found their duo of the future already.\nHe's the first rookie in NBA history to record a 30-point triple-double with four blocks, and is also the first rookie center to record a 30-point triple-double, too. And the fact that he did this against Luke Kornet, a towering presence whose a solid paint protector in his own right, is all the more impressive. Some of the shots Queen was making were straight up circus shots, but there were other times where he was doing whatever it took to get a decent look, or just difficult shots altogether.     \nThe scoring is nice, but it's Queen's court vision that's going to earn him a very long career in this league. It's not everyday you see a center threading the needle with a perfectly placed bounce pass to a six-foot guard cutting to the rim.     2. Kon Knueppel, Hornets\nSince LaMelo Ball has returned to the lineup in mid-November, he and Knueppel have shared the floor for 208 minutes. In that time, when the two of them are on the floor together, Charlotte's offensive rating rings in at 117.7. That's 6.3 points higher than the Hornets' offensive rating as a team. It would also rank eighth in the league during that span, tying them with the first-place Detroit Pistons.     I wondered how Knueppel would adjust when Ball came back from injury, and while his return isn't resulting in Charlotte wins, the rookie has maintained consistency. He's been efficient, is still on pace to shatter the rookie 3-point record, and is proving to be an ideal complementary piece alongside Ball, and Brandon Miller too.     \nHe's taking more 3s since Ball's return, which was to be expected, but when he's given the opportunity to create for himself, he doesn't struggle in the moment. It will be interesting to see how the Hornets balance Knueppel's ascension this season, because it wouldn't be the best use of his talents if he's just relegated to a spot-up 3-point shooter. He excels in the mid-range, and has a variety of dribble moves to get to the rim. If the Hornets are focused on his development, then allowing him to shoulder more of the ball-handling responsibilities with or without Ball in the lineup.     1. Cooper Flagg, Mavericks\nAfter the Mavericks picked up a surprising win against the Houston Rockets recently, in which Flagg had 19 points, five rebounds, three assists, two steals and a block Kevin Durant spoke glowingly about the rookie.     \"Just from watching his film, he's finally figuring it out,\" Durant said. \"They're also doing a good job of taking him off the ball some and letting [Ryan] Nembhard and Brandon Williams control the game and he can just float around and be an all-around player. When you play him at the point, I feel like you're limiting his game. He's playing a well-rounded game. He can shoot the jump shot off the middy, he can shoot the 3, he can get to the rim. I love his game.\"     \nThis comes just a month after Durant said Flagg will be considered \"one of the best of all time\" when his career is over. With the way Flagg's been playing over the past month, Durant's words certainly seem to be on the right track. After an odd start to his career after the Mavericks experimented with having him run point, we're finally starting to see the version of Flagg -- the betting favorite for Rookie of the Year honors (-140 at DraftKings) -- everyone raved about going back to his high school days.     \nFlagg's efficiency is looking like it will be a major strength over his career. He's shot over 50% from the floor in seven of his last 12 games, and shot over 60% four times during that span. His 52 clutch points ranks fourth in the league this season, and he's making mid-range shots at a 46% clip, which ranks in the 84th percentile.     Flagg appears far more confident over the last month, has been more aggressive on offense and while his 3-point shot is still a work in progress, he's been practically automatic from everywhere else. He rarely forces things, always looks for the extra pass to a teammate and defensively has already become someone the Mavericks rely on to get a stop.     \nIt took a little while, but through the first two months of the season Flagg is in the pole position for Rookie of the Year.     \n            ",

    "body": "\nSportsLine NFL expert Jeff Hochman's system paid off in Week 14 with the New Orleans Saints and Las Vegas Raiders covering against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Denver Broncos, respectively. He's lined up another system for Week 15 of the 2025 NFL season and identified two spots bettors can target.NFL teams bouncing back after blowout lossesWin Rate: 53-30-5 ATS (63.9%)Sample Size: Since 2005Criteria: Teams off a 20+ point loss without restEdge: Underdogs of 9.5 or lessWhy does this work?This system works because Jo Public overreacts exorbitantly after blowout losses. A team gets destroyed 38-10, and suddenly everyone thinks they're garbage. Sports talk shows go crazy, casual bettors start fading them hard and the oddsmakers are forced to move the lines aggressively in response. But people forget these are NFL teams—they've got experienced coaches, professional players and they've been through bad games before. One blowout doesn't define them. Most of these lopsided losses are flukes, not evidence that the team suddenly fell apart.When the public panics and the lines overreact, that's your opportunity to jump on inflated spreads. But there's a limit—the line needs to stay under 10. Once it hits double digits, the system's telling you something's actually broken with that team.Week 15 qualifiersArizona Cardinals +9.5 vs. Houston Texans | Confidence: 3.5 out of 5\nThe Cardinals allowed 534 yards and 45 points to the Rams last week. The Rams are favored to get the No. 1 seed in the NFC, so this result is understandable. Arizona has struggled against NFC West opponents, losing three consecutive games by more than 40 points. The team is now 3-10 with five straight losses and 10 defeats in their last 11 games after a 2-0 start. They have been officially eliminated from postseason contention and may focus on playing spoiler in the last month of the season. Outside the division, Arizona has lost six straight games, but each defeat was by a single score. Jacoby Brissett has performed well in the fourth quarter, often securing late covers.The Texans possess the best scoring defense in the NFL, allowing just 16 points per game. In seven recent matchups, Houston has allowed only 259.6 yards per game with a 4.57 yards-per-play average. On the other side of the ball, Houston has scored more than 23 points just once in winning five straight games while going 4-1 ATS.Houston is entering Week 15 after defeating the Bills, Colts, and Chiefs in consecutive weeks. This creates an extremely vulnerable scheduling spot, particularly with injuries piling up on defense. The public and sportsbooks have overvalued Houston based on beating playoff-caliber teams, while losing sight of the fact Houston's offensive performance was pedestrian in the Week 14 win over Kansas City. C.J. Stroud went 0-for-8 to begin the second half, and the Texans only prevailed because head coach Andy Reid made inexplicable fourth-down decisions. Arizona should be more dialed in after getting embarrassed last week. Plus, the Cardinals are accustomed to playing indoors.Washington Commanders +2.5 vs. New York Giants | Confidence: 2.5 out of 5\nThis matchup features two struggling teams with a combined 5-21 record and certainly qualifies for a corner TV game at sportsbooks. Washington has lost eight consecutive games, while the Giants have dropped seven straight. Washington fits the 63.9% ATS rebound system following a significant 31-0 loss in Week 14. The market appears to have overreacted to this result, as the line has shifted from -1.5 to -2.5.Marcus Mariota leads a strong rushing attack for the Commanders, which could take advantage of the Giants' well-documented run defense issues. Mariota has demonstrated the ability to attack weak secondaries effectively. In his seven starts this season, he averages 35.7 rushing yards per game and the Giants allow the third-most rushing yards per game to quarterbacks (24.2 yards). Additionally, Mariota's ceiling rises when he can scramble, which will be essential against a Giants defense that has shown inconsistent pass rush discipline.Betting on Mariota to exceed his rushing yard average could be a valuable prop bet, especially considering the advantageous matchup against the Giants' defense. Furthermore, with the return of Terry McLaurin and Deebo Samuel Sr. to full health, Washington gains additional offensive options that may challenge the Giants' depleted secondary. This opens opportunities for player props, such as receiving yards or touchdown markets for these key players. Always look for plus money on anytime touchdown bets.The Giants are off a bye but they've been Washington's punching bag lately, losing three straight while going 0-3 ATS. Given both teams' recent performances, it is difficult to confidently support either side.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Byes are done with for the 2025 NFL season, which means you have a full complement of Week 15 Fantasy football picks to choose from as the Fantasy playoffs arrive in mayn leagues. There are, however, player injuries, which is a season-long thing to deal with when composing a Fantasy football strategy. Nonetheless, the likes of Drake Maye, Jaxson Dart, Christian McCaffrey, George Kittle and Tetairoa McMillan are back in action after being on a bye. But who should start along side them in Week 15 Fantasy football lineups?Speaking of injuries, Daniel Jones (Achilles) was one of many casualties on Sunday, as those who have been riding him all season long at quarterback are likely seeking out some Week 15 Fantasy football advice. His absence has a ripple effect, and while Jonathan Taylor remains a must-start, where do the Fantasy football projections forecast for Colts pass catchers like Michael Pittman Jr., Alec Pierce and Tyler Warren with the Colts uncertain on their quarterbacks plans and even bringing Philip Rivers in as an option?Before making your Week 15 Fantasy football picks, be sure to check out the Week 15 Fantasy football rankings from the proven computer model at SportsLine. Bet on every NFL Week 15 game at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your $5 initial wager wins:When it comes to ranking players, SportsLine's model beat human experts in Fantasy football for the past several seasons, especially when there were big differences in ranking. Over the course of a season, that could literally be the difference between winning your league or going home empty-handed.The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, including being ahead of the curve on players like A.J. Brown, Jonathan Taylor, Derrick Henry, Christian McCaffrey, Alvin Kamara and Jahmyr Gibbs. Anybody who banked on players like those could have made a run at their league title.Now, the model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, has revealed its Fantasy football rankings for Week 15 of the 2025 NFL season. Head to SportsLine now to see them. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. Top Week 15 Fantasy football picks One surprise in Week 15: The model is fading Colts tight end Tyler Warren, who ranks third at his position in both receiving yards and in Fantasy points, may not warrant a spot in Week 15 Fantasy football lineups. Warren is a by-product of Indy's passing game, which just lost Daniel Jones (Achilles) for the season, has Anthony Richardson on IR, and has third-strong rookie, Riley Leonard (knee) dealing with his own ailment, leading to the Rivers signing this week. Warren had season lows in both catches (2) and yards (15) on Sunday, with Leonard playing most of the game. Not much more is expected on Sunday versus Seattle, which has the No. 2 scoring defense and No. 6 total defense. Warren sits outside the top 15 in Fantasy football TE rankings.Another curveball: The model is high on Commanders running back Chris Rodriguez Jr., despite him being the RB50 in standard leagues and being started in just 35% of leagues this week. Rodriguez has leapfrogged Jacory Croskey-Merritt on the depth chart, as the former has more touches each of the last three weeks. He hasn't disappointed with more opportunities as Rodriguez has at least 52 scrimmage yards or a touchdown in five straight games. With the Giants' league-worst run defense on tap, as New York allows the most yards per carry and the second-most rushing yards per game, Rodriguez should find his way into your Week 15 Fantasy football lineups.

This pick could be the difference between winning big and going home with nothing. See the model's entire Week 15 Fantasy football rankings for PPR and standard leagues here.So who should you start and sit this week, and which surprising running back could lead you to victory?

    "body": "\nThe first opportunity to make a Week 15 NFL SGP comes when the Tampa Bay Buccaneers host the Atlanta Falcons on 'Thursday Night Football.' Making NFL picks on the money line could be of interest for some with their TNF SGP, but perhaps there are better options. Not only have these teams split their last 20 meetings, but their all-time series is also evenly split with 32 wins apiece. Thus, your 'Thursday Night Football' same-game parlay may want to rely on NFL player props, spread bets and total predictions.The Over has hit in four of the last five Atlanta games, while it's also hit in three of the last five Tampa games. If interested in prop bets for your NFL same-game parlay, then there are intriguing ones for the likes of Bijan Robinson, Baker Mayfield, Bucky Irving and Mike Evans, who is questionable to return after being out since Week 7. Before locking in any Falcons vs. Buccaneers picks for your 'Thursday Night Football' SGP, be sure to see the Buccaneers vs. Falcons prop predictions powered by SportsLine's Machine Learning AI.New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins, on picks like Bucky Irving going over 61.5 rushing yards.

Robinson has gone under his receptions bar in four of his last five games, averaging 3.0 receptions over this span. While he's averaging a career high in receptions per game this year, much of that was when Michael Penix Jr. was under center as Robinson has had three or fewer catches in five of the last six games started by Kirk Cousins.Additionally, Tampa has contained running backs in the passing game recently. Only one running back has had more than three receptions versus the Bucs over their last seven games, despite facing the likes of Jahmyr Gibbs and Alvin Kamara over that span. The AI model projects Robinson to have 2.8 receptions.

    "body": "\nIf ever a day deserved to be called Statement Sunday, it's the one that takes place during the Week 15 NFL schedule. There are no fewer than five matchups to make Week 15 NFL predictions on with major playoff implications for both teams. This includes divisional contests like Chiefs vs. Chargers (+5.5) and Patriots vs. Bills (-1.5). Additionally, there are captivating non-divisional games to make NFL best bets on such as Packers vs. Broncos (+2.5) and Lions vs. Rams (-6).While those games all have close NFL spreads, there are some wider ones featuring playoff contenders versus teams contending for high positions in the NFL Draft. The Week 15 NFL odds have the Eagles favored by 11 points over the Raiders, while the Jaguars are 13.5-point favorites against the Jets. All of the updated Week 15 NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Week 15 NFL picks now.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters Week 15 on a 50-35 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now, it has turned its attention to the latest Week 15 NFL odds and NFL betting lines and locked in betting picks for every NFL matchup. Head here to see every pick. Top Week 15 NFL predictionsWe can tell you one of the model's strongest Week 15 NFL picks is that the Saints (+2.5, 40.5) cover versus Carolina in a Sunday 4:25 p.m. ET kickoff in well over 60% of simulations. The Saints pulled off a road upset victory on Sunday over Tampa, covering for the second straight and for the third time in the last four games. QB Tyler Shough is providing a running element that Spencer Rattler didn't, as the rookie had 55 yards and two scores on the ground versus the Bucs. Bet the Saints to go Over 9.5 first-half points at DraftKings:\nNew Orleans also has an underrated pass defense, ranking sixth in the NFL, while Carolina already struggles on offense. The Panthers are in the bottom 10 in points scored, total yards and redzone scoring, and they have just one victory, as well as one cover, over their last five versus the Saints. The model also has the Over hitting in over 60% of simulations in an A-rated pick. See which other teams to pick here, and bet the Saints to cover at DraftKings right here:\nAnother one of its Week 15 NFL predictions: the Giants (-2.5, 46.5) cover versus the Commanders in a Sunday kickoff at 1 p.m. ET. Jayden Daniels re-injured his elbow in Sunday's shocking 31-0 loss to Minnesota, leaving the game in the third quarter and not returning. While his availability is unknown to face the Giants, Zach Ertz (ACL) is now done for the year. That's a big blow to a passing offense which is already a bottom-10 unit, while Washington ranks in the bottom-five in points allowed, yards allowed, run defense and pass defense. Both Washington (eight) and New York (seven) are on lengthy losing streaks, but the Giants have a 4-3 spread record during their streak, while the Commanders are just 1-7 ATS on theirs. New York is projected to cover in over 50% of simulations. See which other teams to pick here, and bet the Giants to cover at DraftKings:\nHow to make Week 15 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 15 NFL schedule and just revealed three underdogs projected to outright win, potentially giving you a huge payday.

    "body": "\n        The 2025 NFL season is one of the most competitive years the football world has seen in recent years. This season is the only one in the last 15 in which no team has a division lead of two games or more in Week 15 or later, per CBS Sports Research. Basically, anything can happen in almost every NFL divisional race from here, the start of Week 15, through the final four weeks of the regular season.One of the tightest division races is the NFC North, where three teams are still very much alive in the hunt for the crown. The Green Bay Packers currently sit atop the heap at 9-3-1, but the Chicago Bears (9-4) and the Detroit Lions (8-5) are right behind them. Given the clustered nature of one of the league's premier divisions, we'll zoom in on how things can twist and turn down the stretch run of the 2025 season. \n        \n            \n                Prisco's Week 15 NFL picks: Bills beat Patriots in AFC East battle, Packers knock off Broncos on road\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLet's run through the standings, tiebreakers, odds, remaining schedules and wild card picture with these three squads all within reach of a playoff spot with four weeks to go. It's worth noting this division sent the Lions, Packers and Minnesota Vikings to the postseason a year ago, so there's certainly a chance three NFC North teams could be a part of the playoffs again next month. NFC North standings, tiebreakers and odds projectionsRecordTiebreaker 1: Head-to-headTiebreaker 2: Division W-L1. Packers9-3-11-0 vs CHI ; 2-0 vs DET4-02. Bears9-40-1 vs GB; 0-1 vs DET1-33. Lions8-50-2 vs GB; 1-0 vs CHI1-3The Packers hold the top spot at the moment because they're undefeated in the NFC North. Green Bay swept the Lions with a wire-to-wire 27-13 victory in Week 1 at Lambeau Field and a 31-24 nail-biter of a win on Thanksgiving. The Packers won at home against both the Vikings (23-6 in Week 12) and the Bears (28-21 in Week 14) in their only matchups against each team thus far this season. \nIf Green Bay remains in the hunt atop the division, there's no way the Bears or Lions could end up tied with them unless they also end up with a rare tie in the next four weeks. Should the Bears and Lions end up tied for the division lead, the first tiebreaker would be head-to-head, which Detroit currently owns with a 52-21 Week 2 home win. If Chicago were to win the Week 18 matchup to force a tie atop the division standings in the event the Packers fall behind, the divisional record would be the next tiebreaker. If those figures are also equivalent, the third tiebreaker of record against common opponents would come into play. On DraftKings, the Packers are -250 to win the division for the first time since 2021, while the Bears are +310 and the Lions are +800. At the moment, CBS' Sportsline model gives the Packers a 65.1% chance to win the NFC North, while the Bears have a 24.7% chance and the Lions have a 10.3% chance.\nRemaining schedule for Packers, Bears and LionsGamePackersBearsLionsWeek 15at Broncos (11-2)Browns  (3-10)at Rams (10-3)Week 16at Bears (9-4)Packers (9-3-1)Steelers (7-6)Week 17vs Ravens (6-7)at 49ers (9-4)at Vikings (5-8)Week 18at Vikings (5-8)Lions (8-5)at Bears (9-4)All Green Bay has to secure the NFC North crown is no fewer than the same number of games the Bears win. If the Packers achieve that feat, they'll remain ahead by half a game and duck all tiebreaker scenarios. Even if the two teams did finish with the same record, the Packers would take the division with the division record tiebreaker since they already have four NFC North wins, while the max the Chicago could get up to is three. Chicago needs to win just one more game than Green Bay. To overtake their hated rivals, a win in the Week 16 rematch is a must. Beating the three-win Browns at Soldier Field shouldn't be a heavy lift, but having their final two games against fellow NFC wild card contenders like the San Francisco 49ers and the Lions doesn't make for an easy road ahead. Detroit needs to win out, which would include beating the Bears to clinch the head-to-head tiebreaker over Chicago, and they need Green Bay to go no better than .500 (2-2) down the stretch. That would put the Lions a half game ahead of the Packers at 12-5, while Green Bay would be at 11-5-1 in that scenario. All three teams have similarly difficult strength of schedules down the stretch. The Packers and Lions are tied for the seventh-toughest remaining strength of schedule at .596, with the Bears right behind them at .567, the ninth-hardest remaining slate. The action across the final four weeks of the season will truly prove the mettle of the division just in time for the postseason. Can any NFC North team earn a wild card spot?NFC wild card standingsW-L5. Seahawks10-36. 49ers9-47. Bears9-48. Lions8-59. Panthers7-610. Cowboys6-6-111. Vikings5-8There is certainly a world where the Packers, Lions and Bears could make the postseason with the second and third-place finishers occupying the final two wild card spots behind the runner-up in the NFC West between the currently 10-3 Los Rams and Seahawks. With the Lions playing at the Rams in Week 15 and the Bears traveling to San Francisco to face the 49ers in Week 17, a path to the postseason is very much at the fingertips of both Detroit and Chicago. The Packers are the NFC North favorite at 65.1% but they also hold a near-inevitable 93.7% chance to make the postseason as either the division winner or a wild card, according to SportsLine. The Bears have a 70% shot to reach the playoffs despite their division numbers sitting at just 24.7%, which means they are a favorite to earn one of the NFC's three wild card bids. The Lions have just above a coin flip's chance, 52%, to return to the postseason, according to SportsLine.  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NFC West has been the best division in the NFL this year, and with just four weeks to play in the regular season, it's starting to look like it's also going to give us the best division race down the stretch. Heading into Week 15, the Los Angeles Rams and Seattle Seahawks are tied at the top of the division with 10-3 records, and then you have the San Francisco 49ers, who are lurking just behind them at 9-4. The Rams and Seahawks have been so dominant this year that they're currently the top-two favorites to win Super Bowl LX. The Rams are the overall favorite at +370 while the Seahawks are second at +650, per DraftKings Sportsbook. Every other team is +700 or worse. With three of the best teams in the NFL getting ready to duke it out for a division title over the final four weeks, we thought now would be a good time to take a look at the NFC West race and how it might end up shaking out.\nWith that in mind, let's get this thing started by checking out the division standings. NFC West standings, tiebreakers, odds projectionsW-LTiebreaker 1:   Head-to-headTiebreaker 2:   Division W-L      1. Rams10-31-1 vs. 49ers; 1-0 vs. Seahawks3-12. Seahawks10-30-1 vs. 49ers; 0-1 vs. Rams2-23. 49ers9-41-1 vs. Rams; 1-0 vs. Seahawks4-1Although the Rams and Seahawks have the same record, the Rams are actually in first place right now because they have a head-to-head tiebreaker over the Seahawks.Over at DraftKings, the Rams are the favorite to win the division at -145 (bet $145 to win $100). Then there's the Seahawks at +185 and the 49ers at +700. According to our friends at SportsLine, the Rams have a 43.6% chance of winning the division while the Seahawks are right behind them at 40.3%. As for the 49ers, once again, they're the long shot with their chances sitting at just 16.1%. \nSo who's going to win NFC West? Let's break down each team's easiest path to winning the division. \n        \n            \n                Predicting the entire 2025 NFL playoff bracket and Super Bowl winner as we enter Week 15\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nRemaining schedule and how each team can win the divisionGameRamsSeahawks49ersWeek 15Lions (8-5)Colts (8-5)Titans (2-11)Week 16at Seahawks (10-3)Rams (10-3)at Colts (8-5)Week 17at Falcons (4-9)at Panthers (7-6)Bears (9-4)Week 18Cardinals (3-10)at 49ers (9-4)Seahawks (10-3)One reason the Rams are viewed as the favorites is because they have the easiest remaining strength of schedule out of these three teams at .481. On the other hand, the Seahawks have the second most difficult remaining strength of schedule of any team in the NFL at .654. As you can see, the Seahawks have to play four games against teams who are all currently over .500.  Now that we know each team's schedule, let's check out their path to the division title.How the 49ers can win the NFC West:49ers win outRams go 3-1, but that one loss has to be to the Seahawks or CardinalsIf these two things happen, the 49ers would finish 13-4 and win the NFC West over a 13-4 Rams team based on the division record tiebreaker. If the Seahawks also finish 13-4 in this scenario, the 49ers would have swept them, so they'd win any tiebreaker with Seattle. At 7-to-1 odds to win the NFC West, the 49ers feel like a steal. For the Seahawks and Rams, winning the division is a little simpler: All they have to do is win out. Of course, both teams can't win out since the Rams and Seahawks will face each other on Thursday night in Week 16. If the Seahawks beat the Rams in that game, there's a good chance the division won't be decided until Seattle and San Francisco play each other in Week 18. \n        \n            \n                Super Bowl Survivor: Which two teams are left standing in one of the NFL's most unpredictable seasons?\n                \n                    Douglas Clawson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWill the NFC West earn two wild card bids?NFC wild card standingsW-L5. Seahawks10-36. 49ers9-47. Bears9-48. Lions8-59. Panthers7-610. Cowboys6-6-111. Vikings5-8The answer to this question is almost certainly going to be yes. If the Seahawks go 2-2 down the stretch, that will put them at 12-5, meaning the Lions would have to go 4-0 to catch them.As for the 49ers, they'll be favored in their next two games (against the Titans and Colts), and if they win those, that will put them at 11 wins. The Niners also play the Bears in Week 17, and if they win that game, that would all but guarantee that they're in since they would hold the head-to-head tiebreaker over Chicago. Our friends over at SportsLine simulated the rest of the season, and they view all three teams as virtual locks to get in the postseason. The Seahawks have a 97.9% chance of making the playoffs, while the Rams are 94.5% and the 49ers aren't too far behind at 89.4%.The last time the NFC West sent three teams to the playoffs came back in 2021, and if we get a repeat of that season, the Rams would probably love it, since they won the Super Bowl that year.  \n            ",

Last week we debated the best player who would get traded at the Winter Meetings. This week we're going to tackle one of the offseason's hottest trade candidates.Will the Diamondbacks trade Ketel Marte? Where will he end up?R.J. Anderson: I  don't have a great read on the situation, but I'm leaning toward yes  for a few reasons. Foremost, I think there's enough interest that  someone will step up and make them an offer they have trouble resisting.  Beyond the market forces, it's generally not a good sign when clubhouse  irritation is being leaked about one of the club's best players during a  playoff push -- a lot of the times this stuff is dealt with internally  or otherwise kept quiet. I'm not taking sides here on who was right or  wrong, just noting that the public knowing about this entire spat is a  red flag. There's also the reality that, from a baseball-only  perspective, Marte is already 32 and likely nearing a decline despite  being under contract for another five years (at rates well below his  market price, mind you). Doesn't mean he's about to crater or that the  D-backs should eject as soon as possible. But, when you add all of that  together, I think there's probably a better than 50% chance of something  happening before Opening Day. As for landing spot, I'll say the Blue Jays.Matt Snyder: I'll go with a Mariners reunion. One might recall that  the Mariners traded Marte to the Diamondbacks prior to the 2017 season.  Back then, he was just a youngster with high upside. Now he's a star. The  Mariners are coming off their closest opportunity to make the World  Series in franchise history and just bringing back Josh Naylor isn't  quite the splash they need this offseason. Marte fills the void at  second base left by Jorge Polanco hitting free agency and he fits nicely  in the batting order in several different spots (he could hit anywhere  from 1-5 for them, really).Dayn Perry: I'll be the one to say he doesn't get traded and winds up  back in Arizona, at least to start the 2026 season. I understand the  D-backs' desire to add more pitching, but an aspiring contender should  tread carefully when it comes to parting with a player of Marte's  caliber, and that's the case even if soft decline sets in. As well, the  reported availability of Brendan Donovan and Brandon Lowe on the trade  market perhaps dampens what the D-backs can expect in return for an  All-Star like Marte. I'll say they revisit discussions leading up the  trade deadline but hang onto him for now.\nMike Axisa: There's too much smoke right now for me to think Marte stays in Arizona. This is their last chance to trade him without his permission before his 10-and-5 full no-trade protection kicks in 10 days into next season (that's 10 years in the league, including the last five with the same team), and I think they'll work to get it done. I'm going to go off the board a bit and say the Reds, who have the pitching the D-backs seem to want in return, as well as what seems like an appetite to spend after reaching the postseason. Marte's reasonably priced (up to $102.5 million over the next six years), which works well for Cincinnati. I think Marte gets traded and I'll go with the Reds as his next team.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 NBA Cup quarterfinals came to a close on Wednesday with the Western Conference half of the bracket. As expected, the Oklahoma City Thunder made easy work of the Phoenix Suns to improve to 24-1 on the season and tie the best 25-game start in league history. Later on, the San Antonio Spurs put together a brilliant offensive display to upset the Los Angeles Lakers. On the Eastern Conference side of the bracket on Tuesday, the Orlando Magic came back from a 15-0 deficit to defeat their in-state rivals, the Miami Heat, while the surging New York Knicks used a dominant second quarter to race past the Toronto Raptors and win for the eighth time in their last nine games. The semifinals of the NBA Cup are set for Saturday in Las Vegas:Knicks vs. Magic, 5:30 p.m. ET -- Amazon PrimeSpurs vs. Thunder, 9 p.m. ET -- Amazon PrimeBefore the Cup action resumes, here's a look at the winners and losers from the quarterfinals:Loser: Anyone in the Thunder's wayThe Thunder are the defending champs and were 23-1 entering Wednesday night, so there was no confusion about their status as the league's best team. Still, their destruction of the Suns had to be demoralizing for the other 29 teams, and particularly those hoping to challenge for the title. \nThis was the first time the Thunder have had anything at stake in a single game since Game 7 of the Finals, and if this is what it looks like when they actually step on the gas, good luck to everyone else. Sure, the Suns were shorthanded, but the gap between the Thunder and the next best teams looks bigger than ever. The Thunder have now won a franchise record 16 games in a row, and their 24-1 start is tied for the best in NBA history with the 2015-16 Golden State Warriors. Their 49-point win on Wednesday was the biggest margin of victory in the league this season and was their fifth win already by 30-plus points (the record in a season is 10). If you want more proof of their dominance, check out this stat, courtesy of Ben Golliver:\nWinner: Stephon CastleStephon Castle was the near-unanimous Rookie of the Year last season, but was dismissed in some corners as simply the best of a bunch of bad options. But while his class may not go down as an all-timer, Castle has proven this season that he was no charity case. His effort on Wednesday night to lead the Spurs to the semifinals was his latest piece of evidence. Castle, who only recently returned from a hip flexor injury that sidelined him for over three weeks, finished with a season-high 30 points, 10 rebounds and six assists on 10-of-14 shooting from the field, including 3 of 6 from 3-point range. He was all over the place on both sides of the ball, and joined Tim Duncan and Victor Wembanyama as the only Spurs players to have a 30/10/5 game at age 21 or younger. Wembanyama and No. 2 overall pick Dylan Harper rightfully receive so much attention, but Castle's performance against the Lakers was a strong reminder that he's a big piece of the Spurs' future, too. \nLoser: The Lakers' defenseThe Lakers entered Wednesday night's quarterfinal with the 21st-ranked defense in the league (116.2 defensive rating). That number is only going to look worse after their no-show against the Spurs. The Spurs poured in 39 points in the first quarter and never looked back. They crossed the 30-point mark in each of the first three quarters -- they \"only\" managed 28 in the fourth -- and put up 132 points for their fourth-highest scoring game of the season. San Antonio shot 50% from the field, made 17 3-pointers, got to the line for 36 free throws (they made 29) and only turned the ball over 10 times. All night long, the Spurs were able to do whatever they wanted. There was little resistance from the Lakers' perimeter players on their drives, and even less when they got out in transition. They scored 27 fastbreak points, including two late in the first half on a notable possession where Harrison Barnes got an uncontested dunk because the Lakers stopped playing for some reason. \nThe Lakers have an incredible offense, and as long as Luka Dončić, LeBron James and Austin Reaves are all healthy, they're going to win a lot of games. But to ultimately compete for the Western Conference crown, they'll have to figure out a way to get stops. It's worth noting that they're the only team in the bottom-third of the league in defensive rating with a winning record. Winner: The KnicksThe Knicks have largely flown under the radar this season -- in part because they got off to a lackluster start, but largely because there have been other more interesting stories. Over the last few weeks, however, the Knicks have started to round into form. \n        \n            \n                Knicks, Jalen Brunson issue reminder to East as they surge into NBA Cup semifinals\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThey've won eight of their last nine games to improve to 17-7 and move within two games of the Detroit Pistons for the top spot in the Eastern Conference. Tuesday's big win over the Raptors was a reminder of why they're currently the Eastern Conference favorites (+270, per Caesars) despite being in second place in the standings. \nThe semifinals in Las Vegas will be a chance for the Knicks to take center stage for perhaps the first time all season and ensure they're overlooked no more. And, while the NBA Cup is obviously nowhere near as important as the Finals, the competition offers a franchise that has been starved for success an opportunity to lift a trophy. Winner: Desmond BaneThe Magic gave up Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Cole Anthony, a 2025 first-round pick (Yang Hansen), three unprotected first-round picks (2026, 2028, 2030) and a 2029 first-round pick swap (top-two protected) to acquire Desmond Bane from the Memphis Grizzlies during the offseason. That was a massive price to pay, especially for a non-superstar, and when Bane and the Magic got off to a rough start this season, Grizzlies fans were doing victory laps. As it turned out, Bane just needed some time to acclimate to a new city and teammates. \nBane's been very good for a few weeks now, but it had to feel good for him to have a big night in a showcase game in front of a national audience. No better way to remind everyone that you're a borderline All-Star than by pouring in 37 points (14 of 24 from the field, including 6 of 9 from 3-point range) and chipping in six rebounds and five assists in a comeback win.  During the Magic's 8-3 hot streak, Bane is averaging a team-high 22.2 points on 46/38.7/96 shooting splits, 4.6 rebounds and 4.6 assists. Loser: Grayson AllenGrayson Allen got off to an incredible start for the Suns this season, but has struggled since returning from a quad injury that sidelined him for just over two weeks. He did not get back on track Wednesday. \nNot only did Allen finish with just 10 points on 3 of 9 from the field in the Suns' 49-point loss (the worst defeat in team history), he was ejected in the third quarter after chucking Chet Holmgren to the ground. \nThe play was reviewed and upgraded to a Flagrant 2, which, to be fair to Allen, seemed a bit harsh. Even so, it was a completely unnecessary moment that will only further tarnish Allen's reputation. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Oklahoma City Thunder and pre-Kevin Durant Golden State Warriors share a number of similarities.The superstar point guard who won his first MVP, and first title, two years after his first All-Star selection.The shooting-guard wingman who became the second All-Star (Klay Thompson and Jalen Williams).The dominant defense built on like-sized switchers and the pressure they provide.The hidden gem in Draymond Green (drafted in second round) and Lu Dort (undrafted).The defensive-ace acquisition (Andre Iguodala and Alex Caruso).The first-time head coach.Those Warriors felt the cynicism surrounding their first championship. They heard the critics pointing to the opponent injury luck they'd enjoyed along their postseason path. Nobody called it outright luck. But to say that team was universally accepted as the best in the league would be a lie. People pointed to the 2-1 hole in which those Warriors found themselves against Memphis in the second round, and the fact that Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love combined to play one game in the Finals, as evidence that they weren't actually as dominant as they'd been made out to be. The Warriors heard it all, and used it as fuel to bombard the league the following season to the tune of a 24-1 start en route to an NBA-record 73 wins in the 2015-16 season.It's the same deal for these Thunder, who had their dominance questioned after needing seven games to squeak past the Nuggets in the second round before being on the right side of Tyrese Haliburton's blown Achilles in Game 7 of the Finals. Were the Thunder actually the best team? \nYes, they were. And like those Warriors, they have used the stage of this season to drive that point home. No championship hangover. No mercy. Their most victim was the Suns, who took a 49-point thrashing (Phoenix's most-lopsided loss in team history) in the NBA Cup quarterfinals Wednesday night, which ran OKC's record to ...24-1. These Thunder have virtually mirrored those Warriors at every turn, and it begs the question: Is Golden State's 73-win record in jeopardy? Yes, it is. Personally, I'd go so far as to say I'll be surprised if the Thunder don't break the record. The odds don't agree. Caesars currently has the over 73.5 wins mark for these Thunder at +325, and the under at -500, which makes sense as we're talking about a win total that has never been reached. Things happen. Players get hurt. Schedule losses show up. \nI get all that, and I'm still saying I'll be surprised if Oklahoma City doesn't win 74 games. This is a team that entered Wednesday demolishing its opponents by 15.9 points per 100 possessions, which would shatter the current NBA record. And that was before they beat Phoenix by 49. Injuries are the obvious X-factor, but ask yourself who's going to get hurt that's going to upend Oklahoma City's attack? Jalen Williams is the second-best player on the team, and they started the season 18-1 with him in street clothes. Even the one loss never should've happened as it required the Thunder blowing a 22-point lead to the Blazers. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is the MVP of the league for crying out loud, and on paper the Thunder don't even need him to bury you alive. Seriously, the Thunder are carving opponents up by 16.2 points per 100 possessions when SGA's not on the floor, per CTG, which is a number no logical mind can wrap itself around. \nSpeaking of insane numbers, the Thunder have now outscored their opponents by 439 points this season. That's the highest point differential in history through 25 games by an almost laughable margin. TEAMSEASONPOINT DIFFERENTIALOklahoma City Thunder2025-26+439Boston Celtics1967-68+380Golden State Warriors2017-18+375Milwaukee Bucks1972-73+367New York Knicks1970-71+358Last season the Thunder outscored opponents by 12.9 points per 100 possessions, which was the best net rating in history. This season they are annihilating their own record with an utterly absurd +17.5 through 25 games. As noted in Michael Pina's recent piece for The Ringer, Oklahoma City entered play on Wednesday having played 18% of its minutes this season with at least a 20-point lead. On Wednesday the Thunder had their first 20-point lead less than a minute into the second quarter and they played the entire second half leading by at least 26. So often are the Thunder blowing the doors off their opponents that Gilgeous-Alexander has only had to play the fourth quarter in 12 of his 24 games so far, and yet he still leads the league in total clutch points. There's no hole to potentially exploit here. No single player, not even SGA, dominates the ball, so OKC isn't susceptible to its superstar having an off night, if he ever plans on actually having one of those. He's scored at least 30 points in 19 of his 24 games this year, and dating back to last regular season SGA has scored at least 20 points in 97 straight games. The guy is averaging nearly a point per minute. That's Wilt territory (and Giannis, who's actually averaging 0.99 points per minute this season, per NBA.com). \nTo have arguably the best offensive player in the world paired with the best defense in history is like putting prime Aaron Rodgers on the 2000 Ravens. That's what we're talking about with the Thunder, who have so many \"next guys up\" than it literally doesn't matter who goes down. At the very least, even if everyone goes cold on the same night, the defense -- which is currently operating at a rating some 12 points above the league average, by far the largest gap in league history, per PBP Stats -- is on every night. To call this defense a machine, even a monster, is an understatement. Words don't exist for this kind of pressure. And by the way, that idea I floated about the whole offense going cold on the same night is basically just a theory posited for the sake of argument. It's not going to happen. OKC ranks third in field-goal percentage. Fifth in 3-point percentage. They create more turnovers than any defense in the league but basically never cough it up themselves (only the Celtics have a lower offensive turnover rate). Look back at those early Warriors teams. You could at least have the hope of catching them on a sloppy turnover night, or perhaps you could beat them with size. It almost never happened because they would shoot their way out of every mistake. but this Thunder team? They hardly make mistakes in the first place. Think about how many things have to go wrong for them to lose even one game. For starters, the opponent has to play brilliantly. Then, on top of that, the Thunder have to shoot poorly, which they almost never do, or have SGA put up an average night, which he never does and which also doesn't even matter because they murder you even when he isn't playing at all, or have the defense play poorly (hilarious), or have about five players hurt at the same time because two or three doesn't even dent their depth. And that's just to lose one game. The Thunder can lose eight in total, seven more, and still break Golden State's 73-win record. Now ask yourself, how likely is it that all this stuff happens seven more times? No, you can't account for the unforeseeable. A ball bouncing the wrong way. A back-to-back letdown. A big blown lead. It's going to happen. It already did once against the Blazers. But that was like lightning striking, and lightning doesn't strike seven times. I think this record is going down. \n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Logan Bowles\n            \n            \n    \n        Michael Wilson was amazing in Week 11 against San Francisco with Marvin Harrison Jr. (appendix) out. I'm expecting Wilson to do well again in Week 12 against Jacksonville with Harrison still sidelined, and Wilson is one of my favorite DFS plays for this scoring period.Wilson will be popular in Week 12, especially since he's a great price at $4,800 on DraftKings and $6,300 on FanDuel. And he has a favorable matchup against the Jaguars, who have allowed nine receivers to score at least 12 PPR points this season.Against the 49ers, Wilson had 15 catches for 185 yards on 18 targets, but I obviously wouldn't expect that level of production again, especially since Jacoby Brissett attempted 57 passes against San Francisco. That said, Brissett has attempted at least 44 passes in three of five starts in place of Kyler Murray (foot), and Harrison averaged 11 targets per game in two outings before getting injured.This should be another productive game for Wilson in Week 12. And I'm excited to use him in my DFS lineups on DraftKings and FanDuel.\nFor more of my DFS plays for Week 12, click on this link to SportsLine.

    "body": "\n        Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce is in the final year of his contract, and many speculate the 2025 season will be his last. Now 36-years-old, Kelce understands he will have a decision to make in the near future, but he won't keep his franchise guessing whether he plans to retire, or continue playing in 2026. \"I want to give the Chiefs a good opportunity, whether I come back or not -- or whether they want me back or not,\" Kelce said, via ESPN. \"I'd like to make that decision before they've got to get draft picks and free agency opens to fill the roster appropriately.\"All that will be at the end of the season. I won't be thinking about it until then.\"While he's in the midst of his 13th NFL season, Kelce is still productive. Through 10 games played, he leads the Chiefs with 50 catches for 631 yards and four touchdowns. Regarded as one of the best tight ends in NFL history, Kelce currently ranks third on the all-time receiving list at his position with 12,782 yards, trailing only Jason Witten (13,046 yards) and Chiefs legend Tony Gonzalez (15,127). However, Kelce is Kansas City's all-time leader in receptions (1,054), receiving yards and touchdowns (81). \nA three-time Super Bowl champion, Kelce has established himself as the best postseason tight end in NFL history. He is the NFL's all-time postseason leader in receptions (178), and just the third player to lead three Super Bowl champions in receiving yards, joining Hall of Fame wide receivers Jerry Rice and Michael Irvin. Kelce and Patrick Mahomes have connected for 18 touchdowns in the playoffs, which are the most scores by a duo in NFL postseason history -- three more than Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski.Prior to Super Bowl LIX eight months ago, it was reported that Kelce's decision to retire or play in 2025 could hinge on the outcome of their showdown with the Philadelphia Eagles, despite him telling reporters on Super Bowl Opening Night that he hoped to be playing football for years to come. The Chiefs were blown out by Jalen Hurts and Co. 40-22. Less than a month after the Super Bowl LIX loss, Kelce confirmed he was returning for his 13th season. He even said on his \"New Heights\" podcast that it was the Super Bowl loss that motivated him to keep playing.\n\"It was probably the biggest factor,\" Kelce said of his decision to return, via NFL.com. \"I mean, it's a pretty cool way to go out, but I just think I would still have this love for the game. ... I think I would have thought about it more if we would've won.\"While the Chiefs sit at 5-5 entering Week 12, they still have Super Bowl aspirations. Kelce is focused on winning football games right now, instead of his future or a farewell tour. \"I think the biggest thing is that I f-----g love playing the game of football,\" Kelce said this offseason. \"I love playing. I still feel like I can play it at a high level and possibly at a higher level than I did last year. I don't think it was my best outing. I think I let my guys down in a lot more moments than I helped them, especially if you look at my track record and how I've been in years past. I want to give it a good run. I got a bad taste in my mouth in how I ended last year and how well I was playing and how accountable I was to the people around me.\n\"I love so many people in Kansas City, both in that facility, in the community, and it's home for me now. I don't want to leave that life yet. I put in a lot of hard work and I put in a lot of focus into being the best that I can for K.C. Last year it didn't end well for us. I just feel like there's a responsibility in me to play out the contract that I initially signed, to give Kansas City and the Chiefs organization everything that I've got, and that's what I'm going to do, man.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Mikel Arteta has insisted that Arsenal can weather the storm of \"weeks\" without their defensive leader Gabriel as injuries threaten to derail the Gunners ahead of a pivotal week.Gabriel injured his thigh in Brazil's 2-0 win over Senegal on Saturday and is due for further scans on Wednesday as Arsenal look to ascertain a clearer timescale on the recovery of their defensive leader. Initial fears pegged the 27 year old as facing up to two months on the sidelines but for the time being Arteta remains reluctant to offer further clarity.\"He's going to be out for weeks,\" said Arteta. \"We need to have another scan and we'll have the timeline much clearer than we have at the moment. It's clearly a blow, it's our leader in our backline. It's never a positive thing to lose him. The good thing is we have very good options and people have to stand up now and do the job.\"To complicate matters further Riccardo Calafiori remains a doubt for Sunday's north London derby having missed training during the international break. The Italian national team sent Calafiori back to Arsenal after initial tests on his thigh injury and Arteta revealed that the 23-year-old, an ever present in his Premier League XIs this season, had been playing through pain.\n\"He's been carrying a few things and we had to bring him back. He hasn't trained yet. Tomorrow we have another training session, let's see how he is.\"The injuries to the Arsenal backline are all the more frustratingly timed for Arteta given that they come just as the headaches in the frontline appeared to be easing. The league leaders reached the international break without six attacking options and their manager was customarily circumspect when asked which of Gabriel Martinelli, Gabriel Jesus, Kai Havertz, Martin Odegaard, Viktor Gyokeres and Noni Madueke might be available for the visit of Tottenham. \"I can [tell you] but I'm not going to do it,\" he joked.His circumspection would suggest that at least some of those will be available. Martinelli is understood to have trained during the break and there has been speculation that both Odegaard and Madueke could be involved in some capacity. Arteta indicated he was as optimistic about the sextet as he had been in a relatively buoyant press conference before the international break and the 1-1 draw with Sunderland. However his insistence on keeping cards close to his chest will at least keep Thomas Frank guessing until an hour and a quarter before kickoff on Sunday.\n\"It's the final stage,\" he said, \"and now is when there is contact around them, when they have to be pushed into very unpredictable things that they haven't done. I think they are going to be with us soon, I don't know if Sunday is going to be too soon.\"\n        \n            \n                Ballon d'Or Power Rankings: Defenders don't usually win it, but Arsenal's Gabriel is making his case\n                \n                    James Benge                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHowever many forwards return it would be fair to wonder if Arteta would trade them all for Gabriel's fitness. The Brazilian is the rock on which the best defense in Europe is built, Arsenal having conceded five goals in 17 games across all competitions, and that is to say nothing of the devastation he routinely causes from set pieces. It would not be an exaggeration to suggest that Gabriel might have a serious chance of winning some of the sport's biggest individual prizes if he were to be fit throughout the season, a prospect that is looking increasingly slim. No matter how long he is out, Gabriel will be missed. \"Every player brings their specific qualities and Gabriel is his leadership, his presence and the love that he has to defend and to transmit as well his body language to other players. We have to do it, and we have to spread that.\"\nIt is something Arteta believes his squad can do. \"People will step up, we've done it in the past many, many times. Unfortunately, we played last year the biggest and most problematic part of the season without him as well, and the team was able to cope with that.\"In that Arteta is referring to the run to the end of last season in which Arsenal had to do without Gabriel -- and a host of other key players. The hamstring injury that seemed to be a hammer blow to their Champions League prospects, coming as it did on the eve of their quarterfinal against Real Madrid, did not necessarily destroy the Gunners, who lost only three of their final 12 matches.Then again as they staggered to the finish line they conceded 13 goals and allow a little over an expected goal per game. Before Gabriel went down it was 39 against in 46, 0.88 xG against per match. Jakub Kiwior stepped in impressively, raising his standing among supporters, but he was no Gabriel. Piero Hincapie might be one of the best back up center backs in the league but Gabriel is one of the best center backs in the world. Calafiori too, another option to fill in next to William Saliba, is a great talent. He just isn't Gabriel. No one is.\nViewing informationDate: Sunday, Nov. 23 | Time: 11:30 a.m. ETLocation: Emirates Stadium -- LondonLive stream: PeacockPredicted lineupsArsenal XI: David Raya; Jurrien Timber, William Saliba, Piero Hincapie, Riccardo Calafiori; Martin Zubimendi, Declan Rice; Bukayo Saka, Eberechi Eze, Leandro Trossard; Mikel MerinoTottenham XI: Guglielmo Vicario; Pedro Porro, Cristian Romero, Micky van de Ven, Destiny Udogie; Rodrigo Bentancur, Joao Palhinha, Pape Matar Sarr; Mohamed Kudus, Richarlison, Wilson Odobert\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Major League Baseball's offseason is in full swing and that means the rumor mill is, too. Below, CBS Sports has gathered all of Friday's most notable news, moves, and murmurs in one convenient spot.Here's what's cooking across the league.Yankees in touch with star outfielders The Yankees have been in contact with free-agent outfielders Kyle Tucker and Cody Bellinger, among others, general manager Brian Cashman confirmed.\"We'd love to have Bellinger come back,\" Cashman told the media Thursday. \"Talked to [agent Scott] Boras yesterday about Belli and other free agents of his. Talked to Casey Close about his free agents; he's got Kyle Tucker, amongst others. That's the nature of the beast in the winter.\"\n        \n            \n                Kyle Tucker free agency: Pros and cons, contract prediction, landing spots and more for star outfielder\n                \n                    Matt Snyder                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTucker is the best free agent available, no matter the position. The Yankees are likely to face competition from the Blue Jays, Phillies, Dodgers, and other clubs if they give him serious pursuit. Meanwhile, Bellinger is a familiar face, having spent last season with the Yankees following an offseason trade with the Cubs. CBS Sports recently ranked him sixth in this winter's class.\nThe Yankees have already reunited with one outfielder this week, when Trent Grisham accepted the qualifying offer to return to New York on a one-year pact worth just more than $22 million.Cardinals' Donovan remains popular targetCardinals utility player Brendan Donovan remains one of the most popular targets on the trade market, according to MLB Network's Jon Morosi. Several teams have already been publicly connected to Donovan this offseason, including the Astros and the Royals. Morosi adds the Yankees and the Mets to that collection.\nDonovan, 28, has two seasons of team control remaining. To date, he's a career .282/.361/.411 (117 OPS+) hitter with 40 home runs and 11.1 Wins Above Replacement to his credit. Donovan's defensive versatility (he started more than five games apiece at three positions) makes him a fit for most contenders in some form or fashion.\nThe Cardinals, in their first offseason under the control of Chaim Bloom, figure to be in for a winter of retooling. Twins add catcher in trade with OriolesThe Twins have bolstered their catching depth by acquiring veteran Alex Jackson from the Orioles in exchange for minor-league infielder Payton Eeles, the teams announced Friday.Jackson, 30 come December, is a veteran of parts of six big-league seasons. He could serve as the backup to Ryan Jeffers or perhaps in a timeshare if the Twins decide to deal Jeffers as part of their ongoing rebuild.\nJackson hit .220/.290/.473 (111 OPS+) last season with five home runs in 36 games.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Lane Kiffin Watch continues. After meeting with Kiffin on Friday, Ole Miss athletic director Keith Carter said the focus is on next Friday's Egg Bowl vs. rival Mississippi State and that \"an announcement on Coach Kiffin's future is expected the Saturday following the game.\"That statement comes in the aftermath of what has been a wild week in Oxford, Mississippi. After a plane carrying multiple Kiffin family members, including ex-wife Layla Kiffin, traveled to Baton Rouge on Monday, the discussion of whether Kiffin will stay or go cranked into overdrive. There was also a less-publicized Kiffin family trip to Gainesville, Florida, the day before as the Gators continue to make their play for Kiffin's services, sources confirmed to CBS Sports. While it is unlikely there will be definitive clarity before next Saturday, numerous sources with knowledge of the situation have told CBS Sports in the last 24 hours that they believe the momentum has shifted in LSU's favor to land the talented head coach. To be clear, that does not mean it's a done deal. Throughout the week, Kiffin has seemingly gone back and forth by the day while trying to make a decision. For example, there were multiple days this week that sources felt like it was trending toward Kiffin taking the job at LSU only for it to then come across the next day like he was giving real thought to staying at Ole Miss. \"It's like following a high school recruiting process,\" one source said.Sources have indicated throughout the week that they believe Florida is running third in the Kiffin sweepstakes. \n\n        \n            \n                Ole Miss wants clarity from Lane Kiffin. He's not in a position to give it. What's next?\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAccording to those who know him well, Kiffin can struggle when making big decisions, which is why so many are hesitant to say definitively what he will do until he signs the contract. As many have pointed out in recent days, it felt like a foregone conclusion at one point that Kiffin was going to take the Auburn job back in 2022 before he ultimately decided to stay in Oxford. No. 6 Ole Miss (10-1) closes its regular season with the Egg Bowl against Mississippi State with a win potentially giving the Rebels a first-round home game in the College Football Playoff. CBS Sports reported earlier this week that sources said if Ole Miss was convinced Kiffin was not staying long-term in Oxford, it would not let him coach in the playoff. Ole Miss hoped to get clarity this week on Kiffin's decision, prompting Friday's meeting between Carter, Kiffin and Ole Miss chancellor Glenn Boyce. \"Coach Kiffin and I have had many pointed and positive conversations regarding his future at Ole Miss, including meeting today with Chancellor Boyce,\" Carter said. \"While we discuss next steps, we know we cannot lose sight of what is most important -- our sixth-ranked team that is poised to finish the regular season in historic fashion.\"\nCarter's statement made clear Kiffin will be coaching the Egg Bowl -- but now attention turns to whether that will be his last as Ole Miss' coach. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        There's a bit of symmetry with the Week 12 NFL odds as three games have a spread of a field goal or less, while three contests also have a double-digit NFL line. Amongst the former are Steelers vs. Bears (-2.5), with Aaron Rodgers' (wrist) availability in question, and Jaguars vs. Cardinals (+3), while double-digit favorites to place Week 12 NFL bets on are Seattle (-13) versus Tennessee and Detroit (-11.5) versus the Giants. However, it's a team that isn't even over .500 which is the biggest favorite on the Week 12 NFL schedule. Baltimore has won four straight to get back into the playoff picture, and they'll host the Jets on Sunday. The Ravens are at -13.5 to use in Week 12 NFL picks, and while double-digit favorites are 10-1 straight up this season, they are just 6-5 ATS. One of those games whose spread falls in between the aforementioned extremes is Chiefs vs. Colts, which has another .500 team in Kansas City as 3.5-point favorites over an 8-2 Colts squad coming off a bye. All of the updated Week 12 NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Week 12 NFL picks now. LIMITED TIME: Use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1 JOIN NOW. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your initial $5 bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

Arizona is 6-1 ATS versus AFC opponents since 2024, which is the second-best spread record for any team in non-conference matchups. Meanwhile, the Jags are just 1-4 ATS this year outside of Jacksonville, and the takeaways that fueled their early success have nearly dried up. The Jaguars averaged 3.3 takeaways over their first four games but have averaged just 0.8 turnovers forced per game over their last six. Thus, extra offensive possessions for Arizona allow it to take advantage of the Jags' 26th-ranked passing defense, as Jacoby Brissett is projected to have more yards and touchdowns than Trevor Lawrence. With that, the Cardinals cover in over 50% of simulations. See which other teams to pick here.\nAnother one of its Week 12 NFL predictions: the Ravens (-13.5, 44.5) cover versus the Jets in well over 50% of simulations. New York is coming off a mini-bye, having played last Thursday, but there's no spread advantage with this rest edge. The Jets are 3-11-1 ATS over their last 15 games when they have a rest advantage over their opponent. Their Sunday opponent, Baltimore, has recently looked like the team most expected them to be all season as the Ravens have allowed just 14.8 points over their last five games. That includes a pair of games versus top-10 scoring offenses, but the team doesn't have to worry about seeing that with the Jets, who rank dead last in passing offense and 25th in scoring. Baltimore covers with points to spare, and the model also says the Over hits in over 70% of simulations. See which other teams to pick here.\nHow to make Week 12 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 12 NFL schedule and just revealed five teams projected to win by double-digits, potentially giving you a huge payday by playing the alternate lines. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine.So what Week 12 NFL picks can you make with confidence, and which five teams should you lock in now?

In New York, the show is scheduled to air after the Jets-Ravens game, at approximately 5 p.m., but viewers are being advised to check their local listings for the exact air time in their region. The show will take a look back on the top moments from the year, along with a preview of the Mubadala Abu Dhabi Sail Grand Prix Season 2025 Grand Final that will be held Nov 29-30.The aim of the Rolex SailGP Championship has been to redefine the sport of sailing by bringing the action closer to the shore so that fans can experience the thrill of seeing the massive 50-foot foiling catamarans whiz by at speeds exceeding 60 miles per hour. \nThe show will be the sailing fan's ultimate guide to the season thus far and will spotlight the world's best athletes across four continents. Some footage shown will include the U.S. SailGP Team making the podium in Dubai, ROCKWOOL Denmark breaking the SailGP speed record, and crashes and collapses on the water. Interviews with the U.S. SailGP team and commentary from all event winners will also be part of the broadcast.The Grand Final event, which will consist of two days of 12-boat fleet races, is scheduled for next weekend. Points earned during the preliminary races will determine the three teams to advance to final race, a single, winner-take-all showdown -- and the $2 million prize, the largest in the sport, that will go to the champions. \nThe top three national teams on the leaderboard are Emirates representing Great Britain, the Black Foils of New Zealand and the BONDS Flying Roos out of Australia. However, do not discount last year's winners, Spain's Los Gallos. \n            \n    ",

DeMarco will remain on the bench for the Warriors for the time being, and it has not yet been determined when he will make the switch to working solely with the Liberty.DeMarco, who has been with the Warriors since 2012, helped the franchise win four NBA titles and is regarded as a defensive specialist. He has also served as the head coach for the Bahamas men's national basketball team since 2019. Liberty star Sabrina Ionescu reached out to Warriors star Steph Curry during this process to get his thoughts on DeMarco, per ESPN.The Liberty won the first title in franchise history in 2024, and got off to a 9-0 start last season. Injuries eventually derailed their campaign, however, and they were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Mercury. Days after their Game 3 defeat, the Liberty announced that Brondello would not return as coach. During Brondello's four seasons in charge, the Liberty went 107-53, won a franchise-record 32 games in both 2023 and 2024, never missed the playoffs and made two Finals appearances. In addition to their 2024 WNBA championship, Brondello also captured the Commissioner's Cup title in 2023.\nDespite all of Brondello's success, general manager Jonathan Kolb and the Liberty's brain trust felt it was necessary to go in a different direction to get the most out of their championship window. \"Coming out of this season and really seeing an influx of change on many teams, it made the decision timeline tangible and one that we can be actionable on,\" Kolb said during his exit interview about the decision to move on from Brondello. \"You can stand still or you can embrace change and move forward. My commitment is to keep pushing the New York Liberty to new heights. We believe that embracing this change will bring a freshness and an energy to our group.\"\nThe Liberty only have two players under contract for 2026 -- Leonie Fiebich and Nyara Sabally -- and like every team in the league face a fascinating offseason. Breanna Stewart, Ionescu and Jonquel Jones have all expressed a desire to return, but it remains to be seen how free agency will work after a new collective bargaining agreement is ratified. In addition to trying to re-sign their Big Three, the Liberty will have big decisions to make about Natasha Cloud and Emma Meesseman. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\nTwo star-studded teams in the Washington Spirit and Gotham FC will meet in San Jose for the NWSL Championship, a competitive match likely in store as each side chases their second league title.The pair took contrasting roads to the Championship, the No. 2 seed Spirit advancing as the favorites in their matchups while Gotham played spoiler as the No. 8 seed, eliminating the runaway NWSL Shield winners in the Kansas City Current and last year's champions Orlando Pride. To describe this as a David vs. Goliath-type game would be a misnomer, though, Gotham have been inconsistent, but they won the Championship just two years ago and boast an MVP nominee in Esther Gonzalez.While Gonzalez and new Gotham recruit Jaedyn Shaw headline Juan Carlos Amoros' team, the attention will also be squarely on the Spirit's Trinity Rodman. She returned from an MCL sprain in a very brief cameo in the Spirit's 2-0 win over the Portland Thorns last week, her exact status unclear. If there is any game she could play, though, it just might be one where there's a trophy on the line – in what could be her final NWSL game, her contract expiring upon the conclusion of the season.How to watch the NWSL Championship, oddsDate: Saturday, Nov. 2 | Time: 7=8 p.m. ETLocation: PayPal Park -- San Jose, Calif.Odds: Washington Spirit +130; Draw +210; Gotham FC +190Projected lineupsWashington Spirit: Aubrey Kingsbury, Rosemonde Kouassi, Esme Morgan, Rebeca Bernal, Tara McKeown, Kate Weisner, Hal Hershfelt, Leicy Santos, Croix Bethune, Trinity Rodman, Gift MondayRodman's availability will be the big talking point on Saturday, in large part because the Spirit are a different team when she is on the field. They have won nine of the 16 games she has played this season and posted a +15 goal differential along the way, while the number of wins dwindles to four in 11 games she did not play with a goal differential of -3. If Rodman cannot start, though, Italy international Sofia Cantore could fill in after starting against the Thorns while the Spirit's attacking plans will run through Gift Monday regardless, the Nigerian scoring 10 goals so far this season.Gotham FC: Ann-Katrin Berger, Bruninha, Emily Sonnett, Jess Carter, Lily Reale, Jaelin Howell, Jaedyn Shaw, Rose Lavelle, Gabi Portillo, Midge Purce, Esther GonzalezGotham's defensive stability has kept them afloat in a year of inconsistent attacking output, though not from a lack of effort on Gonzalez's part. The Spain international has 13 goals this season, just two behind MVp winner Temwa Chawinga, and Shaw's scintillating form has helped Gotham make up some of the attacking deficit left behind after Yazmeen Ryan and Lynn Biyendolo's departures in the offseason. Rose Lavelle is also in strong form, connecting expertly with international teammate Shaw to revive Gotham's offense at just the right time.PredictionThere is motivation and narrative to support either team's argument, setting up for a closely-contested Championship game – and perhaps a spicy one, if last year's semifinal in which the Spirit ousted Gotham on penalty kicks is anything to go by. This one will likely come down to a moment of brilliance from a star and there is no one who is more in-form than Shaw. She has two goals and an assist during Gotham's postseason run, a contribution on each and every goal they have scored in the playoffs so far. She has helped them pull off two upsets in a row, a third not exactly out of reach for a roster just as stacked as the one they will face. Pick: Washington Spirit 1, Gotham FC 2 (after extra time)\n            ",

Though that is around $300,000 less than he was making at Penn State, it does keep him among the top 20 highest-paid coaches in college football.Franklin's compensation is also staggered. He's set to make $500,000 in base annual salary with the rest of the money coming from incentives. Franklin will make more money each year of the deal, with the contract's value set to peak at $12.75 million in 2030. Notably, Virginia Tech is also increasing Franklin's salary pool to $15.5 million, which means that he'll have plenty of money to assemble his inaugural coaching staff with the Hokies. Here's a look at the other incentives baked into Franklin's first contract: \nHe can make up to $250,000 in bonuses for 12-win seasons. He'll be awarded $150,000 for any coach of the year awards. Franklin will receive bonuses for ACC Championship Game and College Football Playoff appearances with an $800,000 for winning a national title. Penn State and Franklin also agreed to a reduced buyout in light of his hiring at Virginia Tech. Instead of paying Franklin $49 million over the course of six years, Penn State is on the hook for just $9 million of Franklin's previous agreement with the school. Penn State fired Franklin in October amid a 3-3 start to the 2025 season. He departed the Nittany Lions with a 104-45 overall record, three top-10 finishes in the AP Top 25 poll, one Big Ten title (2016) and an appearance in the 2024 College Football Playoff. \nFranklin is set to replace Brent Pry, his former defensive coordinator at Penn State. Pry never won more than seven games with the Hokies, who were 0-3 at the time of his departure in September.  \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Basketball in the Bahamas for the Baha Mar wraps this week with a matchup straight from the dreams of paradise as No. 1 Purdue and No. 15 Texas Tech meet late on CBS Sports Network for the event's championship game. The matchup features two preseason top-10 teams who have each been tested this week in the Bahamas, and who each have responded with resilience to march into Friday's finale. No. 1 Purdue punched its championship game ticket after stiff-arming a tougher-than-expected push from Memphis on Thursday. Memphis led by as many as nine points early before the Boilermakers tracked them down and raced out for what turned out to be a cushy 80-71 victory. \n        \n            \n                College basketball rankings: Purdue survives Memphis to set up clash vs. Texas Tech for Baha Mar Championship\n                \n                    Gary Parrish                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nNo. 15 Texas Tech defeated Wake Forest in its own battle Thursday after it traded blows with Wake Forest for a full 40 minutes. The game featured nine lead changes and finished with an 84-83 Red Raiders victory.  Here is everything you need to know about Friday's showdown.    Where to watch Purdue vs. Texas Tech  live    Date: Friday, Nov. 21 | Time: 9:30 p.m. ET     Location: Baha Mar Convention Center -- Nassau, Bahamas   \tTV: CBS Sports Network [Channel finder]  \tLive stream: CBSSports.com | Mobile: CBS Sports App   Purdue vs. Texas Tech: Need to know  Offensive fireworks: Purdue owns the No. 1 offense in adjusted efficiency metrics at KenPom.com this season, while Texas Tech -- No. 12 in adjusted efficiency -- is no slouch itself on that end. That combo along with both team's inconsistent early defensive sequences could give us a shootout. Vegas seems to think that may be the case, too: The over/under on the game is 153.5. \nStars aplenty: Texas Tech forward JT Toppin, the reigning Big 12 Player of the Year, leads all Big 12 players this season in rebounds per game (10.0) and is averaging 23.5 points per game to boot. Purdue guard Braden Smith is averaging 9.0 assists per game -- second in college basketball -- while teammate Trey Kaufman-Renn is averaging 16.0 points and 13.7 boards per game. There's enough star power here to deliver us a dandy tonight. Good chance there are at least three All-Americans -- and maybe more! -- taking place in tonight's action.  3-point strength: Texas Tech's scoring this season has been boosted significantly by a reliance on its 3-point shot. Of all its points scored, 41.2% of its offense can be attributed to 3-pointers, per KenPom data -- which is 23rd-most in college basketball. That strength may match up well vs. a Purdue team that is 147th in 3-point percentage allowed this season. Tech's propensity to fill it up from deep and to do it a consistently high level will be among the bigger storylines that decides the outcome.     Purdue vs. Texas Tech prediction, pick  \nOdds via Caesars Sportsbook Texas Tech keeps this game close but Purdue pulls out a close one. That's my official prediction. Tech has the size, skill and physicality to match the Boilermakers, and their offense can be good enough not just to keep it close, but to pull off the upset. I think the play here for me would be to take the points on the underdog in what on paper is a pretty even matchup. Pick: Texas Tech +3.5 \nWho will win and cover in every college basketball game? Visit SportsLine to get picks from the model that simulates each game 10,000 times and is up more than $1,200 for $100 players on its top-rated spread picks the past six years.   \n            ",

The mandate banning athletes and staff from betting remains in place after the board rejected a rule change permitting pro sports gambling on Friday.Last month, the NCAA Division I Board voted to delay a legislative change that would permit college athletes and athletic department staff to gamble on professional sports. The rule change, originally intended to go into effect on Nov. 1, was delayed to Nov. 22 after pushback from SEC commissioner Greg Sankey and other prominent voices. Each Division I school was given 30 days to vote to rescind the proposal, since it was adopted by less than 75% of the cabinet. More than two-thirds voted to stop the rule change, crossing the threshold needed one day before the 30-day period expired. The amendment would have only affected betting on pro sports. Betting on college games and sharing information with bettors would have remained prohibited regardless of the outcome. The decision follows a high-profile federal investigation into sports betting and illegal gambling. On Oct. 23, Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups, Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and former NBA player Damon Jones were among more than 30 people arrested by the FBI as part of two extensive federal grand jury investigations.\nOn Friday, an NCAA investigation found that former Temple guard Hysier Miller placed bets on and against his own team. Two weeks ago, the NCAA revoked eligibility from six men's basketball players over allegations of sports betting. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        A big fight card goes down on Saturday, with four world title bouts anchoring the action from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. In the headliner, WBC light heavyweight champion David Benavidez will put his title on the line against Anthony Yarde.The other three championship bouts set for the event are WBO welterweight champion Brian Norman Jr. against Devin Haney, WBC and WBO junior bantamweight champion Jesse \"Bam\" Rodriguez battling WBA champ Fernando Martinez in a three-belt unification bout, and Abdullah Mason facing Sam Noakes for the vacant WBO lightweight championship.There are plenty of intriguing storylines running through the card, so let's take a look at the odds and break down all four world title fights.David Benavidez vs. Anthony Yarde fight card, oddsOdds via FanDuel SportsbookDavid Benavidez (c) -1200 vs. Anthony Yarde +680, WBC light heavyweight titleBrian Norman Jr. (c) -112 vs. Devin Haney -112, WBO welterweight titleJesse \"Bam\" Rodriguez (c) -1200 vs. Fernando Martinez (c) +670, unified junior bantamweight titleAbdullah Mason -430 vs. Sam Noakes +300, vacant WBO lightweight titleAbdullah Mason vs. Sam NoakesThe 21-year-old Mason (19-0, 17 KO) has been a hot prospect since turning professional in 2021. He has been on the standard prospect track of facing lower-level talent before slowly moving up to more difficult challenges. In his most recent fight, Mason faced the most dangerous test of his career, taking on Jeremia Nakathila. Nakathila was unable to continue after the fourth round as Mason cruised again.\nIn Noakes (17-0, 15 KO), Mason is facing another up-and-comer, though one seven years his senior. Noakes' career has been very similar to Mason's, with a comparable stoppage rate and journey from facing lower-level talent to a few wins over veterans such as Yvan Mendy and Ryan Walsh.Mason is someone who feels as though he has the makings of a special fighter, while Noakes feels like he tops out at being a very good one. That said, neither fighter has faced much resistance in their careers; in their four combined fights that went to decision, they lost a total of two rounds. This has the potential to be a very good fight that teaches plenty about both fighters. Pick: Abdullah Mason via UD (+220)Jesse \"Bam\" Rodriguez vs. Fernando MartinezRodriguez (22-0, 15 KO) had a breakthrough 2022, when he accepted a fight with Carlos Cuadras for the WBC super flyweight championship on one week's notice. Jumping up a weight class on short notice, Rodriguez won the title and defended it twice against Srisaket Sor Rungvisai and Israel Gonzalez before returning to flyweight. At flyweight, Rodriguez won two titles before returning to super flyweight, where he has continued piling up impressive victories while becoming a unified champion once again -- and grabbing the No. 5 spot in the CBS Sports pound-for-pound rankings.\nMartinez (18-0, 9 KO) is a fighter who thrives on aggression. He won the IBF title by beating Jerwin Ancajas in 2022. After winning the belt, Martinez successfully defended in a rematch before beating Jade Bornea and Kazuto Ioka (twice). The fight has been targeted for a while, and now the two best fighters at 115 pounds are set to mix it up.Rodriguez is a brilliant tactical fighter who unleashes combinations as well as anyone in the game. Martinez will have to figure out a way for his aggression to nullify Rodriguez's footwork and force the issue in exchanges. That's a big ask, though. Regardless, this has all the makings of one of the best fights of the year. Pick: Jesse \"Bam\" Rodriguez via UD (+290)Brian Norman Jr. vs. Devin HaneyHaney (32-0, 15 KO) comes into the fight as the bigger name. As the former undisputed lightweight champion, Haney has been in some huge fights in his career. As important as undisputed title fights against George Kambosos Jr. and Vasiliy Lomachenko were, the fight most people remember for Haney is the thumping he received from Ryan Garcia in April 2024. Haney was dropped by Garcia three times in a fight that came as Garcia appeared to be spiraling in a mental health crisis. Garcia, who also missed weight, failed drug tests, leading to a no-contest. By that technicality, Haney is still undefeated, but he looked very gunshy against Jose Ramirez in a terrible fight in May.\nNorman (28-0, 22 KO) packs plenty of power, and if Haney is still as worried about getting hit as he appeared to be against Ramirez, this could be a long night for him. Norman is on a career best run over his past three fights, winning the interim WBO welterweight belt by knocking out Giovani Santillan and being promoted to full champion when Terence Crawford vacated the belt to move up in weight. As champ, Norman has knocked out Derrieck Cuevas and Jin Sasaki.Haney opened the fight as a near -145 favorite but now sits at a slight -112 underdog to Norman's -120. It's hard to erase the image of Haney repeatedly crumbling when hit by Garcia's left hooks and the almost complete inability to get out of neutral against Ramirez in one of the worst fights you'll ever see. For those reasons, it's not difficult to see Norman scoring the biggest win of his career on Saturday. Pick: Brian Norman Jr. via TKO9 (+210)David Benavidez vs. Anthony YardeBoth main event fighters have promised a shootout. Benavidez told DAZN that he's happy to meet in a fan-friendly fight.\n\"I watched his fights,\" Benavidez said. \"He likes to go forward, he likes to press the action, he likes to look for the knockout, so I'm the same way. So I think at the end of the day it's going to be both egos going at each other -- who's going to back up? It's not going to be me. It's probably not going to be him, either.  \"When we're ready to go to war the people are going to see a great war, and that's what we're here for, to give the fans what they want to see.\"Benavidez (30-0, 24 KO) is now fully established at light heavyweight, a division he moved to when it was clear Saul \"Canelo\" Alvarez was never going to meet him in the ring. Benavidez took an at times ugly win over Oleksandr Gvozdyk to win the WBC interim title and then defended that belt with a big win over fellow former super middleweight David Morrell. Now, having been promoted to full champion, Benavidez looks to make his first defense against Yarde.Yarde (27-3, 24 KO) has twice challenged for light heavyweight world titles, losing to Sergey Kovalev in 2019 and Artur Beterbiev in 2023. In his losses to Kovalev and Lyndon Arthur, Yarde picked up a reputation as someone who was missing the ability to dig deep and a willingness to walk through fire when things got difficult. While Yarde was stopped by Beterbiev in the eighth round of their fight, he shook some of those labels by returning fire and digging deep to give Beterbiev a very difficult fight.\nBenavidez is the better fighter heading into this one, but his power has yet to fully translate to 175 pounds. The Yarde who showed up against Beterbiev could pull off a massive upset. That result does feel unlikely, though. Pick: David Benavidez via UD (+185)\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Arman Tsarukyan nearly jeopardized his UFC Fight Night main event with Dan Hooker in Doha, Qatar. During Friday's ceremonial weigh-ins, Tsarukyan struck Hooker with a head butt before UFC personnel intervened. Tsarukyan and Hooker, both of whom made weight for this weekend's main event, faced off for the cameras on Friday. Tsarukyan lunged over UFC matchmaker Mick Maynard's arm, striking Hooker with a head butt during their staredown. Both men appeared to be fine after the altercation, with neither sporting cuts or significant visible damage. \nTsarukyan is currently ranked No. 1 in the UFC's official lightweight rankings and is on the cusp of a title shot. A win over Hooker should net him a lightweight title shot. Tsarukyan threatened to derail the fight had either party been injured, and could've risked penalization from the Qatar Mixed Martial Arts Committee, the regulatory body overseeing Saturday's event.Tsarukyan already appeared to be in hot water with the promotion. He was scheduled to fight Islam Makhachev for the UFC lightweight title in January. However, he pulled out of UFC 311 on 24 hours' notice after suffering a back injury. UFC CEO Dana White, in response to Tsarukyan's withdrawal, said that Tsarukyan would need to earn another title shot. After weighing in as a back-up for Ilia Topuria vs. Charles Oliveira at UFC 317 got him halfway there, this fight with Hooker should get him over the finish line. \nThis isn't the first time Tsarukyan has gotten physical outside of the Octagon, either. In 2023, Tsarukyan grabbed UFC fighter Bobby Green by the throat in a verbal altercation turned physical. Last year, the Nevada State Athletic Commission suspended Tsarukyan for nine months after he punched a fan during his walkout at UFC 300.\n            \n    ",

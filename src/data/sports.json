    "body": "\n        And then there were two. Arizona and Miami (Ohio) are the final two undefeated teams in college basketball after No. 3 Michigan rallied late to survive No. 5 Nebraska's upset bid with a 75-72 victory Tuesday in Ann Arbor. Michigan erased a seven-point hole with eight minutes left in regulation to improve to 19-1 and, at 9-1 in the Big Ten, join Michigan State and the Cornhuskers atop the conference standings .The Huskers (20-1, 9-1) lost their perfect record, but won plenty of respect, showing championship-level mettle in their toughest test of the season without star big man Rienk Mast (illness) and stud sixth man Braden Frager (ankle injury). Even with two of its best four players sidelined, Nebraska gave Michigan all it could handle and then some with a barrage of treys in the first half. The Huskers dropped 50 on Michigan's vaunted defense in the first 20 minutes alone, but they ran out of gas down the stretch. Nebraska didn't score a single point for the final 3:21 of regulation.\n        \n            \n                Trotter's Trends: Charles Bediako makes Alabama SEC's most dangerous team; All-Defense picks; scary mid-majors\n                \n                    Isaac Trotter                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBoth Michigan and Nebraska came into the game as No. 1 seeds and will remain on the top line after their only regular-season meeting.Home losses are killers for Big Ten Championship hopes, and Michigan was on life support until it got a spark from some unlikely sources. Senior forward Will Tschetter changed the tenor of the game with his attention to detail defensively and constant energy. Tschetter finished with seven points, didn't miss a shot and Michigan outscored Nebraska by eight points in his 15 minutes of playing time. Freshman Trey McKenney hopped off the bench and was terrific, pouring in 11 points, including a go-ahead, big-boy bucket in the final minute.\nWithout key contributions from McKenney and Tschetter, Nebraska very well could have notched one of the most impressive road wins of the season. \nUltimately, Michigan used its patented brawn to finally put the Huskers away for good. Michigan had six enormous offensive rebounds in the second half to stem the tide and stay alive. Morez Johnson Jr. erupted for 17 points and 12 rebounds. His frontcourt mate, Aday Mara, chipped in 10 points and seven boards. \nPryce Sandfort was outstanding for the Huskers, yet again, chipping in 20 points. Jamarques Lawrence hit some big-time treys in the first half on his way to 20 points. Former walk-on Sam Hoiberg (13 points, seven rebounds, five assists and four steals) continued his stellar breakout season.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Darian Mensah has committed to Miami, according to CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz and Chris Hummer, finalizing one of the most consequential quarterback moves of the 2026 college football transfer portal cycle and bringing a turbulent, weeks-long legal saga to a close. The former Duke star, who helped lead the Blue Devils to the ACC Championship this past season, is set to arrive in Coral Gables, Florida as the centerpiece of Miami's plan to keep its national title window open after finishing as the runner-up in the College Football Playoff.Mensah's commitment follows a negotiated settlement between Mensah and Duke that cleared the legal barriers preventing him from enrolling at another school, ending a dispute that had briefly pulled the transfer portal into the courtroom.He ranks as the No. 18 overall player and the No. 6 quarterback in Cooper Petagna's 247Sports transfer portal rankings, reflecting both his production and positional value in a thin quarterback market.After transferring from Tulane, Mensah threw for 3,973 yards and 34 touchdowns in his lone season at Duke, finishing second nationally in both categories while throwing just six interceptions. Before that, he emerged as a rising star at Tulane where he threw for 2,723 yards, 22 touchdowns and six interceptions while leading the Green Wave to a 9-4 season, establishing himself as one of the most productive young quarterbacks in the country before making the jump to the Power Four in 2025.\nFor Miami, the timing and the stakes are clear. The Hurricanes' rise has been built on elite quarterback play, fueled by veteran transfers who stabilized the position and accelerated the program's return to national relevance. Cam Ward, the eventual No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, and Carson Beck were both high-reward additions who helped push Miami into championship contention.Mensah now becomes the next link in that chain.How Miami positioned itself for MensahThe path to this commitment was anything but conventional. Mensah entered the transfer portal just ahead of the window closure before Duke sought to block his departure through a temporary restraining order tied to the terms of his NIL contract. Court filings, emergency motions and a fast-moving legal calendar followed, creating uncertainty over whether the top player in the portal would be able to enroll anywhere at all.Once the two sides settled outside of court, the market moved quickly, with Miami positioned as the clear frontrunner from the outset.\nThe Hurricanes' pursuit of Mensah did not begin with his portal entry, though. Miami spent the 2026 transfer cycle operating with urgency at quarterback, driven by both roster reality and championship expectations.That urgency sharpened when Alabama quarterback Ty Simpson officially remained in the 2026 NFL Draft, removing one of Miami's primary contingency plans from the board. By that point, the Hurricanes had already missed on several other portal options. Arizona State transfer Sam Leavitt committed to LSU after visiting Miami. Dylan Raiola signed with Oregon. USC transfer Husan Longstreet, widely viewed as the best available quarterback in the portal at the time, also landed at LSU.As the window narrowed, Miami expanded its search beyond the portal itself, exploring quarterbacks who had not yet entered the database.\nThat context helps explain why Mensah's decision to inform Duke of his intent to enter the portal just hours before the 11:59 p.m. ET deadline on Jan. 16 immediately reshaped Miami's offseason strategy.The legal fight that followed briefly froze the process. Duke's temporary restraining order prevented Mensah from enrolling elsewhere, introducing uncertainty into what would normally be a rapid recruitment. But even during that period, Miami remained positioned at the front of the line.Once it was resolved, the outcome moved quickly.What Mensah means for MiamiIn an era where quarterback instability can undo even the most talented rosters, Miami chose certainty over patience -- securing a proven, high-level starter rather than risking a reset with an inexperienced quarterback already in the room.\nWithout Mensah, the Hurricanes would have entered 2026 with uncertainty at the position. Luke Nickel, a four-star recruit and the No. 16 quarterback in the 2025 class, attempted just one pass this season while redshirting as a true freshman. Backup Emory Williams, who saw limited action over two seasons, has since transferred to East Carolina. Redshirt freshman Judd Anderson and incoming freshman Deron Coleman round out the depth chart, leaving Miami without a proven college starter for a roster built to remain in contention.Mensah changes that.He steps into a Miami offense that returns a deep and productive backfield led by Mark Fletcher Jr., who broke out in the CFP, supported by CharMar Brown, Girard Pringle Jr. and Jordan Lyle. The receiving corps is set for another leap despite the departures of CJ Daniels and Keelan Marion, anchored by breakout star Malachi Toney and reinforced by emerging playmakers. The potential addition of Duke transfer Cooper Barkate, Mensah's favorite target, would add yet another weapon after he caught 72 passes for 1,106 yards and seven touchdowns this season.Miami's offensive line faces questions after losing veteran anchors, but depth remains promising.\nBy securing Mensah, Miami locks in the position that has fueled its rapid rise while returning the supporting pieces necessary to compete at the highest level. The Hurricanes have fortified a roster designed to chase a national title again.Prior to Mensah's commitment to Miami, the Hurricanes were already considered one of the nation's top contenders for 2026, holding the ninth-best national championship odds (+1600) on FanDuel Sportsbook.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The legendary Bill Belichick will not be a first-ballot Hall of Famer after he fell short of the 40 out of 50 votes needed for induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. This was Belichick's first year of eligibility. Belichick will make next year's class (2027), but there is a special pantheon reserved for \"first-ballot\" inductees, in any sport, and Belichick's legacy will be forever dulled, albeit only so slightly, by not receiving that honor. It's a shocking outcome that has some calling for voter reform with the NFL world up in arms, including three-time Super Bowl MVP Patrick Mahomes and three-time Defensive Player of the Year and NFL on CBS broadcaster J.J. Watt. Belichick is one of the greatest coaches in NFL history, if not the very best. The résumé speaks for itself:\nEight Super Bowl titles (NFL-record six as head coach of the New England Patriots and two as defensive coordinator for the New York Giants)333 career wins including playoffs (second-most by a head coach behind Don Shula)31 playoff wins (most by head coach in NFL history)Belichick's body of work is the best of any coach in NFL history, and undoubtedly better than the four other head coaches since 1970 who were enshrined in Canton on the first ballot. Bill BelichickVince LombardiTom LandryChuck NollDon ShulaNFL titles65242Reg season wins30296250193328Playoff wins319201619Reg/post wins333105270209347Unlike those four head coaches, who had squeaky-clean resumes, the sticking point with Belichick (per ESPN) are the multiple scandals (Spygate and Deflategate) that he was embroiled in during his time with the Patriots. In 2007, Belichick was fined $500,000 -- the largest fine ever levied against an NFL coach to that point -- for his involvement in the Spygate scandal. The Patriots also lost a first-round pick in the 2008 NFL Draft. In 2015, the Patriots were fined $1 million after an investigation found they deflated footballs during the 2014 AFC Championship game. They also forfeited a 2016 first-round pick and 2017 fourth-round pick and quarterback Tom Brady was suspended for four games. Bill Polian, a former Bills and Colts general manager and rival of Belichick's Patriots, reportedly told voters Belichick should \"wait a year\" because of the 2007 Spygate scandal according to an anonymous voter. Polian at first appeared to deny that claim Tuesday night, telling Sports Illustrated the report was \"categorically untrue\" and that he had voted for Belichick. But in an another interview Tuesday, with ESPN's Don Van Natta Jr., who had first broken the news of Belichick's snub, Polian said he could not remember with 100% certainty if he voted for Belichick, saying he was 95% sure he did. Polian is 83-years-old. \nSince we do not yet know the final vote count, the blame of course can not be pinned solely on Polian (though it would be unfortunate if Belichick was stuck at 39 votes and it comes out that Polian did not in fact vote for him). Polian did say he voted for Patriots owner Robert Kraft, who is a Hall of Fame finalist for the first time in his 14th year of eligibility and is the sole finalist in the contributor category for the 2026 class. Were some voters just unable to square the idea of putting Kraft and Belichick on their ballots in the same year? Did their beef complicate any feelings? We do not know. Belichick and Kraft were competing with Roger Craig, Ken Anderson and L.C. Greenwood for one to three spots separate from the 15 modern-era finalists. Mike Sando, a Hall of Fame voter and NFL writer for The Athletic, says the voting system could explain the issue here.\nBesides that, we know Belichick's legacy was not helped by the breakup with Tom Brady in 2020. Brady, of course, won his seventh Super Bowl in his first season with the Buccaneers while Belichick did not win a playoff game in his final four seasons with the Patriots after Brady left. Only one of Belichick's NFL-record 31 playoff wins came without Brady. He had an 84-103 record without Brady in his career as an NFL head coach compared with 249-75 with him (including playoffs). That information might settle the debate between who was more important to the Patriots dynasty, but it should in no way factor in Belichick not getting his gold jacket on the first try. His fingerprints were all over the eight Super Bowl teams he was part of. 1986: The Giants allowed three points in their first two playoff games before beating the Broncos 39-20 in the Super Bowl. 1990: Belichick's defensive gameplan to stop the Bills 'K-Gun' offense in Super Bowl XXV is in the Hall of Fame. His coaching was also instrumental in stopping the 49ers three-peat in the 1990 NFC title game which the Giants won 15-13 with backup quarterback Jeff Hostetler. 2001: The Patriots pulled off the 2nd-largest upset in Super Bowl history (14-point underdog) and held the 'Greatest Show on Turf' to 17 points.  2003: The Patriots beat co-MVPs Steve McNair and Peyton Manning on the way to the Super Bowl. They held each of their teams (Titans and Colts) to 14 points. 2004: Belichick once again stifled Peyton Manning and the Colts with a physical game plan in a 20-3 win vs. Indianapolis before reeling off two more wins for another title, including the Super Bowl victory vs. Andy Reid and the Eagles. 2014: Malcolm Butler's goal line interception is one of the most stunning plays in NFL history and a testament to Bill Belichick's 'next man up' montra. Butler was an undrafted rookie from West Alabama, a Division II school.2016: The Patriots pulled off the largest comeback win in Super Bowl history, down 28-3 vs. the Falcons. 2018: Belichick won his eighth and final Super Bowl by holding the Rams and Sean McVay's high-powered offense to three points. The Patriots also beat Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs in the AFC title game. I'm racking my brain for other possible explanations, because how else are we supposed to reconcile this? At watering holes across America they could point to Belichick's personal life and a 4-8 season as North Carolina's head coach as further points to diminish his standing, but both would be ridiculous arguments against his Hall of Fame worthiness. Belichick has the most Super Bowl wins by a head coach in NFL history, by a margin of two.  \n                                                                    CBS Sports Research\n                                                            There's Belichick's coaching tree during the Patriots dynasty, which never bore premium fruit. Romeo Crennel, Brian Daboll, Brian Flores, Joe Judge, Eric Mangini, Jerod Mayo, Bill O'Brien and Josh McDaniels, among others, found little success as NFL head coaches. Are people holding that against him? It would ignore how the greatest head coach in college football history, Nick Saban, was the Browns' defensive coordinator from 1991-94 under Belichick. Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel played for eight seasons under Belichick. He's now one win away from a Super Bowl in his first year. Until more answers come out, we are left to lean on the explanations of a flawed voting process and voters who potentially wanted to punish Belichick for his role in the aforementioned scandals.Belichick isn't the first person to have his Pro Football Hall of Fame inducted delayed. Terrell Owens, who has the third-most receiving yards in NFL history (15,934), didn't get into the Hall of Fame until his third year of eligibility because of his reputation. That sounds even more ridiculous now than it did 10 years ago. Many worthy first-ballot coaches have also had to wait:Bill Parcells waited until his fourth year as a finalist. He was initially turned down in 2001 and 2002 due to rumors of his return to coaching (which he did from 2003-06 with the Cowboys). Former NFL MVP Lawrence Taylor said this after the news of his election. \"If Bill didn't finally get in this year, they needed to shut the Hall of Fame down. The whole thing wouldn't have meant anything without him in there.\" The same sentiment applies to Belichick. Bill Walsh elected in his fourth year of eligibility in 1993 after leading the 49ers to three Super Bowls in the 1980s and pioneering the 'West Coast Offense'. Joe Gibbs waited until his fourth year of eligibility after winning three Super Bowl with WashingtonJohn Madden waited over two decades despite holding the best record by any head coach with at least 100 games coached (.759 win percentage) in NFL history and a Super Bowl title with the Raiders. Perhaps his short tenure as a head coach and his broadcasting career were factors in the wait.And many in other sports have had to wait and may never be in. The all-time hits king (Pete Rose), the all-time home run leader (Barry Bonds) and the pitcher with the most Cy Young awards (Roger Clemens) are not in the Baseball Hall of Fame for their past deeds, which we would judge as worse than the scandals involving Belichick.  There may be precedent, there may be the various \"gates\" he found himself tangled up in, and there's a few other minor explanations that amount to the tiniest of possible footnotes. At the end of the day, it's ridiculous that we even have to have this conversation. Look at Belichick's body of work and it's impossible that isn't being inducted this year. It should be a slam dunk. It makes no sense. We guess, as Belichick would say, we're on to 2027. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 Farmers Insurance Open tees off on Thursday from Torrey Pines Golf Course in San Diego, Calif., for the third PGA Tour event of the 2026 season. The Farmers Insurance Open features a viable field, including Brooks Koepka making his high-profile PGA Tour return. Xander Schauffele is the +1400 favorite in the latest 2026 Farmers Insurance Open odds, followed by Ludvig Aberg (+1700) and Cameron Young (+1900). Koepka has +5000 odds to win. Many golf bettors will choose to play  PGA Tour prop bets when placing 2026 Farmers Insurance Open bets, and the SportsLine model has found some Farmers Insurance Open prop bets it projects value in, including backing J.J. Spaun to finish in the top 5, which has +550 odds (risk $100 to win $550). The model also likes Jason Day to defeat Keegan Bradley in a tournament matchup at -140 odds. It also finds value in Si Woo Kim, who finished T6 last week, to finish in the top 10 at +290 odds. Before locking in any 2026 Farmers Insurance Open prop picks or other PGA Tour bets on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up over $8,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.This same model has also nailed a whopping 16 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- as well as this year's PGA Championship and Open Championship. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting sites. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Top 2026 Farmers Insurance Open prop picksJ.J. Spaun to finish top 5 (+550)Si Woo Kim to finish top 10 (+290)Jason Day (-140) over Keegan Bradley in a tournament matchupJ.J. Spaun to finish in the top 5 (+550)Spaun was a longshot winner of last year's U.S. Open for his second career PGA Tour victory, and that played a key part in his best FedEx Cup finish on the Tour, placing T25 after barely cracking the top 100 and finishing 98th the year before. Spaun made 21 of 25 cuts last year after making just 16 of 28 the year before. In his season debut this year, Spaun closed the Sony Open with a 4-under 66 on the final round, and the model thinks he can carry that momentum into this weekend. The 35-year-old finished T15 at last year's Farmers Insurance Open. He ranked seventh on the PGA Tour in total strokes gained last year, and the model projects value in him at +550 odds to crack the top 5 this weekend. Click here to bet on Spaun at FanDuel, where new users receieve $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins. Si Woo Kim to finish top 10 (+290)Kim is a four-time PGA Tour winner, and the 30-year-old had three top-10 finishes last year. He missed the cut at last year's Farmers Insurance Open, but he's made it in six of eight career appearances. Kim finished T6 at last week's American Express and just missed the top 10 in the tournament before, finishing T11 at the Sony Open. He's off to a fast start, ranking sixth on the PGA Tour in scoring average, fifth in driving accuracy and ninth in both strokes gained: Off the Tee and strokes gained: Approach to Green. Given his hot start and experience at the Farmers Insurance Open, the model sees value at him at nearly 3-1 odds to finish in the top 10 this weekend. Click here to bet on Kim at FanDuel, where new users receieve $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins. Jason Day (-140) over Keegan BradleyThis is the first tournament the two will compete in together this year, but their starts to the 2026 PGA Tour season have been significantly different. Bradley missed the cut at the Sony Open, while Day finished T2 at last week's American Express. Day closed with an 8-under 64 on Sunday to finish with the best score for anyone not named Scottie Scheffler, which often seems to be the best you can ask for when golfing against the world's No. 1. Two of Day's 13 career PGA Tour wins have come at the Farmers Insurance Open, and he has seven top-10 finishes over his last 13 appearances in this tournament. Meanwhile, Bradley, the most recent USA Ryder Cup captain, has just one top-10 finish over his last six Farmers Insurance Opens. The model expects Day to fight for a top-five spot, while Bradley doesn't crack its top 10. Caesars Sportsbook offers this Farmers Insurance Open prop bet, and you can click here to bet on Day at Caesars Sportsbook, where new users receive a first bet match up to $250 bonus bet win or lose with the promo code CBSSPORTS250BM.Want more picks for the 2026 Farmers Insurance Open?You've seen the SportsLine model's 2026 Farmers Insurance Open props for this weekend.

The Tuesday college basketball schedule features a top-five matchup with No. 3 Michigan (18-1) hosting No. 5 Nebraska (20-0), and one of SportsLine's top experts has locked in a pick on this contest. The SportsLine Projection Model also has one of its top picks coming from a ranked college basketball matchup, backing unranked Oklahoma to defeat No. 15 Arkansas at home as +130 underdogs in one of its Tuesday best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook. The Razorbacks are favored by 2.5 points on the road at Oklahoma. The model has also locked in an NBA best bet, backing the Milwaukee Bucks as 10.5-point underdogs against the Philadelphia 76ers, despite this being their first game since Giannis Antetokounmpo's calf injury from Friday. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every NBA game 10,000 times and has returned well over $10,000 in betting profit for $100 players on its top-rated NBA picks over the past eight-plus seasons.

They were supposed to play Sunday, but that game was postponed due to travel issues from the winter storm, giving the Bucks more time to rest and also strengthen their on-court chemistry in preperation of playing without Antetokounmpo. The 31-year-old superstar also missed three weeks in December with a calf injury, and the Bucks went 4-4 against the spread during that time. They only lost two games by more than 10 points, though. While the Bucks are rested, the 76ers are playing the second half of a back-to-back following a 130-93 loss to the Hornets. Neither Joel Embiid (knee) nor Paul George (knee) played Monday, so they could suit up for the second half of the back-to-back, but still, the model views 10.5 points as too drastic a number. The 76ers are home, but they are 12-13 overall and 11-14 ATS at home this season. Bet the Bucks to cover at DraftKings here:Michigan (-10.5) vs. Nebraska (-105)\"Nebraska's non-conference SOS ranks #299, showing their strong record is built on weak opponents,\" SportsLine expert Jeff Hochman said.\"They're unbeaten in Big Ten play but benefited from close wins and a high \"Luck\" rating (#33 KenPom). Michigan, with a non-conference SOS of 14th, is No. 2 in KenPom and boasts an Adjusted Efficiency Margin (+35.87) nearly 8 points higher than Nebraska. Such a gap signals a major mismatch. It's the equivalent of a Final 4 team against a Sweet 16 squad. Michigan's top-ranked 2-point offense and defense, while playing the 7th hardest schedule, make them a powerhouse. Nebraska is a poor offensive rebounding team (17th Big Ten, 304th nationally), limiting second-chance points. On the road against Michigan's physicality and the Crisler Center crowd, Nebraska faces a \"market correction\" blowout. Bet Michigan to cover at DraftKings here:Oklahoma (+130) to defeat ArkansasThe model doesn't believe the Sooners are as bad as their 1-6 SEC record indicates, with all six of their losses coming either on the road or against a ranked team. Oklahoma faces another ranked team in its building on Tuesday, but the Sooners nearly defeated No. 18 Alabama in an 83-81 home loss on Jan. 17, and they are coming off a buzzer-beater road loss to Missouri on Saturday. They are a few bounces away from winning two of three entering this contest. Akransas is 5-2 in SEC play this season, but the Sooners defeated the Razorbacks in Arkansas last season. Oklahoma has won three of its last four games against Arkansas. The model projects the Sooners to win in 57% of simulations, showcasing solid value at plus-money odds. Bet Oklahoma to win at DraftKings here:\nWant more NBA, college basketball picks for Tuesday?You've seen some of the model's Tuesday best bets.

Purdue has been on a run with the Over as of late as Boilermakers' games have eclipsed the total at a 6-2 clip over the last eight. A big reason for that is Purdue's highly efficient offense, which ranks second in KenPom's offensive rating as Matt Painter's crew is eighth in the nation in field goal percentage.As for the Hoosiers, their offense is ahead of their defense as they are 28th, nationally, in offensive efficiency compared to 57th on the defensive end. Indiana is projected to have the leading scorer in this contest, with Lamar Wilkerson surpassing 20 points, as he's one of eight total players forecasted to reach double-digits. That allows the Over to hit with points to spare with the model calling for 158 combined points. Thus, the Over hits 65.3% of the time.The model also says one side of the spread hits nearly 60% of the time. You can only see that pick at SportsLine.So who wins Indiana vs. Purdue, and which side of the spread hits nearly 60% of the time? Visit SportsLine now to see which side of the Purdue vs. Indiana spread to back, all from the advanced model that has simulated this game 10,000 times, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        LONDON -- New York to London might not be a particularly arduous journey for most, even via southern Spain, but Gotham FC's road to the British capital has been a long and winding one. The NWSL champions take the field at the Brentford Community Stadium Wednesday, not as holders of the title they won in such dramatic fashion back in November. Instead, it is the title before that, one won by a team that has predominantly broken apart, that set this club on a journey they hope will end with them crowned the first world champions of women's club football.The then-NJ/NY Gotham FC side that beat OL Reign in the 2023 NWSL Championship game would face off against the best of CONCACAF the following year before raising the continent's first championship in Leon, Mexico, 18 months after they had qualified for the competition. That in turn earned them the right to travel across the Atlantic as North America's first representatives in the FIFA Women's Champions Cup, the annual intercontinental clash that, at least until the Women's Club World Cup begins in two years' time, will crown the sport's best club side.No wonder that in such a long stretch, so few of those who began the journey are still there. Only three of the starting XI that Juan Carlos Amoros named for that 2023 final are still with the club as they arrive in London. When the head coach explains the long journey to Hounslow, it seems faintly remarkable anyone is still standing.\"It would be a dream come true for us to be in this position two games away,\" said Amoros. \"Something that is very special.\n\"It's been a process of four years it's taken us to get to this competition. We need to win the [NWSL] championship, go next year around North America to qualify for the semifinal, final. Last season, we were able to win in Mexico and now we're here. \"It will be the pinnacle, the top of the mountain [if we win] at this point. But, we also know that there is even more competitions that we want to keep winning.\"The Women's Champions Cup too has come the long way round. In November, Wuhan Jiangda beat Auckland United on home soil before themselves losing to home favorites AS Far in Morocco last month. Now the final four -- representing North America, South America, Africa and Europe -- meet in London, the semifinals at Brentford's home on Wednesday before Arsenal's 60,000 capacity Emirates Stadium hosts the third place playoff and final on Sunday. Gotham's campaign begins against Corinthians, by far the dominant force in both Brazilian and South American football, the winners of six of the last nine iterations of the Copa Libertadores.\nDespite the impressive record of their opponents, few are in any doubt as to who the strong favorites should be when the two sides take the field at 12:30 p.m. local time (7:30 a.m. ET). After all, this is the best that the NWSL has to offer, at least according to the playoffs, if not the final standings in the league. Gotham would probably have to acknowledge that they are strong favorites for the semifinal, perhaps even for the competition as a whole.\"You always got to bet on yourself,\" joked Jaelin Howell. \"We're our own favorites, put it that way,\" said defender Mandy Freeman, a veteran of that long road to CONCACAF glory and beyond. \"We hope we are,\" added Jaedyn Shaw.Whether they actually are, well, that is what makes the Champions Cup so intriguing. When these sorts of competitions take place in the men's game, there is an inherently limiting factor, the economic reality of the sport. In both the old and new formats of the men's Club World Cup, South American clubs certainly roused themselves to punch above their weight, but that was the point. When the continent's richest side, Flamengo, trail Real Madrid by the best part of $1 billion in revenue, there's not really much of a case against deciding the best men's club side in the Champions League.\nIn the women's game, the margins are finer, financially and perhaps on the field. Arsenal's Champions League triumph last summer made them Europe's richest club side with revenue Deloitte estimated at around $30 million. Transpose that over to the NWSL and the Gunners would certainly be one of the league's top earners, but, according to Forbes, they would not match Angel City and Kansas City Current.The relative parity between NWSL and Europe's top clubs is reflected in player movement. Jenna Nighswonger and Crystal Dunn are among the former Gotham players who moved to Europe while Amoros' squad has been strengthened by the addition of Ann-Katrin Berger and Jess Carter to a group that also includes Spain international Esther.That sense of meaningful stakes between the best of each continent offers a sense of importance to this competition that perhaps mitigates against the fears of jamming more games into an overwhelming schedule.\n\"When we played the CONCACAF Women's Cup, which was the first time as well, we showed the players some pictures of competitions from the past,\" said Amoros. \"You could see, for example, Sweden, the first Euros [sic, the first European Championships were indeed won by the Swedes against England in a two-legged final where both nations hosted], where there were fewer fans, less recognition. The Champions League, all these competitions had to start somewhere.  \"This is something that in the women's game also needed to happen. So I'm super happy that we as Gotham are going to be in this competition in the 2028 one [the Club World Cup} as well. Hopefully, we are again next year. I think it's truly important. And I think in the women's game, it's a slightly different, the global stage, if you want to call it. But I think in the men's, realistically, Europe is clearly the dominant.\"Every player in the world wants to come to Europe. While in the women's game, we could definitely say that the NWSL is at least at the same level. So I think that makes it even more interesting. Internationally, obviously, the U.S. at an international level has been the dominant country the last couple of decades. And I think it's really something different to the men's and we want to make it even better. So hopefully this tournament is the first of many.\"\nWhether it will be the first of many won by an NWSL representative is another question. Gotham might find themselves at a disadvantage in a putative final against Arsenal. They have spent the last three weeks in a warm weather training camp in Sotogrande, Spain, but that is no match for the competitive gearing up the Gunners have had in the midst of a WSL season that saw them win 2-0 at champions Chelsea at the weekend.Arsenal too pride themselves on their firsts: first in attendances, first in league titles won, the first English side to win the European Cup, and indeed the second. \"We're proud to be in this competition,\" said Arsenal coach Renee Slegers. \"We want to compete for trophies. This is a new trophy in women's football. And I think Arsenal have been trailblazers for long. We want to be part of that. We want to make history as well.\"\nOf course, it is presumptive to think about the final already when an unfamiliar opponent lies ahead of Gotham. Corinthians are nothing if not used to winning and their squad includes a host of veterans including Tamires, winner of 148 Brazil caps, and captain Gabi Zanotti, the most successful player in the club's history and, at 40 years of age, nearly a year Marta's senior.Gotham have never played a Brazilian opponent before but they can at least rely on intel from their teammate Gabi Portilho, who joined from the Brabas (roughly translated as 'the fierce girls') in December 2024. Brazil international Bruninha is also well aware of how her international teammates from Corinthians might test their U.S. opponents.\"It's nice for us to be able to see their style of play, the Brazilian players,\" said Shaw. \"Seeing how they play and playing against them every day is super helpful. Them being in Brazil with those players and that team is really helpful, as well as scouting.\"\nGotham will also be able to deploy some Brazilian flair of their own in the form of Shaw, whose formative years involved several trips to Brazil where she played futsal with Santos' women's team.\"It really shaped me as a player to be honest, seeing the vision on the field, knowing how to combine in small spaces, getting out of them on the dribble and the pass: those are some of my strengths,\" she said. \"Just being around Brazilian culture, football and futsal, is something I think really helped me build the passion for the game. It's really where I fell in love with it, I would definitely credit a lot of the way I play to that country.\"Her footballing identity having been so strongly forged in Sao Paulo, Shaw is surely going to be even more eager to get one over on one of Santos' historic rivalries. Then again she is far from the only Gotham star with plenty to motivate themselves in the days ahead. It has taken a long time for Gotham to get this far. They aren't minded to slow down with the summit in sight.\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe NHL is less than two weeks away from its 19-day break for the 2026 Winter Olympics. With the way January has gone for the Colorado Avalanche, the respite can't come soon enough.Colorado steamrolled over the rest of the league during the first three months of the 2025-26 NHL season, going 7-1-4 in October, 11-0-2 in November and 12-1-1 in December. The team hasn't been nearly as dominant since the new calendar year began, however, as it has lost six of its 11 games -- including four in regulation, which is twice as many outings it came away without a point over its first 40 contests.The Avalanche (35-6-9) have five games remaining before the league's lengthy Olympic hiatus, three of which take place in January. Those three contests are all on the road, where the club has suffered four of its six regulation losses this campaign.Colorado, which owns a nine-point lead over the Tampa Bay Lightning in the race for the Presidents' Trophy and is 11 points ahead of the Minnesota Wild for the top spot in the Western Conference, went 1-1-1 in Week 16. Six teams finished the week without a regulation loss, with the Buffalo Sabres, Florida Panthers and Pittsburgh Penguins all going 3-0-0 and the Los Angeles Kings winning a pair of contests before their scheduled game against the Blue Jackets in Columbus on Monday was postponed due to a major winter storm.Only three clubs failed to get in the win column last week, as the Calgary Flames, St. Louis Blues and Toronto Maple Leafs all posted 0-2-1 records. Each week during the season I'll rank the league's top 10 teams based on both the previous week's performances and overall body of work in 2025-26. I'll also give brief synopsis for each club that explains why they're ranked where they are.Let's dive into the power ratings entering Week 17 of the 2025-26 NHL season and highlight a few of the teams' notable accomplishments.NHL Week 17 power ratings 1. Colorado Avalanche (1-1-1 in Week 16; 35-6-9 overall)Despite having gone 4-4-2 over its last 10 contests, Colorado joined the 1943-44 Montreal Canadiens, 1975-76 Canadiens and 1979-80 Philadelphia Flyers as the only teams in NHL history with fewer than seven regulation losses over their first 50 games of a season. The Avalanche began Week 16 at home with a shootout loss to the Anaheim Ducks and a 7-3 setback against the Flyers before ending it with a 4-1 triumph over the Toronto Maple Leafs in the opener of their four-game road trip. Brock Nelson registered his fifth career hat trick in that victory to give him 27 goals, one more than he registered in 80 games last season. The 34-year-old center has netted 13 tallies over his last 13 contests. Nelson has been equally effective this campaign, scoring 14 times at home and 13 on the road. Nathan MacKinnon produced only three assists last week and now trails Edmonton Oilers superstar Connor McDavid (92) by four points for the league lead but still is first with 38 goals, even though he's converted in only one of his last seven outings.2. Tampa Bay Lightning (3-1-0; 33-14-4)The Lightning have been one of the NHL's hottest teams since mid-December, going 15-1-1 over their last 17 games. The club won three of its four contests in Week 16 and has allowed fewer than two goals in each of its past six victories. The quartet of Nikita Kucherov (two goals, eight assists), Jake Guentzel (three, three), Brandon Hagel (two, four) and Anthony Cirelli (three, four) led Tampa Bay last week, producing 10 of the team's 12 goals. Darren Raddysh netted the other two tallies, converting in each of the last two games to give him 14 goals in 45 games this season. The 29-year-old defenseman amassed 13 tallies in 176 contests over his first four NHL campaigns. Kucherov has landed on the scoresheet in 16 of his last 17 outings, collecting 13 goals and 25 assists over that span, and hasn't gone back-to-back games without a point since Nov. 8 and 12.3. Carolina Hurricanes (1-0-1; 32-15-5)The Hurricanes only played twice last week, losing to the Chicago Blackhawks in a shootout before cruising past the Ottawa Senators 4-1. The team scored a total of seven goals, with seven different players converting. Jackson Blake, Seth Jarvis and Taylor Hall each recorded a tally and an assist in Week 16, while defenseman Jalen Chatfield set up a pair of scores. Sebastian Aho did not factor in the team's scoring in Week 16 after collecting seven assists over his previous three games but leads Carolina with 52 points. Brandon Bussi, who was in the crease against Ottawa,  has allowed just one goal in each of his last three starts and is third in the NHL with a 3.15 goals-against average.4. Detroit Red Wings (2-0-1; 32-16-5)Detroit enters Week 17 with a five-game point streak (4-0-1) and eight wins in its last 10 contests. Last week, the club sandwiched triumphs over Toronto and the Winnipeg Jets around an overtime loss to Minnesota. Lucas Raymond, who leads the Red Wings in both assists (40) and points (58), has posted back-to-back multi-point performances and is riding a five-game point streak during which he has collected three goals and five assists. The 23-year-old Swedish left wing has landed on the scoresheet in 14 of his last 17 outings. Alex DeBrincat netted his 27th tally of the campaign in the victory against Winnipeg, marking the eighth time he has reached that mark in his nine NHL seasons.5. Minnesota Wild (1-1-1; 29-14-10)Each of the Wild's three games in Week 16 had a final score of 4-3, with the team defeating Detroit in overtime while losing to Montreal in regulation and Florida in OT. Kirill Kaprizov had a big offensive week, recording three goals and four assists, while Mats Zuccarello netted two tallies and set up four others. The 38-year-old Zuccarello is in the midst of a five-game point streak during which he has notched three goals and six assists. Kaprizov also has gotten on the scoresheet in five straight contests, posting a multi-point performance in each outing. Defenseman Quinn Hughes is riding a five-game point streak as well, amassing a goal and eight assists during his run. Matt Boldy returned from a four-game absence due to a lower-body injury on Saturday and made his presence felt as he had a goal and an assist against the Panthers.6. Dallas Stars (2-1-0; 29-14-9)After a difficult Week 15 in which they lost all three of their games while scoring just one goal in each, the Stars won two of their three contests last week. Leading scorer Mikko Rantanen (63 points) missed two of those games with an illness, but Jason Robertson and Wyatt Johnston picked up the slack by combining for five goals and two assists in Dallas' victories. Robertson is third in the NHL with 30 tallies while Johnston is tied for eighth with 27. Miro Heiskanen collected four assists over the team's three contests and ranks seventh in the league with 33. 7. Buffalo Sabres (3-0-0; 29-17-5)The Sabres have been just as hot as the Lightning as they are 18-3-1 since Dec. 9 after having won all three of their games last week. Those three victories came on the road, with Buffalo scoring at least four goals in each. Veteran left wing Jason Zucker has scored three goals over his last two contests after tallying just twice in his previous 11 outings. Peyton Krebs also broke out of an offensive slump as he collected two goals and two assists in three games last week after netting one tally and setting up two others over his previous 10 contests. Konsta Helenius made his NHL debut in Week 15 and was kept off the scoresheet by the Carolina Hurricanes, but the 19-year-old Finnish center had a goal and two assists in Buffalo's 5-3 triumph over the Nashville Predators last Tuesday and set up a tally in a 4-2 victory against Montreal two days later.8. Pittsburgh Penguins (3-0-0; 26-14-11)The Penguins won all three of their contests in Week 16 to wrap up a 4-0-0 road trip and extend their point streak to seven games (5-0-2). Pittsburgh allowed fewer than three goals in each outing last week and have done so in seven of their last 10 contests. Evgeni Malkin, who tallied in every Week 16 game and added a pair of assists, has landed on the scoresheet in 10 of his last 12 outings. Anthony Mantha had a two-goal performance in last Thursday's 6-2 victory against Edmonton and rookie Ben Kindel recorded one of his own two days later in a 3-2 triumph over the Vancouver Canucks. Defenseman Jack St. Ivany got involved offensively last week, posting back-to-back two-assist efforts against the Calgary Flames and Oilers after having set up only three goals in his first 14 games this season.9. Boston Bruins (2-1-1; 30-20-3)The Bruins' six-game slide (0-4-2) in late December has become a distant memory as the team has earned points in 11 of its 13 contests since (10-2-1). Boston began last week with a 6-2 setback against the Stars in Dallas that ended its six-game winning streak but rebounded with triumphs over the Vegas Golden Knights and Canadiens before squandering a third-period lead versus the New York Rangers on Monday and settling for one point in a 4-3 overtime loss. Morgan Geekie scored four goals in Week 16 to increase his season total to a team-leading 29, four shy of the career high he set last campaign, and added a pair of assists while Elias Lindholm netted three tallies and set up two others. David Pastrnak collected a goal and seven assists as he extended his point streak to seven games. The 29-year-old Czech right wing has notched at least one point in 12 of his last 13 contests, amassing six tallies and 20 assists over that span. Defenseman Charlie McAvoy picked up a goal and four assists in Week 16 and has landed on the scoresheet in 11 of his last 13 outings.10. Florida Panthers (3-0-0; 28-20-3)Florida is coming off a perfect week as it got past Winnipeg 2-1 in a shootout, edged Minnesota 4-3 in overtime and manhandled Chicago 5-1. Brad Marchand returned from a seven-game absence due to an undisclosed injury to record two goals -- including the overtime winner -- and an assist against the Wild. Sam Bennett and Sam Reinhart also scored twice in Week 16, with the latter also notching an assist, while defenseman Tobias Bjornfot netted a pair of tallies versus the Blackhawks -- his first two since recording his first NHL goal in 2020-21 while with the Los Angeles Kings. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        San Antonio Spurs star Victor Wembanyama spoke out Tuesday about the recent shootings by federal officers in Minneapolis, and said that he is \"horrified\" by the \"murder of civilians.\" On Saturday, ICU nurse Alex Pretti was shot and killed by a U.S. Border Patrol agent in Minneapolis. His death came just weeks after Renee Good was shot and killed by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, also in Minneapolis. Their deaths, and the broader actions of ICE and Border Patrol personnel during Operation Metro Surge, have sparked protests and outrage in Minneapolis and across the country.The 22-year-old Wembanyama spoke to reporters after practice on Tuesday. Wembanyama said the team's staff had tried to caution him about what to say on the matter, but he decided not to give a \"politically correct\" answer. At the same time, however, Wembanyama admitted that he did not want to go any more in depth because of the \"cost\" it would have. Here are the full comments from the French-born Wembanyama:\"PR has tried but I'm not gonna sit here and give some politically correct [answer],\" Wembanyama said. \"Every day I wake up and see the news and I'm horrified. It's crazy that some people make it seem like it's acceptable, like the murder of civilians is acceptable. I read the news and sometimes I'm asking very deep questions about my own life, but I'm concious also that saying everything that's on my mind would have a cost that's too great for me right now, so I'd rather not into too many details.\"\nWembanyama was then asked if the fear of repercussions for speaking their mind was weighing on him and other players. \"For sure. It's terrible,\" said Wembanyama, \"I know I'm a foreigner, I live in this country and I am concerned for sure.\"Finally, Wembanyama was asked if being a foreigner was part of his hesitance to speak more freely. \n\"For sure, for sure,\" Wembanyama said.Webanyama, the No. 1 pick in the 2023 NBA Draft, was recently selected to the All-Star Game for the second season in a row. He's averaged 24.2 points, 11.1 rebounds and 2.7 blocks per game in 32 appearances so far this season.\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves were supposed to play the Golden State Warriors Saturday, just hours after Pretti was killed, but the NBA decided to postpone the game until Sunday. The NBPA released a statement Sunday which said, in part, that players can \"no longer remain silent.\" Here is the full statement:\n\"Following the news of yet another fatal shooting in Minneapolis, a city that has been on the forefront of the fight against injustices, NBA players can no longer remain silent.  \"Now more than ever, we must defend the right to freedom of speech and stand in solidarity with the people in Minnesota protesting and risking their lives to demand justice. \"The fraternity of NBA players, like the United States itself, is a community enriched by its global citizens, and we refuse to let the flames of division threaten the civil liberties that are meant to protect us all. \"The NBPA and its members extend our deepest condolences to the families of Alex Pretti and Renee Good, just as our thoughts remain focused on the safety and well-being of all members of our community.\"Wembanyama is not the only player who has issued a strong personal statement on the matter. Indiana Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton wrote on social media, \"Alex Pretti was murdered.\" Additionally, WNBA star Breanna Stewart held up a sign that read \"Abolish ICE\" prior to an Unrivaled game on Sunday. \n            ",

This is Saleh's second coaching opportunity after he spent three-plus years with New York Jets from 2021-24. Like Saleh, Daboll is a former coach who was fired during his fourth season on the job. Daboll served as the New York Giants' coach for three-plus years before he was relieved of his duties this season when New York got off to a 2-8 start. The Giants have since replaced Daboll with John Harbaugh, who was fired by the Baltimore Ravens shortly after the 2025 regular season concluded.\nWhile it didn't end on a great note, Daboll's time in the Big Apple did include leading the Giants to the franchise's first playoff win since defeating the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLVI. The Giants were unable to match that success during Daboll's final three seasons, however, which led to his firing. It's worth noting that Daboll's time in New York also included several personnel decisions by general manager Joe Schoen that didn't age well, most notably his decision to pay Daniel Jones over Saquon Barkley, then releasing Jones less than two years later. \nPrior to coming to New York, Daboll enjoyed a successful four-year run as the Bills' offensive coordinator while working with quarterback Josh Allen. His NFL coaching background also includes offensive coordinator stints with the Cleveland Browns, Miami Dolphins and Kansas City Chiefs. Daboll also won five Super Bowls as a member of the New England Patriots' coaching staff.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Nearly eight months into his recovery from a torn Achilles, Indiana Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton continues to progress toward an eventual return to the court, although that will not come until the 2026-27 season. Haliburton has progressed to playing full-court 4-on-4 games against team interns and some of the Pacers' reserves but said on the \"Mind the Game\" podcast with LeBron James that he still has \"some time\" before he will be back to his old self.The new version of Haliburton that takes the floor next season may also be a bit larger and take on a more physical play style. Indiana's point guard said he is up 30 pounds since the last game of the 2025 season and that if he maintains some of that new weight, he can use size to his advantage when he returns.\"That's really something that I'm trying to focus on through my rehab, through my time to get back is just being more physical,\" Haliburton said. \"I was 180 pounds on Game 7 day. I'm 210 right now. I'm up 30 pounds, bro. And obviously when I start to run, I'm gonna get that off me. Some of it's not good because I've been drowning my sorrows in cookies and ice cream and stuff. But I think I see that and it's a way for me to be more physical at the rim, to get more free throws.\"Getting into chests, tangling arms, making all these perfect reads to get to the free throw line is just something I'm really trying to focus on adding through rehab as I watch the game.\"\nTime away from the court also allows Haliburton to watch games through a different lens. Rather than taking in game film from a scouting perspective, the 25-year-old Iowa State product has spent time putting himself in other players' shoes and learning about tendencies and skills that he can adopt when he is back at full strength.In fact, Haliburton pointed to Boston Celtics guard Payton Pritchard as a player who boasts the kind of physical game he wishes to emulate.\"I think seeing the game of basketball, I'm watching it in a different light,\" Haliburton said. \"I think it's different when you're getting ready to play a team like Boston, for example, and we've got Payton Pritchard. He's nice. All I'm focused on is can I get a stop. I'm not thinking about how he's making his reads and stuff.\"\nPlaying bigger and stronger after his extended layoff could help Haliburton take his game to the next level. He is already a versatile defender and talented scorer but stands to benefit from putting good weight onto his frame.If Haliburton becomes the latest player to fully overcome what is so often a devastating injury, the best days of his career as a burgeoning superstar could still lie ahead. But the NBA is still months away from learning whether that will be the case for the two-time All-Star and 2024 assists leader.\"The biggest thing is I really am glad for where I am,\" Haliburton said. \"I'm thankful for it. The process has sucked, man. There's been good days, bad days. There's been days where I sit there and I keep asking, 'Why is this happening to me?' It's hard for me to understand in this moment, but I understand that it's allowing me to grow in different ways, to grow in my faith, to grow in all these different ways that have been good for me.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Ahead of the World Cup, transfers take on a much greater importance. If you're already a starter at a club, leaving with six months to go until the tournament takes place has heightened risks and rewards. The possibility a move goes wrong and a player falls out of contention at his new club always looms, but if all goes well, and a player excels, the right move could elevate a squad player on his national team to a starting role. That's the position right back Alex Freeman hopes to find himself in. After breaking onto the United States men's national team scene, Freeman could be set to continue his meteoric rise with a move to Spanish club Villarreal, according to the Athletic. For a player who just made their first start for Orlando City SC in March of 2025 before winning the league's Young Player of the Year award in October, it's wild to consider what a difference a year makes, but Freeman has met every test in his career so far, and a move to Spain could see him compete with Sergino Dest for the starting right back role on the USMNT. With Villarreal needing to replace starting right back Juan Foyth, after the team confirmed he injured in Achilles tendon over the weekend, there's very much a chance that Freeman could end up as a starter with the club. The Yellow Sumbarine are also very familiar with MLS, as Tajon Buchanan and Tami Oluwaseyi are currently contributing to the squad.But it's far from a sure thing. Freeman will have a learning curve making the jump to Spain. While he's used to operating in attacking areas as a modern fullback, Freeman has largely been able to get by on his physical tools. As a multi-sport athlete growing up, he's been able to use that and size to his advantage in MLS, but moving abroad, work on defensive positioning and passing will need to be done. Spain is a good place to do that due to it being quite a technical league, but Freeman's physical skills will also help with that.As you can see in the chart below, which compares Freeman to other wing backs and fullbacks, his attacking production has been elite for Orlando, but his passing and defending still leave a lot of room for growth, to put it gently.\n\n                                                                    CBS Sports\n                                                            His first start for the USMNT was facing Turkiye in a friendly in June, where Freeman had the unenviable task of tracking Kenan Yildiz in the match. While he was beaten at the start of the match, it was something that he recovered from to now be on the cusp of making the World Cup\"It was my first U.S. game, my first start, and I look up, and I have to go against the guy who has played for Juventus and has been a key player. So I feel like going into that kind of game, it was a moment where I'm like, dang, I really have to be at my best,\" Freeman said about that experience, speaking to CBS Sports in October. \"That first pass I got beaten behind, and after that I was like, 'Oh my god, it's going to be a long game,' me trying to get comfortable and find confidence in myself in that kind of game.\"For a young player, being able to go into the deep end and come out swimming is an intangible that can't always be accounted for. Some players have the tools, but when they're faced with a challenge, aren't able to rise to the occasion; that hasn't been the case for Freeman so far. Even when it comes to leaving Orlando for a move to Spain, when he left home at 16 to join the Weston FC academy, the 21-year-old is better adjusted for this move than the average young player leaving MLS.\nOf course, a move doesn't come without risk, but given Villarreal's work with MLS exports and Freeman's ability to adapt, it's a match that could work on paper if he's able to improve his game to thrive in Spain. And that's where things could get interesting because with how rapid Freeman's improvement has been, the World Cup on home soil could be a fascinating time. USMNT outlook During 2025, only two players, Diego Luna and Max Arfsten, earned more caps for the UMSNT than Freeman's 13, despite the right back making his debut for the team. He was even able to open his USMNT scoring account in a big way with a brace against Uruguay in one of the team's best performances of the year under Mauricio Pochettino. With the right back position very much unsettled heading into a critical March where the USMNT will face Belgium and Portugal, Freeman will have time to work with the squad in Villarreal and see if he can push for a starting role.With Tim Weah and Dest both playing right back or right wing back at a Champions League level for Marseille and PSV, respectively, there will be a lot for Freeman to do, especially since sitting on the bench in Spain could hurt his chances of making the World Cup squad. It's an ultimate situation of betting on yourself as a player, and for Villarreal, with the move only costing a reported $4 million up front, it's a worthwhile flier for them. With other prominent moves like Fulham chasing Ricardo Pepi, and Toronto FC after Josh Sargent, Freeman may not be the only American on the move, but he could be the one to end up in the best position to hit the ground running in Spain. This is something that could leave Pochettino with tough decisions to make moving forward, but with the USMNT looking to better their round of 16 finish at the 2022 World Cup, that's only a good thing.\n            ",

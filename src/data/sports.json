Los Angeles also boasts a 4-2 straight-up record at Seattle over the last six meetings, which includes a postseason contest. L.A. has the league's best offense, topping the NFL in both points and yards, as well as yards per play. It's also a team that doesn't beat itself, as Sean McVay's crew committed the fewest penalties in the regular season, and only three teams had fewer turnovers. The defense is also elite in several areas, including allowing the fewest rushing touchdowns in 2025, having the fourth-best pressure rate and notching the fifth-most takeaways. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Seahawks can coverNo team has a better spread record than Seattle, which has gone 13-5 versus the line over the regular plus postseason. The Seahawks are riding an eight-game outright win streak, with the last three of those all coming by double-digits against NFC playoff teams. Also, one can't discount that Seattle is coming off a Saturday game, with the Rams playing a Sunday overtime game, and the former boasts a 5-1 ATS record with a rest edge. On the field, the Seahawks' defense is the best unit in all of football, ranking first in points allowed, allowing the fewest yards per rush and giving up the fewest yards per pass. That overshadows the fact they also have the No. 3 scoring offense, and it's one which is coming off its second-most points (41) in franchise postseason history. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Rams vs. Seahawks    picksSportsLine's model has simulated Seahawks vs. Rams 10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 48 combined points.

Arizona (18-0) received all 61 first-place votes this week after picking up wins over Arizona State and UCF and remained in the top spot for the sixth consecutive week. Iowa State was one of five teams in Division I basketball that entered last week without a loss. That number reduced to three after ISU and Vanderbilt went 0-2 last week. Iowa State, the only other team that received a first-place vote in last week's poll outside of Arizona, dropped seven spots to No. 9. Vanderbilt fell from No. 10 to No. 15. Nebraska made history in this week's poll by moving up to No. 7, which marked its highest ranking in program history. The Cornhuskers improved to 18-0 with wins over Oregon and Northwestern. Nebraska, Arizona and Miami (Ohio) are the final teams in the sport that haven't suffered a loss. The Redhawks, now No. 25, are ranked for the first time since a three-week stint in the AP Top 25 during the 1998-99 season. One of the biggest losers of last week was North Carolina. The Tar Heels went 0-2 on their West Coast road trip with losses to Cal and Stanford. North Carolina dropped eight spots to No. 22 after falling to 2-3 in ACC play.AP Top 251. Arizona (61)2. UConn3.

    "body": "\n        With 15.2 seconds remaining in the Houston Rockets' win over the New Orleans Pelicans on Sunday, the crowd inside the Toyota Center rose to its feet as Kevin Durant strode to the free-throw line. Durant received the ball from the ref, went through his normal routine and hit nothing but net on his first attempt. Free throws, even those that help seal a victory, don't usually deserve standing ovations, but with that make Durant passed Dirk Nowitzki to move into sixth place on the NBA's all-time scoring list. \nIronically, Durant had one of his worst game of the season against the Pelicans -- 18 points on 5-of-18 shooting -- but he did enough to move up another rung on the all-time scoring ladder. Durant now has 31,562 career points, and only needs 731 to pass Michael Jordan and move into the top five. PlayerCareer points1. LeBron James42,7272. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar38,3873. Karl Malone36,9284. Kobe Bryant33,6435. Michael Jordan32,2926. Kevin Durant31,562Sunday's poor shooting performance aside, Durant is putting together another incredible scoring season: 26.1 points per game on 51/39.3/88.7 shooting splits. At that pace, he'll need just 29 more games to pass Jordan. The Rockets have 42 games remaining in the season, and assuming Durant doesn't miss any significant time, he should move ahead of Jordan in mid- to late-March. Durant (again, assuming health) should have no trouble catching Bryant, who is 2,081 points ahead of him, at some point next season. It will be a number of years until the 37-year-old Durant has a chance to move into the top three, however. He needs 5,366 points to catch Malone, and may have to play into his 40s to do so. Whether he'll be willing or able to play that long remains to be seen. \"To be up there with Dirk, somebody I looked up to, I idolized, I competed against. We had some great battles. He always was supportive of my career and my game. So, you know to be up there with a legend like that, it's just insane. And be right under Michael Jordan, it's crazy man, Durant said. \"I want to continue to keep stacking, keep climbing up the charts, just see how I finish. It's been amazing so far.\"\nLet's take a closer look at how Durant is putting together yet another incredible season for the Rockets, who have won three of their last four to climb back into fifth place in the crowded Western Conference at 25-15. 'To be up there with a legend like that, it's just insane,' Durant said about passing Nowitzki. \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            KD is still incredibly efficientDurant's historic efficiency has long been his calling card. At 24 years old he became the joint-youngest player (along with Mark Price) to join the 50/40/90 club -- 50% shooting overall, 40% from 3-point range and 90% on free throws -- and is one of three players (along with Larry Bird and Steve Nash) to have multiple 50/40/90 seasons. His 29.1 points per game in 2023 are also the third-most by a player in a 50/40/90 season. Once again, Durant is within striking distance of a 50/40/90 season and has been one of the league's most efficient scorers. His 26.1 points per game rank 13th in the league. Of the top 15 scorers, only Nikola Jokić (60.5%) and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (54.7%) have a better field goal percentage than Durant, who has made 51% of his attempts. (Giannis Antetokounmpo has not played enough games to qualify for the official leaderboards, but he has also been more efficient than Durant.) Just look at his shot chart. The NBA's stat site breaks things down in 14 specific areas of the floor. Durant is only below the league average on right wing 3s. Kevin Durant's shot chart \n                                                                    NBA.com\n                                                            Tough shot-makingFew players make difficult shots look as easy as Durant, who, in his 18th season, is still among the league's best in this department. Durant is fourth in the league in mid-range attempts at 5.6 per game, and making 49.5% of them. Of the five players averaging at least five such attempts, only Gilgeous-Alexander (50.5%) has been more efficient. PlayerMid-range attemptsMid-range %Shai Gilgeous-Alexander550.5%Kevin Durant5.649.5%Brandon Ingram5.749%DeMar DeRozan6.547.8%Jaylen Brown5.944.8%Durant often acts as a safety valve for the Rockets' offense, which lacks a true point guard and spacing. As a result, he's tied for ninth in the league in late shot clock attempts (0-4 seconds remaining) per game at 1.9. Remarkably, he's shooting 50% on those attempts. No one else in the top-10 is shooting better than 44.3% (Jalen Brunson). \nFurthermore, the NBA has a new stat called expected field goal percentage, which uses a \"Shot Difficulty\" rating to measure the expected field goal percentage for the average NBA player on every shot. You can then compare a player's expected field goal percentage to their actual field goal percentage to get an idea of which players are best at making tough shots. To no surprise, Durant is right near the top. His expected field goal percentage is 43.9%, but he's shooting 51%. +7.1% differential ranks sixth in the league. PlayerxFG%FG%FG%+Nikola Jokić47.8%60.5%+12.7%Cam Spencer39.8%47.8%+8%Shai Gilgeous-Alexander47.3%54.7%+7.4%DeMar DeRozan43.6%50.8%+7.2%Steph Curry39.8%47%+7.2%Kevin Durant43.9%51%+7.1%However you want to slice it, Durant's shot-making has once again been incredible. \nAging with graceDurant was the No. 2 overall pick in the 2007 NBA Draft, and has spent nearly half of his life in the league. While most of his peers are out of the league or relegated to bit roles off the bench, Durant is likely going to make his 16th All-Star appearance, which would move him into fourth place on the all-time list, behind only LeBron James, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Kobe Bryant. Few players in NBA history have ever matched what Durant is doing at this stage of their career. No one has averaged more points in their 18th season. The only other players to average at least 26 points per game at 37 or older are James and Steph Curry. The only other players to average at least 18 shots per game and shoot 50% or better after turning 35 are James and Karl Malone. \n\"It means a great deal to be around the league for this long. I mean, it takes playing a thousand-plus games to be in this category, at least,\" Durant said Sunday. \"I'm grateful for all the people that have helped me play this many games -- coaches, friends, family that invested in my game. You know how it goes. Without them, without the village, I wouldn't be here. I don't do anything on my own. Never have, never will. It's great to kind of celebrate that with them.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Fresh off the first losing season of the Andy Reid-Patrick Mahomes era, the Kansas City Chiefs may decide to turn to a familiar face to help the team rebound in 2026. The Chiefs have reportedly requested permission to interview Eric Bieniemy, the team's former offensive coordinator who is currently serving as the running backs coach of the Chicago Bears.If granted, Bieniemy would interview for the offensive coordinator position currently being held by Matt Nagy, who is in the running for several head-coaching openings. Bieniemy, 56, helped the Chiefs win two Super Bowls during his five-year run as the team's offensive coordinator from 2018-22. During that time, the Chiefs boasted one of the NFL's most potent offenses, led by Mahomes and tight end Travis Kelce. Kansas City continued to have success on offense despite the departure of former All-Pro receiver Tyreek Hill following his departure after the 2021 season. \n        \n            \n                Ranking head coaching vacancies: Which of these eight remaining jobs is the most desirable?\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDespite the Chiefs' success over that span, Bieniemy did not receive any serious consideration for available head-coaching positions at that time. Because of that, he accepted a lateral move to the Washington Commanders in 2023, allowing him to call plays. He lasted just one year in Washington as the team struggled through a 4-13 season. \nBieniemy then had a brief tenure as UCLA's associate head coach and offensive coordinator before landing in Chicago as part of Ben Johnson's initial staff. This season, the Bears finished third in the NFL in both rushing yards and third in average yards per carry as running backs D'Andre Swift and rookie Kyle Monangai respectively ran for 1,087 and 783 yards and a combined 14 touchdowns. A former NFL running back, Bieniemy spent five years as a running backs coach in the college ranks before serving the same role with the Minnesota Vikings in 2006. During that time, he worked closely with Adrian Peterson, who was named to four straight Pro Bowls during his time with Bieniemy. \nBieniemy also served as the Chiefs' running backs coach for five years before being promoted to offensive coordinator in 2018, which was Mahomes' first season as the team's starting quarterback. That season, the Chiefs led the NFL in scoring while Mahomes threw a league-high 50 touchdowns. The Chiefs won their first of three Super Bowls over a five-year span the following season. \n            ",

One of the biggest beneficiaries of league games thus far has been Florida, which has quickly resurrected its season after a lackluster start by stacking impactful SEC wins. The reigning national champions are currently tied with Texas A&M atop the SEC standings at 4-1 thanks to an impressive four-game winning streak. Three of Florida's victories in that span have been against ranked opponents. As a result, the Gators jumped four spots to No. 16 in the latest Coaches Poll, which makes them among the highest-ranked teams in the SEC. They leapt past No. 17 Alabama and No. 20 Arkansas, though they remain behind No. 14 Vanderbilt, a team that they beat during their latest run.  Kansas has also hit its stride as of late. The Jayhawks picked up a pair of impactful Big 12 wins last week as they knocked No. 9 Iowa State from the unbeaten ranks in emphatic fashion with a 21-point win. Kansas followed that up with an 18-point victory against Baylor. Bill Self's squad went from the bubble of the Coaches Poll at No. 25 all the way to No. 19 in Monday's release. Arizona maintained its spot at No. 1 and is one of three remaining undefeated teams in the country. Another unbeaten, Nebraska, moved up three spots to No. 7 while Miami (Ohio) is three spots outside the Top 25. \nIowa State and Vanderbilt were among that group of undefeated teams last week, but both dropped two games and fell in the Coaches Poll accordingly. The Cyclones dropped seven spots to No. 9 while the Commodores fell from No. 8 to No. 14.Here's a look at the Jan. 19 Coaches Poll in its entirety.First-place votes in parenthesis\nCoaches Poll Arizona (31) Michigan UConnPurdueDukeHoustonNebraskaGonzagaIowa StateMichigan StateIllinoisTexas TechBYUVanderbiltVirginiaFloridaAlabamaClemsonKansasArkansasLouisvilleGeorgiaSaint Louis North Carolina St. John'sOthers receiving votes: Iowa 52; Wisconsin 20; Miami (OH) 19; Utah State 14; Villanova 10; Tennessee 10; Saint Mary's 9; Miami (FL) 8; Texas A&M 5; Kentucky 5; SMU 4; Seton Hall 2; UCF 1; George Mason 1\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Marc Guehi officially completed his move from Crystal Palace to Manchester City on Monday, days after a long-awaited move away from the London club was all but confirmed by Palace's (eventually) outgoing coach Oliver Glasner.City reportedly paid Palace $26.8 million for Guehi's services, according to The Athletic, bringing an end to a months-long saga over his departure. Guehi'd deal with Palace expired at the end of the season, prompting him to pursue a move to Liverpool last summer that eventually collapsed on deadline day when Palace could not secure a replacement. Guehi missed Palace's defeat at Sunderland on Saturday as his transfer to City was being finalized.Guehi immediately provides much-needed depth for City as their busy season continues, especially considering the injuries that Pep Guardiola's side currently have to contend with. Ruben Dias is out with a hamstring issue and John Stones is currently dealing with a thigh injury, each of them expected to return in the coming weeks, while Josko Gvardiol recently underwent surgery for an ankle issue that will keep him out until the spring.Though City are seven points adrift of first place Arsenal in the Premier League, Guardiola's group remain active in the three other competitions they entered at the start of the season -- they advanced to the fourth round of the FA Cup, are currently in the mix for a top eight finish in the UEFA Champions League with two league phase games to go and carry a 2-0 advantage into the second leg of the EFL Cup semifinals against Newcastle United.\nIt is unclear exactly when Guehi will make his debut for City, who have a jam-packed schedule over the next week and change. Guardiola's side return to play on Tuesday for a Champions League fixture at Bodo/Glimt and return home on Saturday for a match against Premier League bottom-dwellers Wolverhampton Wanderers.Manchester City's rebuilding phase continuesCity have now spent roughly $100 million in the January transfer window with Guehi's addition, the bulk of their funds spent on Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth earlier this month. It marks the third straight transfer window in which the club has spent upwards of $100 million on signings, a signal that City are still in the process of restructuring their squad as a batch of veterans departed – and after Guardiola's first trophyless season since his first campaign with the club in 2016-17.The new players have almost entirely been recruited with the hopes of making an immediate impact, especially as City's title charge continues. The Premier League title may be be unlikely at this point but Guardiola's side are one game away from reaching the EFL Cup final, are still in the early stages of an FA Cup run and have excelled enough in the Champions League this season that a title run there cannot be ruled out just yet.\nAs Guardiola introduces one new signing after another, though, it is clear the club are also building with one eye towards the future. Part of their hardships this season have been down to an adjustment period for Guardiola's new vision for the team, the group coming up with enough strong performances over the first half of the campaign to demonstrate that they are on the right track. It is clear, though, that there is still room for improvement – City are still overly reliant on Erling Haaland in attack, for example, his ineffective performance proving costly in their 2-0 defeat to Manchester United on Saturday.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Champions League is back! Oh how we have missed the bright lights of those European nights over the last six weeks. Well miss no longer, because the competition is back for the final two rounds of league fixtures before we really enter into the business of crowning the continent's outstanding team.In perhaps the week's biggest game, Arsenal could potentially wrap up top spot and set themselves on course for the first eight wins from eight season in this new format, but to do so they will have to beat Inter in the San Siro. Their North London rivals don't have such lofty ambitions and Tottenham's clash with Borussia Dortmund is crucial for another reason; winning it might be the only way that Thomas Frank keeps his job. With that and more drama at Real Madrid to look forward to, let's dive into the previews, shall we?1. Arsenal and Inter vie for set piece supremacyIn all likelihood the last obstacle between Arsenal and a 100% record in this season's league phase is the one they will find at the San Siro. Even a heavily rotated team will surely beat Kairat, so if Mikel Arteta wants a weird sort of immortality -- and his decision to bench Bukayo Saka for Saturday's trip to Nottingham Forest suggests he might -- he is going to need to do better than last season's trip to Inter. That 1-0 defeat is a curious game looking back on it. A cagey affair broken open by a set piece at one end amid questions over a penalty at the other, it would barely be more 2025-26 coded if it were posting throwbacks to 2016 on its Instagram stories.Expect much the same this time around too. After all, this game is pitting the dead ball darlings of the Premier League with the outstanding contender from the rest of Europe's top five leagues. Both score lots. Neither concede many at all. \"Arsenal score a lot from set pieces,\" noted Cristian Chivu today, \"but Arsenal should also be worried because we score a lot of them too.\"\nCorners in particular are where these two do their damage. When you add in domestic league play with continental competitions Arsenal lead the way alongside Tottenham for the most goals from corners on 13. One behind them are Inter, whose 12 goals come in no small part because Chivu's side are capable of creating corners for themselves at greater volume than anyone else. Get the ball in the attacking third a lot and you are bound to earn yourself a few chances to whip the ball in.\n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            There are certainly differences between how Inter and Arsenal might approach things when they stand over the corner. The latter have an insistence on inswingers -- only seven of their 153 deliveries in league and Europe have curved away from the goalkeeper --that might seem perverse if it weren't so remorselessly effective. Within the limited parameters they set for themselves Arsenal have plenty of variety, whether it be hitting big Gabriel Magalhaes when he wins his duels or hanging one to the back post for a waiting Leandro Trossard.Inter, meanwhile, deliver more outswingers than in -- in fact they bend it away more than any other team from the top five leagues -- but not by a vast amount. It speaks to how there is a degree more variety and experimentation in the basic form that Angelo Palombo, not quite a full time set piece coach but certainly Inter's lead in that field, has brought to the form. There seems to be a bit more of a mess about, find out approach from the Nerazzuri, one typified in probably the goal of the season so far, Piotr Zielinski's goal of the season contender lock against Verona back in December. Hakan Calhanoglu eschewed the inswinger to drill one to the edge of the box, where Zielinski met it on the run to side foot home.\n\n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            Of course you see the odd goal from a corner that looks like this but usually the player who meets the ball is actually stood on the edge of the box, rather than upping the difficulty level by trying to meet the ball on the run. The vibe is a little bit don't try this at home kids, you'll look very daft. It's not like Inter were testing it out all that often either.\"It came from something we worked on in training yesterday,\" said Zielinski at the time. \"Angelo Palombo pays a lot of attention to these details. He studies other leagues and came up with the idea. We tried it once in training and this was the second time.\" Even Chivu wasn't very happy with the move, only slightly joking afterwards when he said that if it had gone wrong Verona might have hit them on the counterattack.That speaks to a freewheeling approach from Inter that certainly seems to be there when you watch back this season's many corners. Don't overindex it though, an awful lot of those set piece goals come for the same reason Arsenal's do. What unites both teams is that they have players who can deliver the ball on a dime -- Calhanoglu, Federico Di Marco, Declan Rice and Bukayo Saka -- and targets who are almost unstoppable if the deliveries are right. \nThe world and its uncle know how deadly Gabriel is when someone puts a cross in the penalty area. He is one of six players in Europe's top five leagues who has scored four from set pieces in Europe and league play this season. Marcus Thuram has five. It's not too hard to understand why an outstanding 6ft 4in center forward might be getting so many goals when Calhanoglu and Di Marco are crossing the ball for him.If this is a battle of the set pieces, who might win it? Well based on what happens when the mega athletes of the Premier League run into the rest of Europe, there's only one winner. The top five xG creators from non-penalty dead balls in this season's UEFA competitions are Nottingham Forest, Midtjyyland (who along with stablemates Brentford have been set piece pioneers), Crystal Palace, Liverpool and Arsenal. When Liverpool, who have spent 2025-26 in a waking nightmares of corners and long balls, rock up to Eintracht Frankfurt and bully them in the air, you have to assume that the Premier League team are always going to win the battles when the ball goes out of play. Inter might be one of the few for whom that might not be the case.2. Champions League offers little respite for FrankOn this day 12 months ago, a 3-2 defeat at Everton sent Tottenham careening. Fifteenth in the table, their domestic season was effectively over. There were those within the fanbase who had long since lost patience with Ange Postecoglou and viable questions over whether he would be back for the third season in north London but the idea that he might be gone imminently had little wider traction.\nThe same could not be said for Thomas Frank, recipient last week of a public vote of confidence no less dreaded than the Pirate Roberts himself. He will take charge of Tuesday's visit of Borussia Dortmund and might see out a league phase from which Tottenham should qualify. Chief executive Vinai Venkatesham is the sort of leader who wants to give managers every chance possible before dispensing with their services and Frank himself feels the backing of those above him.\"I have just been feeling the trust along the way,\" he said in his pre-match press conference. \"I have said that after every match. I had lunch with Nick [Beucher, co-CEO of owners Tavistock Group], Johan [Lange, sporting director] and Vinai today, so all good. I know it is part of the media circus and the only thing I am focused about is tomorrow.\"As long as we win football matches and make sure we do that, win enough, then everyone will support us.\"\nFrank is right that a win would buy him time but with the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium as mutinous as it was on Saturday's defeat to West Ham, it is hard to shake the sense of a man in a spiral that only a miracle can pull him out of. Supporters don't believe in this style of play and that transmits to players on both sides, only heightening nerves and hindering attempts to build play with a team who lack the tools to progress the ball through midfield.It has been hard for Frank, who has spent the whole season without his two most creative players in James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski. Covering for them is an almighty burden for the undersized Xavi Simons, whose adaptation from the Bundesliga to the Premier League has been both better than might have been feared a few months ago and not really at the level that would be expected from a $70 million signing. Dominic Solanke's minutes have just passed the hour mark. Mixing all that together with a manager who was deliberately hired to bring some post-Postecoglou steel, you would expect a big drop off in output. And yet it's still awful. That Spurs have 48 goals in 31 games is the result of a quite spectacular xG overperfomance. This is a team that cannot get the ball through midfield, that cannot get touches in the box and cannot win the ball up high at any better than an upper mid table level. And there is no evidence that any of this is improving as Frank gets more time to work with what he has.\n\n                                                                    CBS Sports\n                                                            And all that might be a problem for another day if only they were in a different European competition. Frank was right when, three weeks ago, he questioned Spurs' status as a \"Champions League club.\" Even with all the breaks in the world going in their favor, Tottenham are not a team who could win the Champions League. A year ago, they always profiled as one of the favorites to win the Europa League, even when their defense was held together by sellotape and Pedro Porro. That bought Postecoglou the remainder of this season. On current performances, the best case scenario for Frank might be that he gets to round out the league phase, just in case something wild happens to a team already on 11 points. Unless he makes that 17 with a win at Burnley in between, he will remain on borrowed time.3. Are Real Madrid still a favorite?Consider this a paean for the Real Madrid that might have been. Four months ago Xabi Alonso had his team playing arguably the best football in Europe, a team with a clear identity and whose press and possess style allowed them to commit bodies forward while retaining defensive solidity. This was going to be the year that Kylian Mbappe affirmed his status as the best player in the world as Madrid romped to another Champions League title.It still might be. There is no need to relitigate the firing of Alonso and the capitulation to player power that brought it about. Madrid are where they are, with a manager who had previously coached 19 competitive matches with the club's B team, currently in Spain's third tier. Alvaro Arbeloa is in no doubt how things are working from here on out. \"It's my job to tell the players what to do, and if they don't do it, it's because I didn't explain it well, so it's my fault,\" he said last week.\nYeah...\n        \n            \n                Jurgen Klopp reiterates disinterest in Real Madrid job: 'I don't want to be somewhere else'\n                \n                    Pardeep Cattry                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAnyway, you're all thinking about Carlo Ancelotti now, aren't you? The great rejoinder to the suggestion that Madrid can't just vibe their way to the Champions League is that the old boss was all about liberating his players to play their way and watching the trophies roll in. Of course Ancelotti had a better grasp of Bernabeu kremlinology than Alonso but to frame his success in such a fashion is to betray a knowledge of his work that barely extends beyond the memes of him eyebrow raised or celebrating with a cigar.A good times curator is not the sort who alights on Jude Bellingham as the solution to Madrid's lack of a striker. Ancelotti found a way for Vinicius Junior and Mbappe to both occupy the left flank to relative success last season too. Ancelotti adapts to what he has but, as Gareth Bale found out during their time in Madrid, he will not throw out his system midseason to indulge the needs of one player.It is of course too soon after one league game and that cup exit at the hands of Albacete to know if Arbeloa is prepared to be so tolerant. The evidence we have -- both his comments and a second half against Levante that looked rather like Jude Bellingham as one man midfield while four attackers hung about up top -- encourages one to fear the worst. And if that proves to be the case then it is hard to believe that Madrid can be the inner circle contenders they looked like being so recently.\n            ",

    "body": "\nAfter an incredible divisional round that started and ended with overtime classics, we're left with four NFL teams vying to be Super Bowl champions in the Broncos, Patriots, Seahawks and Rams. The matchups give us two interesting angles, one involving part three of a divisional rivalry that this year started with a defensive slugfest and then gave us an overtime shootout to lay out the path to the No. 1 seed for Seattle. The other features an MVP candidate at QB who has struggled against top defenses in the postseason facing another, though in a much different QB matchup than we were expecting.We'll get into both games a bit more as I use my power ratings to project where I would set the spread for each, but first we need to talk about the difference between Bo Nix and Jarrett Stidham when it comes to rating the Broncos. When a team turns to a backup, a rating adjustment will typically follow in the market. In some cases there may not be a perceived difference between QBs, particularly if a struggling starter is outright benched, and the adjustment to the line will be little to nothing. In the other extreme, a player like Lamar Jackson going from projected starter to out can cause an adjustment as high as 10 points depending on the quality of the backup.Typically, I'm reserving adjustments of seven points or higher to elite-level QBs like Jackson, Josh Allen and Patrick Mahomes, and the size of the adjustment will depend on my faith in the backup. Mahomes to Gardner Minshew and Mahomes to Chris Oladokun are two very different scenarios for moving a line. If I see the fill-in starter as a potential disaster -- and we've seen a few of those this year -- I may push an adjustment just inside that 7-10 point window for a good but not elite QB. Knowing what we know now, you can make an argument for a seven-point adjustment from Mahomes to Minshew and then another seven-point adjustment from Minshew to Oladokun, moving the Chiefs from one of the highest rated teams to one of the lowest in two moves.That brings us to this particular situation with the Broncos. Nix is not near that elite tier for me, although he has come up big in late game situations. He's put the team on his back at times this season, but too often the Broncos offense has lacked the juice to put away bad opponents, leaving them in a lot of competitive games late even against opponents like the Jets and Raiders. I think it's fair to put him mid-range and make him a four-point improvement over a generic QB, and part of that is due to Sean Payton being in place to elevate whoever gets the start at quarterback on a week-to-week basis.Then we come to Stidham, a career backup whose claim to fame has been starting the final two games of two straight seasons in place of big-name QBs the team wanted to keep healthy in order to have no issues parting ways with them in the offseason. He played very well in his first start, taking the Raiders to overtime and throwing three TDs in a 37-34 overtime loss to a 49ers team that finished the year first in points allowed, but he struggled in his next start against the Chiefs. Cleaning up for the Broncos a year later, he won a low-scoring game against the Chargers and then got outplayed by Aidan O'Connell and his former team in the finale.What I'm getting from that track record is that Stidham is an inconsistent QB who is not as bad as many of the backups we've seen forced into action this year, and on a good day he can play well enough to beat anybody. I'm comfortable making him a midrange backup on this profile with more potential to surprise on the high end than the low end, which is what we could generally say about Nix when rating him among starters. My ratings actually had a Broncos -2.5 projection prior to the divisional round as I had the Patriots as a half-point better but the Broncos getting three points for home-field advantage. I'm moving the Broncos 4.5 points with the QB change, and when coupled with a slight adjustment upward for New England, it means the best I can do is move the game to Patriots -2.5.The sportsbooks and betting market felt differently. The Broncos opened as 4.5-point underdogs on Sunday, a six-point adjustment that is already either getting Nix close to that top tier of MVP candidates or Stidham down to the Trey Lance level of \"this probably isn't going to go very well.\" The market then bet the Patriots up to 5.5, even touching 6 at some books on Sunday night. That's getting to level of Mahomes to Minshew or Minshew to Oladokun, and you can judge for yourself if either of those is a comparable gap to Nix vs. Stidham. I'm almost certainly going to be on the 'dog here, and we'll get into that more below.I'll have my picks this week at SportsLine, where members are able to access all my picks as they're made throughout the week and hopefully take advantage of some good line value. For now, let's dive into our betting power ratings and then take a look at what the spread should be for both conference title games.Conference championship power ratingsTeam2120191817LAR887.57.57.5SEA87.5777NE6.56555DEN1   5.5544Taking a break from the AFC, I now have the two NFC finalists as dead even after a strong performance by the Seahawks offense. You could certainly give them the overall edge after the Rams offense struggled against a questionable Bears defense, and to do that I think you'd have to be sure Sam Darnold isn't a concern in big spots any longer. He didn't exactly get tested in the divisional round, watching the opening kickoff get returned for a touchdown and then completing 12 passes in a game that felt over by the end of the first quarter.The Rams offense managed just 4.4 yards per play on the road against the Bears, and they certainly have seemed out of their element in the outdoor conditions in the first two rounds despite gutting out two wins. Matthew Stafford completed less than half of his pass attempts in the win, and he's going to have to be a lot better on Sunday for the Rams to advance.The Patriots get another bump from me despite the offense's struggles, as I think it's abundantly clear the defense is in a much better spot than it was for most of the season. While Drake Maye and Co. have not risen to the challenge of facing elite defenses after many questioned the ease of their schedule in the regular season, the defense has stepped up and then some.Then we have the Broncos, and we talked about my ratings adjustment above. Making them a +1 team puts them 11th among the 14 playoff teams, including everyone who is eliminated but who received ratings adjustments after their final games. I'd definitely take the Broncos over the Panthers (-1) and Steelers (0), and I moved the 49ers without George Kittle down to zero as well. Are the Broncos in a worse place than those teams heading into this game? Could I potentially have them too low putting them behind a Texans squad that got horrendous play from its QB and a Chargers team with major offensive line issues that couldn't be papered over against a good defense? Are we sure this team wouldn't be a coin flip on a neutral field with the Packers or maybe even the Bears?Let's take a quick look at each game's spread projection.Patriots at Broncos\nIn order for a line of Patriots -6 to make sense to me, you'd have to make the Broncos an average team without Bo Nix, give them just two points of home-field advantage, then put the Patriots on level in my ratings with the Seahawks and Rams. I can't do any of those things, so I see a lot of value backing the Broncos really at anything above 3.5.That becomes even more of a key number in this situation of a home underdog in the playoffs. Heading into this postseason, home underdogs of four points or more were 9-0 ATS over the last 50 years, combining three straight close losses from 2012-20 with six outright wins from 1976 to 2011.I pounded the table for the Panthers as 10.5-point underdogs in the wild card round for this reason, saying that these perceived bad teams outperform expectations consistently in the playoffs with everything on the line and the prospect of their season ending. I was told that this time is different, that the Rams were really good and the Panthers were really bad, as if the other situations when a team was laying more than a touchdown on the road in the playoffs didn't have the same perception.Once the spread got up to four against the Bears this past week, I backed the home team again. This one came close to being the streak ender before Caleb Williams unleashed one of the best passes in the history of postseason football to send the game into OT, where the Rams won but didn't cover. That makes the home 'dogs of four or more 11-0 against the spread heading into this matchup.What would be the situation where the Broncos could cover or even win this game? Could it be an elite defense shutting down an offense that has not been in good form and reducing the impact of poor quarterback play? How often do we see that happen?My spread for this game is Patriots -2.5.Rams at Seahawks\nHeading into the start of the week, this feels like a game where you could argue any range of spreads. The Seahawks probably have to be favored at home after a dominant win over the 49ers while the Rams barely survived in overtime, but what about the first two meetings in this matchup would give you confidence laying points with either team considering how close each was?I think the easiest thing to do -- and, in fact, what I've done -- is to say these are two even teams and then make the spread whatever you give Seattle for home-field advantage. The defense is playing at a high level, giving up a total of 548 yards in its last three games combined, which all came against playoff teams (Panthers and the 49ers twice). But the game prior the defense allowed 587 yards to these Rams in Seattle in an overtime game won by the Seahawks' decision to go for two and execute. The Rams turned the ball over three times in that one and still nearly won.The spread for that shootout in Seattle was Seahawks -1.5, so moving this spread to 2.5 must either mean the Seahawks have gotten better since that game or the Rams have gotten worse. I'd chalk the point of line movement up to Stafford not looking 100% these last few weeks, but we'll see if he can look more like the QB in the previous meeting as that will probably determine which of these teams is representing the NFC in the Super Bowl.My spread for this game is Seahawks -2.5.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Indiana will be looking to cap one of the most remarkable turnarounds in college sports history as the No. 1 seed Hoosiers take on No. 10 seed Miami on Monday in the College Football Playoff National Championship. A win would make IU the first-ever 16-0 college football team and vault second-year coach Curt Cignetti to mythical status for his work in bringing the previously irrelevant Hoosiers to life.With Heisman-winning quarterback Fernando Mendoza and a fierce defense leading the way, Indiana pummeled Alabama and Oregon in its first two CFP games, winning by 35 and 34, to reach this point. Taking down a physically imposing Miami team could be a more significant challenge.While the Hurricanes enter as an underdog, they have the advantage of playing on their home field inside Hard Rock Stadium. For fourth-year coach Mario Cristobal, a former national-title winning Miami offensive lineman, this represents a unique opportunity to return the 'Canes to the top of college football. He's already guided Miami past better-seeded foes Texas A&M, Ohio State and Ole Miss during a magical CFP run. Given that the Hurricanes squeaked into the field as the final at-large selection, they have already surpassed expectations.\nKeys to victory in CFP National Championship: How Indiana can win | How Miami can winNow comes the grand finale of the 2025-26 college football season. Will it be Indiana or Miami as the last team standing on Monday night?Where to watch Indiana vs. Miami liveDate: Monday, Jan. 19 | Time: 7:30 p.m. ETLocation: Hard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, FloridaTV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nIndiana vs. Miami: Alternate viewing optionsField Pass with Pat McAfee Show -- ESPN2, fuboTV (Try for free)Film Room -- ESPNU, fuboTV (Try for free)Skycast -- ESPNEWS, fuboTV (Try for free)Field Pass with ACC Huddle  -- ACC Network, fuboTV (Try for free)All-22 with ESPN Radio, High Skycast, Command Center, hometown radio, halftime band performances and more available via ESPN's appIndiana vs. Miami: Players to watchFernando Mendoza, QB, Indiana: Indiana has been a dominant team, yes. It's also been a clutch team. Tight regular season wins over Iowa, Oregon and Penn State required a heroic touch from Mendoza, as did the Big Ten Championship Game victory over Ohio State. In each instance, the Miami native led clutch, late-game scoring drives to keep the Hoosiers unbeaten. He's a precisely accurate passer, deceptively mobile runner and the unflappable leader for IU.Carson Beck, QB, Miami: Beck rewrote his college football legacy by leading a pair of late touchdown drives in Miami's Fiesta Bowl win over Ole Miss. The Georgia transfer capped the performance with a go-ahead touchdown run with 18 seconds remaining. His career -- and his 2025 season -- has featured ups and downs. But after a season-ending elbow injury in last year's SEC Championship Game and subsequent public divorce with Georgia, the sixth-year senior is entering his final game on a high note.Elijah Sarratt, WR, Indiana: With four touchdown grabs over the course of Indiana's three postseason games, Sarratt is up to 15 for the season. That tally would likely be even higher if not for hamstring injury that forced him to miss two games. The 6-foot-2 senior is a sturdy target on the outside who uses his physicality to box out corners and rise above them for big plays. He is among the contingent of players who followed Indiana coach Curt Cignetti from James Madison after the 2023 season.\nMalachi Toney, WR, Miami: Miami's freshman speedster was just a three-star prospect and the No. 55 overall receiver in the Class of 2025, per 247Sports. But it was clear from the jump that the Hurricanes identified a gem from their own backyard in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Toney earned first-team All-ACC honors and is set to surpass 100 receptions in the title game. Offensive coordinator Shannon Dawson has done a great job of scheming up ways to get Toney the football. Once he gets it, watch out.D'Angelo Ponds, CB, Indiana: Ponds opened up Indiana's CFP semifinal win over Oregon with a pick six on the first play from scrimmage. The James Madison transfer has been a game-changer in the secondary all season, earning second-team All-American honors from CBS Sports. He's only 5-foot-9, but Ponds' draft stock is on the rise amid a strong finish to his junior season.Rueben Bain Jr., EDGE, Miami: Bain is a high-motor edge rusher who ranks No. 3 in the CBS Sports NFL Draft Prospect Rankings. He enters the title game with 8.5 sacks and 13 tackles for loss. Combine him with Akheem Mesidor and you get arguably the nastiest 1-2 pass-rushing punch in college football. The Miami native has been a critical building block in the program's foundation under Cristobal and will be a challenge for Indiana to contain.\nIndiana vs. Miami prediction, pick \nMiami's offensive line is strong enough to keep Indiana's defensive front from wreaking total havoc, which is going to be critical if the Hurricanes want to keep it close. Conversely, Miami has enough juice with its defensive front — led by Rueben Bain Jr. and Akeem Mesidor — to at least make the Hoosiers sweat. In the end, IU appears to be a team of destiny and should win the game outright. With Heisman Trophy winning quarterback Fernando Mendoza leading the charge, Indiana appears to be the better team. But don't dismiss Miami's ability to make it a battle. Prediction: Miami +8.5\n            ",

    "body": "\n        When Fernando Mendoza walks off the field of the College Football Playoff National Championship on Monday, it's expected to be his final time in an Indiana jersey. Mendoza put together one of the greatest transfer seasons in college football history, a Heisman Trophy campaign leading to the national title game. It was an unbelievable rise for the former two-star quarterback, and should end with his name called first in the 2026 NFL Draft. However, Indiana already has its eyes on its future at the position. And like Mendoza, he is another underdog story. Josh Hoover has always been a little different. From the time he was a sophomore in high school, he carried himself like a politician or CEO, complete with the strong handshake. Despite playing at heralded Heath High School in Rockwall, Texas, Hoover was named a team captain as a sophomore, an honor he carried all three years on varsity. \n\"He's just the real deal in every form, not just his ability,\" Hoover's high school coach Mike Spradlin told CBS Sports. \"He loves football, he loves teammates, he loves coaches, I'm serious. He loves looking at film, loves playing the game. It's not something where he's just trying to get to the next thing, he genuinely loves ball and raises that expectation level for those around him.\" \n        \n            \n                Indiana QB Fernando Mendoza looks to join elite group as both Heisman winner, CFP national champion\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHoover was originally headed to Hoosiers before signing with TCULike many during the pandemic recruiting process, Hoover was largely overlooked out of high school. He ranked as the No. 42 quarterback in the Class of 2022 and largely lacked major college offers. Ironically, he committed to Tom Allen's staff at Indiana initially -- because the Hoosiers were among his only power offers. When Sonny Dykes moved from SMU to TCU, he offered Hoover to follow. Ultimately, Hoover took the chance to play in the Big 12 and stay close to home. \nFrom the day he got on campus, Hoover impressed with his work ethic and dedication, even as he sat behind two older quarterbacks. Hoover watched up close as Heisman runner-up Max Duggan led the Frogs to the national title game in 2022. Chandler Morris was slated to be the starting quarterback in 2023. However, Morris suffered injuries, clearing the way for the redshirt freshman Hoover to get on the field. Ultimately, he never left, emerging as a rising star in the sport. In 36 appearances for the Horned Frogs, Hoover completed 65% of his passes for 9,629 yards, 71 touchdowns and 33 interceptions. His 8.4 yards per attempt last season led the Big 12. As a junior, he threw for 3,472 yards and 29 touchdowns while leading the Horned Frogs to a second consecutive nine-win season. \n\"We say it all the time, playing football is about being in the right place at the right time,\" Dykes told CBS Sports in September. \"It's really that simple. Now some guys do it by just running past people, some people do it with technique. The flashy guys are the speed guys, but the other guys are sometimes just as effective. It just doesn't look as easy.\" \nBloomington becoming a hot destination for QBsAfter their success with Mendoza and Kurtis Rourke before, Indiana has become perhaps the top destination for transfer quarterbacks. Hoover is rated the No. 10 quarterback, rated well but not among the elite. However, Hoover checks many of the boxes of Indiana's top transfer successes. For one, he has a tremendous amount of film. Hoover's 1,183 returning pass attempts ranks near the top of the sport. \nThe piece that Indiana will have to cement is decision-making. Hoover is calm and collected in the pocket, but frankly, too much was asked of him at TCU. He threw more than 30 pass attempts nine times in 12 games. Mendoza only did so twice, and once was the FCS opener as he built chemistry with his teammates. On that level of volume, Hoover threw 24 interceptions over the past two seasons. Offensive coordinator Mike Shanahan could be a perfect mentor to get Hoover back on schedule and elevate him into a top NFL Draft pick. In Shanahan's offense, Mendoza had an interception rate of only 1.7% while his touchdown rate jumped from 4.1% to 11.6%. Indiana is set to play for a national championship on Monday. Like at TCU, Hoover is set to take over for a Heisman finalist quarterback who played in the national title game, from Duggan to Mendoza. According to those around him, he embraces that. \n\"He's special,\" Spradlin said. \"I've been fortunate in my career to get to coach some really special kids, but he's certainly at the top of the list. He's the real deal, not only a great athlete, but a great kid, great leader, great person… he's not interested in all his stats and those things. He's a winner. He's a winner.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Another lopsided schedule this week, as we edge even closer to the trade deadline, which will be closely followed by the All-Star break. Coming off a five-game week for the Lakers, this time around it's Miami's turn, while Orlando and Portland will go around just twice. That leaves 16 teams with four games and 11 teams with three games. Sitting players who only go two or three times has its advantages, but fantasy managers still have to make smart decisions when figuring out whom to play, regardless of game count. Being aware of back-to-back sets is also a key factor, especially with so many teams now sitting players due to injury management.Five Games: MIAFour Games: BKN, BOS, CLE, DAL, DEN, DET, GSW, LAC, MIL, OKC, PHI, PHO, SAC, SAS, TOR, UTAThree Games: ATL, CHA, CHI, HOU, IND, LAL, MEM, MIN, NOP, NYK, WASTwo Games: ORL, PORHere are four potential starts and four potential sits entering the 14th week of the NBA season.

If you play in a rotisserie league, the number of games played each week may not matter in your format.\nGuardsConsider starting: Egor Demin, BKNOpponents: PHO, @NYK, BOS, @LACAlthough Demin's playing time continues to fluctuate, for the most part, he has been at least close to starter-level minutes. In 12 games over the past month, he has averaged 13.8 points, 2.8 rebounds, 3.4 assists, 3.6 three-pointers, and 0.9 steals in 26.9 minutes per game, good enough for top 100 value in standard leagues. Brooklyn will almost certainly continue to focus on its youth, of which Demin is a huge part. While it won't all be beer and skittles, four games of Demin should be enough to get it done in most formats this week.Consider starting: Brice Sensabaugh, UTAOpponents: @SAS, MIN, SAS, MIATo say that Sensabaugh has been on one of late would be an understatement. He has now scored at least 25 points in four of the past four games, including a career-high 43-point explosion against the Bulls. As we know, nothing is guaranteed when it comes to Utah's nightly rotation, which adds an element of risk for anyone rostering Sensabaugh. With that said, he has played at least 28 minutes in six of the past seven games, apparently earning more trust when compared to the start of the season. If you are looking for a boost in points and threes, Sensabaugh might be the man for the job, with four games over the next seven days.Consider sitting: Jrue Holiday, POROpponents: MIA, TORHoliday recently returned from a lengthy absence as a result of a calf injury and has provided serviceable numbers since. However, it is clear that Portland is going to take a cautious approach, having limited him to no more than 21 minutes in all four games post-injury. Not only does Portland have two games this week, but they also happen to fall on consecutive days, meaning there is a very real chance Holiday is limited to one game in the next seven days. Factoring in all the limitations, moving Holiday to your bench seems like a no-brainer.\nForwardsConsider starting: Pelle Larsson, MIAOpponents: @GSW, @SAC, @POR, @UTA, @PHOLarsson's numbers have been wildly inconsistent over the past two weeks, making him a tough sell for anyone considering him as a starting option. Five games on the slate certainly work in his favor, so there is that. Despite his production being up and down, he has played at least 27 minutes in four straight games, two of which ended with 16-point performances. This is clearly a case of quantity over quality, although we have seen glimpses of quality throughout the season. If your other options play two or three games this week, five games of Larsson should at least be on the table as an option for you.Consider sitting: Toumani Camara, POROpponents: MIA, TORWhile there have been some positive moments thus far this season, Camara has been largely disappointing, currently sitting outside the top 170 in standard leagues. With averages of 12.9 points, 5.0 rebounds, 2.6 assists, 1.0 steals, and 2.5 three-pointers, the main issue is that he doesn't really help you in any one category. In fact, the only category that rates as a positive is three-pointers, a category that is easily streamable in a lot of leagues. As a starter playing upwards of 30 minutes on most nights, he warrants a roster spot in most leagues. However, two games this week are simply not enough to get the job done.Consider sitting: Saddiq Bey, NOPOpponents: DET, @MEM, @SASSomewhat surprisingly, Bey has been able to maintain a significant role in New Orleans. In 38 appearances, he has averaged 15.1 points, 5.7 rebounds, 0.8 steals, and 1.6 three-pointers in 29.9 minutes per game. However, with Zion Williamson now healthy, Bey's numbers have changed slightly when it comes to fantasy value. While his points have remained relatively consistent, his contributions in the peripherals have regressed, averaging four rebounds, 0.5 steals, and 1.2 3-pointers in four games over the past week. Unless you are simply needing points, shifting Bey to your bench with only three games this week is definitely a viable option.\nCentersConsider starting: Moussa Cisse, DALOpponents: @NYK, GSW, LAL, @MILThis one comes with a lot of risk, although it also comes with a sneaky amount of upside. Anthony Davis is done for the foreseeable future, while Daniel Gafford continues to deal with ongoing ankle issues. Currently on a two-way deal, Cisse's availability is likely to remain on a game-to-game basis, another factor that has to be considered when determining his place on your roster. However, over his past two games, Cisse has averaged 9.5 points, 11.5 rebounds, and 1.5 blocks in just 22.5 minutes per game. If you are in a position to absorb some risk, Cisse makes for an intriguing play this week.Consider sitting: Jay Huff, INDOpponents: @PHI, @BOS, @OKCThe center rotation in Indiana continues to ebb and flow, as highlighted by Huff's recent playing time. In four games over the past week, Huff logged 13, 29, 16, and 28 minutes, making his fantasy value almost impossible to project. Having Isaiah Jackson back in the fold also complicated matters, bringing the number of viable center options to four. With so many teams playing four times this week, three games of Huff could end up being one or two games in which he actually plays meaningful minutes.\n            ",

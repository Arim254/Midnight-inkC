    "body": "\n        There's no more maneuvering either side. No. 4 Georgia and No. 23 Georgia Tech know exactly where they stand in their respective conference championship races, which makes Friday's meeting in Atlanta less about postseason paths and more about something simpler: taking a swing at your rival. Georgia can still tighten its grip on a first-round bye in the College Football Playoff, a margin that could matter in December. Georgia Tech doesn't have that luxury -- even a win here likely won't push the Yellow Jackets into at-large range, leaving the ACC title game as their only real doorway into the 12-team bracket.  What this matchup does offer is history, and plenty of it. The 119th edition of Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate marks just the third time in series history that both teams enter the rivalry with at least nine wins. The last time these two sides met, they played one of the wildest games of the 2024 season: an eight-overtime marathon in Athens that ended 44-42 and reset the bar for chaos in a rivalry that rarely needs help generating it.Now they get a neutral-site stage at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta with a chance to settle something that analytics and résumés can't. This one is about bragging rights, plain and simple.  Georgia vs. Georgia Tech: Need to know  Heisman-caliber QBs: While a trip to New York for either seems unlikely at this point, Georgia's Gunner Stockton and Georgia Tech's Haynes King are the engines of two high-powered offenses. Both have accounted for 27 total touchdowns this season, tied for 18th among all FBS players. King's dual-threat ability stands out, averaging 339.9 total yards per game -- second-most in FBS -- while Stockton has been equally efficient through the air. Both quarterbacks rank in the top 10 nationally in completion percentage, with King at 71.8% and Stockton at 71.4%, making them two of the most productive and precise signal-callers in the country.Dominant Dawgs: Since 2021, Georgia has gone 63-6, capturing back-to-back CFP national titles and two SEC championships along the way. Under Kirby Smart, the Bulldogs are 42-3 against nonconference opponents and have won seven straight against Georgia Tech. A victory Friday would extend that streak to eight, tying the Yellow Jackets' longest uninterrupted run in the series from 1949-1956.\nWandering eyes: Friday's result won't change the conference races -- Georgia already has its SEC path mostly set, while Georgia Tech's ACC title hopes hinge on a complex chain of other results. For the Bulldogs, a win simply allows them to turn their focus to the SEC title game and the College Football Playoff, hoping for a loss from either Alabama or Texas A&M to secure a return trip to Atlanta next week. For the Yellow Jackets, the path is far trickier: scenarios include a Pittsburgh win plus SMU and Virginia losses, OR a Miami victory combined with Duke, NC State, SMU and Virginia losses.

Georgia has extended its win streak to seven games, while Georgia Tech has dropped two of its last three, watching its CFP hopes slip away. The Bulldogs' defense has been dominant against Power Four opponents over the last three contests, allowing just 17 points per game and 3.11 yards per carry. Georgia Tech, by contrast, is 3-2 in games where it averages fewer than five yards per rush, with a combined -13 point margin in those contests. Pick: Georgia -13.5\n\n                    \n    \n

    "body": "\nEthan Dietz, a basketball player at Connors State College in Warner, Oklahoma, died Tuesday after sustaining an injury in the second half of his team's game against Grayson College on Saturday. Specifics about the injury were not disclosed in the school's announcement, but a Connors State spokesperson told multiple outlets that Dietz sustained a head injury in the game. \"The Cowboy family has suffered an unimaginable loss,\" the school said in a statement. \"As you know, sophomore Ethan Dietz was injured during a men's basketball game on Saturday. He passed away this morning, November 25. Ethan exemplified what it means to be a Cowboy, to value hard work and being part of a team. While the team and the Cowboy community are processing our own grief, our hearts go out to his family and friends.\"\nDietz, a sophomore from Conway, Arkansas, played 20 minutes in the game prior to his injury and scored six points and hauled in four rebounds. The 6-foot-8 forward was a starter for the Cowboys who averaged 11 points and 9.4 rebounds per game on the season. Dietz also started 29 of the Cowboys' 36 games last year as a freshman.\"Ethan Dietz was the kind of player a coach always hopes for,\" Connors State coach and athletic director Bill Muse said. \"He was talented athletically and academically and he understood the importance of hard work. If you ever saw him smile, you knew he was all heart. He was a person of character as well as a great teammate. Our hearts and prayers continue to be with Ethan's family, friends and our team as we process this heartbreaking loss.\"Connors State canceled its upcoming games against Southern Arkansas University Tech on Wednesday, Nov. 26 and against Grayson College on Monday, Dec. 1 in the wake of the tragedy. The women's basketball team also canceled its next two games.\"It is devastating when such a bright light is taken from us,\" Connors State president Dr. Ron Ramming said. \"Ethan exemplified what it means to be a Cowboy, to value hard work and being part of a team. While we are processing our own grief, our hearts go out to his family, friends and teammates.\"Connors State will hold an on-campus vigil in Dietz's honor on Monday, Dec. 1 at 7 p.m.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        No. 16 Texas hosts No. 3 Texas A&M in a fierce rivalry game at Darrell K. Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium in Austin. The Longhorns try to keep their College Football Playoff hopes alive after moving to 8-3 after a dynamic victory against Arkansas. Texas A&M has blazed out to a historic 11-0 start for the first time since 1992. The last time the Aggies won 10 games was 2012, the year Johnny Manziel won the Heisman Trophy. In their most recent SEC game, Texas A&M overcame a 30-3 halftime deficit to shock South Carolina 31-30 to stay unbeaten and virtually clinch a spot in the College Football Playoff. Texas has not hosted this rivalry game since 2010, a 24-17 victory for Texas A&M. However, the Longhorns took down the Aggies 17-7 in the return of the rivalry last year at Kyle Field. Emotions will be high for the return to Austin.   Texas vs. Texas A&M: Need to know  Breakout pass rusher: Texas A&M lost multiple defensive linemen to the NFL last season. However, Cashius Howell has stepped up and emerged as one of the best in the sport. The former Bowling Green transfer was a rotation player last season, but has since emerged to lead the SEC with 11.5 sacks. Amazingly, he has recorded a sack in seven of his eight Power Four games. Against a Texas offensive line dealing with major issues, Howell can change the game. Resurgent Arch: Texas quarterback Arch Manning had a slow start to the year as he acclimated to the job of being QB1, but has found his footing in the second half of the year. Manning now has four straight games of completing more than 60% of his passes with 13 touchdowns to only two interceptions. Texas is 3-1 in those games. Against Arkansas, he became the first Texas QB to score touchdowns via pass, rush and receiving in one game. Texas A&M will be a substantially tougher challenge, but Manning is playing his best ball. \nStrength on weakness: Despite coming into the year with a highly-rated defense, Texas' secondary has been a major liability. In SEC play, the Longhorns rank last in the conference in passing defense, surrendering more than 295 yards per game. Over the last four games, they're giving up 325 passing yards per game. Texas A&M boasts the SEC's best receiving corps behind standouts Mario Craver and KC Concepcion. The Longhorns will have their hands full.   Where to watch Texas vs. Texas A&M live  Date: Friday, Nov. 28 | Time: 7:30 p.m. ET  Location: Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium -- Austin, Texas  TV: ABC | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)  Texas vs. Texas A&M prediction, picks  From a matchup perspective, Texas A&M clearly has the upper hand. Their passing offense will gave Texas' defense fits. Top pass rusher Cashius Howell is a matchup nightmare against an inconsistent Longhorns offensive line. Even their special teams has created opportunities. But in a rivalry game of this magnitude, it will be a mental game above all. Mike Elko's squad has stepped up in the biggest moments, and they will do the same to clinch their first spot in the SEC Championship Game and finish 12-0. Pick: Texas A&M -2.5\n\n

    "body": "\n        Some quality Week 13 NFL betting advice would be to consider anything and everything before placing Week 13 NFL predictions. How teams perform versus the spread on a short week is pertinent for this week's slate, as are how teams perform in adverse conditions or with lengthy travel, which are also relevant with this week's NFL schedule. A dome team in Atlanta has to travel to NYC to face the Jets, as the former may have to deal with the elements. Meanwhile, the Rams, who are the biggest favorites per the Week 13 NFL odds at -10.5, will have to travel cross country to Carolina for a 1 p.m. ET Sunday kickoff.Those are things outside of the NFL spread records one should consider before laying down any wagers. Along with the Rams, other double-digit favorites include the Seahawks (-11.5) versus the Vikings and the Chargers (-10) against the Raiders. The heavily favored teams feature the likes of Matthew Stafford, Kyren Williams, Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Justin Herbert who could factor into NFL player props, plugged into Fantasy football lineups or be a part of your NFL DFS strategy.

The offensive issues are a legitimate concern, but Chicago is not stout enough defensively to stop Jalen Hurts & Co., especially with the team at its peak motivation coming off the terrible Dallas loss.\" See Silverstein's full analysis here.SportsLine's self-learning AI, which has hit more than 2,000 4.5- and 5-star prop picks since the start of the 2023 NFL season, projects Bears WR Rome Odunze to go Under 3.5 receptions (+110). SportsLine AI forecasts Odunze to have 2.2 receptions in a prop pick rated 5 stars. Get more picks from SportsLine AI here.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Week 14 on CBS Sports Network closes out the regular season with a slate loaded with championship implications, postseason drama and long-running regional stakes. Several conferences enter the weekend with crowded races at the top, and every kickoff has the potential to reshape who plays for titles as November winds down.The action begins Friday with a pair of midday showdowns. Kent State looks to finish a resurgent season on a high note, while Northern Illinois aims to preserve a home dominance in the series. Later, San Diego State travels to New Mexico in one of the weekend's most consequential games: a win sends San Diego State to the Mountain West Championship Game, while New Mexico needs both a victory and outside help to host the league finale for the first time in program history.You can bet college football games this week at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager. Click here:Saturday opens in the MAC, where Miami (OH) continues its push for a third straight trip to the conference title game but still needs both a win and favorable results elsewhere. Later in the afternoon, Kennesaw State has a chance to reach the Conference USA Championship Game in just its second FBS season, heading to Liberty for a matchup that carries revenge potential after last year's meeting flipped the league narrative.\nThe nightcap features a rivalry with Mountain West stakes attached, as UNLV seeks both a win and multiple results across the conference to earn another shot at the league crown. Nevada, meanwhile, enters on its best stretch of the season and looks to spoil those hopes in Reno.CBS Sports Network will carry all five games, with full viewing info, betting lines and key storylines to follow as Week 14 unfolds.All times Eastern | Odds via SportsLine consensusKent State vs. Northern IllinoisDate: Friday, Nov. 28 | Time: 12 p.m.Location: Brigham Field at Huskie Stadium -- DeKalb, IllinoisTV: CBS Sports Network [Channel finder] Live stream: CBSSports.com | Mobile: CBS Sports AppSpread: Northern Illinois -4.5 | Will the Huskies cover? Check out SportsLine's Week 14 projections here\nIt's been a successful season by program standards for Kent State (4-7), with Mark Carney opening the 2025 campaign under interim status before earning the full-time job in October after delivering its first win since 2023 and first FBS victory since 2022. The Golden Flashes can't reach a bowl, but they can still close strong with another MAC road win Friday at Northern Illinois (3-8). The Huskies haven't lost to Kent State in DeKalb since 1966, taking each of the last 12 meetings at home.San Diego State vs. New MexicoDate: Friday, Nov. 28 | Time: 12 p.m.Location: University Stadium -- Albuquerque, New MexicoTV: CBS Sports Network [Channel finder] Live stream: CBSSports.com | Mobile: CBS Sports AppSpread: San Diego State -1.5 | Will the Aztecs cover? Check out SportsLine's Week 14 projections hereIt's win-and-in for San Diego State (9-2) and its path to the Mountain West title game. For New Mexico (8-3), it needs a win and a Boise State loss. The Lobos would host the conference championship if they get in, with an opportunity to claim a league title for the first time since 1964 as co-champions of the Western Athletic Conference. Under first-year coach Jason Eck, New Mexico has won five consecutive conference games -- its longest Mountain West streak since 2004 -- but now faces a San Diego State defense that allows just 11.6 points per game -- tied for second nationally.\nBall State vs. Miami (Ohio)Date: Saturday, Nov. 29 | Time: 12 p.m.Location: Fred C.

Check out SportsLine's Week 14 projections hereMiami (6-5) ended a two-game skid last week to keep its hopes of reaching the MAC Championship Game for the third consecutive season alive. The RedHawks need another win against Ball State (4-7) and a loss from either Buffalo, Toledo or Western Michigan to secure a return trip to Detroit. The Cardinals own just one win in the past nine meetings against Miami with the most recent victory in Oxford coming in 2012.Kennesaw State vs. LibertyDate: Saturday, Nov. 29 | Time: 3:30 p.m.Location: Williams Stadium -- Lynchburg, VirginiaTV: CBS Sports Network [Channel finder] Live stream: CBSSports.com | Mobile: CBS Sports AppSpread: Kennesaw State -2.5 | Will the Owls cover? Check out SportsLine's Week 14 projections here\nKennesaw State (8-3) can punch its ticket to the C-USA Championship Game with a win at Liberty (4-7) on Saturday. In just their second year as an FBS member, the Owls are on the verge of playing for hardware with bowl eligibility already secured. The Flames' run of six straight bowl appearances has already come to an end after dropping three consecutive games. Liberty fell in back-to-back overtime contests on the road before returning for its home finale, where it gets a shot at payback after Kennesaw State snapped an 11-game winning streak against Conference USA opponents last season.UNLV vs. NevadaDate: Saturday, Nov. 29 | Time: 9 p.m.Location: Mackay Stadium -- Reno, NevadaTV: CBS Sports Network [Channel finder] Live stream: CBSSports.com | Mobile: CBS Sports AppSpread: UNLV -7.5 | Will the Rebels cover?

The Rebels must win at Nevada (3-8) -- which has won back-to-back games for the first time since 2023 -- as well as losses by both Boise State and New Mexico. Quarterback Anthony Colandrea has powered the offense through a late-season surge, producing nine total touchdowns over the past three games to keep UNLV in the mix.\n            ",

    "body": "\nWeek 13 of the NFL season is an intriguing one, especially with games spread out thanks to four contests across Thursday and Friday. NFL underdogs are always worth keeping an eye on, and NFL betting expert Jeff Hochman has identified an underdog betting trend for Week 13 which involves games with low totals, or the over/under. Here, Hochman breaks down the criteria for this trend while sharing which games qualify this week. NFL underdogs with low totals (over/under 42 or less)Win Rate: 206-151-10 ATS (57.7%)Sample Size: Since 2018Criteria: Underdogs of 6.5 or more points with a total of 42 or lessEdge: Weeks 10 to 15Why does this work?My job involves researching the best NFL systems that have a proven track record of generating profits. I focus on systems with a win rate of at least 60%. There were no such systems this week but I do like the system that we used last week, so let's run it back.When the total is 42 points or lower, the betting market expects a defensive battle or limitations in offensive performance. However, sportsbooks often do not adjust point spreads to reflect this lower scoring expectation. A larger point spread in a game with a total of 42 points or less represents a significantly greater percentage of the expected final score compared to a 6.5-point spread in a game with a total of 50 points. The betting market prices in the favorite's superiority as if normal scoring will occur, but the low total constrains how many points the superior team can actually generate. This has always been one of the sharpest NFL betting systems for underdogs, especially as the season progresses.Week 13 qualifiersTennessee Titans +6.5 vs. Jacksonville Jaguars | Confidence: 5 out of 5  The most compelling indicator comes from the Titans' recent ATS cover streak of three consecutive games. While Tennessee has lost its last six games, the team has been competitive and cashing spreads consistently. In their previous three losses, the Titans have lost by a combined 16 points, with each game remaining within a single possession. Last week, the Titans fell to the Seattle Seahawks 30-24 despite being 20-point underdogs at one point, showcasing resilience and improved execution under interim head coach Mike McCoy.Jacksonville has been winning with smoke and mirrors, sporting a +17 point differential and -0.4 net yards per play. The Jaguars have won three of their last four games, but two of those victories went into overtime. The Titans have appeared more competent since Brian Callahan's firing, which has coincided with Cam Ward's improvement from getting more reps.This matchup exemplifies a classic betting trap. It features a winning team facing an inferior opponent, and the spread seems too easy. The Titans lost both meetings against the Jags last season by one possession with a much weaker QB under center. Tennessee has not won a home game and will be motivated to secure a victory for its dedicated fans. This will be the Jaguars' fourth road game in five weeks and their first outdoor road game in over two months. That's an advantage for Tennessee that isn't reflected in the betting line. My model has Jacksonville as a 5.5-point favorite. Grab the 6.5 and sprinkle some money line action.Las Vegas Raiders +10 at Los Angeles Chargers | Confidence: 3 out of 5The most significant advantage for Las Vegas right now is the Chargers' struggling offensive line. They've really been struck with injuries, losing both starting tackles for the season. Rashawn Slater and Joe Alt are out, which means the backups have to step up and fill those big shoes. That could definitely play into the Raiders' hands. Maxx Crosby and company will face inexperienced offensive linemen rather than elite protection. I also like the fact that the Raiders fired offensive coordinator Chip Kelly, adding uncertainty about the type of game plan they will implement in this game.The Week 2 meeting between these teams, won 20-9 by L.A., showed Crosby struggling with only one pressure and a 10% win rate against established competition. However, the current matchup eliminates that elite tackle challenge. Consistent pressure from Crosby and the defensive front could force Justin Herbert into quicker, potentially errant decisions -- a significant challenge even for elite quarterbacks over the course of a full game. Los Angeles has allowed an average of 3.4 sacks per game, which ranks them 27th in the league. They have also played the 24th easiest schedule so far this season.Despite playing at SoFi Stadium, Raiders fans have historically filled the opposing venue, creating a near-home-field advantage for Las Vegas. While the Chargers are coming off a bye, this line seems super inflated, so let's grab the double digits. My model gives the Chargers an 8-point advantage.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        No. 7 Ole Miss and Mississippi State are set to meet Friday afternoon for the 122nd installment of the Egg Bowl, one of the most underrated feuds in all of college football. Though the Rebels tout the ranking entering this rivalry showdown, there's a lot on the line for both teams. Ole Miss could secure an at-large bid in the College Football Playoff with a win. The Rebels are also hunting their third straight series win, which is something they have not accomplished since 2002-04. They do hold a 66-46-6 all-time advantage against Mississippi State. Mississippi State, meanwhile, could attain bowl eligibility by beating Ole Miss. The Bulldogs have not been to the postseason since 2022, when they downed Illinois in the ReliaQuest Bowl. They also have not finished above .500 in that same span. Mississippi State will have homefield advantage, but Ole Miss is actually 2-0 in the last two games played in Starkville. The Bulldogs have not beat the Rebels within the friendly confines of Davis Wade Stadium in six years. State fans also haven't seen a home victory this season since Sept. 20, when the Bulldogs downed Northern Illinois. \nOle Miss vs. Mississippi State: Need to knowAll eyes on Lane Kiffin: The Egg Bowl is appointment viewing, but a lot of the focus around this year's rivalry game is off the field. Kiffin is currently weighing his future with Ole Miss. The noise swirling around his pending decision -- Florida and LSU are each trying to convince him to fill their coaching vacancies -- got so loud that athletic director Keith Carter released a statement saying that Kiffin's final decision will come the Saturday after Ole Miss' game against Mississippi State. Kiffin's conundrum will surely be on everyone's minds as the game goes on. Ole Miss looking to make program history: Not only can Ole Miss lock down a College Football Playoff spot with a win against its in-state rival, but the Rebels can also make a little history. With a win, they would improve to 11-1. That would tie the program record for the most wins in a season -- set in 2023, when Kiffin's Rebels went 11-2 -- and it would also be the first time that Ole Miss has ever won 11 regular season games.  Mississippi State trying to snap skids: While Ole Miss is on the precipice of making history, Mississippi State is one win away from bowl eligibility. That's a little extra motivation for the Bulldogs, who have not won six-plus games since 2022. They're also 2-21 in conference play since the start of the 2023 season, which is the worst mark among FBS teams. Mississippi State has not won against an AP top-10 team since 2020. It's 0-10 since. The Bulldogs can reverse all of those trends and secure a postseason appearance by downing Ole Miss. \nWhere to watch Ole Miss vs. Mississippi State liveDate: Friday, Nov. 28 | Time: 12 p.m. ETLocation: Davis Wade Stadium -- Starkville, Mississippi TV: ABC | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)  Ole Miss vs. Mississippi State prediction, picks\nDistractions aside, this is a game that Ole Miss should win handily. The Egg Bowl is a weird game, so it can be hard to predict, but the Rebels have a distinct advantage in almost every major category. They should be able to move the ball at-will against a Mississippi State team that ranks 15th in the SEC in total defense (393.2 yards per game) and scoring defense (28.4 points per game).

    "body": "\n        The final week of the regular season arrives with just three unbeaten teams standing -- each with a wildly different identity. No. 1 Ohio State has dominated through depth, elite talent and consistent efficiency, blending a powerhouse roster with one of the most disciplined cultures in the nation. No. 2 Indiana enters the weekend building on history: after making its first-ever College Football Playoff last season under Curt Cignetti, the Hoosiers are back, proving last year's breakthrough was no fluke. What was once a Cinderella run has now become a sustained, legitimate program fueled by momentum and confidence. Meanwhile, No. 3 Texas A&M has surged to perfection under Mike Elko, combining high-end recruiting, player development and strong transfer portal hauls that have placed the Aggies among the elite teams of 2025.All three have reached 11‑0, but their paths to perfection differ, and those differences could determine who is truly prepared for the national title.Ohio State has largely steamrolled opponents through overwhelming talent and game control, trailing for just 26 minutes and 9 seconds all season -- the fewest in FBS by a wide margin. Indiana has survived close calls and signature wins, proving the Hoosiers can thrive even when outmatched on paper. Texas A&M blends raw talent with excellent coaching, creating a balanced, versatile team that has passed every test so far -- even a 30-3 halftime deficit two weeks ago.\n        \n            \n                Mike Elko arrived at Texas A&M amid a chaotic coaching search. Now, he has the Aggies on the verge of history\n                \n                    Shehan Jeyarajah                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWith all three standing undefeated, it's worth examining exactly how they got here. Records alone don't tell the full story; recruiting pedigree, roster construction and NFL-level talent reveal what makes these unbeaten squads tick.\nRésumé comparisonStrength of RecordStrength of ScheduleGame ControlWins vs. current CFP Rankings\n    \n                                        \n    35211\n    \n                                        \n    23831\n    \n                                        \n    12381The numbers above are from ESPN's Football Power Index prior to Week 14 games:Ohio State grades out as the cleanest résumé in the nation, ranking No. 1 in game control. Its schedule, however, sits outside the top 50, and its only win over a current CFP Top 25 team came against preseason No. 1 Texas -- a win that has since diminished in weight as the Longhorns slipped out of contention.Indiana and Texas A&M occupy similar positions here, each owning just one win over a CFP-ranked team. For Indiana, the strength lies in consistency -- the Hoosiers rank No. 2 in strength of record and have delivered reliable performances across different game styles from defensive grinders to late-game escapes. Their No. 38 strength of schedule isn't overwhelming, but when paired with top-three game control, it reflects a team that has handled its slate with authority.Texas A&M enters the final week with the No. 1 strength of record and the toughest schedule of the unbeaten teams at No. 23 -- though, in the SEC, that still ranks 13th. The Aggies' profile was built with back-to-back wins over nationally ranked SEC opponents at the time, though LSU and Missouri have since fallen out of the CFP Rankings. The nonconference win over Notre Dame remains a strong résumé pillar, as the Fighting Irish have surged back into national championship contention.Roster comparisonBlue-Chip Ratio5-stars4-stars5-year average composite recruiting rankTop 150 transfers\n    \n                                        \n    89%  (No. 2)11563.87\n    \n                                        \n    N/a0752.42\n    \n                                        \n    82%  (No. 4)55710.48Ohio State's roster is built to dominate; a steady flow of five-star recruits and top-tier transfers has created one of the deepest, most talent-rich teams in the nation. Quarterback Julian Sayin, a transfer two cycles ago, has maximized the elite receiving corps around him, giving the Buckeyes a dynamic offensive attack. Ohio State ranks No. 2 in Bud Elliott's Blue-Chip Ratio for 2025, a reflection of elite high school recruiting.Indiana is the antithesis -- zero five-star signees, just seven four-star recruits over the past five years, yet the Hoosiers have translated culture, development and coaching into sustained on-field success under Cignetti. Quarterback Fernando Mendoza leads the way, and a wave of James Madison transfers has filled immediate roster needs while elevating the program's ceiling. Indiana proves that strategic development and system fit can turn modest recruiting classes into playoff-caliber teams.Texas A&M sits closer to Ohio State in recruiting pedigree, ranking No. 4 in Blue-Chip Ratio with five five-star recruits. Eight top-150 transfers supplement the roster, which combines inherited talent with high-end recruits and selective portal additions. Mike Elko has crafted a deep, versatile roster capable of competing at the highest level in the SEC after the program rarely reached its full potential since joining the conference in 2012.NFL prospectsCBS Sports Top 100 NFL Draft prospects\n    \n                                        \n    6 -- S Caleb Downs (No. 5); WR Carnell Tate (No. 6); LB Arvell Reese (No. 10); TE Max Klare (No. 27); LB Sonny Styles (No. 30); DL Kayden McDonald (No. 34)\n    \n                                        \n    4 -- QB Fernando Mendoza (No. 2); WR Omar Cooper Jr. (No. 35); DB D'Angelo Ponds (No. 46); IOL Carter Smith (No. 95)\n    \n                                        \n    4 -- EDGE Cashius Howell (No. 25); WR KC Concepcion (No. 45); IOL Chase Bisontis (No. 91); IOL Trey Zuhn III (No. 97)The three unbeaten teams aren't just built to win at the college level -- they also feature talent that projects to the next level. Ohio State boasts the deepest slate of elite prospects with six players ranked in CBS Sports' Top 100. Safety Caleb Downs anchors a dominant defense, while wideout Carnell Tate and tight end Max Klare give Sayin multiple weapons. Linebackers Arvell Reese and Sonny Styles add speed and playmaking, creating a roster loaded with pro-caliber talent.Indiana leans more on star power than volume. Mendoza ranks second nationally and is a Heisman Trophy contender. Wide receiver Omar Cooper Jr. and offensive lineman Carter Smith anchor critical supporting positions, proving that development and fit can elevate mid-tier recruits into NFL-level contributors.Texas A&M combines game-breaking edge talent with a sturdy, technically sound foundation. Edge rusher Cashius Howell has 11.5 sacks -- third-most in FBS -- while wideout KC Concepcion opens up the field. Interior linemen Chase Bisontis and Trey Zuhn III control the trenches, enabling both run and pass. Elko's system has maximized elite recruits and selective transfers, producing a roster that is both undefeated and rich in NFL-ready talent.Paths to contentionTogether, these three unbeaten teams represent contrasting paths to success: Ohio State with depth and efficiency, Indiana with culture-driven development and Texas A&M with a blend of elite recruiting and strategic transfers. Each stands on the verge of an undefeated regular season, but their résumés and roster composition reflect different strengths and approaches -- offering unique blueprints for playoff contention.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Originally from Chicago, Ohio State wide receiver Carnell Tate transferred to IMG Academy in Florida for his final two seasons of high school football. 247Sports recognized him as a five-star recruit and the No. 22 overall prospect after registering 20.3 yards per reception as a senior. As a freshman at Ohio State, he logged 18 receptions; modest production, but more than Chris Olave, Marvin Harrison Jr., Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Emeka Egbuka managed in their respective freshman campaigns. The Buckeyes are the active title holder of WR U. In addition to the aforementioned names, the program has also produced Garrett Wilson and Terry McLaurin. In fact, Ohio State has had a wide receiver drafted in the first round each of the past four years. Tate has elevated his game from fringe first-round selection to potentially first off the board at his position. He quickly emerged as a reliable target for quarterback Julian Sayin as the Buckeyes' bid to repeat as national champions marches onward. In addition to his work on the football field, the Illinois native has been recognized by the school and conference for his efforts in the classroom. Here's more on his background -- including his strengths and weaknesses as an NFL prospect, pro comparison and more: Carnell Tate NFL draft profile \nCBS prospect ranking: No. 6 overall (No. 2 WR)Consensus big board ranking (via NFL Mock Draft Database): No. 12 overall (No. 2 WR)To check out all of CBSSports.com's most recent mock drafts, click here.  \tNFL comparison: Cowboys George Pickens\nThe Pickens comparison is almost more of a placeholder right now, because it is not perfect.

    "body": "\n        Tampa Bay Buccaneers coach Todd Bowles is not ruling out quarterback Baker Mayfield playing against the Arizona Cardinals in Week 13 after Mayfield injured his non-throwing shoulder on a first-half hit during Sunday night's 34-7 loss to the Los Angeles Rams. However, Bowles told reporters on Wednesday that backup Teddy Bridgewater would get the majority of starting reps in practice ahead of hosting the Cardinals.After Mayfield's initial injury in the first quarter of the Week 12 game, Mayfield re-aggravated his shoulder on a Hail Mary attempt in the second quarter. Mayfield did not play the rest of the game and spent the second half in a sling as Tampa Bay lost its third straight game. On Wednesday, Bowles said Mayfield's availability would come down to how Mayfield feels at the end of the week.Monday's MRI has revealed that Mayfield has sustained a low-grade strain, according to NFL Media. Bowles characterized Mayfield as \"sore\" during his Wednesday availability. The Buccaneers (6-5) started the season 6-2, but this rough patch in recent weeks squandered their lead in the NFC South. Now tied with the Carolina Panthers at the top of the division, the Buccaneers are the No. 4 seed in the NFC with six games to play. Tampa Bay is gunning for its sixth straight divisional crown, but Mayfield's availability is paramount to reaching the postseason.\nMayfield threw a touchdown pass and two interceptions in the first half of Sunday's loss in Los Angeles before exiting the game. He was among the league's leading MVP candidates through the first six games before the schedule stiffened.The Buccaneers host the Cardinals, New Orleans Saints and Atlanta Falcons over the next three weeks as they turn to Bridgewater if Mayfield is sidelined. Mayfield experienced pain in his non-throwing shoulder before in his career after tearing his labrum during the 2021 season.A shoulder sprain usually takes a few weeks to heal, but quarterbacks have returned in short order with rest as well.\n\"You never want to see guys injured, especially your leader,\" Bridgewater said. \"But Baker's a tough guy, man. He tried to come back out there and tough it out for the guys. That says a lot about him.\"Now in his third season with the Buccaneers, Mayfield made 45 consecutive starts and has not missed a game since 2022, when a high ankle sprain with the Panthers caused him to miss time. Mayfield has thrown for 2,406 yards and 18 touchdowns this season with a 60.8 QBR, the second-highest rating of his career.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        While every manager has their Week 13 Fantasy football picks that are must-starts, there are also Fantasy streamers you have to consider. Jacoby Brissett is coming off a 300-yard game and has been one of the most productive quarterbacks over the last six weeks. Meanwhile, the likes of Tyrone Tracy Jr., Kenneth Gainwell, Khalil Shakir, Michael Wilson and Hunter Henry all had 100-plus scrimmage yards last week. Your Week 13 Fantasy football strategy has to decipher if these were one-off performances or if any of the aforementioned are deserving to be in your Week 13 Fantasy football lineups.In the case of Brissett, the journeyman has clearly been more than a one-week wonder as he has at least 337 total yards or multiple touchdowns in six straight. On Sunday, he and Arizona will face Tampa, which allowed Josh Allen and Matthew Stafford to absolutely shred it over the last two games. Where do the Week 13 Fantasy football projections rank Brissett in comparison to QBs potentially returning from injury like Aaron Rodgers, C.J. Stroud and Jaxson Dart?

Metcalf, a three-time 1,000-yard receiver who is the WR17 entering Week 13, may not warrant a spot in Week 13 Fantasy football lineups even though he's being started in 70% of leagues. The wideout scored a rushing touchdown last week, as Pittsburgh had to manufacture touches for him as the passing game, alone, isn't helping much in that regard. Metcalf has had 55 or fewer receiving yards in each of the last six weeks, with just one receiving score. Now he has to face Buffalo's No. 1 passing defense on Sunday, as the Bills are giving up just 169.4 passing yards over their last five games. Metcalf isn't among the top 24 wideouts in the Week 13 Fantasy football rankings, putting him outside of the WR2 radar in most-sized leagues.Another curveball: The model is high on Texans running back Woody Marks, who is the RB29 in standard leagues and the RB30 in PPR scoring. The rookie has supplanted veteran Nick Chubb as Houston's top back, with six straight games with double-digit carries. Marks is averaging 62.8 scrimmage yards with two scores over his last half-dozen contests, despite facing stacked boxes in the last three of those with Davis Mills under center. The Texans will face the Colts on Sunday, who just allowed Kareem Hunt to have 130 scrimmage yards last week and have given up five touchdowns to running backs over the last three games. Marks is a top-20 Fantasy RB in Week 13, per the model, slotting ahead of Breece Hall and Kenneth Walker III.

    "body": "\n        George Pickens has turned himself into one of the most productive wide receivers in the NFL, and that is making him very difficult to rank for Dynasty Fantasy Football purposes. It's a good problem, and one made more complicated by how many young stars we have at this position right now, but heading into an offseason where he is a free agent, he could also be one of the most important players to be right on. Let's start with a brief overview of what Pickens has done this season. He is currently WR3 on a per-game basis, behind only Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Puka Nacua. He is the only receiver with 1,000 yards besides JSN. He is also third in touchdowns behind Davante Adams and Amon-Ra St. Brown. Amongst receivers with at least 50 targets this season, he ranks top 5 in both yards per route run and yards per target. And he doesn't turn 25 until March of next year. This breakout started when CeeDee Lamb went down, but it hasn't slowed down since Lamb returned. He has been the best Cowboys' wide receiver in Fantasy since Lamb came back from his injury. Still, it is an eight-game sample of elite performance versus some much longer track record for the guys who were previously ahead of him. I have already moved him up to WR15, but just how high should we go.This week, I had Adam Pfeifer from FTN Fantasy on Fantasy Football Today Dynasty. We talked about Pickens, future posthype breakouts, whether we're optimistic about Bucky Irving, and more. Check it out:\nOn the episode above, Pfeifer argues for Pickens as a top 10 Dynasty wide receiver. Checking some other sources, I see him at WR21 in the FantasyPros consensus rankings and the Dynasty League Football Dynasty ADP. He is up to WR12 on KTC. A big part of this discrepancy may come from the fact that Pickens is a free agent after this year. If he had a long-term deal with Dallas, I imagine he would be top 12 just about everywhere. If he leaves and prioritizes money over situation, he could fall outside the top 20 again. That is not an answer we have available to us at this time, and Pickens is a volatile Dynasty asset because of that.Obviously, if you have Pickens and you are contending, there is much of a question as to what you should do. Hold him and start him, hope he keeps this up, and you win a championship. As to whether he is a buy or a sell at his current cost, I really believe that has more to do with the person you are negotiating with. I buy this breakout to the extent that it reminds us he is an extremely talented wide receiver who is still improving. I do not believe he has proven a bulletproof profile that could survive any landing spot this offseason. The last thing I will say about it is that it may seem foolish to think the Cowboys would let a talent like this go. I would remind you of who we are talking about and how they handled the Micah Parsons saga. The more Pickens does, the more expensive he becomes, which may make a franchise tag the most likely outcome this summer. There is no telling how Pickens would respond to that, but it is sure to be entertaining. It may also ensure we are having this conversation again next year.\nAs always, you can get my weekly updated Dynasty Trade Charts over on SportsLine.

    "body": "\n        The St. Louis Cardinals squared away one piece of business ahead of Thanksgiving on Tuesday, sending veteran right-hander Sonny Gray to the Boston Red Sox as part of a multi-player swap. (You can read our full trade analysis here.) Shipping Gray elsewhere may be the first major move of new top executive Chaim Bloom's tenure, but it won't be the last of this offseason. Rather, Bloom is in the early stages of what's likely to be a winter-long retooling of the Cardinals' big-league roster.Just who else might be on the move before Opening Day 2026? Below, CBS Sports has highlighted five particular players of interest, all the while providing analysis and potential landing spots. As always, keep in mind that a player's inclusion here does not guarantee they will be traded. Now, onward.1. Brendan Donovan, 2B/LF\nContract status: Under team control through the 2027 seasonPotential suitors: Yankees, Guardians, Astros, and most other contendersDonovan might be the most obvious trade candidate in the majors. His two years of remaining team control will stretch beyond his 31st birthday, and it seems unlikely that the Cardinals value those to the same extent that a more competitive squad will. Donovan has been a steady source of average and on-base percentage, regularly running his OPS+ between 110 and 120. He's also a versatile defender, capable of ping-ponging between the infield and outfield as needed. Donovan's protean nature makes him a fit for most any club, and that dynamic ought to ensure a strong return.2. Nolan Arenado, 3B\nContract status: Two years, $42 million remaining Potential suitors: Phillies, Tigers, Red SoxArenado has been a walking trade rumor for more than a year now. He remains a skilled defensive third baseman, but his bat has slipped and there's little reason to believe he'll provide league-average or better offense heading forward. The Cardinals showed in the Gray trade that they're willing to fork over generous sums in order to facilitate a move. Paying down Arenado's contract seems like a must if they want to send him packing before the springtime. \n3. Willson Contreras, 1B\nContract status: Two years, $36.5 million remaining (plus either a $17.5 million option or a $5 million buyout for the 2028 season)Potential suitors: Reds, Yankees, PadresContreras' first full year without catching went well at the plate, as he posted an OPS+ above 120 for a fourth consecutive season. While the short-term nature of his remaining contract is a plus, the drawback here is that he's still a right-handed-hitting first baseman entering his mid-30s. Modern front offices tend to be chilly toward that particular profile. Contreras' chances of moving, then, might hinge on how much money the Cardinals are willing to send with him -- or, alternatively, how teams react to losing out on the Pete Alonso sweepstakes.4. Nolan Gorman, 2B/3B\nContract status: Under team control through the 2028 seasonPotential suitors: Pirates, Royals, RaysThe Cardinals will, at a point sooner than later, have to make some tough calls on disappointing homegrown hitters. Gorman gets the nod here over someone like Jordan Walker because he's further along in service time. Indeed, he's already logged the requisite three years to qualify for arbitration. Gorman is coming off consecutive tough years, something that can be attributed in part to his extreme swing-and-miss tendencies and lack of a true position. While the Cardinals surely don't want to sell low here, the reality is that Gorman is a candidate to be non-tendered next winter. Oftentimes, it's better to bail a year early rather than a year late. \n5. JoJo Romero, LHP\nContract status: Under team control through the 2026 seasonPotential suitors: Yankees, Dodgers, TigersIn a not-so-distant St. Louis past, Romero would've pitched five times a week for Tony La Russa as a left-handed specialist. Over the last three years, he's leveraged his west-to-east arsenal (sinker, slider, change) to compile a 2.93 ERA (143 ERA+) and a 2.69 strikeout-to-walk ratio, all the while sporting a sizable platoon split (.463 OPS against lefties, .762 against righties). Romero is more of a barrel evader than a bat dodger, ranking in the 91st percentile or better in both average exit velocity and ground-ball percentage. He'll be a nifty fit for a team in front of a skilled infield defense. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Week 13 NFL schedule is arguably the most anticipated to date and not just because of the three Thanksgiving Day games and the Black Friday contest. The other standalone games to make Week 13 NFL picks on are both Super Bowl rematches. Broncos vs. Commanders saw Washington prevail in The Big Game back in 1988, and the Week 13 NFL odds have Denver as 6.5-point road favorites on Sunday night. Then on Monday, Giants vs. Patriots (-7.5) is a matchup we've seen twice in the Super Bowl, with New York winning each time.Sunday afternoon's slate features a couple of matchups where time and travel could be factors with your Week 13 NFL picks. Cardinals vs. Buccaneers (-3) and Rams vs. Panthers (+10.5) both see the NFC West teams flying to the East Coast for 1 p.m. ET kickoffs. Historically, this is known to favor the home teams, thus making the Bucs and Panthers, perhaps, a bit more appealing than the NFL spreads suggest. All of the updated Week 13 NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Week 13 NFL picks now. LIMITED TIME: Use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1 JOIN NOW. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your initial $5 bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now, it has turned its attention to the latest Week 13 NFL odds and NFL betting lines and locked in betting picks for every NFL matchup.

Kirk Cousins had two passing touchdowns in Sunday's win over New Orleans, and having two passing scores, plus getting a win, is something that Michael Penix Jr. did once across his 12 NFL starts. Meanwhile, the Jets also had a QB change, but Tyrod Taylor dropped to 0-2 this season in a Week 12 loss to Baltimore. Taylor has nearly as many turnovers (three) across his pair of starts as Justin Fields had (four) across nine starts, so it's hard to call the change an upgrade. The Falcons are undefeated ATS over their last three outside of Atlanta, while the Jets are just 1-3 ATS over their last four at MetLife Stadium. The model has Atlanta prevailing versus the spread well over 50% of the time. See which other teams to pick here.\nAnother one of its Week 13 NFL predictions: the Jaguars (-6.5, 41.5) cover versus the Titans in well over 50% of simulations. The Jags have won five of their last six versus the Titans, as Tennessee is now 1-16 over its last 17 games overall. Cam Ward hasn't thrown more than one touchdown in any game as a pro, and only J.J. McCarthy has a lower passer rating this season. Ward won't find much help in the ground game on Sunday as Jacksonville has the No. 1 run defense, while the Jags also control the trenches on offense as they rank eighth in rushing yards. The Jaguars are projected to have over 120 rushing yards, while the Titans have under 80 and average less than 3.8 yards per carry. The model has the Jags covering and says the Over hits in almost 60% of sims. See which other teams to pick here.\nHow to make Week 13 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 13 NFL schedule and just revealed four teams projected to outright win in at least 70% of simulations, potentially giving you a huge payday by betting the money line. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine.So what Week 13 NFL picks can you make with confidence, and which four teams should you lock in now?

    "body": "\nThe top two teams in the current Champions League group stage fight for supremacy on Wednesday, Nov. 26 when Arsenal host Bayern Munich. The Gunners are coming off a 4-1 win in the North London derby over Tottenham while Bayern logged a 6-2 victory over SC Freiburg. Arsenal are six points clear of Chelsea at the top of the Premier League and Bayern also have a six-point lead in the Bundesliga but this is the competition these clubs really want to win. They are both 4-0 in Champions League games this season and have the same goal differential but Bayern is ahead thanks to 14 goals scored compared to Arsenal's 11.Kickoff from Emirates Stadium is set for 3 p.m. ET on Wednesday.

With that being said, I'm looking at goals in this fixture. Bayern Munich currently have the best attack in all of Europe. They've played 18 matches across all competitions and have had over 2.5 goals in all 18. They've played four matches in UCL this season while out-scoring their opponents 14-3.Meanwhile, Arsenal are the standard for defense and in their four matches have outscored their opponents 11-0. They are yet to concede a goal in UCL play, but I believe that changes. Vincent Kompany doesn't know how to slow down or pivot. This team led by Harry Kane and Michael Olise will press for goals, and even while missing Luis Diaz, they'll be pressing. Meanwhile, Bayern's defense is susceptible to set pieces and Arsenal are the best set piece team on the planet.Big names missing and Michael OliseYou can't talk about this fixture without talking about the absentees. There are big names missing all over the pitch. Arsenal is expected to be missing Viktor Gyokeres, Kai Havertz, Martin Odegaard and their best defender Gabriel Magalhaes. Meanwhile, Bayern are still missing Jamal Musiala and Alphonso Davies and most noticeably, they'll be without Diaz, who was sent off with a red card against PSG on the last UCL matchday. With the dismissal of Diaz, a lot more pressure is going to fall on Harry Kane, Lennart Karl, and Michael Olise.I do think there will be goals for Bayern, especially with Arsenal missing Gabriel, and Olise will be the one I'm looking at to exploit these weaknesses. He has 12 goal contributions in his nine Bundesliga matches, and has three goal contributions already in UCL this season. While Harry Kane is double teamed, look towards Olise to make an impact.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        In 2010, Sidney Crosby propelled the Canada men's hockey team to a gold medal after scoring the game-winning goal in overtime against Team USA. On Sunday, though, Crosby looked on from the sideline as Jack Hughes' overtime goal lifted the Americans to a 2-1 win over Canada as Team USA won the gold for the first time since 1980. Crosby missed Canada's final two games of the Olympics after he sustained a lower-body injury during the quarterfinals. He said that the decision to sit out Canada's eventual loss to Team USA was his and his alone. \"I was pretty close,\" he said. \"I mean, ultimately I wasn't able to go out there and do what I needed to do in order to help the team, so at that point, you've got to make a decision that's best for the group. Not an easy one. But, you know, that's hockey.\"Crosby, a three-time Stanley Cup champion with the Pittsburgh Penguins who also helped the Canadians win the gold medal in 2014, said that this Canada team deserved a better outcome than what ultimately unfolded on Sunday. \"I think everyone should be proud the way the team performed,\" he said. \"I thought that, obviously, we did everything but score. In every facet, we were just so good today. I thought we deserved better, and unfortunately, you know, didn't come away at the win.\" Canada's Nathan McKinnon was a little more blunt during his postgame presser. \n\"You be the judge of who was the better team today,\" said McKinnon, who missed a golden chance to give Canada a 2-1 lead in the third period.Crosby's absence was certainly felt, especially on the offensive end. Canada got just one of its 42 shots past Connor Hellebuyck and were unable to take advantage of an extended 5-on-3 power play in the second period. The Canadians lost despite out-shooting the Americans, 42-26.\n        \n            \n                Team USA honors Johnny Gaudreau after defeating Canada to win the gold medal\n                \n                    Bryan DeArdo                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTeam USA got on the board first on Matt Boldy's first-period goal. Cale Makar tied things up in the second, and the game went into overtime after neither team was able to score during the third period. The Americas captured gold during the 3-on-3 overtime when Zach Werenski fed Jack Hughes for the game-winning goal.Crosby said that he was \"really proud\" of his team despite Sunday's outcome. \n\"I thought that the way we played all tournament, even the games leading up, I thought we were really good,\" he said. \"We were tested in some of those games. It's not easy to get to this point, and we just found ways. I thought one of our best games was probably today. And unfortunately, it doesn't work out for us. But I'm just really proud of the group and the way we competed and the way we played.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Shortly after winning America's first gold medal in men's hockey in 46 years, members of Team USA honored Johnny Gaudreau, a former Team USA member who tragically died in August of 2024. Zach Werenski, who played alongside Gaudreau during his final NHL seasons with the Columbus Blue Jackets, held up Gaudreau's Team USA jersey along with team captain Auston Matthews and assistant captain Matthew Tkachuk shortly after he fed Jack Hughes for the game-winning goal against Canada. The gesture occurred with members of Gaudreau's family looking on in the stands. \nAfter receiving their gold medals, Werenski and Dylan Larkin, who played with Gaudreau at multiple world championships, brought Gaudreau's young children out to the ice for a team photo. \n\"It means everything -- we all know he should be here with us,\" Larkin said of Gaudreau prior to the gold medal game. \"He should be with us. We love him, and I like that we continue to think about him and I wouldn't imagine it any other way.\"\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Johnny and his younger brother Matthew Gaudreau were killed after being stuck being an alleged drunk driver while cycling in New Jersey. Like his older brother, Matthew Gaudreau was also an accomplished hockey who played professionally in the AHL and ECHL before becoming a coach. A seven-time NHL All-Star, Johnny Gaudreau was a six-time All-Star for the Calgary Flames. He was the 2017 recipient of the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy, which is given annually to an NHL player \"adjudged to have exhibited the best type of sportsmanship and gentlemanly conduct combined with a high standard of playing ability.\"\nIn 2022, Gaudreau shocked most of the hockey world by deciding to sign with the Blue Jackets as a free agent. He was named to his seventh and ultimately final All-Star team during his first season in Columbus, who has continued to honor his legacy following his untimely death. Gaudreau helped Team USA win the gold medal at the 2013 IIHF Junior World Championships. He most recently played on Team USA during the 2024 IIHF World Championship. He never got a chance to play in the Olympics, though, as the NHL did not participate in the previous two Olympics. \"He wanted to be on this team,\" his father, Guy Gaudreau, said during the third period of the America's win over Slovakia. \"And it would've been nice if he'd been here.\"\nMembers of the Gaudreau family made the trip to Italy after being invited by Team USA. \"Our two daughters, for 24 hours, they just kept at us: 'You have to go. The boys would want you to do this. This would mean so much to John,'\" said Gaudreau's mother, Jane. \"It just means so much to our family, and we're so excited to remember what our boys meant to hockey.\"Their presence was certainly felt by Team USA. \"It's great having them here, and it's super special,\" Werenski said prior to Sunday's game. \"We're happy that we made it to the gold medal game so they can watch that and be a part of it. It's on us to make them proud.\"\nGaudreau served as inspiration throughout the Olympics for Team USA. His uniform was on the locker room throughout the Olympics, and it was on the ice on Sunday when the Americans made history by winning the gold medal for only the third time. \"He was one of America's very best,\" said Team USA coach Mike Sullivan. \"He's just a good person on the ice and off the ice, and I think he's an inspiration to our players to this very day.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Arguably the biggest stop en route to the NFL Draft is the NFL Scouting Combine, which brings well over 300 of the most talented football players in America to Indianapolis. There, the prospects will go through drills that test everything from their athleticism to their ability to fulfill the duties of their specific position on the football field. Every year, players utilize the combine, where all 32 NFL teams are represented by scouts and front office personnel, to improve their stock after putting together film in their final collegiate season. The NFL sent invites to 319 players in February now that the 2025 season is in the rearview mirror. It should come as no surprise that some of college football's top brands, like Alabama and Ohio State, will be sending plenty of players to Indianapolis. But upstarts like nearby Indiana, which completed one of the best Cinderella stories in college football history with a national title last season, have plenty of talent headed to the combine. \n        \n            \n                Wilson's 2026 NFL mock draft 6.0: Senior Bowl standouts Caleb Banks, Lee Hunter change Round 1 conversation\n                \n                    Ryan Wilson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHere's a look at the college programs that produced the most invites to the 2026 NFL Scouting Combine: \n1. Texas A&M -- 13 Notable players: WR KC Concepcion; OL Ar'maj Reed-Adams; DL Cashius Howell; LB Taurean York; DB Will Lee III Texas A&M, fresh off of its College Football Playoff debut, will have plenty of representation at the combine. Many eyes will be on the dynamic Concepcion, who has a chance to put up some eye-popping numbers. But the Aggies will have plenty of trench monsters going through drills as well. Four of their five offensive line starters and three of their top defensive linemen from the 2025 season are headed to Indianapolis. 2. Alabama -- 12 Notable players: QB Ty Simpson; WR Germie Bernard; OL Kadyn Proctor; DL LT Overton; LB Deontae Lawson \nThe combine should be a great opportunity for Simpson to boost his draft stock even further in a relatively weak quarterback class. He's already viewed as a first-round pick and his accuracy should show through in the routes-on-air period. Bernard is another potential riser to keep an eye on. He flew under the radar for most of the season, though he was Simpson's favorite target in the passing attack. Bernard's best work may come with the pads on, as he's a tough-running magician after the catch, but solid testing numbers could push him into an upper echelon. T-3. Ohio State -- 11 Notable players: WR Carnell Tate; TE Max Klare; DL Caden Curry; DL Kayden McDonald; LB Arvell Reese; DB Caleb Downs It should come as no surprise, given how dominant Ohio State was in 2025, that its defense leads the way among combine invites. Seven of the 11 prospects that will represent the Buckeyes in Indianapolis played on the defensive side of the ball. That includes several likely first-round prospects. Reese has a chance to be the first defender taken off the board. He can play off the ball or at edge rusher at the next level. McDonald was a unanimous All-American and the Big Ten Defensive Lineman of the Year. Downs has been one of the top defensive backs in college football since he stepped foot on campus, and he's only solidified that status over the last couple of seasons with the Buckeyes. He'll be a rare early safety picked in the 2026 NFL Draft. \nT-3. LSU -- 11 Notable players: QB Garrett Nussmeier; WR Barion Brown; LB Harold Perkins Jr.; DB Mansoor Delane; DB. A.J. Haulcy LSU may have had a disappointing season, but it certainly wasn't due to a lack of talent. Nussmeier did underperform while battling through various injury issues. Maybe he can use the combine to remind scouts why he was once thought of as a top prospect. Brown will certainly turn some heads. He's a top candidate to post the fastest 40-yard dash time of the entire event. T-5. Georgia -- 10 Notable players: WR Zachariah Branch; WR Colbie Young; DL Christen Miller; LB CJ Allen \nSpeaking of impressive 40-yard dash times, Branch will be a must-watch for those that enjoy speed. He's a fun gadget player that could find a nice home at the next level as a return specialist. Young is a physically impressive wideout. If his 6-foot-3 and 215-pound frame is verified by combine measurements, that will certainly stand out. T-5. Oklahoma -- 10Notable players: TE Jaren Kanak; DL Gracen Halton; DL R Mason Thomas; LB Owen Heinecke; DB Robert Spears-JenningsKanak is a fascinating prospect. He spent the first three years of his career as a linebacker before transitioning to tight end ahead of the 2025 season. He was a third-team All-SEC selection after finishing third among Sooners with 44 catches for 533 yards. It will be fascinating to see how he tests and where he lands in the draft. Oklahoma has seven defenders headed to the combine after its defense led the way to a College Football Playoff appearance last season. Four defensive linemen will rep the Sooners, who were gritty in the trenches in 2025. \nT-5. Miami -- 10 Notable players: QB Carson Beck; OL Francis Mauigoa; DL Rueben Bain Jr.; DL Akheem Mesidor; DB Keionte Scott Miami has a lot of extremely talented big fellas headed to the next level. Stalwarts like Mauigoa, a dominant offensive tackle, and Bain were a big reason why the Hurricanes made it all the way to the College Football Playoff National Championship. The edge-rushing duo of Bain and Mesidor played some of their best football in the postseason. They combined for a whopping 10.5 sacks during Miami's four-game run through the playoff. T-8. Clemson -- 9Notable players: QB Cade Klubnik; RB Adam Randall; WR Antonio Williams; DL T.J. Parker; DL Peter Woods \nKlubnik had a very disappointing 2025 campaign, but perhaps he can revive his image at the combine. As it has been so often with Clemson, though, defense is the focus here. Parker and Woods are two of the best defensive prospects in the draft. Both should hear their names called very early. T-8. Florida -- 9 Notable players: OL Jake Slaughter; DL Caleb Banks No matter how much Florida struggles on the field, it will always be well-represented in the draft. The Gators are good at churning out talent thanks to their ideal recruiting situation. Slaughter is arguably the top center prospect in the draft and Banks is a highly regarded defensive lineman that should have a solid professional career. T-8. Indiana -- 9 Notable players: QB Fernando Mendoza; WR Elijah Sarratt; OL Pat Coogan; LB Aiden Fisher; DB D'Angelo Ponds \nThe reigning national champions, obviously, have plenty of stars worth mentioning. Mendoza won the Heisman Trophy and, in all likelihood, he'll follow that up by going first overall in the 2026 NFL Draft. Ponds has a great shot to hear his name called in the first round as well, though his size may hold him back. Fisher has all the makings of a mid-round steal. He's a fundamentally sound linebacker that's always around the ball. It will be interesting to see how his athletic profile stacks up, but the tape doesn't lie. T-8. Iowa -- 9 Notable players: WR Kaden Wetjen; OL Gennings Dunker; OL Logan Jones; DB Xavier Nwankpa Don't sleep on the Hawkeyes. Wetjen is a fun player to watch. He's got a chance to carve out a solid career as a return specialist. Dunker and Jones are two of three starting offensive linemen from Iowa's 2025 squad that are expected to be drafted. \nT-8. Penn State -- 9 Notable players: QB Drew Allar; RB Kaytron Allen; RB Nicholas Singleton; OL Olaivavega Ioane; DL Dani Dennis-Sutton Allar probably won't compete at the combine as he continues to recover from an ankle injury that cut his 2025 season short. An NFL team will likely still take a late-round flier on him given his frame and natural talent. Allen and Singleton are both intriguing talents in their own right. Allen was the better of the two last season, but both had great moments in their collegiate careers and both should hear their names called in April. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Michigan State and Ohio State will meet for the first time on the hardwood this season Sunday on CBS in a pivotal Big Ten showdown with NCAA Tournament seeding and conference championship implications on the line. The two teams enter the day having won earlier in the week -- Michigan State over UCLA and Ohio State over Wisconsin, respectively -- setting up what should be a terrific matchup from East Lansing.Michigan State has been tough to beat on its homecourt this season, but it has not been infallible. It is 13-2 in games played in the Breslin Center, with both losses coming to teams ranked inside the top five. That should inspire at least a little confidence in the Buckeyes, who are in desperate need of stringing together some momentum after alternating between wins and losses in their last nine outings.Where to watch Ohio State vs. Michigan State liveDate: Sunday, Feb. 22 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: Breslin Center -- East Lansing, MichiganTV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App, Paramount+ Premium  Ohio State vs. Michigan State: Need to knowBig Ten title hopes: Michigan State enters Sunday 3.5 games back of Michigan in the Big Ten standings and likely needs to run the regular-season table to be in contention for a conference title. Given the way the Wolverines have played, it seems farfetched, but the Spartans can't lose sight of the goal against a Buckeyes team that could be easy to overlook if not taken seriously. Consistently inconsistent: Ohio State has alternated between winning and losing in its last nine games dating back more than a month, proving to be consistent only in its inconsistency. A win Sunday would be its first two-game winning streak since mid-January. It is coming off an 86-69 home win over Wisconsin.\nFearsome Fears: Michigan State guard Jeremy Fears Jr. leads all of college basketball in assists per game (9.3) and also leads his team in minutes and points per game with 31.6 and 15.1, respectively. He's made a significant jump in production from last season and is coming off his fourth consecutive double-double in which he had 16 points and 10 assists in an 82-59 win over UCLA.Ohio State vs. Michigan State prediction, pickOdds below via FanDuel Sportsbook\nMichigan State's 13-2 at home this season and 7-5-1 against the spread as home favorites. I'm taking the Spartans to win and would probably lay the points with them as they prep for their penultimate home game of the season. The way Fears has played of late should inspire confidence, but more than that, this Michigan State team has leveled up defensively, too. If they can find a way to slow Bruce Thornton they can win -- and perhaps handily. Pick: Michigan State -9 \n\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            MSU -9\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Ohio St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Ohio St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Ohio St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Ohio St.\n                    \n    \n    SU\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    Who will win and cover in every college basketball game? Visit SportsLine to get picks from the model that simulates each game 10,000 times and is up more than $1,200 for $100 players on its top-rated spread picks the past six years. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        No. 3 Duke's 68-63 win over No. 1 Michigan sent the Blue Devils surging to the No. 1 overall spot in CBS Sports Bracketology entering the final week of February. The Wolverines dropped back to the No. 2 overall seed following a tight, neutral-site loss that would likely serve as a tie-breaking mechanism for two teams that are close in the metrics employed by the selection committee.Michigan is still No. 1 in the NET, at KenPom and in Wins Above Bubble (WAB), which is a vital resume metric used by the committee. But Duke's 13 Quad 1 wins stack up impressively next to Michigan's haul of nine. And in a case where there is so little separating two teams with identical records and comparable metrics, this committee would likely fall back on what it saw Saturday.Arizona is running as the No. 3 overall seed after an impressive road win at Houston. Just like Michigan and Duke, the Wildcats are also 25-2 overall and alone in first place in their conference. But it would likely take a loss from Michigan or Duke for the Wildcats to rise since Arizona sits at third in most team sheet metrics.UConn rounds out the No. 1 seed line coming out of Saturday's action after the Huskies picked up a Quad 1 road win at Villanova. The Huskies' 73-63 road win over a projected tournament team came amid losses for Houston and Iowa State, who are the other top challengers for the fourth No. 1 seed.\n  Bracketology top seeds       \t \t \t \t \tSeedEastMidwestWestSouthNo. 1                                                     \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            UConn\n                    \n    \n    No. 2                                                     \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Illinois\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Houston\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    Check out the full field of 68 at the CBS Sports Bracketology hub.Following committee's logicDuring Saturday's March Madness bracket preview show on CBS, selection committee chair Keith Gill cited Iowa State's head-to-head win over Houston as part of the reason why the Cyclones got the nod as the final No. 1 seed. While ISU's Saturday night loss at BYU has already altered the picture, it was an insightful comment.There are no hard principles about how the committee is supposed to interpret head-to-head results. A year ago, Auburn edged Duke and Florida for the No. 1 overall seed despite having more overall losses and head-to-head losses against both. Additionally, both Duke and Florida won their conference tournaments while Auburn did not.2025 Auburn maintained a wide enough lead in Wins Above Bubble (WAB) and in sheer volume of Quad 1 victories that the Tigers were able to overcome those head-to-head defeats and be the top team in the bracket.\nBut if head-to-head results are valued by this year's committee in a situation where teams are clustered together in the seeding pool, then Kansas should still be a No. 3 seed over Texas Tech today. Though KU suffered a historic home loss against Cincinnati on Saturday, the Jayhawks still rate better in results-based metrics. They also own a 64-61 win at Texas Tech that came when the Red Raiders still had star forward JT Toppin. As a result, Kansas has a narrow lead on Texas Tech, for now, in the race for the final No. 3 seed.Could Florida be nearing a breakthrough?After being named the top No. 3 seed in Saturday's bracket preview, Florida remains a force to be reckoned with in the pursuit of a No. 2 seed. The Gators (21-6, 12-2 SEC) won their seventh straight game on Saturday at Ole Miss and rate No. 5 at KenPom, which is a predictive analytics metric used by the selection committee to evaluate teams. Following a slow start to the 2025-26 season, Florida still lags back at No. 13 in WAB, which is a vital resume-based metric. But no one in the national-title race has improved as much over the course of the season as the Gators, who are chomping at Illinois' heels for the final No. 2 seed. The Illini (22-6, 13-4 Big Ten) have dropped three of their last five games -- all in overtime -- following Saturday's 95-94 loss at UCLA.\n            ",

That's because what the selection committee told us during a 30-minute program on CBS is that if the 2026 NCAA Tournament would've started Saturday, the top two seeds in the bracket would've been Michigan and Duke -- point being that at least in the committee's eyes, what we had inside Capital One Arena was a No. 1 vs. No. 2 showdown 22 days before Selection Sunday.It wasn't pretty -- but it was fun.Final score: Duke 68, Michigan 63.Neither team played particularly well, especially on the offensive end. But the Blue Devils did score five more points than the Wolverines -- thanks largely to Cameron Boozer. The 6-foot-9 freshman took 10 shots, made six of them and finished with 18 points, 10 rebounds, seven assists and two blocks in 34 minutes while reminding the sport he's the clear leader in the CBS Sports National Player of the Year race. He's also now the best player on the team that's No. 1 in Sunday morning's updated CBS Sports Top 25 And 1 daily college basketball rankings, because the Blue Devils have moved to the top spot after their massive victory.Michigan is No. 2. Arizona is No. 3. Iowa State is No. 4. Houston is No. 5.Yes, I know Iowa State lost at BYU on Saturday while Houston lost to Arizona. But if you've been following the Top 25 And 1 for a while, you likely know that this deep into any season, I mostly care more about bodies of work than anything else, and I still think Iowa State and Houston belong in the top five based on their bodies of work despite losses this weekend. Put another way, if the NCAA Tournament started today, I still think Iowa State and Houston would be seeded above everybody below them in the Top 25 And 1, which is why they're above everybody they're above in the Top 25 And 1.\nSpeaking of, 15 of the 16 teams in Saturday's bracket preview were also in Saturday morning's Top 25 And 1, as I noted with Emily Proud on CBS Sports HQ. The only difference was that on Saturday morning, I had St. John's in my top 16 but did not have Texas Tech, while the selection committee had Texas Tech in its top 16 but omitted St. John's.Top 25 And 1 rankings\n        Biggest Movers\n    \n                4\n            \n                BYU\n            \n                8\n            \n                Vanderbilt\n            RkTeams\n                    ChgRcrd\n                                1\n                            \n                                    Duke\n                                \n                            Cameron Boozer finished with 18 points and 10 rebounds in Saturday's 68-63 win over Michigan.

But Wisconsin counters with elite ball security, ranking 9th in offensive turnover percentage,\" SportsLine college basketball expert Jeff Hochman said. \"When forced into half-court defense, Iowa struggles-ranking 16th of 18 Big Ten teams in 2-point defense. The Hawkeyes' defensive numbers also plummet on the road, where they've allowed 74 or more points in five of seven Big Ten away games.\" Back Wisconsin at DraftKings here:\nCeltics vs. Lakers Over 228.5This game takes place in Los Angeles, and no NBA team has hit the Over at a higher rate at home than the Lakers, with an 18-8 mark. These teams just met a few weeks ago, and that contest went over, despite the Lakers missing the firepower of both LeBron James and Luka Doncic. Meanwhile, Boston has seen each of its last two games surpass the total, as the model forecasts a dozen players scoring more than 9 points. With that, the Over hits 61.8% of the time in an A-rated pick. Back the Over at DraftKings here:Suns (+3.5) vs. Trail BlazersPhoenix is 8-4 against the spread over its last 12 home matchups with Portland, while also outright winning in eight of those 12. This season, the Suns are unparalleled when it comes to spread success as they boast the best ATS record in the league at 35-22. Two of those ATS victories came against Portland earlier this year, and the Blazers are mired in a slump versus the line as of late. They are just 3-6 ATS over their last nine games and are coming off a 54-point defeat to Denver on Friday, which is the second-biggest loss of any NBA team this season. The model has Phoenix covering almost 60% of the time. Back the Suns at DraftKings here:\nWant more NBA and college basketball picks on Sunday?You've seen some of the model's Sunday best bets.

Sunday's win came exactly 46 years to the day of that victory (Feb. 22, 1980).\nThe U.S. now has three Olympic gold medals on the men's side, having first won the hardware in 1960. Sunday's victory was its first off home ice in the Olympics. The women also have three gold medals, previously claiming the honors in 1998 and 2018.Four of the United States' six Olympic gold medals in hockey have come by defeating Canada.\nTeam USA gold medals in Olympic hockeyOlympicsTeamOpponentScore1960 Squaw ValleyMenCzechoslovakia9-41980 Lake PlacidMenSoviet Union4-31998 NaganoWomenCanada3-12018 PyeongChangWomenCanada3-22026 Milan CortinaWomenCanada2-1 (OT)2026 Milan CortinaMenCanada2-1 (OT)The Americans concluded the 2026 Olympics with 12 gold medals, the most ever for the Americans at the Winter Games, and 33 medals overall.

    "body": "\n        Officials handed out a pair of ejections after Memphis Grizzlies guard Scotty Pippen Jr. and Miami Heat forward Myron Gardner engaged in an altercation during the Heat's 136-120 win on Saturday. Pippen and Gardner watched the final 1:55 from the locker rooms as a result of their scuffle, which spilled into the courtside seats on one corner of the floor.An unnecessary hit on one end of the floor led to the skirmish on the other. Pippen drained a 3-pointer from the top of the arc to cut the Grizzlies' deficit to 134-113 with two minutes to play, and well after he released the ball, Gardner stepped in from well out of the play and made contact with Pippen's backside, sending him to the floor. There was no foul call.Pippen ran down the floor and clearly sought out Gardner in the left corner. He extended both arms in a targeted shove of Gardner, and the two tangled up and pulled each other to the ground. Officials, players and coaches sprinted to the scene to attempt to break up the fight. No other players engaged in fighting.\n\"I thought it was kind of a cheap shot,\" Pippen said of the play that sparked the fight. \"He kind of hit me when I didn't see him, so I thought it was a soft move. I just thought he maybe needed a hug at the other end, and that's kind of what happened.\"Pippen and Gardner could face discipline from the NBA, although the former downplayed the kerfuffle and said he does not expect the league to step in with punishment beyond the ejections.\n\"I don't think any punches or anything was thrown,\" Pippen said. \"I think it was just a hug. I don't think it was too crazy. I got ejected. I think that should be left at that, but we'll see.\"Heat coach Erik Spoelstra came to Gardner's defense after his involvement in the brouhaha and said that he loves Myron \"regardless\" of what occurred between him and Pippen.\"Let's exhale,\" Spoelstra said postgame. \"We'll take a look at it. His greatest strength is his unbridled intensity and effort and energy. His heart is in a great place. He's wired like us, competitively. You add that type of intensity to this competitive will that will boil over at times. I don't want to take away from that competitiveness.\"\nPippen finished the contest with 18 points in 21 minutes off the bench for a Memphis team that is spiraling further toward the bottom of the Western Conference with five losses in its last six games and 11 in its last 14. Gardner played six minutes across two stints on the floor for the Southeast Division-leading Heat.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 PGA Tour season rolls into the iconic Riviera Country Club in Los Angeles for Tiger Woods' event, the Genesis Invitational. The second straight signature event of the season puts big money is on the line for the 72 players who make up the field in the tournament's return to Riviera following a one-year absence.Collin Morikawa took home $3.6 million in his triumphant return to the winner's circle at Pebble Beach last week, snapping a winless drought of nearly three years. There are few better places to pick up a win at this point on the PGA Tour schedule than a signature event, and whoever performs best at Riviera this week is in for an even bigger payday. With eight fewer players in the field this week, most every spot on the leaderboard will earn a bit more cash from the $20 million prize pool at the Genesis, with the winner taking home $4 million. Last year, it was Ludvig Åberg who took home that top prize -- at Torrey Pines after a venue change due to wildfires in Los Angeles -- and it will be interesting to see whether the recent run of signature-event parity continues. Nine straight signature events have been won by different players, a significant departure from 2024 when Scottie Scheffler won four of the eight events on the calendar. Scheffler was the heavy favorite coming into Riviera, as is the case every week on the PGA Tour, but he barely made the cut and faces a massive climb over the final 36 holes.Rory McIlroy enters Round 4 in second place yet six shots back of leader Jacob Bridgeman, who has torn apart Riviera all week. Follow 2026 Genesis Invitational leaderboard coverage throughout Round 4.\nAll will be vying for their share of the $20 million purse.

The two-week competition was capped by a thrilling gold medal game in Men's Hockey where Team USA outlasted Canada to win the event for the first time in 46 years. The 12th and final American gold medal brings the country's total medal count to 33, an astounding number given recent troubles for Team USA in the Winter Games.The United States finished second among the 92 countries that competed in the Milan Cortina Games with 33 total medals. Its 12 gold medals are the most the U.S. has ever collected in the Winter Olympics, and the Americans finished solo second in both categories for the first time in 76 years (1952 Oslo Olympics).In Figure Skating, 20-year-old Alysa Liu became the first American woman to take home a singles gold medal in 24 years after her nearly flawless Free Skate program propelled her to the top of the podium.The U.S. Women's Hockey team rallied from a 1-0 third-period deficit to beat Canada in overtime as well and earn their first gold medal in eight years. Hilary Knight broke the American women's record for career goals previously held by Natalie Darwitz and Katie King. In the process, she also broke the record for most career Olympic points in U.S. women's hockey history.\nThe Americans swept the gold medals in hockey for the first time in their Olympic history.On the slopes, Mikaela Shiffrin took home gold in the Women's Slalom, her fourth Olympic medal and third gold medal overall. Jordan Stolz claimed three Olympic medals (two gold, one silver) in Speed Skating, the most by an American since Eric Heiden won five gold medals at the 1980 Lake Placid Olympics.Norway defended its crown as the most-awarded country in the Winter Olympics, from both the 2022 Beijing Games and all-time. The Norwegians won 18 gold medals and 41 total medals in Milan, Italy.\nHere's a breakdown of the final medal count for every country at the 2026 Winter Olympics.COUNTRYGOLDSILVERBRONZETOTAL\n            \n        \n    \n        NOR\n    \n    \n        Norway\n    \n\n    18121141\n            \n        \n    \n        USA\n    \n    \n        United States\n    \n\n    1212933\n            \n        \n    \n        NED\n    \n    \n        Netherlands\n    \n\n    107320\n            \n        \n    \n        ITA\n    \n    \n        Italy\n    \n\n    1061430\n            \n        \n    \n        GER\n    \n    \n        Germany\n    \n\n    810826\n            \n        \n    \n        FRA\n    \n    \n        France\n    \n\n    89623\n            \n        \n    \n        SWE\n    \n    \n        Sweden\n    \n\n    86418\n            \n        \n    \n        SUI\n    \n    \n        Switzerland\n    \n\n    69823\n            \n        \n    \n        AUT\n    \n    \n        Austria\n    \n\n    58518\n            \n        \n    \n        JPN\n    \n    \n        Japan\n    \n\n    571224\n            \n        \n    \n        CAN\n    \n    \n        Canada\n    \n\n    561021\n            \n        \n    \n        CHN\n    \n    \n        China\n    \n\n    54615\n            \n        \n    \n        KOR\n    \n    \n        South Korea\n    \n\n    34310\n            \n        \n    \n        AUS\n    \n    \n        Australia\n    \n\n    3216\n            \n        \n    \n        GBR\n    \n    \n        Great Britain\n    \n\n    3115\n            \n        \n    \n        CZE\n    \n    \n        Czechia \n    \n\n    2215\n            \n        \n    \n        SLO\n    \n    \n        Slovenia\n    \n\n    2114\n            \n        \n    \n        ESP\n    \n    \n        Spain\n    \n\n    1023\n            \n        \n    \n        BRA\n    \n    \n        Brazil\n    \n\n    1001\n            \n        \n    \n        KAZ\n    \n    \n        Kazakhstan\n    \n\n    1001\n            \n        \n    \n        POL\n    \n    \n        Poland\n    \n\n    0314\n            \n        \n    \n        NZL\n    \n    \n        New Zealand\n    \n\n    0213\n            \n        \n    \n        FIN\n    \n    \n        Finland\n    \n\n    0156\n            \n        \n    \n        LAT\n    \n    \n        Latvia\n    \n\n    0112\n            \n        \n    \n        DEN\n    \n    \n        Denmark\n    \n\n    0101\n            \n        \n    \n        EST\n    \n    \n        Estonia\n    \n\n    0101\n            \n        \n    \n        GEO\n    \n    \n        Georgia\n    \n\n    0101\n            \n        \n    \n        BUL\n    \n    \n        Bulgaria\n    \n\n    0022\n            \n        \n    \n        BEL\n    \n    \n        Belgium\n    \n\n    0011\n            \n",

    "body": "\n        It's important to draw a distinction between resume metrics and predictive metrics when talking about a team like Miami (Ohio) and the NCAA Tournament bubble. Selection decisions are closely tied to your resume and what you've accomplished, which is a good thing for Miami. The cries are already coming: \"But Miami hasn't even played a Quad 1 game!\"Despite the fact that it has played zero Quad 1 games and is just 1-0 in Quad 2, there is a metric on official NCAA team sheets that acknowledges the brilliance of an unbeaten start for Miami, which improved to 27-0 with a 91-77 win over Bowling Green on Feb. 20.It's called Wins Against Bubble (WAB), and it calculates how the average bubble team would perform against your schedule. With a WAB score of 2.18 as of Feb. 22, the No. 22 RedHawks are recognized for having over two more victories than the average bubble team would against their slate.Up next for MiamiThe remaining schedule for Miami which is trying to become the first team since Indiana accomplished the feat in the 1975-76 season.\nFeb. 24at Eastern Michigan6:30 pm ESPN+Feb. 27at Western Michigan6 p.m. CBS Sports NetworkMarch 3vs. Toledo7 p.m. ESPN+March 6at Ohio7 p.m. CBS Sports NetworkMarch 12-14MAC Tournament (Cleveland)TBDIf Miami doesn't win the MAC Tournament and needs an at-large ticket to the Big Dance, WAB will be one of its best friends. The RedHawks were ranked No. 34 in WAB as of Feb. 22. That's within at-large territory. Where it gets tricky is that any loss against MAC opposition carries a significant WAB penalty.Here are all the Selection Sunday scenarios for Miami as it heads down this the stretch with its first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2007 in sight.NCAA Tournament selection scenarios for Miami The simple scenario (win MAC Tournament) Record: Between 30-4 and 34-0 Confidence level: It's a partyLikely WAB range: Doesn't matter\nBust out the balloons and hire a caterer for the watch party. Miami can go 4-0 to close the regular season, 0-4 or something in between. It doesn't matter, so long as the RedHawks are cutting down the nets inside Cleveland's Rocket Arena at the end of the MAC Tournament on March 14. Winning the MAC Tournament is the only 100% guaranteed path to the Big Dance, and it won't be easy. The MAC isn't one of the handful of conferences now offering automatic byes to the semifinals for its top two seeds. The RedHawks will have to win three games in three days against a field consisting exclusively of the league's top eight teams.Many of the players on this Miami team were part of a gutting 76-74 loss to Akron in last year's MAC Tournament title game in which the Zips rallied late to stun the RedHawks. That should only provide more motivation as Miami seeks its first conference tournament title since 2007.\nThe MAC Madness scenarioSelection Sunday record: 31-1, 32-1 or 33-1Confidence level: Feeling optimisticLikely WAB range: 37-43Miami could still feel reasonably hopeful about making the Big Dance if it entered the MAC Tournament 31-0 and then dropped a game. While on some level it could matter who the loss came against, the RedHawks would still enter Selection Sunday with a WAB ranking in the at-large realm, regardless of who was responsible for handing them their first defeat.A loss on a neutral floor in the MAC Tournament would likely come with a WAB cost of around 0.80. If Miami lost 0.80 in WAB today, it would drop the RedHawks  from No. 34 in the metric to the low 40s.\nThe team with the best WAB ranking left out of last year's field was West Virginia, which arrived at Selection Sunday at No. 43 in the WAB. The 2025 selection process was the first to utilize WAB, so there isn't a trove of past precedents to rely upon. But WVU's exclusion last year sets a benchmark for Miami to aim for: don't fall to No. 43.Finishing the regular season undefeated and then losing in the MAC Tournament would likely be good enough to keep the RedHawks around or just below that figure, which would be enough for them to enter Selection Sunday with some cautious optimism.Double-defeat scenarioSelection Sunday record: 30-2, 31-2 or 32-2Confidence level: Feeling nervousLikely WAB range: 43-52\nThe double-defeat scenario involves Miami losing one regular-season game, in addition to a MAC Tournament game. This would not be advisable, as it would likely lead to Miami's Selection Sunday WAB ranking landing in the mid-40s, at best. However, in this scenario, the opponent for the conference tournament loss could make a difference. If it's a high-end Quad 2 loss against Akron in the title game, then it would be less costly.The team with the worst WAB ranking selected to last year's field was Xavier, which was among the Last Four In at No. 49 in WAB. However, the Musketeers counterbalanced their lagging resume metrics with a predictive metrics profile hovering around 40th nationally. \nMiami University does not have good predictive metrics to fall back upon. So slipping out of the low-to-mid 40s in WAB would make things dicey. If Miami loses twice, a slip of that magnitude is likely, and it would make Selection Sunday uncomfortable.Three-loss scenarioSelection Sunday record: 29-3, 30-3, 31-3Confidence level: Better brace for disappointmentLikely WAB range: 50-60A 2-2 finish to the regular season, combined with a loss in the MAC Tournament, would decimate Miami's at-large chances. In this scenario, the best conceivable outcome would be that the RedHawks  lose in the MAC Tournament title game against Akron in a heartbreaking way that tugs on the heartstrings of committee members. But it would be a tough case to make. \nWith three losses on its ledger, Miami would almost certainly lag behind other bubble teams in resume metrics. Remember, it's not just about win-loss record. It's about the totality of your resume. WAB does a good job of quantifying that, and it wouldn't be on Miami's side if the RedHawks  lost three times.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Arsenal restored their five-point lead atop the Premier League table with a 4-1 win at Tottenham Hotspur in the North London Derby on Sunday, taking full advantage of their injury-riddled opponents in a must-win match.Though Spurs returned to play for the first time since hiring Igor Tudor to replace Thomas Frank, the match went as expected for two sides in full contrast. Arsenal dictated play and were rewarded with a 32nd-minute goal from Eberechi Eze, who scored from close range as a frantic Spurs defense failed to cope with the Gunners' attacking charge. The visitors' lead was gone in a matter of two minutes courtesy of Randal Kolo Muani, who won possession on the left side of the penalty area and then cut inside for a strike right in front of goal.The stat sheet at halftime was reflective of the realities that the visitors were in the midst of a title charge and the hosts are technically staving off relegation and entered the weekend with 13 fit senior team players, as well as Spurs' stylistic tendencies. With only two true attack-minded players on the pitch and boasting a roster that, even at full fitness, is not built to be an offensive might, they had just two shots and 0.29 expected goals at the halftime break. Arsenal, meanwhile, took full advantage of an understaffed Spurs defense that was missing the suspended Cristian Romero and the injured Kevin Danso and had 12 shots and one expected goal.Things finally tipped in the Gunners' favor in the second half, first with Viktor Gyokere's impressive strike from distance in the 47th minute and then Eze's second strike in the 61st minute, the England international capitalizing on a sloppy moment from Spurs' defense along the way. In between Arsenal's second-half goals, Spurs thought they had an equalizer through Kolo Muani but he was called for a push on Gabriel in the process of scoring.\nSpurs attempted a attacking surge towards the end of the match, substitute Richarlison managing two shots in the dying minutes of the match, but their efforts did not pay off and in one of the final moments of the match, Gyokeres completed a brace of his own to ensure the Gunners would take all three points home.Eze, who joined Arsenal this summer from Crystal Palace and nearly signed with Tottenham, scored a hat trick against Spurs earlier this season.\nThis is Arsenal's first Premier League win in three, their grip on first place slipping slightly over the process. They finish the weekend five points ahead of Manchester City, who kept pace with a 2-1 win over Newcastle United on Saturday and also have a game in hand.\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe Boston Celtics were red-hot as they entered the All-Star break, winning six of their last seven games. They picked up where they left off after the hiatus as they began a four-game road trip with a 121-110 triumph over the Golden State Warriors.Boston (36-19) attempts to continue its surge when it takes on the Los Angeles Lakers (34-21) at 6:30 p.m. ET on Sunday at Crypto.com Arena.The Celtics have gone 12-4 since suffering back-to-back losses against the San Antonio Spurs and Indiana Pacers in mid-January. They now look to complete a sweep of the two-game season series after having trounced the Lakers 126-105 at home on Dec. 5.Los Angeles also has been playing well of late, winning 10 of its last 15 contests. The Lakers edged the Los Angeles Clippers 125-122 on Friday in their return from the All-Star break.There are 10 other games on Sunday's NBA schedule, including a matchup between the Orlando Magic (29-26) and host Clippers (27-29) at 9 p.m. ET at the Intuit Dome. The Magic cruised past the Clippers 129-101 at home in November to end their four-game losing streak in the all-time series.Meanwhile, the Warriors (29-27) hope to get on track when they host the Denver Nuggets (36-21) at 3:30 p.m. ET at the Chase Center in San Francisco. Golden State has lost back-to-back contests and eight of 12 since enjoying a four-game winning streak in mid-January.More than 20 games are on Sunday's college basketball slate, one of which is a Big Ten Conference clash that has Iowa (19-7) facing No. 24 Wisconsin (18-8) at 4 p.m. ET at the Kohl Center in Madison. The Hawkeyes are seeking their second straight victory against a ranked opponent after getting past No. 9 Nebraska 57-52 last Tuesday.The Nuggets are 6.5-point favorites against the Warriors in the latest consensus NBA odds, while the Celtics are 1.5-point favorites against the Lakers. The Clippers are 2.5-point favorites over the Magic and Wisconsin is a 3.5-point favorite against Iowa.Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Sunday, Feb. 22. All times EasternNBA best bets, where to watchNuggets at WarriorsTime: 3:30 p.m. | Location: San Francisco | TV: ABC | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Warriors +6.5 (-113) | Expert: Gui Santos Over 11.5 points (-123, PropBetGuy)The Nuggets were edged by the Clippers 115-114 in their return from the All-Star break but rebounded the following night, demolishing the Portland Trail Blazers by 54 points. Denver set a franchise record for most points in a road game with 157 in that victory. The Warriors have suffered back-to-back losses, but the SportsLine Projection Model doesn't believe they'll get trounced like Portland did as they cover the spread in 62% of its simulations. Golden State's Gui Santos is averaging only six points per game this season but has recorded at least 13 in seven of his last eight outings, and SportsLine props expert PropBetGuy (98-71, +1537 on his last 169 NBA player prop picks) likes the trend to continue. The 23-year-old forward faces a Denver defense that forces the action to secondary scorers and allows spot-up shots as the third-highest frequency in the league.Celtics at LakersTime: 6:30 p.m. | Location: Los Angeles | TV: NBC | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Celtics -131 | Expert: Payton Pritchard Over 5.5 assists (-139, Larry Hartstein)The Celtics are 18-10 on the road this season and have won three straight away from home. The Lakers were without both LeBron James and Luka Doncic in their 21-point loss at Boston earlier this season, but the SportsLine Projection Model doesn't think their presence on Sunday will be enough as its simulations have the Celtics winning 70% of the time. Payton Pritchard, who is averaging 5.4 assists this campaign, registered six in the first meeting with the Lakers also had a half-dozen against the Warriors on Thursday. SportsLine expert Larry Hartstein thinks the 28-year-old guard will reach that total against a Lakers squad that is allowing the eighth-most assists (27.5) per contest this season.Magic at ClippersTime: 9 p.m. | Location: Inglewood, Cal. | TV: NBA TV | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine pick -- Model: Clippers -135The Clippers will be looking to avenge their 28-point loss in Orlando and post their fifth victory in six meetings with the Magic. They'll definitely be more rested for this matchup as they last played on Friday while Orlando is coming off a 113-110 double-overtime loss to the Suns in Phoenix on Saturday night. The SportsLine Projection Model has the Clippers winning in 72% of its simulations.CBB best bets, where to watchIowa at No. 24 WisconsinTime: 4 p.m. | Location: Madison, Wisc. | TV: FS1 | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Over 147.5 (-109) | Expert: Wisconsin -2.5 (-110, Bruce Marshall)The Hawkeyes are the top defensive team in the Big Ten and ninth in the nation as they are allowing an average of 64.4 points. However, they yielded 70 or more points in four consecutive games before holding Nebraska to 52 last time out. The Badgers are third on the conference in scoring at 83.1 points per contest despite their 69-point effort in last Tuesday's loss to Ohio State and are 15th defensively in the 18-team Big Ten with an average of 76.0 points allowed. With all of that taken into account, the SportsLine Projection Model sees this matchup being an offensive battle as its simulations have the Over hitting well over 76% of the time. Wisconsin posted double-digit victories in each of its last two home games, and SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall feels the Badgers will at least cover the spread against Iowa.\n            ",

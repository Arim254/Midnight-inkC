    "body": "\n        The NASCAR Cup Series begins its 2026 season on Sunday, Feb. 15 with the 68th running of the Daytona 500. It was announced Saturday that the start time for \"The Great American Race\" was pushed up an hour to 1:30 p.m. ET on FOX, Fox One, MRN Radio and SiriusXM NASCAR Radio. Forecast calls for scattered showers and thunderstorms at Daytona International Speedway this weekend, potentially causing delays or interruptions to the race schedule.The drivers will race 200 laps around a 2.5-mile track, all hoping to be the one to hoist the Harley J. Earl Trophy in Victory Lane. The Daytona 500 has opened the NASCAR season every February since 1982.The NASCAR website says it is \"considered the most prestigious and important race in NASCAR.\"William Byron won last year's Daytona 500, marking his second victory in as many years. He is one of two active drivers with multiple victories in the race, alongside Denny Hamlin who has taken three checkered flags in the event. With a win, Byron would become the first driver to ever win the Daytona 500 back-to-back-to-back.Richard Petty is the all-time Daytona 500 win leader with seven and Cale Yarborough has four. Hamlin has a chance to tie for second-best all time and he's high in the conversation for drivers who could take the win. Ryan Blaney, who is after his first Daytona 500 win, and Joey Logano, who hasn't won it since 2015, are also two drivers to watch on Sunday. Last year's champ, Byron, clearly can not be ruled out either.\nSinger Miranda Lambert will perform ahead of the action and actor Kurt Russell will lead the field to the green flag.This year's race marks the 25th anniversary of the death of NASCAR legend Dale Earnhardt Sr., who died in a crash on the last lap in 2001. He has one Daytona 500 win, but he still holds the all-time record for total victories at Daytona International Speedway with 34.Where to watch the Daytona 500Date: Sunday, Feb. 15 | Time: 1:30 p.m. ETLocation: Daytona International Speedway -- Daytona Beach, FloridaTV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free) | Radio: MRN Radio, SiriusXM NASCAR Radio\nDaytona 500 starting lineup1.

This is the seventh time that the annual showcase has been in the City of Angels, but the first time that the Clippers will be the sole hosts.All of the action is taking place at the new Intuit Dome, which opened last season. The Clippers' arena, which cost $2 billion, has drawn rave reviews from fans and players alike, and will become the center of the basketball world for three days. Damian Lillard and Keshad Johnson were the big winners on All-Star Saturday. The Trail Blazers legend won his third career 3-point contest despite not playing this season as he recovers from a torn Achilles. Johnson, meanwhile, put his name on the radar by dunking and dancing his way to the Dunk Contest trophy.Bet NBA All-Star Weekend at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:Sunday evening brings the All-Star Game, and the format has been tweaked once again. This time, it's Team USA vs. Team USA vs. Team World. The All-Star selections have been separated into three teams and will compete in a round-robin tournament. The league hopes that pitting Americans against international players will generate a more competitive environment, but we'll have to wait to see if that makes a difference. \nHere's how to watch Sunday's NBA All-Star Game, which is tipping off in the middle of the afternoon in L.A.How to watch 2026 NBA All-Star GameTime: 5 p.m. ET | Date: Sunday, Feb. 15Location: Intuit Dome -- Los AngelesTV channel: NBC | Live stream: PeacockAhead of this weekend's festivities, CBS Sports' panel of experts made their picks for All-Star Game and All-Star Game MVP.

You'll remember him getting ticked off at Anthony Edwards in the skills competition when Ant decided to shoot left handed for the lols. \nHerbert: The theme here is that I think the guys I picked will take this stuff seriously. For the All-Star \"Game,\" I just picked the team that I thought would try the hardest. (I was tempted to take Team World, but, historically, Nikola Jokić and Luka Dončić have not expended much energy on this stage.) I can see Cunningham and Jalen Duren setting a competitive tone, especially with J.B. Bickerstaff coaching them. Maloney: I'm going with Team World to win the All-Star Game and Victor Wembanyama to take home MVP. Even with Giannis Antetokounmpo and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander sidelined due to injury, Team World is the most talented bunch, and Wembanyama has made it abundantly clear that he's taking this more seriously than everyone else. Salerno: If you watched the movie \"Hustle,\" you know Kermit Wilts, AKA Anthony Edwards, loves competition. In this kind of format/showcase, guards tend to dominate. I'm going with Edwards, -- and, by extension, the USA Stars team -- to have a night to remember in Southern California. The new format hopefully will inject new life into the ASG. \n            ",

The SportsLine Projection Model is backing underdogs in college basketball, picking Butler (+2.5) to cover at home against Seton Hall in a 6 p.m. ET tipoff and Belmont to win outright on the road (-102) in a crucial Missouri Valley Conference matchup against Murray State that also tips at 6 p.m. ET.Meanwhile, SportsLine NBA expert Larry Hartstein is dialing in on Team World to win the new three-team, round-robin format for the 2026 NBA All-Star Game, which tips off at 5 p.m. ET in the Intuit Dome. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every college basketball game 10,000 times and it enters Week 15 on a sizzling 11-1 run on its top-rated over/under college basketball picks dating back to last season, and is on an 11-5 run on top-rated CBB side picks.

He took over for Kevin Willard four seasons ago and won 17 games in his first year, 25 games in his second year and then seven games in his third year. Now Seton Hall is 17-7 with a 7-7 record and is looking like a fringy NCAA Tournament bubble team. However, the Pirates are only 7-9 against the spread as favorites this season and Butler is 8-6 against the spread at home. The model predicts that the Bulldogs win outright and cover in 72% of simulations. Back Butler to cover at DraftKings here:Belmont money line vs. Murray State (-102)Casey Alexander has managed at least 20 wins in each of his seven seasons as the head coach at Belmont, but he's still chasing his first NCAA Tournament appearance with the Bruins. Belmont is 23-4 overall this season and can give itself a three-game lead in the Missouri Valley Conference with a win over second-place Murray State (19-8, 11-5) on Sunday night. The model predicts that Belmont wins outright in 58% of simulations. Back Belmont at DraftKings here:Team World to win 2026 NBA All-Star Game tournament (+155)\"The new NBA All-Star format, with three teams competing in a round-robin tournament, should create more fan interest and more on-court intensity. I'll back the World team (+160) to prevail over USA Stripes (+155) and USA Stars (+200),\" Hartstein said. \"Any team (with) Nikola Jokic, Luka Doncic (who says he will play a 'little bit' on Sunday) and Victor Wembanyama should be the favorite. While Shai-Gilgeous Alexander and Giannis Antetokounpo won't play due to injuries, the World team supplements its big three with big-time performers like Jamal Murray, Pascal Siakam, Karl-Anthony Towns, and Alperen Sengun. Back Team World at DraftKings here:\nWant more college basketball picks on Sunday?You've seen some of the model's Sunday best bets.

It's been a rousing success thus far. The Americans routed Italy, 6-0, in their quarterfinal matchup on Friday to advance to the medal round.The Americans only led 1-0 after the first period due in large part to the spectacular efforts of Italy goaltender Gabriella Durante. However, the U.S. eventually solved Durante and hung five goals in the second period to coast to a blowout victory in the knockout round.Defender Megan Keller got on the board first, but it was Kendall Coyne Schofield who got the ball rolling for Team USA. She had two goals in the first few minutes of the middle frame -- her first two goals of the tournament -- and those set the tone for the rest of the game. Caroline Harvey tacked on another assist, giving her eight points and the U.S. women's record for the most points in a single Olympics for a defender. Harvey's fellow Wisconsin defender, Laila Edwards, also shined with one goal and one assist.\nTeam USA has now outscored its opponents 26-1 in these Olympics, and it outshot the Italians 51-6 in this game. The Americans have faced little resistance so far, but perhaps that will change in the semifinal game on Monday against Sweden, who advanced by upsetting Czechia 2-0 on Friday.Below is everything you need to know about how to watch Team USA's semifinal clash with Sweden, as well as how they got here.U.S. women's hockey Olympic scheduleAll times EasternPreliminary roundThursday, Feb. 5: USA 5, Czechia 1 Saturday, Feb. 7: USA 5, Finland 0Monday, Feb. 9: USA 5, Switzerland 0Tuesday, Feb. 10: USA 5, Canada 0QuarterfinalFriday, Feb. 13: USA 6, Italy 0SemifinalUSA vs. Sweden | Monday, Feb. 16 | 10:40 a.m. | TBDBronze medal game\nTBD vs. TBD | Thursday, Feb. 19 | 8:40 a.m. | TBDGold medal gameTBD vs. TBD | Thursday, Feb. 19 | 1:10 p.m. | TBD\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

The league has tried to drum up some more interest from fans and players alike to create a more intriguing event. Last year, that plan fell flat with a mini tournament that featured three All-Star teams and one Rising Stars team. This year, the league is still holding the mini tournament but will move to a USA vs. World format. The league wants to highlight the growing international talent, so we'll see Nikola Jokić, Luka Dončić, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and more compete against LeBron James, Kevin Durant and other top American talent. The rosters have already been set, so let's dig into some more details about the new format.\nHow to watch 2026 NBA All-Star GameTime: 5 p.m. ET | Date: Sunday, Feb. 15Location: Intuit Dome -- Los AngelesTV channel: NBC | Live stream: PeacockNBA All-Star Game format, explainedThe 24 All-Stars will be divided into three teams of eight.

Bickerstaff will coach USA Stars, while San Antonio Spurs coach Mitch Johnson will lead USA Stripes. Toronto Raptors coach Darko Rajaković will coach Team World.There will be a round-robin tournament of four, 12-minute games. USA Stars and Team World will face off in Game 1. The winner of that game will play USA Stripes in Game 2. The losing team of Game 1 will then play USA Stripes in Game 3. Following the three games, the two teams with the best record will face off in Game 4 with the chance to be crowned champions of All-Star Weekend.If all three teams have a 1-1 record after the first three games, the point differential from the round-robin games will be used to determine the two teams that advance to the championship game.The All-Star Game has a $1.8 million prize pool.

Sac State will serve as a replacement for Northern Illinois in the MAC.

After that waiver was denied by the NCAA, the school competed for one final football season in the Big Sky, finishing 7-5 overall with a 5-3 conference mark.Meanwhile, school president Luke Wood and athletic director Mark Orr went back to the drawing board, with the MAC mebership emerging as the most logical path to the FBS. The Hornets have also been preparing on the NIL front, with a budget \"north of $1 million,\" a source told CBS Sports. \nThe school hired Arizona assistant Alonzo Carter on Dec. 15 after former coach Brennan Marion departed to join Deion Sanders' Colorado staff as offensive coordinator. Carter is a first-time head coach who has spent the last eight seasons working under Brent Brennan at both San Jose State and Arizona. He has deep recruiting ties to California after starting his career as a high school coach in the state.\"We are thrilled to welcome Alonzo Carter as our next head football coach,\" Orr said in a statement released by the school. \"Coach Carter is a proven leader who has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to developing student-athletes on and off the field. His history of success in recruiting, constructing teams, and producing results at all levels of football makes him an ideal fit for Sacramento State. We look forward to welcoming him and his family back to his native Northern California and having him as part of the Sacramento community for years to come.\"\nThe Hornets will be the second FCS school to make the jump in 2026, joining North Dakota State. The Bison moved up from the Missouri Valley Conference to the Mountain West earlier this month. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Six months into a season, it is not unusual to know what to expect from any given team on any given day and that was certainly the case for anyone who cared to check on Tottenham Hotspur on Tuesday as they faced Newcastle United. A sluggish team who seemed a step or two behind the opponent in terms of intensity levels? Check. A porous defense that seems to lack chemistry? Check. An attack that has very few ideas? Check. Few redeeming qualities as the team slouched to yet another Premier League defeat? Check again.Thomas Frank, whose months-long spell in charge of the team finally came to an end after their latest drab performance, did not create all of Spurs' issues. He is right to point to the fact that he, like his predecessor Ange Postecoglou last season, had to contend with an injury crisis of epic proportions, all while captain Cristian Romero serves a suspension for a red card in their 2-0 defeat at Manchester United on Saturday. He was not wrong to note that this very team finished 17th in the Premier League last season, an admission that the ceiling is only so high for the current iteration of Spurs. Frank, though, did not do himself a single favor during his brief stint in north London, emerging as a rare example of a coach who truly earned a promotion to the big leagues but failed to prove his worth for the most part.Frank's tenure with Spurs is remarkable for all the wrong reasons, the Denmark native unable to live up to the billing in any real sense. He was supposed to be a practical alternative to Postecoglou, who spent much more time ensuring his team had a functioning attack than a competent defense. It was not the only issue the next coach should have theoretically fixed – his Brentford side were organized when defending set pieces and impactful on the flip side, a signal that Frank's Spurs would be efficient on both ends of the pitch.His perceived pragmatism, though, was mistaken for ability. Frank inherited a mess but he also failed to improve the issues that were fully in his control. There were very few categories in which Frank made a noticeable positive impact, an underperformance that is easy to spot regardless of how one chooses to define success. Averaging 0.1 more point per match compared to Postecoglou's Spurs last season is not much of a flex, and neither is making an improvement of 0.3 goals against per game when the team ranks 13th in the Premier League when sorting for expected goals against. If Postecoglou was reckless for allowing a porous back line to take shape despite boasting brilliant defenders in Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven, Frank is guilty of the same crime despite having the upper hand of a fit first-choice center back duo for much of the season.\nTottenham (2025-26)Tottenham  (2024-25) Brentford (2024-25)Points per game1.11.01.5Goals per game1.41.71.7Expected goals per game1.11.61.6Goals against per game1.41.71.4Expected goals against per game1.51.71.5Spurs' defensive shortcomings were hard to ignore even in a superficial watch on any given matchday. The defenders at his disposal had years of experience alongside one another and yet appeared completely disjointed, the natural result of Frank failing to lock in tactical foundations and going back to the drawing board more often than a coach of his caliber usually does. His defenders seemed unsure of their next move, unable to rely upon their instincts and mistake-prone as a result. Frustration and despair oozed out of the players each time a goal was conceded, no matter how predictable it was; contempt grew amongst the fanbase, who were more prone to booing than cheering quickly enough in Frank's tenure.Frank's Spurs underperformed in equal measure in front of goal. The coach had the bare bones of an attacking idea from the start of the season, one that seemed to go hand-in-hand with Spurs' odd squad construction. He would bypass midfield for the most part and instead prioritize play on the wings to generate attacking opportunities, a solution of sorts for a team that lacked any real passers after James Maddison tore his ACL in preseason, all while nicking a few goals off of set pieces. That plan did not pan out all that much – Spurs' attacking statistics this season are buoyed by an early season blitz in which they outperformed their expected goals tally, a run of beginner's luck that is generally hard to sustain.In no time at all, Spurs were out of ideas. Completing simple attacking plays was a difficult task, while their game was never built around earning more set pieces even though it was the rare area of the game they actually excelled in. At times, Frank sucked the life out of games instead, hoping his disinterest in scoring goals would grind opponents' attacks into dust. The coach gave an overly conservative approach the runout a handful of times last fall in matches that could have served as statement-making performances and at this point, it should come as no surprise that it did not work. Spurs tallied three shots and 0.12 xG in a 1-0 loss to Chelsea in which the Blues were unlucky not to have scored more as they racked up 15 attempts and 3.68 xG. Days later, Arsenal made sure not to waste their chances – they cruised to a 4-1 win as they tallied 17 shots and 1.93 xG, all while Spurs had three shots and 0.07 xG to speak of. It was evidently worse than Postecoglou's figures, but even Frank's own in his final season at Brentford.The inability to defend and attack properly was visible even at the end of Frank's tenure, perfectly encapsulated in the final goal Spurs conceded before his firing. His side could not complete a simple breakaway minutes after notching an equalizer against Newcastle, instead letting Anthony Gordon dance around a still Spurs defense before Jacob Ramsey popped the ball into the back fo the net.\nFrank's Spurs were lifeless, a whiplash-inducing exercise for anyone who remembers watching Postecoglou's version of the team. It was strange to watch Frank's Spurs give attacking a try for 45 minutes at a time every third or fourth game and then settle into a defensive structure that they could not maintain, inviting opponents into the match rather than killing the game entirely. Almost singlehandedly, he demonstrated that the belief that pragmatism is inherently efficient is a trope rather than a tried and tested philosophy for success in this sport. There is nothing practical about taking the foot off the gas when things are trending in the right direction. It is not effective to keep taking a stab at a losing strategy, hoping it will finally turn good. It is painfully unrealistic not to find a way to lean on your strengths, even if they are few and far between. There is nothing sensible about failing to lay down tactical foundations, rendering your team unable to execute a stylistic vision that seems like a prerequisite to being an elite coach.With Frank at the helm, Spurs merely dragged their feet through matches as if they were simply there to collect an attendance award rather than play. No one wins trophies with style points but Frank proved one can certainly lose without them, his team always hitting the pitch with a sense of aimlessness. It is no wonder, then, that he drew the ire of the Spurs faithful, who, unlike his team in attack, wasted no chance to lambast him for spearheading a \"boring, boring Tottenham\" – in every sense, he sucked the entertainment value and the inherent joy out of the game. In a landscape where the sport's next great managers increasingly prefer tactical rigidity, Frank's Spurs will act as a prime example in the downside of straying too far down that path. Being cautious does not inherently come with rewards, nor does it necessarily come with stability and in this case, it can slowly contribute to the erosion of an already decaying product. It forces existential questions, too, of what exactly the point of this particular exercise was for a team in desperate need of a course correction.Spurs' squad may not be up to the task of finishing even remotely close to a UEFA Champions League spot, but neither is Frank. In an age where clubs are quick to dispose of managers, he was given a chance but threw it away completely, the glimmer of hope that came in the UEFA Super Cup outing against Paris Saint-Germain an outlier rather than the start of a promising trend. Frank's firing will require a serious rethink by Spurs' leaders, many of whom are brand new to their roles after longtime chairman Daniel Levy's exit in September, because their current woes are the result of years of mismanagement and remarkably poor squad building, their trip to the Champions League final seven years ago now a distant memory of a long-gone era.\n            ",

The Friars' Duncan Powell sparked the scuffle between Big East rivals when he committed a hard foul early in the second half   on St. John's forward Bryce Hopkins, who played at Providence from 2022-25 before transferring to the Red Storm. \nPowell, who was assessed a Flagrant-2 for the foul, and Hopkins immediately went after each other, which caused players from both benches to spill out onto the court. It took officials and security guards almost a minute to break up the ensuing scrum. Officials also paused play for 19 minutes so that they could review footage and issue appropriate punishment. St. John's coach Rick Pitino, who coached at Providence from 1985-87, also entered the play area in an attempt to remove his players from the situation. Powell was one of two Providence players ejected alongside leading scorer Jaylin Sellers, who immediately joined Powell in shoving St. John's players. Officials ejected St. John's forward Dillon Mitchell for his initial involvement in the scrap. Red Storm bench players Kelvin Odih, Ruben Prey and Lefteris Liotopoulos were all tossed for leaving the St. John's bench area. Hopkins shot two free throws for the initial foul and St. John's guard Oziyah Sellers shot free throws for the technical foul assessed on Providence's Sellers. Oziyah Sellers then scored to expand the St. John's lead to 44-40 with just over 14 minutes to play in the second half. \nPowell will also be suspended for Providence's next game against DePaul since he was ejected for fighting after the Flagrant-2.   The end of the fight caused further tempers to flare. Later in the second half, Providence forward Jameir Jones was immediately ejected after he pushed Hopkins while Hopkins was driving to the basket. Jones did not attempt to play the ball. Players from both sides jawed at each other following Jones' shove and subsequent ejection, but another scuffle was avoided. \nAfter the game Pitino avoided comment on the incident.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        No. 16 Texas Tech roared back to stun No. 1 Arizona 78-75 in overtime on Saturday in a Big 12 thriller with wide-ranging ramifications. The loss caps an 0-2 week for the Wildcats, who were the last unbeaten high-major team until Monday night's loss at Kansas.Arizona led 64-57 with just over three minutes left in regulation before going cold down the stretch while playing shorthanded. Star freshman forward Koa Peat did not play in the second half due to a lower body injury, effectively leaving Arizona with a six-man rotation.The Wildcats (23-2, 10-2 Big 12) were also without freshman forward Dwayne Aristode due to illness. Texas Tech (19-6, 9-3 Big 12) is not a deep team, either, but the Red Raiders have grown accustomed to playing long minutes this season, and they rose to the occasion late.JT Toppin led the way with 31 points and 13 rebounds in 44 minutes for the Red Raiders and scored eight in the overtime period. His offensive rebound with six seconds left also helped cement the outcome.\nChristian Anderson added 19 points and eight assists. He played all 45 minutes.\nThe outcome solidifies the chances that No. 2 Michigan jumps to No. 1 in the AP Top 25 poll on Monday. It also means No. 3 Houston (23-2, 11-1 Big 12) is now alone atop the Big 12 standings.Texas Tech has now defeated three of the No. 1 seeds in CBS Sports Bracketology, as the Red Raiders also own wins over Duke and Houston.Why Arizona will remain a No. 1 seedIt's just Arizona's second loss, and it's not a bad loss. Therefore, the Wildcats are expected to remain on the No. 1 seed line in the CBS Sports Bracketology model. \nHowever, this will create some separation between Michigan and Arizona for the time being. The model already favored Michigan as the No. 1 overall seed due to its No. 1 ranking in WAB (Wins Above Bubble) and No. 1 ranking at KenPom. But it was harder to draw a distinction between the teams when they both had just one loss. The call for No. 1 overall is certainly more obvious now.What about Texas Tech?Texas Tech is projected by the CBS Sports Bracketology model to stay a No. 4 seed but to move up within the No. 4 seed hierarchy. Over the long run, a metric-moving result like beating the nation's No. 1 team on the road will help tremendously in making a push back toward the No. 3 line practical for the Red Raiders, who reached the Elite Eight as a No. 3 seed last season. Beating the NET's No. 2 team on the road is worth a whopping 0.93 in WAB, which could result in a 3-4 spot jump for the Red Raiders, who entered the day at No. 15 in the important resume metric. Texas Tech's six losses are all of the Quad 1 variety, and it now has six Quad 1 wins to match them.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Michigan is No. 1 in Sunday morning's updated CBS Sports Top 25 And 1 daily college basketball rankings for the sixth consecutive day -- and, if you've been following along since early November, you likely know the Wolverines have also been No. 1 in the Top 25 And 1 for other parts of the season. But, for one reason or another, they've yet to move to No. 1 in the Associated Press Top 25 poll despite dominating the sport, their conference, and beating ranked competition in an unprecedented way.That should change Monday, though.Arizona's two losses over the past week, paired with Michigan winning at Northwestern 87-75 on Wednesday and then beating UCLA 86-56 on Saturday, should be enough to get Dusty May's team to the top spot. Truth be told, Michigan should be the unanimous No. 1.There's no sensible alternative option.The Wolverines are 24-1 overall, 14-1 in the Big Ten and on a 10-game winning streak featuring victories over Michigan State, Nebraska and Ohio State. They're 9-0 in Quadrant-1 and college basketball's only one-loss power-conference team. They own 40-point victories over Gonzaga and San Diego State, 30-point wins over Auburn and UCLA, and a 28-point win over Villanova. Beyond the Top 25 And 1, they're also No. 1 in the NET, at KenPom.com, BartTorvik.com, EvanMiya.com and basically every other dot-com I know.\nNo other team can match that resume.So, yeah, I think Michigan will get to No. 1 in the AP Poll on Monday. And then, just one day later, on Tuesday, we'll get No. 1 Michigan at Purdue in a matchup of Final Four contenders. If Purdue wins it, there's a scenario where the top six teams in the Big Ten could be within two games of each other in the loss column of the league standings on Wednesday morning. Fun race. It probably won't be decided until the final weekend of the regular season.As for movement in Sunday morning's Top 25 And 1, Arizona's 78-75 overtime loss to Texas Tech pushed the Wildcats down to No. 4 and elevated the Red Raiders up to No. 16. That development knocked St. John's down one spot to No. 17, no fault of its own. And Kansas getting blasted at Iowa State, 74-56, resulted in the Jayhawks dropping to No. 9, which allowed Purdue and Nebraska to move up to No. 7 and No. 8, respectively.\nThe team right behind that group, No. 10 Illinois, is the only ranked team in action Sunday. The Illini are hosting Indiana in a game scheduled to tip at 1 pm ET.

    "body": "\n        There are lots of ways to score points, but usually quarterback play, offensive line strength and dynamic playmakers are essential to building an explosive offense in college football. Indiana featured all three last year, riding the nation's No. 3 scoring offense all the way to a historic College Football Playoff National Championship. The weren't alone, though, with seven CFP teams ranking No. 32 or better in points per game in 2025. So while it's not a garuntee of success, fielding an offense that can score points at will provides a difiniitive advantage and a leg up in a landscape growing more competitive by the day. Coming out of the 2026 recruiting and transfer portal cycle, some teams appear better equipped than others to light up the scoreboard next season.Here's a projection of which college football teams could field the most explosive offenses in 2026:\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. TexasTexas added Auburn wide receiver Cam Coleman along with running backs Hollywood Smothers (NC State) and Raleek Brown (Arizona State) to help reshape the offense for 2026. The Longhorns won bidding battles for Coleman and Smothers, who combined for 12 touchdowns at their previous stops last season.Arch Manning is coming off the best outing of his career after outdueling Michigan's Bryce Underwood in the Citrus Bowl, a postseason showing that mirrored the second-half surge that accelerated his development. If Manning takes another step, this Texas offense could rival the best of the Sarkisian era on the Forty Acres -- a stretch that already includes consecutive CFP semifinal appearances.Like other elite programs that are a grenade-pin pull away from another level in 2026, everything starts up front for Texas. The Longhorns have reloaded with a bevy of highly rated portal additions who will flourish only if Manning has time to operate. If Texas controls the line of scrimmage, the pieces are in place for this SEC power to stress opposing defenses behind elite play-caller Steve Sarkisian and a rising star at quarterback.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. MiamiAssuming the Hurricanes overcome the loss of four impact starters along the offensive line, Miami should continue generating explosive plays and scoring at a rapid pace next fall. The arrival of Duke transfer quarterback Darian Mensah -- along with his top target Cooper Barkate and former South Carolina slot receiver Vandrevius Jacobs -- gives Shannon Dawson flexibility and eases the burden on Malachi Toney.Targeted heavily down the stretch of his freshman season, Toney set a single-season program record with 109 receptions.Veteran running backs Mark Fletcher Jr. and Jordan Lyle also return. Three of Fletcher's six 100-yard performances came over the final four games, when Lyle was limited by injury.\nProjecting ahead, Mario Cristobal's likely starting offensive line could include Matthew McCoy, Samson Okunlola, SJ Alofaituli, Jamal Meriweather and five-star freshman tackle Jackson Cantwell -- the No. 2 overall prospect in the 2026 class. If that group controls the line of scrimmage the way Miami did in 2025, the Hurricanes could be borderline unstoppable offensively.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. IndianaAfter leading the Big Ten in scoring offense each of the past two seasons, expectations may be bordering on unrealistic entering Curt Cignetti's third year. Fresh off a national championship, Indiana must replace a Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback, its top two running backs, leading receivers Elijah Sarratt and Omar Cooper Jr., and three offensive line starters.Few programs, however, are better positioned to absorb that level of change. Indiana's recent success has been driven by player development and precise scheme execution.\nCignetti has tabbed TCU transfer Josh Hoover as the replacement for Fernando Mendoza. Boston College transfer Turbo Richard adds explosiveness to the run game, while Michigan State's Nick Marsh and Tulane's Shazz Preston join Charlie Becker to reshape the receiving corps.The mentality up front is not expected to change. Whether the Hoosiers maintain their edge -- and the offensive efficiency that has defined this run -- will be determined quickly at the line of scrimmage.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Ohio StateRyan Day's decision to hire former NFL coach Arthur Smith as offensive coordinator has drawn mixed reviews, much of which is tied to Smith's results at the professional level. The college game presents a different equation, however, particularly when elite programs can overwhelm opponents with superior talent. That setting could allow Smith to thrive.\nAt Ohio State, Smith is expected to employ a streamlined, run-oriented approach while creating calculated downfield opportunities for Jeremiah Smith and others. Quarterback Julian Sayin ranked among the nation's most efficient passers as a redshirt freshman, and a significant leap is anticipated from the Heisman hopeful.Despite transfer portal losses at wide receiver, the Buckeyes remain loaded at the position, highlighted by the additions of five-star prospects Chris Henry Jr. and Jerquaden Guilford. Smith, Devin McCuin and Brandon Innis are projected starters, with Bo Jackson back at tailback.Solidifying the offensive line rotation looms as a key offseason priority. Day has emphasized the need to play at least eight linemen with positional versatility, underscoring the importance of depth and flexibility up front.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. OregonNo program in the country owns a better quarterback situation than the Ducks after Dante Moore's decision to skip the 2026 NFL Draft and return to school. Nebraska transfer Dylan Raiola is behind him, along with a couple of guys the coaching staff feels great about in Akili Smith Jr. and Brock Thomas. As freshmen last season, Jordon Davison and Dierre Hill Jr. showed out in the backfield and are anxious to take on featured roles. The biggest loss on offense is tight end Kenyon Sadiq -- a projected first-rounder. Jamari Johnson will get the first crack at matching his production at the position. Dakorien Moore, Jeremiah McClellan and Evan Stewart return as featured options at wideout. There might be slight statistical drop off with elite offensive coordinator Will Stein taking over at Kentucky, but Oregon has proved annually under Dan Lanning that this offense is a tough one to contain.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Notre DameThere will be no Jeremiyah Love or Jadarian Price to rescue the offense when needed next season, but Fighting Irish offensive coordinator Mike Denbrock has little reason to panic. After losing the first two starts of his career, C.J. Carr responded with 10 consecutive wins, finishing with 2,741 yards and 24 touchdowns. He was tied for No. 2 in the country in yards per attempt (9.4) and fifth in passer rating (168.06).\nAneyas Williams is expected to receive the first reps at running back, though Notre Dame could opt for a committee approach in 2026.Ohio State transfers Mylan Graham and Quincy Porter join a talented group of pass-catchers that includes Jaden Greathouse and Jordan Faison, who led the team in receptions and receiving yards as a junior.And if there is one position group Notre Dame rarely worries about, it is the offensive line. The Fighting Irish are consistently well-coached up front and typically set the tone in the trenches. With a favorable schedule ahead, this offense should post significant numbers throughout 2026.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. LSUWhen you assemble the nation's top-ranked transfer portal class and commit every available resource to making Year 1 under Lane Kiffin a success, the expectation is immediate production.In addition to landing former Arizona State quarterback Sam Leavitt, Kiffin added USC signal-caller Husan Longstreet and overhauled LSU's wide receiver room with 12 newcomers. The offensive line also projects as a major strength, anchored by five-star Colorado transfer Jordan Seaton. That unit must improve after uneven play last fall, when the Tigers struggled at times to protect Garrett Nussmeier and failed to meet lofty preseason expectations.Tight end Trey'Dez Green returns as a proven playmaker, and Harlem Berry -- the No. 1 running back in the 2025 recruiting cycle -- opted to remain with the program to see what Kiffin and his staff can build.\nKiffin engineered a rapid offensive turnaround at Ole Miss with tempo and efficiency. He will attempt to replicate that formula in Baton Rouge after bringing offensive coordinator Charlie Weis Jr. and several assistants with him.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    8. Texas TechTexas Tech's CFP shutout loss to Oregon left a bitter taste inside the program, a stark offensive failure that set the offseason narrative. Coach Joey McGuire quickly identified and addressed his offensive needs needs during this transfer portal cycle, adding Cincinnati quarterback Brendan Sorsby and four wide receivers, including two from Power Four programs. Another strong portal class positions Texas Tech to compete for a Big 12 championship and a playoff berth -- provided the offense performs at a high level, especially given personnel losses on defense. In 2025, the Red Raiders often leaned on their defense to make plays, a luxury they may not have next fall.Optimism rests partly on a talented backfield anchored by returning contributors Cameron Dickey, J'Koby Williams and Quinten Joyner, who will be counted on to lift the offense next season.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    9. Ole MissWith quarterback Trinidad Chambliss receiving an injunction to play a sixth season, the Rebels look like a juggernaut in 2026.. Auburn transfer Deuce Knight was once an insurance policy, set to take over under center if Chambliss' court challenge fell through. Now he'll be a luxury. Retaining college football's most potent running back also helps after Kewan Lacy stiff-armed pursuit by LSU and Kiffin to stay with the Rebels. He's a 1,400-yard rusher who scored an SEC-leading 23 touchdowns last fall.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    10. Oklahoma StateEric Morris fielded the nation's top total offense (512 yards per game) and scoring average (45.1 points) at North Texas last year. Transitioning from the Group of Six to the Power Four presents a new challenge, but Morris's system is proven -- and he persuaded his two best North Texas players to follow him.Oklahoma State could emerge as college football's most-improved team thanks to Morris and a top-10 transfer class, highlighted by quarterback Drew Mestemaker and tailback Caleb Hawkins. The Cowboys are poised for multiple high-scoring Big 12 shootouts, with plenty of fireworks and eye-popping numbers expected from their all-conference-caliber offensive talent.\n            ",

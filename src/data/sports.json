    "body": "\n        The first PGA Signature Event of the season arrives this week as the 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am unfolds at the iconic Pebble Beach Golf Links in Pebble Beach, Calif. Rory McIlroy won this event in 2025, and he's set to make his season debut this week after skipping the first four tournaments. McIlroy is +1400 in the 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am odds from FanDuel Sportsbook, trailing only favorite Scottie Scheffler (+300).Other Pebble Beach contenders include Tommy Fleetwood (+2200) and Justin Rose, Si Woo Kim and Xander Schauffele all at +2500. The players who went to a playoff at the WM Phoenix Open -- Hideki Matsuyama and Chris Gotterup -- are both close behind at +3000. Before locking in any 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am picks, or making any PGA DFS picks on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, simulated every PGA Tour event 10,000 times and reveals golf betting picks that have a history of being extremely profitable. This same model has also nailed a whopping 16 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- as well as this year's PGA Championship and Open Championship. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting sites. \nNew users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Now that the 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am field is locked in, the model simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard. 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am predictions One major surprise the model is calling for at the WM Phoenix Open 2026: Gotterup, who has won two of the three events he's played in this year, including the WM Phoenix Open last week, doesn't even finish in the top 10 this week. He's a golfer to avoid in Pebble Beach bets. Gotteup has never played in this event before, so the model is not ready to treat him like a top-10 contender despite the fact that he's getting +3000 odds -- the same as Maysuyama and Xander Schuaffele. See who else to fade here. \nAnother surprise: The model is extremely high on Kim (+2700). Kim has been one of the hottest golfers on Tour so far this year, finishing no worse than T11 in his four events. He's been T6 or better in his last three events, and is coming off a T3 at the WM Phoenix Open and a T2 the prior week at the Farmers Insurance Open. He's also finished in the top 15 in this event in two straight seasons. See who else to pick here. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $100 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:How to make 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am picksThe model is also targeting four longshots of +3000 or longer as top-10 contenders, including one huge +5000 sleeper. You can only see the model's picks here. \nWho will win the 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, and which longshots will stun the golfing world?

With a collection of proven Olympic veterans and rising stars, the Americans have rolled through their first three games of the preliminary round.Team USA improved to 3-0-0-0 with a 5-0 blowout win over Switzerland on Monday. The U.S. has now outscored its opponents by a combined score of 15-1 at these Olympics, and the team turned in its second consecutive shutout effort after blanking Finland on Sunday.The Americans got off to a decent start, but Swiss goalie Andrea Brandli held strong for a while, but the dam broke eventually. First-time Olympian Haley Winn got the scoring started in the first period, and the next two goals were also scored by Olympic rookies in Joy Dunne and Hannah Bilka. Gwyneth Phillips turned in a sparkling 21-save performance in goal.The standout from Team USA's domination of Switzerland was defenseman Caroline Harvey. The Wisconsin star had a three-point game, and her lone goal was a beauty. She blew by a Swiss defender, faked a shot and put a silky deke on Brandli for the tally.\nThis win sets the stage for Tuesday's showdown with Canada, which was in the process of dismantling Czechia while the U.S. handled Switzerland. It may only be a preliminary round game, but the winner of Tuesday's matchup will have the inside track for a gold medal.Canada and United States are the only two countries that have won gold in women's ice hockey since the event was added to the Olympics in 1998. The Americans won that inaugural year in Nagano, then endured four straight Canadian victories until 2018, when Team USA struck back with a dramatic overtime win to capture gold in Pyeongchang.The Americans and Canadians will write another chapter in their heated rivalry on Tuesday.\nU.S. women's hockey scheduleAll times EasternPreliminary roundThursday, Feb. 5: USA 5, Czechia 1 Saturday, Feb. 7: USA 5, Finland 0Monday, Feb. 9: USA 5, Switzerland 0USA vs. Canada | Tuesday, Feb. 10 | 2:10 p.m. | USA NetworkQuarterfinalTBD vs. TBD | Friday, Feb. 13 | 3:10 p.m. | TBDSemifinalTBD vs. TBD | Monday, Feb. 16 | 10:40 a.m. | TBDBronze medal game\nTBD vs. TBD | Thursday, Feb. 19 | 8:40 a.m. | TBDGold medal gameTBD vs. TBD | Thursday, Feb. 19 | 1:10 p.m. | TBD\n            \n    ",

The 1976 team -- Knight's first national championship squad -- remains the most recent Division I men's basketball team to go undefeated, finishing the year with a 32-0 record. Knight, who passed away in 2023 at the age of 83, posted a 662-339 during his time at Indiana that included two more national titles (in 1981 and 1987), five Final Four appearances and 24 NCAA Tournament appearances. He is a member Naismith Hall of Fame, the National College Basketball Hall of Fame, and the IU Athletics Hall of Fame. The announcement of the commission of Knight's statue was made on the night where members of the 1976 team were honored at Assembly Hall. \nThe announcement of the statue comes just over 25 years after Knight's run at Indiana ended on a tumultuous note. In September of 2000, Knight was relieved of his duties after violating a \"zero-tolerance\" policy regarding his behavior. Knight and the school had been under the microscope for months after a former player claimed he had been chocked by Knight during a practice several years earlier. A video later surfaced that appeared to show Knight placing a hand on said player. Many Indiana fans were outraged at the school's decision to fire Knight, who finished his coaching career with a largely successful, seven-year run at Texas Tech that included a Sweet 16 appearance in 2005. Knight, who retired from coaching in 2008, kept his distance from Indiana during his first dozen years of retirement. \n\"Well, I think that I've always really enjoyed the fans, and I always will,\" Knight told Dan Patrick in 2017. \"On my dying day, I will think about how great the fans at Indiana were. As far as the hierarchy at Indiana University at that time, I have absolutely no respect whatsoever with those people. That in mind, I have no interest in ever going back to that university.\"The relationship did repair itself to the point where Knight did return to Assembly Hall in February of 2020 to honor the 1980 Big Ten championship team. Knight and his former players received a thunderous ovation from fans who had waited nearly 20 years to give the old coach a proper sendoff. \nThe statue announcement is confirmation that the school will continue to honor Knight's legacy as one of the most successful coaches in basketball history. \n\"Coach Knight's influence on the game of basketball is immeasurable, but his impact on this university and Hoosier basketball fans is even deeper,\" said IU vice president and director of intercollegiate athletics  Scott Dolson. \"On a personal level, having started my career here as a student manager under Coach Knight, I saw firsthand the unparalleled standard of excellence he demanded. He taught me, and countless others, that success is the result of meticulous preparation and unwavering discipline. \"This statue will be a well-deserved tribute to a man who didn't just win games; he changed how the sport is played.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        With the NFL season officially over, sports bettors will take a closer look at the hardwood, and the current DraftKings promo code gives new users $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins. Monday features a 10-game NBA slate, including the Los Angeles Lakers hosting the Oklahoma City Thunder at 10 p.m. ET. Both teams will be without their leading scorers, with Thunder guard and reigning NBA MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (foot) out and Lakers superstar guard Luka Doncic (hamstring) out, but NBA legend LeBron James isn't on the injury report, and the Lakers are coming off a 103-97 win over the Warriors on Saturday without Doncic. Despite SGA being out, the Lakers are still underdogs, and the SportsLine Projection Model sees value in that. The model is backing the Lakers as 6.5-point underdogs as one of its Monday NBA best bets at DraftKings. The over/under for total points scored in Lakers vs. Thunder is 222.5.The model is also backing the Miami Heat to cover as 7.5-point favorites against the Utah Jazz, and one of SportsLine's top experts has locked in a college basketball bet on Xavier vs. No. 22 St. John's at 6:30 p.m. ET. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every NBA game 10,000 times and has returned well over $10,000 in betting profit for $100 players on its top-rated NBA picks over the past eight-plus seasons. The model enters the week before the NBA All-Star break on a sizzling 38-17 roll on top-rated NBA spread picks dating back to last season. Anyone following its NBA betting advice at sportsbooks and on betting apps could have seen huge returns.Monday best bets at DraftKings SportsbookSt. John's (-15.5) vs. Xavier (-110)Heat (-7.5) vs. Jazz (-112)Lakers (+6.5) vs. Thunder (-105)Combining the three picks into an Monday parlay at DraftKings would result in a payout of +605 (risk $100 to win $605). Bet it at DraftKings here: (Odds subject to change):\nSt. John's (-15.5) vs. Xavier (-110)\"Usually, we'd hesitate to go with a team after such a rousing win at St John's did against Big East leader UConn on Friday. Not tonight, however, as we suspect there is little chance the Red Storm (nine wins in a row) suddenly goes flat against Papa Rick Pitino's son Richard and his Xavier, which already took a good shot at the Johnnies in Cincinnati two weeks ago and put a scare into Papa in an 88-83 St John's escape,\" legendary SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall said. \"The Musketeers, however, have absorbed a couple of heavy losses since and been outclassed multiple times on the Big East trail, and dealing with the Storm's excellent balance, near 85 ppg offense, and productive frontliners Zuby Ejifor and Bryce Hopkins looms difficult.\" Back St. John's to cover at DraftKings here:Heat (-7.5) vs. Jazz (-112)The Heat are coming off a 132-101 victory over the Wizards on Saturday, and similar to Washington, Utah isn't exactly playing the most inspiring basketball in a 16-37 season. The Jazz are 2-12 over their last 14 games, with eight of those losses coming by double digits. Meanwhile, five of the Heat's last six wins have come by double digits. Although the Heat are just 6-5 over their last 11 games, it's hard to picture them losing straight up to the Jazz, and given the way their wins have gone recently, the model likes their chances of a win by a wider margin. Bam Adebayo had 22 points and eight rebounds on Saturday, as one of seven Heat players to finish with at least 10 points. The model projects the Heat to cover in 67% of simulations. Back the Heat to cover at DraftKings here:Lakers (+6.5) vs. Thunder (-105)The Thunder have struggled without SGA, while the Lakers have continued to win without Luka Doncic over the start of their current absences. The Thunder are 1-2 with SGA sidelined with his current foot injury, while the Lakers rallied from trailing when Doncic exited on Thursday with a hamstring injury to defeat the 76ers. Then, the Lakers defeated the Warriors on Saturday. Austin Reaves had 35 points on Thursday, and he's averaging 26.1 points per game this season. LeBron James continues to showcase his greatness, including posting 20 points, seven rebounds and 10 assists on Saturday with Doncic out. James has scored at least 20 points in four of his last five games. The Lakers host OKC on Monday, and they are 14-8 in Los Angeles this season. The model projects the Lakers to compete with the NBA-leading Thunder, who are missing SGA, with the Lakers covering in 63% of simulations. Back the Lakers to cover at DraftKings here:\nWant more NBA, college basketball picks on Monday?You've seen some of the model's Monday best bets.

In true Monday morning quarterback fashion, there has been a debate over whether Vonn should have even attempted to fix skis after she tore her ACL two weeks ago.

    "body": "\n        Mornings for golf fans frequently consist of brewing a pot of coffee, flipping on PGA Tour coverage and answering emails with one eye on the golf in the background. Dew still rests on fairways as perfectly manicured golf courses, ideal weather and birdsong flood living rooms and in-home offices. Fans' appetites are whetted by coverage of rookies before marquee groupings finally make their way to the first tee.For some, that routine has been altered this year, largely due to Patrick Reed.The 2018 Masters champion has entered the winner's circle in two of his last three DP World Tour starts with wins at the Dubai Desert Classic and Qatar Masters sandwiching a playoff loss at the Bahrain Championship. Reed has ascended to No. 1 in the Race to Dubai, all but assuring him a full-time PGA Tour card for the 2027 season; those are offered to every golfer who finishes inside the top 10 of the season-long race, not otherwise exempt.Reed's point total has already reached 2,260 through four tournaments. Last season, Jordan Smith claimed the final PGA Tour card through the Race to Dubai with just 2,203 points. The year prior, Tom McKibbin did the same with 1,897 points (though he ultimately decided to play for LIV Golf instead).Reed will climb the priority rankings for the 2027 season after banking on using a past champions' exemption to play some PGA Tour events after deciding not to re-sign with LIV Golf. That will no longer be necessary as the American has jumped to No. 17 in the Official World Golf Rankings ahead of names like Collin Morikawa, Ludvig Åberg, Cameron Young and Matt Fitzpatrick.\nAs it goes with runs of form like this, fans now want to watch Reed on the biggest stage (PGA Tour), wondering why he's not already back on the circuit. A Returning Player Program got conjured out of thin air to bring Brooks Koepka back to the PGA Tour, but Reed does not come close to meeting those marks based on his past success.But you know what? That's OK. After all, what Reed is doing ... that's rare ... and you can follow his journey just the same.Reed's travel itinerary for the last four weeks featured Dubai (twice), Bahrain and Qatar. The ultimate grinder did just that through the Middle East. Next up are Africa and Asia before the schedule settles into its European stretch.\nThe 35-year-old could become the second American to ever win the Race to Dubai (Collin Morikawa, 2021, playing 10 tournaments) and first to do it while participating in a full-time DP World Tour schedule. Not since Tommy Fleetwood in 2017 has a Race to Dubai champion played more than 20 DP World Tour events.Reed could become a thorn in Rory McIlroy's side again as the five-time major champion looks to win his fifth straight Race to Dubai and tie Colin Montgomerie for the most all-time with eight. McIlroy averaged 5,755 points in his run of four straight season-long crowns; Reed is roughly 40% of the way there.Remember their rivalry? The Ryder Cup singles match in 2016 with the hooting, hollering, shushing and finger waving? Reed throwing a tee at McIlroy on the range in Dubai a few seasons back? That has the potential to be rekindled. Those two could share meaningful tee times on a stage that is not a major championship.\nIt would be great if this was happening on the PGA Tour, but all it will take is a shift in your morning schedule to watch Reed accumulate point after point and trophy after trophy on golf courses of which you may not be familiar, against players whose names you may not be able to pronounce.Take the time to watch a man going about it his own way, making his way back through the only way he knows how. In the process, Patrick Reed might even win you over, too.\n            ",

Tatum has been getting some individual on-court work in at the Celtics training facility, but moving to team drills is a significant step in the rehab process. That he's already to group activity on the court prior to the NBA All-Star break will only fuel speculation that the six-time All-Star forward could potentially return before the end of the 2025-26 season. Tatum stated prior to the season that he wouldn't rule out playing this year, but recently noted that his focus is on making sure he gets this rehab process right the first time and doesn't return too early and cause any setbacks. When Tatum got hurt, the general consensus was that the 2025-26 season would be a lost one for Boston. They were aggressive in tearing down the roster and moving some key pieces from the team that won a title two years ago, trading the likes of Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porzingis and let Al Horford walk in free agency. \nDespite making moves to shed salary and get under the tax at the trade deadline, the Celtics are tied for second in the Eastern Conference with the New York Knicks at 34-19. Jaylen Brown has played at an All-NBA level, players that were once viewed as depth pieces have stepped into key roles and Joe Mazzulla has gotten full buy-in from this team to keep them not only in the playoff hunt, but near the top of the conference. As a result of that success, the potential for Tatum to return to the floor this season feels more real than ever. Part of the reason most wrote off Tatum possibly playing at all this season was there figured to be little reward to outweigh the risk of coming back too soon, given Boston was projected as a play-in team prior to the season. With the East appearing wide open and the Celtics seeming set to have homecourt in at least the first round of the playoffs, Tatum returning could turn this Boston team into a legitimate title contender.That will certainly factor into the thinking of whether he returns to action this year, but Tatum and the Celtics will keep their main focus on his long-term health. They'll see how his body reacts to doing more on-court work and practicing with the G League team over the coming months. At some point they will want to make an official determination on his immediate future this season, and one would guess the Celtics would want Tatum to be able to play some regular season minutes rather than jumping straight in to the intensity of the playoffs. \nFor now, he'll get some work in with the G League roster and keep trying to check off all the necessary boxes before that decision gets made. Given his rehab timeline thus far, a return this season remains a legitimate possibility, which would make the playoff race in the East even more intriguing. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Las Vegas Raiders announced Monday they hired Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak as coach. The deal had reportedly been in the works for more than a week but could not become official until after Super Bowl 60. With Kubiak's quest for a championship now complete, his tenure in Las Vegas is underway.Kubiak, 38, directed one of the NFL's top offenses with Sam Darnold at the helm. Prior to his lone year in Seattle, Kubiak was the New Orleans Saints' offensive coordinator in 2024, and before that, he worked as the San Francisco 49ers' pass game coordinator under Kyle Shanahan. He also worked under his own father, Gary Kubiak, as well as Kevin Stefanski with the Minnesota Vikings. Several aspects of his father's offense as well as the Shanahan and Stefanski offenses are seen in his offenses. Seattle ranked second this season in under-center rate and seventh in play-action dropback rate. The Seahawks led the NFL in yards per attempt on play action passes, too.Overall, the Seahawks' offense was eighth in points per game and yards per game, sixth in yards per play and second in net yards per pass attempt. Darnold and Jaxon Smith-Njigba (NFL-leading 1,793 receiving yards) both made the Pro Bowl.With Klint in line to become coach, he and Gary Kubiak will be the 10th father-son head-coaching duo in NFL history, joining ...Brian and Marty SchottenheimerKyle and Mike ShanahanBrian and Bill CallahanDave and Don ShulaRex and Buddy RyanWade and Bum PhillipsMike and Dick NolanJim Mora Jr. and Jim MoraJohn and Jim FasselSan Francisco 49ers offensive coordinator Klay Kubiak -- Klint's brother -- also received some head-coaching interest this hiring cycle.\nKlint Kubiak, who also interviewed with the Arizona Cardinals, will have his work cut out for him in Las Vegas. The Raiders come off a dismal 3-14 campaign under Pete Carroll, who got fired after one season. On the bright side, the Raiders own the No. 1 pick in the NFL Draft and are widely expected to select Heisman Trophy- and national championship-winning Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza. The Raiders have several holes to fill, though, and the offensive line will be the biggest question mark. Pro Football Focus graded Las Vegas as the 28th-best pass-blocking unit and the 30th-best run-blocking unit.There is some young talent, though, led by tight end Brock Bowers and running Ashton Jeanty. Bowers caught 112 passes for 1,194 yards as a rookie in 2024 before an injury-impacted 2024. Jeanty, meanwhile, finished with 1,321 yards from scrimmage and 10 touchdowns even with underwhelming surroundings. He recorded 188 yards from scrimmage and two touchdowns in Week 16 against the Houston Texans, one of the league's premier defenses.\nOn defense, one of Kubiak's first tasks will be dealing with the Maxx Crosby situation. Crosby was shelved for the season late due to a knee injury, a decision with which Crosby vehemently disagreed and left him pondering his future. Kubiak could aim to bring some Seattle defensive coaches with him to Las Vegas as he builds his staff.\n            ",

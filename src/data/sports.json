    "body": "\nThe Baltimore Ravens look to keep their slim playoff hopes alive when they battle the Green Bay Packers on Saturday night. The Ravens (7-8), who trail first-place Pittsburgh by two games in the AFC North, need to win out and have Pittsburgh lose to the Browns in Week 17 to make the playoffs. The Packers (9-5-1), who are 1.5 games behind Chicago for the NFC North lead, clinched a playoff spot on Thursday when the Vikings upset the Lions. Both teams have major question marks at quarterback. Green Bay QB Jordan Love (concussion/shoulder) is inactive, while backup Malik Willis (shoulder/illness) is active. Lamar Jackson (back) is inactive for Baltimore, putting Tyler Huntley in line to start. Kickoff from Lambeau Field in Green Bay is set for 8 p.m. ET. The Packers are 2.5-point favorites in the latest Ravens vs. Packers odds, while the over/under for total points scored is 38 via DraftKings Sportsbook, a line that has dropped seven points from the opener due to the injuries.

When the over/under is below 50 for the Cougars, the Over is 7-1. Additionally, UH has seen the Over hit in five of six games when favored this season.

Williams said something to Alvarado who grabbed the Suns' big man and the two started going at it, with Alvarado throwing punches and connecting with a right hook. \nAlvarado and Williams were both ejected for their roles in the scrap, which was a far more legitimate fight than most tussles we see happen on an NBA court. The best part of it all was Jordan Poole's face in the background when Alvarado landed the punch (0:35 mark of the above video). \nAlvarado was still hot after getting pulled away and sprinted to the back, seemingly ready to continue things in the hallway by the locker rooms. He will likely be facing fairly stiff punishment from the NBA as the one to escalate things and connecting on a punch. Williams was less aggressive in his role in the brouhaha and will await the NBA's decision on whether he'll get further discipline than the ejection. \nThe Suns went on to win, 123-114, after the fight to notch back-to-back wins in New Orleans and improve to 18-13 on the season, as they battle for a playoff spot in the West. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        With the Texans' 20-16 win over the Chargers on Saturday night to improve to 11-5, Houston clinched a spot in the playoffs, eliminating the 8-7 Colts in the process. Indianapolis becomes just the sixth team in NFL history to start a season 8-2 and miss the playoffs and the first to do so since the 1995 Raiders. That's not the kind of history any team hopes to make, and it underscores what a disaster the second half of the season has been for Indianapolis. They began the season as the NFL's best story, with Daniel Jones getting a redemption arc with a fresh start in Indy, leading an offense that was the best in the league. With the playoffs firmly in their sights and an AFC lacking a dominant force, the Colts understandably took a swing at the trade deadline, shipping two first round picks to the Jets for star corner Sauce Gardner. However, things went off the rails for Indianapolis shortly after the trade deadline, leaving the franchise and its fans worried about its immediate future. Jones was hobbled with a fractured fibula, Gardner got injured early in his third game in Indy and Jones eventually tore his Achilles to end his season. As injuries have piled up, the Colts have lost their last five games, the last two coming with 44-year-old Philip Rivers playing quarterback after he signed with the teams after being retired for nearly five years. \nIt has been the ultimate disaster scenario for Indy. Losing Jones to a catastrophic injury leads to questions about whether he'll be the short or long-term answer at quarterback. However, with the Jets owning their 2026 (and 2027) first-round pick from the Gardner trade, they won't even have the option of taking a swing in April's NFL Draft. It's an unfortunate situation, especially because we so rarely see teams truly try to capitalize on a surprising seasons. The Colts took a huge swing and struck out, and now will serve as a cautionary tale for future front offices wondering if it's worth doing the same. It being the Texans that eliminated them officially only adds salt to the wound in Indy. Not only are the Texans division rivals, but Houston makes a bit of history themselves by becoming just the seventh team to make the postseason after an 0-3 start. The last team to do it? The 2018 Texans. \nThe Colts will play a key role in exactly where Houston ends up in the AFC seeding. The Colts finish the season against the Jaguars in Week 17 and the Texans in Week 18, with Houston needing a win over Indy next week and a Jacksonville loss against either the Colts or Titans in the final two weeks to win the AFC South. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        We're down to eight teams remaining in the 2025 College Football Playoff, with the top four seeds set to take the field for the first time since conference championship weekend. 'Tis the season for a robust slate of bowl games as well, so there's no shortage of picks and predictions to get to while you wrap up your final online shopping decisions.Does anyone else hold a perfect playoff bracket through the first round? I won't pat myself on the back for too long with several seismic quarterfinal matchups looming -- including a couple that would send a national tremor if underdogs prevail. One of the most intriguing tilts remaining features Indiana's Curt Cignetti, who plans to lean on lessons learned from Nick Saban as he tries to thwart Alabama.In addition to the CFP's Cotton, Orange, Sugar and Rose bowls next weekend, there are 24 additional bowl games scheduled through Jan. 2. The Holiday Bowl between Arizona and SMU is the final postseason game before the playoff semifinals at the Fiesta and Peach bowls on Jan. 8-9, with the winners advancing to the national championship game on Jan. 19 in Miami.College Football Playoff quarterfinalsCotton Bowl: Miami vs. Ohio State -9.5 (Dec. 31)\nHummer (Miami +9.5): I'm not going to pick Miami to upset my national title pick. But that's a very appealing line for a Miami cover. Ohio State can usually suffocate opponents with its line play and speed on the outside. That's not going to happen with Miami, a team with one of the best o-lines and pass rush groups in the FBS. I certainly trust Ohio State's offense a bit more in this matchup, but even that unit has a question mark associated with it after the way it struggled against Indiana. This will be a rock fight for most of the day, but the Buckeyes pull away in the second half. … Ohio State 27, Miami 20.\nCrawford (Miami +9.5): Should I stay with the Hurricanes after taking Miami on the moneyline at Texas A&M? I'm not ready to pick against my national championship selection just yet, but Mario Cristobal's defense could present a number of problems for Julian Sayin and the Buckeyes' passing game. Miami stymied the Aggies with a variety of looks and consistently frustrated Marcel Reed — film that Ryan Day and his staff will study closely ahead of this matchup. Outside of a potential rematch with Indiana in the national championship game, this may be the toughest test Ohio State faces in the bracket. This one could look a lot like the Big Ten Championship Game, a 12-round slugfest dictated by defense and timely stops. ... Ohio State 20, Miami 14.Orange Bowl: Oregon -1.5 vs. Texas Tech (Jan. 1)Hummer (Texas Tech +1.5): The most interesting matchup of the semifinals, at least to me. This game pits Texas Tech's elite front seven against Oregon's blazing speed. It'll also be interesting to see how Texas Tech adjusts to a different quality of opponent than they've seen week to week in the Big 12. On paper, these teams are evenly matched. They're one-two nationally in explosive plays of 20-plus yards. They're also tied for fourth nationally in defending them. There are four future draft picks on Texas Tech's d-line. There are multiple future draft picks on Oregon's o-line. Expect Oregon to get the ball out of Dante Moore's hands quickly to try to take advantage of playmakers in space. Expect Texas Tech to do the same. This game is going to be close. But I'm going with the Red Raiders. I think they're slightly better in the trenches and make enough big plays to pull it out. … Texas Tech 21, Oregon 20.Crawford (Texas Tech +1.5): After going 4-0 in the opening round, my only bracket change from my pre-playoff fill-out comes in this quarterfinal between Oregon and Texas Tech. With Joey McGuire and the Red Raiders afforded nearly a month to prepare for Oregon's offense, we could see one of the nation's top defenses operating at its peak at AT&T Stadium. There's always some concern that Behren Morton could struggle in a high-leverage moment, given the number of blowouts Texas Tech enjoyed against Big 12 competition this season, but the Red Raiders are built to beat a team like Oregon. That second-half performance against James Madison should have been a wake-up call for the Ducks. Another showing like that against an elite opponent such as Texas Tech could lead to a lopsided final. ... Texas Tech 30, Oregon 24.\nRose Bowl: Alabama vs. Indiana -6.5\nHummer (Alabama +6.5):Imagine explaining this line to someone three years ago, before Nick Saban retired. But as Curt Cignetti would tell you: \"Google me.\" Indiana is the justified favorite entering this matchup, and as is always the case with Alabama, it largely hinges on how Ty Simpson plays. The Tide can struggle to run the ball -- ranking 72nd nationally in success rate -- and Indiana owns a top-10 run defense. That means Simpson will have to carry the load. He's capable of that, but Indiana is also an excellent pass defense and fields one of the nation's most efficient offenses. It's a brutal matchup for Alabama, which will need to play near-perfect football -- something it hasn't done consistently this season. It still feels strange to write, but give me the Hoosiers. They've been the most consistent team all year, and that matters. … Indiana 27, Alabama 24.Crawford (Indiana -6.5): If there's a chance of another playoff runaway in the quarterfinals, it could come here for the Crimson Tide. There's no matchup an Alabama fan should view as favorable in this spot against the Heisman winner and a strong defensive group, but perhaps Kalen DeBoer can thrive again in the underdog role. His teams have consistently responded to adversity, and the distraction surrounding the Michigan rumors appears to be settling, which helps. Alabama spotted Oklahoma 17 points in its last outing, and a repeat of that would mean a long flight home to Tuscaloosa. As the unblemished top seed, there's pressure on Indiana as well. Oregon fell in a similar spot last fall at the Rose Bowl after Ohio State won its first-round matchup with Tennessee. ... Indiana 31, Alabama 17.Sugar Bowl: Ole Miss vs. Georgia -7.5\nHummer (Georgia -7.5):  Two regular-season rematches in a row for Ole Miss is an interesting wrinkle of the 12-team era. Georgia won the first meeting, storming back late in a game it outgained the Rebels by 159 yards. The issue for Ole Miss this time is that it's a worse team now than it was then. The rosters are largely the same, but the coaching staff has been in constant flux. Meanwhile, Georgia is playing its best football of the season after finding its footing defensively, allowing just 26 total points over its last three games against Power Four competition -- Texas, Georgia Tech and Alabama. The Bulldogs head to Louisiana and secure a decisive win.… Georgia 34, Ole Miss 24.\nCrawford (Ole Miss +7.5): You have to believe you can slay a giant before actually doing so, and Ole Miss carries that confidence into New Orleans. The Rebels produced a near-perfect game plan against Georgia in an October loss, scoring touchdowns on their first five possessions in a 43-35 defeat. Georgia answered by scoring 17 points in the fourth quarter to erase a nine-point deficit. Trinidad Chambliss committed no turnovers in that matchup, but a pair of fourth-quarter three-and-outs proved costly, particularly with the defense unable to get stops. Ole Miss will need significantly better play on that side of the ball to knock off the SEC champions and advance to the semifinals. ... Georgia 27, Ole Miss 20.Remaining bowl games (Dec. 24-Jan. 2)With all non-playoff bowl game wagers, be sure to study the rosters and coaching staffs each team brings into its postseason matchup. Several two-deeps have been decimated by player opt-outs and transfer portal departures, with more than a dozen programs also navigating leadership changes.Motivation always matters, too. How many of these teams truly want to be there and are looking to finish the season on a high note heading into 2026? Like most insiders, oddsmakers are making educated guesses on many of these lines. Play accordingly -- and smart.\nBirmingham Bowl: Georgia Southern -7.5 vs. Appalachian StateHummer: Appalachian State +7.5Crawford: Appalachian State +7.5Independence Bowl: Coastal Carolina vs. La.

    "body": "\n        Chelsea had Aston Villa right where they wanted them, that was until Unai Emery's adjustments and brilliance from Ollie Watkins led the visitors to a 2-1 victory at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. Make no mistake, with this win is further proof that Villa are Premier League title contenders.  Not picking up their first league win of the season until the end of September, facing Fulham, Villa have been unstoppable since, racking up 13 consecutive wins in all competitions, despite defying the numbers even in this match. Chelsea may have only put three shots on goal, but they were able to generate 2.14 expected goals, most of which came from Joao Pedro's goal from close range in the first half. In the second half, Watkins, Jadon Sancho, and Amadou Onana entered, and it changed everything for Villa. They scored both their goals, outshot Chelsea 11-4 and also had an xG of 1.40 to 0.16. Changes like that come right down to tactics, and there are few better at preparing a team of perceived underdogs to be competitive in a match than Unai Emery.He's taken down Arsenal, Manchester City, and now Chelsea in order to draw within three points of the Gunners as we turn to the new year. The title race is very much on, and even Villa's numbers are beginning to improve as they have the fourth-best goal difference in the league, thanks to Emi Martinez and the defense allowing only 19 goals in 18 matches played this season. Scoring four goals while allowing two in their last two matches will do that, and it sets up quite a clash on the horizon. Villa can enter the new year top of the league if they can take down Arsenal again away at the Emirates Stadium on Dec. 30.All eyes would already be on that match with Emery facing a team that he formerly coached, but when Villa haven't won the league since 1981 before the Premier League was formed, and despite being an unlikely suspect outperforming their numbers on all fronts, it's time to take Villa seriously. They've already taken large strides upon returning to the Champions League for next season, opening a seven-point lead over fourth-place Liverpool with their win on Saturday. \nIt has been a true team effort, but after the defense, winger Morgan Rodgers taking a step forward has gone a long way to powering this team. With seven goals and three assists, he is also pushing to represent England at the World Cup in 2026 and is certainly on the right track. With an upcoming schedule including Arsenal and Crystal Palace, Villa's title credentials will continue to be tested during the upcoming stretch, but it's nothing that Emery won't have them prepared for. Despite that, Villa's manager is playing down their chances of winning the title, instead suggesting that his team are locked in a battle for fourth place.\"I am feeling that we are competing for Europe, not competing in the league with Man City and Arsenal,\" Emery said. \"We have played 18 matches and have 20 to play. Teams like Liverpool, Chelsea, and Manchester United -- we must compete with them. We must be consistent over 38 matches.\"\nMaking sure that his team doesn't get ahead of themselves is something that makes sense, but even in a battle for Europe, Villa are in pole position. But numbers-wise, the title could be just beyond their reach.On one hand, only Tottenham have had a similar 10-goal overperformance of their xG, like Aston Villa, but considering their reliance on set plays, it makes sense as to why that would happen. This has become the league of set plays as teams have ensured that they make the most of every goal-scoring opportunity, but Emery was doing it before it became the rage. A manager doesn't coach four Europa League-winning sides without making the most of every opportunity, but if he's able to win the Premier League, it'd be the biggest trophy of his career to date.Villa are on track to do something special this season, and they have the leadership at the helm to get it done. With the January transfer window about to swing open, it's also a chance to add reinforcements for what could be a stretch run for the ages.\n            ",

The Presidents Day tripleheader that made headlines a year ago will not be held, and the showdown between Woods' Jupiter Links Golf Club and McIlroy's Boston Common Golf is set for Sunday, March 1 -- following the conclusion fo the PGA Tour's Congizant Classic hosted in the same city.The postseason is set for the weeks following The Tour Championship with TGL ultimately ceding way to the PGA Tour as major championship season kicks into high gear.Let's take a look at what's ahead for TGL in 2026 along with the rules of play and how the teams are comprised.\n 2026 TGL schedule All times Eastern MatchDateTimeTVMatch / Results1 \t\t\t\tSun., Dec. 28 \t\t\t\t3 p.m. \t\t\t\tABC \t\t\t\tNew York vs. Atlanta \t\t\t\t2 \t\t\t\tFri., Jan. 2 \t\t\t\t7 p.m. \t\t\t\tESPN2 \t\t\t\tBoston vs. Los Angeles \t\t\t\t3 \t\t\t\tTues., Jan. 6 \t\t\t\t5 p.m. \t\t\t\tESPN \t\t\t\tThe Bay vs. Atlanta \t\t\t\t4 \t\t\t\tTues., Jan. 13 \t\t\t\t7 p.m. \t\t\t\tESPN \t\t\t\tJupiter Links vs. New York \t\t\t\t5 \t\t\t\tTues., Jan. 20 \t\t\t\t7 p.m. \t\t\t\tESPN \t\t\t\tJupiter Links vs. Los Angeles \t\t\t\t6 \t\t\t\tMon., Jan. 26 \t\t\t\t7 p.m. \t\t\t\tESPN2 \t\t\t\tBoston vs. The Bay \t\t\t\t7 \t\t\t\tMon., Feb. 2 \t\t\t\t5 p.m.  \t\t\t\tESPN \t\t\t\tAtlanta vs. Jupiter Links \t\t\t\t8 \t\t\t\tMon., Feb. 9 \t\t\t\t7 p.m. \t\t\t\tESPN2 \t\t\t\tThe Bay vs. Los Angeles \t\t\t\t9 \t\t\t\tMon., Feb. 23 \t\t\t\t5 p.m. \t\t\t\tESPN \t\t\t\tAtlanta vs. Boston \t\t\t\t10 \t\t\t\tMon., Feb. 23 \t\t\t\t9 p.m. \t\t\t\tESPN2 \t\t\t\tLos Angeles vs. Atlanta \t\t\t\t11 \t\t\t\tTues., Feb. 24 \t\t\t\t5 p.m. \t\t\t\tESPN \t\t\t\tNew York vs. The Bay \t\t\t\t12 \t\t\t\tTues., Feb. 24 \t\t\t\t9 p.m. \t\t\t\tESPN \t\t\t\tBoston vs. New York \t\t\t\t13 \t\t\t\tSun., Mar. 1 \t\t\t\t9 p.m. \t\t\t\tESPN \t\t\t\tJupiter vs. Boston \t\t\t\t14 \t\t\t\tMon., Mar. 2 \t\t\t\t7 p.m. \t\t\t\tESPN2 \t\t\t\tLos Angeles vs. New York \t\t\t\t15 \t\t\t\tTues., Mar. 3 \t\t\t\t9 p.m. \t\t\t\tESPN \t\t\t\tThe Bay vs. Jupiter \t\t\t\tSemi 1Semi 2 \t\t\t\tTues., Mar. 17 \t\t\t\t6:30 p.m.9 p.m. \t\t\t\tESPN \t\t\t\tTBD \t\t\t\tFinals 1Finals 2Finals 3 \t\t\t\tMon., Mar. 23Tues., Mar. 24Tues., Mar. 24 \t\t\t\t9 p.m.7 p.m.9 p.m. \t\t\t\tESPN2ESPNESPN \t\t\t\tTBD \t\t\t\t TGL format TGL matches take place across 15 holes and two sessions.

A team can either accept the hammer and play that hole for two points or deny it and concede the hole. Each team has three hammers to use throughout the match. Shot clock: Players will have 40 seconds to hit their shots or face a one-stroke penalty. Timeouts: Each team has four timeouts per match -- two in Triples and two in Singles.

    "body": "\n        When No. 10 Miami and No. 2 Ohio State meet on New Year's Eve in the Cotton Bowl, it will be a postseason rematch more than two decades in the making.  The last time the Buckeyes and Hurricanes met in college football's postseason it was for the national championship in the 2003 Fiesta Bowl, ending in such a controversial Ohio State win that the ref who made the fateful pass interference call is still a household name in some circles (Terry Porter, as Miami fans will tell you). Looking for a second consecutive championship and armed with a preposterously talented roster, Miami was 11.5-point favorites against the Buckeyes in Tempe. Ohio State won 31-24 in double overtime. \nOn the final day of this year, Miami and Ohio State meet in the College Football Playoff quarterfinals, and while the stakes aren't quite as high with the winner needing two more wins to capture another national title, both programs have plenty on the line.  It's somewhat poetic that the roles are reversed from the 2003 Fiesta Bowl. This year, the Buckeyes come into the Cotton Bowl as the heavy favorites and defending national champions, looking to win back-to-back titles for the first time in school history. Miami, meanwhile, is a team trying to rekindle the glory of the past and return to the top of the sport for the first time in more than two decades.  \nBack in 2003, the Hurricanes were the favorites as the defending national champs with a stacked roster featuring loads of NFL talent. Miami's 2002 Starting Lineup Bolded text indicates future Round 1 NFL pick, italics denote All-America pick from that season.    PositionPlayerQBKen DorseyFBKyle CobiaRBWillis McGahee*WRAndre JohnsonWRKevin BeardTEKellen Winslow IILTCarlos JosephLGSherko Haji-RasouliCBrett Romberg*RGEd WilkinsRTVernon CareyDEAndrew WilliamsDTMatt WaltersDTWilliam JosephDEJerome McDougleWLBD.J. WilliamsMLBJonathan VilmaSLBHoward ClarkCBAntrel RolleCBKelly JenningsSSMaurice SikesFSSean TaylorKTodd SieversPFreddie CapshawKRRoscoe Parrish*Consensus All-AmericaIn the way of the Miami juggernaut was Ohio State, the once-storied program that had struggled to get all the way back to the mountaintop -- entering that game on a national title drought of over 30 years. \nOhio State's 31-24 win launched Buckeyes back to the top of the sport, and for the past 23 years they have maintained their place among college football's elite. The Buckeyes rarely slipped from the top 25 after their last AP national title in 1968, but could never quite get back to championship form. That changed with their dramatic Fiesta Bowl victory in 2003, and they've played in five national championship games since then, winning two.  For Miami, that game was the last time they played for a national title and the Hurricanes rather quickly fell out of the national conversation, spending the past 20 years struggling to break through on the national landscape. To put it in elementary terms, the median and mode of Miami's by-season win totals since 2003 is seven -- and the mean (average wins per season) is 7.68. Mario Cristobal has steadily changed the baseline for success in Coral Gables, though, with a 10-3 mark in 2024 and a glittery 11-2 record this season. Championship relevancy that for so long has been out of reach is quite quickly upon Miami's doorstep. \nA stunning upset of the Buckeyes on New Year's Eve would be a full-circle moment for Miami. While no one on this current Hurricanes squad remembers that 2003 Fiesta Bowl -- Carson Beck was born two months earlier, Malachi Toney four-and-a-half-years later -- the shadows of that night have haunted the program for decades. Mere mention of that game will draw a deep sigh and a lengthy rant about what could have been for the Canes (Willis McGahee's gruesome knee injury) and how it was stolen from them (a pass interference call gave Ohio State a second chance in overtime). In July of 2003, Dennis Dodd wrote up a piece for CBS Sports vindicating referee Porter's decision to throw a flag.  In the eyes of the head officiating bosses, where Porter mostly erred was in his delayed timing. \nEarlier this year Big 12 commissioner Kevin Weiberg said game films had been reviewed and that, in fact, Porter had made the right call. The Big Ten supervisor of officials, who is used by the NCAA to assign officials for bowl games, concurred this week. \tThe problem is, few people saw the actual infraction. All the replays focused on Miami defensive back Glenn Sharpe jumping for a ball in the end zone intended for Ohio State receiver Chris Gamble. \tThe penalty occurred on fourth-and-3 from the Miami 5 in the first overtime of Ohio State's 31-24 victory. At the line of scrimmage, Sharpe tried to \"jam\" Gamble and impeded his progress. When the official who apparently had the call in the end zone didn't make one, Porter came rushing from the back of the end zone to throw the flag four or five seconds after the play had ended. \t\"The timing of the flag might have looked not good,\" said Dave Parry, the Big Ten supervisor of officials, who works with the NCAA. \"Terry was probably trying to be very thorough. He signaled a push for a defensive pass interference, then a signal for holding. There is a time lapse there. When the camera showed it they didn't see the line of scrimmage. They saw the downfield play about 7 or 8 yards.\" \tPorter has been the subject of Miami fans' message board rants for months since the call. Miami's stance seems to be that while the call might have been right, it was inexcusable that Porter waited those pregnant seconds before throwing the flag after running from the back of the end zone. \t\"I replayed it in my mind,\" Porter said after the game. \"I wanted to make double-sure that it was the right call.\" \tWithout saying it was the case, Parry said this week there could have been a \"small, small little downgrade\" in Porter's evaluation for shoddy mechanics in waiting so long to make the call.  \tIt's not just the way that game ended that still burns Miami fans, but the fact that it was the last time they were ever on that stage. A win would have changed so much. The 2001 Miami team that won the title has an argument as the greatest college team ever assembled. The 2002 team wasn't far off and had they repeated with a win over the Buckeyes, perhaps the Hurricanes would've cemented themselves as the dominant force in the world of college football. Instead, and quite quickly, USC one season later began the decade's most dynastic run. Miami fans have watched as the Buckeyes and others jumped over them after that Fiesta Bowl to become the nation's dominant programs and can't help but wonder what could've been if that flag hadn't been thrown. Would the last 20 years still have played out the same way? Or would back-to-back national titles have changed their fortunes and given them a stronger foothold at the top of the sport?Miami has not finished a season in the top 10 of the AP poll since. That will almost change this year after a first round CFP victory over Texas A&M, but the Hurricanes believe they should be a national title threat, not just a top 10 finisher.  That's what Cristobal was brought in to do, and Wednesday night will be his first real chance to prove Miami is back at that level.  The old adage of \"to be the best, you have to beat the best\" will be firmly in play on Wednesday night in Dallas. Almost 23 years to the day since Ohio State did exactly that to claim the national title over a dominant Miami team, the Hurricanes will attempt to exact some revenge over the Buckeyes.  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Week 17 in the NFL is setting up to be an incredible week. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers will look to rebound against the Miami Dolphins, the New York Giants and Las Vegas Raiders will battle for the No. 1 overall pick, and the San Francisco 49ers aim to win their sixth straight game against a feisty Chicago Bears team.Who's scoring today? That's what everyone wants to know. Whether you're crafting the group-chat parlay or looking for a lesser-known name with some value, anytime TD bets have become one of the most popular wagers in the world of sports gambling. Below, we will break down five anytime TD bets to consider for Week 17. These will not be predictable choices like a Derrick Henry or Jonathan Taylor score, but they won't be wild long shots such as a team defense. Let's begin with an offense that found its rhythm last week. Odds courtesy of DraftKings Sportsbook1. WR Ja'Marr Chase, Cincinnati Bengals (-150)\nThe Arizona Cardinals have lost seven consecutive games, and rank last in scoring defense since Week 6 with 31.8 points allowed per game. Maybe more importantly, the Cards rank bottom 10 in passing defense with 224.1 yards allowed per contest. The Bengals are coming off a dominant 45-21 win over the Miami Dolphins, in which Joe Burrow threw for 309 yards and four touchdowns. While Ja'Marr Chase led Cincy with 109 yards receiving, he didn't find the end zone. This week, he will. \n\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 17 odds, predictions, expert picks: Can Panthers upset Seahawks?\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n2. WR Mike Evans, Tampa Bay Buccaneers (+140)\nMike Evans has caught 11 passes for 163 yards and a touchdown in his two games since returning from injury. The Bucs need a win against the lowly Dolphins to guarantee they remain alive in the NFC South race, and I'm predicting Baker Mayfield comes out angry after Tampa Bay dropped six out of its last seven games. Evans finds the end zone.3. RB Saquon Barkley, Philadelphia Eagles (-105)\nThe reigning NFL Offensive Player of the Year has not only scored touchdowns in three straight games, but has also crossed 122 yards rushing in two out of the last three contests. This week, Barkley faces off against one of the worst run defenses in the NFL with the Buffalo Bills. They entered this week ranked third-worst in the league, allowing 144.3 rushing yards per game. Buffalo also allows 5.4 yards per rush, which ranks second-worst, and has allowed the most 30-yard rushing touchdowns in a season in NFL history with eight. This is a good matchup for Barkley and Jalen Hurts. 4. RB Tony Pollard, Tennessee Titans (+175)\nThe Titans are playing well these days. They've scored at least 24 points in the last three games, which includes a surprising shootout victory over the Cleveland Browns and a 26-9 beatdown of the Kansas City Chiefs last Sunday. Tony Pollard has been spectacular, having crossed 100 yards rushing in each of the last three games. He rushed for a career-high 161 yards and two touchdowns against Cleveland three games ago. Pollard didn't find the end zone last week, but I'm betting he does Sunday against the New Orleans Saints.\n5. WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Seattle Seahawks (-105)\nIf you bet on JSN to score a touchdown every week, you've won eight times and lost just seven. That's a pretty incredible run. Smith-Njigba leads the NFL in receiving yards (1,647), and has reached 90 yards receiving in 10 out of the last 11 games. Sunday marks a revenge game for Sam Darnold, who would surely like to blow out his former team in the Carolina Panthers. JSN will again be a major part of the game plan.\n            ",

His 216 yards were the fourth-most he's notched in a single game in his certain Hall of Fame career, and the first time the longtime Tennessee Titan put up 200 yards on a team other than the Houston Texans or Jacksonville Jaguars. And with Saturday night's effort, Henry's seventh 200-yard career game, he broke a three-way time with LaDainian Tomlinson and O.J. Simpson. That record came on Henry's last rushing attempt of the night, a 25-yard touchdown run that iced the game for Baltimore.But it wasn't Henry's only milestone of the night. Henry had already gone over 100 before halftime, passing former Dallas Cowboys great Tony Dorsett on the NFL's career rushing list to move into the top 10 with 12,892 yards. Henry, 31, has been steadily moving up the ranks on the all-time rushing list this season. Last month, Henry passed NFL legend Jim Brown against the Cincinnati Bengals on Thanksgiving. He had passed Hall of Famers Franco Harris, Marcus Allen, Edgerrin James and Marshall Faulk earlier in the season.Henry is even higher up on the career list when it comes to scoring the ball. With his four touchdowns Saturday night, he moved past Adrian Peterson and into fourth-place in NFL history. Henry had 118 entering the game, and his two scores before halftime tied him with Petersen's 120. He tacked on two more in the second half and is now one behind Allen's 123. Dorsett (164) and Tomlinson (145) are the top two in that category.\nPer CBS Sports research, here are some of his other accomplishments on the night:Second player in NFL history with multiple games with 200+ rush yds and 4+ rush TD (Jim Brown)Most rush yards by a visitor at Packers all-time (4th with 200+ yds along with Gale Sayers, Walter Payton and Peterson)Tied for most rushing attempts (36) in a game in Ravens history (Bam Morris and Priest Holmes)Third-most rush yds in a game in Ravens history behind Jamal Lewis (295) and Priest Holmes (227)Third-oldest player in NFL history with 200-yard rushing game (John Henry Johnson and James Brooks)Most rushing attempts (36) by any player in a game this seasonMost rush TD (4) in a game in team historyEarned 45.6 fantasy points (third-most by RB in a game this season)Henry had the most rushing attempts (15) by any player on his team's first two drives of the game since former Denver Broncos running back Olandis Gary did it in 1999. Henry now has 25 games with at least 100 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns, which is tied for the most in NFL history with Brown and Tomlinson.\nDuring his first season with the Ravens last year, Henry racked up 1,921 yards and 16 touchdowns, and he now has 1,469 yards and 16 touchdowns this season.NFL all-time rushing list PlayerRushing YardsEmmitt Smith18,355Walter Payton16,726Frank Gore16,000Barry Sanders15,269Adrian Peterson14,918Curtis Martin14,101LaDainian Tomlinson13,684Jerome Bettis13,662Eric Dickerson13,259Derrick Henry12,892Tony Dorsett12,739Jim Brown12,312Marshall Faulk12,279Edgerrin James12,246Marcus Allen12,243Franco Harris12,120Thurman Thomas12,074Fred Taylor11,695Steven Jackson11,438John Riggins11,352\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

Richards has already been ruled out for Palace's match against Tottenham on Sunday by manager Oliver Glasner, who didn't give a timetable for Richards' return, but he did note that Richards could be back for their game on New Year's Day. How to watch Crystal Palace vs. Tottenham, oddsDate: Sunday, Dec. 28 | Time: 11:30 a.m.Location: Selhurst Park -- LondonTV: USA Odds: Crystal Palace +120; Draw +230; Tottenham +240But Richards is optimistic, saying that it \"won't be long\" until he's back in the fold for Palace.\"Thanks everybody for the messages, won't be long till I'm back,\" Richards wrote on Instagram.\nNot only is that something positive for Palace fans, but it's also important for Mauricio Pochettino and the United States men's national team. Tyler Adams will be out for 2-3 months after tearing his MCL for Bournemouth against Manchester United, and an injury to more key members of his first-choice XI would be a speed bump in preparation for the 2026 World Cup on home soil. Richards and the 38-year-old Tim Ream are the clear top defenders for the USMNT, and with their best performances for Pochettino coming in a back three, losing a starting defender would be a massive blow to depth. Richards has become a critical piece of the Palace defense and one of the first names on the teamsheet as he grows as a defender under Glasner. \nTaking part in the Europa Conference League, Palace have quite a run of matches in their future, and they'll also want their backline to be in top shape when those are coming over the horizon. After facing Tottenham on Sunday, Palace will play four games in 10 days from Jan. 1-10 before getting back to a standard schedule.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        There were plenty of reasons why the Los Angeles Chargers lost to the Houston Texans on Saturday, but the most shocking one was the fact that Cameron Dicker had the first meltdown of his career.The Chargers kicker cost his team four points with a missed 32-yard field goal and a missed extra point in the 20-16 loss. Dicker missing two short kicks in one game might have been the most statistically improbable kicking meltdown the NFL has ever seen. Going into Week 17, Dicker had made 94.1% of his field goal attempts, which makes him the most accurate kicker in NFL history (No other kicker is even at 90%). Dicker had never missed two kicks in one game in his entire career, but that changed against Houston. The first miss came with just under 20 seconds left to play in the first half. After Elijah Molden came up with a huge interception, that set the Chargers up with the ball in Houston territory. The Chargers drive eventually came to an end at Houston's 14-yard line and that's when Dicker was sent out for a 32-yard field goal, a kick that's usually automatic for him. And when we say automatic, we mean automatic: Going into Saturday's game, Dicker had NEVER missed a field goal from inside 40 yards in his career (He was 68 of 68). But then that streak came to a sudden end. \nThe kick would have cut Houston's lead to 14-6, but with the miss, the Texans went into halftime with a 14-3 lead.  \nThe only thing more stunning then Dicker's field goal miss was his missed extra point, which came with just over three minutes left to play in the fourth quarter. After a 5-yard touchdown run by Omarion Hampton cut the lead to 20-16, Dicker had a chance to trim the lead to just three points, but instead, he shanked the extra point.\nGoing into that kick, Dicker had made 57 straight extra points in the regular season. It's impossible to say how the game would have played out if Dicker made both of those kicker, but it's very possible that the Chargers would have taken the Texans to overtime. \nLet's to a quick recap of Dicker's stunning meltdown: He missed two kicks in a game for the FIRST time in his careerHe missed a field goal from inside 40 yards for the first time in his careerHe only had two misses all season on 71 kicks (Field goals and extra points) going into Week 17His streak of 57 straight successful extra points came to an endAnd all of this happened to a kicker who was just voted to the Pro Bowl last week as the AFC's kicker. Dicker had only missed a total of two kicks ALL season, which is why he got the Pro Bowl nod. Going into Week 17, he was 36 of 38 on field goals this year, including 19 of 19 from inside 40, and he was 33 of 33 on extra points. The only good news for the Chargers is that they've already clinched a playoff spot, so Dicker will likely get a chance to redeem himself in the postseason. With the Chargers' loss, the Broncos clinched the AFC West, which means L.A. could be in spot to rest its starters in Week 18 against Denver. \n            ",

The going won't get any easier in Week 17, as Jackson is officially inactive for Baltimore against the Green Bay Packers on Saturday night.Jackson did not practice on Wednesday or Thursday and then was listed as doubtful on Friday. With Jackson sidelined, Tyler Huntley will get the start as the Ravens must win out and the Pittsburgh Steelers must lose out in order for Baltimore to make the playoffs.The Ravens reached the postseason the last three seasons but haven't looked like the offensive juggernaut the NFL world has come to know this year. Jackson has accounted for just nine total touchdowns and seven turnovers while averaging 21.8 rushing yards per contest over the past eight games while dealing with an array of injuries. This season marks the first time Jackson has lost six games as a starter -- and Sunday marked his first career loss in Week 15 or later. Previously, Jackson was 16-0.Jackson, the two-time MVP, was injured in the second quarter against the Patriots on a designed run when he took a knee to the back from safety Craig Woodson. \nJackson, who struggled to walk out of the locker room after the game, admitted his frustrations about being unable to re-enter the game. \"It's BS, bro,\" Jackson said. \"I can't control that. I'm on the ground. I'm down. I gave myself up. I got kneed in the back. ... [I'm] getting injured, and then we're fighting for a chance to make the playoffs. I can't finish the game with my guys. It's BS.\"Jackson said that he felt like the game was in the Ravens' favor when he got hurt. Jackson had completed 7 of 10 passes for 101 yards before exiting. He was injured right before the Ravens tied the game 10-10 with a field goal with 1:03 remaining in the first half. Huntley replaced Jackson under center and completed 9 of 10 passes for 65 yards. Baltimore had a 24-13 lead early in the fourth quarter before the Patriots stormed back to win with two touchdowns in the final nine minutes.\n\"My legs felt great. I just got kneed in the back in the red zone. I just couldn't finish the game. I was trying. I [got] a Toradol shot and stuff like that, but it still didn't get [any] better,\" Jackson said. \"Pain. It hurts. [It] hurts.\"\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Michigan State coach Tom Izzo expressed more concern about college basketball's future following Baylor landing former 2023 NBA Draft pick James Nnaji. It represents an unprecedented move after his multiple professional years in Europe. Nnaji, who never signed an NBA contract, most recently played with Yukatel Merkezefendi in Turkey on loan from Spain's FC Barcelona. He averaged 7.5 and 4.0 rebounds with Yukatel Merkezefendi. Nnaji and Barcelona mutually agreed to part ways after the 2024-25 season before he played with the Knicks in the 2025 Summer League.Now, Baylor and coach Scott Drew get an immediately eligible 21-year-old 7-footer to help fill the frontcourt void left by injuries to Juslin Bodo Bodo (arm) and Maikcol Perez (ACL).\"Now we're taking guys that were drafted in the NBA and everything?,\" Izzo said. \"I said it to you a month and a half ago – c'mon Magic (Johnson) and Gary (Harris), let's go baby, let's do it. Why not? I mean, if that's what we're going to, shame on the NCAA. Shame on the coaches, too. But shame on the NCAA, because coaches are gonna do what they gotta do, I guess. But the NCAA is the one. Those people on those committees that are making those decisions to allow something so ridiculous and not think of the kid.\"So everybody talks about me thinking of my program or I'm selfish. No. Get that straight, for all of you. I'm thinking of, what is best for my son if he was in that position? And I just don't agree with it.\"\nIzzo said he would like to \"poll 360 coaches\" and see how many agreed with this ruling in favor of Baylor. Izzo previously ripped transfer portal culture in August.\"Write this one down: It's gonna get me,\" Izzo said. \"I'm just not gonna let it bother me. But it's gonna get me sooner or later. Sooner or later, it's gonna get me. Not that I'm too stubborn not to ever do anything.\"Izzo later directed his criticism toward NCAA president Charlie Baker, though he didn't mention him by name.\n\"What we've done in the NCAA has been an absolute travesty to me,\" Izzo said. \"We're just worried about getting sued and we're not gonna fight anybody. And I think leadership means you fight and you make decisions that are sometimes unpopular.\"\n            ",

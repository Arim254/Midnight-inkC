It's been a rousing success thus far. After routing host nation Italy in the quarterfinals, 6-0, the Americans are set for a semifinal matchup against Sweden on Monday.To this point in the tournament, the U.S. has hardly broken a sweat. The Americans have outscored their five opponents 26-1, and their shutout streak has now hit four games. Team USA has been a force without equal -- at least through the quarterfinals -- so Sweden will try to push the Americans for the first time in Milan.That may prove difficult because the U.S. is loaded with stars up and down the lineup. The brightest of those stars has been defender Caroline Harvey, who has made her case as the best women's hockey player in the world. Harvey is up to nine points, which leads all players and is a record for a U.S. women's defenseman at the Olympics.Alex Carpenter has registered six points, Laila Edwards has shown off her rocket of a shot on multiple occasions, Abbey Murphy is a speed demon and the goaltending duo of Aerin Frankel and Gwyneth Philips has been literally almost perfect.U.S. captain Hilary Knight is still on the cusp of a couple records. Knight is currently tied for the most career Olympic goals and points for a U.S. women's player, so one goal against Sweden would break both.Below is everything you need to know about how to watch Team USA's semifinal clash with Sweden, as well as how they got here.\nU.S. women's hockey Olympic scheduleAll times EasternPreliminary roundThursday, Feb. 5: USA 5, Czechia 1 Saturday, Feb. 7: USA 5, Finland 0Monday, Feb. 9: USA 5, Switzerland 0Tuesday, Feb. 10: USA 5, Canada 0QuarterfinalFriday, Feb. 13: USA 6, Italy 0SemifinalUSA vs. Sweden | Monday, Feb. 16 | 10:40 a.m. | NBCBronze medal game\nTBD vs. TBD | Thursday, Feb. 19 | 8:40 a.m. | TBDGold medal gameTBD vs. TBD | Thursday, Feb. 19 | 1:10 p.m. | TBD\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        No. 3 South Carolina picked up a 79-72 win at No. 6 LSU on Saturday night, marking the Gamecocks' 18th straight victory against the Tigers. It was also coach Dawn Staley's 500th win with the program. The win keeps South Carolina (25-2, 11-1 SEC) alone in first place in the conference, while the loss likely ends any chance LSU (22-4, 8-4 SEC) had at earning at No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament.\"I think this team sees the end of the tunnel, meaning they know we are at the end of the season,\" Staley said during a postgame press conference. \"So it's a little bit easier to just focus in on what we have in front of us, and this was a big one. This was a huge game in front of us, huge game on the road and a hostile environment. Very NCAA Tournament-like. We just found a way to win.\"\nThe last name Johnson stole the spotlight last night as Tessa Johnson scored 21 points and Raven Johnson contributed with 19 in the Gamecocks' victory. Meanwhile, Flau'jae Johnson led LSU's effort with 21 points.As expected, this was a very competitive battle with no double-digit leads for either team at any point in the game. LSU won the first quarter 21-16 but South Carolina entered halftime with a 41-40 advantage. The Tigers played from behind the entire second half, but they got within one point multiple times during the fourth quarter.\nLSU had a chance to tie late in the game with two free throws from Flau'jae, but Staley said her team got \"lucky\" after she missed them both and then the Gamecocks got another opportunity to score. The coach also pointed out how unexpected it was to get the win despite giving up 18 offensive rebounds. \"It was two of the best teams in our conference, in the country, just trying to get a win,\" she said. \"We all said the game is going to be determined in those plays.\"Meanwhile, Kim Mulkey hopes her team takes this loss seriously, but she also likes what she is seeing from a roster that features eight new players and has only lost four games this season.\n\"My assessment would be keep doing what you are doing,\" Mulkey said. \"You are this close to winning some of those games against people you are not supposed to beat. And we did this year, didn't we beat Texas here? We weren't supposed to win that game, so just keep plugging away. Stay in the right mindset and understand it's a lot of basketball left to be played after the regular season is over.\"\n        \n            \n                Women's Bracketology: ACC teams on the bubble, plus mind-boggling stats for each No. 1 seed\n                \n                    Connor Groel                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHere is a closer look at Saturday's game:Fulwiley faces former teamThis was MiLaysia Fulwiley's first game against South Carolina since transferring to LSU. She had some good moments, including a steal, followed by a no-look pass to Grace Knox in the third quarter.However, it was not an ideal night for her overall. She finished the game going just 1 of 8 from the field with three turnovers in 24 minutes. Her energetic style of play can lift up her team, but sometimes it can also hurt her.\n\"We gotta continue to make the positive be pluses when she's in the ballgame and not minuses because she has tremendous quickness,\" Mulkey said. \"She has things that she just does naturally.\"\n'Who can guard Tessa?'That was the question Mulkey asked her team during a huddle in the middle of the third quarter. It was a valid one because Tessa Johnson went on to register a season-high 21 points, with 16 of those coming in the first half.She was on fire, but LSU freshman Bella Hines deserves credit for how she stepped up to guard her after Mulkey challenged someone to rise to the occasion.\nHines didn't just make an impact on defense, she was also bringing the energy on offense, including four quick points in the third quarter. In the six minutes she played, Hines scored six points and potentially earned herself more playing time.\"I saw a kid that I need to play more,\" Mulkey said. \"She needs to take away some of the minutes of some of them, because she got out there and guarded Tessa. She wasn't afraid to bow up to her. She made shots. She had a lot of energy and effort, and she has my respect.\"\nMadina Okot shines in return to starting lineupStaley took Okot out of the starting lineup before the game against Vanderbilt to take pressure off her. The center returned to the starting five on Saturday and put on one of her best performances of the season with 12 points and 17 rebounds.\nHer impact was especially felt late in the game when LSU was only down by one point and still had a chance to win. After Flau'jae Johnson missed two key free throws, Okot grabbed the defensive rebound and South Carolina called a timeout. With 25 seconds left, Okot snuck behind the LSU defense and converted a pass from Raven Johnson. She also knocked down two late free throws. \"Made probably made the biggest play of the game when Raven gave her a lob in the dunker and she made it. Took her time and made it,\" Staley said during the postgame broadcast interview. \"Truly proud of her because she's been just through somethings this season and hopefully she can gain some confidence from this win.\"\nFlau'jae is not wasting a failureFlau'jae Johnson, who finished the night with a team-high 21 points as well as eight rebounds, was doing everything she could for her team but some shots just didn't go in. She made it a one-point game with a second-chance jumper with 1:16 left in the fourth quarter. The crowd was electric and got even louder when she drew a foul with 45 seconds left. Unfortunately for her team, neither of her two attempts went in. She also missed a 3-pointer with 20 seconds remaining.. \nFlau'jae was emotional after the game thinking about those two free throws and what else she could have done defensively. However, she quoted former Alabama football coach Nick Saban when asked about how she would help the younger players move on from this result and stay locked in for the next game.\"Nick Saban says, 'Never waste a failure,' so we are not going to waste this loss,\" she said. \"We are definitely going to learn from it. We're going to grow from it. As vets, tomorrow or whenever we get back in the lab, we gotta focus. We really gotta be intentional about these last couple of games that we have and then going into the SEC Tournament and the Big Dance.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Inter are still the best team in the Italian Serie A and also showed it on Saturday when the team coached by Cristian Chivu won 3-2 at San Siro against Juventus. Despite a controversial decision from the referee at the end of the first half, when Juventus defender Pierre Kalulu was sent off after receiving a second yellow card for a foul on Alessandro Bastoni, Inter finally managed to win against one of the top Serie A teams. The Nerazzurri have so far struggled to rise to the occasion against Europe's elite, both domestically and on the international stage. In Serie A, they suffered defeats to AC Milan and Napoli, while in the UEFA Champions League league phase, they were beaten by Liverpool, Atletico Madrid and Arsenal. As a result of those setbacks, Inter are now forced into the playoff round, where they will face Bodo/Glimt on Wednesday (3 p.m. ET on Paramount+) for the first leg, looking to advance to the round of 16.Inter played two Champions League finals in the last three years and even if their primary target is to win the Scudetto again, they can potentially have success in their European campaign thanks to their recent form, winners of six in a row.Here's what to know about the win over Juve and what's to come:\nA controversial decision The controversial decision took place at the end of the first half in Milan when the referee Federico La Penna decided to send off Kalulu for a second yellow card for a foul on Bastoni. However, after reviewing the footage, it became clear that the contact on the Inter defender's shoulder was far less significant than it initially appeared. Despite that, VAR was unable to intervene. Under the current regulations in place until the end of the season, the video review can only overturn on-field decisions in cases involving red cards. Juventus were forced to play the remaining part of the game with 10 men, leading to their defeat at San Siro.\nThe post-match became heated as Juventus directors Giorgio Chiellini and Damien Comolli tried to confront the referee at the end of the first half in the tunnel alongside Juventus manager Luciano Spalletti. The Italian coach didn't speak after the match but left the floor to Chiellini, who seemed particularly frustrated.\"After what happened today, it's difficult to talk about football. Once again, something unacceptable occurred; you can't ruin a match of this level. This is a spectacle we present to the world; things need to change immediately, without the usual procrastination that often happens in Italian football. Since the beginning of the year, we have pointed out that there isn't a structure suitable for a league of this standard. We can't keep going like this. Decisions like the one made tonight simply cannot be taken so lightly.\"\nThe Italian chief of referees Gianluca Rocchi spoke on the matter to ANSA and said, \"La Penna is devastated and we stand by him, but I have to tell you the truth: he isn't the only one who made a mistake. Because yesterday there was a clear dive. The latest in a long series, in a league where they try in every possible way to deceive us.\"\nInter's depth will be key to UCL runDespite the episode mentioned above, Inter showed their full potential on Saturday, also thanks to the decisions made by Chivu in the second half. Unlike the past years when the second lines were not performing as the starting players, this season things are going much better. Francesco Pio Esposito, one of the most interesting Italian talents, scored a key goal against Juventus in the second half, while Piotr Zielinski scored the last-minute winning goal. Last season, the Polish midfielder didn't play regularly under Simone Inzaghi's management, but this season, also thanks to the recurring injuries of Hakan Calhanoglu, he played much more and has already scored six goals in all competitions, three in the last four Serie A games. While the second lines are more involved in the rotations and are performing better, Inter struggled more when they faced the top teams, and this is why the win against Juventus can become a turning point of the season ahead of the crucial last stretch. Inter faced a major setback in the closing months of last season, finishing without a single trophy and suffering a heavy 5–0 defeat to PSG in the Champions League final in Munich. It was a bitter ending that left a mark on the squad and its ambitions ahead of the current season, which also led to the departure of Inzaghi and the appointment of Chivu. This season, however, the narrative could be very different. Lifting the Serie A trophy would not only make them forget last season's disappointment but also reaffirm Inter's status at the top of Italian soccer, while look to once again also conquer Europe.\n            ",

The league has tried to drum up some more interest from fans and players alike to create a more intriguing event. Last year, that plan fell flat with a mini tournament that featured three All-Star teams and one Rising Stars team. This year, the league is still holding the mini tournament but will move to a USA vs. World format. The league wants to highlight the growing international talent, so we'll see Nikola Jokić, Luka Dončić, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and more compete against LeBron James, Kevin Durant and other top American talent. The rosters have already been set, so let's dig into some more details about the new format.\nHow to watch 2026 NBA All-Star GameTime: 5 p.m. ET | Date: Sunday, Feb. 15Location: Intuit Dome -- Los AngelesTV channel: NBC | Live stream: PeacockNBA All-Star Game format, explainedThe 24 All-Stars will be divided into three teams of eight. There will be two U.S. teams (USA Stars and USA Stripes) and one World team. Detroit Pistons coach J.B. Bickerstaff will coach USA Stars, while San Antonio Spurs coach Mitch Johnson will lead USA Stripes. Toronto Raptors coach Darko Rajaković will coach Team World.There will be a round-robin tournament of four, 12-minute games. USA Stars and Team World will face off in Game 1. The winner of that game will play USA Stripes in Game 2. The losing team of Game 1 will then play USA Stripes in Game 3. Following the three games, the two teams with the best record will face off in Game 4 with the chance to be crowned champions of All-Star Weekend.If all three teams have a 1-1 record after the first three games, the point differential from the round-robin games will be used to determine the two teams that advance to the championship game.The All-Star Game has a $1.8 million prize pool. Each player on the championship-winning team gets $125,000. Players on the second-place team get $50,000, while players on the third-place team get $25,000.Here are the rosters for the three All-Star rosters:2026 NBA All-Star rostersUSA StarsUSA StripesTeam WorldScottie BarnesJaylen BrownGiannis AntetokounmpoDevin BookerJalen BrunsonDeni AvdijaCade CunninghamStephen Curry (injured)Luka DončićJalen DurenKevin DurantShai Gilgeous-Alexander (injured)Anthony EdwardsBrandon Ingram (injury replacement)Nikola JokićChet HolmgrenLeBron JamesJamal MurrayJalen JohnsonKawhi LeonardAlperen Sengun (injury replacement)Tyrese MaxeyDonovan MitchellPascal SiakamNorman PowellKarl-Anthony TownsVictor Wembanyama\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\nThe NBA keeps attempting to find a format for its All-Star Game that will be competitive and spark more interest. It's hoping it found one this time around.A United States vs. World format will be in effect this year when the 2026 NBA All-Star Game takes place Sunday, beginning at 5 p.m. ET at Intuit Arena in Inglewood, Cal. Two teams consisting of American stars and one of international players will compete in a round-robin tournament that features four 12-minute contests.The USA Stripes team will be led by LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Jaylen Brown, while the USA Stars squad features Anthony Edwards, Devin Booker and Tyrese Maxey. Giannis Antetokounmpo was named to the World roster but will not participate due to a calf strain. However, Nikola Jokic and Victor Wembanyama are among the players expected to play for the World team.Sunday's college basketball schedule consists of more than 30 games, including an Atlantic 10 Conference matchup between Davidson (15-9) and Dayton (15-9) at 4 p.m. ET at the University of Dayton Arena. The Wildcats have won three of their last four games, while the Flyers have lost five of six.Another intriguing contest is a MAAC showdown that has Siena (17-9) visiting McCann Arena in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. to take on Marist (16-9) at 2 p.m. ET. Both teams are looking to avoid a third consecutive loss, while the Red Foxes aim to avenge last month's 69-50 loss at Siena. Team World is a +155 favorite to win the NBA All-Star Game tournament in the latest consensus NBA odds. Marist is a 1.5-point favorite against Sienna and Dayton is a 4.5-point favorite against Davidson.Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Sunday, Feb. 15. All times EasternNBA best bets, where to watchWorld vs. USA StarsTime: 5 p.m. | Location: Inglewood, Cal. | TV: NBC | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine pick -- Expert: USA Stars +2.5 (-113, Mike Barner)SportsLine NBA expert Mike Barner has been red-hot as he is 40-17 (+2014) on his last 57 NBA picks.

The SportsLine Projection Model doesn't see this contest being a blowout, but it does have the Red Foxes covering the spread in 65% of its simulations. SportsLine expert Thomas Casale (30-19, +675 on his last 49 college basketball picks) also believes Marist will emerge victorious as it is the top defensive team in the MAAC.Davidson at DaytonTime: 4 p.m. | Location: Dayton, Ohio | TV: ESPN2 | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Over 139.5 (-110) | Expert: Davidson +4.5 (-110, Larry Hartstein)Both teams are averaging more than 74 points per game this season, with the Flyers at 76.1 and the Wildcats at 74.5.

    "body": "\n        Arizona remained a No. 1 seed in the CBS Sports Bracketology model following its second straight loss on Saturday, but it did fall in the overall hierarchy. The Wildcats (23-2, 10-2 Big 12) are now the third No. 1 seed behind Michigan and Duke after falling 78-75 in overtime against Texas Tech.From a metrics-based standpoint, the Blue Devils (23-2, 12-1) have the No. 2 overall spot behind Michigan solidly triangulated after beating Clemson 67-54. They are No. 2 in WAB, which is a key resume metric, and they are also No. 2 at KenPom, which is a predictive metric on NCAA team sheets.There was also activity on the 2-seed line following a busy day of action. Iowa State's 74-56 win over Kansas sent the Cyclones back up to No. 2 seed territory in CBS Sports Bracketology. The rise of Iowa State (22-3, 9-3 Big 12) temporarily dislodged Illinois, dropping the Illini to a No. 3 seed ahead of their game against Indiana on Sunday.The Cyclones get another huge home opportunity Monday night against Houston in a Big 12 showdown.

However, once all the day's results and metric changes were factored in, Texas Tech emerged as the final No. 3 seed. Given that the Red Raiders now have wins over three of the four teams currently projected as No. 1 seeds, it's no surprise to see them rewarded. Critically, Texas Tech rose four spots from No. 15 to No. 11 in WAB, which is a vital resume metric that recognized the Red Raiders for slaying a highly ranked opponent on the road. Additionally, the Red Raiders enjoyed a six-spot jump at KenPom, rising to No. 16 in that predictive metric.\nFlorida making a charge Florida picked up another gain in WAB, rising from 14th to 13th following its 92-83 win over Kentucky. The Gators are still a No. 3 seed for now, but they are knocking on the door of a No. 2 seed. Alone atop the SEC standings, Florida (19-6, 10-2) rates neck and neck with Houston in barttorvik.com's measurement of who the nation's most-efficient team has been over the past six weeks. While four early-season losses diminished Florida's standing in resume metrics, this team is acing the eye test and looking like a juggernaut in predictive analytics that appear on team sheets. As a result, their standing in the NCAA's early top 16 reveal next Saturday will make for an interesting case study.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 NBA All-Star Game has arrived. The game, featuring a brand-new USA vs. World format, is being held Sunday afternoon at the Clippers' Intuit Dome. The All-Star Game rosters were finalized earlier this week with all injury replacements being named and some of the teams shuffled around. The USA vs. World format features three teams in a round-robin tournament. Twenty-eight players in total were named All-Stars this season as Spurs guard De'Aaron Fox joined the ranks Thursday. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, GiannisThe format will consist of a mini-tournament, where each team plays each other once to determine who will face off in a title game. There will be a USA Stars team and a USA Stripes team to split up the American talent, while Team World will have all the international NBA talent.Some liberties were taken in dividing up the roster to even up the numbers. For instance, Karl-Anthony Towns, who was born in New Jersey but has played for the Dominican Republic national team, will be on Team World, although he also could've been placed on one of the two USA teams. The same goes for Norman Powell, who was slid over to Team World to replace the injured Giannis Antetokounmpo after first being placed on USA Stripes. Powell, born in San Diego, has played for the Jamaican national team. \nAs far as the schedule goes, USA Stars -- made up of the younger American All-Stars like Scottie Barnes, Cade Cunningham and Tyrese Maxey -- and Team World will face Team World in Game 1. The winner of that matchup will face USA Stripes -- made up of American vets like Kevin Durant, LeBron James and Kawhi Leonard -- in Game 2. The loser of Game 1 will then also play USA Stripes in Game 3. At the end of the first three games, the two teams with the best record will face off in Game 4 to determine the champions. If there is a three-way tie, point differential will be used to determine the two teams that will advance.Here are the rosters for all three teams:2026 NBA All-Star Game rostersUSA Stars USA StripesTeam WorldScottie BarnesJaylen BrownGiannis Antetokounmpo (injured)Devin BookerJalen BrunsonDeni AvdijaCade CunninghamStephen Curry (injured)Luka DončićJalen DurenKevin DurantShai Gilgeous-Alexander (injured)Anthony EdwardsBrandon Ingram (injury replacement)Nikola JokićChet HolmgrenLeBron JamesJamal MurrayJalen JohnsonKawhi LeonardAlperen Sengun (injury replacement)Tyrese MaxeyDonovan MitchellPascal SiakamDe'Aaron Fox (injury replacement)Karl-Anthony TownsVictor WembanyamaNorman PowellThe 2026 All-Star game tips off at 5 p.m. EST on NBC and Peacock.

    "body": "\n        The West Coast Conference's eventual bid tally for the NCAA Tournament remains a point of significant uncertainty in mid-February after Gonzaga edged Santa Clara 94-86 on Saturday night to take sole possession of first place in the conference standings.The loss knocked the Broncos into the First Four Out of the CBS Sports Bracketology model on Sunday. Meanwhile, Saint Mary's remains on the inside of the cut line as one of the Last Four In following its 72-61 win at Pacific. While Gonzaga is a lock to go dancing — the Bulldogs are currently the top team on the No. 4 seed line -- the uncertainty around Saint Mary's and Santa Clara means the WCC could wind up with as many as three bids or as few as one.A couple of dates to know that will help clarify the picture:Feb. 25: Saint Mary's vs. Santa ClaraFeb. 28: Saint Mary's vs. GonzagaIn an ideal, bid-maximization scenario for the WCC, Santa Clara would would beat Saint Mary's and then Saint Mary's would beat Gonzaga, resulting in both bubble teams earning Quad 1 victories. Of course, it will also be paramount that Santa Clara avoid slipping up in games against San Francisco (Feb. 21) and Oregon State (Feb. 28). Similarly, Saint Mary's can ill-afford losses to Seattle (Feb. 18) or Washington State (Feb. 21).The WCC Tournament is just around the corner, and top two seeds get automatic byes to the semifinals. That's another reason why the stretch run is so important for Saint Mary's and Santa Clara. They could simplify their paths to the NCAA Tournament by positioning themselves to need just two victories to secure an automatic bid.As for other bubble activity following Saturday, one of the big winners was San Diego State, which switched over from the First Four Out to the Last Four In following its 71-57 win over Nevada.

Losing here would be unadvisable in what's shaping up as a fringe Quad 1 or 2 game.\n            ",

This is the seventh time that the annual showcase has been in the City of Angels, but the first time that the Clippers will be the sole hosts.All of the action is taking place at the new Intuit Dome, which opened last season. The Clippers' arena, which cost $2 billion, has drawn rave reviews from fans and players alike, and will become the center of the basketball world for three days. Damian Lillard and Keshad Johnson were the big winners on All-Star Saturday. The Trail Blazers legend won his third career 3-point contest despite not playing this season as he recovers from a torn Achilles. Johnson, meanwhile, put his name on the radar by dunking and dancing his way to the Dunk Contest trophy.Bet NBA All-Star Weekend at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:Sunday evening brings the All-Star Game, and the format has been tweaked once again. This time, it's Team USA vs. Team USA vs. Team World. The All-Star selections have been separated into three teams and will compete in a round-robin tournament. The league hopes that pitting Americans against international players will generate a more competitive environment, but we'll have to wait to see if that makes a difference. \nHere's how to watch Sunday's NBA All-Star Game, which is tipping off in the middle of the afternoon in L.A.How to watch 2026 NBA All-Star GameTime: 5 p.m. ET | Date: Sunday, Feb. 15Location: Intuit Dome -- Los AngelesTV channel: NBC | Live stream: PeacockAhead of this weekend's festivities, CBS Sports' panel of experts made their picks for All-Star Game and All-Star Game MVP.

You'll remember him getting ticked off at Anthony Edwards in the skills competition when Ant decided to shoot left handed for the lols. \nHerbert: The theme here is that I think the guys I picked will take this stuff seriously. For the All-Star \"Game,\" I just picked the team that I thought would try the hardest. (I was tempted to take Team World, but, historically, Nikola Jokić and Luka Dončić have not expended much energy on this stage.) I can see Cunningham and Jalen Duren setting a competitive tone, especially with J.B. Bickerstaff coaching them. Maloney: I'm going with Team World to win the All-Star Game and Victor Wembanyama to take home MVP. Even with Giannis Antetokounmpo and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander sidelined due to injury, Team World is the most talented bunch, and Wembanyama has made it abundantly clear that he's taking this more seriously than everyone else. Salerno: If you watched the movie \"Hustle,\" you know Kermit Wilts, AKA Anthony Edwards, loves competition. In this kind of format/showcase, guards tend to dominate. I'm going with Edwards, -- and, by extension, the USA Stars team -- to have a night to remember in Southern California. The new format hopefully will inject new life into the ASG. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Michigan is No. 1 in Sunday morning's updated CBS Sports Top 25 And 1 daily college basketball rankings for the sixth consecutive day -- and, if you've been following along since early November, you likely know the Wolverines have also been No. 1 in the Top 25 And 1 for other parts of the season. But, for one reason or another, they've yet to move to No. 1 in the Associated Press Top 25 poll despite dominating the sport, their conference, and beating ranked competition in an unprecedented way.That should change Monday, though.Arizona's two losses over the past week, paired with Michigan winning at Northwestern 87-75 on Wednesday and then beating UCLA 86-56 on Saturday, should be enough to get Dusty May's team to the top spot. Truth be told, Michigan should be the unanimous No. 1.There's no sensible alternative option.The Wolverines are 24-1 overall, 14-1 in the Big Ten and on a 10-game winning streak featuring victories over Michigan State, Nebraska and Ohio State. They're 9-0 in Quadrant-1 and college basketball's only one-loss power-conference team. They own 40-point victories over Gonzaga and San Diego State, 30-point wins over Auburn and UCLA, and a 28-point win over Villanova. Beyond the Top 25 And 1, they're also No. 1 in the NET, at KenPom.com, BartTorvik.com, EvanMiya.com and basically every other dot-com I know.\nNo other team can match that resume.So, yeah, I think Michigan will get to No. 1 in the AP Poll on Monday. And then, just one day later, on Tuesday, we'll get No. 1 Michigan at Purdue in a matchup of Final Four contenders. If Purdue wins it, there's a scenario where the top six teams in the Big Ten could be within two games of each other in the loss column of the league standings on Wednesday morning. Fun race. It probably won't be decided until the final weekend of the regular season.As for movement in Sunday morning's Top 25 And 1, Arizona's 78-75 overtime loss to Texas Tech pushed the Wildcats down to No. 4 and elevated the Red Raiders up to No. 16. That development knocked St. John's down one spot to No. 17, no fault of its own. And Kansas getting blasted at Iowa State, 74-56, resulted in the Jayhawks dropping to No. 9, which allowed Purdue and Nebraska to move up to No. 7 and No. 8, respectively.\nThe team right behind that group, No. 10 Illinois, is the only ranked team in action Sunday. The Illini are hosting Indiana in a game scheduled to tip at 1 pm ET.

    "body": "\n        There are lots of ways to score points, but usually quarterback play, offensive line strength and dynamic playmakers are essential to building an explosive offense in college football. Indiana featured all three last year, riding the nation's No. 3 scoring offense all the way to a historic College Football Playoff National Championship. The weren't alone, though, with seven CFP teams ranking No. 32 or better in points per game in 2025. So while it's not a garuntee of success, fielding an offense that can score points at will provides a difiniitive advantage and a leg up in a landscape growing more competitive by the day. Coming out of the 2026 recruiting and transfer portal cycle, some teams appear better equipped than others to light up the scoreboard next season.Here's a projection of which college football teams could field the most explosive offenses in 2026:\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. TexasTexas added Auburn wide receiver Cam Coleman along with running backs Hollywood Smothers (NC State) and Raleek Brown (Arizona State) to help reshape the offense for 2026. The Longhorns won bidding battles for Coleman and Smothers, who combined for 12 touchdowns at their previous stops last season.Arch Manning is coming off the best outing of his career after outdueling Michigan's Bryce Underwood in the Citrus Bowl, a postseason showing that mirrored the second-half surge that accelerated his development. If Manning takes another step, this Texas offense could rival the best of the Sarkisian era on the Forty Acres -- a stretch that already includes consecutive CFP semifinal appearances.Like other elite programs that are a grenade-pin pull away from another level in 2026, everything starts up front for Texas. The Longhorns have reloaded with a bevy of highly rated portal additions who will flourish only if Manning has time to operate. If Texas controls the line of scrimmage, the pieces are in place for this SEC power to stress opposing defenses behind elite play-caller Steve Sarkisian and a rising star at quarterback.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. MiamiAssuming the Hurricanes overcome the loss of four impact starters along the offensive line, Miami should continue generating explosive plays and scoring at a rapid pace next fall. The arrival of Duke transfer quarterback Darian Mensah -- along with his top target Cooper Barkate and former South Carolina slot receiver Vandrevius Jacobs -- gives Shannon Dawson flexibility and eases the burden on Malachi Toney.Targeted heavily down the stretch of his freshman season, Toney set a single-season program record with 109 receptions.Veteran running backs Mark Fletcher Jr. and Jordan Lyle also return. Three of Fletcher's six 100-yard performances came over the final four games, when Lyle was limited by injury.\nProjecting ahead, Mario Cristobal's likely starting offensive line could include Matthew McCoy, Samson Okunlola, SJ Alofaituli, Jamal Meriweather and five-star freshman tackle Jackson Cantwell -- the No. 2 overall prospect in the 2026 class. If that group controls the line of scrimmage the way Miami did in 2025, the Hurricanes could be borderline unstoppable offensively.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. IndianaAfter leading the Big Ten in scoring offense each of the past two seasons, expectations may be bordering on unrealistic entering Curt Cignetti's third year. Fresh off a national championship, Indiana must replace a Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback, its top two running backs, leading receivers Elijah Sarratt and Omar Cooper Jr., and three offensive line starters.Few programs, however, are better positioned to absorb that level of change. Indiana's recent success has been driven by player development and precise scheme execution.\nCignetti has tabbed TCU transfer Josh Hoover as the replacement for Fernando Mendoza. Boston College transfer Turbo Richard adds explosiveness to the run game, while Michigan State's Nick Marsh and Tulane's Shazz Preston join Charlie Becker to reshape the receiving corps.The mentality up front is not expected to change. Whether the Hoosiers maintain their edge -- and the offensive efficiency that has defined this run -- will be determined quickly at the line of scrimmage.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Ohio StateRyan Day's decision to hire former NFL coach Arthur Smith as offensive coordinator has drawn mixed reviews, much of which is tied to Smith's results at the professional level. The college game presents a different equation, however, particularly when elite programs can overwhelm opponents with superior talent. That setting could allow Smith to thrive.\nAt Ohio State, Smith is expected to employ a streamlined, run-oriented approach while creating calculated downfield opportunities for Jeremiah Smith and others. Quarterback Julian Sayin ranked among the nation's most efficient passers as a redshirt freshman, and a significant leap is anticipated from the Heisman hopeful.Despite transfer portal losses at wide receiver, the Buckeyes remain loaded at the position, highlighted by the additions of five-star prospects Chris Henry Jr. and Jerquaden Guilford. Smith, Devin McCuin and Brandon Innis are projected starters, with Bo Jackson back at tailback.Solidifying the offensive line rotation looms as a key offseason priority. Day has emphasized the need to play at least eight linemen with positional versatility, underscoring the importance of depth and flexibility up front.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. OregonNo program in the country owns a better quarterback situation than the Ducks after Dante Moore's decision to skip the 2026 NFL Draft and return to school. Nebraska transfer Dylan Raiola is behind him, along with a couple of guys the coaching staff feels great about in Akili Smith Jr. and Brock Thomas. As freshmen last season, Jordon Davison and Dierre Hill Jr. showed out in the backfield and are anxious to take on featured roles. The biggest loss on offense is tight end Kenyon Sadiq -- a projected first-rounder. Jamari Johnson will get the first crack at matching his production at the position. Dakorien Moore, Jeremiah McClellan and Evan Stewart return as featured options at wideout. There might be slight statistical drop off with elite offensive coordinator Will Stein taking over at Kentucky, but Oregon has proved annually under Dan Lanning that this offense is a tough one to contain.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Notre DameThere will be no Jeremiyah Love or Jadarian Price to rescue the offense when needed next season, but Fighting Irish offensive coordinator Mike Denbrock has little reason to panic. After losing the first two starts of his career, C.J. Carr responded with 10 consecutive wins, finishing with 2,741 yards and 24 touchdowns. He was tied for No. 2 in the country in yards per attempt (9.4) and fifth in passer rating (168.06).\nAneyas Williams is expected to receive the first reps at running back, though Notre Dame could opt for a committee approach in 2026.Ohio State transfers Mylan Graham and Quincy Porter join a talented group of pass-catchers that includes Jaden Greathouse and Jordan Faison, who led the team in receptions and receiving yards as a junior.And if there is one position group Notre Dame rarely worries about, it is the offensive line. The Fighting Irish are consistently well-coached up front and typically set the tone in the trenches. With a favorable schedule ahead, this offense should post significant numbers throughout 2026.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. LSUWhen you assemble the nation's top-ranked transfer portal class and commit every available resource to making Year 1 under Lane Kiffin a success, the expectation is immediate production.In addition to landing former Arizona State quarterback Sam Leavitt, Kiffin added USC signal-caller Husan Longstreet and overhauled LSU's wide receiver room with 12 newcomers. The offensive line also projects as a major strength, anchored by five-star Colorado transfer Jordan Seaton. That unit must improve after uneven play last fall, when the Tigers struggled at times to protect Garrett Nussmeier and failed to meet lofty preseason expectations.Tight end Trey'Dez Green returns as a proven playmaker, and Harlem Berry -- the No. 1 running back in the 2025 recruiting cycle -- opted to remain with the program to see what Kiffin and his staff can build.\nKiffin engineered a rapid offensive turnaround at Ole Miss with tempo and efficiency. He will attempt to replicate that formula in Baton Rouge after bringing offensive coordinator Charlie Weis Jr. and several assistants with him.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    8. Texas TechTexas Tech's CFP shutout loss to Oregon left a bitter taste inside the program, a stark offensive failure that set the offseason narrative. Coach Joey McGuire quickly identified and addressed his offensive needs needs during this transfer portal cycle, adding Cincinnati quarterback Brendan Sorsby and four wide receivers, including two from Power Four programs. Another strong portal class positions Texas Tech to compete for a Big 12 championship and a playoff berth -- provided the offense performs at a high level, especially given personnel losses on defense. In 2025, the Red Raiders often leaned on their defense to make plays, a luxury they may not have next fall.Optimism rests partly on a talented backfield anchored by returning contributors Cameron Dickey, J'Koby Williams and Quinten Joyner, who will be counted on to lift the offense next season.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    9. Ole MissWith quarterback Trinidad Chambliss receiving an injunction to play a sixth season, the Rebels look like a juggernaut in 2026.. Auburn transfer Deuce Knight was once an insurance policy, set to take over under center if Chambliss' court challenge fell through. Now he'll be a luxury. Retaining college football's most potent running back also helps after Kewan Lacy stiff-armed pursuit by LSU and Kiffin to stay with the Rebels. He's a 1,400-yard rusher who scored an SEC-leading 23 touchdowns last fall.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    10. Oklahoma StateEric Morris fielded the nation's top total offense (512 yards per game) and scoring average (45.1 points) at North Texas last year. Transitioning from the Group of Six to the Power Four presents a new challenge, but Morris's system is proven -- and he persuaded his two best North Texas players to follow him.Oklahoma State could emerge as college football's most-improved team thanks to Morris and a top-10 transfer class, highlighted by quarterback Drew Mestemaker and tailback Caleb Hawkins. The Cowboys are poised for multiple high-scoring Big 12 shootouts, with plenty of fireworks and eye-popping numbers expected from their all-conference-caliber offensive talent.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        On a day synonymous with love, Providence and No. 17 St. John's spent part of their Valentine's Day exchanging punches in place of pleasantries. The two Big East rivals had an old-fashioned brouhaha in Rhode Island on Saturday that led to six ejections, numerous flagrant fouls and one ugly scene after Providence's Duncan Powell committed a hard foul on St. John's star (and former Friar) Bryce Hopkins, which required nearly a 20-minute intermission for the officiating crew to sort out. That's Valentine's Day done the Big East way. But a brutal brawl in the Big East was just one of many headlines across college hoops Saturday -- even if it reverberated the loudest of them all.  Elsewhere, Florida chomped down on the SEC lead with a 92-83 win over Kentucky, Purdue stayed hot with a road win at Iowa and Duke -- as it has done much of the season -- dominated another ACC foe to retain its grip on the lead league.There were plenty of highs and lows from the day, which was largely frontloaded, and there are plenty more to come. To digest it all our team has a recap of some of the day's biggest winners and losers below.\nWinner: Duke sends a message to retain lead in ACCWith No. 20 Clemson one game back in the ACC standings with a chance to take down top dog and fourth-ranked Duke inside Cameron Indoor, the Blue Devils sent a message with an emphatic 67-54 win, proving once again that they remain the class of the ACC. Duke led by double digits for nearly the entire second half and quieted any potential of a Clemson upset relatively early behind big days from Cameron Boozer (18 points, eight rebounds), Isaiah Evans (17 points) and Cayden Boozer (12 points). The win puts Duke two games clear of Clemson in the ACC standings and keeps it 1.5 games ahead of second-place Virginia. -- Kyle BooneLoser: St. John's, Providence don't feel the love on Valentine's DayProvidence and St. John's players certainly didn't get the memo that it was Valentine's Day. Six players were ejected after a massive brawl broke out in the battle of Big East foes. Providence's Duncan Powell committed a hard foul on St. John's forward Bryce Hopkins, who played at the school before transferring to the Red Storm this past offseason. Powell was assessed a Flagrant-2 foul and was ejected from the game. This game was delayed for nearly 20 minutes while the officials reviewed what just happened. It wouldn't be shocking if some subsequent suspensions were handed out after what transpired. -- Cameron Salerno\n        \n            \n                WATCH: Massive brawl breaks out between St. John's and Providence, six players ejected\n                \n                    Will Backus                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWinner: Texas Tech slays another dragonNo. 16 Texas Tech's resume now includes victories over three of the top-four teams in the AP Top 25 poll after the Red Raiders toppled No. 1 Arizona 78-75 in overtime on the road. The victory, which was keyed by a combined 50 points from JT Toppin and Christian Anderson, adds to a resume that also includes wins over No. 3 Houston and No. 4 Duke. \nArizona was playing shorthanded, as star freshman forward Koa Peat missed the second half due to a lower body injury. But the Wildcats (23-2, 10-2 Big 12) still had a golden opportunity to close this one out, leading 64-57 with just over three minutes left before wilting down the stretch for their second loss of the week. -- David Cobb\nWinner: Michigan makes a case to jump Arizona for No. 1For the last two months, Arizona has occupied the No. 1 spot in the AP Top 25 poll. After the Wildcats suffered their first two losses of the season this week, that spot will likely now belong to Michigan. The No. 2 Wolverines rested their case with a dominant 86-56 win over UCLA at home.

It was yet another game Peterson failed to finish, which has been a theme for the projected No. 1 pick for much of the season as he's either missed games or exited early in games he's played.\nKU coach Bill Self said postgame the decision to sit Peterson for the final 7:01 was his to make as he looked ahead to prep the No. 9 Jayhawks for Wednesday because ISU was so in control of the game. He also added that Peterson, who missed Monday's game vs. No. 1 Arizona because of an illness, did not get a full allotment of practices this week as he dealt with the lingering effects of it. -- Boone\n        \n            \n                Iowa State routs Kansas, snaps Jayhawks eight-game winning streak in Darryn Peterson's return after illness\n                \n                    Kyle Boone                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWinner: Hilton Magic shows off its powersFar too often this season, Iowa State has relied solely on Milan Momcilovic to be the best shooter in the country and Joshua Jefferson to do, well, everything. But in the 74-56 dismantling of No. 9 Kansas, it was Iowa State's supporting cast that had its best showing in awhile. Jamarion Bateman came off the bench and splashed three treys. Blake Buchanan (11 points, six rebounds) had his best game in a month. Momcilovic did his thin with 18 points and four triples, but 57 points from everyone not named Momcilovic or Jefferson is exactly what Iowa State needs to reach the peak of its powers. Oh, and a vicious defense doesn't hurt either. -- Isaac TrotterLoser: NC State chokes late vs. MiamiNC State led by as many as eight points in the second half -- and held a seven-point lead with 55 seconds remaining over Miami! -- before flailing to the finish in the biggest choke job of the afternoon. Miami scored eight unanswered points in the final 52 seconds, which culminated with three free throws from Miami guard Tru Washington after an ill-advised NC State foul on a 3-point attempt from Washington.\nWashington made all three attempts from the charity stripe, and NC State's attempt to win it with a buzzer-beater on the other end was no good in the 77-76 Miami victory.\"I don't see a whole lot of positives,\" NC State coach Will Wade said. \"Poor coaching. Poor coaching on my part that we couldn't bring that home. We looked like Keystone Cops there at the end of the game.\"It's the second consecutive loss for NC State after falling at Louisville on Monday by 41 points -- its largest loss since 2017. -- Boone\nWinner: BYU's Wright can do no wrong this weekFor the second time in as many games, BYU guard Rob Wright dropped a career-high in points in a game his team needed every bit of his production. Just four days removed from a career-high 30 points vs. his former team, Baylor, the first-year Cougars star scored 39 points and led BYU to a 90-86 overtime win over Colorado. He finished the game 12-of-16 shooting from the field, made all four of his 3-point attempts and was 11 of 13 from the free-throw line. He also added five boards and four steals.Wright's production was only second-most important to the timeliness of said production. Twenty-three of his 39 points came in the second half, and a combined 29 of his total 39 points came in both the second half and overtime. In overtime, he scored or assisted on 11 of his team's 12 points to eventually pull away. -- Boone\nLoser: Ohio State allergic to Quad 1 winsOhio State had a great opportunity to enter Sunday with two Quad 1 wins after beginning Saturday as one of the First Four Out in CBS Sports Bracketology. Now, it appears the Buckeyes could have zero Quad 1 wins come Sunday. \nAfter leading Virginia by six midway through the second half of a neutral-site showdown in Nashville, the Buckeyes wilted late in a 70-66 loss. Making matters worse, Northwestern lost 68-49 at Nebraska. The Wildcats were No. 74 in the NET, which put them one spot ahead of the top-75 cutoff for Ohio State's road win over Northwestern to be considered a Quad 1 win. After dropping their fifth straight game, the Wildcats may be in line for a NET drop. Which means the Buckeyes could be four weeks out from Selection Sunday with zero Quad 1 wins. -- Cobb\nWinner: TCU gets gritty OT win over Oklahoma StateTCU could have folded after giving up an uncontested layup to Parsa Fallah to force overtime with a tenth of a second left in regulation, but the Horned Frogs continued their standout play with a gut-check 95-92 overtime victory over Oklahoma State. It's the second key road win for TCU's ever-improving resume, and Jamie Dixon's bunch has now won three in a row. Six different Frogs cracked double figures, but Jayden Pierre (16 points, four assists) was the star of the game as he snuffed any Oklahoma State momentum with his fourth trey late in the game. David Punch (19 points) was also excellent after intermission. TCU has added +1.2 Wins Above Bubble to its ledger in the last five days after knocking off a top-10 Iowa State club and notching a road win -- which is vital for WAB -- over the Pokes. -- Trotter\nLoser: Fire delays Oklahoma vs. GeorgiaDuring the first half of Oklahoma's 94-78 victory vs. Georgia, the game was paused temporarily after a fire broke out on the concourse at Lloyd Noble Center. Fans near the fire were temporarily cleared out of their seats. The game resumed after a short pause in the action. It appeared that a popcorn machine was what caught on fire. -- Salerno\nWinner: Louisville's Brown goes off (again)Mikel Brown Jr.  followed up his 45-point Monday explosion against NC State with 29 points in No. 24's Louisville's 82-71 win over Baylor. The freshman flamethrower made 4 of 5 attempts from beyond the arc and also dished out six assists in another sterling performance that demonstrated the Cardinals' high-end potential. Louisville was just 4-4 when Brown missed over a month due to a back injury, but it is 6-1 since his return. Brown is one of the most exciting guards in college basketball, and his presence on the floor makes Louisville a lethal offensive team. -- Cobb\nLoser: Virginia Tech's resume takes a beatingVirginia Tech entered the day as one of the First Four Out of the NCAA Tournament field in CBS Sports Bracketology after its at-large hopes picked up significant steam Wednesday night in a win at Clemson. That upset victory was worth a meaty 0.78 points in WAB, which is an important metric the NCAA Tournament selection committee uses in evaluating a team's resume. But the Hokies turned around and gave it all back on Saturday -- and then some -- while getting run off their own floor late in a 92-69 loss to Florida State. \nThe Quad 3 defeat will be tough for the Hokies to overcome in their quest to reach the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2022. Big opportunities at Miami (Feb. 17), at North Carolina (Feb. 28) and at Virginia (March 7) still await, and now they loom even larger than before. After faltering at home to lower-tier ACC foe, the Hokies will likely need to win a couple of those. -- CobbWinner: Purdue scores another important road winThe Big Ten looks like it's Michigan to lose until further notice, but No. 13 Purdue took another important step toward remaining in contention with a 78-57 road win at Iowa. It's the second consecutive road win over an NCAA Tournament quality team this week after downing Nebraska in overtime on Tuesday, and one that gets it to 11-3 in conference play with Michigan coming to West Lafayette on Tuesday night. -- BooneWinner: Florida builds SEC separationFlorida won the national championship last season, but it didn't win the SEC regular season title. After a 92-83 win over No. 25 Kentucky on Saturday, the No. 14 Gators are well on their way to changing that in 2026. Since starting league play with a loss at Missouri, Florida (19-6, 10-2 SEC) is 10-1 and operating as efficiently as any team in college basketball. A few close early-season losses may have diminished Florida's national profile, but this team is finding its stride, looking like the clear cut best team in the SEC and a legitimate national title contender.  -- Cobb\nLoser: Texas A&M's slide toward bubble continuesLong losing streaks for otherwise good basketball teams are a Texas A&M staple now transcending multiple eras of Aggies hoops. Saturday's 82-69 loss at No. 19 Vanderbilt was the fourth straight for A&M (17-8, 7-5 SEC), which is slipping rapidly toward the NCAA Tournament bubble after it was first in the SEC standings earlier this month. First-year coach Bucky McMillan is new in town, but A&M fans are used to this. Under Buzz Williams last season, A&M dropped four straight late in conference play but was still a No. 4 seed in the Big Dance. In 2024, it dropped five straight in February and still ended up as a No. 9 seed. The Aggies lost eight straight in league play during 2022 and nearly reached the NCAA Tournament anyway. The trend even dates back to Billy Kennedy's tenure, when the Aggies started 0-5 in the SEC in 2018  and still managed to reach the Sweet 16. -- Cobb\nWinner: Navy (!) continues its breakout seasonNavy has not made the NCAA Tournament since 1998, but the Midshipmen added another chapter to a breakthrough season under first-year head coach Jon Perry. Navy waltzed into Colgate, usually the Patriot League titan, and emerged with an 84-80 road victory to improve to 21-6 and 13-1 in conference play. Jordan Pennick splashed six treys and finished with 22 points. Donovan Draper came off the bench and added 20 points, eight rebounds, three steals and three assists. These Midshipmen can hoop. -- TrotterLoser: Georgia's tourney outlook dims with ugly OU lossMike White's Georgia Bulldogs entered Saturday as one of the Last Four In the 68-team NCAA Tournament field as projected by CBS Sports Bracketology -- and then laid a giant egg on the road in a tough-to-swallow loss to an OU team that was tied for last place in the SEC entering the day. UGA's 94-78 loss to the Sooners will almost certainly dim its immediate tourney outlook, but worst of all, it's a loss that will potentially fester and stick as a Quad 2 loss given OU's downward trajectory. Few games in SEC play qualify as can't-lose games, but falling to this Sooners team at this time and by 16 points -- while dropping the fifth game in its last six outings -- is a tough one to stomach. Georgia shouldn't feel good at all about where things are right now with respect to their March Madness hopes. There is work to do to bolster its lacking resume, and the schedule only gets more stiff from here. -- BooneLoser: Auburn's losing streak growsAuburn has now dropped four straight after falling 88-75 at No. 21 Arkansas. The Tigers (14-11, 5-7 SEC) were playing without leading scorer Keyshawn Hall, who is out indefinitely for disciplinary reasons. First-year coach Steven Pearl said the duration of Hall's suspension will be \"up to him.\" Auburn entered the day as a No. 8 seed in CBS Sports Bracketology, but it needs to start winning again. Playing without Hall is less than ideal considering he entered Saturday fourth in the SEC in scoring at 20.7 points per game.\"We're hoping this isn't something that has to drag out longer than it needs to,\" Pearl said. -- CobbWinner: Texas can exhaleAt a time when a chunk of its SEC peers are sliding toward the bubble, Texas is trying to do the opposite after beginning the day as a No. 10 seed. The Longhorns throttled Missouri 85-68 on the road for their fourth straight victory and fifth Quad 1 win. Texas (16-9, 7-5 SEC) cannot rest on its laurels, but it can take a breath in acknowledgement of the fact that its hopes of dancing are in a good spot. First-year coach Sean Miller has this team operating at its highest levels of the season. Missouri's breathing room might be gone. After entering the day as one of the Last Four in the CBS Sports Bracketology field of 68, the Tigers are living life on the edge. -- Cobb\n            ",

He took over for Kevin Willard four seasons ago and won 17 games in his first year, 25 games in his second year and then seven games in his third year. Now Seton Hall is 17-7 with a 7-7 record and is looking like a fringy NCAA Tournament bubble team. However, the Pirates are only 7-9 against the spread as favorites this season and Butler is 8-6 against the spread at home. The model predicts that the Bulldogs win outright and cover in 72% of simulations. Back Butler to cover at DraftKings here:Belmont money line vs. Murray State (-102)Casey Alexander has managed at least 20 wins in each of his seven seasons as the head coach at Belmont, but he's still chasing his first NCAA Tournament appearance with the Bruins. Belmont is 23-4 overall this season and can give itself a three-game lead in the Missouri Valley Conference with a win over second-place Murray State (19-8, 11-5) on Sunday night. The model predicts that Belmont wins outright in 58% of simulations. Back Belmont at DraftKings here:Team World to win 2026 NBA All-Star Game tournament (+155)\"The new NBA All-Star format, with three teams competing in a round-robin tournament, should create more fan interest and more on-court intensity.

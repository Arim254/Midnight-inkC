    "body": "\n        How exactly has Christian Pulisic become the best player in Serie A? The American star has been one of the most consistent strikers around Europe this year, even if AC Milan faced a disappointing end of the 2024-25 season, as the Rossoneri ended up without playing any European tournament this season. Pulisic is by far the most important player of the team now coached by Massimiliano Allegri and he's showing it every week. Despite some injuries continuing to create issues for the USMNT captain, even in this first part of the season, Pulisic makes the difference constantly and has already scored nine goals and provided two assists in the 13 games he played so far in all competitions during the 2025-26 season. In 2025, the American captain also lifted his first trophy at the club by winning the Supercoppa Italiana that they will aim to defend this weekend in Saudi Arabia. How did it happen?How to watch Napoli vs. AC Milan Date: Thursday, Dec. 18 | Time: 2 p.m. ETLocation: King Saud University Stadium -- Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Live stream: Paramount+Odds: Napoli +180; Draw +200; AC Milan +170A key tactical changeDespite the managerial change, Pulisic was able to keep his identity and importance in the roster, and also after one substantial role change under Allegri's management. In fact, the Italian coach decided to change the role of the American international as he regularly played this season as a striker in the 3-5-2, deployed by the former Juventus coach, who this season made his comeback at the club where he won the 2011 Serie A title. \n\n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            Interestingly enough, Pulisic now has more freedom to move around the attack, and he's not forced to have crucial defensive tasks like before. When he joined AC Milan from Chelsea in the summer 2023 under manager Stefano Pioli, the main idea was to make him the natural replacement of Rafael Leao on the left wing of the attack, but considering his early performances, he quickly became a starter on the other side of the attack, as right winger who occasionally played as attacking midfielder, and then also on the left when Leao was not available. In his first season at AC Milan, he scored a total of 15 goals in all competitions in 50 matches played, becoming the second U.S. international with 10 league goals in a season in the top four European leagues after Clint Dempsey did it twice, first in the 2011-12 season (17 goals) and second in the 2010-11 season (12 goals).His second season had some ups and downs and two different managers as Paulo Fonseca was replaced by Sergio Conceicao ahead of the 2024 Supercoppa Italian final four, the first and only trophy won by Pulisic at AC Milan so far. Despite a disappointing club season as they ended up out of the European tournaments, he scored 17 goals in 50 matches and also provided 12 assists, confirming again his role as club leader with similar tactical duties compared to the season before. \nThe numbers of his third season in Italy are in the same direction so far, but it's the tactical change that makes it much different. Pulisic has more freedom, and he's free to play on the left side of the pitch, where he feels more comfortable. The ongoing injuries to both Leao and Santiago Gimenez have prevented the American star from consistently playing alongside the same striker, something that must be taken into account. That said, if there is one player AC Milan simply cannot do without, it's Pulisic. As 2026 approaches, it brings with it the World Cup on home soil, where Pulisic will lead his national team in what is likely to be the most important year of his career so far. He looks more than ready.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Chicago Bears have expanded their search for a new stadium site beyond the state of Illinois. In a letter sent to fans Wednesday, Bears president Kevin Warren said Northwest Indiana is among the locations the franchise will explore to build a new domed stadium.The franchise has spent several years searching for a location for a new home after more than 50 years playing at Chicago's Soldier Field. Initially, the Bears had hoped to build the stadium in the northwestern Chicago suburb of Arlington Heights. The franchise purchased the site in 2023, but Warren said in his letter that Illinois state leaders have told him the project is not a priority for 2026. The Bears did not ask for taxpayer dollars to build the stadium, but wanted an infrastructure commitment for roads and utilities. \n        \n            \n                Prisco's Week 16 NFL picks: Seahawks top Rams on 'TNF,' Packers edge Bears, Jaguars upset Broncos\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"Stable  timelines are critical, as are predictable processes and elected   leaders, who share a sense of urgency and appreciation for public   partnership that projects with this level of impact require,\" Warren wrote. \"We have not   received that sense of urgency or appreciation to date. We have been   told directly by State leadership, our project will not be a priority in   2026, despite the benefits it will bring to Illinois.\"Warren's solution: a potential move to Northwest Indiana. The Indiana border is approximately 15 miles from Soldier Field, but having the team not only play outside the city of Chicago, but outside the state of Illinois altogether would be a controversial move.\n\"Consequently,  in addition to Arlington Park, we need to expand our  search and  critically evaluate opportunities throughout the wider  Chicagoland  region, including Northwest Indiana,\" the letter continued. \"This is not about  leverage. We  spent years trying to build a new home in Cook County. We  invested  significant time and resources evaluating multiple sites and  rationally  decided on Arlington Heights. Our fans deserve a world-class  stadium.  Our players and coaches deserve a venue that matches the  championship  standard they strive for every day. With that in mind, our  organization  must keep every credible pathway open to deliver that  future.\"Warren had hoped to finalize the Arlington Heights stadium's construction plans in September, so they could bid for a Super Bowl by 2031. \nThe Bears, whose lease at Soldier Field runs through 2033, are in the midst of their best season since going 12-4 in 2018. At 10-4, the Bears are in first place in the NFC North and have a chance to gain some separation in a massive divisional showdown with the Green Bay Packers (9-4-1) at Soldier Field on Saturday night. \n            ",

CBS Sports draft analyst Blake Brockermeyer mocked Lemon at No. 13 to the Carolina Panthers earlier this week.\"Lemon plays with a defensive mentality at the catch point and brings a competitive edge,\" Brockermeyer wrote. \"He's a problem in the slot due to his ability to create separation and make plays after the catch.\"\nAnother analyst, Josh Edwards, mocked Lemon at No. 20 to the Pittsburgh Steelers.\"D.K. Metcalf is locked in with Pittsburgh long-term, but the team has been searching for a complimentary skillset,\" Edwards wrote. \"Makai Lemon is that predominant slot player, who can make plays in space and create yards after the catch.\"Impact on USCLemon's announcement shouldn't come as a shock to Lincoln Riley's team. Lemon is expected to compete with Arizona State's Jordyn Tyson and Ohio State's Carnell Tate for WR1 in this class after having a standout junior season. Lemon isn't the only star wide receiver from USC declaring for the NFL Draft, as Ja'Kobi Lane already announced his intention to enter the draft.\nWhile USC will have to replace its top three pass catchers from this season (Lemon, Lane and tight end Lake McRee), star quarterback Jayden Maiava is returning to school for the 2026 season. At receiver, Tanook Hines is a name to keep an eye on for an expanded role next season. He enters the bowl 28 catches for 398 yards and two touchdowns. USC, which finished with the No. 1-ranked recruiting class in the 247Sports rankings for the class of 2026, should enter next season -- Year 5 for Riley -- with major expectations.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 Supercoppa Italiana is taking place this week in Saudi Arabia as the four best teams of the 2024-25 season will meet in a final four format starting from Thursday while the final will take place on Monday. Napoli vs. AC Milan will open the semifinal action, while Inter vs. Bologna will follow on Friday, as the 16th matchday of the Serie A season will feature only six fixtures this weekend. Here's all you need to know about the 2025 edition of the Supercoppa Italiana: Which teams are involved? There are four teams involved in the final four of the Supercoppa, a format that started off in 2023 when it was introduced for the first time in Italy and hosted by Saudi Arabia:Napoli: 2024-25 Serie A winnersBologna: 2024-25 Coppa Italia winnersInter: 2024-25 Serie A runners-upAC Milan: 2024-25 Coppa Italia runners-upHow to watch Napoli vs. AC Milan, oddsDate: Thursday, Dec. 18 | Time: 2 p.m. ETLocation: King Saud University Stadium -- Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Live stream: Paramount+Odds: Napoli +180; Draw +200; AC Milan +170How to watch Bologna vs. Inter, oddsDate: Friday, Dec. 19 | Time: 2 p.m. ETLocation: King Saud University Stadium -- Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Live stream: Paramount+Odds: Bologna +480; Draw +280; Inter -170When is the final taking place? The final will take place on Monday, Dec 22, at 2 p.m. ET on Paramount+.Who won last year? \nLast year's edition saw an incredible comeback from AC Milan, who won the Supercoppa Italiana final 3-2 against Inter after an intense second half, where they scored three goals to defeat the side then coached by Simone Inzaghi, which managed to go up 2-0 shortly after halftime. Tammy Abraham's winning goal during stoppage time gave then-Rossoneri manager Sergio Conceicao his first trophy at the club, seven days after he replaced Paulo Fonseca on the bench of the Italian giants ahead of the tournament. Team newsThere is some major news ahead of the Supercoppa Italiana final four as Romelu Lukaku was included in the Napoli squad travelling to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday by manager Antonio Conte. The Belgian striker suffered a muscular injury on Aug.16 that prevented him from playing the first months of the 2025-26 season and Napoli were forced to sign another striker in the last days of the summer transfer window, when they signed Rasmus Hojlund from Manchester United on loan with an obligation to buy for $70 million. Lukaku is unlikely to play the semifinal against AC Milan but this is a first sign he's coming back soon. \nElsewhere, Inter right wing-back Denzel Dumfries has undergone surgery on his ankle injury and will be sidelined for at least three months, with a return expected in March. The decision to proceed with surgery was made in agreement with the club, which is now likely to sign another winger during the winter transfer window. This move also comes amid awareness of Dumfries' $25 million release clause, set to become active in the summer of 2026 and potentially attractive to several European clubs. Something similar is about to happen for Mexican striker Santiago Gimenez, who will undergo surgery this week and will miss at least two months of action. AC Milan are also likely to sign a striker in the January transfer window, regardless of what happens with Gimenez.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        As Michigan conducts an investigation into its own athletic department in the wake of the firing of football coach Sherrone Moore, the school is willing to \"act swiftly\" if new findings warrant more terminations. Interim university president Domenico Grasso shared that sentiment -- and laid out the requirements for the next football coach -- in a video statement on Wednesday.Michigan has enlisted the services of Chicago-based law firm Jenner & Block to conduct a comprehensive review of the entire athletic department. A source described the probe to CBS Sports' Brandon Marcello as \"open-ended\" to the point that the university is unsure what it might uncover.If it does produce evidence of misconduct, Grasso said the school won't hesitate to act.\"We will take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that conduct like this does not happen again,\" Grasso said. \"Make no mistake. We will leave no stone unturned, and any further action we take will be based on credible evidence and findings, developed through a rigorous investigation. If the university learns of information through this investigation or otherwise that warrants a termination of any employee, we will act swiftly, just as we did in the case of Coach Moore.\"Grasso said the scope of the Jenner & Block investigation has been expanded to include \"an independent evaluation of culture, conduct and procedures throughout our athletics department.\"\n\n        \n            \n                Michigan board authorizes expanded probe into athletic department after Sherrone Moore firing\n                \n                    Brandon Marcello                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMoore was fired for having an inappropriate relationship with a staff member and now faces three charges, including felony home invasion, for allegedly \"unlawfully entering the victim's residence\" after his firing. With the Wolverines now exploring their options on the coaching market, Grasso said the next coach must have high \"moral character\" in addition to being a \"fierce competitor.\"\"As we conduct our search for the next head football coach, we intend to hire an individual who can and will instill that spirit and who will represent the highest values that our university holds dear,\" Grasso said. \"We will hire an individual of the highest moral character and who will serve as a role model and respected leader for the whole football program and who will, with dignity and integrity, be a fierce competitor.\"\nBiff Poggi is currently serving as the interim coach and will be in that role at least through the Citrus Bowl against Texas on Dec. 31. Poggi is considered a potential bridge option for the Wolverines in 2026 if other potential candidates like Alabama's Kalen DeBoer, Washington's Jedd Fisch and Arizona State's Kenny Dillingham opt to stick with their current schools. \n            ",

    "body": "\nJaxon Smith-Njigba is having a historic season for the Seattle Seahawks, and he'll be a focal point in arguably the biggest game in the NFC West this season when they host the Los Angeles Rams for Thursday Night Football. First place in the division will be on the line, and Smith-Njigba had nine catches for 105 yards in Seattle's first meeting with Los Angeles, but failed to get into the endzone in a 21-19 defeat. However, he's scored at least once in seven of his last 11 games, and he's priced at +115 in the latest Seahawks vs. Rams anytime touchdown scorer odds from DraftKings. That's why he's one of the SportsLine Projection Model's top TNF anytime TD scorer picks.\nTargeting NFL player props is one way to approach NFL odds at online sports betting sites for Thursday Night Football in Week 16. With NFL props available for almost every player in Rams vs. Seahawks at top online sportsbooks, SportsLine's proven computer model can help you find value to add to your Seattle vs. Los Angeles NFL picks. New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters Week 16 on a sizzling 52-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns. Now, it has revealed its top anytime touchdown picks for Seahawks vs. Rams.Best Thursday Night Football anytime TD prop picks:Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Seahawks (+115)Zach Charbonnet, Seahawks (+170)Blake Corum, Rams (+240)\nJaxon Smith-Njigba, Seahawks (+115)In addition to having a fighting chance of breaking Calvin Johnson's record for receiving yards in a single season (1,964), Smith-Njigba leads Seattle with nine touchdowns this year. Despite only playing in 74.8% of Seattle's offensive sets this season (44th among qualifying WRs), Smith-Njigba leads the NFL with a 35.0% target share, and his 23 deep targets (20 yards or more) also leads the league. The model predicts that he scores 0.54 touchdowns on average, while these odds imply a 46.5% chance to find the endzone.\nZach Charbonnet, Seahawks (+170)Charbonnet and Kenneth Walker III continue to split time in the Seattle backfield, and Walker has probably been the more efficient Seahawks running back this season. However, Charbonnet has been the preferred goal-to-go option and has scored seven of his eight touchdowns on the year from inside the 10-yard line. He's scored in seven of Seattle's 13 games this season, so finding significantly plus-money odds here is a potential boon. The model predicts 0.48 TDs on average, while the odds imply a 37% chance to score.\nBlake Corum, Rams (+240)Kyren Williams is still one of the most effective running backs in the NFL, but Blake Corum has forced his way into a more meaningful role in Sean McVay's offense. He's carried the ball 30 times for 280 yards and four touchdowns in his last three games and his snap share rose to a season-high 45.8% last week against the Lions. Corum has even pilfered some of the goal-to-go work that Williams has dominated this season, scoring three short-yardage touchdowns and five overall. The model predicts 0.30 touchdowns on average, while the odds suggest a 29.4% chance to score.\nWant more Thursday Night Football picks?You've seen the model's NFL anytime touchdown prop picks for several players in Rams vs. Seahawks.

Rioux, who stands at 7-foot-9, became the tallest player in college basketball history -- at any level -- to score a basket. His lone points of the game came with 42 seconds remaining, when he threw down a two-handed flush.Rioux, 19, had previously appeared in two games this season for the reigning national champions. Rioux logged two minutes against North Florida last month and scored the first points of his college career against Merrimack two weeks later. The center from Canada logged three minutes in that game and went 1 of 2 from the free-throw line.Here is Rioux's basket against Saint Francis that made history.\nIn 2021, Guinness World Records declared Rioux the tallest teenager in the world at 7-foot-5. When he checked in against North Florida last month, he became the tallest college basketball player ever to appear in a game.\"It felt great,\" Rioux, who redshirted his first season with the Gators, said after his first career game. \"The support from everybody was amazing, even on the bench and even the fans. I think everybody supported me. I'm very grateful.\"\nRioux did not appear in a game during the 2024-25 campaign for the Gators. Florida has one of the deepest frontcourts in the nation, led by Thomas Haugh, Alex Condon, Micah Handlogten and Rueben Chinyelu. Although Rioux isn't part of the rotation yet, Wednesday was a positive sign for his overall development.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        A fresh take on exhibition golf will take place under the lights on Wednesday when Scottie Scheffler, Rory McIlroy and their respective squads face off against one another at Trump National Golf Club. Dubbed the 2025 Golf Channel Games, the exhibition will see two teams of four compete in a series of fun, fast-paced events designed to mimic challenges from other sports leagues.Scheffler and McIlroy teamed up victoriously this time last year in Las Vegas for an exhibition match against LIV Golf members Brooks Koepka and Bryson DeChambeau, but this time, they will be on opposite sides.The two teams will traverse through a series of five challenges -- timed driving, timed short game, timed relay, 14-club challenge and finally a head-to-head matchup between Scheffler and McIlroy where they will strike shots from specific areas against one another. Whichever team garners the most points will win the overall competition.Golf Channel Games teamsEach team features a good friend to the de facto captain, a familiar face from the Ryder Cup and somewhat of a wild card selection.\nRory McIlroyScottie SchefflerShane LowrySam BurnsLuke DonaldKeegan BradleyHaotong LiLuke ClantonGolf Channel Games formatTimed drive competition: Players compete head-to-head with two minutes on the clock, launching drives onto a scoring grid. Timed short-game competition: This consists of individual action with players chipping the ball within a certain distance of the pin and holing out a specific number of putts at a distance, all with 3 minutes set on the clock.Team relay: Strategy will be crucial here as each team of four will play alternate shot across three holes. Teammates will be staged in certain positions -- one on the tee, one in the fairway, two on and around the greens -- and whichever side finishes with the best score in the shortest amount of time wins.14-club challenge: Two players will compete head-to-head. The groups of two will pull clubs from the same golf bag and strike shots from predetermined distances in the fairway during a closest-to-the-pin contest. Once a club is used, it is eliminated, meaning each player will strike seven different shots with all 14 clubs used. All eight players in the competition will compete across four head-to-head matchups.Captain's challenge: McIlroy and Scheffler will battle head-to-head. Each player will strike shots from various distances, a bunker, greenside and putts of 30 feet and 10 feet. Whomever has the lowest combined distance from the hole for the shots will win.Where to watch Golf Channel gamesDate: Wednesday, Dec. 17 | Start time: 7:30 p.m. ET Course: Trump National Golf Club — Jupiter, FloridaTV: Golf Channel, USA NetworkStreaming: Fubo (Try for free)\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Three 2025-26 college football bowl games in the books, but some bowl confidence pools remain open as there are more than 30 matchups remaining to make college football bowl picks on this season. The two biggest spreads are in the CFP first round as Oregon is favored by 21.5 points over James Madison, while Ole Miss is a 17.5-point favorite over Tulane. While putting faith in big favorites is a part of just about everyone's college football bowl confidence strategy, correctly predicting a couple upsets can give you a big edge in any football pools. Anticipated matchups outside of the CFP include Penn State vs. Clemson (-3.5), Vanderbilt (-5.5) vs. Iowa, Georgia Tech vs. BYU (-4.5), Tennessee vs. Illinois (+2.5) and Michigan vs. Texas (-7.5). The Wolverines will operate under interim head coach Biff Poggi after dismissing Sherrone Moore.

Not only is this game in Texas, but it's in Houston, providing the obvious home-field advantage for the Cougars, as LSU has lost its last four games outside of Tiger Stadium. Meanwhile, the Cougars are 5-1 straight-up when favored this season, and the Tigers' offense limps into this matchup as it has a total of four touchdowns over the last four games and won't have quarterback Garrett Nussmeier, as Michael Van Buren Jr. will make the start. Those four TDs are the same number that Houston had in its last game, alone, as the model has the Cougars winning in 80% of simulations. See all of the model's college football bowl confidence picks here.Another one of the bowl confidence predictions the model is high on: No. 16 USC (-3.5), who will have quarterback Jayden Maiava, gets a comfortable win over TCU in the Alamo Bowl on Dec. 30. USC went 9-3 in the regular season, with all three defeats coming versus ranked teams. TCU found itself in the Top 25 once -- back in September -- before having a pedestrian run through the Big 12 schedule, finishing 5-4. Even with the Horned Frogs playing in the easier conference than the Trojans, USC both averaged more points and allowed fewer points per game. USC sports a 32-9 (78%) straight-up record when favored since Lincoln Riley came aboard in 2022, as it is projected to easily take care of business in San Antonio. SportsLine's model has the Trojans prevailing nearly 70% of the time. See the rest of the college football bowl confidence predictions here. How to make college football bowl confidence picksThe model has also made the call on who wins every other bowl game. There are 11 teams that win at least 70% of the time, so you need to go big on those matchups, as well as 15 underdogs that win outright. You can get all the model's picks at SportsLine.So who wins every college football bowl game, and which matchups should you assign the most confidence points to?

    "body": "\n        One day after Miami Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel said \"everything is on the table\" regarding benching Tua Tagovailoa, McDaniel followed through. With Miami officially eliminated from playoff contention, rookie quarterback Quinn Ewers will start for the Dolphins in Week 16 against the Cincinnati Bengals, McDaniel told reporters Wednesday.Zach Wilson will be Ewers' primary backup; Tagovailoa will be the emergency third-string quarterback.\"The decision is complicated but simple,\" McDaniel said Wednesday. \"The simple piece is I think Quinn gives this team the best chance to win. Our focus is, obviously, to win the next three games, but in particular, like I told the players, we are focused on beating the Bengals, so that was the motivation.\"McDaniel said the decision \"wasn't easy for [Tagovailoa] to hear\" but that he \"exhibited what makes him a captain and a leader on this team.\"\n\n        \n            \n                Tua's ride is over: Dolphins staring down an expensive divorce as they turn -- for now -- to Quinn Ewers\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTagovailoa, 27, went 22 for 28 for 253 yards, two touchdowns and an interception and took four sacks in Miami's 28-15 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers on Monday night, but the box score doesn't reflect how poorly he played. Both touchdowns came after the game had already gotten well out of hand. Through three quarters, he recorded just 65 passing yards and an interception.\"Well I think the quarterback play last night was not good enough, and so for me, everything is on the table,\" McDaniel said Tuesday.In 14 games, Tagovailoa completed 67.7% of his passes for 2,660 yards, 20 touchdowns and a league-leading 15 interceptions, which also marks a career high. The Dolphins won four straight games entering the \"Monday Night Football\" contest against the Steelers, but that had often been in spite of Tagovailoa, who only threw three touchdown passes with three interceptions over that span.\nTagovailoa said he and McDaniel had a brief conversation Wednesday and said he was \"disappointed\" to hear of his demotion.\"I would say the biggest thing, and it's being honest with myself as well, has been my performance,\" Tagovailoa said. \"I haven't been performing up to the level or the capabilities that I have in the past.\"Tagovailoa said injuries have not played a role in his poor performance and added that his job, even as a backup, is to help the team win games. Asked about his future with the Dolphins -- a decision that has quickly come into view with this move -- Tagovailoa said he can only control what he can control.\nTagovailoa signed a four-year, $212.4 million contract extension with $167 million in guarantees in July 2024. Moving on from Tagovailoa this offseason would be difficult for Miami. The former No. 5 overall pick is signed through 2028, and he carries a $56.4 million cap hit in 2026. Still, his benching could mark the beginning of the end of the Tagovailoa era in Miami.And Tagovailoa might not be the only notable player from the last few seasons moving on. Tyreek Hill, who suffered a season-ending knee injury in late September, reacted to Tagovailoa's benching with a viral GIF of a man disappearing.\nCBS Sports' Jonathan Jones had previously reported the Dolphins are expected to move on from Hill after this season.\n            ",

    "body": "\nAfter seven seasons of mediocrity or worse, the South Florida Bulls enjoyed their greatest success since posting a 10-2 record in 2017, winning nine of their 12 regular-season games. They now have the opportunity to win their third straight bowl game and fifth in six attempts, but they'll have to do it with an interim head coach and backup quarterback.Defensive line coach Kevin Patrick and No. 2 QB Gaston Moore lead the charge when South Florida takes on Old Dominion (9-3) at 5 p.m. ET in the Cure Bowl at Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Fla. Patrick has taken over the head-coaching position on an interim basis following the departure of Alex Golesh, who was hired by Auburn in late November. Moore makes the first start in the final game of his collegiate career as Byrum Brown has elected to sit out the contest after having a stellar regular season.South Florida, which rolled past Rice 52-3 in their regular-season finale, has scored a total of 86 points in its last two bowl appearances. Under Golesh, the Bulls trounced Syracuse 45-0 in the 2023 Boca Raton Bowl and edged San Jose State 41-39 in five overtimes in last year's Hawaii Bowl to improve to 8-4 in bowl games.Old Dominion is making its fourth appearance in a bowl game. After defeating Eastern Michigan 24-20 in the 2016 Bahamas Bowl, the Monarchs lost to Tulsa 30-17 in the 2021 Myrtle Beach Bowl and dropped a 38-35 decision in overtime to Western Kentucky in the Famous Toastery Bowl two years later. Later Wednesday, Louisiana (6-6) and Delaware (6-6) square off at 8 p.m. ET in the 68 Ventures Bowl at Hancock Whitney Stadium in Mobile, Ala. The Ragin' Cajuns were crushed by TCU 34-3 in last year's New Mexico Bowl, while the Blue Hens are making their first bowl game appearance since falling 17-14 to Eastern Kentucky in the 1982 Pioneer Bowl.Only two games are on Wednesday's NBA schedule, including a matchup between the Memphis Grizzlies (12-14) and Minnesota TImberwolves (17-9) at 8 p.m. ET at the Target Center in Minneapolis. The Timberwolves hope to remain hot, as they've won seven of their last eight overall contests and six of seven at home.Five contests are on the NHL slate, one of which has the red-hot Carolina Hurricanes (21-9-2) visiting Bridgestone Arena to face off against the Nashville Predators (13-15-4) at 8 p.m. ET. The Hurricanes occupy first place in the Metropolitan Division and are in the midst of a four-game winning streak, with each of the last three being shootout victories.Meanwhile, an abundance of college basketball games take place on Wednesday, with one being a clash between 13th-ranked Vanderbilt (10-0) and Memphis (4-5) at 7 p.m. ET at the FedExForum. The Tigers had their three-game winning streak snapped by No. 11 Louisville on Saturday but are looking to hand the Commodores their first loss of the season. South Florida is a 3-point favorite against Old Dominion in the latest consensus college football odds, while Louisiana is a 2.5-point favorite versus Delaware. The Timberwolves are 7.5-favorites against the Grizzlies, the Hurricanes are -184 on the money line against the Predators and Vanderbilt is a 9.5-point favorite versus Memphis.Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Wednesday, Dec. 17. All times EasternCFB best bets, where to watchOld Dominion vs. South FloridaTime: 5 p.m. | Location: Orlando, Fla. | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Old Dominion +3 (-114) | Expert: Under 53.5 points (-109, Mike Tierney)All but one of South Florida's nine victories this season were lopsided, as the Bulls won those eight contests by 27 or more points. But they're without starting quarterback Byrum Brown, who became the 12th player in FBS history to pass for 3,000 yards (3,158) and rush for 1,000 (1,008) in the same season, and are running into an Old Dominion squad that is on a five-game winning streak and outscored its last four opponents 136-26. Even though Monarchs QB Colton Joseph also opted out of the game, the SportsLine Projection Model is backing Old Dominion, which wins in 53% of its simulations. SportsLine expert Mike Tierney (5-0 on his last five South Florida over/under picks) believes the combination of backup quarterbacks and solid defenses will result in the Cure Bowl being a low-scoring affair.Louisiana vs. DelawareTime: 8:30 p.m. | Location: Mobile, Ala. | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine pick -- Model: Louisiana -133The teams enter the 68 Ventures Bowl with .500 records, but the Ragin' Cajuns definitely come into the matchup with more momentum. Louisiana ended its regular season with four consecutive victories while Delaware, which is making its first bowl game appearance in 43 years, lost three of its final five contests. Louisiana possesses one of the better ground attacks in the nation as it ranked 29th with an average of 189.8 yards per game, with three players gaining more than 625 yards. Since Delaware is 89th against the run (164.3 yards allowed), the SportsLine Projection Model sees the Ragin' Cajuns running to victory as its simulations have them winning 74% of the time.NBA best bets, where to watchGrizzlies at TimberwolvesTime: 8 p.m. | Location: Minneapolis | TV: NBA TV | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Under 230.5 (-111) | Expert: Jaren Jackson Jr. Under 5.5 rebounds (-147, Mike Barner)The Timberwolves and Grizzlies both rank in the top of the NBA in points allowed, as the former is ninth (114.5) and the latter 12th (115.4). Minnesota is sixth in the league in scoring (119.8 points), but three of their last four games have gone Under the projected total for Wednesday's matchup. Five of Memphis' last seven contests have done the same, and the SportsLine Projection Model sees the trends continuing as the Under hits in more than 56% of its simulations. Grizzlies forward Jaren Jackson Jr. is averaging five rebounds this season and has grabbed fewer than six in six of his last eight outings, leading SportsLine NBA expert Mike Barner (7-4 on his last 11 NBA player prop picks) to think he won't do so against a Timberwolves team that is 11th in fewest boards allowed per game.NHL best bets, where to watchHurricanes at PredatorsTime: 8 p.m. | Location: Nashville | TV: ESPN+ | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Under 6 (-104) | Expert: Predators +1.5 (-166, Matt Severance)Even though they are on a four-game winning streak, the Hurricanes haven't been lighting up the scoreboard. The club has scored three goals or fewer in each of its last three contests and six of its past eight. Nashville has netted at least five tallies twice in its last three outings but ranks 26th in the NHL with an average of 2.81 per game. Taking those things into consideration, the SportsLine Projection Model is calling for a low-scoring contest as its simulations have the Under hitting close to 54% of the time. SportsLine expert Matt Severance (4-1-1, +265 on his last six Carolina against-the-spread picks) agrees and likes the Predators to cover as goaltender Juuse Saros has posted a 2.53 goals-against average and .920 save percentage this month.CBB best bets, where to watchVanderbilt at MemphisTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Memphis | TV: ESPN2 | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Over 158.5 (-112) | Expert: Vanderbilt -7.5 (-108, Bruce Marshall)The Tigers have held their opponents to 42.7% shooting this season, but they'll be hard-pressed to contain Vanderbilt. The Commodores are making 51.6% of their shots and are fifth in the nation with an average of 95.4 points per game. Louisville scored 99 points against Memphis last Saturday, and Vanderbilt has put up 88 or more in eight of its 10 contests this season. The SportsLine Projection Model thinks the Commodores will come close to that number on Wednesday, and the Over hits almost 53% of the time in its simulations. SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall (+459 on his last 15 college basketball picks) expects Vanderbilt to cover the spread behind guard Duke Miles, who is averaging a team-leading 16.6 points in his first season with the school.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The injury to Green Bay Packers' star edge rusher Micah Parsons sent shockwaves through the NFL. Not only was it the second high profile torn ACL to rock the NFL, but it also dramatically shifts the chances of the Packers winning a Super Bowl. Parsons' gravity and force as a pass rusher completely changed the outlook of the Packers defense when the blockbuster trade was made in the offseason, and now without him Packers' defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley needs to reach deep into the bag of tricks to keep the Packers Super Bowl hopes alive.If the saying \"a rising tide lifts all boats\" was one person, it would be Parsons on this defense. The raw numbers by themselves are just nuts: Parsons' 12.5 sacks are tied for the most in any single season for a Packer defender since Za'Darius Smith in 2020, his 19.4% pressure rate is also the highest for any Packer in that same time period (min. 200 pass rush snaps).But even when you dig beyond that, the impact of Parsons when on the field can be felt at every level of the defense. Green Bay's biggest weakness on defense is their outside cornerbacks; Carrington Valentine and Keisean Nixon are both volatile on the outside and better playing the ball in front of them instead of consistently making plays downfield. Well, with Parsons on the field the offense has to change how they play. Parsons is tied for second in the NFL in quick pressures with 33, meaning he's getting to the QB in three seconds or less. Defensive backs know the ball has to be out quick, so they can play aggressively downhill, keeping them in the flat to shut off any water on checkdowns.\n        \n            \n                Prisco's Week 16 NFL picks: Seahawks top Rams on 'TNF,' Packers edge Bears, Jaguars upset Broncos\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHafley weaponizes Parsons' speed in the defense, forcing QBs to get rid of the ball quickly by showing various pressure looks without actually sending blitzes, knowing that Parsons can also get home quickly. If the Packers can get you to pass protect using five one-on-ones instead of helping on Parsons, they like those odds.\nHow the Packers will rebound without Parsons is going to be one of the most fascinating things to watch as the season comes to an end. Without Parsons last season, the bones and schematics of the Packers' defense was still good, but the defense lacked the punch up front. The biggest issue is that without Parsons there's nobody who can get to the QB quick enough to cause problems for opposing offenses. Nobody else on the Packers has more than seven quick pressures this season, and nobody up front has a pressure rate over 13%. The Packers' edge defenders outside of Parsons are all built similarly: bulky, hulking pass rushers who win with power, but not enough flexibility or burst to truly make their power work consistently. If you combine pass rushers who win late, with an outside cornerback group that is a bit suspect when having to play downfield you get a defense susceptible to big plays and the reason why the Packers went out and traded for Micah Parsons.So, with all of the reasons why Parsons changes their defense listed out above, it surely means this season is over, right? While I think their path to a Super Bowl gets much, much thinner without Parsons, I do think their defense is still talented enough and well coached, so they should still be a playoff-caliber team. Where they'll have to adjust is by potentially bringing more pressure via blitzing.\nIn Hafley's time as defensive coordinator, they've never blitzed more than 22% and mainly use those various fronts to cause confusion for the offensive line so their pass rushers can take advantage. Yet, without Parsons their blitz rate goes from 20.7% to 26.6%, a clear indication that they want to manufacture pressure using players from depth instead of just letting Parsons go to work. I think LB Edgerrin Cooper could be the lynchpin behind the Packers' defense continuing to tread water and not completely fold without Parsons. He's grown a lot in his second year, especially in coverage, but where he's at his best is as a blitzer. His speed is game changing, not exactly on Parsons level but it's enough to force teams to account for him as a blitzer.I even think LB Quay Walker can be an effective blitzer to help sort of recreate Parsons' impact in the aggregate. I think pressures like this one, bringing Cooper as a blitzer, are going to be the pressure package du jour moving forward for Green Bay, because nobody else outside of Parsons quite has his closing speed as a blitzer. This play has Parsons on the field, but Cooper can win in this role.\nIt's going to take a team effort to fill the DPOY-sized hole Parsons is leaving on the field for Green Bay, and it might knock them off the perch of Super Bowl contenders. However, I think Hafley and co. still have a talented roster that can win by recreating Parsons in the aggregate to keep the defense above average until he comes back in 2026.\n            ",

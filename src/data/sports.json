    "body": "\n        Every smart Fantasy player (that's you reading this) knows that the waiver wire is the biggest key to a championship season. Whether it's a bye-week replacement or picking up the top handcuff due to an injury, these are players who could turn out to be the biggest difference makers on your roster.With that in mind, we always like to recognize the top waiver wire winners, and here are the best players you added in 2025. And we had quite an impressive list this season.These are players we highlighted on our waiver wire column during the season, and I hope you added them to your team. Most of these guys contributed to a lot of Fantasy titles in 2025.All Waiver Wire TeamQB: Matthew StaffordRB: Rico DowdleRB: Kenneth GainwellWR: Michael WilsonWR: Wan'Dale RobinsonWR: Quentin JohnstonTE: Kyle PittsFLEX: Harold Fannin Jr.Stafford was an obvious choice at quarterback, and he had a standout season as the No. 2 Fantasy quarterback behind only Josh Allen. Two other quarterbacks who were waiver wire stars are Jacoby Brissett and Jaxson Dart. Brissett took over for Kyler Murray (foot) in Week 6 and scored at least 20.5 Fantasy points in 10 of 11 starts. And Dart became the starter for the Giants in Week 4 and scored at least 21.8 Fantasy points in eight of 11 games.\nChuba Hubbard missed Weeks 5 and 6 with a calf injury, and Dowdle scored at least 32.4 PPR points in each outing against Miami and Dallas. He became the starter for the Panthers from that point forward, and Dowdle was a serviceable No. 2 Fantasy running back with six games of at least 12.4 PPR points in his final 12 outings.Gainwell had a huge game in Week 4 against Minnesota when Jaylen Warren was out due to injury with 31.4 PPR points. Gainwell then slowly emerged as the best running back for the Steelers down the stretch, especially with his role in the passing game, and he scored at least 16.2 PPR points in five of his final seven games.Marvin Harrison missed four games this season and left early in another, and Wilson was the best receiver in Fantasy in those five outings. He averaged 25.8 PPR points over that span, and he was a must-start Fantasy receiver whenever Harrison was out.\nRobinson had a huge game for the Giants in Week 2 with 28.2 PPR points, but he really took off once Malik Nabers (knee) was lost for the season in Week 4. Robinson scored at least 13.6 PPR points in six of his final 11 games, and he was the No. 1 target for Dart once he became the starting quarterback.Johnston's production tailed off as the season went on, but he was a must-start receiver early in the year after he averaged 19.9 PPR points in his first four games. He also scored at least 14.8 PPR points in each of his final two games in the Fantasy playoffs, and he had a better season than Ladd McConkey with 12.2 PPR points per game compared to 11.3.Pitts finished as the No. 2 tight end in total points behind only Trey McBride. And Pitts closed the season on a high note with at least 15 PPR points in four of his final five games, including 45.6 PPR points in Week 15 against Tampa Bay, which was the fifth-best performance of any player this season.\nFannin scored at least 11 PPR points in each of his final five games, with four touchdowns over that span, and he was the No. 5 tight end in total points for the season. He overcame poor quarterback play and competing for production with David Njoku to finish as the best rookie tight end in 2025.Best Draft ValuesQB: Matthew Stafford - 151.1RB: Travis Etienne - 92.9RB: Javonte Williams - 112.4WR: George Pickens - 65.6WR: Jameson Williams - 67.3WR: Chris Olave - 102.8TE: Tyler Warren - 94.6FLEX: Quinshon Judkins - 114.7\n            ",

That matchup kicks off at 7:30 p.m. ET, and will be preceded by regular bowl matchups like Iowa vs. Vanderbilt in the ReliaQuest Bowl at noon ET and Utah vs. Nebraska in the Las Vegas Bowl at 3:30 p.m. ET.  According to the latest college football odds, Ohio State is favored by 9.5 over Miami while the over/under is 41.5 points, and the Over is one of the SportsLine Projection Model's top plays on Wednesday.The model is also backing Nebraska (+14) to cover the spread against Utah and Iowa to win outright (+154) against Vanderbilt. Before locking in your college football picks for Wednesday, Dec. 31, be sure to check out the top college football betting picks from SportsLine's advanced computer model. New users can also target the latest DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times, and it is 31-19 on its top-rated college football money-line picks since the beginning of the 2024 season.

Bet it now at Caesars Sportsbook: \nIowa money line vs. Vanderbilt Kirk Ferentz expects his team to be fully intact for the 2025 ReliaQuest Bowl at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa on Wednesday, but the Commodores will be down Mackey Award winning tight end Eli Stowers after he opted out to begin preparing for the 2026 NFL Draft. With Diego Pavia's top receiver out of action, expect the Iowa defense to load up to stop the Heisman Trophy runner-up and for Iowa to be the more motivated program with Vanderbilt feeling snubbed by the CFP selection committee. The model predicts that Iowa wins outright in 51% of simulations, while these odds imply a 39.2% chance to win.Nebraska +14 vs. Utah Dylan Raiola had Nebraska looking like it was on the verge of a turnaround before suffering losses to Minnesota and USC, where he also suffered a season-ending injury. Now he's entering the transfer portal, and Matt Rhule is turning to true freshman quarterback TJ Lateef, who took over as the starter when Raiola was injured. Lateef suffered a hamstring injury against Iowa to end the regular season, but has been given a clean bill of health. Meanwhile, Utah just lost Kyle Whittingham to Michigan and is down its two starting offensive tackles, two best defensive ends, and its leading receiver because of either opt-out or injury. The model predicts that the Cornhuskers cover in 63% of simulations.Over 41.5 points in Ohio State vs. Miami Miami just won a 10-3 slugfest against Texas A&M in the first round, while Ohio State suffered a 13-10 loss to Indiana in its most recent outing at the Big Ten Championship Game. Those recent results and the fact that both defenses rank in the top five nationally in points allowed are obviously driving this total down. However, the Buckeyes' offense came alive during last year's national title run. Ohio State scored 145 points combined in wins over Tennessee, Oregon, Texas, and Notre Dame, and the Buckeyes have the skill-position talent to force the Hurricanes to try to keep up. The Over hits in 57% of the model's simulations.Want more college football picks?You've seen the model's college football best bets for Wednesday, Dec. 31.

    "body": "\nMany observers didn't feel that the Alabama Crimson Tide deserved a place in the College Football Playoff, but the Tide won a wild first-round road game against the Oklahoma Sooners to secure a ticket to the Rose Bowl to take on the top-seeded Indiana Hoosiers. Coach Curt Cignetiti has powered Indiana to the forefront of the college football world, with Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Fernando Mendoza at the helm of one of the nation's best offenses. Alabama skipper Kalen DeBoer will have his hands full on New Year's Day. Kickoff at the Rose Bowl is set for 4 p.m. ET on Jan. 1. The Hoosiers are seven-point favorites in the latest SportsLine consensus Alabama vs. Indiana odds, and the over/under for total points scored is 48.5. Indiana is a -251 money line favorite (wager $251 to win $100), while the Crimson Tide are +205 underdogs. Before you make any Alabama vs. Indiana picks of your own, make sure you see the top college football picks from the SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every college football game 10,000 times.\nWhere to watch Alabama vs. Indiana on ThursdayWhen: Thursday, Jan. 1Time: 4 p.m. ETTV: ESPNStream: Fubo  Follow along: CBS Sports AppAlabama vs. Indiana betting previewOdds: Indiana -7, Over/Under 48.5\nIndiana enters the Rose Bowl with the nation's fourth-best scoring offense at 41.9 points per game, behind just North Texas, Texas Tech and Notre Dame (the team that had the best claim to the spot Alabama claimed in the playoff). The Hoosiers are also elite on defense, having allowed the fourth-fewest yards per game (257.2) and second-fewest points per game (10.8). Mendoza's Heisman Trophy campaign resulted in 2,980 passing yards, 33 passing touchdowns, a 181.4 rating and an additional six scores on the ground. The standout quarterback is a candidate to go first overall in the upcoming NFL Draft. Alabama's output wasn't quite as explosive. The Crimson Tide averaged 380.1 yards per game on offense and scored 31.4 ppg. The Bama defense conceded 288.9 yards per game (13th in the nation) and 17.9 points per game (also 13th). Tide quarterback Ty Simpson is also expected to be a first-round pick. The Hoosiers are 8-5 against the spread this season, while the Tide are 9-5. Indiana is 8-5 to the Over and Alabama is 9-5 to the Under. Both teams have covered three of their last five games. Four of the last five Alabama games have gone Under.Model's Alabama vs. Indiana score prediction, picksThe model expects a tight game.

    "body": "\n        The Baltimore Ravens surprisingly have one more chance to potentially save their season when they visit the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 18. Whether Lamar Jackson (back contusion) would be a part of that effort remains up in the air, though things are trending in a positive direction as Jackson is expected to participate in Wednesday's practice, per NFL Media.Baltimore coach John Harbaugh told reporters Monday that the team would have more information about its star quarterback's status come their first practice, saying, \"He's coming off a very serious injury, and he's working at it -- saw him in here today working at it -- so I think we'll know a lot more on Wednesday.\"Jackson dealt with a plethora of injuries this year, not just an early-season hamstring strain (missed three games) and his current back contusion. Ankle, toe and knee issues and popped up for Jackson on the injury report throughout the year, and he has had just one full week of practice since returning from the hamstring injury. The back contusion was significant enough that Jackson struggled to even toss a ball with a member of the team's training staff in the locker room during the Week 16 game against the New England Patriots, and he did not practice at all leading up to last week's game against the Green Bay Packers.\"It was not good at all early in the week, and it improved as the week went on, and that was cause for optimism,\" Harbaugh said Monday.\n        \n            \n                NFL playoff picture: Ravens-Steelers decide AFC North in Week 18; Seahawks-49ers play for No. 1 seed in NFC\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAfter Week 16, the Ravens' playoff hopes appeared slim: Baltimore blew a 11-point fourth quarter lead in a 28-24 loss to New England -- a game Jackson left in the first half after getting kneed in the back by safety Craig Woodson. \nFurthermore, the Steelers dramatically held off the Detroit Lions, 29-24. That meant either a Ravens loss or a Steelers win in Week 17 would hand the division to Pittsburgh. But the Ravens did their part, beating the Packers 41-24 behind a 216-yard, four-touchdown performance by Derrick Henry and solid play by Jackson's backup, Tyler Huntley, on Saturday night. Then the Cleveland Browns upset the Steelers 13-6 on Sunday, pushing the AFC North race to the final week.Huntley, 27, would again get the call against Pittsburgh if Jackson cannot play. He went 16 for 20 for 107 yards and a touchdown and ran for 60 yards against Green Bay.\"A+,\" Harbaugh said after the game. \"A+. Give [Huntley] two pluses on top of that, maybe three. That's how it was. It couldn't have been any better. I just thought [he had] some of the clutch plays -- the kind of plays that you have to make. I see Tyler every day in practice, so I'm not surprised. I see him execute every day in practice, but for him to make the third-down conversions, the scramble plays, the throws, the on-time throws, the accurate throws that he made to run the offense in Lambeau field -- it's loud. In Lambeau Field, to run the offense the way he did, make the checks the way he did, get us in the plays we needed to get in, just A+.\"\nHarbaugh said Monday that the team's confidence in Huntley would not factor into the Jackson decision and that if Jackson is ready to play, he will play.\n            ",

We'll be into 2026 in short order and then, before you know it, spring training camps will open and baseball will be back. There are still a lot of free agents to sign and trades to be made between now and then. Here are Wednesday's hot stove rumors.  A's interested in more extensions After locking up Tyler Soderstrom long-term, the Athletics have interest in signing more of their core players to contract extensions, reports The Athletic. First baseman Nick Kurtz and shortstop Jacob Wilson finished 1-2 in the AL Rookie of the Year voting this past season and are obvious extension candidates. Catcher Shea Langeliers as well. Kurtz and Wilson are both five years away from free agency. Here are the largest extensions given to position players at their service time level: \nJackson Merrill, Padres: 9 years, $135 millionKe'Bryan Hayes, Pirates: 8 years, $70 millionLawrence Butler, Athletics: 7 years, $65.5 millionEzequiel Tovar, Rockies: 7 years, $63.5 millionAndrelton Simmons, Braves: 7 years, $58 millionKurtz certainly has a case to beat Merrill's deal given his monstrous rookie season. Langeliers is three years away from free agency and could be the Athletics' top extension priority just because he's closer to hitting the market than Kurtz and Wilson. With or without the extensions, the A's have a very strong position player core. Improving the pitching is the next order of business.  \tAngels sign Yates \nThe Angels are signing veteran righty Kirby Yates to a one-year contract worth $5 million, according to the New York Post. Yates, 38, struggled with the Dodgers this past season and was left off their postseason roster because of back and hamstring trouble. He is a year removed from a dynamite 2024 season with the Rangers, however. Yates went 33 for 34 in save chances with a 1.17 ERA that year and finished eighth in the AL Cy Young voting. For an Angels team with a less than imposing bullpen, gambling $5 million on Yates isn't the worst idea. He joins Drew Pomeranz and Jordan Romano as the team's offseason relief additions. \n \tWhite Sox sign Kelenic \nThe White Sox are bringing outfielder Jarred Kelenic to spring training on a minor league contract, reports ESPN. Once one of the top prospects in the game, Kelenic has failed to launch at the MLB level. The 26 year old is a career .211/.282/.376 hitter in parts of five big-league seasons with the Mariners and Braves. Kelenic slashed .213/.286/.309 with Atlanta's Triple-A affiliate in 2025. The ChiSox are not blessed with much outfield depth and Luis Robert Jr. is likely to get traded at some point. Kelenic isn't a terrible roll of the dice for a team still in the fairly early stages of a rebuild. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The College Football Playoff quarterfinals open on New Year's Eve with what should be among the most tantalizing defensive battles of the entire postseason. No. 2 Ohio State and No. 10 Miami are in for a showdown in the Cotton Bowl that promises to be physical, low-scoring and high on elite talent at the point of attack.The Hurricanes already put on display this month their ability to win a game with such a formula. Their 10-3 win over No. 7 Texas A&M in the first round featured the only scoreless first half in CFP history and was a masterclass in dominance on the defensive front. Ohio State followed the same blueprint in the regular season to secure the No. 2 seed and a first-round bye, which gave the Buckeyes time to recharge in their hunt for a second straight national championship.A spot in the semifinals against either No. 3 Georgia or No. 6 Ole Miss is on the line.Where to watch Ohio State vs. Miami liveDate: Wednesday, Dec. 31 | Time: 7:30 p.m. ETLocation: AT&T Stadium -- Arlington, TexasTV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nOhio State vs. Miami: Players to watchJeremiah Smith, WR, Ohio State: If Miami has any chance of pulling off the upset, it has to contain Ohio State's elite stable with wide receivers, which starts with Jeremiah Smith. Many have tried, but few have even come close to stopping the sixth-place finisher in Heisman Trophy voting. Smith is the Big Ten leader with 80 catches and crossed the 1,000-yard threshold for the second time in as many years to open his career. He will be the most talented player on the field in the Cotton Bowl.Julian Sayin, QB, Ohio State: If the campaign ended today, Sayin would hold the NCAA single-season completion percentage record with his sparkling 78.4% mark. His debut as the Ohio State quarterback in 2025 has been nothing short of tremendous. Sayin benefits greatly from the best receiving corps in college football, but he is a premier talent in his own right and proved in the regular season that he can and will make every throw asked of him.Caleb Downs, S, Ohio State: The Buckeyes feature five All-Americans on their defense. Caleb Downs is the most highly regarded of the bunch and even finished ninth in Heisman Trophy voting. The nation's top safety covers the entire field with ease and, boasting an impeccable football IQ, is a leader in more ways than one for a defense that is statistically among the stingiest groups in modern college football history.\nMalachi Toney, WR, Miami: Miami may have to go punch-for-punch with Ohio State through the air in order to hang with the Buckeyes, and it might just be capable of doing so because of Malachi Toney. The most electrifying freshman in the country racked up 89 catches for 992 yards and an ACC-best eight touchdowns through his first 13 games. That does not even cover what he does on the ground and on special teams as a special all-around contributor.Rueben Bain Jr., DL, Miami: All-American pass rusher Rueben Bain Jr. enjoyed the best game of his career with three sacks in the first-round matchup with Texas A&M. He was integral in the Hurricanes' defensive masterclass, in which it limited the Aggies to just three points. And that performance came as no surprise given his multi-year track record as an unstoppable force on a formidable defensive front.Carson Beck, QB, Miami: Carson Beck is quietly playing his best football of the season at the perfect time. While his 10 interceptions are the most among ACC quarterbacks, he threw just one in his last five games and completed no fewer than 70% of his passes in any of those contests. Beck's bounce-back year is a transfer portal success story that reconstructed his NFL Draft stock and may not be done just yet.\nOhio State vs. Miami prediction, pick\nOhio State has not allowed more than 16 points in a game all season. Miami has not surrendered more than 24 points in regulation. It would take an outlier performance from one or both teams for the over of 42.5 to hit. A look at how these teams have fared against elite competition reinforces that point. Miami is coming off a 10-3 win over a playoff team, and one of Ohio State's games against top-15 opponents was the only instance in which more than 36 total points were scored. The numbers back up what is evident on film: these are two dominant defenses built to thrive on the biggest stage. Pick: Under 42.5\n            ",

    "body": "\nA degree in rocket science is not required to conclude that earning the No. 5 seed in the NFC playoff bracket is more beneficial to being the No. 6 seed. But just how much more beneficial is it?The SportsLine Inside the Lines team and Projection Model have crunched the numbers, and the answer is significant.To review: The coveted No. 1 seed in the NFC will go to the winner of Saturday's showdown between the Seattle Seahawks (13-3) and San Francisco 49ers (12-4). The No. 2 seed will be either the NFC North champion Bears (11-5) or the NFC East champion Eagles (11-5), while the No. 3 seed will be the other. And the No. 4 seed will be the champion of the NFC South, either the Carolina Panthers (8-8) or Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-9).The intrigue begins with the No. 5 seed. Any of the Seahawks, 49ers or Rams (11-5) could end up in that spot. It's a nice consolation prize for not winning the NFC West and earning the No. 1 seed because the team with the No. 5 seed would play a wild card playoff game on the road against either the Panthers or Buccaneers. The alternative would be the No. 6 seed, which would mean a road game against either the Bears or Eagles.The Projection Model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, releases a weekly power rating, and in the latest version, Tampa Bay (17th) and Carolina (25th) are the two worst teams in the entire league still vying for a playoff berth. Meanwhile Philadelphia, the defending Super Bowl champion, remains No. 2 in the power ratings and would be a much more daunting opponent than the NFC South champion, according to the model.NFL rankTeamNeutral win%1Seahawks65.7%2Eagles63.8%3Rams63.6%5Packers61.7%949ers58.5%15Bears54.2%17Buccaneers49.4%25Panthers42.8%The SportsLine Inside the Lines team ran simulations on each of the three NFC West teams' chances to win the NFC and Super Bowl based on their possible seeding scenarios. According to the model, a team's chance to win the NFC and Super Bowl decreases by roughly 40% when dropping from the No. 5 seed to the No. 6 seed.SeahawksChance to win NFCChance to win Super BowlAs 1 seed39.7%22.5%As 5 seed (vs. Panthers)20.5%11.7%49ersChance to win NFCChance to win Super BowlAs 1 seed29.0%14.3%As 5 seed (vs. Panthers)11.0%5.4%As 6 seed6.4%3.1%RamsChance to win NFCChance to win Super BowlAs 5 seed (vs. Panthers)16.7%9.1%As 6 seed10.8%5.9%If the 49ers beat the Seahawks on Saturday to win the NFC West and No. 1 seed, then Seattle will be the No. 5 seed. However if the Seahawks win, then the No. 5 seed will go to the Rams (with a win over the Cardinals on Sunday) or San Francisco (with a Los Angeles loss or tie).  The Rams are a 7.5-point favorites over Arizona in the latest odds from DraftKings, but those odds could change drastically, especially if the 49ers win, locking Los Angeles into the No. 6 seed.\"At the end of the day, it's about us,\" Rams defensive lineman Kobie Turner said after Monday night's loss to the Falcons. \"Like I said before, I don't care where we go. I don't care who we have to play. I'm taking my guys and my team over anybody else.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        It wasn't easy to pick the Fantasy MVP for this season. We had several deserving candidates out of Christian McCaffrey, Bijan Robinson, Puka Nacua, Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Trey McBride, and you can make a strong case for all of them.When you factor in expectations and performance, the winner was McCaffrey. He had an amazing season as the No. 1 non-quarterback in 2025.He turned 29 in June, and his 2024 campaign was a nightmare when he was limited to just four games due to injury. While he was still a first-round pick based on his CBS Sports Average Draft Position at No. 8 overall, there was definitely some trepidation if McCaffrey could return to his previous form.McCaffrey shattered those concerns when he averaged 25.3 PPR points prior to Week 18, which is the third-best season of his career. Through 16 games, he had 303 carries for 1,179 yards and 10 touchdowns and 96 catches for 890 yards and seven touchdowns on 122 targets.\nHe was first in receptions among running backs and fifth in the NFL in catches, and he led all running backs in receiving yards and receiving touchdowns. His 17 total touchdowns were tied for second in the NFL, and he was second in total yards.There were only four games all season where McCaffrey failed to score at least 20 PPR points, and he did that while Brock Purdy, George Kittle, Jauan Jennings, Ricky Pearsall and Brandon Aiyuk all battled injuries. He carried the 49ers -- and Fantasy managers -- to a fantastic season.We'll see how McCaffrey finishes off this year with San Francisco headed to the NFL playoffs. And there will be plenty of debate about his Fantasy value in 2026 since he'll turn 30 and just had over 400 total touches.\nBut we can worry about that during the offseason. For now, let's celebrate McCaffrey as our Fantasy MVP.And he headlines our First-Team All Fantasy Team for 2025. We have three All Fantasy Teams, and you can see how great all of these players were this season.First TeamQB: Josh AllenRB: Christian McCaffreyRB: Bijan RobinsonWR: Puka NacuaWR: Jaxon Smith-NjigbaWR: Ja'Marr ChaseTE: Trey McBrideFLEX: Jonathan TaylorJoining McCaffrey on the first team were the other MVP candidates in Robinson, Nacua, Smith-Njigba and McBride. Picking the quarterback was tough because Allen (25.9 Fantasy points per game) just barely outscored Matthew Stafford (25.5) and Drake Maye (24.8).\nFor Allen, he did the most with the least amount of talent around him, and he led all quarterbacks in rushing yards (579) and rushing touchdowns (14). He also added 3,668 passing yards, 25 touchdowns and 10 interceptions, and he only had five games with fewer than 20 Fantasy points.Robinson led the NFL in total yards with 2,255, and he trailed only McCaffrey in receptions (76) and receiving yards (810). Robinson was also a monster in the Fantasy playoffs with 99.2 PPR points in Weeks 15-17, scoring at least 29.5 PPR points in each outing.Nacua led all receivers at 23.3 PPR points per game, and he was No. 1 in receptions (119), No. 2 in receiving yards (1,639) and tied for fifth in receiving touchdowns (nine). Nacua also had the third-best game of the season of any player in Week 16 with 46.5 PPR points at Seattle.\nSmith-Njigba was the No. 2 receiver this season at 21.6 PPR points per game, and he was No. 1 in receiving yards (1,709). He also added 113 receptions and 10 touchdowns, and he had a seven-game stretch during the season where he scored at least 20.3 PPR points.Chase was the Fantasy MVP in 2024 when he won the Triple Crown with the most receptions (127), receiving yards (1,708) and receiving touchdowns (14), and he averaged 23.7 PPR points per game. He had a down season by comparison so far with 117 catches, 1,316 yards and seven touchdowns at 19.3 PPR points per game, but he was still elite compared to most receivers.No one dominated their position like McBride, who scored 103.4 more PPR points than the No. 2 tight end. His 18.9 PPR points per game was also 3.5 PPR points better than the second tight end, and McBride was amazing once Jacoby Brissett took over at quarterback for the Cardinals in Week 6, averaging 21.8 PPR points per game during those 11 outings. His 119 catches also set the all-time NFL record for receptions by a tight end in a single season, breaking the mark of 116 set by Zach Ertz in 2018.  \nThe flex spot was a tough call between Taylor and Jahmyr Gibbs, but Taylor averaged more PPR points per game (22.3 to 21.7), which gave him the edge. Taylor also leads the NFL in rushing touchdowns (18) and total touchdowns (20), and he set a career high in receptions (44) and receiving yards (365). He also had a dominant game in Week 10 against Atlanta with 49.6 PPR points, which was the second-best outing of any player in 2025.Second TeamQB: Matthew StaffordRB: Jahmyr GibbsRB: De'Von AchaneWR: Amon-Ra St. BrownWR: George PickensWR: Chris OlaveTE: George KittleFLEX: James CookArguably the best surprise of 2025 was Stafford, who is an NFL MVP candidate and had the third season of his career with at least 25.5 Fantasy points -- and first since 2019. Through Week 17, Stafford was No. 2 in passing yards (4,448) and No. 1 in passing touchdowns (42), and he did this at 37 years old, which is remarkable.Gibbs was a lock for the first team before a disappointing finish when he scored 9.8 PPR points or less in two of his final three games. But he also had some dominant performances in 2025, including the best game of the season in Week 12 against the Giants with 55.4 PPR points. Gibbs finished third among running backs in receptions (74) and receiving yards (583), and he tied for second with 17 total touchdowns.\nAchane was one of five running backs (McCaffrey, Robinson, Taylor and Gibbs) to average at least 20 PPR points per game since he was at 20.2. Achane was fourth among running backs in receptions (67) and receiving yards (488), and he was No. 5 in rushing yards with 1,350.St. Brown just missed out on being a first-team member, but he was behind Nacua, Smith-Njigba and Chase in PPR points per game with 18.7. St. Brown still had his fourth season in a row with at least 100 receptions (106), and he scored double digits in touchdowns for the third year in a row (11). He also added 1,262 receiving yards.Pickens was the best offseason addition for any team from a Fantasy perspective when he averaged a career-best 18.1 PPR points per game. There were a lot of up-and-down performances for Pickens with seven games of at least 17.8 PPR points and five games with 12.2 PPR points or less, but he had 92 catches for 1,420 yards and nine touchdowns and was a steal at his ADP of 65.6.\nOlave was a bigger steal with his ADP of 102.8, and he had a breakout season at 16.8 PPR points per game. He had 100 catches for 1,163 yards and nine touchdowns, and he was Fantasy playoff hero with 83.2 PPR points in Weeks 15-17.Kittle missed six games due to hamstring and ankle injuries, but he was second among tight ends at 15.4 PPR points per game. Kittle had four games with at least 22.8 PPR points in his last six outings, and he remains a dominant force at his position despite turning 32 in October.Cook heads into Week 18 leading the NFL in rushing yards at 1,606. He also added 12 rushing touchdowns and 33 catches for 291 yards and two touchdowns. Among all non-quarterbacks, Cook was No. 9 at 18.8 PPR points per game.\nThird TeamQB: Drake MayeRB: Derrick HenryRB: Chase BrownWR: Davante AdamsWR: CeeDee LambWR: Michael WilsonTE: Kyle PittsFLEX: Rashee RiceMaye is a candidate for the NFL MVP, and he had a breakout Fantasy season in 2025. He was fourth in passing yards (4,203), tied for third in passing touchdowns (30) and sixth among quarterbacks in rushing yards (409). He also added four rushing touchdowns and had just eight interceptions.Henry had a quiet start to the season, but he scored at least 20.2 PPR points in four of his final seven games, including a combined 68.4 PPR points in his past two outings in Weeks 16 and 17. He scored 45.6 PPR points in the Fantasy championship against Green Bay, which is the fourth-best performance of any player this season.Brown only averaged 16.5 PPR points per game for the season, but he was a monster to close the year. He averaged 21.5 PPR points from Week 8 on, a span of nine games, and he had a combined 62 PPR points in Weeks 16 and 17 to help Fantasy managers in a big way in the playoffs.\nAdams missed Weeks 16 and 17 with a hamstring injury, but he still led all receivers with 14 touchdowns. That offset some of his other numbers with just 60 catches for 789 yards, but Adams only failed to score a touchdown in just four complete games this season.Lamb was overshadowed by Pickens this season, and Lamb missed three games due to a high-ankle sprain. But he still averaged 15.4 PPR points per game, including seven outings with at least 17.1 PPR points.Marvin Harrison missed four games this season and left early in another, and Wilson was the best receiver in Fantasy in those five outings. He averaged 25.8 PPR points over that span, and he was a must-start Fantasy receiver whenever Harrison was out.Pitts finished as the No. 2 tight end in total points, which was a huge achievement for the former Fantasy bust. He closed the season on a high note with at least 15 PPR points in four of his final five games, including 45.6 PPR points in Week 15 against Tampa Bay, which was the fifth-best performance of any player this season.Picking the flex for this team was tough, and there are several worthy candidates, including Drake London, Josh Jacobs, Kyren Williams and Travis Etienne. I went with Rice, who made a significant impact during the eight games he was active. After his six-game suspension ended and before he was placed on injured reserve with a concussion in Week 16, Rice averaged 18.8 PPR points per game, which was fourth-best among all receivers.\n            ",

Tuesday's victory over New Hampshire means the Cornhuskers have finished the non-league portion of their schedule undefeated for the first time since the 1928-29 season.

    "body": "\n        On paper, these quarterfinal matchups look terrific and better than what we got a year ago. There are storylines galore and a good mix of traditional blue bloods and programs that have smartly capitalized on college football's new era to ascend up the sport. Ahead of a fantastic slate that starts New Year's Eve with Ohio State vs. Miami in the Cotton Bowl, here's what you need to know ahead of the four College Football Playoff quarterfinal games. Battle of the trenches in DallasMiami didn't exactly wow anyone with its ugly 10-3 first-round win over Texas A&M. Carson Beck managed only 103 yards passing, and the Hurricanes' lone touchdown came with 1:44 left in the game. Surely, Ohio State will blow out this Miami team that was the final one to get into the playoff bracket, right?\nWell, the Buckeyes are indeed the biggest favorite of any of the four quarterfinal games (9.5-points). And, yes, outside of a hard-fought loss to No. 1 Indiana, Ohio State sailed through this season with ease behind a historically efficient quarterback in Julian Sayin and elite talent up and down the roster in Jeremiah Smith, Carnell Tate, Caleb Downs and many others. If, though, you were trying to make an argument to how Miami could win this game, it starts in the trenches. Miami has one of the best offensive lines in the country and the kind of elite defensive talent that can give opposing quarterbacks major headaches. Just ask Texas A&M's Marcel Reed, who was sacked seven times in the loss to Miami. A&M's running game didn't fare much better, totaling 89 yards and an anemic 2.5 yards per carry average. Ohio State has a better offensive line than Texas A&M but has shown it can be susceptible to defensive pressure. The Buckeyes gave up five sacks against Indiana and didn't do a good job of giving Sayin enough time in critical spots to get the ball out to where it needed to go. Against a star like Miami's Rueben Bain Jr., that can be a recipe for disaster. \nConversely, Miami will need its talented offensive line to give Beck as much time as possible to have any hope of succeeding against Matt Patricia's brilliant OSU defense. Indiana had enough success in the Big Ten title game, but it still wasn't easy. This will be the toughest defense Beck has faced all year. New Money vs. Newish MoneyOutside of Ohio State, there's a strong argument that Oregon and Texas Tech have best embraced what's possible in the NIL + revenue share era. Both have billionaire benefactors, both reside in locations that weren't traditional hotspots and both have been aggressive about putting together the best rosters that money can buy. Texas Tech has openly embraced that, unafraid to discuss how much it has spent on this year's roster. Oil billionaire Cody Campbell's grand plan for Texas Tech has paid off big time with the Red Raiders winning the Big 12, earning a first-round bye and now getting an Orange Bowl quarterfinal. For a program that averaged 7.66 wins over the last three seasons, this was only possible with an aggressive portal spending plan that saw the Red Raiders load up on players like David Bailey and Lee Hunter. \nOregon, especially coach Dan Lanning, has been a bit more defensive about the impact of NIL, offering barbs to opponents who have brought up Oregon's hefty payroll. But there's no question that Oregon, powered by Nike co-founder Phil Knight, has been creative and smart about a well-financed and well put together roster. A year ago, Oregon was the No. 1 overall seed but had a brutal path and lost to eventual champion Ohio State. This year, Oregon easily dispatched James Madison in Round 1 but faces a much tougher challenge in the quarterfinal.The matchup that should be very exciting to watch is Oregon's offense versus Texas Tech's defense. At Oregon, you have expensive transfers leading the way in quarterback Dante Moore, left guard Emmanuel Pregnon and leading rusher Noah Whittington and leading receiver Malik Benson. On the flip side, you'll see a defense full of new faces this season that have more than delivered on their hefty investment. Texas Tech went out and rebuilt its defensive front with Bailey, Hunter and Romello Height, and it paid off with one of the nation's top defenses. There are a lot of factors to watch with this one, but for two of the biggest spending teams, the Cotton Bowl result is another indicator of whether it was all worth it. \n\n        \n            \n                Boring by design and built to last: The beauty of Curt Cignetti's success at Indiana lies in its simplicity\n                \n                    Richard Johnson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nQB battle will decide Rose BowlThe last time Alabama played in the Rose Bowl, it marked the end of Nick Saban's sport-defining 17 seasons in Tuscaloosa. The Crimson Tide lost in heartbreaking fashion to Michigan, which set up a title game bout against … Kalen DeBoer's Washington Huskies. In just the two years since, we now have DeBoer leading the way at Alabama versus a Curt Cignetti-coached Indiana Hoosiers program that is the story of this decade. It's remarkable just how much has changed in that short period of time. There are storylines galore here with DeBoer and defensive coordinator Kane Wommack, both former Indiana assistants. Cignetti was a former Alabama assistant under Saban and won a national championship in 2009. Star Indiana defensive coordinator Bryant Haines was named after legendary former Alabama coach Bear Bryant.In this game, it'll likely come down to which quarterback fares better. Indiana, of course, has the Heisman Trophy winner in Fernando Mendoza. The Hoosiers have a better running game than Alabama, too, and will have Omar Cooper Jr. back after missing the Big Ten Championship Game against Ohio State. Mendoza has exceeded even the loftiest expectations when he transferred in from Cal. He has elevated both the Indiana program and his own draft stock and could be the first QB drafted in next year's NFL Draft. \nHere's something that caught my eye, though. In Indiana's three toughest games of the season so far (at Oregon, at Iowa, Ohio State), Mendoza went 48 of 77 for 670 yards with four touchdowns and three interceptions. Respectable numbers, but they don't blow you away. Now consider Alabama quarterback Ty Simpson's stats against the Tide's three toughest opponents (Georgia twice, Oklahoma twice and Vanderbilt): 112 of 179 for 1,386 yards, eight touchdowns and three interceptions. The completion percentages between the two are almost identical. Simpson has been a rollercoaster in Alabama's recent games. The Tide got blown out against Georgia and then found themselves down 17-0 against Oklahoma in the first round before they came roaring back. Simpson connected with Lotzeir Brooks for the freshman wide receiver's first two career touchdowns, and Alabama escaped Norman with a thrilling comeback win. \nCan Simpson deliver heroics once more? Indiana is too disciplined and too consistent to blow a 17-0 lead the way Oklahoma did. Alabama will need to be aggressive and creative from the jump, knowing that Indiana is going to prioritize taking away its passing game. The Hoosiers rate top five nationally in total defense, scoring defense and rushing defense. I saw in person how Indiana limited Ohio State's potent offense in the Big Ten Championship Game, and it'll be tough sledding for Alabama offensively in the Rose Bowl against Haines' brilliant defense. Indiana is rightfully a 7-point favorite in this one, but if 'Bama wins, we'll be talking about how Simpson fared better than the Heisman winner. \n        \n            \n                Trinidad Chambliss' future at Ole Miss is up in the air, but uncertainty has been a common theme along journey\n                \n                    Richard Johnson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nCan Ole Miss keep the magic alive?The dynamic is admittedly a bit weird. Amidst its best season in modern history, Ole Miss is led by a man who started the season as the defensive coordinator, almost its entire offensive staff is also working for a top rival, and its former head coach, Lane Kiffin, may attend the Sugar Bowl alongside the governor of Louisiana. After raiding Ole Miss' offensive staff, Kiffin is expected to also pursue a few Ole Miss players once the transfer portal opens up on Jan. 2. \nAnd yet, in spite of all that awkwardness, the Sugar Bowl presents a golden opportunity for new coach Pete Golding and these talented Rebels to prove they are capable of shutting out the noise and overcoming adversity. Ole Miss more than answered the test in a first round home game against Tulane. The offense looked as explosive as ever under offensive coordinator Charlie Weis Jr., and Golding deftly managed being a head coach and still calling the defensive plays. But this will be different against a Georgia team that delivered Ole Miss' lone loss of the 2025 season. Back in October, the two exchanged haymakers back-and-forth in a rollicking game inside Sanford Stadium that the Bulldogs eventually won 43-35. In that game, Georgia didn't have to punt the ball a single time, a source of frustration for Golding and his defensive staff. Can Ole Miss get redemption this time around? It'll be very challenging against a Georgia team that is peaking at the right time. The Bulldogs have won their last nine games, including convincing wins over Texas and Alabama in that stretch. You know Kirby Smart's defense will be ferocious and aggressive in trying to slow down Trinidad Chambliss and Kewan Lacy. \nBut maybe, just maybe, this Ole Miss team is different. A win over Georgia would send a message to everyone, including possibly the former head coach in attendance, that the Rebels are legitimate and won't be going away under Golding's leadership. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Nikola Jokić's hyperextended knee all but eliminated him from the MVP race. That would be true in any rational world. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was neck-and-neck with him already. If two players are reasonably close but one misses a month or more due to injury, the other would and should win. We really didn't need a rule to tell us that.And yet we have one. In 2023, the NBA instituted a 65-game minimum to qualify for major, end-of-season awards. While Jokić's injury almost certainly would have eliminated him from contention anyway, the fact that it's projected to take him essentially just beyond the eligibility threshold has drawn quite a bit of attention to a rule that doesn't really accomplish anything. History already tells us that players facing lengthy absences rarely win awards.Only five players have ever won MVPs having played fewer than 65 games. Four of them did so in seasons that included less than 82 games: 1999 Karl Malone played 49 out of 50 games, 2012 LeBron James played 62 out of 66, 2020 Giannis Antetokounmpo played 63 out 73 and 1958 Bob Cousy played 64 out of 72. The only true MVP that wouldn't have qualified for the 65-game rule was Bill Walton in 1978. He won playing 58 games. On the night he got hurt, his Portland Trail Blazers were 50-10 and among the greatest regular-season teams of all time to that point. He was a reasonable exception to a rule we assumed voters could be trusted to leave unspoken. Rudy Gobert winning Defensive Player of the Year with 56 games played in 2018 is a tad suspect, but that award has otherwise been reasonably unaffected. True, Kawhi Leonard and Jaren Jackson both won below 65 games, but neither did so egregiously. Leonard played 64 in 2015, including the last 41 straight. Jackson played 63, and it would have been 64 if Memphis had needed him for the season finale. Brandon Roy and Patrick Ewing are the only Rookie of the Year winners below 65 games in an 82-game season, so again, uncommon.\nThere's one, specific area in which this 65-game minimum actually does matter: All-NBA. The 2011-12 season was shortened due to a lockout. We had nine 82-game seasons after that before the 65-game minimum was instituted. During that stretch, 135 total All-NBA slots were awarded. Of those 135 slots, 18, or a bit more than 13%, went to players who played in less than 65 games. Notably, half of those All-NBA nods were awarded in the last two seasons before the change. Four came in the 2021-22 season and five came in the 2022-23 season. A year after that, the minimum was instituted.There are some pretty notable points about the window we just covered. The 2012-13 season broadly aligns with the introduction of \"load management\" as a term in the NBA zeitgeist. The concept was first widely debated when Gregg Popovich sent four starters home before a November 2012 game against the Miami Heat that was nationally televised for the sake of rest. Ostensibly, the 65-game rule was a measure taken to limit load management. In theory, the NBA wanted a deterrent against players missing games due to rest.There was also some genuine evidence suggesting that voters were awarding injured or resting players more often than they had in the past. Look at the window between the 1999 lockout and 2011 lockout. We played 12 82-games seasons in that time, meaning a total of 180 All-NBA slots were handed out. Of those 180, only seven, or just under 4%, went to players who suited up less than 65 times.\nBut there's another important element of timing here. The NBA's last national media rights deal ended after the 2024-25 season. They were negotiating its replacement in the years leading up to then, most notably during the 2023-24 season. Hmm... what changed during the 2023-24 season? The adoption of the 65-game rule. And what happened in the seasons prior? Nine out of a possible 30 All-NBA slots went to player who frequently missed time.It's not hard to connect the dots here. The logical motivation for the 65-game rule had nothing to do with preserving the sanctity of awards races. It was a shot at the narrative of load management, an effort to assure possible new television partners that if it bought into the league, it could expect the best players in the sport to actually suit up for the games it aired. If you're paying to broadcast LeBron James games, you want to feel reasonably assured that LeBron James is actually playing in them.But here's the thing about LeBron James: he's old. So are a lot of the players making All-NBA with fewer than 65 games played. Of those 18 players to earn All-NBA honors in that 2013-to-2023 window, the average age was just a hair under 30 years old. That average was dragged down by two appearances by Joel Embiid in his age-23 and -24 seasons and Kawhi Leonard in his age-27 season. Both of them have dealt with degenerative medical issues they've never truly recovered from. Ja Morant, who made this list in his age-22 season, has dealt with his fair share of injuries as well. In other words, this list is essentially comprised of old players and injury-prone players.\nAnd you know what happened to old players and injury-prone players in the past? They mostly just declined. Medical science is better today than it used to be. There's a world in which players like Embiid and Leonard get hurt in their early 20s and never recover well enough to play at an All-NBA level. They both did. Rest was at least a part of what made that possible. There have been 15 All-NBA seasons from players 36 and older in league history. Only three of them came in the 20th century. LeBron James alone has four. Expand our range out to 35 year olds. We've seen 30 All-NBA seasons out of players in their age-35 or later season. Almost half of them, 14, have come in the load management era. So... has there been some epidemic of injury-prone players making All-NBA Teams? Or are old guys just maintaining their production longer than they used to, allowing voters to acknowledge what most of us would consider the truth: even a fading, occasionally resting LeBron James or Stephen Curry is probably more valuable than a younger player who's available more often?Players like that aren't going to be swayed by another All-NBA nod. Frankly, James has probably lost track of how many of those he's earned (the answer is 21, by the way, as James has been an All-NBA player in more than half of the years he's been on this Earth). He's going to focus on doing whatever it takes to keep his body in the best possible condition to extend his career and ensure his availability when the stakes get higher in the spring. The same is true for injury-prone players. You're not going to bully Kawhi Leonard into playing when he doesn't think he should.But you know who is swayed by All-NBA eligibility? Younger players. Why? It's not the honor of the award. It's the money that comes with it. The NBA somehow doesn't trust its award voters enough not to pick injured players, but does trust them enough to let them determine how much money its players can earn. When a player is chosen for All-NBA in the season before his contract expires or in two of the previous three seasons, he becomes eligible for a higher max salary. Players with less than six years of experience get bumped up from 25% of the cap in the first year of their deal to 30% thanks to the Derrick Rose Rule. Players with between seven and nine years of experience go from 30% to 35% due to the designated veteran rule, colloquially known as the \"supermax.\" There are other ways of earning this eligibility but, as MVP and Defensive Player of the Year usually aligns with All-NBA anyway, players know this is generally the target to shoot for in order to get those higher max contracts. But sometimes, chasing that money can do real harm to a player and his team.\nTake Tyrese Haliburton. He played in 33 of Indiana's first 36 games in the 2023-24 season. In that time, he was a genuine MVP candidate averaging just under 24 points and 13 assists on nearly 50-40-90 shooting. And then he hurt his hamstring. He missed five games, returned for one, then missed five more. He didn't miss another game the rest of the season, eking out All-NBA eligibility with 69 games played. He also wasn't the same player, averaging 16.8 points and 9.3 assists on far less efficient shooting than he had before the injury.He was so good in the first half of the season that he still managed to sneak his way in as a Third-Team All-NBA selection, and he therefore got a 30% max contract. But it certainly seemed like he rushed back before he was ready. Haliburton himself essentially admitted that. In an interview with former podcaster JJ Redick in which Redick alluded to Haliburton's \"$53 million incentive to come back,\" Indiana's star guard acknowledged he might have handled his recovery differently without the 65-game rule. \"I thought I was ready to go for the Portland game. So did our medical staff. Everybody agreed,\" he said. \"But if this was never the case, I might have been like, 'Give it another game or two. Maybe think more through this. Let's try to be 100%.'\"\nWell, that injury seemingly bothered him even beyond that extension. He started slow last season before heating up as the season progressed and having a stellar postseason. The calf injury that would later snowball into a torn Achilles was unrelated, but the hamstring injury seemingly affected two separate seasons for him and the Pacers. Some injuries just tend to linger and many have the potential to get far worse if a player rushes back from them too quickly. Do we really want to incentivize them to do so? This is as much a critique of All-NBA voting affecting salaries as the 65-game rule, but they're related in this case. Players now have a direct target to shoot for.And conversely, the bar has been lowered for players who never get hurt at all. The All-NBA system is designed, at least in theory, to reward the 15 best players in a given season. Generally speaking, the 15 best players in the league at a given time are the sort of players teams feel comfortable giving giant contracts to, though no two sets of circumstances are identical. But let's say the 65-game rule knocks a big chunk of the top 15 out of the running in a given season. That is happening as we speak. Jokić likely won't play 65 games. Neither will Victor Wembanyama or Giannis Antetokounmpo. Luka Dončić isn't in the danger zone yet, but given the minor injuries he so often accumulates, the seven games he's missed already gives him little cushion. More injuries will inevitably come. We're not even halfway through the season.Suddenly, it's not the 15 best players making All-NBA. It's 15 of the best 19. Or 15 of the best 22. Or 15 of the best 26. Eventually, inevitably, players not typically worthy of All-NBA honors are going to make All-NBA Teams, and that could create problems in a number of directions. Obviously, there's the risk of a team actually paying a player supermax money who doesn't deserve it and hurting themselves in the long run because of it, but there's also the chance that an eligible player asks for money he probably shouldn't get, is denied, and it affects his relationship with the team. No player will enjoy hearing that they don't deserve a supermax contract. At least without a 65-game minimum, better players will make the cut and teams would have some cover. \"We'd love to offer you the supermax, but darn, you're not eligible, oh well.\"\nThere's a contingent of terminally online basketball fans right now whining that the 65-game rule has only become a talking point because Jokić, specifically, has missed out on a chance to win his fourth MVP. But this has nothing to do with him. Not really, anyway. Rule or no, his injury handed Shai Gilgeous-Alexander the MVP trophy on a silver platter. We start to run into problems if Gilgeous-Alexander winds up getting hurt because of all of those other injuries we just mentioned, but for now, the 65-game rule really isn't likely to swing the MVP race. It almost never does. This was never about trophies.It's about money. And maybe that's what it takes for the NBA to admit this was a bad rule and repeal it. The new TV deal has been secured. Maybe a few bad supermax contracts will spring out of this change and coax a few aggrieved owners into action. Sure, it'd be nice if voters could be trusted to make their own determinations on injuries within the context of a given season. NBA history matters to the fans. But money is what matters to the stakeholders and this rule has far greater financial implications than most seem eager to admit. Money seemingly created this rule, so that might be what it takes to destroy it.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The College Football Playoff quarterfinal matchups have been set for 10 days, which has given sports bettors ample time to dig in and try to find edges for each of the four games. Despite some intriguing matchups in terms of program names, only one of the four quarterfinal games opened with a spread inside a touchdown -- No. 5 Oregon was made a 1.5-point favorite over No. 4 Texas Tech in the Orange Bowl. The other top three seeds were all made 6.5-point favorites or more. No. 2 Ohio State as the biggest favorite of the round, laying 9.5 points against No. 10 Miami to open in the Cotton Bowl. No. 1 Indiana opened as a 6.5-point favorite over No. 9 Alabama, while No. 3 Georgia was also made a 6.5-point favorite against No. 6 Ole Miss. After 10 days of betting action, not too much has changed on the odds sheet as oddsmakers had their power ratings dialed for the quarterfinal showdowns and have gotten fairly even action to hold the numbers close to where they began. (Odds below via FanDuel Sportsbook) College Football Playoff quarterfinal line movementBowlOpening spread, totalCurrent spread, total (12/31)Cotton BowlOhio State -9.5, 41.5Ohio State -9.5, 41.5Orange BowlOregon -1.5, 52.5Oregon -2.5, 51.5Rose BowlIndiana -6.5, 48.5Indiana -7.5, 48.5Sugar BowlGeorgia -6.5, 56.5Georgia -6.5, 55.5The most notable movement is Indiana moving across a key number from being a 6.5-point favorite to a 7.5-point favorite. While Oregon moved from laying 1.5 to 2.5, indicating more money coming in on the Ducks, it takes far more for oddsmakers to be willing to shift a line across that all-important number of 7. \nBettors are big enough believers in the undefeated Hoosiers against an Alabama team that's been up and down of late that the oddsmakers have had to push Indiana to the other side of a touchdown. That's still a staggering number to look at next to those two logos, but Indiana has more than earned that respect from the oddsmakers and bettors with their performance in bit games this season. Ohio State and Georgia have largely stayed static, with the occasional bump to 10 and 7 before shifting back, but not enough has come in heavy enough on Miami or Ole Miss to move those lines closer to the underdogs than the opening numbers. We've also seen a pair of totals drop a point, with the Oregon-Texas Tech number dipping to 51.5, while Georgia-Ole Miss has slid to 55.5 -- again moving through a key number of 56 to indicate some strong early money on the under. The other two totals have remained static, as the oddsmakers are happy with the balance on the action. Odds movement can offer an indication of where the \"wise guys\" stand on games, and the minimal movement on the quarterfinals points to the oddsmakers and sharps largely being in alignment on the numbers. That's not a surprise given the profile of the eight teams remaining and how deep into the season we are, as the major edges usually come earlier in the year or with lesser known teams. \nOn paper, they all seem to agree, and on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day, we'll find out if the games on the field play out as expected or if the numbers are made to look foolish. \n            ",

Arizona also lost its leading scorer from last season to the NBA. These two teams are challenging each other on opening night on a neutral floor, and defense can come together quicker than offense for some units filled with new faces, and that's what the model projects for Monday from T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. The model projects the Under to hit in 60.8% of simulations. Back the Under at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Cowboys vs. Cardinals: Over 53.5 total points (-115)This Monday Night Football matchup has the highest over/under of any game on the Week 9 NFL schedule, and the Dallas Cowboys are the main reason for that on both sides of the ball. Dallas entered the week with the second-best scoring offense at 30.8 points per game. That alone is great news for an Over bet, but it doesn't end there. On the opposite side of the ball, the Cowboys have the second-worst scoring defense at 31.3 ppg allowed, which has resulted in the Over hitting in five straight Dallas games. The Cardinals are starting Jacoby Brissett at quarterback with Kyler Murray (foot) still out, and Arizona's offense has been more efficient without Murray. The Cardinals are averaging 25 ppg in Brissett's two starts, compared to 20.6 ppg with Murray. The model projects the Over to hit in 53% of simulations. Back the Over at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Rockets (-12.5) vs. Mavericks (-110)The Rockets have won three straight games after dropping their first two games of the season, with all three wins coming by at least 18 points. Houston has won by an average of 24.3 ppg over this winning streak, so a 12.5-point margin certainly isn't too daunting. The Rockets are averaging 134.7 points with at least 128 points in each game during this run, with Kevin Durant leading the charge at 27.2 ppg. Alperen Sengun is averaging 22.2 points, 8.4 rebounds and 7.6 assists per game this season, while Jabari Smith Jr. and Amen Thompson are adding 15 ppg each.

    "body": "\n        NFC squads looking to crawl their way back into the postseason picture will meet in Week 9 of 'Monday Night Football' when the Dallas Cowboys host the Arizona Cardinals. Dallas (3-4-1) is undefeated at home but enters off a 44-24 defeat at Denver last Sunday. Arizona (2-5) has the NFL's longest losing streak at five games and fell to Green Bay, 27-23, in Week 7 before having a bye last week. Jacoby Brissett will remain the starting quarterback for Arizona in place of the still recovering Kyler Murray (foot), according to coach Jonathan Gannon. Though he won't start, Murray is questionable to be active as a backup. Defensive lineman Walter Nolen III (calf) and cornerback Will Johnson (groin) are also questionable for Arizona. Dallas center Cooper Beebe (ankle) has been activated off of injured reserve and is expected to play. Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. Dallas is the 3.5-point favorite in the latest Cardinals vs. Cowboys odds, while the over/under for total points scored is 53.5.

The Cards have won both three straight overall against the Cowboys as well as each of their last three trips to Dallas. Arizona's spread record has mirrored its outright record in these eight contests as the Cardinals have covered in seven of the eight. Despite a five-game losing streak this season, Arizona has covered in back-to-back contests, while Dallas is coming off both a straight-up and spread defeat.The Cardinals can take advantage of Dallas' porous defense on Monday as the Cowboys rank second-worst in points allowed, yards allowed and passing defense. Dallas is dead last in third-down defense, which plays into Arizona's strength as the latter ranks fifth in third-down offense. Plus, having Brissett under center isn't much of a downgrade for the team as the journeyman has back-to-back games with two touchdown passes against a pair of one-loss teams in Green Bay and Indianapolis, so he should find success versus the Cowboys. See which team to back at SportsLine.New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states:Why the Cowboys can coverFew teams can match the offensive firepower of Dallas, which leads the NFL in passing offense, ranks second in points scored and is also second in total yards gained. Dak Prescott leads the league in QBR while running back, Javonte Williams, ranks among the top four in both rushing yards and rushing touchdowns. George Pickens is third in both receiving yards and receiving touchdowns, while No. 1 wideout, CeeDee Lamb, has 184 yards and a score in his two games since returning from injury.While Arizona coming off a bye would seemingly help its chances of winning, it may not help its chances of covering. The Cardinals have lost each of their last three games versus the spread after a bye, and they are 2-5 ATS with a rest advantage since 2022. Meanwhile, the Cowboys have a knack for rising to the occasion when an opponent has an advantageous schedule. Dallas is 6-2 ATS when at a rest disadvantage since the start of the 2022 season. See which team to back at SportsLine. Check out the latest BetMGM promo code CBSSPORTS, where new users can get up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses.How to make Cowboys vs. Cardinals picksFor Cardinals vs. Cowboys   on 'Monday Night Football,' the model is leaning Over the total, projecting 56 combined points.

Most Valuable Promotions announced that the Nov. 14 boxing event headlined by Jake Paul vs. Gervonta \"Tank\" Davis had been canceled. The news comes after the latest domestic violence allegation against Davis, with a civil lawsuit filed in Miami-Dade County in late October.The lawsuit is the latest in a line of domestic violence allegations for Davis, the most recent of which stemmed from a incident wherein Davis allegedly struck his ex-girlfriend, and mother of his children, in the head during a dispute on Father's Day. Davis was arrested in July, but charges were dropped in August when the alleged victim declined to prosecute. The new lawsuit by an ex-girlfriend alleges battery and kidnapping in their relationship.After news of the lawsuit broke, MVP released a statement that they were investigating the situation. It was immediately believed Davis would be pulled from the event.\nRumors of potential replacement opponents have swirled since, including former UFC fighter and Paul opponent Nate Diaz, former UFC heavyweight champion Francis Ngannou, and popular boxers Ryan Garcia and Terence Crawford.MVP's statement Monday night claimed that Paul will still headline a Netflix card before the end of 2025.\n\"Our team has worked closely with all parties to navigate this situation responsibly,\" Nakisa Bidarian, CEO of Most Valuable Promotions, said. \"While we will not be moving forward with this event, our plan still remains for Jake Paul to headline an event on Netflix in 2025. Details regarding a new date, location, Jake's opponent, and additional bouts will be shared as soon as they are finalized. We thank Netflix, the Kaseya Center, and the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino for their partnership.\"\n            \n    ",

Weiss replaces the retiring Brian Snitker in the Braves' dugout. Weiss, 61, spent parts of 14 seasons in the majors, playing for the A's, Marlins, Rockies and concluding with three seasons for the Braves. He was part of the pennant-winning 1999 Braves, hitting .286 in the NLCS. Previously, Weiss managed the Rockies from 2013-16, going 283-365 and failing to make the playoffs. He's spent the past eight seasons as the Braves' bench coach, which is the MLB version of a top assistant, second-in-command.\nThe Braves have had a really nice run of success with Snitker and Weiss. Snitker took over as interim manager in 2016 after the dismissal of Fredi Gonzalez and impressed the higher-ups enough to keep the job on a full-time basis. Weiss joined as Snitker's No. 2 in 2018. Starting that season, the Braves had a run of six consecutive NL East titles and then a wild-card berth after that. They won more than 100 games twice and won the 2021 World Series. Obviously, Snitker was the boss there, but Weiss had to have had some hand in the managing of the team and there's something to be said for continuity in the dugout. Weiss was originally selected by the Athletics in the first round out of North Carolina in the 1985 Draft. He won American League Rookie of the year for the pennant-winning A's in 1988 and was their starting shortstop for the 1989 World Series championship and then again the following year for the third straight AL pennant. He made the All-Star team for the Braves in 1998. \nIt's been a busy managerial carousel since the end of the regular season. Nine teams have been searching for their next manager and so far we've seen seven teams fill their vacancy. The Rockies and Padres are still looking for their next manager. \n            \n    ",

Left tackle Joe Alt suffered a right high ankle sprain, his second such injury this season, and the team announced Monday that Alt will undergo season-ending surgery to help stabilize the ankle.Alt missed three games earlier this season after suffering the same injury in Week 4, though a longer absence could be in store this time with a Monday MRI set to reveal an official strategy moving forward.Alt's presence -- or lack thereof -- protecting quarterback  Justin Herbert's blindside has been absolutely crucial for the Chargers this season.Chargers in 2025Joe Alt on the fieldJoe Alt off the fieldExpected points added per play0.10-0.03Net yards per attempt7.86.0Pressure rate43.5%38.4%The Chargers are 5-1 when Alt plays and 1-2 when he does not. Los Angeles has operated like one of the NFL's top five offenses when Alt is on the field, only to degrade to playing about as well as the Panthers -- the No. 22 offense in EPA per play -- when he is sidelined.Alt is playing left tackle because Rashawn Slater tore his patellar tendon in the preseason, shortly after becoming the highest-paid offensive lineman in NFL history.\nAustin Deculus, who previously started in Alt's place, suffered an ankle injury in Week 7 and was inactive this week despite not carrying an injury designation. Starting guard Mekhi Becton (hand) was also inactive, and right tackle Bobby Hart left with groin and ankle injuries.On Los Angeles' final offensive drive, the offensive line was, from left to right, Jamaree Salyer, Zion Johnson, Bradley Bozeman, Foster Sarell and Trey Pipkins. It was the first time this season Salyer played left tackle and Sarell's first start at right guard. Pipkins hadn't started since Week 6.Alt's absence could be the straw that breaks the camel's back. Herbert has taken 28 sacks this season, third-most in the NFL, and he has been contacted 80 times, most in the NFL.\nSunday, against a struggling Titans defense, Herbert was contacted 10 times. With the running backs struggling, he was the team's leading rusher with 57 yards and a touchdown.\n            ",

Jones, a long-time executive in their finance department, allegedly embezzled $3.8 million in team funds through fraudulent purchases he got authorized on the franchise's business credit cards. In his position, Jones had control over the team's American Express account and issued himself multiple corporate cards. Federal prosecutors allege he used those cards to purchase trips, cars, concert tickets, gifts and more. Jones allegedly paid for numerous trips to destinations like the Bahamas, Thailand, Switzerland and more, and also bought a Porsche with team funds. Jones allegedly altered documents and bills to make them seem like they were for legitimate organizational purposes and then sent them to the team's accounting department for approval. The Athletic cites an example of Jones getting a $229,968.76 bill paid for by the team for what he claimed was the franchise's stay at the Wynn in Las Vegas during their run to the semifinals of the NBA Cup. However, that amount was to pay for personal spending, according to federal prosecutors, and Jones altered an email from American Express to show the charges were from the Wynn. \nJones is no longer employed by the Hawks. \n            \n    ",

Jones, who was in his first year with Tennessee, also has 26 total tackles and a fumble recovery this season.\n\n        \n            \n                2025 NFL Trade Deadline Tracker: Live updates and analysis as Ravens, Eagles bolster pass rush\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThis is Baltimore's second trade this season. At the beginning of October, the Ravens acquired safety Alohi Gilman from the Chargers in exchange for pass rusher Odafe Oweh. Acquiring Gilman has allowed the Ravens to play three safeties at a time -- Gilman, Kyle Hamilton and Malaki Starks -- and fueled major defensive improvement. In three games with Gilman, the Ravens are allowing 13 points per game. In the five games prior to the trade, they had allowed 35.4 points per game.Still, the pass rush was a major issue. The Ravens' 11 sacks this season are tied for second-fewest in the NFL, and their 27.3% pressure rate is the third-lowest. Nnamdi Madubuike -- who has not played since Week 2 and is out for the season with a neck injury -- and Tavius Robinson, who has not played since Week 6 due to a broken foot, are still tied for the team lead with two sacks.\nLamar Jackson's return and the defense's improvement have helped Baltimore win two straight after a 1-5 start. The 1-8 Titans, meanwhile, are seen as a likely sellers at the deadline, and Jones is the first move in that regard.\n            \n    ",

It marked Luvu's third hip-drop tackle of the season.The hip-drop tackle was outlawed by the NFL prior to the 2024 season. Here's how the league defines the now-illegal play:\"It is a foul if a player uses the following technique to bring a runner to the ground: (a) grabs the runner with both hands or wraps the runner with both arms; and (b) unweights himself by swiveling and dropping his hips and/or lower body, landing on and trapping the runner's leg(s) at or below the knee.\"\nWhile the hip-drop tackle is technically supposed to be a 15-yard penalty, officials are not quick to throw the flag on these plays. We've seen several hip-drop tackles go unpenalized on Sundays, but then fined after the fact. That has been the case with Luvu's infractions as well. \nIn nine games this season, Luvu has recorded 50 tackles, two sacks, two passes defensed and three quarterback hits. With Luvu out for Week 10, it could be Jordan Magee that takes his place in the starting lineup next to the veteran Bobby Wagner.\nSunday was brutal for the Commanders. Not only did Washington fall to 3-6 and lose Luvu for one game, but quarterback Jayden Daniels suffered a dislocated left elbow, wide receiver and kick returner Luke McCaffrey suffered a broken collarbone and cornerback Marshon Lattimore tore his ACL.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Asante Samuel Jr. has been cleared for football activities after undergoing spinal fusion surgery in April. The former Chargers cornerback has already been in touch with several teams and is planning to make free-agency visits as soon as this week, per ESPN.A 2021 second-round pick, Samuel played in just four games last season after experiencing what he described as a stinger in both shoulders. Dr. David Okonkwo, a neurosurgeon for the Steelers, performed Samuel's surgery.Samuel, 26, had two interceptions in each of his first three seasons with the Chargers. In the 2022 AFC wild-card round, Samuel had three interceptions and six pass breakups during Los Angeles' loss to the Jaguars.Samuel's comeback attempt coincides with Tuesday's trade deadline. Given his status as a free agent, Samuel will likely attract attention from teams who could use help at cornerback but would prefer not to give up capital in order to get one.\nWhere will Samuel end up? Here's a rundown of some of his possible landing spots.\n        \n            \n                2025 NFL Trade Deadline Tracker: Live updates and analysis as Ravens, Eagles bolster pass rush\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSteelers Pittsburgh could use some reinforcements at cornerback given its injuries in the secondary this season. The Steelers' need at cornerback was recently elevated with Jalen Ramsey moving to free safety to replace DeShon Elliott, who recently went on injured reserve. In this scenario, Samuel would work alongside Joey Porter Jr. (who had an interception in Pittsburgh's Week 9 win over the Colts), emerging backup Brandin Echols and former Pro Bowler Darius Slay, who has struggled during his first season with the Steelers. \nBengals Cincinnati is a given considering how bad its defense has been this season. The Bengals' secondary has been especially bad this season; Cincinnati has allowed the most passing yards and touchdown passes through nine games. A big reason for the Bengals' secondary woes has been Cam Taylor-Britt's demotion under first-year defensive coordinator Al Golden. 49ers While they're off to a surprising 6-3 start, San Francisco could use some reinforcements in the secondary if it is going to make a legitimate run at a Super Bowl. The 49ers are currently 20th in the NFL in pass defense, 17th in touchdown passes allowed and 30th in interceptions. San Francisco will need to improve in these areas if it is going to upstage Seattle (and its high-octane passing attack) in the NFC West. Eagles On paper, the defending champs would be an ideal spot for Samuel. In this scenario, he would likely be asked to provide depth to an already established unit. Samuel could especially come in handy on third down, as the Eagles' defense is just 26th in the league in that area. \nRavens Winners of two straight games, the Ravens are still hoping to grab one of the AFC's seven playoff spots two months from now. Adding some depth to their defense may go a long way in helping John Harbaugh's team accomplish that goal. Baltimore's defense has made strides in recent weeks, but is still one of the NFL's worst units against the pass. Cowboys Dallas owner and general manager Jerry Jones hasn't been shy about his willingness to make moves before the trade deadline. Given the Cowboys' issues on defense (and specifically in the secondary) this season, it would make sense for them to at least look into signing Samuel. Dallas' defensive challenges this season include cornerback Trevon Diggs being placed on injured reserve in October. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Dylan Harper was off to a strong start to his NBA career, as he helped the Spurs to a 5-0 record by hitting the ground running alongside Victor Wembanyama in San Antonio. With De'Aaron Fox out to start the season, Harper got a chance to show what he can do as the Spurs' lead guard and averaged 14.0 points, 4.0 rebounds and 3.8 assists per game on 50/35.7/83.3 shooting splits. That was until he exited a loss to the Suns after just 11 minutes of play with a calf strain that Shams Charania reported on Monday will cost him \"multiple weeks\" of action. The positive for Harper and the Spurs is that it isn't a more severe injury, but they'll now need to proceed cautiously with their young budding star as a calf strain tends to require management for some time even after a player returns to the court. That, along with Fox's impending return to the starting lineup, will likely move Harper to the periphery of the NBA's Rookie of the Year race. That now appears set to be a two-man battle between Dallas' Cooper Flagg and Philadelphia's V.J. Edgecombe. At FanDuel Sportsbook, Flagg is now a -110 favorite with Edgecombe close behind at +130, with no one else inside +2000. (Harper fell to +4000 due to his injury.) \nEdgecombe being second is a bit surprising in a vacuum, as he has been the unquestionable best rookie in the first two weeks of the season. Edgecombe is averaging 20.3 points, 5.0 assists and 5.0 rebounds per game on 49.5/42.1/82.4 splits and has created an electric Sixers backcourt with Tyrese Maxey. He produces highlight reel plays seemingly every night and has quickly made himself a household name not only in Philadelphia, but for NBA fans around the country. The question is whether he can keep up the red-hot shooting start (he shot 34% from three at Baylor) and how his role will change whenever Paul George returns to action. Nick Nurse will have to find the right balance between working back in one of his presumptive top stars without messing with the great chemistry Maxey and Edgecombe have created just two weeks in the season. Flagg being the heavy favorite for the award coming into the season means oddsmakers are wary of moving him out of the top spot in ROY odds this early in the season despite Edgecombe clearly leaping him in on-court production. The No. 1 overall pick has been thrust into an ill-fitting point guard role in Dallas and asked to sink or swim by Jason Kidd. The goal is to make him a better, more confident playmaker with the ball in his hands long-term, but in the immediate he has struggled as expected with such a hefty on-ball workload. \nFlagg is averaging 13.8 points, 6.5 rebounds and 3.0 assists per game on 37.3/28.6/100.0 splits in Dallas, as he's struggled with efficiency while being tasked with creating most of his own offense. There are plenty of reasons for optimism that Flagg will be producing at the level he was expected to by the time this season ends. His lone season at Duke showed that he is more than capable of shaking off a slow start and dominating once he gets comfortable. On top of that, at some point, Flagg should cede the point guard role back to Kyrie Irving, which should help his shooting numbers. With so much of the season left in front of him, there's plenty of time for him to put up the kind of stats to pull closer to Edgecombe. The battle between those two for Rookie of the Year will be exciting to watch all season. At some point in the not too distant future Harper will be back on the court and will throw his hat in the ring for All-Rookie team honors in what has proven early on to be a quality rookie class, but his injury and the role question when Fox is back in the rotation make it hard to see a path to ROY. Spurs fans will be less worried about that and more excited about the prospects of what the team can look like whenever he and Fox are healthy given the Spurs have thrust themselves into the playoff conversation out West with their hot start. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NFL season is roughly halfway complete and that means it is time to reassess the Offensive and Defensive Rookie of the Year races. The offensive picture has not changed much since the quarter mark, but the defensive odds have shifted a bit as a result of no one running away with the award. Speaking to the draft class as a whole, there has been incredible depth. Sixty rookies have played at least 250 offensive or defensive snaps this season. That figure more than doubles when expanded to include 100+ snaps. The Browns, for example, have eight rookies who have played at least 100 offensive and/or defensive snaps. Here are my five favorites for both Offensive and Defensive Rookie of the Year awards, as well as a sleeper for each. Odds are from DraftKings Sportsbook as of Monday afternoon. New users are eligible for up to $200 in bonus bets.Offensive Rookie of the YearQB Jaxson Dart, Giants (-130)WR Emeka Egbuka, Buccaneers (+175)TE Tyler Warren, Colts (+650)WR Tetairoa McMillan, Panthers (+1400)RB Quinshon Judkins, Browns (+2200)Over the past 10 years, Offensive Rookie of the Year has been awarded to five quarterbacks, three running backs and two wide receivers. Quarterbacks have won four of the past six seasons. A tight end has never won the award, which means Warren's odds are a bit ominous. He is aided by the Colts performing so well as a team. \nThe top two from the quarter mark are now flipped as Dart has become more entrenched and productive as the Giants starting quarterback. If Dart doesn't veer off course, he's a pretty clear choice for Offensive Rookie of the Year. Egbuka has cooled off a bit over the last three weeks and has been dealing with an injury. He is leading all rookies in receiving yards (562) and receiving touchdowns (5). McMillan has been a key component of Carolina's offense. The Panthers are performing better as a team, but McMillan may not produce a season-long stat line strong enough to overcome Dart. He is leading all rookies with 69 targets. \nThe fifth spot came down to Raiders running back Ashton Jeanty (+1800) and Judkins. Judkins has been more productive in a smaller sample size, but the margins are slim. Titans quarterback Cam Ward, the No. 1 overall pick, was a consideration, but it was difficult to envision his supporting cast improving enough to rejoin the conversation. Sleeper: TE Oronde Gadsden, Chargers (+2500)Gadsden has not played as much as the others on this list, but no rookie has been more productive over the past month. He is averaging 94.25 yards receiving per game over that time period. If he continues on that path, +2500 will be good value. \n        \n            \n                Wilson's 2026 NFL mock draft: Cowboys land two playmakers to rebuild broken defense; Jaxson Dart gets top-5 WR\n                \n                    Ryan Wilson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDefensive Rookie of the YearEDGE Abdul Carter, Giants (+135)LB Jihaad Campbell, Eagles (+250)S Nick Emmanwori, Seahawks (+250)EDGE Donovan Ezeiruaku, Cowboys (+2800)CB Will Johnson, Cardinals (+3000)Over the past 10 years, six pass rushers, three cornerbacks and one linebacker have won the award. Pass rushers have won five of the past six awards. Those players averaged 8.2 sacks as rookies. Most recently, Jared Verse won the award with 4.5 sacks. Shaq Leonard (2018) is the last pure linebacker to win the award since Luke Kuechly in 2012. Leonard stuffed the stat sheet with 163 total tackles, seven sacks, four forced fumbles, two fumble recoveries and two interceptions.   \nCarter has been effective creating pressure for the Giants, but Brian Burns has had a monopoly on the sack production (11). No one else on the team has more than 2.5 sacks. Campbell may not have eye-popping numbers in any one category, but the stat sheet should be stuffed. He is a rangy linebacker making plays all over the field for an Eagles team that promises once again to be in title contention. Emmanwori has been limited to five games played, but his presence is felt when available. He landed in the perfect schematic opportunity with coach Mike Macdonald. As long as Carter leaves the door open, there is room for a rookie like Emmanwori to create a positive narrative for himself and earn consideration. \nEzeiruaku has flashed for a Cowboys team that desperately needs pressure created. It would not be a surprise if he had more inflated sack totals than Carter despite having a lesser impact on the game, as a whole. Johnson has consistently been a good player, but may not have the individual or team accolades to build his case. Sleeper: LB Carson Schwesinger, Browns (+3500)Schwesinger was the favorite at the quarter-season mark. He has more sacks (1) than Carter (0.5) to go along with an interception and more tackles per game than any other rookie. However, he is now dealing with a high ankle sprain that will cost him some time and the Browns aren't going to provide the team-success bump other rookies may receive. \n            ",

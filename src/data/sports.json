Tampa Bay lost to the Saints, 24-20, as 7.5-point favorites last week, and on TNF, Tampa Bay is favored by 4.5 points. The SportsLine Projection Model doesn't expect a repeat of last week, though, making the Buccaneers covering the 4.5-point spread as one of its Thursday best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook for online sports betting. The over/under for total points scored in Falcons vs. Buccaneers is 43.5.The model is backing Over 222.5 total points in Rockets vs. Clippers, while one of SportsLine's top experts has a pick from No. 4 Iowa State taking on Iowa in a rivalry college basketball matchup. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

The Buccaneers are 1-4 over their last five games, however, three of those losses came to teams in the Super Bowl picture, falling to the Rams, Bills and Patriots. Meanwhile, the Falcons (4-9) are 1-7 over their last eight games and are coming off an ugly 37-9 loss to the Seahawks last week. Kirk Cousins is 37 years old as the current Atlanta QB1, and he's clearly not the quarterback he once was. He'll take the field without Drake London (knee) once again. Meanwhile, Baker Mayfield could have reinforcements his way with wide receivers Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan activated from IR. The model projects Tampa Bay to cover in 51% of simulations. Back Tampa Bay at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Clippers vs. Rockets: Over 222.5 points (-108)Kevin Durant and James Harden, former teammates with two different franchises, go head-to-head on Thursday, with Durant leading the Rockets and Harden spearheading the Clippers. Both teams are having significantly different levels of success this season, but with both teams rested and having not played since Saturday, the model projects these veteran superstars to play significant minutes, which could lead to more scoring for themselves and their teammates. The Rockets are fourth in the league in scoring at 120.9 ppg this season, and the Clippers have allowed at least 107 points in 13 of their last 14 contests. The model projects the Over to hit in 62.9% of simulations. Back the Over at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Iowa vs. Iowa State: Under 143.5 points (-110)\"It's fair to speculate if the Hawkeyes can really keep pace in \"Hoops Cy-Hawk\" after Iowa lost contact vs. Michigan State last week,\" SportsLine legendary expert Bruce Marshall said. \"The task of slowing ISU's offense (better than 94 ppg and hitting north of 54% from the floor) will likely come down to how well Ben McCollum's offense controls pace and tempo, and preventing the Cyclones from deploying their devastating transition game that helped bury top-ranked Purdue last Saturday. Easier said than done, but even if winning the game might be a real stretch for Iowa, McCollum's team can slow the pace as good as any, and with four starters (including star G Bennett Stirtz) hitting better than 50% from the floor, the Hawkeyes can afford to be patient.\" Back the Under at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:\nWant more Thursday Night Football, NBA and college basketball picks?You've seen some of the model's Thursday best bets.

    "body": "\n        NASCAR and Michael Jordan's racing team, 23XI, have settled an antitrust lawsuit. On Thursday, the parties reached an agreement over NASCAR's alleged monopoly on U.S. premier stock car racing.Jordan's team, which he co-owns with driver Denny Hamlin, and Front Row Motorsports Inc. reached a deal with NASCAR on the ninth day of their federal trial. The financial agreement will not be publicly disclosed as part of the settlement terms.\"This resolution reflects our shared commitment to maintaining a fair  and equitable framework for long-term participation in America's premier  motorsport, one that supports teams, partners, and stakeholders while  ensuring fans enjoy uninterrupted access to the best racing in the  world,\" according to a joint statement. \"The  agreement allows all parties to move forward with a unified focus on  advancing stock car racing and delivering exceptional competition for  our fans.\" Last year, 23XI and Front Row Motorsports accused NASCAR of anticompetitive and exclusionary practices that financially compromised teams. The lawsuit followed failed negotiations between NASCAR and the racing teams over a new charter agreement, which guarantees money and racing spots in the Cup Series.\"From the beginning, this lawsuit was about progress,\" Jordan said in a  statement after the settlement. \"It was about making sure our sport  evolves in a way that supports everyone: teams, drivers, partners,  employees and fans. \n\"With a foundation to build equity and invest in the  future and a stronger voice in the decisions ahead, we now have the  chance to grow together and make the sport even better for generations  to come.\" In 2016, NASCAR implemented charter agreements, similar to franchising.  The 36 teams involved in the charter agreements were guaranteed entry  into every season race and a larger share of purse money than  non-charter teams. After the previous agreement expired at the end of  the 2024 season, NASCAR gave teams less than one day to agree to the  2025-2031 charter agreement. NASCAR claimed it was its final offer after  months of negotiations. Most teams signed on, but 23XI and Front Row  Motorsports held out, leading to the lawsuit.Judge Bell said the solution was \"the right thing to do.\"\n\"This is going to be great for the entity NASCAR, the industry NASCAR, the teams, the drivers, and as you have so often said yourselves, ultimately the fans,\" Bell said.\n            ",

    "description": "\n        It's been 11 days since the WNBA and WNBPA announced that they agreed to a second extension of the CBA, this one a 40-day extension that move",
    "body": "\n        It's been 11 days since the WNBA and WNBPA announced that they agreed to a second extension of the CBA, this one a 40-day extension that moves the deadline, which was once Oct. 30, to Jan. 9. In the days since, both sides have taken their turns using the media as their messengers, turning up the volume on one of the most important negotiations in women's sports history.The WNBA got the headlines first, with reports that their latest offer included, among other things, a $5 million salary cap, up from $1.5 million; $1 million base max salaries, that would go to $1.2 million with revenue sharing; and a salary structure that includes team and league revenue in the revenue share and yearly pay increases based on the growth of the business, something players have been asking for. But quickly, the WNBPA let it be known that the WNBA's proposal came with some major downsides for players -- such as an end to housing subsidies and a possible March start to training camp -- and that even though the league was offering revenue sharing, the way they were structuring it would result in players receiving just 10 to 15% of projected league revenue.This back-and-forth is to be expected in any high-stakes labor fight, and it's somewhat a relief to be finally getting concrete information out in the open after a year of mostly silence from both parties. But, as someone who has covered and studied labor negotiations in women's sports intensively over the last decade, there is something uniquely disheartening about these particular talks. Because it shows that even as the WNBA has grown to a place where billionaires are tripping over themselves to pay $250 million for an expansion franchise, team valuations are surpassing $500 million, there's a $2.2 billion television deal and revenue, and ratings, attendance and sponsorships are booming, the players at the heart of the WNBA are still battling the powers that be in the league for respect and decency. \n\"I don't feel like there's any cultivation of a culture of trust,\" WNBPA president and Seattle Storm forward Nneka Ogwumike told the Athletic last week. \"We don't feel valued in these talks as they stand today. … I feel like we've been heard, but not listened to. And I'm hoping that that changes in this 40-day extension, because what we want to do is get a good deal done.\"The biggest sticking point in this deal is still revenue sharing. WNBA players have always been paid fixed rates, meaning that the salary cap and salary tiers were set in the collective bargaining agreement and increased by a pre-determined fixed percentage year over year -- 3% in the current CBA. The players have been fighting for a different payment model, one that includes a revenue-sharing component that will allow players' salaries to grow, in real time, as the league grows. The WNBA's current proposal does move in that direction, which is a good thing. But the main dispute now is over what the league is including in the revenue-sharing metric and how much the league is subtracting from the revenue-sharing metric for basic expenses, or what is considered \"cost of revenue.\" It is normal for a small percentage of shared revenue to be withheld for expenses, but the players feel that the league is withholding far too high of a percentage. It is estimated that players will only be making an estimated 10 to 15% of league revenue in the first year of the deal, and that percentage could decrease over the lifetime of the contract. Currently, players make less than 10% of league revenue. In the NBA, players make close to 50% of league revenue. \nThe WNBA, of course, would point to the unprecedented raises they are offering -- more than quadrupling the max salary and raising the salary cap by $3.5 million -- as proof that they are valuing the players, and the compensation model that ties the salary cap to revenue growth as proof that they are listening. And these are important advancements. But it's easy to see why players are still feeling disrespected, especially when you look at the housing proposal.Taking away team housing saves the owners very little money overall, but will serve to make life more complicated and costly for the players who should be focusing their energies on the court, not on securing month-to-month leases in crowded cities during an already jam-packed season. At a time when new leagues such as Project B and Unrivaled are popping out of the woodwork and rolling out the red carpet for players, making them feel like superstars, it feels punitive and petty for the league to take an accommodation away. Despite the skyrocketing business of the WNBA, the league is still signaling that actually, the players aren't worth that much. This is, of course, nothing new. Since practically its inception, WNBA owners have spoken publicly about how much money the league is losing. That messaging has been a self-fulfilling prophecy, something Candace Parker alluded to when she was a guest on the \"All the Smoke\" podcast. \n\"Well, obviously, people respect people with zeros at the end of their checks. Let's just be honest. There's a respect element of things when you walk into a room if you have zeros behind your check,\" Parker said. \"And so I feel like in order for the WNBA to be reputable and to be respected, you have to have zeros behind your check. ...And that has crossed the WNBA off the list for a number of years just because of that. That's been the running joke in the comments.\"Parker is talking about the undeniable social capital and cultural power that comes with being well compensated, a currency that has been denied to most female athletes for far too long. It is understandable that owners would be fighting for a compensation model that they are comfortable with and that will allow them to continue to reinvest into the league, and it's natural that players will have to make some concessions in the negotiating process. Nobody is arguing for WNBA players to earn NBA money. But, with this CBA, the WNBA had a chance to not only raise a salary cap, but to fundamentally shift the public perception around the value of female athletes and the business of women's sports in a way that will permanently boost the bottom line for everyone involved. \nIt's not too late to do just that.\n            ",

Earlier this season, he surpassed his brother and future Hall of Famer JJ Watt on the NFL's career sack list. In 13 games this season, Watt has recorded 7.0 sacks, three forced fumbles, two fumble recoveries and an interception for the Steelers, who are currently 7-6 and lead the Baltimore Ravens by one game in the AFC North standings. \nIf Watt can't face Miami, he will be replaced by Nick Herbig, a fellow former Wisconsin Badger who has made nine starts over the past two years.

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 Major League Baseball offseason is fully underway, and with the Winter Meetings freshly behind us we're working our way deeper into the sport's offseason calendar. Among other things, the winter in baseball means a steady supply of rumors regarding free agent signings, trades, and the like. Speaking of which, you can find Thursday's roundup just below. Braves land reliever SuarezThe Atlanta Braves have agreed to terms with free-agent closer Robert Suarez on a three-year, $45 million contract, the club announced on Thursday. \nEarlier in the offseason, CBS Sports ranked Suarez as the No. 21 available free agent in the current class. Here's part of RJ Anderson's write-up: \"Suarez has garnered a reputation for flakiness. It's not entirely merited. Over the last three seasons, he's compiled more shutdowns and fewer meltdowns than Jeff Hoffman, Ryan Helsley, Matt Strahm, among other high-leverage pitchers with a higher perceived trust rating. One part of Suarez's repute that is valid: his fastball dependency. He upped his changeup rate year to year, but he still threw one heater or the other 75 out of every 100 pitches. If it works, the old parlance goes, it works.\"Suarez, 34, for his career boasts an ERA+ of 141 with an FIP of 3.36 across parts of four MLB seasons, all with the Padres. His 40 saves in 2025 led the National League. In all, the two-time All-Star has struck out 219 batters in 210 career innings. In Atlanta, Raisel Iglesias, who re-signed on a one-year, $16 million deal earlier this winter, figures to get most of the save opportunities, while Suarez will primarily work as a high-leverage setup man, according to the Athletic. Skubal probably on the move?When it comes to repeat American League Cy Young winner Tarik Subal of the Detroit Tigers, trade speculation has been consistent heading into his walk year of 2026 and with no discernible progress made on an extension. On that front, a Skubal trade this offseason is increasingly seen as likely, reports ESPN's Jorge Castillo. \nNeedless to say, such a trade would be the biggest move of the winter in light of Skubal's present level of dominance: \nThose numbers are right in line with what he did in 2024, and the 29-year-old left-hander has the best-in-class stuff to back it up. It goes without saying that any team with any hope of contention in 2026 can use a pitcher of Skubal's rare caliber. That includes, first and foremost, the Tigers, who have logged back-to-back plate appearances. Even so, lead exec Scott Harris may decide he'd rather get a haul now than see Skubal walk at season's end. Cubs getting trade interest in HoernerThe Chicago Cubs are presumably aiming to return to the playoffs again in 2026, which means it would make little sense to trade standout second baseman Nico Hoerner. Hoerner's just 28 and signed through next season at bargain rates. He's also a two-time Gold Glove winner who over the past four seasons has stacked up a total WAR of 19.6. That's not the kind of player a serious team trades away. Still, Hoerner's name has indeed come up in trade conversations with the Cubs, according to the Athletic. Presumably, the Cubs would entertain offers for Hoerner only if it addressed current roster needs elsewhere, but who's to say in light of the listless stewardship of the Ricketts family. \nYankees possibly entertaining Jazz trade talkSpeaking of contenders getting asks on core players, the Yankees have at least indulged inquiries about the trade status of infielder Jazz Chisholm Jr, ESPN reports. Chisholm was a core member of the Yanks last season, as he had an OPS+ of 125 and a WAR of 4.2 in his first full season in the Bronx, and profiles as key piece moving forward. He's 27 and headed into his third and final year of arbitration eligibility in 2026. Payroll of course should not be a concern for the Yankees, but owner Hal Streinbrenner has been reluctant to put the full power of the club's resources into the on-field product. As such, the Chisholm discussions, to whatever extent they're serious, may be viewed as partial salary offsets for moves later in the offseason. Boras pitching Bregman to MarinersStandout infielder Alex Bregman remains on the free-agent market after a strong 2025 season with the Red Sox: \nHe's a three-time All-Star who's still operating at the top of his game and the Red Sox are by all accounts interested in bringing him back. As well, the Cubs and Tigers have also been connected to Bregman and agent Scott Boras is of course busy angling to drum up more interest in one of his marquee clients. Speaking of which, here's this from Adam Jude of the Seattle Times: \n\"Mega agent Scott Boras, representing Alex Bregman, the top free-agent third baseman on the market, has initiated discussions with the Mariners to express Bregman's willingness to consider Seattle as a destination, an industry source told The Times.\"The interest may not be entirely mutual, as the M's are more likely to go with an internal solution at the hot corner next season or add to the infield via trade. No doubt, though, the presence of Bregman would significantly improve Seattle's outlook in 2026 and beyond. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        An important milestone in the 2025-26 NBA season is just days away. Starting on Dec. 15, players who signed a new contract in the offseason are eligible to be traded, which will open up a new world of possibilities for general managers looking to make some moves ahead of the Feb. 5 trade deadline. Nothing that happens this season will be as stunning as last February's Luka Dončić for Anthony Davis swap between the Dallas Mavericks and Los Angeles Lakers, but there could be some league-altering deals over the next few months. Most notably, Giannis Antetokounmpo's future with the Milwaukee Bucks is up in the air, and the two-time MVP could be on the move this winter. Davis, too, has been mentioned as a possible trade candidate as the Mavericks consider their path forward, and may end up having a very short stint in Dallas. \n        \n            \n                Why Giannis Antetokounmpo's trade value seems lower than you'd expect -- and how OKC is partially to blame\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAs Dec. 15 approaches, CBS Sports convened a roundtable to discuss what will happen with Antetokounmpo and Davis, and much more.  \nWill Giannis Antetokounmpo finish the season with the Bucks?Jack Maloney: All along, I've been confident that Giannis would finish this season with the Bucks, but I've started to waver on that belief due to the team's slide down the standings and the barrage of rumors. However, it is going to be tricky to trade him mid-season and he's stubborn and will want to make things work with the Bucks. (His quote to Chris Haynes about wanting to \"run through the wall\" feels notable.) I'm still leaning toward him remaining in Milwaukee until the summer, but the last week has only reinforced the idea that it's a matter of when, not if, he leaves. Robby Kalland: I'll say yes. Making that kind of trade is incredibly difficult during the season, especially given Giannis will have a list of preferred destinations in mind. New York is apparently at the top of that list, but if they couldn't work out a trade before the season, I'm not sure what could change to make that happen. On the Bucks' side, I think the best return possibilities will come in the summer -- especially if the teams with the best potential offers fall short of their goals and have more reason to believe Giannis will fix them.James Herbert: Yes. I think the Bucks should trade him, but that doesn't mean they'll actually do it. I thought they should have traded him last summer, too, and instead they decided it was a good idea to pay Damian Lillard $22.5 million a year to not play for them for the next five seasons. I am skeptical that Antetokounmpo will explicitly request for a trade before February's deadline, and I'm skeptical that anything less than that will motivate Milwaukee to move on.\n\n        \n            \n                Giannis trade rumors, denials, an injury scare and a comeback: Inside the Bucks' wild night\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhether it's now, or in the summer, which team has the best chance to acquire Antetokounmpo?Maloney: The Knicks. Other teams may have more assets, especially in terms of draft picks, but the Knicks have the one thing no other team can buy: Giannis' interest. According to multiple reports from Shams Charania, Brian Windhorst and Jake Fischer, Giannis wants to play for the Knicks. If the Bucks eventually decide to trade Giannis, there's a very good chance they'll work with him to get him to his preferred destination, which gives the Knicks the upper hand. Kalland: San Antonio. They have a glut of young players and picks they can put together in a deal to pair Giannis and Wemby, who would have an argument as the most terrifying and versatile frontcourt combo the league has ever seen. I think they will ride out this season given how well they've played, but like we saw with Houston last year, they'll learn in the playoffs that they're still a piece short. That will give them the impetus to make a stronger push for Giannis, and there's no team – outside of OKC, which is terrifying – that can make a stronger offer for Giannis. The question would be whether Giannis would sign off on going to San Antonio, but I could see him buying into a tag-team with Wemby.Herbert: I'll pick the Hawks. It will be complicated for any team to trade for him, but, in theory, they have the tools to get it done: tradable contracts of every size, young talent and future first-round picks, including that incredible pick they got in the Derik Queen trade.\n\n        \n            \n                Giannis Antetokounmpo trade destinations: Ranking all 29 landing spots with Knicks as the clear No. 1\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhat should the Mavericks do with Anthony Davis?Maloney: If they can get a decent haul this season, I would trade him. They've been better since he's returned, but they aren't a real contender, even if Kyrie Irving comes back. Notably, this is the last year they control their first-round pick until 2031. They're currently outside of even the Play-In spots, and have a real chance to get another top pick in the 2026 draft, which is widely projected to be excellent. If they can flip Davis (and Irving) for young players and/or picks, and add another top-10 selection in 2026, they could completely reset their future around Cooper Flagg. Kalland: Explore what's out there on the trade market, but most likely keep him until the offseason. They should definitely not extend Davis this summer, but I don't think they have to ship him out this season or it's a disaster. Trading Davis is so tricky because there's no chance of getting back anything close to what you gave up for him, but the focus at this point has to be not taking on anything negative in return. They've rebounded some from an awful start, and if Kyrie Irving comes back in January or February, you could see this team sniffing around the 7-8 play-in game. Somewhat similar to Giannis, some teams might be a bit more interested in a deal this summer.Herbert: They should be open to moving him immediately. They're not operating on his timeline anymore, and they have all the incentive in the world to tank right now. And if Dallas isn't interested in the offers they're getting, then I guess it can just keep him around, be conservative about his minutes and trade him in the offseason. I'm not sure the offers will be much better at that point, though, given that he'll be up for an extension.\n\n        \n            \n                Anthony Davis trade rumors: Three East teams emerge as suitors; what could possible deals look like?\n                \n                    Jasmyn Wimbish                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAn anonymous East exec recently said that Trae Young, Ja Morant and LaMelo Ball 'all might have negative value.' Which one would you most want on your team?Maloney: Young has generally been the healthiest of the bunch, which is a big point in his favor, but give me LaMelo. I fully acknowledge that there are real concerns – persistent ankle issues, questionable shot selection, shaky defense  – but I still think he has the highest ceiling of this bunch. Six-foot-seven point guards with his playmaking ability don't come around very often. I'd want to see what he looks like in a different situation. Kalland: Trae Young. I don't think any of them are capable of being The Guy on a great team, but he has the most elite skill of that trio with his passing. While he's missed some time this year, I also just trust him to be on the floor far more often than Morant and Ball at this point. We haven't ever really seen what LaMelo looks like in a winning context, whereas we have seen Young and Morant playing at a high level on a team that's won. However, so much of Morant's game is predicated on elite athleticism that you fear injuries have caused that to slip and taken away his effectiveness attacking the rim.Herbert: Right now, I'd most want Young on my team. If I'm trading for one of them, though, the answer is probably Ball. He's still just 24, and I might be able to talk myself into him rounding out his game and realizing his star potential in a new environment. I wouldn't immediately have to deal with him being eligible for a contract extension, either.\nWhat on Earth do the Clippers do ahead of the deadline?Maloney: The rest of the league would hate them for trying to move Kawhi Leonard and James Harden, because it would guarantee the Thunder another top draft pick (and possibly two considering OKC has swap rights to the Clippers' 2027 first as well) but I think it's time to shop Kawhi Leonard and James Harden. Try to recoup some picks and/or young players, reset the books and chart a new path forward. This group's run is over.  Kalland: If able, blow it up. It's time. You got the arena built with a team that was a playoff contender, which was one of the main goals of the Kawhi era. You never reached the heights you wanted, but it seems pretty clear that there is not a path forward where you can simply re-tool with stars this old. Leonard and James Harden may still have some trade value left, and while I don't ever think Steve Ballmer will accept a full-scale rebuild, it's time to try to get some draft assets, clear the books some to make a run at new free agents and see if you can't plant some new trees, if you will.Herbert: There's no great answer here. If I'm the GM, I'm trying to trade Kawhi Leonard and James Harden, and I might even put Ivica Zubac on the block, too. I worry, though, that they'll go the other way, in hopes of salvaging the season by sneaking into the play-in.\n            ",

    "body": "\nWe were lucky to be on the biggest lookahead line move of the week due to the injury to Daniel Jones, which took the Colts from 3.5-point underdogs all the way up to +13.5. Now, one could argue that even the most elite of NFL quarterbacks aren't worth 10 points on the spread, and surely a Daniel Jones moving around on one leg due to a fractured fibula is not in the top tier of NFL quarterbacks, but that is an argument for another time in place.Here, we're interested in where next week's spreads will be when they reopen on Sunday evening versus where they are right now. Other lookahead moves from last week saw favorites flip in Commanders-Giants due to the injury to Jayden Daniels, and in Bills-Patriots due to reasons I don't really know. The Bills won but didn't cover against the Bengals, and that was after Joe Burrow gave them interceptions on consecutive plays to turn the game around completely.What line moves can we predict this week? Let's take a look at the Week 16 lookahead lines at DraftKings and then share our best bets to lock in early.Week 16 lookahead linesRams at Seahawks (-1.5), 47.5Eagles (-5.5) at Commanders, 45.5Packers (-3.5) at Bears, 45.5Buccaneers (-1.5) at Panthers, 45.5Bills (-8.5) at Browns, 42.5Chargers at Cowboys (-2.5), 48.5Chiefs (-10.5) at Titans, 41.5Vikings (-1.5) at Giants, 43.5Bengals (-1.5) at Dolphins, 50.5Jets at Saints (-3.5), 40.5Jaguars at Broncos (-2.5), 43.5Falcons at Cardinals (-1.5), 45.5Steelers at Lions (-6.5), 49.5Raiders at Texans (-12.5), 37.5Patriots at Ravens (-2.5), 48.549ers (-6) at Colts, 45.5Week 16 lookahead picksBuccaneers at PanthersThe Buccaneers play on Thursday, and we're going to get a good gauge of what to expect from the market with their rating once we see how the offense looks with Mike Evans back on the field. If they secure a relatively easy win and the Panthers fall to the Saints, we might see this line more toward -3. I think it's more likely it gets to pick 'em or potentially through the zero with how strong Carolina has looked the last few weeks.Patriots at RavensThe prevailing thought seems to be the Bills will have no trouble beating the Patriots, a team that is not as good as its record indicates. But if the Patriots win that game, I think they'll have a good chance to be favored here. That's because the Ravens have looked broken for weeks, to the point I'm not counting on them to win in Cincinnati. There's a chance that there will be a difference of six wins between these teams when they square off, and unless there's a major injury for the Patriots, I think they'll deserve to be pick 'em at worst.Bills at BrownsEven if the Bills do beat the Patriots, it's going to take a major margin of victory to move this up even further than 8.5 considering how well regarded the Browns' defense is, particularly at home. Yes, the Titans scored 31 last week, but you can chalk most of that up to two long runs and superior special teams play as the Browns' defense gave up just 118 yards on 12 drives after a rough first quarter that included one of those big runs. The Cleveland offense also seems to be on the rise with Shedeur Sanders at QB, and the jury is out on whether the Bills' defense will be healthy enough to expect them to do what's needed to win this by double digits.Other notes: The Bears are 3.5-point underdogs against the Packers even though we saw those teams play a close one in Green Bay last week, with a tie broken by a Packers touchdown under the four-minute mark in the fourth quarter. In Chicago, we might expect a similar game to finish by a three-point margin either way, so it might be wise to try and lock in a +3.5 now ... Miami has been one of the hottest teams in football over the last five weeks, but the Dolphins find themselves as home 'dogs against a team out of the playoff race in the Bengals. The Dolphins don't play until Monday night, so the reopen is going to depend on how the Bengals look against the Ravens, and there could be an opportunity to get a bigger number before locking in the Dolphins as a play ... The Raiders are once again double-digit underdogs in a game with a total below 40, and again in a matchup with an offense that isn't exactly scoring points in bunches as the Texans have averaged just under 20 points over the last four weeks. If they can cover against the Eagles this week, even in a 17-10 type of game, it could move this one down a touch as well.\n            ",

That means he's in danger of missing the remainder of the regular season. Hendrickson has not played since Week 8. In seven games played this season, he has recorded 16 tackles, eight QB hits, four sacks and three tackles for loss. Hendrickson led the NFL in sacks last season with 17.5, and became just the fifth player in NFL history to record 17 sacks in back-to-back seasons. He recorded 49% of the Bengals' sacks last season, which was the highest rate in the NFL and the eighth-highest percentage in NFL history. Cincinnati had the NFL's leader in passing yards with Joe Burrow, the NFL's leader in receiving yards with Ja'Marr Chase and the sack king in Hendrickson, yet still missed the playoffs.\n\n        \n            \n                Predicting the entire 2025 NFL playoff bracket and Super Bowl winner as we enter Week 15\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAfter yet another contract-related standoff this offseason, Hendrickson agreed to accept a $14 million raise in August to bring his 2025 salary to $30 million. It's possible he has played his last down with the Bengals, as the 31-year-old is set to hit free agency. Following the Week 14 loss to the Buffalo Bills, the Bengals are going to need some help to make the postseason. The 7-6 Pittsburgh Steelers have a 73% chance to win the AFC North, while the Bengals have a 3.1% chance to capture the division and make the playoffs, according to SportsLine. \nCincinnati has a home game with the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday before facing the Miami Dolphins on the road in Week 16 and closing out the season by hosting the Arizona Cardinals in Week 17 and the Cleveland Browns in Week 18. \n            \n    ",

The Coliseum has been USC's home since 1923 but the Trojans might have to play their 2028 home football games at SoFi Stadium after the Coliseum hosts track-and-field events for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics and Paralympic Games, according to the Los Angeles Times. There is a chance the $100 million temporary track being built will not be torn down in time for the start of the 2028 football season, the Times reports. That temporary track is being built on top of USC's football field. Not only will it need to be torn down following the July 30, 2028, closing ceremony, but the playing surface would also have to be restored by September to be ready for the football season. Because the Coliseum boasts a field made of natural grass, that restoration process takes more time. \"USC and LA28 are working in lockstep on all logistics for the Olympic and Paralympic Games,\" USC spokesperson Cody Worsham said in a statement to the Los Angeles Times. \"We will share details with the public when they are finalized.\"\nA final decision has not been made and it's possible the field could be ready later in the season, allowing the Trojans to play part of the 2028 season at their historic home stadium. SoFi Stadium will also host certain Olympic events, but it was constructed as a multi-use venue with an artificial turf. It's already home to the NFL's Los Angeles Chargers and Los Angeles Rams, though their schedules likely wouldn't interfere with USC's slate, given that the college football season starts earlier and a majority of college football games are played on Saturdays. \nThere is a chance that UCLA will host its home games inside SoFi Stadium by the 2028 season as well. The Bruins are actively trying to relocate from the Rose Bowl to SoFi. The City of Pasadena and the Rose Bowl recently filed a lawsuit against UCLA for allegedly attempting to break its lease. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Jason Collins, whose NBA career spanned 13 years and six different teams, announced on Thursday that he has Stage 4 brain cancer. Specifically Collins has glioblastoma, a common form of brain cancer that spreads aggressively and quickly.In an open letter published by ESPN, Collins detailed what led to the diagnosis. He shared how he had difficulty focusing, was struggling to complete simple tasks due to brain fog, and his short-term memory was declining. He underwent a CT scan at UCLA that uncovered the brain tumor.\"What makes glioblastoma so dangerous is that it grows within a very finite, contained space -- the skull -- and it's very aggressive and can expand,\" Collins said. \"What makes it so difficult to treat in my case is that it's surrounded by the brain and is encroaching upon the frontal lobe -- which is what makes you, 'you.'\"The NBA released a statement in September to share the news of Collins undergoing treatment for what was called a brain tumor. Collins said the statement was purposefully vague, as his family wanted to give him privacy while he was dealing with the diagnosis.\nNow, though, he wants to share his journey in hopes that it can help someone else dealing with the same diagnosis.\"When my grandmother got sick with Stage 4 stomach cancer, she didn't like people saying the word \"cancer,\" Collins said. \"She never wanted that word being spoken. I am on the opposite end of the spectrum. I don't care if you say the word. I have cancer, but just like my grandmother fought it, I'm going to fight it.\"Collins has been undergoing radiation to slow the growth of the brain tumor, as well as targeted chemotherapy in Singapore that is geared towards fighting the specific type of tumor he has.\n\"The goal is to keep fighting the progress of the tumors long enough for a personalized immunotherapy to be made for me, and to keep me healthy enough to receive that immunotherapy once it's ready,\" Collins said.Though Collins had a lengthy NBA career, he became a trailblazer in the sports world for being the first active openly gay player in league history when he came out in 2013. Just as Collins paved the way for gay athletes after him, he hopes that by sharing his story about his brain cancer, he can also help others.\"After I came out, someone I really respect told me that my choice to live openly could help someone who I might never meet,\" Collins said. \"I've held onto that for years. And if I can do that again now, then that matters.\"\n            ",

The Buccaneers will be wearing their Creamsicle jerseys on Thursday night, which will mark the only time during the 2025 season that Tampa Bay will be breaking out its iconic uniform. \nThe Buccaneers are wearing the uniforms as part of their 50th anniversary celebration. With the Buccaneers wearing a colored jersey, the opposing team would normally wear white, but that won't be the case in this game. The Falcons will also wearing a throwback uniform in Week 15. The throwback look will feature Atlanta's red helmets combined with the team's black jersey. \nThis matchup will mark the first time in two years that a game will happen without a team wearing white. The last time it happened came in Week 8 of the 2023 season and that also involved the Falcons in a game against the Tennessee Titans. There was also an all-color game when the Chicago Bears wore orange in Week 8 of the 2022 season against the Dallas Cowboys, who were suited up in their navy blue jerseys. \nIt's rare that you'll see a color vs. color game in the NFL. Although the league embraced the theme during the Color Rush years from 2015-2018 -- a span where there were multiple color vs. color games -- the Buccaneers-Falcons game will mark just the third time since the start of the 2021 season that we've seen a color vs. color game where neither team was wearing a Color Rush uniform. \nThe fact that the Bucs are celebrating their 50th season is also kind of interesting. The Thursday night game is being played on Dec. 11, which is notable, because that will mark the 48th anniversary of the Buccaneers' first win in franchise history. The Bucs, who played their first season in 1976, started 0-26 before winning their first game in December 1977. \n            \n    ",

Stroud. McNair and Stroud quickly went viral following the Texans' win over the Kansas City Chiefs this past Sunday night when Stroud left Houston's owner hanging on his way off the field. McNair got the last laugh, though, after the Texans created a video of McNair continuing to keep his hand raised as he went about his usual day at the team's facility. The video ended with McNair and Stroud sharing a laugh -- and a high-five -- after a recent practice.  \n\n\nThere are plenty of reasons for McNair and his team to be happy at this point in the season. After an 0-3 start, the Texans are currently 8-5 and riding a five-game winning streak. Houston has leapfrogged over the Indianapolis Colts and now are just one game behind the Jacksonville Jaguars for first place in the AFC South with four weeks to go in the regular season. One of the main reasons for the Texans' turnaround has been the play of Stroud, who is completing a career-high 63.4% of his passes this season. Houston's defense has also loomed large as the unit has allowed the fewest points in football through 14 weeks.  \nThe Texans will look to extend their winning streak to six on Sunday at home against the Arizona Cardinals.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        ORLANDO, Fla. -- Major League Baseball's annual Winter Meetings ended Wednesday without much sizzle on baseball's hot stove. Kyle Schwarber is back with the Phillies. Edwin Díaz and Pete Alonso are both leaving the Mets, giving the Dodgers a new closer and the Orioles a new slugger. Otherwise it was pretty quiet in central Florida with the MLB world gathered in one spot.However, the market has been set for what still should be an interesting offseason. So why were the Winter Meetings so slow? And what's next this winter? Why was the market so slow at the meetings? As mentioned, it was a relatively slow week at this year's Winter Meetings. It was largely viewed as a place for conversation but not much movement. \"Believe me when I say that I'm not being snarky,\" one executive intimated. \"There is no deadline related to the Winter Meetings. So, front offices are not gonna feel pressured by the media or fan sentiment to make a deal for the sake of making a deal during a three-day event.\"\nThe executive, however, did offer a solution, saying that it would be interesting if the league introduced an offseason deadline.\"That plus a salary cap and maybe even a floor would get us closer to how other leagues operate where there's more activity condensed into a shorter period,\" the exec added. \"But with the way we're set up with a long offseason and no deadlines, teams, players and agents are going to hold out until the last minute for the best possible deal.\"What's next?\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Mets leave Orlando with a lot of added pressureThe prevailing emotion around the meetings was shock when it came to the Mets. Their trade for Marcus Semien in exchange for Brandon Nimmo last month was the first move that made people stop and reassess how different the Mets could look next season. Especially given Semien's two consecutive down seasons. Still, Semien is a veteran. He has won a World Series, and on a team that has had clashes among its stars and a reputation for internal turmoil, he can be the ultimate professional. But when the Mets lost out on Díaz -- who bolted to Los Angeles without giving them a chance to counter -- it confirmed what many around the game had sensed: The changes are going to be seismic in Queens. Then, on Wednesday, Pete Alonso made the Mets' new reality even more stark. He agreed to a five-year contract with the O's at $155 million -- numbers the Mets were seemingly not comfortable with.\nJust what are the Mets doing? That was the question floating around Orlando as the Winter Meetings wound down. Real criticism began to shift toward president of baseball operations David Stearns. Can he close? He proved he could build a winner in Milwaukee, but how will he shape a club with both money and expectations? The Mets now have a gaping hole at first base where a cornerstone in Alonso once stood. And they still need pitching. The pressure is on Stearns and the Mets to answer in the coming weeks and plenty of notable names still available through free agency and trades.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Dodgers flex off-field might once againLet's stay with the Dodgers for a moment. Manager Dave Roberts said this week he was comfortable with his club as it stood. Then they went out and landed Díaz (on a three-year, $69 million deal), who could easily slide into the closer's role, moving Tanner Scott -- who struggled in 2025 -- to an eighth-inning role. While other teams pinch pennies, the Dodgers keep finding ways to dominate both on the field and in the transactional game.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Could Bregman top $160 million?Boston was very quiet this week, as fans wait for a big-money move. The Red Sox were \"in\" on Kyle Schwarber -- they didn't get him. The Sox were \"in\" on Alonso, too, but according to a source, the Sox made an offer nowhere close to what Alonso received from the Orioles. The American League East is stacked, and if the Sox don't get Alex Bregman, they might be at the bottom of it. \n\"Alex earned the right contract-wise to opt out and see what's going on,\" Red Sox manager Alex Cora said. \"And we know he was very important last year and there's a lot of leaders out there who are good players, too. So we'll see what the future holds.\"\nStill on the topic of Bregman, one industry source believes that after the Alonso and Schwarber deals, Bregman's could be in the range of five years and $165 million or more. That might be an overpay, but is dictated by the market that has already been set. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Just how good is the O's lineup now?The O's were expected to be big players this offseason and they certainly got off to a good start after inking that deal with Alonso. Executives around the league believe that Baltimore might just have the best lineup in baseball as Alonso joins Gunnar Henderson, Jackson Holliday, Adley Rutschman, Jordan Westburg and Taylor Ward. Still, they need to add to their pitching staff if they want to be competitive.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    'Little traction' on Ketel Marte trade right nowMarte's name came up a ton this week, but one source said he's just a popular name with little traction at the moment. Arizona is not interested in moving him at the moment, the source said. That could very much change as the market plays out during the offseason, but, remember, the Diamondbacks are just a couple of years removed from a World Series berth and was widely viewed as a team that just underperformed last year. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    What are the Yankees doing? New York has shown itself to be a stubborn club, firm in its convictions. Brian Cashman said the Yankees won't wait on Cody Bellinger and will start pursuing other options. But when asked what he could do to improve the roster, he offered, \"the needs aren't so glaring.\" In a loaded division, that mindset could come back to haunt them.The Athletic reported that Scott Boras may wait for Kyle Tucker and his group to sign before turning to Bellinger's market. And with the Mets desperate for a significant splash, Queens might end up being the cleanest fit for Bellinger, who can handle all three outfield spots and first base.\nAs for the Yankees, Cashman said they need to add \"a bit more versatility,\" which sounded like code for leaning heavily on internal options rather than diving into larger free agent signings. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Tennessee has hired Jim Knowles as its next defensive coordinator following the firing of Tim Banks earlier this week, the university announced Thursday. The move signals a major effort by coach Josh Heupel to re-establish his team's defensive identity after a costly drop-off in performance in 2025.Banks, who was dismissed Monday after five seasons in Knoxville, saw his defense collapse this fall. Once a unit that helped carry Tennessee into the College Football Playoff just a season ago, the Volunteers surrendered 28.8 points per game and allowed 395.5 yards on average -- both third-worst in the SEC.Enter Knowles, who after spending 2025 at Penn State, was not retained by incoming coach Matt Campbell and found a landing spot in Knoxville.Knowles' coaching résumé is among the most decorated for a defensive coordinator. Before Penn State, he spent three seasons as defensive coordinator at Ohio State -- including the 2024 national championship season, when his defense ranked No. 1 in the country in both scoring (12.9) and total defense (254.6).\n\"Hiring Jim Knowles was our top priority from the start of this process,\" Heupel said in a statement. \"Jim has a proven track record of developing elite defenses that play with an edge, and we got to see that first-hand during the 2024 College Football Playoff. His defenses are always physical, well prepared and can adapt quickly in-game against today's complex offenses. He's a competitor, a winner and someone who will get the most out of our players in practice and on gameday. \"We are thrilled to welcome Jim to Rocky Top as he helps us chase championships.\"      Earlier stops at Oklahoma State (2018-21) and Duke (2010-17) likewise cemented his reputation as a sharp defensive strategist and solid developer of talent. \nWhat does it mean for Tennessee?For Tennessee, the hire represents a clear acknowledgment that 2025's defensive collapse cannot be ignored. Bringing in a coordinator with championship-level pedigree and experience retooling defenses at multiple Power Four programs may be exactly what the Volunteers need to rebound. Especially with questions lingering over depth and scheme consistency after a turnover-heavy roster and porous secondary -- which ranked 115th in passing yards allowed per game (248.8) -- derailed the season.But the fit isn't guaranteed to be seamless, and Knowles inherits sizable challenges. Transitioning to his system typically requires an adjustment period, a trend reflected in the modest results during his first seasons at Oklahoma State and Ohio State before each defense made significant Year 2 leaps, followed by even sharper refinement and consistency in Year 3. His only previous SEC experience also came more than two decades ago as a linebackers coach at Ole Miss in 2003, adding another layer of adaptation as he steps back into the conference.\nTennessee will likely need to lean on the transfer portal and recruiting to fill holes, particularly in the secondary and along the interior of the defensive front. Why Knowles' adaptability matters for TennesseeOne of the more revealing parts of Knowles' career arc is how flexible he has been when circumstances demand it. Across multiple stops, his defenses have reflected not just his own schematic preferences but the realities of the roster in front of him. At Ohio State, that meant shelving some of the three-man front structures and hybrid packages that became staples of his work at Oklahoma State and Duke. The Buckeyes' established four-down philosophy -- and the presence of veteran defensive line coach Larry Johnson deeply rooted in that approach -- forced Knowles to build a top-ranked unit through a different lens. He created a defense that remained aggressive while fitting the strengths of a deep, traditional Big Ten front.But that flexibility has limits. Knowles left Ohio State after a national championship season in part because expanded oversight from Ryan Day narrowed his ability to independently shape the defense. For a coach known for disappearing into the film room and emerging with intricate game plans tailored to matchups and personnel, that autonomy matters. \nTennessee could be betting that giving Knowles space -- and players suited to his toolbox -- will unlock the creativity and week-to-week adaptability that have defined his best work.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Major League Baseball's Winter Meetings are freshly behind us, and while there was a good bit of notable activity that took place over the three-day hootenanny in Orlando, there's still much to be resolved across the remainder of the offseason calendar. That –- what's left for teams to do and free agents to decide –- is now our focus. So let's set the scene for the deeper reaches of winter and the rest of the MLB offseason by exploring 10 questions, the answers to which will shape rosters across the league before spring training and the 2026 season arrive. Onward. 1. How will the Mets plug their new holes?You can't sensibly judge an offseason at this relatively early hour, but after the Mets let franchise home run leader Pete Alonso go to the Orioles and All-Star closer Edwin Díaz to the Dodgers those judgments are flying. Now, though, comes the work of replacing the 6.4 combined WAR that just headed out the door. The recent signing of Devin Williams, who's a strong bounceback candidate in 2026, gives them an option at closer, and there's of course plenty of time to turn up additional bullpen depth from the right side. As for first base, they've already had at least cursory discussions with the Cardinals about Willson Contreras' availability in trade, according to MLB.com. He's of course not the only option at that non-premium position. There's plenty of time to address those needs and perhaps fortify the rotation, and it won't be surprising if the Mets are among the more active teams from this point forward.\n        \n            \n                After letting Pete Alonso and Edwin Díaz walk in free agency, what do the Mets do now?\n                \n                    Matt Snyder                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n2. Will the Orioles address their rotation next?As just noted above, the O's swung big at the Winter Meetings by adding Alonso's power bat to the lineup on a five-year, $155 million free-agent contract. His addition helps the Baltimore cause in 2026 and beyond, but they still need help in a rotation that's both thin and in want of another frontline presence to accompany Trevor Rogers. Needle-movers like Framber Valdez and Ranger Suárez are still available on the free-agent market right now, and that's to say nothing of the starting pitchers who may or may not be on the trade block (a number of whom play for the Marlins). The implied question, then, is how committed the Orioles are, whether it be in terms of payroll or a willingness to deal prospects, after indulging in half-measures for too long. We'll find out. \n3. Where will Kyle Tucker sign? Tucker is our top-ranked free agent for this offseason and, at this writing, he's still available. He's going into his age-29 campaign in 2026, which makes him reasonably young as top-line free agents go, and he's a steady provider of broad-based excellence. For his career, Tucker boasts an OPS+ of 139, and over the last half-decade he's averaged 5.1 WAR per season. In 2025 with the Cubs, he might have wound up firmly in the MVP discussion had a hand injury not sapped his mid-summer production at the plate (he still wound up with a 143 OPS+). Needless to say, Tucker would be a middle-of-the-lineup force for any team. Among those realistic fits are the Dodgers, Blue Jays, Giants, Mets, and Yankees.4. Will those rumors of a Padres blockbuster come true?The Padres remain in contending mode, but lead decision-maker A.J. Preller is a bit hamstrung by payroll constraints from the post-Peter Seidler ownership group in San Diego and, when it comes to making trades that improve the current roster, a hollowed-out farm system. Even so, the ever-bold Preller may yet again be aiming high. Let's look back to this tantalizingly vague Winter Meetings nugget from the San Diego Union-Tribune: \"Two sources familiar with the Padres' discussions said Preller is shooting big.\"One source said the Padres are working multiple fronts that could result in deals that rival the massive trade in which they acquired four major leaguers in exchange for Juan Soto and Trent Grisham at the winter meetings two years ago. Another source said Preller's plans coming to fruition would make the deals he made at the past two trade deadlines pale in comparison.\"The sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly, provided no further details.\"Does this mean the Padres are looking to deal away some of their big contracts while navigating no-trade clauses? Or are they looking to finagle another major win-now move despite those aforementioned limitations? Fernando Tatis Jr. has been the subject of recent trade speculation, but multiple recent reports have it that the Padres are committed to keeping the face of the franchise. Could Jackson Merrill be potentially involved in whatever's cooking? That's what MLB.com's Mark Feinsand speculated soon after the above report came out. As return flights from Orlando touch down, the unknowns outweigh the knowns when it comes to Preller's plans. No doubt, though, he has sky-scraping aspirations as the Padres try to wring out another run from their current core. \n        \n            \n                Ranking top 50 MLB free agents for 2026: Kyle Tucker, Alex Bregman at top, plus landing spots for every player\n                \n                    R.J. Anderson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n5. Do the Dodgers have another big splash in them?Even coming off back-to-back World Series titles and with a roster that still includes the superstar likes of Shohei Ohtani, Mookie Betts, Freddie Freeman, and Yoshinobu Yamamoto, the Dodgers aren't letting off the gas. As noted above, they've already landed closer Edwin Díaz on a $69 million pact, and the expectation is that they'll do more in the weeks to come. The Kyle Tucker rumors are out there, and indeed the Dodgers could use an upgrade at one of the outfield corners. They're the most attractive destination in MLB for players, and they have vast resources and -- most critically -- a willingness to use them. The safe assumption is that Andrew Friedman isn't done grabbing headlines this winter. 6. Will Ketel Marte be dealt?The Diamondbacks are listening -- \"actively listening,\" in the common parlance of trade rumors -- to offers for stalwart infielder Ketel Marte. They're in need of pitching help and they're seemingly willing to trade one of their best players to get it. Marte's possibly fraying relationship with the team may be playing a role here, but mostly it's about trading from a strength for what the club perceives as a greater need. Marte is 32 and signed through at least 2030 (with a player option for 2031). However, he's signed at bargain rates, and he's coming off a 2025 season in which he amassed a 4.4 WAR in 126 games. Teams in need of a bedrock second baseman are no doubt engaging the Snakes in talks. Will it be the Red Sox? The Blue Jays? The Reds? Someone else? Right now, it seems likely that Marte will be moved, but it could all be complicated by the other second basemen who are the reportedly on the block -- Brendan Donovan of the Cardinals and Brandon Lowe of the Rays. 7. Will the Yankees reunite with Cody Bellinger?Bellinger with his 5.1 WAR in 2025 was a big part of the Yankees' regular-season success and their ability to paper over the free agent loss of Juan Soto to the Mets. That means there's a great deal of pressure to bring back Bellinger to the Bronx, at least in the absence of a Tucker signing. Bellinger opted out of his $25 million guarantee for 2026, so he's no doubt looking for a substantial multi-year guarantee. It'll be a serious blow to the Yankees' hopes next season and beyond, especially in the hotly competitive American League East, if Bellinger lands elsewhere. \n\n        \n            \n                Ranking top 25 MLB trade candidates: Players who could be moved before 2026 season and potential landing spots\n                \n                    Mike Axisa                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n8. Will the Cardinals trade their remaining veterans?The Cardinals under new lead decision-maker Chaim Bloom are emphasizing the long-term and an ongoing reboot of the club's player-development program. That means trades of veterans for prospect depth, and we've already seen that with the Sonny Gray trade to the Red Sox. He's not going to be the last out of the door. Mentioned above is the possibility that the Mets deal for Contreras (and outfielder Lars Nootbaar). Donovan is Bloom's most valuable trade piece, and the Cardinals have had discussions with multiple teams about his services. As well, the club is working to find a fit for decline-phase Nolan Arenado and his no-trade clause, and lefty reliever JoJo Romero is also probably going to be moved. Will the sell-off grow to include younger talents like Nolan Gorman? That remains to be seen. What's certain is that Bloom and the Cardinals will be making multiple trades of note before the offseason is over. 9. Will the Cubs do something big?The Cubs, coming off their first playoff berth in a full season since 2018, should be firmly in buy mode, but the Ricketts continue to refuse to press their substantial financial advantage over the rest of the National League Central. Tucker, to repeat, is almost certain to sign elsewhere. At that point, the central matter becomes replacing his lost value. The Cubs are looking to fortify the rotation and they've also been connected to Alex Bregman. Whatever the specifics, they need to behave aggressively if they're going to surmount the Brewers in the division. 10. Will the Red Sox bring back Alex Bregman? Speaking of Bregman, he was a fulcrum in his lone season in Boston and the Sox very much want to bring him back. They're positioned to contend for years to come with their impressive core of young talent, but they need a veteran known quantity or three to round out the roster. After opting out of his Sox contract, Bregman is no doubt seeking a long-term commitment, and Boston of course has the wherewithal to meet any such demand. There are fallback plans such as a trade for Marte or Donovan, but the most obvious path is a Bregman reunion. \nWe'll see if it happens, just as we'll see how all these other questions are answered before pitchers and catchers begin trickling into camps. Much has happened already, but there's even more to come. \n            ",

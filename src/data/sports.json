    "body": "\n        Revenge may not be one of the top factors you consider when constructing your Fantasy football strategy, but perhaps it should be for your Week 12 Fantasy football picks. Several players will see former employers, such as Christian McCaffrey versus Carolina, Aaron Jones versus Green Bay and Baker Mayfield versus the Rams. While McCaffrey is a must-start for Week 12 Fantasy football lineups, the others may get a bit of a boost in the eyes of some managers. That's especially considering the injuries to players like Aaron Rodgers and Josh Jacobs that could have ramifications, as well as the loss of Michael Penix Jr. (knee) for the season, which will reshape the Atlanta offense. Cincinnati's offense is especially a challenge to forecast this week with Ja'Marr Chase (suspension) out, but quarterback Joe Burrow (toe) potentially back. Add in that there's twice as many teams on a bye this week than last, and there's lots to keep track of when sorting out what Fantasy football advice to follow. Before making your Week 12 Fantasy football picks, be sure to check out the Week 12 Fantasy football rankings from the proven computer model at SportsLine. Bet on every NFL Week 12 game at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your $5 initial wager wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:When it comes to ranking players, SportsLine's model beat human experts in Fantasy football for the past several seasons, especially when there were big differences in ranking. Over the course of a season, that could literally be the difference between winning your league or going home empty-handed.The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, including being ahead of the curve on players like A.J. Brown, Jonathan Taylor, Derrick Henry, Christian McCaffrey, Alvin Kamara and Jahmyr Gibbs. Anybody who banked on players like those could have made a run at their league title.Now, the model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, has revealed its Fantasy football rankings for Week 12 of the 2025 NFL season. Head to SportsLine now to see them. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. Top Week 12 Fantasy football picks One surprise in Week 12: The model is fading Cowboys QB Dak Prescott, who is the QB8 entering Week 12 and is coming off a four-touchdown game. Prescott beat up on the lowly Raiders this past Monday, but he won't get nearly as easy a matchup this week versus Philadelphia. Only one team has allowed fewer passing touchdowns than the Eagles this year, as Philly has kept six straight starting QBs to one passing touchdown or fewer. Prescott had his worst game of the year versus Philly in Week 1, with his fewest touchdowns (zero) and fewest passing yards (188). With that taken into account, the Cowboys quarterback sits outside the top 15 in quarterback rankings and is one to fade for Week 12 Fantasy football lineups.Another curveball: The model is high on Jaguars wideout Parker Washington, who sits outside the top 40 receivers in both standard and PPR leagues. Washington has become nearly an every-down player for the Jags with recent injuries to Travis Hunter and Brian Thomas Jr. The third-year wideout's had at least 62 scrimmage yards or a touchdown in three of his last four games. The Jags face Arizona on Sunday, and the Cards have allowed six different wideouts to have at least 54 yards or a touchdown over the last three weeks. The model has Washington as a top 20 wideout in the Week 12 Fantasy football rankings, even slotting him ahead of Justin Jefferson.

This pick could be the difference between winning big and going home with nothing.

Two of those five go head-to-head on Friday when the UNLV Rebels host the Hawaii Rainbow Warriors at 10:30 p.m. ET. One of SportsLine's top experts has picked a side on Hawaii vs. UNLV to include in SportsLine's Friday best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook.The SportsLine Projection Model has a top pick in NBA action as well, backing the Timberwolves as 3.5-point favorites over the Suns.

I don't really look at models that much these days. But this seems a bit low to me; apparently crazy low to our model as it has UNLV by about three TDs. I don't agree with that as the Rebs are 0-4 ATS in their past four as home favorites. But they lead the Mountain West in takeaways (18), PPG (36.6), yards per play (6.88) and yards per game (459.3). This should be a shootout won by UNLV.\" Back UNLV at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Timberwolves (-3.5) vs. Suns (-115)After a 2-3 start to the season, the Timberwolves are 8-2 over their last 10 games to sit at 10-5 on the year. Anthony Edwards and Julius Randle have been arguably the best duo in the NBA this season, as one of only two pairs of teammates averaging at least 25 ppg this season. Edwards is averaging 25.2 ppg, while Randle is at 25 ppg with the two playing at All-Star levels. Meanwhile, Devin Booker has to shoulder the majority of the production in Phoenix, as he's averaging 27.8 ppg this season. The Timberwolves are 6-1 over their last seven games, winning those contests by an average of 20.5 ppg, leading the model to project the Timberwolves to cover the spread in 55% of simulations.  Back Minnesota at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Georgia (-9.5) vs. Xavier (-112)\"It was the best effort yet by the X in its last game when demolishing Old Dominion 99-69. The Monarchs, however, look near the bottom of the Sun Belt, and facing an SEC side that made the Dance last season is a completely different situation,\" SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall said. \"The Musketeers finally got some 3-balls to fall (16 of 'em) vs. ODU, but consistent offense has been an issue for Richard Pitino's squad that's still shooting only 39.5% from the floor. Meanwhile, at 5-0, the Bulldogs can count a win over nearby ACC Georgia Tech and blowouts in its other four games, with Cal transfer guard Jeremiah Wilkinson (15.6 ppg) already running the show and fueling an offense scoring a tick beneath 100 ppg.\" Back Georgia at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:\nWant more college football, college basketball and NBA picks?You've seen some of the model's Friday best bets.

    "body": "\n        As the regular season winds down, pressure is mounting for some of college football's most prominent programs. With only two weeks left before the postseason, most teams are running out of time to impress the College Football Playoff selection committee.Only five conference champions are guaranteed a playoff spot. The other seven at-large bids remain up for grabs, and at this point any team in the CFP Rankings has a path to the 12-team field.No conference championship matchups are set yet, either. Some leagues, like the SEC and Big Ten, appear fairly cut-and-dry, but the Big 12 and ACC remain wide open. Six Big 12 teams are still alive for a spot in their title game, and four ACC teams carry just one conference loss.All of that sets up a busy stretch over the next two weekends. So which games deserve your attention this Saturday? Here's a viewer's guide to help navigate the Week 11 action.\nThe best games No. 22 Missouri at No. 8 Oklahoma -- noon on ABC, fuboTV (try for free): Oklahoma is one of the nation's hottest teams over the past few weeks. After back-to-back road wins against ranked conference opponents -- No. 20 Tennessee and No. 10 Alabama -- the Sooners return home to face old rival Missouri. The Tigers beat Oklahoma last season in the programs' first meeting since 2011, and a repeat on Saturday could knock the Sooners out of the CFP race entirely.No. 15 USC at No. 7 Oregon -- 3:30 p.m. on CBS, CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App, Paramount+ Premium: The Pac-12 lives on -- if only in spirit. Now, in 2025, this meeting of West Coast foes marks one of the most important Big Ten games left in the regular season. The conference title picture looks clear, with No. 1 Ohio State and No. 2 Indiana on track to meet in Indianapolis, but USC and Oregon remain firmly in the playoff hunt. For the Ducks, every game matters with potential first-round homefield advantage in play. The Trojans already have two losses, and they can't afford another if they want to stay in contention for an at-large bid.Pittsburgh at No. 16 Georgia Tech -- 7 p.m. on ESPN, fuboTV (try for free): Pittsburgh's CFP hopes tanked with its Week 12 loss to Notre Dame, but the Panthers can still reach the ACC Championship Game -- so the door isn't closed yet. To stay alive, they'll have to get past Georgia Tech. The Yellow Jackets, meanwhile, can punch their ticket to Charlotte with a win Saturday. They'll need to play far better than they did against hapless Boston College, and they can't afford to look ahead to next week's regular-season finale against No. 4 Georgia.\nNo. 11 BYU at Cincinnati -- 8 p.m. on Fox, fuboTV (try for free): BYU is hanging around as the first team out of the playoff. The Cougars also control their own destiny in the Big 12 race -- win their last two and they're in the conference title game. Cincinnati is stuck in the muddle of two-loss Big 12 teams, but the Bearcats aren't out of it yet. They need a win to keep their hopes alive, and they'll also need losses from Arizona State, Houston and Utah. Best of the rest Rutgers at No. 1 Ohio State -- noon on Fox, fuboTV (try for free)  No. 13 Miami at Virginia Tech -- noon on ESPN, fuboTV (try for free)  Louisville at SMU -- noon on ESPN2, fuboTV (try for free)   Tulsa at Army -- noon on CBS Sports Network, CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App Syracuse at No. 9 Notre Dame -- 3:30 p.m. on NBC, fuboTV (try for free)  Arkansas at No. 17 Texas -- 3:30 p.m. on ABC, fuboTV (try for free)  Duke at North Carolina -- 3:30 p.m. on ACC Network, fuboTV (try for free)  Jacksonville State at FIU -- 3:30 p.m. on CBS Sports Network, CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App Kansas State at No. 12 Utah -- 4 p.m. on ESPN2, fuboTV (try for free) No. 18 Michigan at Maryland -- 4 p.m. on Big Ten Network, fuboTV (try for free) \nTCU at No. 23 Houston -- 4  p.m. on Fox, fuboTV (try for free) New Mexico at Air Force -- 7 p.m. on CBS Sports Network, CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App   Nebraska at Penn State -- 7 p.m. on NBC, fuboTV (try for free) No. 20 Tennessee at Florida -- 7:30 p.m. on ABC, fuboTV (try for free)No. 25 Arizona State at Colorado -- 8 p.m. on ESPN2, fuboTV (try for free) Utah State at Fresno State -- 10:30 p.m. on CBS Sports Network, CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App\n            ",

Below, CBS Sports has gathered all of Friday's most notable news, moves, and murmurs in one convenient spot.Here's what's cooking across the league.Yankees in touch with star outfielders The Yankees have been in contact with free-agent outfielders Kyle Tucker and Cody Bellinger, among others, general manager Brian Cashman confirmed.\"We'd love to have Bellinger come back,\" Cashman told the media Thursday. \"Talked to [agent Scott] Boras yesterday about Belli and other free agents of his. Talked to Casey Close about his free agents; he's got Kyle Tucker, amongst others. That's the nature of the beast in the winter.\"\n        \n            \n                Kyle Tucker free agency: Pros and cons, contract prediction, landing spots and more for star outfielder\n                \n                    Matt Snyder                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTucker is the best free agent available, no matter the position. The Yankees are likely to face competition from the Blue Jays, Phillies, Dodgers, and other clubs if they give him serious pursuit. Meanwhile, Bellinger is a familiar face, having spent last season with the Yankees following an offseason trade with the Cubs. CBS Sports recently ranked him sixth in this winter's class.\nThe Yankees have already reunited with one outfielder this week, when Trent Grisham accepted the qualifying offer to return to New York on a one-year pact worth just more than $22 million.Twins add catcher in trade with OriolesThe Twins have bolstered their catching depth by acquiring veteran Alex Jackson from the Orioles in exchange for minor-league infielder Payton Eeles, the teams announced Friday.Jackson, 30 come December, is a veteran of parts of six big-league seasons. He could serve as the backup to Ryan Jeffers or perhaps in a timeshare if the Twins decide to deal Jeffers as part of their ongoing rebuild.\nJackson hit .220/.290/.473 (111 OPS+) last season with five home runs in 36 games.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        FRISCO, Texas -- The Dallas Cowboys shocked the football world Monday night when they didn't start CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens at the Las Vegas Raiders in Week 11 despite both being healthy. Their opening drive benching fueled plenty of speculation on social media about what \"Hangover\" type of shenanigans the two could have gotten into on the Las Vegas strip. Cowboys coach Bryan Schottenheimer said \"there were some things that were missed\" and kept his explanation at that. Both Lamb and Pickens declined to get into specifics postgame Monday night. However, Lamb told a group of reporters at his locker that he and Pickens were out past the team's 10 p.m. Pacific time curfew before Monday evening's game. The opening drive benching didn't impact the outcome, a 33-16 Cowboys victory in which Pickens exploded for 144 yards and a touchdown on nine catches with Lamb adding 66 yards and a touchdown on five catches. The duo had dinner and some drinks at Red Rock Casino Resort and Spa Las Vegas before returning to the Durango Resort around 20 minutes down the road. Lamb also clarified he didn't throw up at 7:30 a.m. on Monday morning, a rumor that was making the rounds on social media. \"I know how to hold my liquor,\" he said. Pickens initially said the Cowboys lined up in more run-heavy personnel to \"exploit\" the Raiders in the run game when CBS Sports asked him why he and Lamb didn't start the game. When he was informed Schottenheimer said he missed a couple things, he gave a short reply. \n\n        \n            \n                Cowboys' Dak Prescott 'humbled' to near passing Tony Romo as Dallas' all-time pass yards leader\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"That's just between me and Schotty honestly,\" Pickens said Monday. Pickens hasn't commented since on the reasons for the benching, but that disciplinary issue isn't gonna come between him and his head coach. Schottenheimer made a point to come over and hug Pickens and Lamb in the first quarter on Monday after Lamb scored the first touchdown of the game. \"I think we're still getting even closer and closer. We were close before, and I feel now we're getting even closer,\" Pickens said. ... \"Definitely with the types of plays and play calling. The stuff that he brings to the table, definitely a huge factor.\"  In fact, Schottenheimer would love to be both Lamb's and Pickens' play caller for years to come, something that is currently in the air with the latter's rookie contract set to expire in the coming offseason. \n\"Sign me up. I mean, what do you say? Those two guys, I just love their relationship, man. I love the firepower that they give us,\" Schottenheimer said on Tuesday. \"That's one of those games where you never know which one it's going to be. Some games it's both of them, some games it's one of them, and again, like I said, I pinch myself at times. Because when you're talking about you're Dak or the playcaller, like myself, you're like, OK, if we do this, which way do I throw it to? I like that matchup, but wow, that one is pretty good too. That's real. I'm very in favor of George having a long-term future with us.\"    \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Roster-building is cyclical. Teams with a lot of size and physicality seemingly always hit free agency trying to add some skill. Vice versa, the skilled teams are on the prowl for some athletes to survive. Round and round we go on the carousel.Often, it's just a guessing game on whether the newcomers can coalesce with the returners to fix the flaws. No one is expecting perfection or a finished product in November, but we're starting to get an early look at whether the offseason buzz was real or a smokescreen.\n    \n                                        \n    No. 3 UConnThe offseason pitch: The point guard room is drastically improved, which will make everything else fall into place.\nEarly return: UConn isn't at full-strength yet, but it's hard not to be optimistic about where this club is trending. Georgia transfer Silas Demary Jr. (13 points, 5.6 assists, 4.0 rebounds) and Dayton transfer Malachi Smith (5.6 points, 4.0 assists in 20 minutes) have picked up some of the intricacies of this offense quickly while buffing up UConn's point-of-attack defense in a real way. Get Tarris Reed and Braylon Mullins healthy, and Dan Hurley's club will be cooking with gas. This is going to be one of the best teams in America sooner rather than later, and the point guard play is a big reason why. Early grade: A\n    \n                                        \n    No. 12 KentuckyThe offseason pitch: This defense has the personnel to be top-10 good.Early return: Defensive continuity takes time, and Kentucky doesn't have it. Michigan State bludgeoned Kentucky for 1.17 points per possession. High-powered Louisville was operating in the 1.25 range against this Kentucky defense. Of course, Kentucky is missing maybe its best defender (big man Jayden Quaintance), but Denzel Aberdeen, Otega Oweh, Mo Dioubate and Malachi Moreno are talented individual defenders in their own right. Kentucky is making far too many scouting report mistakes right now, and frustrating shot selection on offense has also put this defense in bad binds. Michigan State scored 19 points in transition against the 'Cats, and Kentucky only notched two \"kills\" (three straight stops) against the Spartans. \nKentucky has stuff to clean up everywhere, but finding some competitive spirit and bite defensively would be a great start. Early grade: F\n    \n                                        \n    No. 16 Iowa StateThe offseason pitch: Now healthy, Tamin Lipsey will return to All-American status and drive this group to the top of the Big 12.Early return: So far, so good. Iowa State has manhandled three low-major clubs and waxed Mississippi State, 96-80. Lipsey has been pivotal to all of it. He already has as many 20-point performances (two) as all of last year, and the way he's operating is so encouraging. His burst is back. He looks far more comfortable getting to his pull-up in the middle of the floor, which was an area that defenses weren't forced to worry about with him a year ago. The all-everything senior guard supplies his usual Tamin Lipsey hustle, gritty, unselfish plays, this time paired with a jolt of extra shot-making. This healthy version of Lipsey is exactly what T.J. Otzelberger predicted in the preseason and makes the Cyclones a real factor to make noise in next week's Players Era Festival tournament. Early grade: A\n\n    \n                                        \n    No. 18 North CarolinaThe offseason pitch: The renovated frontcourt provides more stability and will help us play like North Carolina again. Early return: Arizona transfer Henri Veesaar and five-star freshman Caleb Wilson have quickly looked the part of maybe the ACC's best big man pairing. Duke may have something to say about that eventually, but the Wilson-Veesaar duo has provided just about everything you could ask for. North Carolina has the best two-point defense in all of college basketball throughout the first two weeks. Veesaar and Wilson may not be brute-force, space-eaters, but they make up for it with incredible mobility, length and speed. Both have relentless motors, and the big-to-big passing has been a real asset for North Carolina's offense.Stiff challenges are on the way, but UNC's frontcourt is a breath of fresh air. Early grade: A\n\n    \n                                        \n    No. 25 N.C StateThe offseason pitch: This isn't a rebuild.Early return: Will Wade has wasted no time stacking dubs in Raleigh. The Wolfpack is off to a 4-0 start, including an impressive romp over UAB and a gritty victory over a hard-nosed VCU club.This roster is so clearly ahead of the curve. Paying up for Darrion Williams was unequivocally the right move. The prized Texas Tech transfer has wasted no time dissuading any concerns about whether he could operate as the alpha of an offense. The decision to keep Paul McNeil, who was recruited by the previous regime, looks like a no-brainer now. All the consternation about NC State's interior size after losing big man Paul Mbiya to Kansas looks a bit overblown. 6-10 big man Musa Sagnia is so clearly going to help this club a ton with his activity on the boards and mobility defensively. When NC State needed a stop against VCU, it pivoted to a hybrid zone defense with Sagnia flying around at the top of the pressure. He's an asset, not a deep bench stash. This team also has edgy veterans like Tre Holloman and Quadir Copeland, who give 'em some nastiness, and freshman Matt Able has a gorgeous shooting stroke. Wade was right. This isn't a rebuild. You will hear from the 'Pack in the ACC race. Early grade: A\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Josh Allen showed plenty of frustration during Buffalo's 23-19 loss to the Houston Texans on Thursday night and it's easy to understand why: He was sacked a career-high eight times and he also threw two interceptions. As bad as the sacks and interceptions were, there was one specific play that seemed to frustrate Allen more than anything and that was a failed fourth-and-1 in the fourth quarter. With just over 10 minutes left to play in the game, the Bills were trailing 23-16 and they had the ball at Houston's 23-yard line. With the team facing a fourth-and-1, Bills coach Sean McDermott decided to go for it, and the decision immediately blew up in his face when James Cook got stopped cold for a two-yard loss on the pivotal play. As you can see below, Cook had no chance. \nAfter the fourth down failure, Allen headed to the sideline and he definitely didn't look happy. He sat on the bench next to backup quarterback Mitchell Trubisky and appeared to say \"What are we doing?\"\nFollowing the game, Allen was asked about his sideline interaction with Trubisky and he admitted that he was extremely frustrated. \n\"Just frustration on my part,\" Allen said. \"In a situation like that, probably should have just banged a timeout. We got the play in late. Didn't give ourselves a chance there.\"That's a short answer, but there's a lot to dig into here. For one, Allen suggests that the team should have called a timeout, which is a poor reflection on McDermott, who didn't recognize that a timeout might be the best option there. Allen also said that that play came in late, which isn't a good look for offensive coordinator Joe Brady. Someone on the Bills' sideline probably should have realized that the offense was in total disarray just before the fourth down play and responded by calling a timeout. \nHere's what happened leading up to the play that caused so much confusion for Buffalo: 1. James Cook appeared to be gassed. Just before the fourth-and-1 play, Cook ran the ball on third down, which was the fourth straight play where he had carried the ball. Cook ran for 20 yards to get a first down at Houston's 32-yard line. He then had a 3-yard run, a 5-yard run and a 1-yard run to set up Buffalo's fourth-and-1. After the third down play, it was pretty clear that Cook was gassed and he started to walk off the field. James Cook was walking off the field just before Buffalo's fourth-and-1 attempt.  At this point, the Bills should have called a play that didn't involve him or taken a timeout to give him a break, as Allen suggested. \n2. After briefly going to the sideline, Cook eventually returned to the game, but he didn't get to the huddle until there were just 20 seconds left on the play clock. And let's not forget, the play call came in late here and it appears Allen was still trying to figure out what the call was with just 18 seconds left on the play clock. The Bills struggled to get their fourth down play in.  At this point, the offense is now rushed, which is not what you want on fourth down. In the end, the play call ended up going to Cook, who didn't even want to be on the field for the play, because he wanted a chance to catch his breath. Like Allen said, this would have been the perfect spot for a timeout, but the Bills didn't take one, and their fourth down play never had a chance. Later in the quarter, the Bills ending up pulling off one of the most improbable plays of the NFL season when they converted a fourth-and-27, but since they lost, that's probably not the fourth down play that Allen is going to remember from the game. Instead, the Bills star quarterback is likely going to remember his frustrations from the fourth-and-1. \nThe Bills had actually converted a fourth-and-1 earlier in the game with Allen jumping over the pile, but Brady decided not to go that route again. \nAllen threw for 253 yards in the game, but he totaled zero touchdowns against the Texans in a performance that came five days after he totaled six touchdowns in a 44-32 win over the Buccaneers. It was definitely a frustrating loss for Allen, but he didn't pin the blame on anyone except for himself. \n\"I have to be better with throwing the ball away, living to see another down, letting us play some situational football and pinning them deep,\" Allen said. \"Too many times, I was going backwards, and I have to be better on that.\"Allen lost a total of 70 yards on the eight sacks that he took, and his interceptions were both costly. Allen's biggest problem might just be playing in Houston. The Bills quarterback is now 0-4 in his career when playing at NRG Stadium. Allen had been undefeated on Thursday nights (8-0) going into Week 12, but that unbeaten streak is now over after the Bills' stunning loss. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Pittsburgh Pirates secured the No. 1 overall pick in the 2023 MLB Draft thanks in part to a 100-loss season in 2022. I say \"in part\" because the Pirates actually didn't have the worst record in baseball that year. It was the first time ever that MLB used a draft lottery and the Pirates were the first ever winners.Their prize was just about as good as it could get. Out of LSU, a big, right-handed pitcher named Paul Skenes was selected. He cruised through the minors and debuted in the majors on May 11, 2024, less than a year after the draft. No exaggeration, Skenes has been one of the best pitchers in baseball since his arrival. Through two seasons with a bad Pirates team, he's gone 21-13 with a 1.96 ERA, 0.95 WHIP and 386 strikeouts against 74 walks in 320 ⅔ innings. He's had a sub-2.00 ERA in each season. He won the Rookie of the Year last year and Cy Young this year, the latter unanimously.Oh, and he's still only 23 years old. His birthday isn't until late May.\nBut still, there are whispers about the Pirates trading Skenes. Sometimes louder than whispers.\nPirates general manager Ben Cherington touched on it at the general managers meetings last week. \"It's always respectful. Teams have to ask the question, right?\" Cherington said. \"I suspect that won't end. But the answer has been consistent. \"Paul Skenes is going to be a Pirate in 2026.\"He should listen. Cherington's job is to listen. That doesn't mean he'll make a deal or that he should. So, let's run through this with the pros and cons of trading one of baseball's biggest superstars. \nCons of trading SkenesSkenes is one of the best pitchers in baseball. I already said as much. Why would you want to trade one of the best pitchers? To hopefully get back a pitcher or two that might be as good someday? Why hope for the best when you already have the sure thing? Skenes is entering his age-24 season, hasn't been overworked and is a physically huge human being with an incredibly strong arm. Every single pitcher carries inherent injury risk, but compared to others, Skenes sure feels less risky than the ordinary pitcher, doesn't he? Further, Skenes is under team control through 2029. He doesn't even enter his arbitration years until 2027. He's cheap right now, which means this is the time for the Pirates to commit to spending money around him. He's the franchise centerpiece. Act like it. They should have already done it, but it's not too late.\nRight now, the Pirates have an estimated payroll for next season of $60.1 million. The offseason isn't close to being over yet, but it's pathetic to even see that figure right now. There are good players available in free agency, so go build around Skenes by spending some money. For those who think the Pirates can't afford more, USA Today reported the following last May: The Pittsburgh Pirates, according to information received by the players union and confirmed by several owners, are one of the most profitable teams in all of baseball, stashing a huge chunk of their revenue sharing monies instead of investing in their team year after year.It lines up with what's been apparent for years. Pirates ownership is just getting more rich off the team instead of trying to win. Yes, there's revenue sharing from the so-called rich teams. The Pirates just pocket a portion of it instead of spending on the product for the fans, despite the latter being the intended goal of revenue sharing. The Pirates don't look in horrible shape with their pitching staff heading toward next year. Skenes is a top-shelf ace. Mitch Keller is a fine mid-rotation guy. There's promise in Braxton Ashcraft and Bubba Chandler. Jared Jones will return from his elbow surgery at some point. They have some more prospect help coming, too, in Hunter Barco and Thomas Harrington. The offense is another matter. It was atrocious last year and there's very little help coming from inside the organization. There are some good free-agent hitters. Do the math. \nNow, someone might claim that trading Skenes for offensive help would make sense, but the problem is Skenes still does heavy lifting in making that rotation look respectable. Keller isn't an ace and while there's promise elsewhere on the staff, there are also tons of question marks. Skenes is an ace and a sure thing. He has to stay.Finally, trading Skenes just a few years after taking him first overall sends a message that this isn't a serious organization. Kicking the proverbial can down the street for another few years says what to the fan base, let alone to the rest of baseball? We're perpetually rebuilding. If there's never contention on the table, what's the point of the fans sticking around? They'd be running a veritable minor-league operation, doing so while playing against major-league competition. \nThe optics of the move would be just as bad as the move would be for the baseball team. Both would be pitiful and embarrassing.Pros of trading SkenesI guess there's an argument that a trade package for Skenes could be monstrous. If the Pirates were guaranteed to get back something like five stud players for the future, why not? And if you strike now before Skenes even hits arbitration, that means the offers would be higher than they'll be in the ensuing few seasons. Each year that Skenes gets closer to free agency (and more expensive, the smaller the return.The problem is that when you're talking about prospects, nothing is guaranteed, as noted above. \nFor me, realistically, there are no pros to trading Skenes. Even the discussion is an insult to the fan base and if it starts happening from the front office -- meaning it's likely coming from ownership -- there should be a full-on revolt. Bob Nutting has already disrespected the fan base for long enough, and those fans don't need to deal with this on top of everything else.You keep Paul Skenes and build a winner around him.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        There are just seven more weeks remaining in the 2025 NFL regular season, and these division races are getting pretty tight. The Buffalo Bills, who fell to the Houston Texans on Thursday night, remain a couple of games back of the New England Patriots in the AFC East, the Baltimore Ravens are right on the heels of the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC North, and then it's anyone's race when it comes to the NFC North and NFC West.This week, Patrick Mahomes and the 5-5 Kansas City Chiefs host Daniel Jones and the Indianapolis Colts, the Dallas Cowboys welcome Jalen Hurts and the Philadelphia Eagles to AT&T Stadium and the Los Angeles Rams play the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on \"Sunday Night Football.\" It's sure to be another wild week in the NFL. Which teams should you pick in Week 12, and which should you fade? CBS Sports writers Jordan Dajani and Jared Dubin are here to break down the biggest games of the weekend. For clarity, lines for these selections were taken on Nov. 19, via FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users can get $300 in bonus bets:Pittsburgh Steelers at Chicago Bears (-2.5)\nDajani (Bears -2.5): My Steelers colleague Bryan DeArdo was trying to make the case to me this week that Mason Rudolph should start over Aaron Rodgers for the remainder of the season. I'm not sure I agree with that, but Rodgers hasn't played well in recent weeks and is now dealing with a small fracture in his wrist. The Bears aren't legitimate contenders and couldn't cover the spread last week, even with J.J. McCarthy missing virtually every throw. But I'll take Chicago with the number under a field goal …  Prediction: Bears 23, Steelers 17\nDubin (Bears -2.5): You're not going to get me to pick Mason Rudolph on the road. And if it's Aaron Rodgers playing with a broken wrist, I'm not sure you can get me to take that, either. … Prediction: Bears 24, Steelers 13Minnesota Vikings at Green Bay Packers (-6.5)\nDajani (Vikings +6.5): Which team do you have more faith in? The Vikings or Packers? That's a tough question. J.J. McCarthy is the first quarterback to throw an interception in five straight games to begin a career since Zach Wilson in 2021, and he had his own fans booing last week, while the Packers have lost back-to-back home games and really haven't looked good since Week 8. I'll take the Packers to win this game, but I'm wondering if 6.5 points is too much. McCarthy is 2-0 SU and ATS in his career on the road, so I'm calling a back-door cover  …  Prediction: Packers 24, Vikings 20Dubin (Vikings +6.5): The Packers have been playing up or down to their level of competition all season, and I see no reason to think that won't continue here. I trust Brian Flores to scheme up a defense that puts Green Bay in some bad situations, and I'm not sure how much I trust the Packers to respond with a good performance. But do you know what I trust even less than that? The J.J. McCarthy-led Vikings offense. Especially against a Green Bay front that will put him under heavy pressure. … Prediction: Packers 20, Vikings 14\nIndianapolis Colts at Kansas City Chiefs (-3.5)\nDajani (Chiefs -3.5): I guarantee many of you were shocked to see this line, and probably think Colts +3.5 is an auto bet. Not so fast. Yes, I would rather have this number under a field goal, but I'm going to lay the points with the home favorites. The Chiefs are 4-1 at home this season and 1-4 on the road. Patrick Mahomes has NEVER lost three straight regular-season starts. As for Daniel Jones, it's worth noting that he has committed seven turnovers in the last two games, losing to the Steelers and then playing a close game with the lowly Atlanta Falcons. Are the Colts trending in the wrong direction? …  Prediction: Chiefs 26, Colts 20Dubin (Chiefs -3.5): Oh, look, I'm taking the Chiefs again despite the fact that they keep failing me. Yes, I am going to go down with the ship on this one. If Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reid lose to Daniel Jones and Co. at home, then I am perfectly fine feeling silly about having taken them in the first place. I can't see the Chiefs losing three in a row in this spot.  … Prediction: Chiefs 31, Colts 26Cleveland Browns at Las Vegas Raiders (-3.5)\nDajani (Browns +3.5): The Shedeur Sanders talk is tiring at this point. We have one side gloating about the fact that he had one of the worst debuts in NFL history, while the other side is talking about how a backup quarterback should have taken first-team reps in practice. I'm going to pick the Raiders to win by exactly three points. To me, Sanders' most negative tendency is that he holds the ball too long. That's just simply something you can't do in the NFL. However, Geno Smith's offensive line stinks, and Myles Garrett will have three sacks. There's a part of me that's excited for this game, but it's going to be gross  …  Prediction: Raiders 17, Browns 14\nDubin (Raiders -3.5): The Browns are a different team on the road than they are at home. Seriously: they've allowed a maximum of 23 points in their home games and have given up 23 or more in every game away from home. The Raiders are bad, but I'm not sure the Browns can field a viable offense against a Raiders defense that was actually playing well before getting lit up by the Cowboys on Monday night to beat the Raiders on the road.  … Prediction: Raiders 20, Browns 10Philadelphia Eagles (-3.5) at Dallas Cowboys\nDajani (Cowboys +3.5): I'm a sucker for the home dog with the hook in a divisional matchup. This will be the Cowboys' first home game following the tragic passing of Marshawn Kneeland, and I know the fans are going to show out. Quinnen Williams and Kenny Clark are capable of slowing down Saquon Barkley, while CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens can find separation vs. this secondary. Keep in mind that Lane Johnson has a Lisfranc injury and Cam Jurgens is currently in concussion protocol. Cowboys keep it close  …  Prediction: Eagles 24, Cowboys 21Dubin (Eagles -3.5): Philadelphia's defense is playing at such a high level right now that I can overlook what is happening to the Eagles offensively. Even if A.J. Brown can't, the Dallas offense is spectacular, but the Lions offense that the Eagles just shut down is pretty spectacular, too. What's to say they can't at least hold Dak Prescott, CeeDee Lamb, George Pickens and Co. in check? Is the Cowboys' defense better now than it was pre-trade deadline? Sure. But you can still throw all over them. I think the Eagles finally get something of a passing attack going here.  … Prediction: Eagles 24, Cowboys 20\nTampa Bay Buccaneers at Los Angeles Rams (-6.5) (SNF)\nDajani (Rams -6.5): Despite the win over the Seattle Seahawks, I think the Rams are out to set the record straight about their offense. Matthew Stafford and Co. converted just two third downs, and were out-gained by Seattle, 414 yards to 249. The Buccaneers are 1-7 in prime time with Baker Mayfield at quarterback, and I have concerns about this Bucs defense after watching last week's loss against the Bills ...     Prediction: Rams 27, Buccaneers 20Dubin (Buccaneers +6.5): The Buccaneers always seem to find a way to score -- even against the best defenses, of which the Rams are one. But their own defense is a significant pass funnel (i.e., it's easier to throw against them than it is to run), and that's dangerous against a team with Matthew Stafford playing at as high a level as he's hit in nearly every game this year. I think the Rams win this one, but the Bucs, as is their wont, either keep it close or find a way to backdoor into a cover.  … Prediction: Rams 31, Bucs 26Carolina Panthers at San Francisco 49ers (-7) (MNF)\nDajani (49ers -7): Do we still have a quarterback controversy in San Francisco? Brock Purdy put up a season-high 41 points in his return to the lineup this past week. Bryce Young, on the other hand, is one of the toughest quarterbacks to figure out. He will look helpless against the New Orleans Saints one week, and then put up a franchise-record 448 passing yards against the No. 1 pass defense the next. Ultimately, I think the 49ers have more firepower than the Panthers. Plus, this is Christian McCaffrey's first game against his former team! How could you not take the 49ers at home in this situation?  …  Prediction: 49ers 31, Panthers 20\nDubin (49ers -7): The Niners looked great in Brock Purdy's return to the field last week, and as Dajani mentioned, that was against a better defense than the one they'll face on Monday night. I know the Panthers finally figured out a way to throw the ball all over the yard themselves last week, but that's still an aberration when it comes to their season-long performance. If San Francisco can hold Rico Dowdle in check, I think the Niners should roll.  … Prediction: 49ers 27, Panthers 16\n            ",

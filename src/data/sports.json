    "body": "\n        Teams on opposite sides of the AFC North standings meet in the nightcap of the 2025 NFL Thanksgiving schedule when the Baltimore Ravens host the Cincinnati Bengals. The Ravens are tied atop the division with the Steelers, and currently hold the tiebreaker. Cincinnati, meanwhile, is tied with the Browns at the bottom of the division, but the Bengals will have receiver Ja'Marr Chase back from suspension and quarterback Joe Burrow (toe) back in the lineup. Kickoff is at 8:20 p.m. ET from Baltimore. Baltimore is a 7-point favorite in the Bengals vs. Ravens odds, while the over/under is 51.5. Before making any Ravens vs. Bengals picks, be sure to see what the SportsLine projection model has to say. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets instantly if your bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

Jackson (toe) missed practice on Monday, but was a full participant on Tuesday. They're 3-2 against the spread during that five-game span, but just missed two covers that would've put them on a 5-0 ATS run. Jackson's improved health has certainly been a factor in the run, but the defense is also playing much better. Since an embarrassing 44-10 loss to the Texans on Oct. 5, no team has cleared 20 points against Baltimore. The Bengals are getting healthier, but have ruled out Tee Higgins (concussion) for this one. Burrow being sharp after such a long layoff isn't a foregone conclusions either, so Baltimore has a clear path to a win and cover. See which team to back at SportsLine.New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states:Why the Bengals can coverHaving Burrow back under center certainly makes this a much more competitive matchup. Cincinnati didn't blink against the powerful Patriots in Week 12 either, losing 26-20 and staying within the 7.5-point spread. Now the Bengals get their two-time Pro Bowl quarterback under center, along with Chase back in the lineup following last week's suspension. Baltimore's offense scored just 23 points in each of the past two weeks against two of the league's worst teams -- the Browns and Jets -- giving Cincinnati a chance to keep this game competitive and within the number. See which team to back at SportsLine. Check out the latest BetMGM promo code CBSSPORTS, where new users can get up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses.How to make Ravens vs. Bengals picksFor Bengals vs. Ravens on Thanksgiving, the model is leaning Over the total, projecting 53 combined points.

    "body": "\n        The Thanksgiving NFL games are amongst the most watched on a yearly basis, and that should certainly be the case with the middle matchup of Thursday's slate. It has Dak Prescott and the Dallas Cowboys hosting Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce and the Kansas City Chiefs. Dallas (5-5-1) is coming off 24-21 comeback victory over Philadelphia on Sunday, and the Cowboys are 34-22-1 all-time on Thanksgiving. Kansas City (6-5) toppled Indianapolis, 23-20, in Week 12 and will be part of the NFL Thanksgiving tradition for the first time since 2006, going 5-5 all-time on Turkey Day. Offensive lineman Trey Smith (ankle) and tight end Noah Gray (concussion) have both been ruled out for Kansas City.Kickoff is from AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, at 4:30 p.m. ET on CBS and Paramount+. The Cowboys have won five straight home matchups against the Chiefs. Kansas City is the 3.5-point favorite in the latest Chiefs vs. Cowboys odds, while the over/under for total points is 52.5.

Kareem Hunt ran for over 100 yards versus what was the No. 5 run defense, while Indy's Jonathan Taylor -- who leads the NFL in both rushing yards and touchdowns -- was held to just 58 yards on the ground and kept out of the endzone. As for Mahomes, the native Texan should relish his first pro game in Dallas as he gets to face the Cowboys' No. 30 pass defense as the Chiefs look to improve to 4-1 ATS versus NFC opponents this year. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why the Cowboys can coverIt's been over 50 years since the Chiefs won in Dallas, as the Cowboys have prevailed in their last five home games versus Kansas City. Additionally, the Cowboys have won three straight Thanksgiving Day games, with a 16.7-point average margin of victory in them. Despite Andy Reid, Mahomes and Kelce being on the other sideline, it's the Cowboys who will have the best offense on the field as they rank first in yards and fourth in scoring. Additionally, the Cowboys should be able to take advantage of a team which has gotten a little sloppy as of late as the Chiefs have as many turnovers (six) over their last four games as they had over their previous 18 regular season games. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Cowboys vs. Chiefs picksFor the NFL Week 13 game of Chiefs vs. Cowboys, the model is leaning Under the total.

Lions vs. Packers (+2.5) kicks things off at 1 p.m. ET, followed by Cowboys vs. Chiefs (-3) at 4:30 p.m. ET, with Ravens vs. Bengals (+7) the 8:20 p.m. ET nightcap. Joe Burrow (toe) has been cleared to return in that one, though receiver Tee Higgins (concussion) has been ruled out. One could make an NFL parlay using those spreads, or incorporate picks on the total, with the money line, or by inserting NFL props. Baltimore enters in on a five-game winning streak this season, and it's won four straight versus Cincinnati, making the Ravens an attractive option with your Thanksgiving NFL parlay.As for those prop bets you could include, there is no shortage of stars to target, including Burrow, Jahmyr Gibbs, Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce, Dak Prescott and a well-rested Ja'Marr Chase, who is coming off a one-game suspension. Prescott has multiple touchdown passes in five straight Thanksgiving Day games, but Kansas City has given up just 11 passing scores across 11 games this year. He has an over/under of 1.5 passing TDs versus the Chiefs, with NFL prop odds of -132 for the Over and an intriguing plus-money payout of +100 for the Under.

Not only has Baltimore won four straight versus Cincy, but the Ravens sport a 4-1 ATS record over their last five meetings. This season, Baltimore's defense is back to being elite as it has kept six straight opponents under 20 points, including a pair of top-10 scoring offenses in the Rams and Bears. Even with Burrow's expected return, the Bengals offense isn't on that level, especially with Tee Higgins (concussion), expected to be out. Cincinnati's defense, meanwhile, is the worst in the NFL.The Bengals rank dead last in points allowed, yards allowed and passing defense, while working second-to-last in run defense and third-down defense. A lack of taking the ball away plays a big part in those rankings as Cincy has forced only one turnover, total, over its last four games, while Baltimore has nine takeaways over its last four. With these discrepancies, Baltimore is projected to win by double-digits and cover in well over 50% of simulations in an A-rated spread pick. See which other NFL parlay picks to make here, and bet the Ravens to cover here:How to make Thanksgiving NFL parlaysThe model also jumped on three other NFL picks, including a player prop that returns plus money. You can only see the model's Thanksgiving NFL best bets and NFL parlay at SportsLine.What are the model's top NFL picks, and which Thanksgiving Day NFL bets should you target for an epic 11-1 payout?

That means that Kelly will receive the entirely of his $54 million buyout as long as he fulfills his obligation to find another job. The letter reportedly details Kelly's responsibility to mitigate the buyout, which includes making \"good-faith, reasonable and sustained efforts to obtain\" employment. LSU expects Kelly to \"maintain reasonable documentation\" of his job search that includes interviews and offers. Kelly and LSU's breakup has been contentious. Kelly recently filed a lawsuit over the buyout situation to get the full $54 million he is contractually owed. LSU responded by stating that then-athletic director Scott Woodward didn't have the authority to fire Kelly, whose attorneys sent the school a letter which claimed that dragging out the firing process has hurt his ability to find a new employment. \nLSU had initially wanted to negotiate the buyout terms with Kelly and had been looking into whether they could fire Kelly for cause to avoid paying the buyout. Kelly's attorneys had insisted the school missed the window to do so. Kelly, 64, was fired last month following LSU's 49-25 loss to Texas A&M, an unceremonious end to what was a disappointing run for a man who is also the winningest coach in Notre Dame history. While the Tigers went 34-14 (that included a 3-0 record in bowl games) under Kelly's watch, they never finished a season ranked higher than 18th in the country. LSU finished outside of the top-25 last season and was 5-3 at the time of Kelly's firing. \nSince firing Kelly, the Tigers have gone 2-1 under interim coach Frank Wilson. After dropping their first game without Kelly, a 20-9 loss to Alabama, the Tigers have come back with consecutive wins over Arkansas and Western Kentucky to improve their record to 7-4 entering Saturday's regular season finale against No. 8 Oklahoma. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Toronto Blue Jays have reached an agreement with free-agent right-hander Dylan Cease on a seven-year pact worth $210 million, according to the New York Post. The Blue Jays have not yet announced the signing, but when they do it will become the largest free-agent contract ever handed out by the franchise, topping George Springer's six-year agreement worth $150 million. Cease, who turns 30 next month, is fresh off a disappointing season. He posted a 4.55 ERA (94 ERA+) and a 3.03 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 32 starts with the San Diego Padres. Cease's arsenal continued to grade favorably, however, leading CBS Sports to rank him as the 11th-best free agent available. Here's what we wrote:Here's one for the dip buyers. Cease notched his fifth campaign in a row with 32 or more starts but, despite underlying data that bore resemblance to his past efforts, posted the worst full-season ERA+ of his career. Teams may ask themselves: what was going on with his slider? Cease is a two-pitch pony (fastballs and sliders combined for a usage rate over 80%), yet he tinkered with his top breaker, throwing it harder with less depth and sweep. His results were worse, suggesting he should revert. True in one way, true in multiple ways.Cease's contract is tied for the seventh largest free-agent deal ever given to a starting pitcher. He will join a Blue Jays rotation that figures to also include Kevin Gausman, rookie sensation Trey Yesavage, José Berríos, and Shane Bieber, who opted in to his contract earlier this winter. \nToronto won the American League pennant and AL East in 2025, falling two outs short against the Dodgers of their first World Series title since 1993.Here are three other things to know about this deal.\n1. Fourth richest contract among active pitchersOnce pen is put to paper, Cease will become one of the highest paid pitchers in the sport, as judged by total value. Do not that the list below excludes Shohei Ohtani on the grounds that he's a two-way player.Dodgers RHP Yoshinobu Yamamoto: $325MYankees RHP Gerrit Cole:                     $324M Yankees LHP Max Fried:                       $218M Blue Jays RHP Dylan Cease: $210M Diamondbacks RHP Corbin Burnes:                 $210MIt's worth pointing out that Cease's contract doesn't rank as highly when judged by average annual value. Then he falls to sixth behind Zack Wheeler, Jacob deGrom, Blake Snell, Cole, and Burnes, so far a multi-year contracts go. (Seth Lugo also has him beat if one-year deals are taken into consideration.)2. Why the Blue Jays chose Cease over Valdez, othersA fair question to ask in the wake of this signing is, well, why Cease? If the Blue Jays were deadset on adding a free-agent starter, why didn't they opt instead for left-hander Framber Valdez, Ranger Suárez, or any of the other free-agent options available to them.The Blue Jays will probably never provide the actual answer, but it seems reasonable to guess that it's because Cease is the most dynamic pitcher of the bunch. Indeed, he's struck out nearly 11 batters per nine innings for his career, as compared to Valdez's 8.9 and Suárez's 8.3 figures.\nAs an added bonus, Cease will add variety to a Blue Jays rotation that ranked 14th in the majors in strikeout rate. Rest assured, that won't be the case with him in tow.3. Good sign for other startersEven with the above subheading taken into consideration, you can bet that Valdez and other starters are tickled to see Cease's contract come in high.That's because the free-agent market is largely based on precedent. The agents for those pitchers can now argue that if Cease received this much, their client ought to receive at least the same.\nObviously that argument isn't guaranteed to end in a similarly lucrative contract. But those players and their agents have a better leg to stand on when they're making them now than they did coming into the week.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        LONDON -- You don't have to believe the bookmakers' odds. You can plead ignorance to Elo ratings. You might even choose to skip over all the tables that rank teams by how good they are at accruing points from football matches. You cannot, however, avoid the evidence that is clear to see in front of your eyes.Arsenal are the best team in the world right now. Of course they are. They've just done what the best team in Europe does, grinding one of their leading rivals into submission. Bayern Munich were lucky to only have three hung on them. Their goal, which was shaping up to be a consolation within 10 minutes of its scoring, required them to enact by far the most impressive attacking move of the match.A team who've just won on the road to the European champions routinely needed moments of peerless individual brilliance or a move where every component touch and player was 90th percentile. That was just to get into the penalty area. Bayern ended this game with their customary 60% possession. They also ended with nine touches in the Arsenal box. Harry Kane, whose presence only became apparent when the Emirates Stadium serenaded him, ended this game with fewer penalty box touches than Jurrien Timber.Bayern tried a lot and a lot of it was unsuccessful. Take the period before their out-of-the-blue equalizer, when Vincent Kompany appeared to conclude that his side just weren't going to get the better of their opponents in one-on-one duels. And so their positioning went deliberately haywire for a few passages. No matter when Konrad Laimer started moonlighting upfront or Kane did the whole England at a major tournament trick of abandoning the frontline. If Bukayo Saka had to play center back then Bukayo Saka played center back. William Saliba would charge forward and why not? He was as well off winning the ball in the Bayern third as Arsenal's.\n\"Individually, we were immense to resolve all the challenges that this team brings to the table,\" said Arteta. \"The energy that we created in the stadium, what the team transmits, the energy that we bring, the quality that we play with: it's incredible. We have to maintain that because it's still very early.\"Right the way through this game, the Arsenal machine was operating at peak efficiency. They have long since adapted to life without a center forward, on this occasion, rather than exploiting Mikel Merino's box-crashing qualities, they let him step back closer to Eberechi Eze and the indomitable triple pivot of Martin Zubimendi and two Declan Rices (wait, what?). Arteta wasn't looking to control possession, his side could control the positioning of Bayern even when they didn't have the ball at their feet. The center backs moved up and that created angles for the Gunners' wide men to fly into.That was what was so remarkable about this game. You wouldn't quite call it an off-finishing night from the hosts, who got three goals from 12 shots worth 2.72 xG, but they could have had more. Leandro Trossard's lob shot-cross produced nothing from a prime position. Had Eze shot when he passed in the first half, he might well have had a goal to follow up his derby hat trick. Even on an off night, Saka snapped on the heels of Bayern defenders, nearly forcing more than one prime shooting opportunity.\nThis was the best Arsenal have been in Arteta's tenure. Usually when a team reaches this level, everything has broken their way. They are not, for instance, down to their last Gabriel -- both Magalhaes and Jesus still working their way back to fitness. They have not played their last four and a half games without any center forward. Their captain, the technical heartbeat of their team, has played more than 266 minutes. The best team in the world doesn't lose its form attacker before half time and rip Bayern Munich to pieces. And yet here Arsenal were, having to adapt to the early exit of Trossard. No trouble, his replacement Noni Madueke delivered his first goal in the second half. This team may only just be emerging from a sustained run of difficulty with injuries but Arteta still has the strength in depth to turn the game, Riccardo Calafiori delivering the assist for Madueke with his first touch before fellow substitute Martinelli beat Manuel Neuer to Eze's ball over the top and tapped in. Now, of course, Bayern had selection issues of their own, a suspended Luis Diaz and injuries to Alphonso Davies and Jamal Musiala, but Kompany has not been bequeathed the strength in depth that Arteta has.The Arsenal boss would doubtless rather park the warm notices he and his players get. His press conference was notably taciturn for a man who has blitzed an opponent he labelled \"the best team in Europe.\" He would have no truck with questions as to what that made the side who just beat them. Kompany reflected why his counterpart was so taciturn. \n\"Mikel won't mind if I say, we had this discussion when we played PSG three or four weeks ago. I don't think any of us want to be the best team in November,\" he said. Perhaps in six months' time the status quo will have changed. Plug better fullbacks into the Bayern XI, not least a full fit Davies, and they could become a better defensive force. If Paris Saint-Germain find the fitness they had in the last run in, then they will not fear Arsenal.As Arteta himself put it, this is \"just the beginning.\" That might be an attempt to dampen expectations, but unfortunately for him, it might only serve to raise them. Right now, Arsenal are the best in the field. And they're only just getting started.\n            ",

Rendon, who missed the entire 2025 season after undergoing hip surgery in February, is expected to retire if a deal can be reached.Rendon, 35, agreed to a seven-year pact worth $245 million after winning the 2019 World Series as a member of the Washington Nationals. At the time, he was rightly viewed as one of the best at his position. In the preceding four seasons, he had averaged 26 home runs, 100 runs batted in, and a .912 OPS. His contributions had been worth an estimated 22.9 Wins Above Replacement, per the calculations housed at Baseball Reference.\nYet that version of Rendon rarely showed up for the Angels, instead dealing with constant injuries that, in recent years, required operations on both hips. To wit, Rendon had notched just 3.9 WAR in 257 games since joining the Angels. That works out to fewer than 43 games per campaign (though, to be fair, he did appear 52 of the Angels' 60 games during the pandemic-shortened 2020 season). \nAngels general manager Perry Minasian revealed in October that Rendon had yet to resume baseball activities -- a less-than-promising sign for his chances of returning to the active roster.ESPN's report indicates that if the Angels and Rendon can agree to terms on a buyout, part of the arrangement is expected to see him defer some of the money owed to him. That would, in turn, create additional financial flexibility for the Angels to deploy this winter.\nIn Rendon's absence last season, the Angels started Yoán Moncada and Luis Rengifo more than 50 times apiece at the hot corner. Both Moncada and Rengifo are now free agents. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        One of the biggest nonconference games of the 2025-26 college basketball season will take place on Thanksgiving when No. 4 Duke faces No. 22 Arkansas on CBS. This will mark the second consecutive year that the Razorbacks play on Thanksgiving on CBS. Illinois defeated Arkansas 90-77 last year on Thanksgiving.This matchup will feature some of the best freshmen in the country on the same court. The headliner of this game is Duke forward Cameron Boozer, who is a projected top-three pick in the 2026 NBA Draft. On the other side, Arkansas has two potential lottery picks in Meleek Thomas and Darius Acuff Jr.Duke is off to a 7-0 start for the first time since the 2021-22 campaign. The Blue Devils are looking to start a season 8-0 for the first time since the 2017-18 season, a year in which Duke reached the Elite Eight.Arkansas is off to a 5-1 start in Year 2 of the John Calipari era, with the lone loss coming to Michigan State earlier this month. The Razorbacks are 4-9 against ACC competition since the start of the 2014-15 season.\nHere is everything you need to know ahead of the marquee matchup. Where to watch Duke vs. Arkansas live  Date: Thursday, Nov. 27 | Time: 8 p.m. ETLocation: United Center -- ChicagoTV: CBS [Channel finder] Live stream: CBSSports.com | Mobile: CBS Sports AppDuke vs. Arkansas: Need to knowDuke could have the No. 1 pick, again: The race for the No. 1 pick in the 2026 NBA Draft will likely be between three players: Boozer, Kansas' Darryn Peterson and BYU's AJ Dybansta. While Boozer will be drafted behind those players this summer, he is off to an incredible start to the season and is on track to become the latest member of the Duke program to be drafted in the top three. Last season, Cooper Flagg won National Player of the Year as a freshman and became the No. 1 overall pick. Through three weeks, Boozer should be in the conversation for both.Coach Cal has two elite freshmen: When Calipari was the coach at Kentucky for 15 years, he routinely produced first-round picks. That streak ended last summer, as Arkansas/Calipari didn't have a player selected in the first round. If the early returns are any indication, it's that the drought won't last long. Acuff and Thomas are both playing at an elite level. Both should be drafted high this summer. Acuff and Thomas are both in the top 10 of CBS Sports' latest freshmen rankings.\nDuke has a gauntlet upcoming: Duke's matchup against Arkansas will mark the second team Scheyer's program has faced this season. The upcoming stretch of games will be more of where that came from. The Blue Devils face reigning national champion Florida next week at home in the ACC/SEC Men's Challenge and also have nonconference games against Michigan State and Texas Tech before ACC play begins.Duke vs. Arkansas prediction, picks\nThis game is going to come down to the play of the freshman on both sides. Can Arkansas slow Boozer down? That's the biggest key in this game. Boozer has looked like a force during the first few weeks of the season. He is a walking double-double capable of taking over a game. Look for Boozer to have a big performance and Duke to cover the spread. Pick: Duke -10\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            DUKE -10.5\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arkansas\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arkansas\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arkansas\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arkansas\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arkansas\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    STRAIGHT-UP\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arkansas\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    Who will win and cover in every college basketball game? Visit SportsLine to get picks from the model that simulates each game 10,000 times and is up more than $1,200 for $100 players on its top-rated spread picks the past six years. \n            ",

The Dallas Cowboys play host to the Kansas City Chiefs on CBS in what has to be one of the most anticipated regular-season games in a long, long time, and we're not talking about just on Thanksgiving.This is a battle of America's teams, or perhaps America's most hated teams. Whether you love them or hate them, it's going to be hard to turn away on Thanksgiving. NFL past dynasty vs. present dynasty will clash in a critical game with a lot at stake and absolutely no shortage of star power. Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce, Chris Jones, Andy Reid, Jerry Jones, Dak Prescott, CeeDee Lamb and more.\nBoth teams are fighting for their playoff lives coming off historic comebacks. It's also a homecoming for Texas native Mahomes. Taylor Swift's fiancé will be playing. Post Malone will be performing at halftime. This game has something for everyone and I cannot wait.Bet Chiefs vs. Cowboys at Bet365 Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets using the bonus code CBSBET365:\nHere's everything you need to know to catch Chiefs-Cowboys on Turkey Day, including key matchups and our prediction:Where to watch Cowboys vs. Chiefs liveDate: Thursday, Nov. 27 | Time: 4:30 p.m. ETLocation: AT&T Stadium (Arlington, Texas)TV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Chiefs -3.5, O/U 52.5 (via DraftKings Sportsbook)Key storylinesCritical game in playoff hunt with both teams on outside looking in: No game has more at stake this week than the Cowboys and Chiefs. The Chiefs are 6-5 coming off the largest fourth-quarter comeback win of Mahomes' career (down 11 vs. Colts) and the Cowboys are 5-5-1 after matching the largest comeback win in team history (down 21 vs. 8-2 Eagles). Both are on the outside of the playoffs looking in right now as the No. 10 seeds in their respective conferences. There's work to do. The winner will enhance their playoff chances while a loss wouldn't quite burst anyone's playoff bubble, but would do a lot of damage, especially in Dallas' case. Kansas City has more at stake than any team in the league right now. The Chiefs have historic streaks in jeopardy, going for an 11th straight playoff appearance, eighth straight AFC title game and fourth straight Super Bowl this year.Chiefs taking over as America's team: This game is going to bring families together. They might be united in their hatred toward two of the NFL's most polarizing franchises, but at least they'll be in it together. You could call this a clash of the NFL's  \"evil empires,\" two accomplished franchises with giant targets on their backs. A matchup of two of the NFL's last three dynasties (sandwiching the 2001-19 Patriots in the middle). The Cowboys won three Super Bowls in the 90s (1992, 1993, 1995) and the Chiefs have won three since drafting Mahomes (2019, 2022, 2023). It's been well documented the Dallas Cowboys are \"America's Team\" but that torch has probably been passed to the Chiefs. Kansas City has made seven straight AFC title games, but Dallas hasn't made an NFC Championship since 1995, the longest active drought in the conference. Mahomes has more Super Bowl MVPs (three) than Prescott has playoff wins (two). A game with more cinema than anyone could imagine will fittingly be played at the NFL's greatest theater, Jerry World. Mahomes homecoming: It will also be a homecoming for Mahomes. He grew up a diehard Cowboys fan just 1.5 hours from Dallas in Tyler, Texas. Remarkably, this is Mahomes' first NFL start at AT&T Stadium. Be ready for a show though as he put up video game numbers in three games at Jerry World when he was at Texas Tech (all neutral site games vs. Baylor). Mahomes averaged over 500 passing yards and five touchdowns in three games at Jerry World, including a 586-yard, six-touchdown performance in the last game of his college career in 2016. Those are crazy numbers, even if it was on a team known for playing a lot of track meets.George Pickens can continue to feast: If Mahomes doesn't provide the fireworks, look to George Pickens, one of the best offseason additions in the entire NFL. He has the second-most receiving yards (1,054) in the NFL this season and the most ever in a player's first 11 games in a Cowboys uniform. He's quickly reaching star status, especially after the damage he did in the Cowboy's Week 12 comeback vs. the Eagles, racking up 133 yards after Dallas trailed 21-0. He's making a Terrell Owens or Randy Moss type impact and he's seemingly good for one 'You Got Moss'd' moment every game. I'm not saying he's going to have an impact like Moss infamously did at Dallas on Thanksgiving in 1998 (three catches, 163 yards, three touchdowns) but I wouldn't be surprised if he caught a deep ball or two. It won't be easy for Kansas City to take him away, either, with All-Pro Lamb on the other side.Cowboys defense can continue turnaround with Quinnen Williams: It would have been easy to write off the Cowboys' season a few weeks ago because of a slow start and horrible defense but Jerry Jones' bold move to trade a first- and second-round pick at the deadline for Quinnen Williams has immediately paid off. The long-term ramifications could be a different story but for now Dallas has won two straight games since Williams made his season debut and the defense has been a big reason why. The Cowboys dominated the trenches vs. the Raiders and Eagles, ranking among the league leaders in pressures (38, third) and rushing yards allowed (45.0 per game, second) in the last two weeks. Rookie first-round pick Ashton Jeanty couldn't get anything going vs. Dallas rejuvenated the line (six carries, 7 yards) and the same could be said of Saquon Barkley (10 carries, 22 yards). The Chiefs might not have a dynamic back, but Kareem Hunt has been lethal in short yardage situations and Mahomes is always a nightmare outside the pocket so Williams could have a huge impact again.You can bet Chiefs vs. Cowboys at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:Travis Kelce's first Thanksgiving game in the NFLFor all the star power on the field, one player might have the most off it. Kelce (and most of the Chiefs) will be playing in their first NFL game on Thanksgiving. Kelce may be slowing down at age 36, but he's still finding a way to be productive. He leads the Chiefs with 674 yards receiving this season and is on pace to become the oldest tight end in NFL history with 1,000 yards receiving in a season. He's never one to shy away from a big stage so expect him to be in the middle of all the action on Thursday. \nPost Malone performs the halftime showThis is a game for everyone. From casual to hardcore NFL fans, Swifties and entertainment enthusiasts. Lifelong Cowboys fan Post Malone will have you covered with the latter as he takes the stage at Jerry World during halftime. Malone has performed at NFL events and games before, including last Christmas when he joined Beyoncé for her halftime show in Houston.\"I'm from Texas. I grew up a Cowboys fan and have been watching this halftime show for years,\" Post Malone said. \"It's a real honor to be part of the Red Kettle Kickoff with The Salvation Army and the Dallas Cowboys and help bring hope to so many people.\"Post Malone has 18 Grammy nominations, 11 Billboard Music Awards, five American Music Awards and six MTV Video Music Awards. The \"Sunflower\" singer has explored many genres in his career, from rap to country to rock.\nPost Malone joins some elite company as Cowboys Thanksgiving Day performers, dating back to Reba McEntire taking the stage in 1997. Randy Travis, Destiny's Child, Sheryl Crow, Carrie Underwood, Kelly Clarkson, Enrique Inglesias, Selena Gomez and the Jonas Brothers are some other performers in the exclusive group.Prediction\nIt's been an up-and-down season for both teams which is why they are hovering right around .500. It's hard to know which version of each team is going to show up on Thursday, but I'm giving Dallas a slight edge. They play better at home (3-1-1 this season vs. 2-4 on road) while the Chiefs have struggled on the road (1-4). This will be a great test to see if the Cowboys' turnaround on defense is legitimate and they could have a leg up in the trenches with Chiefs Pro Bowl guard Trey Smith expected to miss time with an ankle injury. The Cowboys could suddenly be looking more complete on both sides of the ball so I'm taking them to pull off the upset at home in a close game. Pick: Cowboys 27, Chiefs 24 | Cowboys +3.5, Under 52.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        It's Thanksgiving week, so grab some turkey, get a tub of cranberry sauce and let's get ready to make some picks. Actually, I don't even like turkey and cranberry sauce is the worst, so I take back everything I just said. When it comes to Thanksgiving, I only eat three things: Pumpkin pie, apple pie and grapes, but the grapes have preferably been fermented and turned into wine by the time they get to me. I'm not sure how many glasses of wine I'll be having on Thursday, but I do know how many football games I'll be watching: THREE. Normally, that number is closer to two, because I usually nap during at least one game, but there will be no napping this year because the schedule is too loaded. As we head into Thanksgiving, almost every fan base has something to be thankful for and that's the fact that 31 of the 32 NFL teams are still mathematically alive for the playoffs. Even the 1-10 Titans could still get in. On the other hand, if you're celebrating Thanksgiving with a Giants fan, please give them a hug, because their team is the only one that's been eliminated from playoff contention so far. I don't want to make Giants fans sadder than they already are, so let's just get to the picks. \n\n        \n            \n                Prisco's Week 13 NFL picks: Jordan Love leads Packers over Lions, Chiefs top Cowboys in high-scoring game\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nActually, before we get to the Week 13 picks, here's a quick reminder that you can check out the weekly picks from every CBSSports.com NFL expert by clicking here.

Based on my math, that gives you two hours to eat, then you can take another 30 minutes for dessert, and then take a one hour nap so that you'll be ready to roll by the time this game kicks off at 1 p.m. ET. And if you need something to be thankful for, we can all thank Roger Goodell for moving the kickoff time of the first game from 12:30 p.m. ET to 1 p.m. ET this year. It's a small change, but that's 30 extra minutes of eating pumpkin pie. \nTo me, this game feels like the unofficial NFC North title game. Yes, I know the Bears are actually in first place, but their schedule is a ticking time bomb. Over their final six games, they play five teams that currently have seven wins or more. Their only \"easy\" game is against the Browns, a team that might sack Caleb Williams 19 times. The Bears might make the playoffs as a wild card team, but I don't think they're going to win the division, which leaves us with the winner of this game. The Lions are favored to win, but I think that's only because the oddsmakers were taking shots of potato vodka before setting the point spread. Potato vodka is the perfect Thanksgiving drink, but it's not good for setting point spreads. My problem with the Lions is that they are playing a good defense and they have not shown me that they can consistently beat teams that have a good defense. There are nine teams in the NFL that have given up less than 21 points per game this year. The Lions have faced three of those teams and they've gone 0-3 in those games. Let's take a look at what happened in those three games: \nWeek 1: Packers 27-13 over LionsWeek 6: Chiefs 30-17 over LionsWeek 11: Eagles 16-9 over Lions Not only are they 0-3, but they've been outscored 73-39 and they're averaging just 13 points per game. In all three of these games, the Lions were held under 100 yards rushing and when they can't run the ball, that puts all the pressure on Jared Goff. Goff is a good quarterback, but he seems to struggle at times when he's forced to carry the team. Goff got sacked a total of seven times in these three games, including four times in Detroit's season-opening loss to Green Bay. In that Week 1 game, Micah Parsons had practiced roughly three times and he didn't know the Packers' defense yet, but Green Bay still managed to shut down the Lions. The good news for the Lions is that even if they don't score a lot of points, they can still win because Green Bay's offense has forgotten how to move the ball through the air. The Packers' haven't looked the same since losing Tucker Kraft to a season-ending injury in Week 9. In three games without Kraft, Jordan Love is averaging just 163 passing yards per game. \nIf this turns into a defensive battle, I think the Packers win. If this turns into a shootout, I think the Lions win. In their past nine Thanksgiving games, the Lions haven't topped 25 points a single time, so I'm going to go ahead and say a shootout doesn't happen. Turkey won't be the only thing swallowed on Thursday, Goff is going to get swallowed up by the Packers defense. PICK: Packers 20-17 over Lions | Packers +2.5 |  Odds via DraftKings Sportsbook\nKansas City (6-5) at Dallas (5-5-1)Thursday, 4:30 p.m. ET (CBS, Paramount+)\nLast year, we got Tommy DeVito vs. Cooper Rush in the Cowboys' game on Thanksgiving, and the NFL clearly felt bad about that, because this year, we're getting possibly the best Thanksgiving game of all-time with Dak Prescott and the Cowboys facing Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs. I still have nightmares about the DeVito-Rush game, but I think this matchup will help me finally get over that. This game is giving us two teams that both saved their season on Sunday: The Chiefs came back from an 11-point deficit in the fourth quarter to beat the Colts in overtime and then Dallas one-upped them by pulling off an even wilder comeback. The Cowboys beat the Eagles 24-21 in a game where they were trailing 21-0 at one point. The Chiefs' win was the biggest fourth quarter comeback of Mahomes' career while the Cowboys' win was the largest comeback in any game in franchise history, and now, we're getting these two teams in a playoff game. OK, this isn't technically a playoff game, but it's going to feel like it, because neither team can afford to lose. Normally, if there's a team in a must-win situation and the Chiefs are involved, I'm automatically taking them, but I'm not sure if I can do that this week. For one, this game is in Dallas. The Chiefs have been horrible on the road this year, going 1-4 and their only win came against the Giants, so I'm not even sure it counts (Sorry, Giants fans. Didn't mean to drag you into this. Between this and the whole playoff elimination thing, you're just catching strays from me today). \nThe Chiefs are 0-2 on the road this year in the month of November and a big reason they haven't won away from Kansas City is because Patrick Mahomes hasn't looked like Patrick Mahomes. In the two losses, Mahomes has completed just 55.7% of his passes with two interceptions and just one TD pass. For a good chunk of the season, Mahomes has been playing like he doesn't fully trust his receivers or maybe he doesn't trust his offensive line or maybe it's both. I can't quite tell which one, but it's definitely having an impact on what the Chiefs are able to do on offense. To make matters worse, the Chiefs won't have Pro Bowl right guard Trey Smith and this is the worst time to be missing your Pro Bowl right guard because the Cowboys defensive line has been extra dominant since adding Quinnen Williams on Nov. 4. Williams is a human wrecking ball. \nWilliams is so dominant, he can get you 40% off of a Pro Football Focus subscription. \nGoing into the trade deadline, the Cowboys had given up the fourth-most rushing yards per game this year (142.7) and the second most points per game (30.7). In the two games since adding Williams, the Cowboys are 2-0 and they've give up just 45 rushing yards and 18.5 points per game. I don't want to call Jerry Jones a genius, but the man is clearly playing 4-D chess while the rest of us are eating at the kids' table on Thanksgiving. Actually, I take that back, Jones hurt the team by trading Micah Parsons, which led to the Cowboys having the worst defense in the NFL through the first eight weeks and then he tried to save face by adding Williams. This is one of the rare instances where the person trying to save face might have actually saved his face. This could end up being the most watched regular season game in NFL history so I can't possibly pick against America's Team when most of America is going to be watching. PICK: Cowboys 31-24 over Chiefs | Cowboys +3 | Odds via BetMGMCincinnati (3-8) at Baltimore (6-5)Thursday, 8:20 p.m. ET (NBC)\nI'm not sure what you're thankful for this year, but I'm guessing everyone at NBC is thankful that Joe Burrow is returning for this game. On paper, there's almost no reason to watch a 3-8 team play a 6-5 team this late in the season, but with the return of Burrow, this automatically becomes must-see TV. And we know Burrow is playing because he announced it on Instagram by sharing a high school photo of himself in a LeBron James Cavaliers jersey. \nDoes it seem a little crazy for the Bengals to bring Burrow back during what appears to be lost season? Yes, but it's not completely crazy, because the Bengals play in the division that no one wants to win. Here's what the AFC North currently looks like along with each team's remaining schedule: 1. Ravens (6-5) -- Bengals, Steelers, at Bengals, Patriots, at Packers, at Steelers2. Steelers (6-5) -- Bills, at Ravens, Dolphins, at Lions, at Browns, Ravens3. Bengals (3-8) -- at Ravens, at Bills, Ravens, Dolphins, Cardinals, Browns4. Browns (3-8) -- 49ers, Titans, at Bears, Bills, Steelers, at BengalsThe Bengals still have to play the Ravens twice and if they pull off a sweep against Baltimore, that essentially puts them right back in the division race. I'm not saying it's going to happen, I'm just saying that throwing Burrow out there this week is a Hail Mary play that could pay off. \nIn Burrow's first game back, he'll get to face a Ravens defense that's surrendering 230.1 passing yards per game this year, which ranks in the bottom 10 in the NFL. Baltimore's defense has certainly looked better over the past three weeks, but it's hard to say if that's actual improvement or if that's just happened because their last three games have come against Tyrod Taylor (Jets), Dillon Gabriel (Browns) and J.J. McCarthy (Vikings). I have no idea what Burrow is going to look like after two months away, but even a rusty Burrow is an upgrade over those three quarterbacks. And let's not forget, Burrow will have Ja'Marr Chase, who was suspended for Cincinnati's game against New England on Sunday. Even with Chase and Burrow, you can't fully trust the Bengals because of their defense. They haven't been able to stop anyone this year, but this week, they get to face a Ravens' offense that has gotten real good at stopping itself. Over the past three weeks, Lamar Jackson hasn't looked like Lamar Jackson. Since Week 10, he hasn't topped 200 passing yards a single time, he has more interceptions (2) than touchdown passes (1) and his completion percentage has been below 60% (57.1%). He also seems hesitant to run: Jackson has averaged just 14.8 rushing yards per game since returning from his hamstring injury in Week 9. The Bengals are going to be desperate and I think they're going to get a spark from Burrow's return, but I'm not sure that spark is going to be quite big enough to pull off the upset here. PICK: Ravens 27-24 over Bengals | Bengals +7 |Odds via Caesars Sportsbook, where new users get 20 100% profit boosts with the code CBS20X:Chicago (8-3) at Philadelphia (8-3)Friday, 3 p.m. ET (Prime)\nThe Black Friday game is back! I have made it an annual tradition to watch this game on my phone from a mall parking lot so that I get the full Black Friday feel and I highly suggest that you guys all do the same. Anyway, we're headed into Week 13 and I still have no idea if the Bears are any good. Yes, they're 8-3, but only one of those eight wins has come against a team that's currently above .500 and that lone win came on Sunday against a Steelers team that didn't have Aaron Rodgers. Also, the Bears have been collectively outscored by their opponents this year, which makes them just the third team in NFL history to win eight of their first 11 games despite having a negative point differential. I'm not saying the Bears are frauds, but I'm not saying they're not. The Bears have played four games this year against teams that are over .500 and they've gone 1-3 in those games, which could pose a problem down the stretch, because five of their final six games are against teams who are all at least THREE games over .500. Oh, and if you make the playoffs, you'll probably be facing a team that's over .500. This game is going to tell us a lot about both teams. The Bears have been pretty good this year, but if there's one thing they've struggled with, it's stopping the run. They've given up an average of 138.1 rushing yards per game, which is the fifth-most in the NFL. The Eagles are 5-0 this season when they top 100 yards and this should be the perfect game for them to once again hit that number. If the Eagles can't get Saquon Barkley going against this defense, they might just want to give up on running the ball for the rest of the season.The Eagles actually looked like they gave up on running the ball (and passing the ball) against the Cowboys. Philly blew a 21-0 lead in Week 12 and that mostly happened because the offense didn't score a single point over the final 40 minutes of the game. They went seven straight possessions without scoring and if that Eagles team shows up, then the Bears are going to win, but I don't think that Eagles team is going to show up. PICK: Eagles 27-17 over Bears | Eagles -7 |  Odds via FanDuel SportsbookHouston (6-5) at Indianapolis (8-3)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET (CBS, Paramount+)\nIf I've learned one thing this month, it's that the Colts' entire season is a house of cards and it could collapse at any time. When the month of November started, the Colts were 7-1 and they looked like a lock to win the AFC South, but over the past three weeks, Daniel Jones has turned into the Daniel Jones that most people thought he would be when he won the starting job. You know how the first three Indiana Jones movies are all good, but then the last two were just OK? That's Daniel Jones right now. He got off to a hot start, but now, he's just OK. He's thrown four interceptions over the past three weeks, and in a loss to the Chiefs, he threw for just 181 yards. With the game on the line in the fourth quarter against Kansas City, Jones went just 2 of 8 for 13 yards. That's not ideal. The Colts have lost two of their past three while the Texans have won three games in a row, which has put Houston right back in the race for the AFC South title. Let's take a look at the top three spots in the standings: 1. Colts (8-3)2. Jaguars (7-4)3. Texans (6-5)(The Titans also exist, but let's not worry about them). The Colts haven't imploded yet, but that will be dangerously close to happening if they lose this game. If the Colts want to win on Sunday, all they have to do is figure out how to move the ball against the best defense in NFL. The Texans have given up the fewest yards per game (264.3), the second-fewest points per game (16.5), the third-fewest passing yards per game (172.1) and the fifth-fewest rushing yards per game (92.2). They also have 33 sacks on the season and they were so good in Week 12 that they made Josh Allen look like a Division II college quarterback. This feels like a game where the Colts will try to get Jonathan Taylor going, but the Texans will be ready for that, which means if Indy is going to win, Daniel Jones is going to have to come up big. Three weeks ago, I trusted him. I was drinking the Daniel Jones Kool-Aid, but it tasted a little funny, so I spit it out, which is almost fitting, because I feel like the Texans are going to chew him up and spit him out on Sunday. PICK: Texans 19-16 over Colts | Texans +4.5 | Odds via BetMGMNFL Week 13 picks: All the rest49ers 20-16  over BrownsJaguars 24-17 over TitansDolphins 30-16 over SaintsFalcons 23-16 over JetsCardinals 20-17 over BuccaneersRams 30-20 over PanthersSeahawks 31-13 over VikingsBills 30-20 over SteelersChargers 27-20 over RaidersBroncos 23-16 over CommandersPatriots 26-23 over GiantsLast WeekBest pick: Last week, I predicted that Shedeur Sanders would lead the Browns to a win over the Raiders in his first career start and guess what happened? Shedeur Sanders led the Browns to a win over the Raiders in his first career starts. Now, did I know that Geno Smith was going to get sacked 10 times? Of course, I did. If you've watched the Raiders offense play at all this season, it was pretty clear that was going to happen. Every time the Raiders have run a play this season, something bad seems to happen. On every play, it looks like everyone is confused about what they're supposed to do, which might explain why Chip Kelly got fired. The good news for the Raiders is that by firing Kelly, they're now one step closer to a future Super Bowl appearance. \nThe bad news for the Raiders is that they're now 2-9, which means for the 21st time over the past 23 years, they won't be finishing above .500. Worst pick: If you need something to be thankful for this week, just be thankful that you're not a Cardinals fan. The Cards have lost five games this year by four points or less, and for some reason, I thought maybe they could win a close game, so I picked them to beat the Jaguars last week, and that blew up in my face. The Cardinals had a chance to win the game in regulation, but apparently, no one explained to the offense how a spike is supposed to work. After a big play got Arizona down to Jacksonville's 11-yard line, the Cards could have spiked the ball to stop the clock, but instead, they did the opposite of what every other team in the NFL would do in this situation: They let the clock run. \nTrevor Lawrence turned the ball over four times, but the Cardinals lost because they don't understand clock management. This is usually where I would say \"I'm never picking them to win another game,\" but I'm picking them again this week. I clearly hate myself. Finally, if you guys have ever wondered which teams I'm actually good at picking, I'm going to start sharing that information with you now that we've got 12 full weeks of information. Here's a quick look at my best teams when it comes to picks this year. Teams I'm 10-1 picking this year (Straight up): Titans, RaidersTeams I'm 9-2 picking this year (Straight up): Seahawks, Rams, Saints, Broncos, ColtsLongest winning streak: Raiders (10 straight games picked correctly)Teams I'm the worst at picking: Chiefs (4-7)Longest losing streak: Jaguars (Three straight games picked incorrectly)Picks RecordStraight up in Week 12: 10-4SU overall: 114-63-1Against the spread in Week 12: 12-2ATS overall: 87-91You can find John Breech on Facebook or Twitter, and if he's not doing one of those things, he's probably hiding an entire pumpkin pie in his fridge so he doesn't have to share it with his kids. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        We've made it to the most wonderful time of the year: when the family gathers around, there's great food on the table, and some real intense discussions about football! The Thanksgiving and Black Friday slate is chock full of intense rivalries, fascinating matchups and real playoff implications for every team involved. The best part? We get to talk about it before and after the game! So, to get you ready for your Turkey Day festivities, we're going to establish some fun and tell you what you need to know for every Thanksgiving and Black Friday game.Green Bay Packers at Detroit LionsThursday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox  (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)What to talk to your aunts and uncles about: Jared Goff and the Lions' OL against Micah Parsons, Part II.The last time the Detroit Lions faced off against Micah Parsons and the Packers' defense, it was a week 1 bloodbath. The Packers not only held the Lions to their 4th-lowest offensive output of the season by EPA per play, they held the Lions' run game to their worst game of the season when it comes to rushing yards, EPA per carry, Adjusted Yards before Contact and more. The crazy thing about that game? Green Bay isn't the biggest defense in the NFL by sheer size. Their biggest defensive linemen are Nazir Stackhouse and Warren Brinson at 327 and 315 pounds, respectively, and both are rotational defensive tackles. Green Bay steals a lot of gaps in the run game using slants and stunts to create chaos on the ground and allow for their linebackers to flow fast to the ball. However, when teams decide to get big against the Packers' defense and run gap/man concepts, Green Bay shows some cracks. They're only about league average in Yards Before Contact, total rushing EPA and success rate against those concepts this season, and a large part of it is because the slants and stunts they do don't work as well against those concepts. Teams are able to mash them into the ground with lead runs, like Minnesota did using fullback CJ Ham. \nDetroit's offensive line has to be healthy going into this game, because I think for them to win they lean on the Packers' smaller defensive front in the run game. Even without starting left guard Christian Mahogany, NFL Pro has the Lions at a sterling 3.5 yards before contact running between the tackles. RBs Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery didn't have a great day at the office in Week 1, but with Dan Campbell calling plays they could lean more on the ground game. Without Sam LaPorta they've done less 12 personnel, but in substitution they bring backup tackle Dan Skipper on the field and run jumbo personnel. Skipper could be the unsung hero to save their run game against the Packers.Then there's the Jared Goff of it all. Goff has taken on a lot more responsibility when it comes to managing pressure and calling out protections since Week 1, but when the Lions drop back to pass the game will be won over the middle of the field. Jared Goff is the king of the 12-yard dig. He leads the NFL in percentages of attempts over the middle of the field, and in the last matchup with the Packers, he put up a 0.27 EPA per attempt over the middle of the field. \n        \n            \n                Lions vs. Packers prediction: Can Detroit defend home turf or will Green Bay pull off the Thanksgiving upset?\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHowever, where the Packers have been the Dagger killers this season because of how many ways they can get to Tampa 2 in obvious passing scenarios. There are a lot of versatile players on the Packers' defense who can close off those dagger windows, like S Evan Williams and LBs Quay Walker and Edgerrin Cooper. Walker had a great game in their first matchup, and if he's healthy he gives Green Bay some size and range against the speed of Detroit's offense.\nWith all that going on, you also have to deal with Micah Parsons, who speeds up the clock of any passing offense, but especially when he's used as a spinner. Detroit's weakness is between the tackles as a passing unit, and if you get Parsons isolated on Tate Ratledge, Kayode Awosika or whoever ends up at center, I like that matchup for Green Bay.What to talk to your cousins about: Jordan Love finding answers against man coverage and against the blitzWhile the Packers offense has had their ups and downs this season, I think Jordan Love has been fairly steady. An area of growth I've enjoyed seeing from Love is his answers against the blitz this season. According to Sumer Sports, Love is second in the NFL in EPA per play when blitzed and 10th in the NFL in success rate when blitzed, a major jump from 2024 (min. 50 attempts when blitzed). While Love still drifts backwards in the pocket to buy time to attack downfield, he's done a much better job identifying pressures and getting to his answers vs blitzes this season. His command of the offense has grown in what is his third season as the full time starter, and he's gotten his receivers into a lot of really good spots to make plays against the blitz. \nThis play looks like a dangerous throw, but let's examine this for a second. Love adjusts the protection, waving his hand to his right because he catches DB Josh Metellus showing his hand early. The RB ends up whiffing in protection and the Vikings end up getting a free runner against Love. But Love knows where he's hot, and drops one in a bucket to move the chains.\nLove is also one of the best QBs in the NFL against man coverage, but since TE Tucker Kraft tore his ACL, the offense has sputtered when facing man coverage. Green Bay's receiving core is 30th in the NFL in Yards Per Route Run against man since Kraft went out at a paltry 0.79 YPRR, compared to 2nd in the NFL in that same metric at 2.18 YPRR vs man. Also in that same time period since Kraft's injury, Jordan Love has dropped to a 0.16 EPA per play and a 37.0% success rate vs man coverage, compared to a 0.41 EPA per play and 59.6% success rate (per TruMedia). The Packers have struggled to find a consistent receiver to create separation against man coverage since Kraft got hurt, and against a Lions team that plays the most man coverage in the NFL, someone has to step up. Could it be WR Christian Watson, who didn't play in the first matchup with Detroit but is Love's most trusted target downfield? Or could it be WR Jayden Reed, who has the juice to give the Lions fits in man coverage but also might be playing in his first game since a collarbone injury? I'm curious how it pans out against a Lions secondary that got CB DJ Reed back.\nWhat to talk to the kids about: Christian Watson's first down celebrationTrafalgar Law is not only one of the coolest characters in One Piece, but all of anime. Watson doing his \"Room\" pose as his first down celebration is my new favorite thing in the NFL. More anime celebrations please and thank you.\nKansas City Chiefs at Dallas CowboysThursday, 4:30 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)What to talk to your aunts and uncles about: How the Cowboys will defend the Chiefs' passing offense.Chiefs. Cowboys. JerryWorld. Right when Thanksgiving dinner should be getting served. What's better than this for the content and conversations? You're going to want to talk to your aunts and uncles about how the Cowboys' resurgent defense is going to defend one of the most … confusing? Chaotic? Let's go with interesting, one of the most interesting offenses in the NFL in Kansas City.\nWhere this game is really going to potentially get hairy for the Cowboys is against the pass, because QB Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs absolutely SHRED zone coverage. According to Sumer Sports, Mahomes has only been about league average in EPA/play and success rate against man, but when he gets zone he's first in the NFL in EPA/play and success rate. We talked about Christian Watson doing the Trafalgar Law first down celebration, but Mahomes might really be the Surgeon of Death against zone coverage. The way he can manipulate defenders and space with his pocket movement and accuracy is the best in the NFL, and if he gets zone coverage he can find voids in every area. The Chiefs' receivers are also better against zone coverage than man; they're currently tied with the Indianapolis Colts for second in the NFL in Yards Per Route Run against zone compared to 26th in that same metric vs man coverage. Teams have to respect the speed of WRs Xavier Worthy, Hollywood Brown and Tyquan Thornton, which leaves voids for WR Rashee Rice and TE Travis Kelce to kinda just vibe and find gaps.\nWhy it gets difficult for Kansas City so often against man is partially because they don't have many true separators. Rice is a good player, but against man he's more of a matchup on the inside against overmatched nickels and linebackers. Kelce has lost a step so he's not as consistent against man, and the others struggle to get off of press consistently because they're all 150 pounds. So, HC Andy Reid and the offensive braintrust resort to more gimmicky ways of creating separation through stacks and bunches, but those just haven't popped often this season.\n\n        \n            \n                Chiefs vs. Cowboys prediction: Can Patrick Mahomes keep pace with Dak Prescott and the potent Dallas offense?\n                \n                    Douglas Clawson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIt might pop against the Cowboys, because Dallas … doesn't play a lot of man coverage. According to TruMedia, Dallas plays man coverage at the fourth lowest rate in the NFL at 14.1%. After acquiring DT Quinnen Williams, that number … went down to 6.9%. I'm not against DC Matt Eberflus changing his stripes as a coordinator, but the way he's built this defense is to play zone coverage and let the pass rush really get after the QB. I wouldn't be surprised if the Cowboys stick to their guns and play zone coverage, but don't be surprised if Mahomes goes supernova against their zone coverage.What to talk to your cousins about: The dominant defensive tackle play flipping this gameThe trench battles in this game will be legendary, on both sides of the ball. If we want to start with the Chiefs' offense against the Cowboys' defense, it starts with the newest Cowboy Quinnen Williams. Since coming to Dallas, Williams has 15 pressures in two games – he had 19 total as a member of the Jets. The reason Eberflus wants to play zone coverage is because he finally has his impactful defensive tackle in Williams. His power and quickness on the interior has given a lot of teams problems, and if the Chiefs enter this game without RG Trey Smith, it could be open season. Eberflus loves designing his pressure packages around Williams, getting him single matchups like getting a big man a touch in the low post. \nOn the flip side, DT Chris Jones has played his best football in recent weeks. He's got 10 pressures in two games and has been impactful in the run game as well. Dallas' offensive line is much better as a run blocking unit than a pass protecting one, but Kansas City has actually been pretty good defending the run as of late. LBs Nick Bolton, Drue Tranquill and Leo Chenal play really well off of each other in the run game, and with Jones blowing up plays at will they clean up messes at a really high rate. The flip side of that is they're vulnerable to play-action, giving up a success rate and EPA per play with play action that's in the upper half of the league. They ask a lot of their defensive backs in coverage so their linebackers can play aggressively in the run game, but against a team like Dallas with two legitimate stars at wideout and a QB playing some of the best football in the sport, I wonder how DC Steve Spagnuolo buys enough time for Chris Jones to get home. Rookie RG Tyler Booker is going to be in for a whale of a game.What to talk to the kids about: Dak's cadence at the line\"YEAHHHHHHHHH, HERE WE GOOOOOOOO\" is the best cadence in the NFL, courtesy of Dak Prescott. Use this opportunity to tell the kids about cadences in the NFL, where it's a lot different from down, set, hike.Cincinnati Bengals at Baltimore RavensThursday, 8:20 p.m. ET on NBCWhat to talk to your aunts and uncles about: The return of Joe BurrowCincinnati Bengals QB Joe Burrow is back, baby.The Bengals are 3-8 with the worst defense in NFL history, and Tee Higgins might also miss this game with a concussion, but Burrow being back is good for the Bengals and fun for the NFL. There's going to be a lot of buddyball with he and WR Ja'Marr Chase, who might have 30 targets in this game, but I am curious how Burrow adjusts back to the speed of an NFL game where you're facing a team with a different color helmet than yours, especially one that's got as much speed at the second level as the Ravens. With Burrow on the field, the Bengals are averaging 2.29 points per drive this season and 2.23 points per drive in Burrow's career on the field. Without him this season, Cincy drops to 1.94 points per drive. Let's hope he's fully healthy, because a healthy Burrow is fun.\nWhat to talk to your cousins about: Kyle Hamilton's case for Defensive Player of the YearThis is a huge test for Baltimore, who has turned their defense around since the Alohi Gilman trade that allowed Kyle Hamilton to play more in the box. Since Week 7, the Ravens are first in the NFL in points per drive allowed, second in defensive EPA per play and third in defensive success rate. With Hamilton doing his best impression of Flex Seal for the Ravens, they've been able to get their best defensive backs on the field and limit the amount LBs Teddye Buchanan and Trenton Simpson are compromised in coverage. Hamilton is a low key candidate for Defensive Player of the Year, making an impact wherever he's at. He's got a 2.1% Havoc Rate (plays where the player causes a TFL, sack, PBU or INT) on the season, but since the Gilman trade that's jumped up to 3.1%, which isn't only first on the Ravens, but the highest among any safety in the NFL. His instincts, violence and versatility set the tone for the Ravens, even having plays where he thumps guards for TFLs.\nThere really isn't much precedent for a player like Hamilton, who can play overhang extremely well, play deep safety well and blitz with the best of the bunch at the position. He hits like a linebacker and runs like a safety, cleaning up mistakes anywhere Baltimore has him. DC Zach Orr will call blitzes for Hamilton to pick linemen or steamroll running backs! That's not normal for a safety! \n\n        \n            \n                Ravens vs. Bengals prediction: Can Joe Burrow save Cincinnati on Thanksgiving?\n                \n                    Cody Benjamin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIf there's any question I still have about the veracity of the Ravens' defensive turnaround, getting a game against Joe Burrow and Ja'Marr Chase could be a great indicator. They've been great since the Gilman trade, but have played teams like the Dolphins, Vikings, Browns and Jets in that timespan. Let's see if they can keep this up to finish the season.What to talk to the kids about: The Ravens' all-purple uniformsThese, quite frankly, go HARD. It's hard to mess up black, purple and gold, and the Ravens knocked this alternate uniform out the park.\nChicago Bears at Philadelphia EaglesBlack Friday, 3 p.m. ET on Prime VideoWhat to talk to your aunts and uncles about: What's wrong with the Eagles' offense?You thought you wouldn't get Black Friday content in this? THINK AGAIN! The Eagles are 8-3, yes, and have one of the best defenses in the NFL, and yet the offense has been simply pedestrian for the entire season. Here are some of the stats that qualify as the lowest for the Eagles since Jalen Hurts became the full time starter in 2021, per TruMedia:Offensive success rate (43.7%)Offensive EPA/play (0.00)Offensive Points per Drive (2.04)Offensive drive Scoring percentage (34.8%)We got trouble in paradise. The first problem with the offense is the run game, but there are a lot of compounding factors. Let's start with the offensive line, the Eagles' biggest advantage. Due to lingering injuries to LG Landon Dickerson, C Cam Jurgens and RT Lane Johnson, their Adjusted Yards Before Contact per rush is 0.91, which … also is the lowest since Hurts became the starter. However, the second lowest Adjusted Yards before Contact per rush came from 2024 … when Saquon Barkley ran for 2,000 yards. The offensive line hasn't been healthy and they haven't been able to win on the ground as often due to some personnel changes (hello Jack Stoll and Mekhi Becton), but I also think Barkley is feeling the effects of carrying such a heavy workload. Last season, the Eagles' OL did create a lot of holes, but Barkley averaged almost five Yards after Contact per carry, per TruMedia. This season he's gone down to 2.92, a drastic fall off. Now this isn't me saying Barkley is washed or bad, quite the opposite. But I do think Barkley hasn't created many explosive runs, which is hurting the success of the offense.Yet, the biggest problem I think the 2025 Eagles have is their lack of relying on the one answer they have to their offensive problems. When you live in shotgun like the Eagles do (77% shotgun rate in 2025–sixth in the NFL) you find yourself having to use a few more tricks to get defenses out of those two-high structures. Some teams that are exclusively in shotgun use their QB as a run threat, forcing teams to account for the QB as a runner (i.e., Washington). Other teams use RPOs heavily to manufacture quick game and force teams to tackle from depth or put them in a bind (i.e., Kansas City). \n        \n            \n                Eagles vs. Bears prediction: Can Caleb Williams upset the reigning champions on Black Friday?\n                \n                    Cody Benjamin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThis season, the Eagles do neither at the same rate as they used to. This is the lowest designed rush rate for Jalen Hurts in his entire career, and also the lowest RPO rate of his career. Hurts isn't really a quick game passer either, so for the offense to work you have to lean into his ability to run or go gimmicky with RPOs. With opposing defenses getting wiser at defending RPOs, the answer I think the Eagles have to their offensive woes is simple: use Jalen Hurts on designed runs. Not scrambles, but intentional QB draws, QB powers, things that get him moving forward. It won't be a get rich quick scheme offensively, but it should loosen some lanes up for the Eagles' offense.What to talk to your cousins about: Ben Johnson vs. Vic FangioThe most exciting part about this game is the uber-explosive Bears offense going up against the stingy Eagles' defense. Let's use some numbers to set the stage real quick. The Bears' offense is sixth in the NFL in percentage of plays gaining 20 or more yards, fourth in percentage of plays gaining 10 or more yards, ninth in EPA per play and 11th in Success Rate. This offense cashes out in big bills only, with a QB in Caleb Williams who is instructed within the offense to hunt for big plays. Williams is ninth in the NFL in Air Yards per Target per NFL Pro, and eighth in Deep Target rate. This is also with the Bears' receiving corps, while incredibly talented, having a few lapses in focus. Whether it be drops (cough cough DJ Moore) or just not being able to get feet in bounds, their efficiency numbers could be even higher if they just iron out the kinks. The Bears have found an identity in using the run game to set up their explosive play action game, where the Bears are fourth in plays of over 20 yards. Caleb Williams is growing more and more confident in passes over the middle of the field, and while he'll spray some misses in there, these are some SICK rips off play action.\nNow despite the numbers, the Eagles are one of the stingiest defenses in the league when it comes to explosives. Philly's defense has given up plays of over 20 yards on 9.0% of its plays, 12th-highest in the NFL, but with a bevy of pass rushers such as Jalen Carter, Jaelan Phillips and others, the Eagles force teams to bend to their will. Philly keeps a roof on the defense with plenty of Quarters and Cover 6, forcing opposing QBs to throw it short and then rally to make tackles. That's where the defense really starts to kick in. With the pressure rate turning up since the Phillips trade, and the Eagles' ability to bat passes down, they make offense so difficult. The problem here is pretty simple, though: Williams and the Bears don't really check it down. Their checkdown is Williams' scrambles, which keep them explosive as well. To keep it simple: this is a game between an offense that wants to skip over the collard greens and corn at the Thanksgiving table and go straight for the sweet potato pie, against a defense that makes you eat vegetables first. If Williams can pose headaches for the Bears through his sack avoidance and scrambling, then connect on a few explosives, I think the Bears have a great shot at winning.What to talk to the kids about: The Bears' receivers first down celebrationThe Bears, as a whole, have a dope first down celebration, and it's taking over TikTok. I'll even find myself doing first down celebrations after completing stories and podcasts. Come up with some first down celebrations with the kids and they'll be alright.\n            ",

The model simulates games over 10,000 times, and identifies top plays based on those scenarios. That has led the model to an impressive 49-33 record on top-rated picks since last season, and we're now putting this Thanksgiving matchup between the Chiefs and Cowboys in its crosshairs. We can tell you it has one side of the moneyline hitting in 62% of simulations. To see who that is, head on over to SportsLine.  Chiefs -3: \"This is essentially a playoff game. Neither team can afford a loss with where they are right now. Dallas upset the Eagles at home last week, while the Chiefs beat the Colts. Patrick Mahomes played well in that game and seemed to come alive in the fourth quarter. He will continue that here. Dak Prescott won't keep up. Chiefs take it.\" -- CBS Sports Senior NFL analyst Pete Prisco on why he has Kansas City taking down the Cowboys, 30-24. To see the rest of his Week 13 picks, click here.Cowboys +3.5: \"This Cowboys defense is no longer one of the worst units in the NFL. Since they acquired Quinnen Williams and Logan Wilson (and activated some other players from injured reserve), the Cowboys are 2-0 while allowing 18.5 points per game and 45 rushing yards per game. Previously ranked in the bottom five, the Cowboys run defense has been the best in the NFL over the last two weeks. Obviously the Chiefs aren't known for their incredible rushing attack, but I think the Cowboys offense can outscore Patrick Mahomes. Dallas has covered in back-to-back Thanksgiving games while the Chiefs have failed to cover in three straight contests. I say this Cowboys offense is too tough to contain.\" -- CBS Sports NFL writer Jordan Dajani on why he has the Cowboys covering the spread and beating the Chiefs outright on Thanksgiving.

Yes, they've won five straight after beginning the year 1-5 and are now atop the AFC North standings, but they seem a bit disjointed in recent weeks. Specifically, Lamar Jackson hasn't been as prolific as we've grown accustomed to, tallying zero touchdowns and two giveaways over the last two weeks. While Cincinnati's defense is one of the worst units in the NFL this season, they played the Patriots well last week, providing a glimmer of hope that they can be something close to serviceable down the stretch. If they provide some resistance, that'll help Joe Burrow immensely as he makes his return to action for the first time since suffering his turf toe injury. With Ja'Marr Chase back in the fold as well, the Bengals have an offense that can keep this divisional matchup close. In his career, Burrow is 17-3 ATS as an underdog of three or more points.\" -- CBS Sports NFL writer Tyler Sullivan on why he is taking the points with the Bengals in this final leg of Thursday's triple-header. To see the rest of his Week 13 picks, click here. Bengals +7: \"I'm assuming here that Joe Burrow plays, as is expected. The Ravens have looked ... okay since Lamar Jackson's return from injury. The defense has been better since it got healthier and, with Tee Higgins out, should be able to really focus in on Ja'Marr Chase. But the offense hasn't been explosive enough for me to think the Ravens are going to blow these guys out. Until we see Lamar Jackson look fully healthy, I continue to think they'll play close games.\" -- CBS Sports NFL writer Jared Dubin on why he has Cincinnati covering over Baltimore.

In his last 67 picks involving Philadelphia, Silverstein is 40-25-1 (+1260), which makes him an ideal expert to lean on for this \"Black Friday\" contest from Lincoln Financial Field. We can tell you Silverstein is leaning Under the 44.5 point total, but to see his official play for this standalone matchup, you'll need to log on to SportsLine. \nEagles -7: \"This is a big prove-it game in front of the national audience for the Bears. For the Eagles, it's a chance to get back on track after losing to the Cowboys. I think they will. Their defense will force some Caleb Williams turnovers that lead to short fields. And Saquon Barkley will actually get the ball. Eagles win it.\" -- CBS Sports Senior NFL analyst Pete Prisco on why he likes Philly to bounce back with a 30-21 win over the Bears at home.

    "body": "\n        \r\nTuesday in Vegas at the Players Era Festival -- which saw Tennessee down Houston and gave us Gonzaga and Michigan blowout wins over Maryland and Auburn, respectively -- was but an appetizer to the main course set for Wednesday as we wrap the week from Sin City.   \r\n\r\n\r\nThe spread on tap includes Iowa State (unbeaten on the season and 2-0 this week) taking on Syracuse (0-2 on the week) in the early window and concludes late with a 10:30 p.m. ET tip between Baylor and San Diego State. In between, we have the third-place game between Tennessee and Kansas at 7 p.m. ET and the first place game between Gonzaga and Michigan headlining action at 9:30 p.m. ET. The winner of that game earns an additional $1 million prize. There are also financial prizes to be had for runner-up, third-place and fourth-place finishers.   \r\n\r\n\r\nSo clearly: There's plenty at stake -- to say nothing of the potential NCAA Tournament implications down the line -- setting us up for what should be a fantastic finish. And so to celebrate the basketball bonanza I've convened our experts to make picks for every game from Vegas both straight up and against the spread.    \r\n\r\n\r\nThose picks are below.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\tOdds via DraftKings Sportsbook | All times ET                                      \r\n\n\r\n   No. 14 St. John's vs. No. 21 Auburn   \r\n\n\r\n\t8 p.m. on truTV: This is my upset pick of the day and underdog I'm willing to ride. I'll admit: It feels like shaky ground to stand on given the way Michigan clobbered the Tigers, 102-72, on Tuesday. But the Tigers as a result of that will presumably be ready for this fight. Pick: Auburn +4.5 -- Boone   \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n   \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\nSJ -4.5\r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            St. John's\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n   \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Auburn\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Auburn\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            St. John's\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            St. John's\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nSTRAIGHT-UP\r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            St. John's\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n   \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Auburn\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            St. John's\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            St. John's\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            St. John's\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n   No. 7 Michigan vs. No. 12 Gonzaga              \r\n\n\r\n\t9:30 p.m. on TNT: I don't know what the number would have to be to pick Michigan ATS in this one but I do know this: It'd have to be (quite a bit) bigger than the current spread of 2.5 points. This Zags team looks like a wagon right now and it is bludgeoning teams with a scoring margin through seven games that is second-highest in college basketball. Coming off a 39-point beatdown of Maryland on Tuesday I'm laying the points with the better team. Pick: Gonzaga -2.5 -- Boone   \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n   \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\nZAGS -2.5\r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n   \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Gonzaga\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Gonzaga\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nSTRAIGHT-UP\r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n   \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Gonzaga\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Gonzaga\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n                Baylor vs. San Diego State                   \r\n\n\r\n\t10:30 p.m. on truTV: Baylor struggled defensively vs. St. John's on Tuesday but still managed 81 points in a shootout as Cam Carr continued his big week with 27 points. I'm expecting SDSU to be a more manageable matchup for this brand-new Bears team as they figure out their pieces, and their ability to score consistently -- even if the defense is a mess right now -- should be enough to get them by in a close one. Pick: Baylor -2.5 -- Boone   \r\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n   \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\nBAY -2.5\r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Baylor\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n   \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Baylor\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            San Diego St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Baylor\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Baylor\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nSTRAIGHT-UP\r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Baylor\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n   \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Baylor\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            San Diego St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Baylor\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Baylor\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n   No. 8 Alabama vs. Maryland   \r\n\n\r\n\t12 a.m. on TNT: Maryland's 39-point beatdown at the hands of Gonzaga on Tuesday surely opened the eyes of the Terps.

That's the perils of an event that has criteria for sorting matchups on scoring differential. The basketball gods will shine upon ISU, though, and I predict this team will be motivated to prove a point that its exclusion from the prize fight -- criteria be damned -- was an oversight. Pick: Iowa State -10.5 -- Boone   \r\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n   \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\nISU -10.5\r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n   \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Syracuse\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Syracuse\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nSTRAIGHT-UP\r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n   \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n                No. 3 Houston vs. Notre Dame                   \r\n\n\r\n\t3:30 p.m. on TNT: The Houston we've seen in Vegas this week is not the Houston I predict we will see in March when it is firing on all cylinders.

This could be a spot for the Irish to keep it within the number, though I doubt the final outcome is ever in real doubt. Pick: Notre Dame +11.5 -- Boone \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n   \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\nHOU -11.5\r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Houston\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n   \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Notre Dame\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Houston\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Notre Dame\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Houston\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nSTRAIGHT-UP\r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Houston\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n   \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Houston\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Houston\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Houston\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Houston\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n   No. 17 Tennessee vs. Kansas          \r\n\n\r\n\t7 p.m. on TNT: Tennessee is coming off of arguably the best win of the week --  a 76-73 victory over Houston -- but this is a potential letdown spot against a Kansas team that has quietly looked good even without Darryn Peterson this week. The Jayhawks are playing well defensively and smashing teams on the boards. Whether they can keep that up against Tennessee -- which wins in similar fashion -- is TBD. But I'm not writing off KU as a potential upset in this one. Pick: Kansas +5.5 -- Boone \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n   \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\nTENN -5.5\r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kansas\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n   \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kansas\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Tennessee\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Tennessee\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kansas\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nSTRAIGHT-UP\r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Tennessee\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n   \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Tennessee\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Tennessee\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Tennessee\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kansas\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\n            ",

For detailed rationale, check out my latest content, including my weekly Lineup Decisions column.                      What do the numbers mean?\nAll of my analyses from the week, from data points to matchup outlooks to game-flow predictions, are basically represented by a number on a confidence scale from 1-10. The higher the number next to a player's name, the more confident I am that you should start him. The numbers are not a projection, just a confidence score to help you pick who to start. Every relevant player for this week is here, so if a player isn't listed, don't start him.                      To find a specific player, use your search function -- CTRL-F on PCs and Command-F on Macs. If neither of those are options, or if you're on a mobile device, you can scroll by game. If you're still unsure, just send a note on X.com (@daverichard) and I'll give it a look, time permitting. Remember to use the #AskFFT hashtag!                      If you're reading this on Sunday, please refer to our weekly rankings, which are updated in real time.                  Ready to get off on the right foot?

Branch's actions drew the ire of Chiefs wideout JuJu Smith-Schuster, who was smacked in the face by Branch when he confronted the Lions' defensive back. That started a fight between the two teams. \n\"I love Brian Branch, but what he did is inexcusable, and it's not gonna be accepted here,\" Lions coach Dan Campbell said from the podium after the game.\"It's not what we do. It's not what we're about. I apologize to coach [Andy] Reid and the Chiefs.\"Reid said that there had been \"pretty good damage\" to Smith-Schuster's nose, but no further details were provided. \"You guys saw it. The guy came up and hit Juju for what looked like no reason.\"\nMahomes didn't hold back when asked about what happened immediately after the game. \"We play the game in between the whistles,\" Mahomes told NBC Sports. \"They can do all the extra curricular stuff in between the whistles. I thought we played a great game today. And we'll keep this momentum moving forward.\" Rest assured, there will be repercussion for Sunday night's fight, especially for Branch, who according to NBC Sports' broadcast has already been fined three times this year after receiving seven league-issued fines in 2024. Regarding the game, the Chiefs definitely brought the fight to the 4-2 Lions, who saw their four-game winning streak come to an end in Kansas City. \nSunday night was an especially big night for Mahomes, who became the fastest quarterback in NFL history to reach 300 career touchdown passes including the postseason. Mahomes threw three touchdown passes as the Chiefs improved to 3-3 on the season. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        At the end of a charge from third to first in the closing laps, Denny Hamlin drove away to a milestone victory that may serve as one of the most important of his entire career, winning the South Point 400 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway to earn his sixth win of the 2025 season and the 60th win of his Cup Series career. Hamlin's 60th win ties him with Kevin Harvick for 10th on NASCAR's all-time wins list, and it also secures him a spot in the Championship 4, ensuring him the opportunity to race for the Cup title that has long eluded him in the season finale at Phoenix Raceway.Sunday's race, and the complexion of the championship picture, swung dramatically in a sequence of events that began with 32 laps to go. Only a few laps after losing the lead to Kyle Larson on a bobble in turns 1 and 2, William Byron was running second and trying to run Larson back down for the lead, only to be caught completely unaware of the lapped car of Ty Dillon peeling off to come to pit road in front of him. Byron ended up slamming into the back of DIllon's car at nearly full speed, taking him out in a grinding crash and bringing out the caution.\n        \n            \n                NASCAR playoffs 2025 race schedule, results: Complete list of Cup Series race dates, winners, tracks\n                \n                    Steven Taranto                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTwo playoff drivers, Chase Briscoe and Joey Logano, elected to gamble on the ensuing round of pit stops by taking two tires, and a multi-car crash on the restart helped their gambit by creating just a 14-lap run to the finish. But the four tires that Hamlin took would eventually win out: After taking second at the end of several laps battling with Kyle Larson, Hamlin quickly drove down Briscoe and powered around his outside with four laps to go, driving away to earn a win with many different layers to it.Normally a driver who relishes the role of heel and instigator, Hamlin was noticeably emotional over his team radio and then on the frontstretch after the checkered flag. Emotion which came out, in part, given that his father Dennis has been ill.\n\"This is the point where I kind of give the fans some shit, but not today. I appreciate all of you so much,\" Hamlin told the crowd before speaking to USA. \"... [Crew chief Chris Gabehart] did an amazing job on that final stop getting the car just right, and I just held it down. That's all I could do is just go for it. I felt like I had nothing to lose. Just go for it and try to punch the ticket now. And, man, this one feels great.\"Larson and Christopher Bell made it past Briscoe in the final laps to finish second and third, with Briscoe coming home fourth and Tyler Reddick finishing fifth. Logano would parlay his strategy into a sixth place finish, with Alex Bowman seventh, Kyle Busch eighth, Ryan Preece ninth and Brad Keselowski rounding out the top 10.\nThe race, of course, could have been far different: William Byron led three times for 55 laps and looked destined to be a central character in the race for the win, but he was instead left to lament his accident with Ty Dillon, in which Byron said he received no indication that the No. 10 Chevrolet in front of him was coming to pit road.\n\"I never saw him wave. I didn't see any indication that he was pitting, and it was probably 12 to 15 laps after we had pitted, so I thought the cycle [of green flag stops] was fully over,\" Byron told USA. \"Nobody said anything to my spotter from what I know. I had zero idea. ... I was watching him thinking 'okay, he missed the bottom a little bit here' and then he just started slowing, and I had no idea what was going on.\"I'm just devastated. I had no indication, so I obviously wouldn't have just driven full speed into the back of him like that.\"Byron was left with a 36th place finish, just two spots ahead of fellow playoff driver Ryan Blaney, who saw his race end after just 70 laps when he blew a tire and pounded the wall in turns 3 and 4. Chase Elliott also had major problems after his pit crew was penalized for an uncontrolled tire violation, but he was able to eventually get back on the lead lap and salvage an 18th place finish.\nAs Hamlin now automatically advances to the Championship 4, Kyle Larson (+45), Christopher Bell (+20) and Chase Briscoe (+15) now leave Las Vegas on the plus side of the cut line to join him there. Byron (-15), Elliott (-23), Logano (-24) and Blaney (-31) now trail the cut line, but do so entering next weekend's middle race of the Round of 8 at Talladega Superspeedway -- a place where much can change and change quickly.\nSouth Point 400 results#11 - Denny Hamlin#5 - Kyle Larson#20 - Christopher Bell#19 - Chase Briscoe#45 - Tyler Reddick#22 - Joey Logano#48 - Alex Bowman#8 - Kyle Busch#60 - Ryan Preece#6 - Brad Keselowski#2 - Austin Cindric#17 - Chris Buescher#4 - Noah Gragson#47 - Ricky Stenhouse Jr.#43 - Erik Jones#71 - Michael McDowell#35 - Riley Herbst (R)#9 - Chase Elliott#16 - A.J.

The Mariners haven't been to this round since 2001 and have never won the AL pennant. They remain the only team of 30 in MLB to have never played in the World Series. They'll have their chance to advance here, but they have to deal with a hungry Blue Jays team.

The Mariners, looking for their first World Series berth, are salivating at the idea of a 2-0 lead by the end of Monday.Blue Jays: Toronto may not have a clear frontline starter in the rotation, but Game 2 starter Trey Yesavage has looked like it in his short major-league career. Last time out, he struck out 11 Yankees in 5 ⅓ no-hit innings of ALDS Game 2. Now the Blue Jays look to him to shut down the Mariners too.\n Game 2 prediction After dropping Game 1, the Blue Jays will ride rookie Trey Yesavage's golden righty arm to a Game 2 win to even the ALCS at a game apiece. An offense that was held to two hits in Game 1 will come back to life, and put Game 2 out of reach in the middle innings. Blue Jays win by at least four runs. -- Mike Axisa\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

Mahomes reached the milestone in just 139 games, breaking the mark that was previously held by current Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who threw his 300th touchdown pass in his 147th game. \nPrior to Rodgers, Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino had the record for the fewest games needed to reach 300 touchdown passes. Marino, who threw his 300th touchdown pass in his 152nd game, finished his regular season career with 420 touchdown passes, which was the most in NFL history at the time of his retirement after the 1999 season. Fellow Hall of Famer Peyton Manning came somewhat close to matching Marino's record, as he needed 161 games to reach 300 career touchdown passes. Manning's 539 career touchdown passes during the regular season is the third-highest total in league history, behind only Tom Brady's 649 and Drew Brees' 571. \nSpeaking of Hall of Fame quarterbacks, Mahomes' touchdown pass to Worthy was his 254th regular season touchdown pass, which put him into a tie with Hall of Famer Dan Fouts and former Bengals Pro Bowl quarterback Andy Dalton for 25th on the all-time list. \n            \n    ",

The injury will necessitate surgery and end Warner's season.Warner's injury occurred when he and teammate, safety Ji'Ayir Brown, converged while defending a running play. As Brown swung round while tackling Buccaneers running back Rachaad White, Brown rolled into Warner's right leg, pinning his foot under and twisting it at a bad angle. Warner remained down after the play before a cart took him off the field with his right leg in an air cast.\nSpeaking to reporters after the 49ers' 30-19 loss, 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan confirmed that Warner had broken and dislocated his ankle. As a result of the injury and subsequent surgery, Warner will miss the remainder of the 2025 season.Warner's loss marks yet another devastating blow to the 49ers, who have already lost a number of star players including two of their best on defense. Warner's injury comes three weeks after defensive end Nick Bosa, another pillar of San Francisco's defense, was lost for the season with a torn ACL suffered in Week 3. The 49ers are also dealing with injuries to quarterback Brock Purdy, tight end George Kittle and wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk among others.\n\n        \n            \n                Jauan Jennings injury: 49ers WR played through five broken ribs, ankle sprains in Week 6 loss to Buccaneers\n                \n                    Carter Bahns                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWarner has been one of the best inside linebackers in all of pro football since entering the league in 2018.

    "body": "\n        Penn State ultimately gave James Franklin everything he had been asking for.  In just one offseason: The school bankrolled the hiring the nation's highest-paid assistant coach, $3 million defensive coordinator Jim Knowles. PSU's supporters stepped up in big ways in the NIL department to keep talented players like quarterback Drew Allar, running back Nicholas Singleton and defensive end Dani Dennis-Sutton for one more year rather than go on to the NFL. In the spring the Nittany Lions added Syracuse receiver Trebor Pena, one of the pricier receiver options in the portal, to ameliorate what's been a disappointing receivers corp for years.It was all set up for this to be Penn State's \"Last Dance\" title run. Michigan and Ohio State provided the blueprint the last two seasons, and the Nittany Lions had all the resources, on paper, to make the same run. A year after making it to a national semifinal, this was a title-or-bust kind of year.  \n        \n            \n                The failure to develop QB Drew Allar sealed James Franklin's fate at Penn State\n                \n                    Brian Dohn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAnd yet on Oct. 12, midway through the season, not only is Penn State out of the title race but Franklin is out of a job. It's a stunning development, the most surprising firing in decades potentially given the timing, and also perhaps a sign of things to come across the industry. What Franklin and Penn State taught us is there's a price to going all-in on a season: When you finally have everything you've asked for, with no excuses left, and you still don't perform as expected, then you are the problem.  For years, Franklin complained behind-the-scenes about not having the same resources as Big Ten peers Ohio State and Michigan. In 12 seasons at Penn State, Franklin had considerable success including five top-10 finishes and five New Year's Day Six bowls. But he could always point to not having as much as the truly elite programs as the reason why his program couldn't get over the hump in its ghastly 4-21 record against top-10 opponents. He could argue his results matched the investment.  \nTo Franklin's point, Penn State was behind in a few key areas. Certainly, Penn State wasn't as aggressive -- or have as much of a cash arsenal -- in the NIL department as some of its old Big Ten East rivals. Franklin frequently brought up to Penn State boosters all the resources Ohio State had, which included one of the nation's most expensive rosters a season ago.  \n        \n            \n                James Franklin will be a red-hot candidate despite Penn State firing: 'No way he goes to Florida, right?'\n                \n                    Chris Hummer                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe complaining and the recent on-field success pushed Penn State boosters to dig deeper to give Franklin everything he needed to win it all this season. Franklin himself admitted before the season that his roster had never been better in his 12 seasons leading Penn State.  \"This is the best combined personnel that I think we've had at Penn State,\" Franklin said at Big Ten Media Days. \"And when I talk about personnel, I'm talking about players and staff, from a depth, from a talent standpoint, and from an experience standpoint.\" \nWhen you have all that, you can no longer play the resources excuse card. The pressure to succeed cranked up, and especially in losses to UCLA and Northwestern, Franklin wilted under it. He couldn't manage the disappointment of failing in spite of a major resource advantage over the Bruins and Wildcats.  This has already been the busiest pre-November coaching carousel in the FBS era and it will only get crazier with big jobs expected to still open up. And at the biggest programs that could come open, faltering despite bundles of resources will be a defining cause.  It could certainly be that case at Florida and Auburn.  At Auburn especially, Hugh Freeze has been given everything he's wanted from a NIL and program resources standpoint. The Tigers paid heavily to add Georgia Tech transfer receiver Eric Singleton and gave Freeze what he needed to go out and get a marquee transfer QB. He picked Oklahoma transfer Jackson Arnold, a decision that multiple industry sources immediately questioned as curious knowing what was at stake for Freeze this season. That skepticism has only gotten worse amidst Auburn's offensive woes in its 3-3 start to the season.  \nWhen you're an offensive guru, you are giving two million-plus dollar receivers in Singleton and Cam Coleman, a pricey quarterback in Arnold and you still aren't succeeding, you run into a problem.  As one industry source put it before the season, \"If they move on from Hugh, someone will take over one of the most loaded rosters in the country that has just not produced.\" In Gainesville, Napier is facing the similar weight of expectations that come with the huge resources to hire an army of analysts and personnel folks, land a top-flight quarterback in DJ Lagway and be competitive about filling the roster with top talent. Napier flourished in excelling with less at Louisiana, but that success hasn't translated at Florida where almost every ask is granted.  \nEventually, even the most ardent well-heeled boosters expect a return on investment. You can convince them for a year or two, perhaps, that you just don't have the right ingredients to meet expectations. But after you persuade them to spend millions to get you exactly what you want and the results don't change, the desire to switch the chef rather than pour more money into groceries gains steam. \n        \n            \n                Penn State coaching candidates: Matt Rhule, Curt Cignetti among options on hot board to replace James Franklin\n                \n                    Carter Bahns                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nA year ago, Ohio State was as all-in as it gets in a title-or-bust year. It was bumpy along the way and Ohio State coach Ryan Day came close to crumbling under the pressure of it. The Michigan loss nearly broke him. In the end, though, Day was hoisting up a national championship trophy and all the investment paid off.  That's what Penn State wanted -- expected, really -- from Franklin this season. It could handle a double-overtime loss to Oregon at home, as back-breaking as it was. It could not, and would not, accept losses to two Big Ten bottom-dwellers that were both more than 20-point underdogs against the Nittany Lions.  \nWith more resources come higher expectations. Franklin learned that the hard way, but he won't be the last.  In the NIL and revenue share era were coaches are constantly cajoling and begging for more, be careful what you wish for.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    If you want all of the latest Penn State coaching search news and info, there's no better place than Lions247.

    "body": "\n        Another incredible Sunday of football is in the books, and as per usual, there were some incredible performances all around the league. Of course, by the same token, there were also some not-so-incredible performances, just as there are week after week.That's why we're here, to highlight some of the best and worst of what we saw on Sunday. So without further ado, here are some winners and losers for Week 6 of the NFL season.Loser: Justin Fields and the JetsNew York's offense as an epic disaster on Sunday in London, with the \"passing\" game in particular stinking up the joint. Fields dropped back to pass 29 times but only actually attempted 17 passes, because he was sacked NINE times and scrambled a few more. \nIn the end, the Jets actually had negative net passing yards: Fields went 9 of 17 for 45 yards, but he took 55 yards worth of sacks. His passer rating was 58.7 and his QBR was an even more ridiculous 9.0. To say it was ugly would be one of the most significant understatements of the season.\nWinner: Rico DowdleDowdle talked some pregame smack to his former team, telling the Dallas Cowboys that they should buckle up their chin straps to get ready to play against him and the Carolina Panthers. (Dallas allowed Dowdle to walk in free agency this offseason, choosing instead to sign Javonte Williams and Miles Sanders.) Dowdle came out against Dallas and backed up his talk with his play: he went over 200 total yards for the second week in a row, rushing an incredible 30 times for 183 yards and catching four passes for 56 yards and a touchdown.\n\n        \n            \n                Tua Tagovailoa sheds light on Dolphins dysfunction, calls out players-only meeting absences\n                \n                    Carter Bahns                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLoser: Tua TagovailoaTagovailoa had a brutal game against the Chargers, completing 21 of 32 passes for 205 yards, one touchdown and three interceptions. He then come out after the game and called out the rest of his team and questioned the team's leadership. \n\"I think it starts with the leadership and helping articulate that for the guys,\" Tagovailoa said. \"And then what we're expecting out of the guys, right? We're expecting this, are we getting that, are we not getting that? We have guys showing up to player-only meetings late, guys not showing up to player-only meetings. There's a lot that goes into that. Do we have to make that mandatory, do we not have to make this mandatory? So it's a lot of things of that nature that we've gotta get cleaned up, and it starts with the little things like that.\"\nWinner: Jaxon Smith-Njigba's crazy seasonJSN continues to absolutely dominate. In Week 6 against the Jaguars, he went nuts again, catching eight passes for 162 yards and a touchdown. Through six games, he now has 42 receptions for 696 yards and three scores. \nHe's averaging a preposterous 4.49 yards per route run, according to TruMedia, over a full yard more than the next-closest player. There has been 2,293 instances of a playing running at least 50 routes in the first six weeks of the season over the last 10 years. JSN's yards per route run so far this season ranks second-best among that group of players. He's having an outrageous start to the season with no signs of slowing down. Winner: Kimani VidalThe Chargers' second-year running back had a breakout game in L.A.'s first week without either Omarion Hampton or Najee Harris. Vidal went for 124 yards on 18 carries, while also catching three passes for 14 yards and a touchdown. Initially expected to work behind the veteran Hassan Haskins, Vidal was instead the lead back for the Chargers and played a key role in their win over the Dolphins.\nLoser: InjuriesA great many notable players left their games early due to injuries today, including but not limited to Garrett Wilson (knee), Puka Nacua (ankle), Marvin Harrison Jr. (concussion), David Njoku (knee), Calvin Ridley (hamstring), Emeka Egbuka (hamstring), Trey Hendrickson (back) and, most notably, Fred Warner (ankle), who was carted off the field with an air cast on his leg. He suffered a dislocated and broken ankle, and he will undergo season-ending surgery, according to Kyle Shanahan. For a team that's already missing Nick Bosa on defense and seemingly half of its offense, it's just a brutal blow. Winner: Steelers' division hopesPittsburgh improved to 4-1 with a win over the Browns. But that's not all that happened here. All three of the non-Steelers teams in the AFC North lost. That means that not only are they 4-1, but the Bengals are 2-4 and the Browns and Ravens are both 1-5. If Pittsburgh can win on Thursday night against Cincinnati, it might be able to build a nearly insurmountable division lead -- even if the Ravens look dynamite when Lamar Jackson recovers from his injury. \n            ",

There were four quarterbacks around the league who were sacked at least four times on Sunday. \nJustin Fields got beat up by the Broncos defense during a game where he was sacked nine times. It was the most sacks that Denver had recorded in a single game since 1996.Jacksonville's Trevor Lawrence got sacked seven times by the Seahawks defense.Browns rookie Dillon Gabriel had no chance against a Steelers defense that sacked him six times.Titans rookie Cam Ward also had a painful day: He got sacked six times by the Raiders.Mac Jones has got sacked six times in San Francisco's loss to Tampa BayTyler Huntley didn't even start for the Ravens, but he still got sacked four times by the Rams. Those six quarterbacks got sacked a combined 38 times, and not surprisingly, they went 0-6 on Sunday. With that in mind, let's get to the Week 6 grades, starting with Seattle's impressive win in Jacksonville. Kansas City 30-17 over DetroitSeattle 20-12 over JacksonvilleGreen Bay 27-18 over CincinnatiTampa Bay 30-19 over San FranciscoLas Vegas 20-10 over TennesseeIndianapolis 31-27 over ArizonaL.A.

    "body": "\n        The NFL continues to provide the drama, no matter the week. The Sunday afternoon slate in Week 6 didn't disappoint, even if the games weren't exactly the heavyweight title fights we are accustomed to watching. The heavyweight title fight we did get was the Kansas City Chiefs taking down the Detroit Lions, a matchup of two of the powers in the NFL. Kansas City salvaged their season by getting to 3-3 while Detroit fell to 4-2. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers established their place as a championship contender after beating the San Francisco 49ers, while the Green Bay Packers handled the Cincinnati Bengals. The Carolina Panthers did improve to .500 after upsetting the Dallas Cowboys, while the Pittsburgh Steelers have full command of the AFC North after beating the Cleveland Browns -- and the Baltimore Ravens losing (again). The Indianapolis Colts did improve to 5-1 after a thrilling win over the Arizona Cardinals while the Seattle Seahawks went to 4-2 after beating the Jacksonville Jaguars.\nPlenty of storylines developed on Sunday. Which of those storylines are overreactions and which are reality? Or are we overreacting too much to a result? Patrick Mahomes is back to his MVP formOverreaction or reality: RealityAmazing what happens when Mahomes gets a deep threat back in Xavier Worthy. Mahomes threw three touchdown passes in the Chiefs' win over the Lions, having a 132.2 passer rating and averaging 8.6 yards per attempt. All of a sudden Travis Kelce gets open between the hashmarks because there is a deep threat over the top, but the beneficiary is Mahomes. In the three games Mahomes had Worthy back at wide receiver, he has completed 70.4% of his passes for 845 yards with eight touchdowns and one interception and a 114.2 passer rating. On passes of 10+ air yards, Mahomes has completed 51.6% of his passes for 339 yards with two touchdowns and zero interceptions since Worthy's return.\nMahomes just looks like a different quarterback who can read the pressure coming and get the ball to his playmakers with that added help over the top. Even better news? The Chiefs get Rashee Rice back next week. Lions are paper tigers in NFCOverreaction or reality: OverreactionThe Lions have two losses on the season -- the Packers in Week 1 and the Chiefs in Week 6 -- both on the road. For a team with Super Bowl aspirations, the Lions don't have any huge wins on their playoff resume. Does this mean they are paper tigers? Not at all. The Lions are still good, and are severely banged up in the secondary with five of their top six cornerbacks injured. That's a tall task for any team, especially when they are facing the Chiefs. The offense didn't live up to par either, scoring just 17 points against a Chiefs defense that stopped extended drives and held the offense to 0-for-2 on fourth down. \nThe Lions do have four wins, but those are against teams with a combined record of 6-17. They are beating the teams they are supposed to beat, but the two heavyweights on their schedule are losses.While it's early, the Lions need to win a big game to prove they are a Super Bowl contender -- even though they are banged up right now. A win against the Buccaneers next week will help, but Detroit will be healthy for the stretch run in November and December. Mac Jones proved he can start again in the NFLOverreaction or reality: RealityNo matter what Jones did (or didn't do) in Sunday's loss to the Buccaneers, he filled in admirably for Brock Purdy over the last few games. Jones was beaten up by the Buccaneers defense, throwing for 347 yards with two interceptions (75.5 rating) while battling an oblique injury and essentially throwing on one leg. \nThe 49ers offense moved the ball with Jones in the four games he started, and Jones shined without George Kittle, Ricky Pearsall, and a fully healthy Jauan Jennings. The 49ers were beaten and banged up, and lost Fred Warner as part of their casualties. Jones was able to hold the fort anyway. Jones is getting the blame for Sunday's loss, but this isn't on him. He's good enough to start somewhere again. Buccaneers will be the No. 1 seed in the NFCOverreaction or reality: OverreactionThere's a lot -- an awful lot -- to like about the Buccaneers. There is one loss on their resume, and that was to the Super Bowl champion Eagles. They beat the Seahawks and 49ers in consecutive weeks and own the best record in the NFC at 5-1.\nCan the Buccaneers get the No. 1 seed in the conference? This is a conversation they belong in, even with the loss to the Eagles. Even though Tampa Bay is in the NFC South, the schedule is brutal. The Buccaneers play the Lions next week, the Bills in Week 11, and the Rams the following week before the schedule gets easier. The trick for the Buccaneers? Beat the Lions in Detroit to really enhance this conversation, giving another head-to-head tiebreaker to Tampa Bay. The Buccaneers have one of the best teams in the NFC and Baker Mayfield is playing at an MVP level. They are certainly a Super Bowl contender at this stage in the game. Cowboys proved they aren't a playoff teamOverreaction or reality: RealityThere isn't much to say about the Cowboys, who are the definition of mid through six games. Dallas plays in rollercoaster games each and every week, with a defense that can only stop teams named the New York Jets. Every other week, Dak Prescott has had to carry this team to wins -- and really is the only reason Dallas has two victories at this stage in the game. \n\n        \n            \n                Cowboys squander chance to gain ground in suddenly wide-open NFC East thanks to walk-off loss to Panthers\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDallas has only beaten the teams that play in the Meadowlands and are 0-3-1 against everyone else. The Cowboys can't stop the run nor seem to have a clue on how to get a key stop defensively. No matter how well Prescott plays, the stats become empty thanks to the talent on defense (another reason why the Micah Parsons trade made zero sense). Dallas hosts Washington next week, followed by Denver on the road. There's a really good chance the Cowboys can be 2-5-1, which may bury their playoff chances. This was a game the Cowboys had to win -- and didn't. Rico Dowdle is the best running back in the NFLOverreaction or reality: OverreactionWhat Dowdle has done in his two starts has been extremely impressive. A week after having 200+ rushing yards in a win over the Dolphins, Dowdle followed that up with 183 rushing yards and 239 scrimmage yards in a 30-27 victory over the Cowboys. \nIn Dowdle's two starts, he has totaled 389 rushing yards and 84 receiving yards -- 473 total yards of offense. Dowdle is averaging 6.9 yards per carry and has carried Carolina's offense to a pair of wins. If Dowdle starts over Chuba Hubbard when Hubbard returns, it wouldn't be a surprise. Is Dowdle the best running back in football? He's third in the NFL in rushing yards and second among running backs in yards per carry (5.7), taking advantage of two poor rushing defenses in the Dolphins and Cowboys. Dowdle deserves credit for being dominant, but there certainly needs to be a bigger sample size.The Panthers are a player because of Dowdle, and that's all that matters. Ravens can salvage year if Lamar Jackson returns next week Overreaction or reality: OverreactionThe Ravens are 1-5 after scoring just three points against the Rams in another loss, but there is some reason to be encouraged. The defense only gave up 17 points and held the Rams to 4.7 yards per play. The Rams didn't have Puka Nacua for a good portion of the game, but this was a Ravens defense that allowed 37+ points in four games!\nSunday's performance was encouraging, and the Ravens could have some life if Jackson returns from his hamstring injury next week. Cooper Rush was benched for Tyler Huntley as Baltimore had nothing going offensively, a game Baltimore probably wins if Jackson was healthy.Jackson coming back may not matter, as Baltimore is 1-5 and four games behind Pittsburgh in the loss column. They are also three out of the loss column for the final playoff spot in a deep AFC. There may be too much to overcome in Baltimore. Sam Darnold is an MVP candidateOverreaction or reality: RealityNot many quarterbacks have had success against the Jaguars defense this season. That wasn't the case for Darnold, who finished 16 of 27 for 295 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions -- a 121.7 passer rating. Darnold knows who to get the ball to, as Jaxsn Smith-Njigba has eight catches for 162 yards and a score (he's making a case to be the offensive player of the year).\nDarnold has been excellent all season, completing 70.8% of his passes for 1,541 yards with 11 touchdowns to three interceptions for a 116.0 passer rating. He's third in the league in passing yards and second in passer rating heading into the late afternoon slate. To further Darnold's MVP case? On throws of 10+ air yards, Darnold has completed 65.7% of his passes for 1,0009 yards with seven touchdowns to one interception -- a 137.5 passer rating. He's the reason the Seahawks are winning games and a contender in the NFC, and Seattle doesn't lose on the road either (won nine straight). There isn't a clear MVP front runner right now? Why can't Darnold be in the conversation?Dolphins saved Mike McDaniel's job -- even in a lossOverreaction or reality: OverreactionMcDaniel isn't the problem in Miami, as the Dolphins did take the lead over the Chargers with :46 left. The offense has been serviceable with Tua Tagovailoa at quarterback, and the running game is highly efficient no matter who's carrying the ball. The defense is failing McDaniel, which is why the Dolphins have been so bad all year. Once the Dolphins took the lead in the final minute, the defense allowed Ladd McConkey to get 42 yards on a short out, setting the Chargers up for a Cameron Dicker field goal in the final seconds for the win. The Dolphins have allowed 27+ points in all five of their losses. That issue runs deeper than McDaniel, but he'll take the fall for their inefficiency. Not a matter of if, but when McDaniel gets fired. Shedeur Sanders will get a chance to start for Browns this yearOverreaction or reality: RealityDillon Gabriel's second start with the Browns was not good. He finished 29 of 52 for 221 yards with no touchdowns and no interceptions, but take a look at the attempts and yards gained. Gabriel averaged 4.3 yards per attempt in the loss and is averaging just 4.8 yards per attempt on the season.On throws of 10+ air yards on Sunday, Gabriel was 4 of 14 for 51 yards with a 41.3 rating. When Gabriel was pressured, he was 4 of 12 for 13 yards and a 42.4 rating -- 1.1 yards per attempt. Those numbers just aren't good enough for any quarterback in professional football. Gabriel has a long leash in Cleveland, a team that is rebuilding and looking forward to 2026. If this play does continue weekly, Sanders will get a chance to start. At this rate, Gabriel is hurting his chances at starting the remainder of the year. Justin Fields should be benched by the JetsOverreaction or reality: OverreactionSunday's performance by Fields was bad, really bad. Fields finished 9 of 17 for 45 yards with zero touchdowns and zero interceptions, showing little pocket awareness while being sacked nine times. The Jets had -10 net passing yards in the loss to the Broncos, as Fields was 1-for-5 for -1 yards when facing pressure -- -0.2 yards per attempt! The Jets are 0-6 through six games, and the pressure is on Aaron Glenn to change something. Glenn's future as a head coach looks very bleak with his in-game decisions and the way his roster is handled, but should it be at Fields' expense? Fields hasn't been good for the Jets and may be the reason why the offense is so inconsistent week-to-week. Would the Jets be better off with Tyrod Taylor? Probably not with the way this team is run on both sides of the ball. Changes are needed, but that starts up top with Glenn and how he manages his team during the week and in the game. That shouldn't come at the expense of Fields. \n            ",

UAB's decision came just one day after the Blazers dropped to 2-4 on the year in a 53-33 loss to FAU. Dilfer was on track for a third straight losing season with the Blazers. All four of their losses this season came by at least 14 points and only one of their wins came against an FBS opponent. Offensive coordinator Alex Mortensen, who played quarterback at Arkansas and in the NFL with the Tennessee Titans, will serve as interim coach.\"We have made a decision to part ways with head football coach Trent Dilfer,\" UAB athletic director Mark Ingram said in a statement. \"We agree that -- unfortunately -- our on-field performance has not lived up to the standard of winning we have for the program. This decision will allow us to move forward in the best long-term interest of the program.\"Dilfer departs Birmingham with a 9-21 record, including a 6-14 mark in American Conference play. He did not win a single road game in his three years at UAB. The last time the Blazers went that long without a road win was when they did not field a football program from 2015-16. \nPrior to Dilfer taking over, UAB had not had a losing season since 2013. Dilfer's 4-8 record in 2023 also snapped a streak of six-straight bowl appearances for the Blazers. Dilfer was initially hired in 2023 as a full-time replacement for former UAB coach Bill Clark. He came to the Blazers without any prior collegiate coaching experience. A former quarterback at Fresno State and in the NFL, Dilfer did lead Nashville, Tennessee-based college preparatory school Lipscomb Academy from 2019-22. Lipscomb won two straight state titles from 2021-22. \nDilfer played in the NFL from 1994-2007. His career peaked in 2000 when he led the Baltimore Ravens to a win in Super Bowl XXXV. He was also a 1997 Pro Bowl selection and retired in 2008 with 20,518 yards and 113 touchdowns passing. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Kansas City Chiefs (2-3) are set to host the Detroit Lions (4-1) in NFL Week 6 action on 'Sunday Night Football.' Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs are off to a bumpy start this season, and are coming off of a disappointing 31-28 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 5. Meanwhile, Jared Goff and the Lions have won four straight since falling to the Green Bay Packers in Week 1, most recently topping the Cincinnati Bengals 37-24. Kansas City has a clean injury report, while Detroit has ruled seven players out and lists safety Brian Branch (ankle), safety Kerby Joseph (knee) and receiver Kalif Raymond (neck) as questionable. Kickoff from Arrowhead Stadium is set for 8:20 p.m. ET. After opening at -3, Kansas City is now a 2.5-point favorite in the latest Lions vs. Chiefs odds, and the over/under for total points scored is 51.5, up three points from the opener. Before making any Chiefs vs. Lions picks, be sure to see what the SportsLine projection model has to say. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets instantly if your bet wins:The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model is on a sizzling 41-21 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.  Now, the model has zeroed in on Chiefs vs. Lions.

The Lions currently lead the league with 34.8 average points per game thanks to the plethora of offensive weapons Goff has at his disposal. Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery are both averaging over 60 rushing yards per game and will face a Chiefs defense that allows 4.9 yards per carry. The Lions' last trip to Arrowhead ended in an upset, covering the spread as 4-point favorites in that 2023 meeting. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Chiefs can coverKansas City is 2-3-0 ATS this season, but it's hard to bet against a team that has gone 32-10 at home since 2020. Mahomes threw four touchdowns at Arrowhead in Week 4, and will go up against a Lions defense that is dealing with injuries. The Chiefs defense, meanwhile, is only allowing 190.2 passing yards per game, and should be enough to slow a hot Detroit offense that will have Amon-Ra St. Brown (wrist) in the lineup. See which team to back at SportsLine. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to make Chiefs vs. Lions picksFor Sunday Night Football in NFL Week 6, the model is leaning under the total, and also says one side of the spread hits in well over 50% of simulations. See what it is at SportsLine.Who wins Lions vs. Chiefs, and which side of the spread hits well over 50% of the time?

Harrison banged his head on the turf inside Lucas Oil Stadium after a tackle and was slow to get up before being evaluated by team trainers and being taken to the blue injury tent.Playing in his first game at the home of his Pro Football Hall of Fame father who starred in Indianapolis, Harrison walked to the locker room with 6:59 left in the first half after finishing with two catches for 32 yards. This is Harrison's second concussion sustained in the NFL after he suffered his first last season in Week 6, and he'll need to clear the league's mandatory concussion protocol before being cleared to return.With Harrison sidelined for the second half, the Cardinals found the end zone twice on Jacoby Brissett touchdown passes to Trey McBride and Greg Dortch, but it wasn't enough. Jonathan Taylor's 1-yard touchdown run with 4:32 remaining capped a nine-play, 66-yard drive that gave Indianapolis the lead for good at 31-27.\nHarrison, Arizona's top pass-catcher this season with 20 receptions and 306 yards, has been coming on strong after a slow start to the season when he managed only seven catches over his first two games. Harrison said the buzz about his lack of targets was a \"silly conversation\" amid Arizona's unbeaten start, but the Cardinals have since lost four consecutive games.The former No. 4 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft out of Ohio State finished his rookie campaign with 62 catches for 885 yards and eight touchdowns. Arizona's starting quarterback, Kyler Murray, attributed Harrison's lack of involvement in the passing game to simply game plan reasons.\n\"I say it every time, do I wish all of them could get 10 targets a game, of course,\" Murray said last month. \"There's only one ball.  We've been playing this game for a long time. We all understand how it goes. Some days he might get 10, some days he might get three. … You never know.\"\n            \n    ",

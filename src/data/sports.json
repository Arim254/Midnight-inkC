    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Kentucky point guard Jaland Lowe will undergo season-ending shoulder surgery, coach Mark Pope said Monday. It's another brutal blow for one of the nation's most disappointing teams.\"We just finished a long meeting with Jaland Lowe, a really emotional meeting, actually,\" Pope said on The Mark Pope Show. \"... He's dislocated his shoulder three times now. Every time it's been with less and less contact. He's tweaked it in games and tweaked it once in practice to add on top of that. We searched, tried every possible reasonable scenario to have him continue on but just made the wise and right decision today that he'll go have surgery, and so he'll be out for the season. It'll be multiple months -- six months, give or take -- rehab for him to get back to 100 percent health. I don't know if I've seen a guy go through more in such a short span.\"Lowe, a transfer from Pittsburgh, was expected to be a major part of the Wildcats' season, but the shoulder issues have limited him to nine games and two starts. There was a strong three-game stretch in late December and early January in which Lowe averaged 15.7 points and helped lead wins over Indiana and St. John's. But he struggled in last week's loss to Missouri and then played just three minutes in Saturday's win over Mississippi State before re-injuring the shoulder.Overall, Kentucky is and one of the country's most disappointing teams. After being ranked ninth in the preseason AP Poll, the Wildcats sit just 10-6 (1-2 SEC), and they are just 1-5 against ranked opponents. Pope has had to juggle a variety of issues, from inconsistent effort to poor perimeter shooting to injuries. Jayden Quaintance, an Arizona State transfer coming off a torn ACL, has appeared in just four games. Alabama transfer Mouhamed Dioubate missed nearly a month with an ankle injury.\nLowe's injury is a particularly damaging one, though, as he is the only natural point guard on the roster. Pope mentioned Jasper Johnson, a four-star freshman, as one of the players who will need to step up in Lowe's absence. Top scorer Otega Oweh could take on a larger ball-handling role, too.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        A UEFA Women's Champions League superstar and U.S. women's national team captain returns home. Denver Summit FC announced the signing of Colorado native Lindsey Heaps on Monday. The midfielder will join Summit FC following the conclusion of her 2025-26 campaign with OL Lyonnes. The U.S. midfielder has 170 appearances with the USWNT, is a 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup, 2024 Olympic gold, and 2020 Olympic bronze medalist. She has aided the national team in winning multiple Concacaf trophies, won the U.S. Soccer Female Player of the Year in 2021, and was named to he Best FIFA Women's XI in 2024. \"I'm incredibly excited to come home to Colorado and join Denver Summit FC,\" Heaps said. \"This club represents something special, not just for the league, but for this community and for the next generation of players growing up here. I'm fully committed to finishing the season strong with Lyon, and I can't wait to begin this next chapter in Denver this summer.\"A double homecomingHeaps, born in Golden, Colorado, will have a double homecoming of sorts when she returns in the summer -- first to her home state as a product of Colorado's youth system, and also back to the NWSL. \n\"Signing Lindsey Heaps is a defining moment for Denver Summit FC,\" said Denver Summit FC General Manager Curt Johnson. \"She represents the very highest level of excellence as a player, a leader, and a professional. To welcome her back home to Colorado and to have her help shape the identity of this club is incredibly meaningful.\"The 31-year-old midfielder made headlines as a teenager when she turned down her University of North Carolina scholarship to turn pro and start her club career with Paris Saint-Germain in 2012. Following a four-year stint in France, she signed with Portland Thorns FC in 2016 and won several accolades in nearly every season with the club, including the NWSL Shield (2016, 2021), NWSL Championship (2017), NWSL Challenge Cup (2021), and NWSL MVP (2018) before her departure in 2022 to OL Lyonnes.\"Lindsey will bring a world-class level to our team and represents the ambition of this club on-and-off the field,\" said Summit FC Head Coach Nick Cushing. \"Lindsey has won at every level of the game. Her leadership, talent, and professionalism will continue to raise the standard for Summit FC when she arrives this summer. We are thrilled to welcome a hometown player back to Denver as we work to win championships and grow our club and community.\"\nIs Lindsey Heaps the first high-impact player signing?Last month, the league board of governors voted to implement a new mechanism to sign and pay players without affecting the salary cap, called the High-Impact Player rule. It's a new method derived from the ongoing contract saga between U.S. women's national team winger Trinity Rodman and the NWSL. The new rules allow teams to spend an additional $1 million on players who meet specific \"star\" criteria. The ability to offer competitive salaries in a global transfer market rises remains a hurdle for the women's leagues around the world, though the NWSL specifically has seen an increase in players leaving for teams overseas. NWSL clubs will be able to exceed the league's current salary cap by $1 million and use the HIP funds toward single or multiple player contracts. The HIP threshold will also increase annually alongside the salary cap, which is currently $3.5 million and set to rise to $5.1 million by 2030. \nThe HIP rule will be effective as of July 1, but teams and clubs can immediately use the mechanism to sign high-profile athletes as long as contract structures are reflective of the new policy start date. No club has utilized the rule at this time, including Denver, though that could change according to Summit FC general manager Curt Johnson.\"As it relates to our desire to sign Lindsay, this was something that certainly predated the HIP rule,\" Johnson told media.\"So, our intention was to sign Lindsay, then the hip rule came along. We'll certainly work with the league to apply it in the best way we can that will positively impact our salary cap and our roster building.\"Denver's roster is still growing and is far from the 40-player preseason roster deadline due on Wednesday. With Heaps set to join the team during the summer, the club will continue to utilize opportunities to acquire players ahead of their inaugural season. \n\"When a player is assigned the HIP category, the salary cap charge is in the salary cap, and then there's a pool of money outside the salary cap, is how it works,\" Johnson said. \"But we're moving forward with the assumption that this will fall in the HIP category, and hopefully we're moving on to finding our next player that fits that category,\" he said.When will Lindsey Heaps debut for Denver?The midfielder is to join Summit FC following completion of her season with OL Lyonnes, and the NWSL's newest expansion franchise expects the midfielder's arrival in June. She's currently competing with the French side domestically and in the 2025-26 UEFA Women's Champions League.Heaps has already been part of several trophies with the European giants during her time with the club. She's won three Division 1 Féminine titles, a UWCL title, and the Coupe de France Féminine. Her signing is considered a high-profile addition to Denver's expansion roster building.\nWhile the club expects her arrival in June, when she makes her first appearance as a member of Summit FC is another thing entirely. The league has already announced that it will take a summer break during the men's 2026 FIFA World Cup from June 1 through 28. The month-long pause means regular-season games will likely resume the first weekend of July. When will Denver Summit play its first home game?The complete NWSL schedule is set for release at a later date, but the league unveiled a blueprint with key dates. Officially NWSL's 16th franchise, the Denver Summit will play its first game on Saturday, March 28. Billed as \"The Kickoff,\" the club will take the pitch at NFL stadium, Empower Field at Mile High, in Denver. The marquee event is scheduled to be televised on CBS, with the opponent to be announced during the official regular-season schedule announcement. \nWhat's nextThe club continues to build its roster ahead of the 2026 NWSL regular season. While Lindsey Heaps' arrival won't impact the team till the second half of the year, there are still plenty of league-experienced players already on part of Denver's inaugural roster. The club signed free agents Ally Watt and Kaleigh Kurtz, and recently acquired Canadian international Janine Sonis. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Chicago Bears' 31-27 victory over the Green Bay Packers was the best game of Wild Card Weekend. Not only did the Bears outscore the Packers 25-6 in the fourth quarter to advance to the divisional round, but Chicago got to pull off the largest playoff comeback in franchise history in front of its home fans against a hated rival. First-year Bears coach Ben Johnson has embraced the rivalry with the Packers ever since Chicago hired him away from the Detroit Lions last January. In his introductory press conference, Johnson even said, \"I kind of enjoyed beating (Packers coach) Matt LaFleur twice a year.\" It appears that may have been the moment some bad blood was born between the two coaches. Johnson and LaFleur's handshake following the game on Saturday night went viral, as the Bears coach refused to dedicate more than one second of his time to speaking with his rival. \nIn his Monday press conference, Johnson was asked why this Packers rivalry was important to him, or if there was some personal beef with LaFleur. \n\"This is a rivalry,\" Johnson responded, \"And the city of Chicago, Green Bay -- it needs to be a rivalry.\" Johnson was also seen in the locker room screaming, \"F--- the Packers!\" after the emotional victory. He was asked about that comment, and how Bears owner George McCaskey may have viewed it.\"Like I said before, there's a rivalry that exists between these two teams,\" Johnson said. \"Something that I fully recognize and I'm a part of and ... yeah. I just don't like that team. So George and I have talked, and we're on the same page.\"\nHistory of Johnson-LaFleur handshakesThe handshake that Johnson and LaFleur had on Saturday night was actually their third of the season. Their first meeting came in Week 14, when the Packers defeated the Bears, 28-21. This postgame embrace came off a bit icy as well. \nTwo weeks later, the Packers blew a double-digit lead in the fourth quarter on the way to a 22-16 overtime loss to the Bears in Chicago. This was actually the most \"normal\" interaction the two coaches may have had! \nWith the Packers reportedly looking to extend LaFleur this offseason, it looks like we will see more of their handshakes in the future. It doesn't appear there's anything serious about the budding Johnson vs. LaFleur rivalry, other than the fact that they coach two teams that hate each other. We've seen far more dramatic handshakes in the NFL, like when Lions coach Jim Schwartz chased down Jim Harbaugh in 2011.\nThe Bears should be excited that their young coach is fully embracing the Packers rivalry. Johnson's first season is going historically well. Not only did his Bears win the NFC North with an 11-6 record, but the 18-point comeback victory on Saturday was the largest by a first-year coach since George Wilson came back from 20 points down in 1957. No Bears rookie coach had ever won a playoff game before this weekend.Up next for the Bears are Matthew Stafford and the Los Angeles Rams next Sunday in the divisional round.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Philadelphia Eagles' season ended on Sunday thanks to a 23-19 loss at the hands of the San Francisco 49ers. In a season where the Eagles were looking to defend their Super Bowl title, they instead bowed out of the playoffs in the wild card round despite being sizable favorites and playing against an opponent that was missing star players on both sides of the ball.The game itself was marked by some of the same problems that had plagued the Eagles throughout the season, with their inconsistent offense looking unstoppable to start the game but falling apart by the end of it, Jake Elliott uncharacteristically missing kicks, the defense being stingy on the back end but unable to generate consistent pressure up front, and more. Given the way this season went and especially the way it ended, it's important to take a look at what went wrong through the prism of what might happen next. With that in mind, we're going to walk through a few of the key areas that need attention this offseason.The coaching staffBy most measurements, Nick Sirianni is one of the most successful coaches in the NFL. He's 59-26 across his five NFL seasons, giving him a .694 winning percentage that ranks fifth-best all time, according to Pro-Football-Reference, and eighth-best through a coach's first five seasons, according to ESPN's Bill Barnwell. He's 6-4 in the playoffs and he's been to two Super Bowls and won one just a year ago. \nAnd yet, there is constant consternation about Sirianni both inside and outside of Philadelphia, with fans seemingly ready to fire him at the first sign of any underperformance. And there has definitively been underperformance in two of his five seasons, including this one, with those seasons bearing a lot of similarities to each other.It doesn't help that the Eagles have fallen apart at the end of two different seasons, and both times it was in the years when Sirianni promoted an offensive coordinator from within to replace the one who had just taken the team to the Super Bowl, only to see the offense struggle badly down the stretch and especially in the playoffs. The first time around the defense was just not up to the task of carrying the team (in part because of talent deficiencies but also because Sirianni's coordinator hires didn't work out), so once the offense broke down and the wheels just came entirely off, but this time around most of the blame has to be laid at the feet of the offense, because the defense was absolutely good enough to win. And when you're an offensive-minded head coach and the offense breaks down, you're going to catch some heat, even if you're not the primary play caller, which Sirianni wasn't this year.\nThat brings us to offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo, who seemingly just did not have any answers for what ailed the offense this season. He couldn't figure out a way to scheme around the team's various issues, nor to put Jalen Hurts in the best position to succeed. Even Hurts expressed open frustration with the offense at times this season, and given the way things played out on the field during both the regular season and especially in the playoff loss to the 49ers, it isn't hard to see why.We don't yet know whether the Eagles plan to bring back either Sirianni or Patullo. It would frankly be pretty shocking if Patullo were back given the offensive struggles and what we know about the Eagles' willingness to make aggressive changes, particularly at the coordinator positions. Sirianni is a different story. It's hard to make an argument that he's not at least a good coach given the degree of success he's had during his tenure, and teams typically don't move on from good coaches because good coaches are pretty hard to find. But you can also make an argument for trying to find a coach who more definitively gives you a schematic advantage on game days and who can do a better job of finding offensive answers when Plan A breaks down. We know the Eagles are always trying to be ahead of the curve rather than behind it, so Sirianni's future is definitely still something to watch. \nNo matter what they choose to do at head coach, they would be wise to retain defensive coordinator Vic Fangio, who has built one of the better defenses in the NFL over the last two seasons. They need to add more pass rushers to get back to where they were a year ago, but Fangio is an elite defensive coach.\n        \n            \n                Patriots' suddenly dominant defense becomes the biggest wild card of the NFL playoffs\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nA.J. Brown's futureIt was a contentious season for Brown in Philly, and that continued on Sunday with his sideline interaction with Sirianni, his rough performance in the game itself and finally his refusal to speak with the media following the loss. Brown hugged his teammates in the locker room and then left without taking questions, per the Philly Voice.Trade rumors swirled around Brown even during the season as the Eagles were chasing back-to-back Super Bowls, and it would be surprising if those rumors didn't pick up this offseason, given where it looks like the relationship between the two sides is at this point. However, there are several things to consider when it comes to potential Brown trades. \nThe first is that the Eagles don't really have anybody to replace him. They have DeVonta Smith, of course, but their depth chart is thin beyond the top two: all they have beyond the Brown-Smith duo is Jahan Dotson (who is set to be a free agent), Darius Cooper, Britain Covey and then Johnny Wilson on injured reserve. That's at least part of why the target tree has been so concentrated over the last few years. They could of course target a potential replacement with whatever draft compensation they received in a trade, but the original Brown trade to Philadelphia proves how risky that is. The second is the financial implications. Brown's three-year contract extension signed in April 2024 hasn't even kicked in yet. He's under contract through 2029, but also has five void years tacked onto the end of his deal, per Over the Cap. If the Eagles were to trade him prior to June 1, they would be taking on a $43.4 million dead cap hit, costing themselves just over $20 million compared with the hit that would come from keeping Brown on the team. A post-June 1 trade is more financially feasible, but even that would save the Eagles only $7 million on their books for 2026. That makes trading him this offseason incredibly complicated. (Cutting him is obviously a non-starter.)The third is that while Brown remains very good, his performance did tail off slightly this year. He caught 78 passes and went over 1,000 yards once again, but he posted career-worst marks in yards per route, per target and per reception, as well as yards after catch per reception and first downs per route and per target. To be clear, his numbers in those categories were still quite good; he finished 22nd in the NFL in yards per route, for example. But when you usually check in within the top five and drop outside the top 20, there could be some minor cause for concern moving forward.\nAll that being said, if the Eagles do put Brown on the market, there are sure to be plenty of suitors for a 29-year-old (he turns 29 in June) wideout who has consistently shown that he is among the very best players in the league at his position. The bigger question is whether the Eagles should really be considering it, or whether they should instead be figuring out a way to mend fences, which would almost certainly be better for the Eagles on the field.The running gameIn 2024, the Eagles dominated on the ground because their run game was both efficient and explosive thanks to the league's best offensive line and a superstar running back who was in the best situation of his career. They averaged 4.9 yards per carry overall, and 5.3 yards per carry on running back runs. Because the offensive line was so good, the Eagles led the NFL in yards before contact per carry, according to TruMedia, and because Saquon Barkley was so good, he ripped off 30 explosive runs, which ranked third in the NFL.\nThis year, none of those figures lived up to where they were the previous season. Philly averaged 4.2 yards per carry overall and 4.4 per carry on running back runs. Amid offensive line injuries and under-performance, the Eagles' yards before contact per carry average dropped by more than three-quarters of a yard and Barkley dipped to 20 explosive runs, which ranked ninth in the league. Figuring out a way to get back to where they were last season is going to be highly important. Some of the improvement can come from the offensive line being healthier. Lane Johnson and Landon Dickerson were injured on and off throughout the season and combined to miss 10 games and played hurt in several others. Getting them up to full health and full speed will help. But that also can't be the only part of the plan. Depending on Barkley to be the guy he was in 2024 probably isn't reasonable. He's going to be 29 next season, an age by which running backs are typically slowing down. Barkley is obviously not your typical running back, but he's also got a lot of tread on his tires at this point and probably needs to be spelled more often than he was this year and last. Finding a complementary back who can rip off explosive runs on occasion, whether that's Tank Bigsby (who flashed at times this year but hasn't been particularly explosive in his career), Will Shipley or someone else, is something the Eagles should be thinking about.\nThe salary capThe Eagles are currently set to enter the offseason with $20.3 million in cap space, according to Over the Cap. Several important players are set to hit free agency this offseason: Dallas Goedert, Reed Blankenship, Jaelan Phillips and Nakobe Dean are chief among them. They will almost certainly restructure or extend multiple contracts to create more room, and they could add void years to other deals to spread out cap hits even more. Players including Goedert (on a new deal that replaces his void years), Jordan Davis and Jalen Carter could get new deals and save some money against the cap, for example. Plus, the contracts for Hurts, Johnson, Jordan Mailata, Smith, Barkley, Dickerson, Zack Baun and Cam Jurgens already have minimal base salaries, but they could convert some option bonuses to signing bonus and spread some of that money out over the remaining years of their respective deals.According to Over the Cap, the Eagles can create between $99 million and $118 million in cap room with simple or maximum restructures. They almost surely won't restructure every possible deal that they can but they will likely cut ties with other players to create additional room, so they should have plenty of money available to conduct their offseason business.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Mark Cuban is striking while the iron's hot, donating a piece of his empire to Indiana football in hopes on ensuring another quality season in 2026. The Indiana alumnus envisioned greatness under Curt Cignetti when he previously gave to the program, but nothing like this as the unbeaten and top-ranked Hoosiers enter next Monday night's College Football Playoff National Championship against Miami.Indiana's wealthiest NIL donor, Cuban increased his giving during Cignetti's second season knowing the leader of the program's process has worked. When there's mention of return on investment, this is it.\"They earned it,\" Cuban said on Sideline Stories. \"The first time it was like, OK, let's see what happens … the second time, we know it works. I talked to them about different players and what their strategy was. The previous year, it all made sense and I wanted to be part of it.\"\n        \n            \n                Indiana flirting with all-time great status as Hoosiers plow through Oregon, into CFP National Championship\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhile Cuban didn't reveal how much money he gave toward Indiana's NIL efforts, he did say it would be enough to buy Kilroy's on Kirkwood, a popular off-campus bar in Bloomington.\n\"Everybody talks about we don't have any five-stars, but where that's important is when they ask me for money, it was like I'm not going to give you money just so you can bid the highest for everybody,\" Cuban said. \"It's like the NBA salary cap. You've got to be able to fit in slots and find the guys who know their roles. That's where [Cignetti]'s been a stud. In basketball, you've got to know your role. Not everybody can be the star. \"Something that Fernando Mendoza said about him being recruited really stood out. He said when he talked about Coach Cig about winning the Heisman, he said quarterbacks don't win Heismans, teams win Heismans. If you don't have the offensive line, the receivers, the system … you're not going to get it done.\"Cuban's 2026 donation is going toward funding a group ranked No. 10 nationally in the transfer portal and includes the additions of quarterback Josh Hoover, receiver Nick Marsh and edge rusher Tobi Osunsanmi.\nThe billionaire and minority owner in the Dallas Mavericks is expected to be in attendance for the national championship game after watching the semifinal victory over Oregon from the sideline in Atlanta. Cuban used his personal account and social media reach of more than 8.5 million followers to ask about CFP title game ticket prices -- as if he needs to worry about the base price of a \"get-in\" ticket.\n            ",

This Steelers team ranks in the top five in both turnover differential and in sack differential, making it one of two NFL teams that can make that claim. Pittsburgh will welcome back DK Metcalf from suspension, and he has four touchdowns over his last two playoff games.

    "body": "\n        Texas' perfect start to the season came to an end Sunday with a narrow loss to LSU in Baton Rouge, which prompted a postgame rant from Longhorns coach Vic Schaefer in which he complained about playing LSU and South Carolina back-to-back on the road and claimed the SEC has a \"vendetta\" against his program. The Longhorns' loss leaves three remaining undefeated teams: No. 1 UConn, No. 5 Vanderbilt and No. 17 Texas Tech. While the Huskies have previously recorded six perfect seasons -- an all-time record -- the Commodores and Lady Raiders are both off to the best starts in program history. There's little debate that UConn has the best chance to be the last remaining undefeated team this season, especially given the state of the Big East. Thus, a more interesting question is trying to figure out the first loss for these three teams. Here is when our experts expect each of these teams to lose their first game of the season. No. 1 UConn (18-0)Jack Maloney: NeverThe Huskies have led by at least 20 points in every single game this season and boast a plus-52.5 net rating. They have the best defense in the country (71.3 defensive rating), the best player in the country (Sarah Strong) and the best coach in the country (Geno Auriemma). No one on their remaining regular season schedule can challenge them, and they are rightfully the heavy favorite to win it all. \nIsabel Gonzalez: NeverI said during preseason that I think UConn will go undefeated and I still believe that. UConn's toughest opponents remaining in the regular season are Notre Dame and Tennessee, but the Huskies get to play both of those games in Connecticut.Erica Ayala: NeverTennessee and Notre Dame are the only remaining ranked opponents for the Huskies before the Big East conference tournament where i expect Connecticut to come out on top again. Neither Tennessee nor Notre Dame have been consistent teams and UConn should be able to handle both in the coming weeks. Lindsay Gibbs: NeverUnlike many of my colleagues, I did not expect the Huskies to go undefeated this season, but they made it through the nonconference schedule unscathed and are just so much better than every other Big East team that I just simply don't see them losing before the NCAA tournament. I think the biggest threat is against Notre Dame on Jan. 19 -- the Fighting Irish have been maddeningly inconsistent this season, but Hannah Hidalgo has the type of talent that can take over and rattle even the most elite opponents. But it won't be enough.\nNo. 5 Vanderbilt (17-0)Maloney: Jan. 25 at South CarolinaThe Commodores have tied the best start in program history, thanks to an elite offense led by Mikayla Blakes and strong 3-point shooting, but it's unlikely they'll remain undefeated for long. Their next five contests include a neutral site game against No. 8 Michigan and road trips to No. 2 South Carolina and No. 16 Ole Miss. While they have what it takes to beat Michigan at a neutral venue, it's hard to see them knocking off South Carolina, who hasn't lost a home SEC game since 2019. Gonzalez: Jan. 19 vs. MichiganThe Wolverines' only two losses this season have been to No. 1 UConn and Washington, a team that has gone in and out of the rankings. Michigan has multiple scoring threats and could provide Vanderbilt a tough challenge on a neutral court.Ayala: Jan. 19 vs. MichiganI expect this to be a well contested, close game but ultimately I have a likely underrated and overlooked Wolverines seizing the opportunity to prove they are a formidable opponent. \nGibbs: Jan. 29 at Ole MissIn the next two weeks, Vanderbilt has two massive tests, on a neutral court against No. 8 Michigan on Jan. 19 and on the road against the South Carolina Gamecocks on Jan. 25, and I predict the Commodores are going to make waves by winning both of those games. However, they will have a hard time following up their South Carolina upset and will fall in their next game against No. 16 Ole Miss on the road.No. 17 Texas Tech (18-0)Maloney: Jan. 21 at BYUThe Lady Raiders, who are off to the best start in program history, are easily the biggest surprise among the remaining undefeated teams. With respect to what they've accomplished, they only have three wins against teams in the top-50 in NET rankings (Mississippi State, Baylor and West Virginia) and those were by a combined 13 points. Later this month, they have a road trip to Utah to take on BYU and Utah in the span of four days. It's hard to see them emerging from that journey unscathed. Gonzalez: Jan. 24 at UtahWe don't talk enough about how competitive the Big 12 is. The Utes already showed how dangerous they are when they took TCU to overtime earlier this month and handed the Horned Frogs their first loss of the season. \nAyala: Jan. 28 vs. Iowa StateI like Isabel's pick, but I think Texas Tech gets through Utah but struggles against Iowa State. The Cyclones have lost their last three games, but I expect them to reestablish their groove soon. Gibbs: Jan. 24 at UtahTexas Tech deserves a world of credit for making it this far in the season without a loss, and I actually think their surprising run of perfection will continue for another few games, until they face Utah on the road on Jan. 24. Utah is 6-0 in the Big 12 and 6-2 at home this season, and Utah's three-point shooting will get the best of the Lady Raiders at last.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 PGA Tour schedule gets underway at the 2026 Sony Open in Hawaii on Thursday, Jan. 15. The season opener at Waialae Country Club in Honolulu comes a week later than normal after The Sentry was cancelled this year due to course concerns. That means there will be just one event on the Hawaii Swing this year, and some top players decided not to make the trip. Big names like Collin Morikawa, Hideki Matsuyama, J.J. Spaun and Jordan Spieth, however, are among the golfers who are teeing it up this week.The latest 2026 Sony Open odds from DraftKings Sportsbook list Russell Henley as the +1100 favorite. Matsuyama and Ben Griffin are at +1700, followed by Spaun at +1800. Before locking in any 2026 Sony Open picks, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up over $8,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.This same model has also nailed a whopping 16 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- as well as this year's PGA Championship and Open Championship. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting sites. \nNew users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Now that the 2026 Sony Open field is locked in, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard. 2026 Sony Open predictions One major surprise the model is calling for at the 2026 Sony Open: Russell Henley, the betting favorite, stumbles and barely finishes inside the top 5. He's a golfer to avoid this week. The 2013 Sony Open champion hasn't been able to follow up on that success at this event with regularity. Since that time, he's missed the cut twice and has three other finishes outside the top 30. Last year, he finished T10. He's played just once since last year's playoffs and finished 19th at the Procore Championship, so the model doesn't love his value as a favorite this year. See who else to fade here. \nAnother surprise: J.J. Spaun, a +2000 longshot, makes a strong run at the title. He's a target for anyone looking for a huge payday. The 2025 U.S. Open winner finished T3 in this event last year. He also brings some momentum into the new year after playing three times in the fall and finishing no worse than T11 in those tournaments. The model has identified him as a top-three contender this week, making him a golfer to back in your Sony Open best bets. See who else to pick here. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:How to make 2026 Sony Open picksThe model also has identified three golfers with odds of +2500 or higher as top-10 contenders.

    "body": "\n        This week provides us with one of the more lopsided schedules all season, even featuring a rare five-game week for the Lakers. Four teams will only go around twice, those being the Pistons, Grizzlies, Bucks, and Magic. That leaves 12 teams with four games and 13 teams with three games.Sitting players who only go two or three times has its advantages, but fantasy managers still have to make smart decisions when figuring out whom to play, regardless of game count. Being aware of back-to-back sets is also a key factor, especially with so many teams now sitting players due to injury management.Five Games: LALFour Games: BKN, CHA, CHI, DAL, DEN, HOU, IND, NOP, POR, SAC, TOR, UTAThree Games: ATL, BOS, CLE, GSW, LAC, MIA, MIN, NYK, OKC, PHI, PHO, SAS, WASTwo Games: DET, MEM, MIL, ORL, Here are four potential starts and four potential sits entering the thirteenth week of the NBA season. Just keep in mind that this is based on games played for the week. If you play in a rotisserie league, the number of games played each week may not matter in your format.GuardsConsider starting: Marcus Smart, LALOpponents: @SAC, ATL, CHA, @POR, TORAlthough Smart's per-game numbers haven't taken the world by storm, he has quietly carved out a consistent starting role over the past few weeks. As we have come to expect from Smart, his overall fantasy value is limited to just a couple of categories, those being steals and assists. In six games over the past two weeks, he has averaged 1.7 steals and 3.7 assists in 31.9 minutes per game. With five games tabled for the next seven days, Smart's streaming appeal could eventuate into a starter-level player. If assists and steals are on the agenda for your team, Smart could hypothetically deliver up to 10 steals and 20 assists.\nConsider starting: TJ McConnell, INDOpponents: BOS, TOR, NOP, @DETMuch like Smart, McConnell's value is tied up in assists and steals. However, he has stepped up on the offensive end in recent times, scoring double digits in four of the past five games, including a 23-point explosion in a win over the Hornets. Unlike Smart, McConnell's role is a little more temperamental, typically playing minutes in the high-teens. His floor is relatively safe at this point, even more so if Andrew Nembhard continues to deal with injuries. Consider getting McConnell into your starting lineup, again, if you are looking for assists and steals.Consider sitting: Miles McBride, NYKOpponents: @SAC, @GSW, PHOMcBride has been able to put together a nice stretch of production over the past two weeks, largely since Josh Hart has been sidelined with an ankle injury. In seven games during that time, McBride has been a top 50 player in standard leagues, averaging 16.6 points, 1.1 steals, and 3.7 3-pointers. However, Hart returned to action Sunday, cutting into McBride's playing time. While he is probably worth holding, at least for another few games, holding him on your bench might be a safer option, especially with only three games coming up.ForwardsConsider starting: Jake LaRavia, LALOpponents: @SAC, ATL, CHA, @POR, TORLaRavia, like Smart, has also been starting for the Lakers, assuming that role for the past six games. In that time, he has averaged 15 points, 5.3 rebounds, two steals, and 2.5 3-pointers, flirting with top-30 value in standard leagues. The return of Rui Hachimura will have some sort of an impact, although it remains to be seen whether LaRavia will remain in the starting lineup. If we're being honest, there is certainly a case to be made for LaRavia being a better option than Hachimura, although that is neither here nor there. With five games coming up, even if LaRavia shifts to the bench, he should be able to do enough across the board to hold value in 12-team leagues.\nConsider sitting: Bobby Portis, MILOpponents: MIN, @SASAfter a brief run of relevance, Portis has seen his overall production scale back in recent times. In three games last week, Portis averaged just 8.5 points and nine rebounds, leaving him outside the top 200 in standard leagues. His playing time continues to fluctuate on a nightly basis, meaning he could play anywhere from 16 to 30 minutes on any given night. His value is reliant on points and rebounds, and honestly, even his points production is serviceable, at best. This one is quite simple. Two games of Portis are not enticing enough to have him in your starting lineup.Consider sitting: Ausar Thompson, DETOpponents: PHO, INDAlthough Thompson has stepped things up on the defensive end of the floor, his role continues to be a source of frustration for managers. Injuries to other players have helped over the past week, with Thompson putting up top 70 value in three games during that period, averaging nine points, six rebounds, 3.3 assists, and four combined steals and blocks. However, relying on the absence of others, especially when the Pistons only have two games, feels like a risky game to play. Unless you are simply looking for steals and blocks, Thompson should be just fine spending another week on your bench.CentersConsider starting: Jalen Smith, CHIOpponents: @HOU, UTA, @BKN, BKNAlthough Smith was far from outstanding in his return from a concussion, the writing is potentially on the wall, in a good way, when it comes to his role. Prior to his absence, Smith had started in three straight games alongside Nikola Vucevic, averaging 11.3 points, 9.7 rebounds, and three combined steals and blocks. During his hiatus, the Bulls were dreadful, losing three straight games in convincing fashion. Assuming you can absorb some risk, quietly sliding Smith into your starting lineup this week could be a stroke of genius.\nConsider sitting: Myles Turner, MILOpponents: MIN, @SASTurner continues to be arguably the most disappointing player this season, struggling on both ends of the floor. No matter how you look at his numbers, there is certainly no way to sugar-coat it. In 13 games over the past month, he is barely a top 150 player in standard leagues, averaging 12.5 points, 4.8 rebounds, 1.3 blocks, and 2.2 3-pointers. He remains a soft hold, simply because of his proven upside. However, moving him to your bench this week is a no-brainer.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The WNBA and the Women's National Basketball Players Association have entered a period of \"status quo\" after the 2020 collective bargaining agreement expired on Friday without a new deal or another extension. Though a work stoppage is now a possibility, both sides have signaled a desire to continue negotiations. \"The current Collective Bargaining Agreement has expired, and negotiations with the Women's National Basketball Players Association remain ongoing,\" the league said in a statement on Friday. \"As the league experiences a pivotal time of unprecedented popularity and growth, we recognize the importance of building upon that momentum. Our priority is a deal that significantly increases player salaries, enhances the overall player experience, and supports the long-term growth of the league for current and future generations of players and fans.\"   \n        \n            \n                Breanna Stewart says WNBA, WNBPA won't reach a CBA deal by Friday deadline, will enter 'status quo' period\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhile there is still plenty of time for the two sides to get a new deal done without delaying the 2026 season, the offseason has already been interrupted. The Toronto Tempo and Portland Fire, the two expansion teams set to join the league in 2026, have not been able to hold their expansion draft yet, and will be unable to do so until a new CBA is in place. Additionally, what will be the busiest and most important free agency period in league history should be getting underway right now. But with no CBA in place, there is plenty of uncertainty on all sides. As CBA negotiations continue, here's a look at what's happening with free agency. \nWhen would free agency typically take place?Free agency typically begins in mid-January, and most of the big moves are usually wrapped up by mid-February. Here's a look at last year's key dates:Jan. 11-20: Teams are allowed to make qualifying offers and \"Core player\" designationsJan. 21-31: Teams are allowed to negotiate with free agentsFeb. 1: Players are allowed to sign contracts and offer sheetsTeams that are caught skirting those rules will be punished under the league's tampering policies. Most recently, the Seattle Storm were fined in 2022 for announcing they had re-signed Sue Bird prior to the official start of free agency. Why is this year's free agency period so important?When the 2020 CBA was ratified, it included an opt-out clause for both sides after the 2024 season. Players and their agents have known that an opt-out was a real possibility for a number of years, and have moved strategically in free agency to ensure they were prepared if it happened. \nNow, every single veteran (a player not on a rookie-scale contract) aside from Kalani Brown and Lexie Brown is a free agent this winter. All of these players will be able to sign new deals under the new CBA, which will bring with it significant pay raises. We won't know the 2026 numbers until a new CBA is in place, but the league's latest proposal shows exactly why so many players wanted to be free agents this winter. The minimum salary would more than triple, the average salary would more than quadruple and the max would more than quintuple, a source close to the situation told CBS Sports. Here's a look at the differences between 2025 and 2026 under the league's prosposal:\nSeasonSalary capMinimum salaryAverage salaryMax salary2025$1.5 million$66,079$120,000$249,244 2026$5 million~$230,000~$530,000$1.3 millionNever have so many stars hit unrestricted free agency at the same time. For reference, eight of the 10 players who received All-WNBA honors last season are free agents, including the entire First Team. If you look at the All-Star rosters, 19 of the 25 players in Indianapolis last summer are free agents. Add in dozens of role players, the arrival of two new teams, and the fact that so many players are currently in Miami with Unrivaled, and rosters could look significantly different from last season. \"It's really not recruiting,\" Kahleah Copper said, via Front Office Sports, when asked if players have been talking with each other about free agency. \"Yesterday after practice we just sat in the locker room and talked general free agency, where we thought people would go, what teams we thought would break up, what people are chasing, what are you looking for. … We all kind of play GM with each other.\" What happens without a CBA in place?If a work stoppage occurs, all league business would cease, including free agency. Again, though, neither side appears eager to take that step -- at least right now. It is worth noting, however, that the WNBPA voted in December to authorize a strike \"if necessary.\" During a status quo period, the working conditions of the previous CBA remain in place. Thus, as long as status quo continues, free agency can technically proceed. However, on Monday, sources confirm to CBS Sport that the WNBA and WNBPA officially agreed to a moratorium on league business. Prior to that announcement, there was a bit of confusion about the state of free agency.According to ESPN, the league informed teams last week that they should prepare to continue business as usual and send out qualifying offers and core designations under the conditions of the expired CBA. Of course, it makes no sense for players to sign any offers when they're on the verge of a major pay raise. WNBPA vice president Breanna Stewart told reporters in Miami during Unrivaled last week that there is an \"understanding\" among the players not to sign anything right now. \nThere's no point in going through the motions of free agency if no player is going to sign anything, which is why both sides agreed to the moratorium.What is a moratorium?A moratorium pauses all league business, including free agency, and save everyone the hassle of dealing with pointless paperwork and negotiations during the height of the most important CBA negotiations in league history. Per ESPN, the league put a moratorium proposal in writing on Friday. Free agency should resume whenever a new CBA is ratified, with a timeline to be determined. When could a new CBA be in place?While there's still time to get a new deal done to ensure the 2026 season starts in mid-May as usual, there is not unlimited time. It's still unclear exactly when a new CBA will be in place, but Stewart told Sarah Spain on her podcast last week that both sides want to have things wrapped up by the end of the month. \n\"Hopefully, everything can be done by February 1,\" Stewart said. \"Even if we agree, we still have to wait for the contracts to be written. So there's a lot to be thinking about. It's not just like, oh, you're done now, it'll work. If we can get by February 1, we'll all be in a good place.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        In a strange twist of fate, those whose headline-making departures from the PGA Tour legitimized LIV Golf four years ago find themselves in a unique position to end it for good. When the PGA Tour announced on Monday that it had created a new pathway for Brooks Koepka to return to the PGA Tour, it accomplished more than welcoming back one of the game's brightest stars.Koepka left LIV Golf a few days before Christmas, citing that he wanted to spend more time with his family in 2026. The split was mutual, according to a league statement that primarily boasted Talor Gooch's impending captaincy of Smash GC, the LIV Golf team Koepka previously led.The PGA Tour responded to Koepka's decision by releasing a statement within minutes of his departure, calling the player a \"highly accomplished professional\" while stating the tour \"continues to offer the best professional golfers the most competitive, challenging and lucrative environment in which to pursue greatness.\"Internal conversations were held. PGA Tour CEO Brian Rolapp met with Koepka on multiple occasions. Meetings took place. A new pathway was concocted out of thin air. Majority approval was achieved, and on Monday, membership was made aware of the reinstatement decision. All of this transpired in a three-week window during the holidays leading into the start of the 2026 season.\nIn doing so, the PGA Tour not only opened an expedited pathway for Koepka to return without serving a year-long suspension, it created an opportunity to deal a massive blow to its rival, one from which it may not be able to recover.Koepka's journey back to the PGA Tour may well serve as a returned knife in the back of LIV Golf -- considering the league previously poached the big-swinging Floridian -- but it's not a death blow. That opportunity belongs to three other players who are now suddenly eligible to come back through the PGA Tour's Returning Membership Program: Bryson DeChambeau, Jon Rahm and Cameron Smith.Whether any or all choose to take the PGA Tour up on its offer is anyone's best guess, of course.\nRahm's lucrative contract started towards the end of 2023, and it could be a bear to extricate himself from it, even if he wished, which some have suggested he does.DeChambeau is up for negotiations and could become the richest golfer to ever walk on this planet if he plays his cards right. Phil Mickelson once described working with LIV Golf as a once-in-a-lifetime leverage opportunity. That word, \"leverage?\" DeChambeau has in spades.Smith seems intent on remaining where he plays alongside his fellow Australians with a laidback schedule, but a PGA Tour return cannot be ruled out, either, particularly if some other top-level players depart ahead of him.\nWithout those three, what would be left of LIV Golf?A bunch of (mostly) has-beens traveling the world, participating in a rowdy tournament in Australia that is considered the event of year yet comes across as more of a concert than golf event? Players like Joaquin Niemann, Patrick Reed and Tyrell Hatton stranded in what can only be described as no man's land? Oh, the teams. How could we forget about The Crushers? They may be EBITDA positive, but would they be without DeChambeau?These were not questions being asked three weeks ago as LIV Golf and its backers, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, long ago decided they would spend whatever money was necessary to keep the league afloat. But with DeChambeau, Rahm and Smith now having a deadline of Feb. 2 -- two days before LIV Golf kicks off its season -- to decide on their future, sport-defining change could come swiftly.After four years of an intersport battle that has split golf -- involving defections, pointless meetings, grand proclamations, flash mobs, weird messages to set up even weirder announcements and a lot of grandstanding with little to show for it -- it could all come down to these next three weeks.\nThe ball is officially in the court of DeChambeau, Rahm and Smith, and it's the PGA Tour who handed it to them.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Buffalo Bills wide receiver Gabe Davis tore his ACL in the Bills' 27-24 wild card round win over the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday, coach Sean McDermott said Monday. Davis' season is over.Davis, 26, returned to Buffalo this season after spending last season with the Jaguars. He didn't make his season debut until Week 11 but quickly took a prominent role in the receiver rotation. He started five of the Bills' final eight games and finished the regular season with 12 catches for 129 yards.Davis caught two of three targets for 14 yards against Jacksonville on Sunday before taking a nasty hit to his knee early in the fourth quarter. He was helped to the sideline and then eventually carted off the field. He had played roughly half of Buffalo's snaps to that point.\n        \n            \n                2026 NFL playoff schedule and bracket: Dates, times, TV for every round from divisional to Super Bowl\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nNicknamed \"Big Game Gabe\" for his previous playoff performances -- including a four-touchdown game against the Kansas City Chiefs four years ago -- Davis was one of several Bills who got banged up ahead of a divisional round matchup against the Denver Broncos, and his injury puts an already struggling receiver unit in more trouble.\nBills receiver situation vs. BroncosBuffalo has been rolling with a by committee receiver approach all season, though the members of that committee often rotate.Khalil Shakir has been the one constant. The slot man played on 71% of Buffalo's offensive snaps against Jacksonville, the highest of any receiver. He finished with 12 catches for 82 yards; no other player had more than three catches.Tyrell Shavers (54% snap share) and Brandin Cooks (48%) were next in line. Cooks had three catches for 58 yards, including a crucial 36-yarder on the game-winning drive. Cooks, a midseason addition, has been up and down in his short time in Buffalo, seemingly alternating big plays and drops. Shavers had one catch for 14 yards, and he also suffered a knee injury the Bills are still evaluating, McDermott said.\nThe only other receiver with a catch was Keon Coleman, who brought in his lone target for a 36-yard gain. Coleman, the 2024 second-round pick who was a healthy scratch at times this season, played 43% of Buffalo's offensive snaps. He was only active Sunday because Josh Palmer (ankle) was unable to play; Palmer was ultimately placed on injured reserve.With Davis and Palmer out and Shavers dealing with an injury, Coleman's role could increase. He's a big body (6-foot-4, 215 pounds) who has flashed the ability to win 50-50 balls but struggled with consistency throughout his brief career.The Bills also opened the practice window for Curtis Samuel, who has not played since mid-November due to neck and elbow injuries. It remains to be determined whether he will be able to play. \nCurrently, Buffalo has just four healthy wide receivers on its active roster: Shakir, Cooks, Coleman and Shavers. Mecole Hardman and Stephen Gosnell are on the practice squad. Hardman has appeared in just two games this season while battling injuries, and Gosnell has never appeared in an NFL game.\n            ",

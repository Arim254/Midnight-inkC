Last week, the Ravens snapped a four-game losing streak with a 30-16 victory over the Bears, coming out of their bye week. Quarterback Lamar Jackson has missed the last three games for the Ravens due to a hamstring injury, but he's expected to play on Thursday. The Dolphins, meanwhile, are coming off a 34-10 win over the Falcons last week behind four touchdown passes by Tua Tagovailoa. The Ravens are 7.5-point favorites, according to the latest Dolphins vs. Ravens odds, while the over/under for total points scored is 51.5. Lamar Jackson's over/under for total passing yards is 232.5, and his over/under for total rushing yards is 37.5.There are dozens of betting options if you're wondering how to bet on the NFL, or more specifically, Ravens vs. Dolphins.

Jackson suffered his hamstring injury in Week 4 in a 37-20 loss to the Chiefs, and Baltimore went 1-2 in the last three weeks that he didn't start. Although the Dolphins are coming off a 34-10 win last week, that came against a 37-year-old Kirk Cousins making his first start of the season, and he was without his WR1 in Drake London (hip). Miami allowed at least 27 points in its prior three games, all losses against the Panthers, Chargers and Browns, as the majority of those teams don't strike much fear in opposing defenses. With Jackson back, the model expects the Ravens offense to have strong success on Thursday. The model projects the Ravens to cover in 52% of simulations.Over 51.5 pointsThe Ravens and Dolphins both have bottom-six scoring defenses in the NFL this season, with Baltimore ranking 30th at 30 points per game allowed, and Miami ranking tied for 26th at 26.9 ppg allowed this year. Both units played well last week, with the Ravens holding the Bears to 16 points and the Dolphins holding the Falcons to 10 points, but the statistics indicate that's more of an anomaly than the norm. The Dolphins have allowed at least 27 points in six of eight games, including four contests allowing more than 30 points, and the Ravens have allowed at least 37 points in four of seven games this season. Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa threw four touchdowns against an Atlanta defense that was strong against the pass over the first seven weeks, and with Jackson back on Thursday, this contest has shootout potential. The model projects the Over to hit in 68% of simulations.Responsible gamingResponsible gaming is a serious topic, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users play responsibly.

He did so in style with this explosive 35-yard run late in the third quarter.\nEvery eligible running back that has rushed for at least 12,000 yards has a gold jacket and bronze bust. The 31-year-old Henry is once again rubbing shoulders with some of the best running backs in NFL history, joining a list that includes Jim Brown, Walter Payton, Barry Sanders and Emmitt Smith, among others. NFL's 12,000-yard rushers PlayerYards1.

He recently passed Payton for fifth all-time in touchdown runs (112). He is now one of just eight players in NFL history with at least 100 rushing touchdowns and 12,000 rushing yards. Last year, Henry's 1,921 rushing yards was the most ever for a player over the age of 30. It's also the most yards in league history for a player who did not win the rushing title. A Heisman Trophy winner at Alabama, Henry's other NFL accolades include consecutive rushing titles and becoming the ninth player in history to rush for more than 2,000 yards in a season. \nWhile it has been undervalued in recent years, Henry is proof that the running back position is still very much alive and well. \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Teams with two wins apiece will meet on 'Thursday Night Football,' with a two-time MVP back on the NFL player props market. Ravens vs. Dolphins on TNF will mark the return of Lamar Jackson (hamstring) after he missed the last three games. He will be a central figure with NFL prop bets but not the only player of high interest with 'Thursday Night Football' props. Big names like Derrick Henry, Tua Tagovailoa, De'Von Achane and Jaylen Waddle all have interesting lines to wager on for the opener of Week 9, as Baltimore is favored by 7.5 points, and the total is 51.5 points.No team has allowed more rushing yards to opposing running backs than the Dolphins, as they're allowing 128.3 yards to running backs alone. However, Miami just held Bijan Robinson to 25 yards on the ground, which makes backing the Over of Henry's NFL prop total of 89.5 rushing yards no sure thing. Additionally, Jackson's return could affect the future Hall of Fame running back's usage. So, before betting any Dolphins vs. Ravens props for 'Thursday Night Football,' you need to see the Ravens vs. Dolphins prop predictions powered by SportsLine's Machine Learning AI.New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:Built using cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques by SportsLine's Data Science team, AI Predictions and AI Ratings are generated for each player prop. For Dolphins vs. Ravens   NFL betting on 'Thursday Night Football,' the Machine Learning Model  has evaluated the NFL player prop odds and provided Ravens vs. Dolphins prop picks. You can only see the Machine Learning Model player prop predictions for Miami vs. Baltimore here.Top NFL player prop bets for Dolphins vs. Ravens  After analyzing the Ravens vs. Dolphins props and examining the dozens of NFL player prop markets, the SportsLine's Machine Learning Model  says Jackson goes Under 230.5 passing yards (-114 at FanDuel). It's fair to assume that Jackson will be a bit rusty after missing a month of action, and he's played conservatively after missing games previously. He threw for just 165 yards in his first game back after an illness kept him out of a 2021 game, and he had only 107 passing yards in his first game back after being on the COVID-19 list for a 2020 game.Miami's defense will also contribute to Jackson hitting the Under as defending through the air is one of the few strengths of the Dolphins. They allow fewer than 200 passing yards per game as they prevent the big play with just 10.3 yards allowed per completion, which is seventh-fewest in the NFL. Meanwhile, just three teams give up more yards per rush than Miami (5.0), so look for Baltimore to lean on its ground game instead of an aerial attack. Jackson's projected to have 189.8 passing yards in a 4.5-star pick. See more NFL props here.New users can also target the FanDuel promo code, which offers new users $300 in bonus bets if their first $5 bet wins:How to make NFL player prop bets for Ravens vs. DolphinsIn addition, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model   says another star sails past his total and has three additional NFL props that are rated four stars or better.

    "body": "\n        Three rookie running backs who have been Fantasy football start/sit decisions all year made huge impacts on Sunday. RJ Harvey scored three touchdowns, Woody Marks went over 100 scrimmage yards and TreVeyon Henderson had a career-high of 75 total yards. Their Week 9 Fantasy football rankings likely received a boost, compared to the week prior, but does that warrant any of them a spot in Week 9 Fantasy football lineups ahead of more established veterans like Nick Chubb, Rhamondre Stevenson or Tony Pollard?Speaking of rookie ball carriers, Cam Skattebo is no longer an option as a Fantasy football pick after dislocating his ankle. Tyrone Tracy Jr. is seemingly the next man up in New York, but what do the Week 9 Fantasy football projections forecast for veteran Devin Singletary? Additionally, the status of Chiefs RB Isiah Pacheco (knee) is one to monitor after missing practice this week.

However, Higgins hasn't been quite as productive, as a whole, as he's been in previous years. He's averaging career lows in both yards per game (45) and receptions per game (3.1), thus making his reliance on touchdowns a risky proposition for his Fantasy owners.Higgins' touchdown reception in his last game was his lone catch of the game and now has to face a Chicago defense, whose strength is versus the pass. The Bears are allowing just 9.4 receptions per game to opposing wide receivers, which is the second-fewest in the league. Chicago hasn't allowed a single wideout to reach 100 yards since Week 2, and only one receiver has more than five catches over that span. Sitting outside the top 25 in Week 9 Fantasy football WR rankings, Higgins may not warrant a spot in Fantasy football lineups.Another curveball: The model is high on Chargers tight end Oronde Gadsden II. The fifth-round rookie has made a name for himself over the last three weeks and ranks second amongst tight ends in Fantasy points over this stretch. He had a 5-77-1 stat line last Thursday, which followed seven receptions for 164 yards and a score in his previous outing. Gadsden has started just two games this year but still has as many redzone receptions (four) as Chargers wideouts Keenan Allen, Ladd McConkey and Quentin Johnston.He now gets a dream matchup versus the Titans, who rank 29th in points allowed and 26th in yards allowed. Tennessee has given up at least 50 receiving yards or a touchdown to tight ends in each of the last three weeks. Gadsden wasn't on the Fantasy radar a few weeks ago but now finds himself among the top five in positional rankings for this week, making him a must-start for Week 9 Fantasy football lineups.

    "body": "\n        The WNBA on Wednesday offered the Women's National Basketball Players Association (WNBPA) a 30-day extension to continue negotiations on a new collective bargaining agreement, an opportunity the WNBA accepted Thursday, just hours before the current CBA was set to expire on Friday, according to The Athletic.This is not be the first time the sides needed an extension to complete negotiations on a new CBA. In fact, an extension was utilized to ratify the current CBA. In 2019, the two sides announced a 60-day extension before agreeing to a new deal in January 2020.If the league and the players cannot ultimately agree to terms on a new CBA, the next significant step could be a work stoppage -- most likely via the owners locking out the players, though the players could also go on strike. At that point, all league business would cease -- players would not even be able to access practice facilities -- but negotiations would continue.However, the two sides could first enter a status quo period, during which the conditions of the current CBA would continue, though not for a set period of time. Per the Cornell Law Review: \"Courts developed the 'status quo' doctrine from the Katz prohibition of unilateral changes. This doctrine requires employers 'to maintain, during ther period of negotiations, the status quo concerning conditions of employment in order to avoide committing [a violation of the duty to bargain in good faith].'\"\nThe key difference between status quo and an extension is that either side could announce a work stoppage at any point during status quo, while an extension would lock in the current CBA until a set date (or until a new CBA is agreed upon).The WNBA has never lost games to a work stoppage, but it has come close. In 2003, there was still no deal in place by early April when then-NBA commissioner David Stern issued an ultimatum to come to terms on a new CBA by April 18 or the season would be cancelled. The two sides did just that. As a result, the 2003 WNBA Draft was delayed, as were preseason games. WNBPA senior advisor and legal counsel Erin Drake told The Athletic on Tuesday that the two sides would not agree on a new CBA before Oct. 31. \n\"We have worked hard to be able to say on Friday, we did it. Unfortunately, that's not going to happen,\" Drake said. \"In a dance, it takes two to tango. And it has been difficult to find a beat, to find a rhythm and to find the same sense of urgency [from the league], just to be frank, to get this done.\"The league responded by stating it had made an offer to the players on Oct. 1, which had been ignored until Monday. \"We have been negotiating with the Players Association in good faith and with urgency for several months with the goal of finalizing a new collective bargaining agreement as quickly as possible,\" a WNBA spokesperson told ESPN. \"Throughout this process, we have been clear that our top priority is reaching a new collective bargaining agreement that addresses players' ask for significant increases in pay, benefits and enhancements to their experience, while ensuring the long-term growth and success of the league and its teams.\n\"We urge the Players Association to spend less time disseminating public misinformation and more time joining us in constructive engagement across the table.\"The WNBA and the WNBPA have been embroiled in a bitter labor dispute for over a year. In October 2024, the players announced their intention to opt out of the current CBA. \"This is a defining moment, not just for the WNBA, but for all of us who believe in progress,\" WNBPA president Nneka Ogwumike said in a statement at the time. \"The world has evolved since 2020, and we cannot afford to stand still. If we stay in the current agreement, we fall behind.\n\"Opting out isn't just about bigger paychecks -- it's about claiming our rightful share of the business we've built, improving working conditions, and securing a future where the success we create benefits today's players and the generations to come. We're not just asking for a CBA that reflects our value; we're demanding it, because we've earned it.\"In recent months, the tension between the players and the league, and specifically commissioner Cathy Engelbert, has heightened. Most notably, WNBPA vice president Napheesa Collier delivered a scathing rebuke of Engelbert during her exit interview following the conclusion of the Minnesota Lynx's season. \"We have the best players in the world. We have the best fans in the world. But right now we have the worst leadership in the world,\" Collier said, while also accusing Engelbert of making disparaging remarks about players, including Caitlin Clark.\nEngelbert later addressed the criticism during her pre-Finals press conference. \"I have the utmost respect for Napheesa and every single player in our league,\" she said. \"They are at the center of everything we do. I was disheartened to hear that some players feel the league and me personally do not care about them or listen to them, and if the players in the W don't feel appreciated and valued by the league, then we have to do better and I have to do better.\"The main sticking point between the two sides is the revenue sharing model. Under the current CBA, the salary cap -- and thus, player salaries -- increases at a fixed rate of 3% per year. The players are pushing for a new model where salaries grow with the business. Currently, reports indicate that players only receive about 9% of all revenue, a far cry from the 49-51% of basketball-related income that NBA players receive.\nWhile Engelbert and NBA commissioner Adam Silver have both publicly supported raising player salaries, they have pushed back on revenue sharing. \"I think share isn't the right way to look at it because there's so much more revenue in the NBA,\" Silver said earlier this month. \"I think you should look at absolute numbers in terms of what they are making. They are going to get a big increase in this cycle of collective bargaining and they deserve it.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        AFC squads coming off much-needed victories will kick off NFL Week 9 when the Miami Dolphins host the Baltimore Ravens on 'Thursday Night Football.' Baltimore (2-5) ended a four-game skid with a 30-16 win over Chicago on Sunday, while Miami (2-6) had lost three in a row before beating Atlanta, 34-10, in Week 8. Both teams currently sit in third place in their respective divisions, and the Ravens are 9-3 versus the Dolphins over their last 12 meetings. Lamar Jackson (hamstring) is expected to play after being sidelined since Week 4, as is Tua Tagovailoa (thumb) despite being on the injury report.Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Fla. Baltimore prevailed, 56-19, when the teams last met in 2023. The latest Dolphins vs. Ravens odds have Baltimore as 7.5-point road favorites, and the Ravens are 1-3 ATS with Jackson as starter, while Miami is 4-2 ATS over its last six games. The over/under for total points is 51.5, making it the third-highest of NFL Week 9. Baltimore is at -457 on the money line (risk $457 to win $100), with Miami at +350 (risk $100 to win $350).

The team played turnover-free ball, rushed for 177 yards and two touchdowns, and the defense allowed a season-low of 16 points. Baltimore kept Chicago out of the endzone through the air, marking the first time the Ravens have held an opponent without a passing touchdown in 2025, and the 96 rushing yards allowed by the Ravens were the second-fewest they've given up all year.Even with Jackson missing over half of the offensive snaps this year, Baltimore still ranks second in yards per rush (5.3). Derrick Henry moved into sole possession of fifth place on the all-time rushing touchdowns list versus Chicago, passing Bears legend Walter Payton, and he should find similar success versus Miami's defense, which allows the fourth-most yards per carry. The Dolphins passing defense is even more exploitable, as it's given up the highest completion percentage, has the fewest interceptions and has allowed the second-highest passer rating. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Dolphins can coverDespite being 2-4 straight up over their last six games, the Dolphins are 4-2 versus the spread during this span. They're coming off their best performance on both sides of the ball, scoring a season-high of 34 points and allowing a season-low of 10 points in a win over Atlanta. The team still has playmakers even without Tyreek Hill, as De'Von Achane has at least 91 scrimmage yards or a touchdown in nine straight games, while Jaylen Waddle has at least 95 receiving yards in three of his last four.Those playmakers can take advantage of a Baltimore defense which hasn't played up to the franchise's standards. The Ravens rank in the bottom five in points allowed, yards allowed, passing defense and third-down defense. Only one team has allowed more rushing scores than Baltimore, and opponents have scored in an NFL-high of 52.7% of possessions versus it. Tua Tagovailoa should have all day to pick apart Baltimore's secondary as the Ravens have the second-fewest sacks on the year. See which team to back at SportsLine. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code to get $300 in bonus bets after placing a $5 wager:How to make Ravens vs. Dolphins picksFor the NFL Week 9 'Thursday Night Football' game of Dolphins vs. Ravens, the model is leaning Over the total, projecting 61 total points.

    "description": "\n        Artificial intelligence has apparently found its way into the National Women's Soccer League. Seattle Reign head coach Laura Harvey recently ",
    "body": "\n        Artificial intelligence has apparently found its way into the National Women's Soccer League. Seattle Reign head coach Laura Harvey recently revealed that she used ChatGPT out of interest and to test its women's soccer knowledge, while also using a prompt for tactical ideas on how to compete against other teams in the NWSL. Speaking on the \"Soccerish Podcast,\" the most veteran coach in the league spoke about how she engaged with the technology over the course of the offseason, using different questions that ranged from a general standpoint to more specific formative prompts.\"One day in the offseason, I was writing things into ChatGPT like, 'What is Seattle Reign's identity?' And it would spurt it out. And I was like 'I don't know if that's true or not,'\" she said. \"And then I put in, 'What formation should you play to beat NWSL teams?' And it spurted out every team in the league and what formation you should play. And for two teams, it went 'You should play a back five.' So I did. No joke, that's why I did it.\"  \nAI in soccer 101The tactical conversation came about after Harvey was asked how she's evolved on or off the pitch as a coach, and the Reign manager mentioned she'd never coached a back five until this year. \n\"I'd never really done a lot of research on it. I'd never really, like, invested into how it could be played in the women's game. I'd only ever really seen it from afar, you know, watching men's games really,\" Harvey said on the podcast. \"It was always sort of talked about as a way to see games out. You know, [you go ahead] and get into a back five and stop people from scoring, was sort of how, like, a back five had been talked about for me.\"She went on to explain that the unorthodox method came later, while using the AI technology, after delivering questionable information about the club itself. That's Harvey then got more specific in the prompts.So what were the games she referenced?While Harvey didn't give specific details about what the AI's response gave, she did key in on the fact that a back-five formation was suggested for two specific teams. \nA quick search, first round by Kim McCauley, shows that they played with five in the back in a 1-0 loss against Orlando Pride in April. Another significant five back moment against a top squad was an early match in May against Kansas City Current, where the Reign won, 1-0.\"It was early in the season. And I said to the coaching staff, 'I'm not joking, this is what I did.' And they were like, 'Huh, interesting,'\" she recounted. \"We researched it. We did a deep dive on it. We thought about how we could play it, and we went for it, and we liked it. It worked. We won the game.\"\nLater in the season, the Reign lost to Kansas City 2-0, and the Current clinched the 2025 NWSL Shield. In fairness to Harvey, they started the game with three in the back that day.While Harvey may have used the technology out of curiosity and for general brainstorming, there's still the part of actually executing the ideas. With Harvey emphasizing that ChatGPT 'didn't tell you how to play it, what to do in it, or any of that stuff,\" but just the presentation of the idea sparked enough interest in her to bring it to her coaching staff. So what has happened since?The Reign have since used the five-back model in several of their games this season while also implementing a three-back or standard four-back formation. While it hasn't made the team the most threatening in front of goal, it has made them a frustrating side to play against, and their record was enough this year to clinch them a playoff spot. \nWhat final seeding they'll be will depend on the final regular-season match day, as they're currently in fourth place. The irony of the Reign's NWSL Decision Day match is that it is against third-place Orlando Pride, and the two teams are still in contention for the honor to host a playoff match. Whoever is the winner between the two could potentially secure third place, while the loser could end as low as a seventh seed, pending results across the league.Though no matter the playoff position, Harvey is confident in her team's ability to adjust and adapt. It's been their big strength this season despite the lack of goal scoring. \"We've obviously come in and out of it. We played it tons, then we came out of it, and then we went back into it. And now we're quite, like, fluid actually. We can float in and out of it within games. And I love that,\" said Harvey.\n\"When I hear coaches saying, 'We don't know what you're going to do, you're the hardest team to prepare for. Defend. You defend in multiple ways in games.' I'm just like [fist pumping] that, I want everyone to not have a clue what we're going to do. I think that is, like, amazing.\"What does ChatGPT say about Seattle Reign?So now that the regular season is almost over, with just one game remaining with Decision Day on Sunday, what does ChatGPT have to say about Seattle Reign's identity now? For starters, it says a whole lot, including outdated information and multiple references to its old name, OL Reign, under previous ownership, OL Groupe, and that it has attracted some of the best international players, \"such as Megan Rapinoe, Jess Fishlock, and Lydia Williams.\" Former U.S women's national team star Rapinoe retired in 2023. So, has Williams, who also left the club in 2019. It also references the Reign's playing style as \"fast and possession-based,\" which, considering the AI suggested a five-back to Harvey earlier this year, is the complete opposite of how they have played this season.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        A pair of AFC division leaders headline the NFL Week 9 schedule when the Indianapolis Colts take on the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday. The Colts, behind running back Jonathan Taylor and quarterback Daniel Jones, have taken command of the AFC South at 7-1. Pittsburgh, meanwhile, is in control of the AFC North at 4-3, but have dropped two in a row. Quarterback Aaron Rodgers is coming off a disappointing performance in a loss to the Green Bay Packers, a team he spent 18 years with. Indianapolis enters as a 3-point favorite and is one of seven road favorites during the Week 9 NFL schedule.  Another matchup involving contenders sees the Kansas City Chiefs (4-3) visiting the Buffalo Bills (5-2). The Chiefs are 1.5-point favorites as former MVP quarterbacks Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen square off for the 10th time, with Mahomes holding a 5-4 edge. However, Buffalo has won four straight regular season meetings with Kansas City. How should you handle those NFL games and optimize what to bet on NFL in Week 9?

    "body": "\n        LSU and athletic director Scott Woodward have agreed to part ways, the program announced Thursday night. This significant change atop the Tigers' organization comes as amid a football coaching search that will hire a replacement for Brian Kelly, who was ousted from the team last Sunday.Woodward had fallen out of favor with LSU stakeholders, including Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, who said Woodward would not hire the Tigers' next coach due to his track record of owing colossal buyouts to fired team leaders.Kelly existed LSU with a massive $53 million buyout, the second largest in college football history. Woodward has a $6.4 million of his own. The Tigers may not be on the hook for those total sums given both contracts include a mitigation clause with a duty to seek new employment.\"We thank Scott for the last six years of service as athletic director,\" said Scott Ballard, chairman of the LSU Board of Supervisors. \"He had a lot of success at LSU, and we wish him nothing but the best in the future. Our focus now is on moving the athletic department forward and best positioning LSU to achieve its full potential.\"\nLongtime athletic administrator Verge Ausberry will serve as the interim AD. He will be charged with leading \"all facets of the athletic department, including the search for the next football coach,\" per LSU. Ausbery served as executive deputy AD under Woodward and LSU's executive director of external relations.\"I'm honored for the board of supervisors and university leadership to put their trust in me to serve the university in this role,\" Ausberry said in a release. \"... It's my responsibility to move this athletic department forward, including hiring the best football coach in America to lead our program. Our coaches and staff will continue to work every day to give our student-athletes the best experience possible and set a championship-level standard.\"Landry previously indicated that, instead of Woodward, the LSU Board of Supervisors would oversee the search for a new football coach. It was not specified whether that is still the plan with Ausberry leading the search or Ausberry will have greater authority in the hiring process.\n\"We are not going down a failed path,\" Landry said, \"and I wanted to tell you something. This is a pattern. The guy that wrote [Kelly's] contract cost Texas A&M $70-something million. We have a $53 million liability. I believe that we are going to find a great coach. … The board of supervisors are going to come up with a committee, and they're going to find us a coach.\"Woodward was hired by LSU in 2019 after a run at Texas A&M in which he was responsible for hiring Jimbo Fisher away from Florida State. He brought Fisher in at a significant sum with an ill-timed, substantial contract extension resulting in the largest buyout in college football history, leaving the Aggies on the hook for $76 million when they fired Fisher during the 2023 season.Woodward similarly plucked Kelly away from Notre Dame, originally signing him to a 10-year, $95 million contract in 2021.\nWhile neither Kelly nor Fisher delivered on the lofty expectations at their respective schools, Woodward did make a home-run hire earlier in his career. The former Washington AD successfully pried Chris Petersen away from Boise State in a move that revitalized the Huskies football program, which ultimately made a College Football Playoff appearance in 2016.Woodward's propensity to make splashy hires injected energy into the programs at each of his stops, but those moves ultimately came with drastic financial consequences at Texas A&M and LSU.The Kelly firing spelled the end of Woodward's six-year run at LSU. Kelly was an awkward fit for the Tigers from the start but carried immense promise as a longtime winner at Notre Dame. He never lost fewer than three games in a season in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, though he failed to reach the CFP.\nStruggles to break into the SEC's most elite tier reached a head last weekend when the Tigers lost at home in blowout fashion to No. 3 Texas A&M. Chants of \"Fire Kelly\" rang throughout a deflated Tiger Stadium.\n            ",

Prior to the 49ers' trip to New York in Week 9, Saleh had some high praise for Dart and the Giants front office, and he even had a little fun with Brian Daboll's injury tent saga.During his Thursday press conference, Saleh discussed what he's seen from Dart on film, and he gushed about the rookie signal-caller. He even went so far as to sympathize with Dabolls' decision to chase Dart into the injury tent a few weeks ago, which resulted in fines for the Giants and Daboll himself.\"He is uber-talented,\" Saleh said. \"I understand why Daboll went into the blue tent. I probably would've went too. The kid is good, man. I think New York hit on this one big-time.\"Saleh added that Daboll and Giants offensive coordinator Mike Kafka do a good job highlighting Dart's strengths.\n\"He's dynamic,\" Saleh said of Dart. \"He's decisive. He's accurate. He's been a joy to watch just studying his tape over the last five starts. They're doing a really good job with him. There's certain things they're asking of him, but they're doing a good job hiding it in their weekly game plans. ... This kid, he's gonna be special.\"New York traded back into the first round of the 2025 NFL Draft to select Dart at No. 25 overall, and that gamble has paid off so far. In his first five starts, Dart has completed 59.9% of his passes for 984 yards, eight touchdowns and three interceptions. He's also showed off his mobility with 195 yards and four scores on the ground.\nGiven the state of the Giants' quarterback struggles since the Eli Manning era, hearing praise like that from one of the game's best defensive minds has to be music to the ears of New York fans. Now we'll see whether Dart can back up that praise from Saleh when the Giants and 49ers meet on Sunday afternoon.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        After missing the past two games with a foot injury, Cardinals' Kyler Murray is preparing to start Monday night's game against the Cowboys, Arizona coach Jonathan Gannon said on Thursday. Murray, 28, hasn't played since he injured his foot during Arizona's Week 5 loss to the Titans. That game was the third of three consecutive losses for the Cardinals, who started the year with consecutive wins over the Saints and Panthers. During Murray's absence, the Cardinals' offense was led by veteran Jacoby Brissett. While he put up decent numbers, Brissett lost both of his starts by four points to two of the NFL's best teams: the Indianapolis Colts and the Green Bay Packers. Murray's return should help revive the Cardinals' ground game, which hasn't recovered since losing former Pro Bowl running back James Conner to a season-ending injury in Week 3. Arizona has averaged 118.2 rushing yards with Murray this season and just 91 yards per game without him. Making Murray's return more significant is the fact that the Cowboys are one of the NFL's worst teams against the run. They are currently 29th in the league in rushing yards allowed, 25th in average yards-per-carry allowed and 23rd in touchdown runs permitted. \nThe Cardinals' quarterback change could also lead to more targets for second-year wideout Marvin Harrison Jr., who was targeted just eight games during the Cardinals' last two games after getting 32 targets during Murray's five games under center. \nWhile there are clear upsides to Murray's likely return, one significant downside are the turnovers that sometimes occur with Murray as a result of him either holding the ball too long or trying a low-percentage pass that ends up in the hands of the other team. Murray had two picks during Arizona's Week 4 loss to Seattle and a fumble during the Cardinals' Week 5 loss to the Titans. Murray aside, Monday is a huge game for two teams who are looking to stay alive in the NFC playoff picture. The Cardinals (2-5) haven't won since Week 2, while the Cowboys (3-4-1) are trying to get back to .500 following last week's blowout loss in Denver.\nAs for intangibles, Murray is 2-2 on Monday night, but he's never lost a game as a starter at AT&T Stadium. His lifetime mark of 9-0 stretches back to his high school days. His last game there -- on Oct. 19, 2020 -- was a 38-10 Cardinals' victory, which happens to be the lone blemish on Dak Prescott's \"Monday Night Football\" record of 5-1.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Toronto Blue Jays are one win away from winning the 2025 World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Blue Jays possess a 3-2 advantage in the best-of-seven series, putting them a victory away from claiming their first championship since repeating in 1992-93. The Dodgers, meanwhile, have no margin for error in their own pursuit of consecutive titles. It's to be determined if the World Series will conclude on Friday or Saturday, but this much is clear: the end is near. With that in mind, CBS Sports figured to use this time to sort out who is in the running for the World Series' Most Valuable Player honors.Truthfully, this is a tough World Series to elevate one player above all others. Only one of the games has been decided by fewer than four runs, and that was the 18-inning marathon that the Dodgers won in Game 3. Otherwise, there've been limited opportunities for narrative-stealing performances.Still, scroll with us as we sort through five realistic candidates through Game 5 to claim the hardware.1. Vladimir Guerrero Jr., 1B, Blue Jays\nGuerrero has a lot working in his favor. He's recorded at least one hit in all five games, and has notched multi-hit efforts in three of those. He's homered early in Games 4 (to give the Blue Jays a lead) and 5 (to pad their lead). Guerrero is also an easy choice from a narrative perspective, having started this year by putting pen to paper on a long-term extension rather than entering free agency this offseason. That last part won't show up in the stat sheet, but never doubt a writer's affection for easy copy -- especially as a tiebreaker in a field without a clear frontrunner. \n2. Trey Yesavage, RHP, Blue Jays\nRookies have won the World Series MVP trophy on three prior occasions: Jeremy Peña ('22), Livan Hernandez ('97), and Larry Sherry ('59). Yesavage made his case for becoming the fourth in Game 5, when he broke Don Newcombe's rookie reward for strikeouts by fanning 12 Dodgers. As impressive as that performance was, voters may hold a just-OK Game 1 start against him. Remember, Yesavage exited after surrendering two runs on four hits and three walks in four innings of work. For whatever it's worth: Yesavage has the second highest Championship Win Probability Added among Blue Jays, trailing only Eric Lauer, who worked several scoreless innings in that marathon Game 3 less.\n3. Addison Barger, RF, Blue Jays\nIf voters aren't taken by Guerrero or Yesavage, Barger has a decent candidacy to consider. He's notched multiple hits in four of the first five games of the set. That includes launching a grand slam that broke open Game 1 and either scoring or driving in a run in Games 3, 4, and 5. Barger also 1) recorded an assist in Game 3 and 2) was one of CBS Sports' postseason breakout picks. 4. Shohei Ohtani, TWP, Dodgers\nBobby Richardson (1960) is the only World Series MVP winner in history who played for the losing team. Ohtani probably won't become the second, but if he does it'll be on the strength of his incredible Game 3 performance that saw him record four extra-base hits (two home runs) and reach base a record nine times. Dodgers right-hander Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who threw a complete game in Game 2, would also enter the equation if he has another brilliant outing as part of his Game 6 start.5. Alejandro Kirk, C, Blue Jays\nKirk has the third highest CWPA among Blue Jays hitters, having plated six runs on six hits, including a pair of home runs. His narrative case would be stronger if the Blue Jays had held on to the 3-2 lead he staked out with a three-run shot during the middle of Game 3. Otherwise, his biggest offensive contributions to this series haven't arrived during pivotal situations -- at least not yet.\n2025 World Series MVP oddsOdds via FanDuel as of Oct. 30Vladimir Guerrero Jr.: -195Shohei Ohtani: +250Yoshinobu Yamamoto: +1300Alejandro Kirk: +2200Addison Barger: +2700Trey Yesavage: +6500\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Late on Tuesday night, after he had led the Milwaukee Bucks to a 121-111 victory over the New York Knicks, and brushed off more questions about trade rumors, Giannis Antetokounmpo said it was \"too early to give compliments\" about the team's new starting point guard, Ryan Rollins. Antetokounmpo then launched into a detailed explanation of Rollins' importance to the team, and the work he's put in to improve on both sides of the ball, which lasted nearly three minutes.\"He's been playing incredible,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"Defensively, he's one of the most annoying guards, probably, in the league. He's making the right reads. He's able to play with me, come off the bench, pretty much does everything. I love playing with him. He's been playing incredible with the team.\"Rollins was a second-round pick back in 2022, and has bounced around the league since then, in part due to his own off-court mistakes. (In Jan. 2024, Rollins was arrested and accused of shoplifting from Target. He later plead guilty to one count of petit larceny.) He appears to have found a home with the Bucks, however, and may be the answer to their backcourt questions.\nAfter Damian Lillard tore his Achilles in the playoffs, the team waived him and stretched his contract, which freed up the cap space to sign Myles Turner. While Turner's arrival helped shore up the Bucks' frontcourt, swapping an All-Star guard for a center left the Bucks' backcourt as thin as it has been since the team became a contender back in 2019. In the summer, general manager Jon Horst decided to take a by-committee approach and re-signed Rollins, Kevin Porter Jr. and Gary Trent Jr., signed Cole Anthony and gave AJ Green an extension. All are solid rotation players, but one of the big questions about the Bucks this season was whether any of them could take another step. The answer will not only help determine how far the team can go in the Eastern Conference, but whether Antetokounmpo sticks around beyond this season. The early signs suggest Rollins may be the one to make a leap. Porter rolled his ankle in the Bucks' season-opening win over the Washington Wizards, and hasn't played since. Rollins replaced him in the starting lineup, and it may be difficult to send him back to the bench once Porter is healthy. \nThrough four games, Rollins is averaging 15.3 points, 3.8 rebounds, 4.3 assists and three steals per game -- tied for first in the league -- on 47.6/35/100 shooting splits. Against the Knicks, he poured in a career-high 25 points to go along with four assists and four steals to help the Bucks improve to 3-1. Thus far, the Bucks are 8.2 points per 100 possessions better with Rollins on the floor than when he sits. His on-off splits with Antetokounmpo are particularly interesting.The Bucks have been awesome with Antetokounmpo and Rollins on the floor together \n                                                                    PBPStats.com\n                                                            When Antetokounmpo called Rollins one of the \"most annoying guards\" in the league, he wasn't lying. Rollins is tied for first in the league in steals per game (three) and third in deflections (5.5). He is willing and able to pick up opposing ball-handlers fullcourt, and if they aren't ready for that pressure, it's going to be a long night. Even when he isn't getting steals or deflections, his pressure disrupts what other teams are trying to do -- either by forcing them to run extra shot clock or have a secondary ball-handler bring up the ball.\nWatch this possession against the Knicks. He picks Brunson up 90 feet from the basket, makes him turn his back and give the ball up, presses Brunson when he gets the ball back, creates a deflection with high hands, stays attached to Brunson as he takes a tough pull-up, then jumps into the passing lane for a steal as the Knicks tried to save the offensive rebound. \nPerhaps it's no surprise that Rajon Rondo, who is working as a coaching associate with the Bucks on a part-time basis, has become a mentor for Rollins. \"Once I fouled out [in the preseason game] I knew my capabilities defensively,\" Rollins said Tuesday. \"I knew that I could stay in front of these guys and make it tough for them. So I'm not surprised at what I can do, it's just learning and being better at it.\"Here's 90 seconds of Rollins being annoying on defense:\nRollins can guard, and the Bucks want him to focus his efforts on that side of the ball. \"If I had my druthers, I'd want him to keep his defensive intensity, that's more important than anything,\" Bucks coach Doc Rivers said. But as long as Porter remains out -- and perhaps even beyond that point, depending on how the rest of the backcourt is performing -- the Bucks will need Rollins to contribute on both ends. \nRollins' pick-and-roll playmaking has been solid, but not spectacular. On his 53 pick-and-roll possessions, including shots and passes, the Bucks are scoring 1.132 points per possession, which ranks in the 76th percentile in the league, per Synergy Sports. He's shooting 35% from 3-point range, but was 3 of 16 in his first three games before going 4 of 4 against the Knicks. Rollins' 3-point shooting will be a key stat to watch. He shot 40.8% last season on 2.1 attempts per game, but did not have a meaningful amount of attempts in the NBA before that. In his two years at Toledo in college, he shot 88 of 278 from behind the arc (31.7%). Playing alongside Antetokounmpo, there will be 3-point opportunities for Rollins. Antetokounmpo was only half-joking when he said it was \"too early to give compliments\" to Rollins. Consistency is major separator in the NBA. Can Rollins keep up this level of play over the course of a full season? If he can, the Bucks will be better than everyone expected prior to the season. \n\"I know my capabilities. I've been saying that for a while now. I just needed the opportunity and the platform to be able to go out there and play through mistakes and play my game,\" Rollins said. \"I feel like I'm doing that now. [But there's] a lot more to do, so [I have to] keep growing.\"\n            ",

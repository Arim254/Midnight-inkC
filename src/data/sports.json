And if I get the urge to come back, if I feel that I can stand on the mound and come back, then I will go for that, but I'll just leave it there for now.\"Darvish underwent surgery to repair a torn UCL and flexor tendon in his elbow this past October. The timeline given for a return to the mound is 12-15 months, which theoretically would have him ready for the 2027 season. But three sources told the Union-Tribune that Darvish is pondering retirement. The 39-year-old went 5-5 with a 5.38 ERA and 68 strikeouts in 72 innings last season. He hasn't been able to make 30 starts in a season since 2022 and, really, he's dealt with injuries most of his career. He's also finished second in Cy Young voting twice and still has great stuff when he's healthy. \nDarvish is set to make $16 million in 2026 before $15 million in each 2027 and 2028. If there's a silver lining to any of this, it would be that should Darvish decide to retire, it would clear up some payroll for the Padres' front office. When players retire, they forfeit whatever is left on their deal.In parts of 13 seasons stateside, Darvish has gone 115-93 with a 3.65 ERA (116 ERA+) and 2,075 career strikeouts in 1,778 innings. He's a five-time All-Star.\nWithout Darvish, the Padres' rotation for 2026 looks like Nick Pivetta, Joe Musgrove, Randy Vásquez, J.P. Sears and Kyle Hart. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The NBA Cup has now been narrowed down to two teams, with the New York Knicks and San Antonio Spurs set to meet in the championship game on Tuesday night in Las Vegas. The Knicks beat the Orlando Magic in the semifinals to reach the title game, while the Spurs ended the Oklahoma City Thunder's 16-game win streak to advance.Victor Wembanyama made an emphatic return after missing almost a month with a calf sprain, putting up 22 points, nine rebounds, two blocks and two assists in the win. He came off the bench for the Spurs, as they're working him back in cautiously coming back from an injury. Though he only played 20 minutes, he was incredibly efficient, shooting 54% from the floor.Wembanyama and the Spurs will now take on a Knicks team that has gone 9-1 in their last 10 games. The two teams will face off in Las Vegas for the championship game, and in addition to having the title of 2025 NBA Cup winner attached to their names, there's also a large sum of prize money on the line.The winning team of the title game will take home $530,933 per player. That's a modest increase from the $500,000 per player during the inaugural event in 2023. While $530K is a drop in the bucket for players like Jalen Brunson, who is making over $34 million this season, or Karl-Anthony Towns whose contract is up to $54 million this season alone, for guys lower on the totem pole, that's a significant sum.For second-year player Ariel Hukporti, who was a second-round draft pick in 2024, he'll get about a third of what his yearly salary is ($1,955,377) if the Knicks win. It's even more lucrative for two-way players. While two-way players only get half of what those on standard contracts do, Kyle Mangas, David Jones-Garcia, Harrison Ingram, Kevin McCullar Jr., Trey Jemison and Tosan Evbuomwan will all earn roughly $265,466 if their team wins. That's almost half of the standard two-way contract of $636,435.\nEven for the losing team there's plenty of money to be made. The team that loses on Tuesday will earn $212,373 per player. That's still a ton of money for the guys on smaller contracts. Even for the bigger players, it's extra money that they otherwise would not have made, and we've heard guys in the past be motivated by the prospect of earning extra dough.After the Magic advanced to the semifinals, which earned each player $106,187, Desmond Bane noted that he was appreciative of the extra cash after just being fined $35,000 by the league for unsportsmanlike conduct.\"That's huge, man. I just lost $35,000. I gotta go get it back somehow,\" Bane said after the win. \"But I'm excited. Great opportunity for us to play some meaningful basketball early in the season.\"\nAside from the monetary motivation, though, we've seen the league's attempt to bring excitement to the early part of the NBA calendar work. The Spurs-Thunder semifinals matchup felt like a playoff game, and we should be in store for another high-intensity matchup between the Knicks and Spurs Tuesday night. Tip off is scheduled for 8:30 p.m. ET on Prime.\n            ",

    "body": "\nIf history is any indication, then the Pittsburgh Steelers are a lock to beat the Miami Dolphins in the Monday Night Football game at Acrisure Stadium in Pittsburgh.The Steelers have won 22 straight home games on Monday night, the longest such streak in NFL history. They have not lost a Monday night home game since 1991.In addition, the Dolphins have lost 13 straight games with game-time temperatures under 40 degrees. And, barring an unexpected heat wave suddenly descending upon Pittsburgh (the forecasted game-time temperature is 20 degrees), then Miami will have to overcome the cold as well as the Steelers. Against that backdrop, Monday's matchup serves as a key game in the AFC playoff race. Pittsburgh (7-6) is back atop the AFC North after knocking off the Ravens last week in Baltimore. Meanwhile, after starting the season 2-7, the Dolphins (6-7) have won four in a row to give their fans a glimmer of postseason hope, but Miami needs a win on Monday night to keep its playoff dreams alive. The Steelers are 3-point favorites over the Dolphins on Monday night.While Miami vs. Pittsburgh is the marquee attraction on Monday, there are other options on a sporting landscape that also includes a five-game NBA slate and a five-game NHL schedule. Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Monday, Dec. 15. All times Eastern.NFL best bets, where to watchDolphins at SteelersTime: 8:15 p.m. | Location: Pittsburgh | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Dolphins +146 | Expert: Dolphins +3.5 (Daniel Vithlani)\nWhat have the Dolphins done well over their four-game winning streak? The team has allowed 17 points or fewer in each of those games. In addition, Miami has found a running game. The Dolphins have rushed for 164 yards or more in each of the last four games, even with running back De'Von Achane leaving early last week. He is expected to play on Monday. The Dolphins have a plus matchup against a Pittsburgh defense that has surrendered 466 rushing yards combined over the last two weeks. \"Pittsburgh will probably be a popular pick coming off their upset win over the Ravens, but this feels like a letdown spot,\" Vithlani says. The SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, says Miami has a 42% chance to win and assigns a \"C\" grade to Dolphins money line (+146).More NFL best betsBest sportsbook promos for Dolphins-SteelersModel's anytime touchdown scorer props for Monday nightModel's Tua Tagovailoa, Aaron Rodgers player propsModel's Jaylen Waddle, DK Metcalf player propsSportsLine AI's same-game parlay picksWill Brinson's top Monday Night Football playsNBA best bets, where to watchPistons at CelticsTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Boston | TV: Peacock | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Celtics -130\nTwo of the top three teams in the Eastern Conference standings collide when the Detroit Pistons and Boston Celtics square off at TD Garden. The Pistons (20-5) own the best record in the East and have won three in a row and five of their last six and are coming off a 142-115 victory over the Hawks in which 12 Pistons scored at least seven points. Meanwhile, the Celtics (15-10) sit in third place in the East, five games behind Detroit. Boston enters off a 116-101 loss to the Bucks, which ended a five-game winning streak. Over their last nine games, the Celtics are scoring 128.5 points per 100 possessions, which ranks second in the league over that time, behind only the Nuggets. The SportsLine Projection Model says Boston has a 70% chance to win and gives a strong \"A\" grade to Celtics money line (-130).Rockets at NuggetsTime: 9:30 p.m. | Location: Denver | TV: Peacock | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Rockets -104\nTwo challengers to the Thunder's reign atop the league will battle when the Denver Nuggets host the Houston Rockets in a scintillating matchup at Ball Arena. Nikola Jokic and the Nuggets (18-6) are in second place in the Western Conference, one game ahead of Kevin Durant and the Rockets (16-6). Denver has the No. 1 offense in the NBA (124.4 points per 100 possessions), while Houston has the No. 2 defense (111.0). In the teams' only previous matchup this season, the Nuggets beat the Rockets 112-109 in Houston. But strangely, Denver has lost four straight games at home. The SportsLine Projection Model says the Rockets have a 62% chance to win and assigns a strong \"A\" grade to Houston money line (-104).NHL best bets, where to watchPanthers at LightningTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Tampa Bay, Fla. | TV: NHL Net | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Panthers +105\nThe Tampa Bay Lighting and Florida Panthers renew one of the best rivalries in the NHL when the teams face off in the latest Battle of Florida at Benchmark International Arena. Either the Panthers or Lightning has represented the Eastern Conference in the Stanley Cup Final in each of the past six seasons. This year, Tampa Bay ranks fourth in the East with 39 points while Florida is 12th with 34. Lightning goaltender Andrei Vasilevskiy, who has missed the last six games because of injury, participated in Monday's game-day skate but still isn't ready to play. The SportsLine Projection Model says Florida has a 53% chance to win and gives a \"B\" grade to Panthers money line (+105).Looking aheadNBA: Spurs vs. KnicksTime: 8:30 p.m. Tuesday | Location: Las Vegas | TV: Prime Video | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Over 227.5\nOne team will be crowned 2025 NBA Cup champions when the New York Knicks and San Antonio Spurs meet up in the final on Tuesday at T-Mobile Arena.

Victor Wembanyama returned from a monthlong absence in the win over Oklahoma City, scoring 22 points and grabbing nine rebounds in 21 minutes. Meanwhile, the Knicks advanced to the final with a 132-120 semifinal victory over the Magic. New York owns the No. 2 offense in the league (122.0 points per 100 possessions). The SportsLine Projection Model says there's a 63.8% chance the teams combine for 228 points or more and assigns a \"B\" grade to Over 227.5.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Week 15 in the NFL was certainly a consequential week. The Buffalo Bills made up ground in the AFC East by defeating the New England Patriots, while the Kansas City Chiefs and Cincinnati Bengals were eliminated from playoff contention. It was also an unfortunate week for injuries, as Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and Green Bay Packers pass rusher Micah Parsons suffered torn ACLs.The playoff picture is becoming clearer. The Los Angeles Rams look to be the team to beat in the NFL, Trevor Lawrence and the Jacksonville Jaguars may be hitting their stride at the right time and Tampa Bay Buccaneers fans breathed a huge sigh of relief when their NFC South rivals, the Carolina Panthers, were upset by the New Orleans Saints on Sunday. There is still plenty of football left to be played, but which teams are the favorites to win it all in what has been a wonky season? Below, we will break down the latest Super Bowl LX odds, courtesy of DraftKings Sportsbook.Super Bowl LX oddsTeamOddsLos Angeles Rams+310Seattle Seahawks+650Denver Broncos+800Buffalo Bills+800Philadelphia Eagles+1100Houston Texans+1100Green Bay Packers+1500New England Patriots+1500Jacksonville Jaguars+1700San Francisco 49ers+2200Los Angeles Chargers+2200Baltimore Ravens+2200Chicago Bears+3000Detroit Lions+3000Tampa Bay Buccaneers+5000Pittsburgh Steelers+7000Carolina Panthers+30000Indianapolis Colts+40000Dallas Cowboys+60000\n        \n            \n                2025 NFL playoff picture, standings: Steelers remain atop AFC North by eliminating Dolphins on 'MNF'\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nNFC West: The division to beat?The Rams should top everyone's power rankings entering Week 16, as they defeated the Lions on Sunday, 41-34. Matthew Stafford and company have put up back-to-back games with 500 total yards and 40 points and have officially clinched a playoff spot. Speaking of Stafford, this man is a monster. He leads the NFL in passing touchdowns (37) and passer rating (112.2). However, it is worth noting that Davante Adams, who leads the NFL with 14 touchdown receptions, left the Lions game with a hamstring injury.It's fairly fascinating that the Seahawks currently have the second-shortest odds to win the Super Bowl. Yes, they have won four straight games, but needed a game-winning field goal to beat a 44-year-old grandfather on Sunday. The issues -- or maybe let's call them inconsistencies -- run deeper.In its eventual 37-9 win over the Atlanta Falcons, Seattle was tied at the halftime break, 6-6. In the 26-0 victory over the Minnesota Vikings in Week 13, the Seahawks offense recorded just 219 total yards. Seattle played the lowly Tennessee Titans close in Week 12, and then of course lost to the Rams in Week 11. Seattle has a chance to change the narrative Thursday against the rival Rams, but it's fair to have questions about this team as legitimate contenders. The Buckin' BroncosHow about this Broncos squad? They are now the No. 1 seed in the AFC with a 12-2 record following the 34-26 win over the Packers, and have officially clinched a playoff spot. Those 12 wins are the most victories Denver has earned since 2015, when it won Super Bowl 50.Bo Nix has caught plenty of flak for his ups and downs this season, but he balled out Sunday with 302 passing yards and four touchdowns. We already know how good this Broncos defense is, as they rank top five in both total defense (287.7 yards allowed per game) and scoring defense (18.6 points allowed per game). With the Chiefs out of the running, are the Broncos the legitimate favorite in the AFC? Vegas believes it's them, or Josh Allen and the Bills. What about the NFC North?Sportsbooks do not trust the NFC North, as Vegas believes a whopping 12 NFL teams have a better chance to win the Super Bowl than the current No. 2-seeded Bears. That includes the No. 7 seed Packers. Chicago has a tough stretch to end the season, as the Bears host the Packers Saturday night, play at the 49ers in Week 17 and then finish the season at home against the desperate Lions. The Bears have recorded double-digit wins for the first time since 2018 and boast the most opportunistic defense in the NFL, which leads the league with 30 takeaways. However, Chicago missed an opportunity to beat the Packers last week. As we mentioned, the Bears get a chance at revenge at home Saturday night. Don't rule out the Lions, sitting at the No. 8 seed with an 8-6 record. They close out the season with the Steelers, Vikings and Bears.SportsLine projections for the NFC NorthTeamChances to win divisionChances to make playoffsBears46.0%80.8%Packers47.7%89.0%Lions6.3%34.6%\n            ",

The Steelers had lost three of their previous four games and five of their previous seven after starting the season with a 4-1 record, so it was massive for them to get back in the win column ahead of the stretch run.Miami has won four in a row since losing to Baltimore back in Week 9, and is now on the fringes of the playoff race in a season that started off in disastrous fashion. The Dolphins have been running the ball like crazy during their winning streak, while also turning over the opposing team multiple times in each of those games. Will the Steelers make it two in a row, or will the Dolphins pull off the upset to stay alive in the AFC playoff race? We'll find out soon enough. But before we detail some key storylines, here's a look at how you can watch the game.\nWhere to watch Steelers vs. DolphinsDate: Monday, Dec. 15 | Time: 8:15 p.m. ETLocation: Acrisure Stadium (Pittsburgh)TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free) Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Steelers -3, O/U 42.5 via DraftKings SportsbookLIVE updates: Follow along with all the action as the Steelers battle the Dolphins on \"Monday Night Football.\"Key storylinesAFC North race. Pittsburgh currently holds a half-game lead in the division over the Ravens. The Steelers will maintain their AFC North lead no matter the result of this game by virtue of having defeated Baltimore last week, but it would obviously be beneficial to hold onto the one-game cushion heading into the stretch run. After this game against Miami, the Steelers close out the season with games in Detroit, in Cleveland and then at home against the Ravens. Baltimore closes by hosting New England and then traveling to Green Bay and Pittsburgh.AFC wild card race. The Dolphins are 2.5 games back of the Texans for the No. 7 seed in the AFC and technically still alive in the wild card chase. They're going to need to win out and they'll need to get a whole lot of help from other teams along the way. Following this game against the Steelers, they close the season by hosting the Bengals and Buccaneers and then traveling to New England to take on the Patriots. The Steelers are obviously still alive for a wild card spot as well with their 7-6 record, but they're far more likely to make it by holding off the Ravens in the division race than by sneaking in as a wild card, which by contrast is Miami's only path to the postseason.Revenge games for star DBs. Minkah Fitzpatrick and Jalen Ramsey will each be playing against their former teams in these games after they were involved in a trade for each other this offseason. Fitzpatrick spent five-plus seasons in Pittsburgh after being traded there (by Miami) early in the second year of his NFL career, only to be sent back to the Dolphins this past offseason. Ramsey played two years in Miami before being traded to Pittsburgh. Steelers vs. Dolphins pick, prediction\nDid you know that the Dolphins are 5-1 in their last six games since dropping to 1-6 and looking like their season was done? Mike McDaniel has this team playing really well! They can run on anybody, and we've seen that you can run on the Steelers. (Look at what the Bills did a couple weeks ago.) If they can control the game on the ground, I like their chances to pull off an upset here, considering that the Pittsburgh offense still isn't explosive enough to put an opponent away. \nPick: Miami 21, Pittsburgh 17 | Dolphins +3, Under 42.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Alabama coach Kalen DeBoer reiterated a previous point Monday that he stands committed to the Crimson Tide, stiff-arming speculation concerning the Michigan vacancy ahead of a College Football Playoff bout with Oklahoma. Deboer, widely-considered among the best fits for the Wolverines soon after Sherrone Moore's firing further commented on job speculation Monday morning.\"I put a statement out yesterday because I just … first of all, our guys handle distractions phenomenally,\" DeBoer said. \"It's been that way all season long. They continue to do that. But I also knew yesterday and today was pretty important. I wasn't going to see (media) until today to address it, so that's why I put that out there. Lot of the same things I said before a couple weeks ago when I was asked the same question. \"Just feel complete supported. My family loves living here. All the things we continue to build on. Love the progress. Haven't talked with anyone. No plans of talking with anyone. I think that's a lot of what I said a couple weeks ago and it continues to be the same thing. Our guys, if there's been any distraction, I haven't seen it. Haven't felt it. We've probably all-season long have dealt with enough noise where it doesn't surprise me on how they've handled this.\"In his second season with the Crimson Tide after taking Washington to the 2023 national championship game, DeBoer is 19-7 at Alabama, which faces Oklahoma in the first round of the College Football Playoff on Friday night.\n\"We are proud to have Coach DeBoer leading our football program at The University of Alabama,\" Crimson Tide athletic director Greg Byrne said in Sunday's previous statement. \"He is an incredible coach and does an excellent job with the development of our student-athletes, both on and off the field. Just as he is committed to this team, we are committed to him, and we look forward to taking the field Friday in the first round of the College Football Playoff.\"DeBoer's statement came after Ryan Williams and other players mentioned rumors on social media being difficult to avoid.\"Yeah, of course we see it on TV, but I mean, he's gave his best effort here,\" Williams said Friday. \"Focused on playing against Oklahoma, we're not really worried about it. ... I mean, at the end of the day, he serves us 100% and that's our coach, so we're going to play for him. External noise is external noise, so we just focus on the internal.\"\nThis isn't the first job opening this cycle where DeBoer's name immediately emerged. DeBoer denied previous speculation about the Penn State vacancy prior to the Nittany Lions' hiring of Matt Campbell, but had not addressed the Michigan situation until Sunday.DeBoer and the Crimson Tide's chief focus can now be on the Sooners after a previous loss to Oklahoma last month put Alabama in several playoff elimination games down the stretch. The Crimson Tide suffered three giveaways during that 23-21 setback in Tuscaloosa despite doubling Oklahoma in total yardage and largely dominating the contest.The Alabama-Oklahoma winner plays unbeaten and top-seeded Indiana at the Rose Bowl in the quarterfinals.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Philip Rivers came out of retirement to help the Indianapolis Colts reach the postseason, and he held his own in the 18-16 loss to the Seattle Seahawks. While CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz reported that Anthony Richardson is medically cleared to return to the field, the Colts will not make a change at quarterback.Coach Shane Steichen told reporters that Rivers will start again on Monday night, when the Colts host Brock Purdy and the San Francisco 49ers in prime time. The 44-year-old grandfather gets another shot under center. Rivers completed 18 of 27 passes for 120 yards Sunday with one touchdown and one interception. It marked Rivers' fewest passing yards since 2009, but it had been 1,800 days since he last played in an NFL game. All things considered, it was not a bad outing. \"Very encouraged, there's no question about it,\" Steichen said of Rivers' play after the game, via the Colts' official website. \"For him to go out there and do what he did after five years off, to have a chance to win it, get a game-winning field goal -- close to it -- with 40 seconds left in a hostile environment against a top defense. Just shows his commitment to coming back and playing the way he did and fighting like crazy for his teammates. I thought that was pretty awesome.\"Rivers came in, not to push the ball down the field and create explosive plays, but to run the offense and be consistent from the pocket. He did just that on Sunday. Rivers didn't have too many misfires, and more importantly did not make any horrific errors. \n\"This isn't the motivation, but I do think that maybe there will be -- I think about my own boys, my own two sons, but certainly the high school team I'm coaching, but this isn't why I'm doing it,\" Rivers said in his postgame press conference. \"I know it comes with it and I know it is a story and I know it is rare and all those things, but I didn't do that. I was enjoying myself down there being coach in south Alabama.\"Obviously this doesn't come up every day. But I think maybe it will inspire or teach not to be run or be scared of what may or may not happen. Hopefully, certainly I think of my sons and those ballplayers that I'm in charge of at the school, that they'll say crap, coach wasn't scared. Like, shoot, sometimes there is doubt and it's real, and again, the guaranteed safe bet is to go home or to not go for it, and the other one is shoot, we'll see what happens. And so yeah, I hope in that sense it can be a positive to some young boys or young people, doesn't have to be boys. But again, that's not the motivation. But whatever God's will, I'm happy with.\"It will be interesting to see how Rivers looks with another week of preparation. The Colts' running backs predictably were a major part of the offensive game plan, as Jonathan Taylor rushed 25 times for 87 yards, while Ameer Abdullah led the Colts with five catches for 32 yards. \nThe 10-4 49ers represent another tough test for Indy as winners of four straight games, and in the hunt for the No. 1 seed. As for the Colts, they have a 13.8% chance to rebound and make the playoffs, according to SportsLine's projections. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Winter Meetings are well in the rearview mirror by now and plenty of things still need to happen in the MLB offseason. Let's gather the comings and goings of the day right here. Dodgers told Glasnow he won't be tradedA rumor coming out of the Winter Meetings was that the Dodgers were dangling starting pitcher Tyler Glasnow in trade talks. There are still two years and $65 million left on Glasnow's deal before a $30 million club option in 2028, and while he's been good while healthy, he has never pitched more than 135 innings in a single season (his career high came in 2024 with the Dodgers, his first season after being traded to Los Angeles).Glasnow, though, said on MLB Network Radio that the Dodgers' front office told him he won't be traded. He said he trusts them.Obviously plans can change, but it doesn't seem like the Dodgers front office would go out of their way to tell Glasnow he's not going anywhere if they were planning to trade him. \nMets looking for frontline starting pitching, also a batThe Mets \"still want to add a starter for somewhere in the front half of their rotation,\" according to The Athletic, and are also \"eyeing another bat.\" The report says it would be surprising if the Mets didn't add to their outfield, particularly after Brandon Nimmo was traded away. Further, they are open to trading Ronny Mauricio, Luisangel Acuña and/or Mark Vientos. The rotation right now has Nolan McLean, David Peterson, Kodai Senga, Clay Holmes and Sean Manaea with depth options Jonah Tong and Brandon Sproat. Perhaps McLean grows into an ace while Peterson and Senga have shown the ability to pitch like All-Stars at times, but there isn't a true ace here right now. Hence the Mets interest in grabbing a frontline guy from outside the organization.In terms of adding to the outfield, right field is locked up with Juan Soto and Jeff McNeil is penciled into left, but he can move around. Mets president of baseball operations David Stearns said earlier this winter that top prospect Carson Benge will get a chance to win the starting center field job out of spring training, but he has yet to even make his major-league debut. They've been connected in trade rumors with Luis Robert Jr. since at least the 2025 trade deadline.\nBraves sign KimThe Braves and free-agent shortstop Ha-Seong Kim have reached an  agreement on a one-year, $20 million contract, per The Athletic. He figures to start most days. Kim, 30, finished last season with the Braves after being claimed off waivers from the Rays. He hit for an 83 OPS+ overall in 48 games, having missed most of the year recovering from shoulder surgery.Kim nonetheless opted out of his original contract, which would've paid him $16 million in 2026. Clearly that was a wise decision.\nPhillies sign GarcíaThe Phillies have agreed to a one-year, $10 million deal with outfielder Adolis García, per The Athletic. The 32 year old has had quite a fall in the last two years. In 2023, he was an All-Star and Gold Glover and one of the best players on the World Series champion Rangers, slashing .245/.328/.508 (127 OPS+) with 39 homers, 107 RBI and 4.5 WAR. He was non-tendered by the Rangers this offseason after hitting .227/.271/.394. The Phillies will be hoping that this lottery ticket cashes with García bouncing back and looking like the 2023 version of himself.Also, the Phillies have been rumored to be looking to trade right fielder Nick Castellanos and this move sure seems like it's coverage for such a reality. García hits perfectly in that spot.\nRoyals eyeing DuranThe Royals needed basically an entire outfield as they headed into the offseason. They have traded for Isaac Collins and signed free agent Lane Thomas, but it still certainly isn't a strength. They are reportedly open to trading for another outfielder and have their eyes on Red Sox All-Star outfielder Jarren Duran, per The Athletic. Duran, 29, hit .256/.332/.442 (114 OPS+) with 41 doubles, 13 triples, 16 home runs, 84 RBI, 86 runs, 24 steals and 4.7 WAR last season.Interestingly, the report notes that a Duran move could cost the Royals left-handed starter Cole Ragans. After an All-Star season in 2024, injuries ruined the 2025 season for Ragans, but he still has the upside of an ace. \nFurther, the Royals also have interest in Cardinals utility man Brendan Donovan. Ketel Marte's no-trade listDiamondbacks All-Star second baseman Ketel Marte's name remains in the trade rumor mill. He's still got $102.5 million over the next six years on his contract, but he's good enough to make that a bargain. There have reportedly been clubhouse issues, of course, which makes things a bit more murky.Further complicating matters might be his no-trade clause. There are five teams on it, according to The Athletic: the Athletics, Pirates, Yankees, Giants and Cardinals.\nBell signs with TwinsThe Twins have agreed to a one-year deal with first baseman Josh Bell, reports ESPN. The deal is for a guaranteed $7 million, per the Minnesota Star-Tribune.Bell, a 33-year-old switch-hitter, slashed .237/.325/.417 (110 OPS+) with 22 home runs, 63 RBI and 0.4 WAR in 140 games for the Nationals last season. The Twins appear to be headed toward a bit of a rebuild, but reports have also indicated they are hanging on to outfielder Byron Buxton along with starting pitchers Pablo López and Joe Ryan. Much like with Glasnow and the Dodgers, though, things can change quickly.\nMets sign PacheThe Mets and outfielder Christian Pache have agreed to a deal, according to the New York Post. This is a depth signing. Pache didn't play in the majors in 2025 after posting -0.2 WAR with three different teams in 2024. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Davante Adams left Sunday's 41-34 win over the Detroit Lions with a non contact hamstring injury and did not return. The injury represents a potentially critical setback for Matthew Stafford's second-leading target in the passing game.Adams, who had been playing through a mild hamstring issue, appeared to worsen the injury on a deep route with 12:42 remaining in the game. Adams pulled up near the end of his route and crashed to the ground, lying on his stomach helmet down knowing the injury was significant.On Monday evening, NFL insider Ian Rapoport provided a somewhat positive update, stating that Adams was considered week-to-week. That likely means Adams will miss the Rams' Week 16 game with the Seattle Seahawks on Thursday night, but Adams could be available for the regular season stretch run, as well as the playoffs for the NFC leaders.\nAdams, who walked off the field on his own power, registered 71 yards on four receptions before the injury and leads the NFL with 14 receiving touchdowns this season. The veteran pass-catcher entered the Rams' Week 15 victory with 56 catches and 718 yards, second on the team in both categories behind Puka Nacua.\n\"He was optimistic. He knows his body really well,\" Rams coach Sean McVay said of Adams. \"We'll see what that means. I can't imagine that's good for Thursday with just the short amount of time, but I certainly wouldn't rule him out quite yet. But it didn't look good.\"  Adams was questionable to return following the hamstring pull, but did not make it back into the game. Adams' availability to play for the Rams (11-3) in Thursday night's matchup with the Seattle Seahawks is unknown.\"That'll be a tough one,\" Stafford said. \"I don't know the extent of it. Didn't look like it was a good one, so I feel so tough for him. He's been a warrior for us all year, really, to be honest with you. Playing out there for us. So we'll see. I got a lot of faith and trust in the other guys that we have in our locker room and our coaching staff to put us in a great position to go out there, let our play do the talking and just go play.\"\nLeading the NFC West, the Rams are the top playoff seed.

Yet that's exactly what happened to the Green Bay Packers on Sunday.Two plays.Season flipped.The Packers led the Denver Broncos 23-14 in the third quarter when Jordan Love took a deep shot to wide receiver Christian Watson. The pass was intercepted by Patrick Surtain II, instantly changing the feel of the game. Watson also suffered an injury on the play and didn't return.Two series later, with Green Bay clinging to a 23-21 lead, the Packers lost pass rusher Micah Parsons for the season with a torn ACL. The team was visibly deflated after that, and Denver went on to win the game.In the span of less than an hour, the Packers went from looking like a potential top seed in the NFC to a team hanging on for dear life in the playoff race. Green Bay now sits seventh heading into a crucial road matchup against the Chicago Bears, who lead the NFC North.\nWatson is the speed that makes the offense go. Parsons is the player who makes the defense go. Without them, what now?And it wasn't just those two losses. The Packers are also without tight end Tucker Kraft, who was having a career year, along with a slew of other key contributors. Against Denver, they lost right tackle Zach Tom -- their best offensive lineman -- and safety Evan Williams, arguably their best player on the back end this season.How do they overcome all of that? I'm not sure they can.The Packers drop to No. 10 in my power rankings this week after the loss to the Broncos. I picked Green Bay to reach the Super Bowl before the Parsons injury, but these injuries will be tough to overcome.\nIs it impossible? Not if Jordan Love plays out of his mind and players like Rashan Gary and Lukas Van Ness emerge as dominant edge rushers. But it certainly won't be easy.The NFL being a survival test was on full display Sunday in Denver. The Packers' season changed in a big way in less than an hour.It was just two plays -- but those two plays could be so meaningful down the stretch in the NFC.\n\n        Biggest Movers\n    \n                4\n            \n                Vikings\n            \n                5\n            \n                Packers\n            RkTeams\n                    ChgRcrd\n                                1\n                            \n                                    Broncos\n                                \n                            They take over the top spot after beating the Packers.

    "body": "\n        In a flurry of movement Monday morning, five different high-level quarterbacks announced their intention to go in the college football transfer portal. Former five-stars Dylan Raiola and DJ Lagway left Nebraska and Florida, respectively, after two seasons. Aidan Chiles, a former top 60 recruit, opted to depart Michigan State. East Carolina QB Katin Houser decided to make a run back to the Power Four following a breakout season. All the while, the portal has new No. 1 player according to Cooper Petagna's big board at 247Sports: Cincinnati's Brendan Sorsby, who hopped back into the portal ahead of his final season of college football. It was all a bit dizzying. The portal doesn't open for another three weeks, and there are still many high-profile moves expected to occur both within in the quarterback market and apart from it. With that in mind, let's reset the quarterback landscape, highlighting some of the big names, schools to watch and names we still have on the radar ahead of Jan. 2.\nThe names atop the QB market No. 1 Brendan Sorsby, Cincinnati: Sorsby finished the year ranked 10th in ESPN's QBR metric, emerging as one of the truly elite passers in the sport. The two early schools to watch with Sorsby are Indiana and Texas Tech. The Hoosiers are a bit ironic given that's where Sorsby started his career, exiting Bloomington shortly after Curt Cignetti arrived. The Red Raiders are the local school to have on the radar -- if you consider 300 miles of West Texas driving local -- and seem to be a strong on-paper fit for the junior passer. Of note with Sorsby: Sources have indicated he still plans to consider the NFL Draft. But those are two schools to know if he does opt to stay in school. No. 2 Dylan Raiola, Nebraska: It probably is unsurprising to see Raiola's name listed here given the lead up the last few weeks. His brother decommitted from Nebraska. The school fired his uncle Donovan, the offensive line coach. CBS Sports reported the split was likely. But the end of the Raiola and Nebraska partnership is still interesting given how much the two sides had invested in each other, including a $3.5 million rev share/NIL package for Raiola. As for what's next, an early school to keep an eye on is Oregon. The Raiola camp has interest in the Ducks, per sources, and there is a growing industry thought that Oregon QB Dante Moore will end up testing the NFL Draft waters.No. 3 DJ Lagway, Florida: Unlike the above two situations that had been trending toward a breakup for weeks, the divorce between Lagway and Florida came as somewhat of a surprise Monday. Lagway only decided in recent days he'd move on after his initial meetings with the new Florida staff went poorly, per sources. As for what's next for the former No. 1 QB prospect in the 2024 class, schools like Baylor, Florida State and Duke (depending on what happens with Darian Mensah) have been brought up per sources along with those like Clemson, LSU and Miami. Of note, Lagway's dad played at Baylor.\n\n        \n            \n                Where will DJ Lagway transfer? Departing Florida QB's possible destinations include LSU, Miami, Clemson\n                \n                    Cody Nagel                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nOthers we're watchingSam Leavitt, QB, Arizona State: Industry sources have pointed at Leavitt for months as someone who could enter the transfer portal. That seems like a formality at this point after he didn't attend Arizona State's year-end banquet and head coach Kenny Dillingham wished him well \"in whatever his future may hold,\" per 247Sports' Chris Karpman. CJ Bailey, QB, NC State: A star sophomore with the Wolfpack, Bailey is a popular rumor for other teams in terms of potential portal candidates. Dave Doeren coming back aids NC State's chances of keeping Bailey around, but he remains a very hot name in terms of other programs looking at the quarterback market. Byrum Brown, QB, South Florida: It raised some eyebrows in the industry when Brown opted out of the Cure Bowl. Brown is a senior, but he's pursing a waiver that is expected to go through. If it does … several schools in the industry are watching Brown and his status. There would be a natural fit at Auburn, where his former South Florida head coach Alex Golseh resides. \nDrew Mestemaker, QB, North Texas: A breakout star as a redshirt freshman this season, Mestemaker led the FBS with 4,129 passing yards to go along with 31 touchdowns on 70.2% passing. He's been a name other schools have eyed for months. It's natural to assume that he'll follow Eric Morris to Oklahoma State. But Mestemaker is expected to have robust options. There are several other QBs worth watching over the coming month. Some notable backups like Ohio State's Lincoln Kienholz and Oregon's Austin Novasad have decisions to make. There are other very productive Group of Five QBs like Arkansas State's Jaylen Raynor or Parker Navarro from Ohio worth keeping track of. There are also a few more established starters who could shake if things become further unsettled at their current situations. The news keeps coming with three weeks to go. Don't expect it to stop anytime soon. \nNorth Texas' Drew Mestemaker is expected to among the most coveted quarterbacks in the transfer portal. \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Teams in needMiami: The Hurricanes are likely to dip into the portal for a third straight offseason in pursuit of a quarterback with Carson Beck's impending graduation. Though, there is some internal optimism about the development of Emory Williams.Texas Tech: The Red Raiders love backup quarterback Will Hammond, but he tore his ACL in late October. Given that there's no guarantee of him being ready for next season, Texas Tech is expected to go after a starter-quality passer in the portal. Money tends to be no object in Lubbock.Indiana: Indiana's made the playoff in back-to-back years with a transfer quarterback, and it will try to do so a third time in 2026. Expect Indiana to go and get a guy to replace Fernando Mendoza.\nLSU: Could it just end up being Trinidad Chambliss? That's certainly possible if he can secure a waiver. Either way, the Tigers are expected to be in the portal market for a high-level starter, and Lane Kiffin makes the Tigers a super attractive option.Florida State: There had been some thought that Tommy Castellanos could qualify for an additional season of college football via a waiver. It could still happen, but there's a good chance of Florida State hopping into the high-end portal quarterback market either way.That top of the market could grow, too, depending on a few big quarterback decisions. Oregon quarterback Dante Moore could end up going to the draft which would mean Oregon jumping into the fray. The tenor around his situation has shifted in recent weeks with industry sources now considering the NFL a more likely option for Moore.\nAuburn will have a decision to make about its 2026 signal-caller. Deuce Knight is a potential superstar and seems to be an ideal on-paper fit for Golesh's system. Knight has also started just one game. I would expect the Tigers to pursue an experienced option.Clemson, believe it or not, is also a team to watch in the quarterback market. The Tigers have indicated to agents that quarterback is a potential need this cycle as they replace Cade Klubnik. Whether that's a high-end starter or someone to compete with Christopher Vizzina remains to be seen.There are also a lot of other teams expected to go get a guy. Illinois, Virginia Tech, Louisville and Baylor will all likely need starting arms, and that's just the tip of the iceberg.\n            ",

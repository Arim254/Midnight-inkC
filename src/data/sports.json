Brady Kannon, who is 26-9-2 (+1590) over his last 37 NFL ATS picks, is backing the Chargers (+3.5) to cover versus New England on Sunday night.\"Patriots' schedule has been a sore spot for their supporters all season but there is no denying, they played hardly any good teams. They were 2-2 vs playoff teams, splitting with the Bills and also splitting with the Panthers and Steelers, the two worst teams in the tournament. Chargers were 3-2 vs playoff teams (not counting Week 18) and had to face Denver, Philly, Steelers, Jaguars, and Texans. LAC also has the better point differential vs common opponents. They have an excellent formula for playoff football: a rushing attack, a pass rush, and an excellent defense. When I crunch my numbers, I come up with LAC as a 1-point favorite. I'll gladly take anything greater than a field goal and they just might win outright.\" Kannon's Wild Card NFL picks can be found here.Bet the Chargers to cover at DraftKings:\nSteelers vs. Texans Monday night picks Something has to give on NFL Wild Card Monday as the Steelers have lost six straight postseason games, while the Texans are 0-6, all-time, in road playoff games. Both of these squads enter their Monday night meeting with nine against-the-spread wins this season as they will meet in a playoff game for the first time ever. R.J. White, who is 37-20-1 (+1455) over his last 58 ATS picks in Steelers games, is backing Pittsburgh (+3.5) to cover.\"The Steelers are in the playoffs by the skin of their teeth, and the market is treating them as DOA. But I'm not underrating a team that scored 25+ points in nine of its last 12 games, even managing it in the finale without DK Metcalf. He's back, as is T.J. Watt, and when you throw in Mike Tomlin as one of the best coaches in football, the current version of Pittsburgh rates above average for me. The Texans' elite defense gave up 30 points to Riley Leonard and the offense has been inconsistent, getting shut down in Week 16 by the Raiders of all teams. Pittsburgh is live for the win here at home against an indoors team playing in a tough road environment.\" See more Texans vs. Steelers picks here.Pick Pittsburgh to cover at DraftKings:\n            ",

L.A. is also facing a team with an 8-9 record, and teams with losing records are 2-6 in the playoffs all-time. The Rams have the league's best offense, ranking first in points, total yards and yards per play, and it's a unit that doesn't hurt itself as no one has committed fewer penalties. Matthew Stafford has two touchdowns and no interceptions in each of his last three postseason starts, and the MVP contender is riding a seven-game playoff streak with multiple touchdown passes. This season, Stafford has more TD passes (46) than Carolina has total touchdowns (35) as the Panthers rank 27th in both points scored and total yards. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Panthers can coverIt was just six weeks ago that Carolina upset the Rams as double-digit underdogs, forcing Stafford into three turnovers. The Panthers have 10 ATS wins as an underdog this year, the most in the NFL, and they also have a one-day rest advantage after playing last Saturday. The Rams have lost three of their last four road games, and the Panthers are decidedly more potent on offense at Bank of America Stadium. Five of their six highest point totals this year have come at home, and the most points they scored all year came versus Los Angeles in Week 13. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Rams vs. Panthers picksSportsLine's model has simulated Panthers vs. Rams 10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 48 combined points.

    "body": "\n        The Chicago Cubs in 2025 made the playoffs for the first time in a while and advanced a round, but coming in second place in the NL Central to the Milwaukee Brewers and then losing the NLDS to that same Brewers team should be filed under \"not good enough.\" In light of that, this is a big offseason for club president Jed Hoyer. On Wednesday, the Cubs finally struck a big blow, landing potential frontline starter Edward Cabrera from the Marlins.That's a good move. It could even be a big move. Is it good enough? Let's examine where things stand with the North Siders.\n        \n            \n                Edward Cabrera trade: Cubs acquire Marlins frontline starter for top outfield prospect\n                \n                    Dayn Perry                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe rotationThis should be set. There are three potential frontline starters in Cabrera, Matthew Boyd and Cade Horton. Cabrera has ace-caliber stuff at times and finally made a career-high 26 starts last season in 137 ⅔ innings, striking out 150. Boyd ran out of gas late last season -- his first full season since returning from Tommy John surgery -- but had a 2.34 ERA through his first 22 starts. Horton was 11-4 with a 2.67 ERA in 118 innings as a rookie.\nThis isn't a stable of 200-inning guys, at least not yet, so the Cubs need depth. They've got it. Shota Imanaga returns and he's flashed frontline upside at times. Veteran righty Jameson Taillon is back as well. Colin Rea can serve as a swingman but made 27 starts last season and is a fine sixth starter. Past those six, there's Justin Steele, who will return from Tommy John surgery at some point. Remember, he had a 3.10 ERA in 78 starts from 2022-24. Javier Assad is also a swingman type like Rea. That's eight options for starting pitchers down the stretch and, if everything breaks right, four frontline starters for a playoff rotation in Horton, Cabrera, Steele and Boyd with Imanaga as a fallback.My expectation is the Cubs are done looking for starting pitching now after the Cabrera acquisition. This is a good stable with the upside being one of the most productive rotations in baseball. \nWhat's next? The Cubs had a robust offense in the first three months last season before it sputtered down the stretch. What made the Cubs great in the first half was the emergence of Pete Crow-Armstrong as a big-time power hitter, Kyle Tucker doing Kyle Tucker things and Seiya Suzuki posting the best several months of his life. In the second half, PCA struggled, Tucker dealt with injuries and the worst slump of his career and the streaky Suzuki reverted to the bad part of the streakiness. As the 2026 roster stands today, the Cubs have a good number of quality hitters -- to varying degrees -- who aren't superstar-caliber bats like Michael Busch, Dansby Swanson, Ian Happ and Nico Hoerner along with supporting cast types like Carson Kelly/Miguel Amaya (the catchers) and Matt Shaw. The front office is relying on Shaw taking a big leap forward, Moisés Ballesteros becoming a monster DH and Suzuki and PCA hitting all year like they did in the first half. Still, there are plenty of questions in there from a team looking to win the division and make a deep playoff run. \nAnother middle-of-the-order bat would sure make things look more promising. The Cubs have been attached in rumors to free agent infielders Bo Bichette and Alex Bregman. Tucker remains a free agent, as does former Cubs outfielder Cody Bellinger. How might things fit?The infieldBusch is firmly entrenched at first, as is Swanson at short. Hoerner, at second, was one of the best \"glue guys\" in baseball last year, but trade rumors are circulating because he's only signed through 2026. Shaw was good in the second half and could come back at third. This is to say that the Cubs aren't desperately in need of filling an infield hole. Grabbing someone from outside the organization would be an effort to upgrade the team. The weak link there right now is clearly Shaw and that's where Bregman comes in. Shaw could then be traded or become a utility backup (he could play third to rest Bregman, play second to rest Hoerner or Swanson -- with Hoerner playing shortstop when Swanson sits, etc.). \nBichette's fit is slightly trickier. He played second base for the Blue Jays at the end of the season; would he do the same for the Cubs, leaving Shaw at third (and Hoerner either on the bench or traded)? What about third base to replace Shaw?Regardless, either Bregman or Bichette would be a big get for the offense, especially if they did so while holding onto Hoerner. The outfieldFor ease, we'll include the DH role here too. Remember, last season with Tucker in the fold, the Cubs set up with Happ in left field, PCA in center and Tucker in right while Suzuki was the primary DH. If the Cubs don't bring in another outfielder, it looks like Happ-PCA-Suzuki is the outfield set up with Ballesteros taking over as the primary DH. \nIf the Cubs fail to bring in an infielder like Bregman or Bichette, perhaps they turn their attention to the outfield, especially with Owen Caissie now gone as part of the Cabrera trade. Tucker would make sense, but the Cubs' front office -- whether it's Hoyer or ownership -- seems content to operate as a middle-market team. This is to say, Tucker's demands on the free agent market appear too rich for the Cubs' blood. This could leave an opening for a Bellinger reunion. He was great in 2023 and pretty good in 2024 before the Cubs traded him to make room for Tucker. He's coming off his best year since his 2019 MVP season. \nWould the Cubs bring Bellinger back to beef up their lineup? I think this only becomes a discussion if they miss out on both Bregman and Bichette. If you look at a potential lineup right now, though, it sure seems like they could use another big bopper in the middle: 1. Michael Busch, 1B2. Nico Hoerner, 2B3. Ian Happ, LF4. Seiya Suzuki, RF5. Pete Crow-Armstrong, CF6. Dansby Swanson, SS7. Moisés Ballesteros, DH8. Carson Kelly, C9. Matt Shaw, 3B\nIt's pretty good. It just seems like, come the middle of October, we'd be saying once again that it wasn't good enough. \n            ",

The trio -- along with a fourth suspect -- are accused of stealing $200,000 in property from the Cleveland Browns quarterback during his NFL debut in Week 11.While Sanders was getting his first taste of NFL action, three suspects allegedly entered Sanders' home wearing masks and gloves shortly before 7 p.m. and made off with roughly $200,000 in property. A fourth suspect was driving the vehicle that transported the group. While three of those suspects are now in custody, one more remains at large with an active warrant out for his arrest.Sanders is far from the only high-profile NFL player who has been burglarized during a game. In 2024, the homes of Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce were robbed during a game. Additionally, Joe Burrow's house was broken into during a \"Monday Night Football\" game.On the day his home was robbed, Sanders replaced an injured Dillon Gabriel against the Baltimore Ravens. In his first NFL game, Sanders completed four of his 16 passing attempts for 47 yards and an interception. Sanders remained the Browns' starting quarterback for the rest of the season, completing 56.6% of his passes for 1,400 yards, seven touchdowns and 10 interceptions.\nSanders and the entire Browns organization is entering a new era this offseason after the firing of coach Kevin Stefanski, who spent six seasons with the team.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\nArsenal are 14 points clear of Liverpool in the Premier League table when the two sides meet on Thursday, Jan. 8 in the second matchup of the year between them. Liverpool are one of two clubs to defeat Arsenal in domestic play, though the Gunners have been able to pull away from most of the league in an effort to capture the club's first EPL title since 2003-04. Arsenal enter this match on a five-game winning streak while Liverpool have drawn their last two matches after winning three in a row.Kickoff from Emirates Stadium in London is set for 3 p.m. ET. Arsenal are -180 favorites (wager $180 to win $100) in the latest Arsenal vs. Liverpool odds at DraftKings Sportsbook while Liverpool are +475 underdogs (wager $100 to win $475). A draw is priced at +330 and the total is set at 2.5 (Over -135, Under +105). You can find the latest projections for Arsenal vs. Liverpool at SportsLine but before locking in any bets, you should see where soccer expert Jon Eimer is leaning towards for this high-stakes clash.Eimer finished 2023 as SportsLine's No. 1 soccer expert, posting a 248-234-12 (+25.93 units) record on SportsLine article picks. Eimer has been red-hot in 2025, posting a profit in multiple leagues, including the Premier League, Champions League, La Liga and more. Anyone following his soccer betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting apps could have seen huge returns.  Here are Eimer's best bets and analysis for Arsenal vs. Liverpool on Thursday.Arsenal vs. Liverpool best betsArsenal money line and Over 1.5 goals (-120): 1uBoth teams to score (-120): 1uExact score: Arsenal 3-1 (+1200): 1uManchester City keep dropping pointsArsenal have been motivated all season as the team is pressing towards a long overdue EPL title. The team, however, has found some additional motivation as Manchester City keep dropping points. The Citizens have now dropped points from a winning position in back-to-back fixtures. We watched them lose two points after a draw to Chelsea, followed by a 1-1 draw to Brighton.This means that a victory against Liverpool would put Arsenal a full nine points ahead of the next best team on the table. Arsenal will look to be as aggressive as ever knowing the importance of three points against a club as big as Liverpool.Liverpool's key absencesLiverpool have put together a strong run of performances as they are unbeaten in the last nine matches. While they are not losing, they still don't look like their usual dominate self, having dropped points to Fulham and Leeds. They barely beat Wolves 2-1. This team is struggling to find form and their injuries and international duties aren't helping.Alexander Isak and Hugo Ekitike are both out in this match due to injury while Mo Salah is still gone for AFCON duties. The lack of a clear goalscorer and a leaky backline means that Liverpool are in for a rough time against the best club in Europe. I still believe Liverpool will score as Arsenal have conceded in four of their last five but ultimately, this should be a comfortable three points for the Gunners.\n            ",

In the four years since, Newton hasn't been on the best terms with the franchise, highlighting in 2024 that he wasn't invited to be part of the team's trip to Germany like other franchise legends. \"Did it hurt my feelings? Yeah, it did,\" Newton said on his '4th&1' podcast in 2024. \"As a man, I'm like, damn bro, I gave this city everything.\"\nHowever, with the team playing their first home playoff game in a decade -- and making their first trip to the postseason in general since the 2017-18 season -- Newton is a fitting selection to fire up the crowd. That 2015-16 season was the pinnacle of the Newton era, as he won NFL MVP honors at the peak of his powers and took the Panthers to the Super Bowl. While they lost there to the Broncos, the 2016 NFC Championship Game in Charlotte saw Newton lead Carolina to a 49-15 win that remains the franchise's high point. This year's Panthers team enters Saturday's game with the Rams in a very different place than Newton's 2015 squad. Carolina went 8-9 and limped into the postseason thanks to a Falcons win over the Saints. The Panthers went 1-3 in their last four, finishing in a three-way tie for the division title that Carolina held the tiebreaker. As a result, Carolina is a 10.5-point underdog to the Rams in the Wild Card round, which would be make them the largest home underdog in the Super Bowl era. \nThat means they'll have to pull off one of the all-time playoff upsets on Saturday to advance, and they will be bringing out all the stops to get the vibe right on Saturday, including Newton's return to Charlotte. \n            \n    ",

The Hurricanes were the final at-large team selected for the field Miami's path to the semifinals began with a road upset of Texas A&M, followed by a win over reigning national champion Ohio State. Ole Miss followed a different route. The Rebels opened the playoff with a home win over Tulane before stunning Georgia. Their postseason run came amid significant turbulence, as former coach Lane Kiffin departed for LSU days before CFP Selection Sunday. Ole Miss responded by promoting defensive coordinator Pete Golding to head coach, a move that has quickly paid dividends. Thursday's game also features a compelling quarterback matchup between Ole Miss' Trinidad Chambliss and Miami's Carson Beck.\nPeach Bowl -- (5) Oregon vs. (1) Indiana -- Friday at 7:30 p.m. on ESPN, fuboTV (try for free): There is a chance this quarterback matchup could feature the No. 1 and No. 2 overall picks in the 2026 NFL Draft. Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza is already drawing significant buzz as a potential top pick, while Oregon signal caller Dante Moore could be the second quarterback selected if he declares. Indiana is coming off the biggest win in program history, and the stakes will be even higher this weekend. Oregon, meanwhile, sits one win away from playing for the first national championship in program history after being eliminated in the quarterfinals last year as the No. 1 overall seed. The Big Ten is guaranteed a spot in the national championship game for the third consecutive season after Michigan and Ohio State represented the league in back-to-back years.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        With the calendar flipping to 2026, we're officially in a World Cup year, and performances mean quite a bit more for players looking to make the squads of teams who have qualified. A run of form at the right time can be the difference between making the squad and watching from the couch at home. It's even more significant if you play for a host country like the United States, as Leeds' Brenden Aaronson does. His brace on Wednesday may not have been enough to secure victory over Newcastle United as they lost 4-3, but it is a moment that shows how a confident Aaronson has arrived in the Premier League at just the right time. It's the second consecutive game with a goal for Aaronson, and now his fourth goal contribution (three goals and one assist) in the past four games for Leeds. He couldn't pick a better time to round into form, both helping the team move further away from the relegation zone and also strengthening his case for Mauricio Pochettino's World Cup squad. Neither of those things seemed close to a given for Aaronson at the beginning of the season.Despite playing a large role in Leeds United's return to the top flight from the Championship, Aaronson had to fight for his spot in the Premier League. It's something that he's familiar with after falling out of the starting XI during the 2022-23 season when Leeds were relegated to the Championship and then having been sent on loan to Union Berlin in the Bundesliga, for the following season, where he then struggled for playing time. Once again needing to earn his spot was just another preseason for the American. \nUnder Daniel Farke, Aaronson has done just that, and he's also been played in a more advanced role, almost as a second forward with striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin. It's a role that he's been thriving in now, netting his fourth goal of the season. Not known as a goal scorer by trade, that's Aaronson's highest goal return ever in a top five league, and currently is in a tie as his third best league scoring season for any of the clubs that he's ever played at. With 2.89 expected goals on the season, Aaronson's running a little hot, but he's not drastically overperforming either, and with shots like his against Newcastle, you can see why he's doing more with less (his goals have come from a grand total of 13 shots on target).\nThat's a finish of a confident player, and at 25, Aaronson is playing some of the best soccer of his career, which is also being noticed by the national team. After being left out of the USMNT's squad for the Concacaf Nations League and the September international window under Pochettino, it seemed like Aaronson might be at risk of not making the World Cup, but as the USMNT closed out 2025 with three consecutive wins, the Leeds man was involved in all of them.\nIt's still a long road to make the World Cup in 2026, but Aaronson is doing what he needs to do to ensure that he'll have a chance for the next tests along the way, friendlies facing Belgium and Portugal in March. Pass those tests, and the second World Cup of Aaronson's career could be in his future. \n            ",

    "body": "\nThe previous three times the San Antonio Spurs lost back-to-back games, they bounced back with a victory. Coach Mitch Johnson is hoping his team can respond the same way this time around.San Antonio (25-11) looks to avoid its first three-game losing streak of the season when it hosts the surging Los Angeles Lakers (23-11) on Wednesday at 9:30 p.m. ET. Two of the top three teams in the Western Conference, the Spurs and Lakers met twice in Los Angeles earlier this season, with each posting a victory.Both clubs have a quick turnaround, as the Spurs dropped a 106-105 decision to the Grizzlies in Memphis on Tuesday while the Lakers recorded a 111-103 triumph over the Pelicans in New Orleans. It was the third consecutive victory for Los Angeles, which will be without starting guards Austin Reaves and Rui Hachimura due to calf injuries and also could be missing LeBron James, as the superstar has yet to play in a back-to-back this season.There are 11 other games on Wednesday's NBA schedule, one of which has the Toronto Raptors (22-15) visiting the Spectrum Center to take on the Charlotte Hornets (13-23) at 7 p.m. ET. Both teams are seeking a third straight victory, as Toronto swept a pair of home meetings with the Atlanta Hawks while Charlotte posted road wins against the Chicago Bulls and defending NBA champion Oklahoma City Thunder.Five games are on the NHL slate, including a showdown between the Calgary Flames (18-20-4) and Montreal Canadiens (23-13-6) at 7:30 p.m. ET at the Bell Centre. The Canadiens edged the Flames 2-1 in overtime when the clubs met in Calgary in late October.Meanwhile, a plethora of college basketball games take place on Wednesday, with one being an Atlantic 10 Conference clash between Saint Louis (13-1) and VCU (11-4) on CBS Sports Network. It tips off at 7 p.m. ET at the Siegel Center in Richmond, Va. The Billikens enter the matchup with a seven-game winning streak, while the Rams have posted five consecutive victories.The Spurs are 8.5-point favorites against the Lakers in the latest consensus NBA odds, while the Raptors are 1.5-point favorites versus the Hornets. The Canadiens are -149 on the money line against the Flames, and VCU is a 3.5-point favorite versus Saint Louis.Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Wednesday, Jan. 7. All times EasternNBA best bets, where to watchRaptors at HornetsTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Charlotte | TV: NBA League Pass | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Raptors -124 | Expert: Kon Knueppel Over 17.5 points (-127, Mike Barner)The Hornets have given the Raptors fits this season, winning two of their previous three meetings and losing by just two points in the other. Toronto has been playing well of late, however, as it has won four of its last five contests and is coming off back-to-back triumphs over Atlanta -- both by at least 17 points. The Hornets have yet to post three consecutive victories this season, and the SportsLine Projection Model doesn't see it happening now, as the Raptors win in 56% of its simulations. SportsLine NBA expert Mike Barner believes Charlotte guard Kon Knueppel will continue to be a solid contributor offensively, as the rookie has scored at least 18 points in 10 of his last 11 contests.Lakers at SpursTime: 9:30 p.m. | Location: San Antonio | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Spurs -8.5 (-102) | Expert: Julian Champagnie Over 17.5 points + rebounds (-128, PropBetGuy)There's a good chance James will sit out this contest after matching Luka Doncic for the team lead with 30 points in Tuesday's triumph over New Orleans. With Reaves and Hachimura already sidelined, the Lakers won't have many scoring options other than Doncic, leaving them ripe for a blowout loss. The Spurs won by 13 points when the teams met in Los Angeles last month, and the Lakers had all three of those players in the lineup. Considering all that, the SportsLine Projection Model's simulations have San Antonio covering the spread 53% of the time. SportsLine props expert PropBetGuy (34-19, +1205 on his last 53 NBA player prop picks) feels Spurs forward Julian Champagnie will receive a large amount of playing time and make the most of it, as he has recorded more than 17 points and rebounds combined in 11 of the last 15 games in which he's played at least 26 minutes.NHL best bets, where to watchFlames at CanadiensTime: 7:30 p.m. | Location: Montreal | TV: ESPN+ | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Under 6.5 (-136) | Expert: Canadiens ML (-146, Matt Severance)The Canadiens are eighth in the NHL in scoring with 141 goals, but the Flames are 30th with 112 -- just five more than the last-place St. Louis Blues. Five of Calgary's last six games have had a total of six goals or fewer, and these teams combined for only three when they faced off in October. The SportsLine Projection Model has taken all of that information into account, and as a result, the Under hits in more than 52% of its simulations. SportsLine expert Matt Severance (12-6, +525.5 on his last 18 NHL money-line picks) likes the Canadiens to prevail as they return from a seven-game road trip (4-1-2), especially since the Flames are just 6-13-2 on the road this season.CBB best bets, where to watchSaint Louis at VCUTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Richmond, Va. | TV: CBS Sports Network | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Under 171.5 (-112) | Expert: Saint Louis +2.5 (-108, Larry Hartstein)The Rams have been involved in some high-scoring affairs of late, but the same cannot be said of the Billikens. Only three of Saint Louis' last 11 games have had more than 171 total points scored, and two of them had a combined 172 produced. The SportsLine Projection Model sees that trend continuing, as its simulations have the Under hitting almost 73% of the time. SportsLine expert Larry Hartstein likes the Billikens to cover the spread since they are second in the nation with a plus-27.5 point scoring margin.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        John Harbaugh and Mike Tomlin faced off for the 44th and final time this past Sunday night as the coaches of the Baltimore Ravens and Pittsburgh Steelers, respectively. Harbaugh, who was the second-longest-tenured coach in the NFL behind Tomlin, was fired less than 48 hours after Baltimore's 26-24 loss to Pittsburgh that eliminated the Ravens from postseason contention. Tomlin, whose own future with the Steelers has also been a hot-button topic the past few seasons, said Wednesday that Harbaugh became an example of a \"sport culture\" that lacks \"patience.\" Harbaugh won a Super Bowl and guided the Ravens to the playoffs in six of the last eight years but was let go after coming up just short of winning a third straight division title. \"I just have so much respect for Harbs,\" Tomlin said on the Rich Eisen Show. \"Our stories will forever be interwoven in this rivalry that we've been fortunate and honored enough to be a part of. I've just got so much respect for him and how he's gone about his business, and we've certainly had some legendary battles over the years. \"You know, in terms of him being let go, unfortunately, I just think it's a component of today's sport culture. There have been many examples of that, and so it's unfortunate, but I'm sure that he is going to move on. And if he chooses to coach again ... I'm sure he'll be very successful at doing so. But more than anything, I just think it's a larger example of today's sport culture in terms of not a lot of patience and the entertainment component of what it is that we do. There's just not a lot of longevity.\n\"I'm sure we all would like to be Don Shula and Tom Landry, but I think those days are gone.\" \n        \n            \n                Ravens fire John Harbaugh: Five landing spots for Super Bowl champion coach, including team with no vacancy\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTomlin 'tunnel-visioned,' doesn't think about own futureTomlin, in his 19th season with the Steelers, is the NFL's longest-tenured head coach. With Harbaugh out in Baltimore, Andy Reid is now the second-longest tenured coach as he just concluded his 13th season with the Kansas City Chiefs. No other coach has been with their team prior to the start of the 2017 season. \"I'm miles away from Tom Landry and Don Shula,\" Tomlin said with a laugh. Tomlin, whose Steelers will host the Houston Texans next Monday night in the AFC wild card, round has two years remaining on his contract after this season. He said that while he appreciates the \"stability and steadiness\" of the Steelers' ownership, he doesn't spend much time thinking about his contract status.\n\"I'm tunnel-visioned,\" Tomlin said. \"As a leader, I'm called upon to serve these guys. NFL playing careers are very short, and so I certainly can't seek comfort in the longevity of my career. I work with guys who have very short careers, and I just tend to try to always mirror that urgency. I think it's disrespectful not to have that level of urgency when I lead them. ... Very rarely do I delve into big picture perspectives or appreciate the longevity component of what I've been able to do. There's just so many things that are waiting for me today, this week, that demand my attention.\"Can Steelers make a playoff run?Tomlin has the record for the most consecutive seasons without a losing season to start a coaching career, which reached 19 this year. He recently tied Steelers Hall of Fame coach Chuck Noll with 193 regular season wins and is two seasons away from tying Landry's record for the most consecutive non-losing seasons in NFL history. Playoff wins have eluded Tomlin's teams in recent years, though. The Steelers haven't won a playoff game since the 2016 AFC divisional round. After winning five of his first six playoff games, including a Super Bowl in just his second season, Tomlin's teams are just 3-10 in the postseason since.  \nPittsburgh's lack of recent playoff success has led to criticism of Tomlin and some clamoring for Steelers president Art Rooney II to consider going in a different direction. The noise level grew this season when the Steelers lost five games over a seven-game stretch that left them at 6-6. The Steelers, as they often have under Tomlin, responded with a winning streak that culminated with last Sunday night's win over the Ravens that clinched Pittsburgh's eighth division title under Tomlin. \"I just realize it's a component of what I do and what we do, and you better learn to live with it, or at least endure it,\" Tomlin said of the outside noise. \"You know, there's more US senators than NFL head coaches. I have a respect and appreciation for that, and an understanding of maybe some of the things that come with that.\"As he approaches 20 years on the job, Tomlin is just as energized for the job as he was when he accepted the position on Jan. 22, 2007. \n\"Hey, I'm institutionalized,\" he said. \"Man, I gotta have it. I just love the challenges week in and week out that this job provides. The growth in it, the collective growth, the individual growth. A lot of lessons that I've learned in life have been through my football experiences. I've been on the team every year of my life since 1980, and so I really appreciate it.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        For one final time during the regular season, we've updated our bowl game and College Football Playoff projections coming out of rivalry weekend ahead of the selection committee's penultimate top 25 rankings on Tuesday. This will be a telling poll from the committee for teams on the bubble, including BYU, Miami, Vanderbilt and Texas, among others.Miami won its fourth straight game in convincing fashion at Pittsburgh to end with season and leave the committee with something to think about during deliberations. And for Texas, no team during rivalry weekend managed a more emphatic victory after the Longhorns squashed Texas A&M's unbeaten season.The way we see it, the following teams are playoff locks entering conference championship weekend: Ohio State, Indiana, Georgia, Texas Tech, Oregon and Ole Miss. Two other seeds are going to the ACC and Group of Five winners, which leaves four at-large spots that are up for debate entering Tuesday night.Oklahoma, Notre Dame and Alabama were ranked in the Nos. 8, 9 and 10 spots last week, while BYU and Miami were essentially placeholders at Nos. 11 and 12. Those seeds will go to the final two conference champions, leaving the No. 10 seed to receive the final, coveted at-large selection.\nThe great Texas debateThe win over Texas A&M gave the Longhorns three victories this season over opponents ranked inside the current top 15 of the playoff rankings, but the other side to that equation? The losses. While the committee could justify putting Texas as the first three-loss, at-large team to ever make the field, who the Longhorns would replace as a result is the bigger dilemma.Then, there's the game control metric. The Longhorns suffered a 25-point loss at Georgia this month and lost to a 3-9 Florida team in October whose only win since came against Mississippi State, a team Texas beat after falling behind by 17 points in the fourth quarter. Kentucky took the Longhorns to overtime, while Arkansas piled up 512 yards of total offense and 37 points against Texas last week. The Razorbacks finished 2-10 and winless in SEC play this season.And what will be particularly difficult to swallow for the Longhorns is the fact there's potentially four programs from the state of Texas that will make the field without one of them being college football's preseason No. 1.\nElsewhere, more than a dozen teams with five wins entering Saturday needed a victory to reach bowl eligibility, and only seven managed to do so: Penn State, Kansas State, Army, Texas State, Arkansas State, Louisiana, Georgia Southern and Washington State. We're expecting Missouri State (7-5) and Delaware (6-6) to fill the final two spots after transitioning from FCS this season.Here's a glance at how we see the final 12-team CFP bracket unfolding next month coming out of rivalry weekend:College Football Playoff Quarterfinals DateGame / LocationProjectionJan. 1 Rose BowlPasadena, Calif.(1) Ohio State vs. (8/9) WinnerJan. 1 Sugar BowlNew Orleans, La.(2) Georgia vs. (7/10) WinnerJan. 1 Orange BowlMiami, Fla.(3) Indiana vs. (6/11) WinnerDec. 31 Cotton BowlArlington, Texas(4) Texas Tech vs. (5/12) WinnerFirst roundDate LocationProjectionWinner facesDec. 19 or 20Oklahoma Memorial StadiumNorman, Okla.(8) Oklahoma vs. (9) Notre Dame(1) Ohio StateDec. 19 or 20Vaught-Hemingway StadiumOxford, Miss.(7) Ole Miss vs. (10) Alabama(2) GeorgiaDec. 19 or 20Autzen StadiumEugene, Ore.(6) Oregon vs. (11) Virginia(3) IndianaDec. 19 or 20Kyle FieldCollege Station, Texas(5) Texas A&M vs. (12) North Texas(4) Texas TechDon't see your team? Check out Brad Crawford's complete bowl projections.Projected College Football Playoff Field breakdown1. Ohio State (projected Big Ten champion): Now that the losing skid at Michigan is over and the Buckeyes are playing for the No. 1 seed in the Big Ten Championship Game, the \"second season\" for Ryan Day's program begins now. And by the time Ohio State opens its playoff run in the second round next month, quarterback Julian Sayin could be a Heisman winner.2. Georgia (projected SEC champion): Kirby Smart and the Bulldogs have a chance to avenge a previous loss to Alabama this season in Atlanta to secure a top-four seed and opening-round bye. Texas A&M's loss to Texas opened the door for Georgia, who battled through a physical affair with Georgia Tech and will try to make it 11 wins before the final bracket's determined next weekend.3. Indiana: As our projected Big Ten runner-up, the Hoosiers would likely get the No. 3 seed at 12-1 overall. The only thing that matters for Indiana from this point is its path to a national championship game appearance once the conference title is decided next weekend. Ohio State could potentially have a tougher draw with a second-round showdown with Notre Dame than Indiana, who may face a foe it's familiar with in Oregon.4. Texas Tech (projected Big 12 champion): The Red Raiders played like a team with a top-four seed to secure during rivalry weekend, humiliating West Virginia on the road with another crushing performance defensively. Ranked fourth in game control coming into the regular-season finale, Texas Tech scored touchdowns on its first three possessions. A win over BYU next week locks in a first-round bye, and that's our expectation.5. Texas A&M: That one stings. Unblemished no more after the road hiccup at Texas, not only do the Aggies miss out on a chance at winning their first SEC title, but Texas A&M likely misses a first-round layoff after being ranked inside the top four of every playoff ranking up to this point. A consolation prize for the loss to Texas will be a sold-out, crazy environment inside Kyle Field next month.6. Oregon: Behind a couple touchdowns from Dante Moore in a gritty road performance at quarterback, the Ducks solidified a first-round home game inside Autzen Stadium with a nice finish at Washington. Oregon's going back to the playoff under Dan Lanning and will try and make good on last year's early exit, this time making the field as an at-large selection. Oregon will be the Big Ten's third selection inside the top six.7. Ole Miss: Committee chair Hunter Yurachek acknowledged that a Lane Kiffin departure would be another data point that could be used during final deliberations, but when the Rebels have a sparkling head-to-head win at Oklahoma on their resume, would they really be dropped behind the Sooners -- or worse -- at the final hour? We don't think so. Not the way these two teams are playing down the stretch.8. Oklahoma: This team's been taking on water since the win over Alabama due to anemic play offensively, but when you're as good on the other side of the football as Brent Venables' bunch, you live to fight another day. Oklahoma's rugged win over LSU on Saturday should secure a home playoff game for the Sooners, but John Mateer and Co. will need to be more explosive next month to have a shot at advancing. The Sooners have now won 89 straight games when holding an opponent under 21 points.9. Notre Dame: With Saturday's result at Stanford, those can argue against the Fighting Irish in favor of Miami until the cows come home -- the committee's not hearing it. They've slotted Notre Dame in an entirely different tier -- or pod -- since their first set of rankings earlier this month, and there's not a team in college football hotter than this group exiting the regular season. Notre Dame and Oklahoma are battling for that final home game designation.10. Alabama: The final at-large spot will be up for debate between Alabama, Miami (10-2), BYU (11-2 if Cougars lose to Texas Tech) and Texas (9-3), but we're expecting the Crimson Tide to get the nod. They would finish with three losses if they're unable to beat Georgia for a second time this season in next weekend's SEC Championship Game. Alabama has two wins over teams inside the committee's top 25 entering rivalry weekend (Georgia, Oklahoma) and won its playoff elimination game Saturday night at Auburn in the final moments to clinch a spot in Atlanta.11. Virginia: By virtue of a win over Virginia Tech and SMU's upset loss to Cal, the Cavaliers will play five-loss Duke in the ACC Championship Game. There's a scenario in which a Blue Devils victory in Charlotte could push projected Sun Belt champion James Madison to the bracket and keep the ACC out. Pure chaos.12. North Texas: The fourth and final team from Texas in the playoff will be the Mean Green after they take out Tulane in the American Championship Game next weekend. Tulane is the only Group of Five team ranked by the committee thus far, but we're sticking with Drew Mestemaker and red-hot North Texas to take out the Green Wave for the auto-bid. North Texas coach Eric Morris took the Oklahoma State job earlier this week but will stay with this team through conference championship weekend and the playoff -- if they get there.\n            ",

There were some late-game shenanigans that got me there.As it is, I am now 91-87 ATS and 122-55-1 straight up, which are solid records, if not special.This being Thanksgiving Week is always a challenge because there are four games before the weekend even gets here.The three Thanksgiving Day games and the Black Friday game all have intrigue with the Kansas City Chiefs at Dallas Cowboys on CBS being the most intriguing. The ratings for that should be through the roof.I like the Chiefs in that one, but here are the rest of my picks this week.Bet NFL Week 13 games and NFL odds at DraftKings, where new users who win a $5 wager get $300 in bonus bets and three free months of NBA League Pass.San Francisco 49ers (-4.5) at Cleveland BrownsSunday, 1 p.m. ET CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThis will be Shedeur Sanders making his first home start for the Browns. He was solid last week in the victory over the Raiders. But it's the Browns defense that will be the difference here. They are suffocating. Look for Brock Purdy to have troubles against them, yet he will find a way to win a close one late.Pick: 49ers 21, Browns 20 | Odds via DraftKings SportsbookJacksonville Jaguars (-6.5) at Tennessee TitansSunday, 1 p.m. ET CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThis is a be-careful game for the Jaguars with the Colts on deck next week. It's also a second-consecutive road game at a place they haven't played well in their history. Look for the Titans to hang around in this one, but the Jaguars will pull it out late.Pick: Jaguars 21, Titans 17 | Odds via Caesars SportsbookHouston Texans at Indianapolis Colts (-4.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nTexans quarterback C.J. Stroud remains in the concussion protocol, which means he might not play. That would mean another start for Davis Mills, who has played well. It's the Texans defense that has keyed the team's resurgence. The Colts lost to the Chiefs last week, but they will do something here that they needed to do more of in that game: Give it to Jonathan Taylor. Look for the Colts to win a tough, close one. Pick: Colts 23, Texans 21 | Odds via BetMGMAtlanta Falcons (-2.5) at New York Jets Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Falcons are out on the road for a second straight week, which is a challenge. They beat the Saints last week, thanks to the defense. That defense will play well here too, but I think the Jets defense will as well. It's a low-scoring game with the Jets pulling off the upset at home. Pick: Jets 19, Falcons 16 | Odds via FanDuel SportsbookNew Orleans Saints at Miami Dolphins (-6)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Dolphins are coming off a bye and won two straight before that. They've done it with a good running game with De'Von Achane and better defense. The Saints have offensive issues that will come into play here. Miami has seemed to right things and that will show up. Miami takes it.Pick: Dolphins 28, Saints 16 | Odds via BetMGMArizona Cardinals at Tampa Bay Buccaneers (-3)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nBucs quarterback Baker Mayfield suffered a shoulder sprain Sunday night that puts his status in doubt for this one. That means it could be Teddy Bridgewater. He is more than capable. The Cardinals have had success with Jacoby Brissett throwing it, but they are one-dimensional. The Tampa Bay defense wasn't good against the Rams, but I think they bounce back here. Bucs take it. Pick: Bucs 27, Cardinals 20 | Odds via DraftKings SportsbookLos Angeles Rams (-10.5) at Carolina PanthersSunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThis is a long trip for the Rams, but they get a Panthers team coming off a West Coast Monday night game. That evens it out. The Rams have an MVP leader in Matt Stafford on offense and a defense playing at a high level. Bryce Young wasn't good Monday night and he will struggle here too. Rams take it but the Panthers hang around behind their defense.Pick: Rams 24, Panthers 16 | Odds via FanDuel SportsbookMinnesota Vikings at Seattle Seahawks (-11.5)Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThis is the revenge game for Sam Darnold against the team he played with in 2025. He led that Vikings team to the playoffs and they didn't want him back. Now he's playing at a high level, while the Vikings have quarterback issues. With struggling J.J. McCarthy in the concession protocol, this could be rookie Max Brosmer making his first start. That's tough enough on the road, but in Seattle it's brutal. Seahawks big. Pick: Seahawks 30, Vikings 9 | Odds via Caesars SportsbookBuffalo Bills (-4) at Pittsburgh SteelersSunday, 4:25 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThis is a have-to for both these teams. Both are coming off road losses. The Steelers might have Aaron Rodgers back in this one, which they need. The Bills will have extra rest after playing last Thursday. That will give them time to get back on track. I think the Bills passing game will light up the Steelers pass defense. Bills take it. Pick: Bills 31, Steelers 22 | Odds via BetMGMLas Vegas Raiders at Los Angeles Chargers (-10)Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThe Chargers are coming off a bye, while the Raiders are coming off a horrible showing in a loss to the Browns. That offensive showing led to the firing of coordinator Chip Kelly. It won't matter. The offense is lifeless because the line is awful. The Chargers don't have a great line either, but give me Justin Herbert over Geno Smith.

    "body": "\n        While Lane Kiffin held the attention of the college football world for much of Saturday, and the weekend as a whole, there was still a massively entertaining weekend of rivalries and postseason-clinching games across the country. Conference title races and the College Football Playoff were top of mind as familiar foes clashed in the final week of the regular season, giving AP Top 25 poll voters one last full set of results to sort out the national landscape as we prepare for the postseason. Among the many adjustments that voters will have to address on their ballots is how to react to Texas' 27-17 win against rival Texas A&M on Friday night in Austin. It was the first loss of the season for an Aggies team that had peaked at No. 3, and also the best win of the season for a Longhorns team that has been bouncing up and down the rankings throughout a disjointed season that has ultimately ended with a 9-3 record. Texas A&M has been eliminated from the SEC title race but remains a lock for the College Football Playoff, while Texas now becomes the biggest thorn in the side of other hopeful at-large teams. The College Football Playoff selection committee, not the AP poll voters, will determine their final fate on Dec. 7. But how close the voters move Texas to the top 10 will kickstart the debate as to their worthiness for inclusion in the CFP as a three-loss team. \n        \n            \n                Bowl projections: Miami shines as bubble team in focus, Texas joins College Football Playoff discussion\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nElsewhere in the rankings, there were top-15 teams who logged impressive road wins, like Miami and Vanderbilt, and an adjustment for Michigan after the Wolverines lost at home to rival Ohio State. The Buckeyes were already a near-unanimous selection for No. 1 and would probably be after Week 14 if not for Indiana, who likewise closed out the season with a double-digit win against a rival but instead it was by 53 points and against Purdue. When Ohio State and Indiana play next Saturday night in the Big Ten Championship Game, it will not only be for the conference crown but also for the No. 1 spot in the rankings heading into the College Football Playoff. Here's how we think the new AP Top 25 poll will look after Week 14. 1. Ohio State (Last week — 1): A cathartic streak-snapping win for the Buckeyes at Michigan will have Ohio State in the Big Ten Championship Game and even more entrenched in their position as the No. 1 team in the country. \n2. Indiana (2): The Hoosiers walloped rival Purdue 56-3 on Friday night and cemented the 2025 team as the only squad in school history to have a 12-0 regular season. Indiana, like Ohio State, is now clinched for the Big Ten Championship Game and will have a chance to prove their worthiness for 1-seed consideration on the field in Indianapolis against the Buckeyes. 3. Georgia (4): This year's edition of \"Clean, Old Fashioned Hate\" was a bit of a rock fight, but Georgia got enough offense to secure a win and clinch the eighth 11-win season of Kirby Smart's head coaching tenure. Wins against Ole Miss, Texas and Tennessee are the core pieces of what voters have decided is the best one-loss profile in the country, and a lower-scoring rivalry win won't change those opinions. 4. Oregon (5):  The Ducks got a good fight from Washington on the road in their rivalry game, but an early lead and some explosive pass plays from Dante Moore in the second half helped Oregon get the 26-14 win. Now at 11-1, with the only loss coming to Indiana, Oregon is poised to not only move up in the rankings but also host a first-round game in the College Football Playoff. \n5. Ole Miss (6): While the college football world is clearly going to be concerned with the future of the Ole Miss program and its coaches, the team that is being judged by AP voters just finished one of the best regular seasons in school history with an 11-1 record. Being able to block out the noise and log a 38-19 win on the road against Mississippi State in the Egg Bowl speaks to the quality of the squad, which is set to for a slight bump up in the wake of Texas A&M's loss. 6. Texas A&M (3): There will obviously be a drop for the Aggies after losing at Texas on Friday night, but the number of spots in the adjustment might not be too dramatic. Texas A&M's one-loss resume isn't as strong as some other top-10 teams, but road wins against Notre Dame and Missouri will help when voters are making final decisions for the spots in this range on their ballots. 7. Texas Tech (7): The Red Raiders wrapped up the regular season with an emphatic statement win at West Virginia. Though Texas Tech was already clinched for the Big 12 title game, there was no sign of being distracted from the challenge at hand. Texas Tech led by 21 by the end of the first quarter and cruised to a 49-0 win, matching the 2008 school record for 11 wins in the regular season. \n8. Notre Dame (9): The Fighting Irish cruised to a solid win at Stanford that closes out the 10-2 regular season record that has been discussed since mid-September. Notre Dame needed to win 10 straight games after starting 0-2 and that's exactly what they did, so now with no conference title game left to play they await the final news on their postseason future. 9. Oklahoma (8): We are projecting that the Sooners could give up a spot in the wake of a 17-13 win against LSU that was much closer -- and tougher -- than expected heading into the matchup. John Mateer threw three interceptions and Oklahoma faced second half deficits of 10-3 and 13-10 before Isaiah Setagna broke loose for a 58-yard touchdown reception to give the Sooners the lead for good.  10. Alabama (10): The Crimson Tide won't see too much movement after the Iron Bowl win but have a tremendous opportunity to move up with an SEC Championship Game showdown ahead against Georgia.  \n11. BYU (11): It took about 15 minutes and a couple of possessions for BYU to wake up, but after spotting UCF a 14-0 lead, the Cougars turned the tables and outscored the visitors from Orlando 41-7 the rest of the afternoon. BYU, like Texas Tech, had a spot in the Big 12 title game clinched when they woke up on Saturday morning thanks to Arizona's win at Arizona State but needed a good showing for any chance of at-large consideration in the College Football Playoff. 12. Texas (16): The Longhorns were already the highest-ranked three-loss team in the country on the backs of head-to-head wins against Oklahoma and Vanderbilt. Now when you add in Friday night's win against Texas A&M, it's easy to see how voters will boost Texas to a point where they can jump some of the two-loss teams that stood between the Longhorns and the top 10. 13. Vanderbilt (12): Voters who were on the low end of Vanderbilt's ranking will surely correct that after the Commodores' 21-point win on the road at Tennessee, but it might not be enough for a big move up in the final poll. Vanderbilt's position will be strengthened, and there is likely no potential of getting jumped by Miami despite a close vote margin, but Texas' rise -- and the Longhorns' head-to-head edge -- could cap any upward movement.  \n14. Miami (13): After several trips north in late November that have gone poorly for Miami, it had to feel good to simply take care of business in the trap spot. Beating Pitt, a team the CFP Selection Committee moved into the rankings last week, by 31 points is going to be about as strong of a final statement as you could hope for when it comes to the Hurricanes' at-large hopes. 15. Utah (14): The Utes closed up another 10-win season with a solid 31-21 win at Kansas on Friday afternoon. Though the team is shut out of the Big 12 title picture, and possibly the CFP as well, it's still a strong response for the program after a couple of disappointing and injury-riddled seasons in 2023 and 2024.  16. Virginia (17): The Wahoos left no doubt on the field and closed out a 10-2 regular season campaign with a 27-7 win against rival Virginia Tech. Though the Hokies have been on interim coach status since September and entered with just three wins on the season, this was still a rivalry that had been dominated by Virginia Tech over the last 20 years and thus made for a nervy day leading up to kickoff. But now that the drama is settled, Virginia can turn its attention to the ACC Championship Game and preparing for a shot at the College Football Playoff. \n17. USC (19): The Trojans got off to a rough start against UCLA but rallied in the second half for a 29-10 win to finish the year 9-3 overall and 7-2 in Big Ten play.  18. Michigan (15): Losing to the No. 1 team in the country isn't going to come with a massive penalty in the rankings, but it does put the Wolverines in the same position as a three-loss USC team it lost to earlier this season. That can help serve as an anchor for voters looking to shuffle their ballots, where Michigan isn't punished for losing to the best team in the country but still gets sorted into a spot more in line with its record.  19. James Madison (20): The Dukes absolutely pounded Coastal Carolina, winning 59-10 to put an exclamation point on the first unbeaten team in Sun Belt play since Louisiana in 2021. Whether the crooked score will garner the attention of the College Football Playoff Selection Committee is yet to be determined, but the AP Top 25 poll voters who have been supportive of JMU for a few weeks will use the result to solidify the team's position.   \n20. North Texas (21): Eric Morris accepted the head coaching position at Oklahoma State earlier this week but his North Texas team showed no signs of being distracted, rolling Temple 52-25 on Friday. The Mean Green will now get a chance to play their way into the College Football Playoff through the American Championship Game next Friday night. 21. Tulane (22): With a sweat-free win against Charlotte, Tulane punched its ticket to the American Championship Game and now will look to make an impression on the College Football Playoff committee in hopes of being one of the highest-ranked conference champions.  22. Navy (NR): The Midshipmen were 27th in voting points last week and proceeded to beat Memphis by double-digits to close out a 9-2 regular season. With North Texas and Tulane advancing to the title game in the American, Navy now turns its attention to America's Game and beating Army in Baltimore on Dec. 13.   \n23. Arizona (NR): After a disastrous Year 1, Brent Brennan not only steadied the ship for Arizona football but led one of the better conference campaigns in the Big 12. The Wildcats beat rival Arizona to finish 9-3 overall and 6-3 in conference play, closing out the regular season with five straight wins. 24. Missouri (NR): The Tigers were just in the AP Top 25 poll two weeks ago and checked in at 28th in last week's balloting, so it's a team that's not far off the voters' radar. Missouri's rivalry week offering was a 14-point road win at Arkansas to cap off an 8-4 regular season record. 25. Iowa (NR): The Hawkeyes absolutely thrashed Nebraska on Friday afternoon to round out an 8-4 season. Voters could end up moving South Florida into this position as the Bulls are 9-3 after thrashing Rice, but Iowa's resume has only gotten stronger with the continued success of Indiana and Oregon. \nProjected to drop out: No. 18 Tennessee, No. 23 Georgia Tech, No. 24 Pittsburgh, No. 25 SMU  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The only thing that's better than Thanksgiving dinner is when you can break open the leftovers. As we gear up for a jam-packed Sunday slate of NFL action, there's no better time to dive into those final pieces of turkey while firing off some last-minute bets in the process. Given that we just went through a busy Thanksgiving and Black Friday allotment of games, it's easy to not have your eye on the ball in terms of how to wager for the rest of Week 13. And that's where we come in. Below, we're going to highlight our best bets for the remaining games on the slate and give out a pick for every other contest on the docket. One common theme that you'll find in our best bets is that we're backing the underdogs to cover, which would be a continuation of what we've seen earlier in Week 13 as all four prior matchups saw the underdog not only cover, pull off the outright upset. NFL odds courtesy of FanDuel Sportsbook.

Houston's defense is playing as well as any unit in the NFL right now. They rank first in the NFL in total yards per game allowed (264.3) and passer rating allowed (72.2), along with ranking second in points per game allowed (16.5). Meanwhile, Daniel Jones hasn't been as lights out as he was to begin the season. Over his last three starts, Jones has an 83.0 passer rating with five total touchdowns and seven turnovers compared to the 109.5 passer rating, 17 total touchdowns, and three turnovers in the eight games before that. This is the type of defense that can highlight the recent lull from Jones. While I think Indy can find a way to pull this out at home, it'll be within the number, and we'll be asking a lot of questions about this team's ceiling coming out of the contest. Projected score: Colts 24, Texans 21The pick: Texans +3.5Las Vegas Raiders at Los Angeles ChargersSunday, 4:25 p.m. ET (CBS | Paramount+)The Raiders are in a bad way, falling to 2-9 on the season last week following a loss to the Browns, which led to the firing of offensive coordinator Chip Kelly. It's possible that this move provides a momentary boost for the unit in this divisional matchup, but this pick has more to do with questions surrounding the Chargers than anything else. Let's not forget that this team came out extraordinarily flat in a 35-6 loss to the Jaguars before the Week 12 bye. While they'll be well-rested for this game, it doesn't necessarily mean Justin Herbert will be better protected. They are still without starting left tackle Joe Alt for the year, and Herbert's numbers have dipped in his absence. Without Alt, Herbert is averaging 6.4 yards per attempt and has eight touchdowns with six interceptions compared to the 8.3 yards per attempt average, 11 touchdowns, and three interceptions with him. Las Vegas has a pass rusher led by Maxx Crosby who can continue to give Herbert fits, so this stays within a double-digit game. Projected score: Chargers 23, Raiders 17The pick: Raiders +9.5San Francisco 49ers at Cleveland BrownsSunday, 1 p.m. ET (CBS | Paramount+)If it were up to Brock Purdy, the 49ers would've lost in Week 12. The 49ers quarterback tossed three first-half interceptions against the Panthers on Monday night, but was bailed out by his defense that allowed just three points off those turnovers en route to a win. And Purdy's struggles go beyond just this game as he's thrown seven interceptions in four starts this season overall. Now, he's asked to shake that off against a Browns defense that has been utterly dominant this season and is coming off a 10-sack performance in Week 12 against the Raiders. On the year, the unit is top three in the league in yards per game allowed (273.0), passing yards per game allowed (170.7), sacks (42), and third-down efficiency (34.5% opponent conversion rate). If Cleveland continues to play at that level, Purdy's issues could persist and keep the Browns within range of an upset. \nProjected score: 49ers 23, Browns 20The pick: Browns +4.5New York Giants at New England PatriotsMonday, 8:15 p.m. ET (ABC/ESPN | Fubo, try for free)The Patriots enter Week 13 atop the AFC as the No. 1 seed in the conference and the first club to reach 10 wins on the year. While they were able to notch a ninth straight win over the Bengals last week, it came at a cost. The entire left side of their offensive line went down due to injury, and both left tackle Will Campbell and left guard Jared Wilson are expected to miss time, including Monday's contest. One of the strengths of New York this season has been its front, which is headlined by Brian Burns (13 sacks). With reserves set to man Drake Maye's blindside, there's an opportunity for Burns, Abdul Carter, and others to tee off and throw the Patriots offense off the track. If they can do that, it'll help Jaxson Dart stay within the spread in his return to action.Projected score: Patriots 24, Giants 20The pick: Giants +7Rest of the bunchJaguars at TitansProjected score: Jaguars 27, Titans 17The pick: Jaguars -6Saints at DolphinsProjected score: Dolphins 28, Saints 20The pick: Dolphins -5.5Falcons at JetsProjected score: Falcons 24, Jets 17The pick: Falcons -2.5Cardinals at BuccaneersProjected score: Cardinals 24, Buccaneers 21The pick: Cardinals +3.5\nRams at PanthersProjected score: Rams 30, Panthers 17The pick: Rams -10Vikings at SeahawksProjected score: Seahawks 27, Vikings 14The pick: Seahawks -11.5Bills at SteelersProjected score: Bills 30, Steelers 21The pick: Bills -3Broncos at CommandersProjected score: Broncos 27, Commanders 20The pick: Broncos -5.5\n            ",

    "body": "\n        One of WWE's signature events is back with some of the biggest stars imaginable. WWE Survivor Series goes down on Saturday night in San Diego with the imaginative format taking center stage once again in WarGames. There will be two WarGames matches taking place at Petco Park -- the fourth straight year the stipulation has been used -- in the men's and women's divisions, and will have names like Roman Reigns, Brock Lesnar, Cody Rhodes, CM Punk, AJ Lee, Rhea Ripley and Charlotte Flair in action.The teams could provide some interesting drama, both internally and externally. Reigns, Rhodes and Punk have their own storyline developing as Reigns has his eyes on getting back in the world title scene while being joined by his cousins, The Usos, to form the five-man team. Meanwhile, Paul Heyman has assembled a powerhouse unit, headlined by Lesnar, who is joined by Drew McIntyre, Logan Paul, Bron Breakker and Bronson Reed.On the women's side, Lee, Ripley, Flair, Alexa Bliss and Iyo Sky will have their hands full with Nia Jax Lash Legend Asuka, Kairi Sane and Lynch.\nSurvivor Series also features the penultimate stop in John Cena's retirement tour. The new intercontinental champion wrestles his last pay-per-view match, granting Dominik Mysterio a rematch before turning his attention to the winner of The Last Time is Now tournament.Plus, women's world champion Stephanie Vaquer has quite the challenge on her hands when she takes on former friend Nikki Bella with the title on the line. Bella turned her back on Vaquer after beginning to mentor the wrestler in her first year up from NXT. Now, the Hall of Famer has gold on her mind in her first world title match in nearly a decade.Take a look below at the confirmed matches for Survivor Series and take a glance at the crystal ball of what may come. The event streams live on ESPN Unlimited starting at 7 p.m. ET.\n2025 WWE Survivor Series matchesCM Punk, Cody Rhodes, The Usos (Jey Uso & Jimmy Uso) and Roman Reigns vs. The Vision (Bron Breakker, Bronson Reed & Logan Paul), Drew McIntyre and Brock Lesnar (WarGames match): Survivor Series' main event must have taken a turn after Seth Rollins suffered an injury at Crown Jewel. The Vision now moves on without him, forming an alliance with Logan Paul in the process. On Nov. 14, McIntyre joined The Vision's team to circumvent a suspension handed to him by SmackDown general manager Nick Aldis. The final spots on each team were claimed by Lesnar, siding with Heyman's group, and Reigns reuniting with his cousins. On the last Raw before Survivor Series, McIntyre and Paul won a match, earning their team the advantage.Rhea Ripley, Iyo Sky, Alexa Bliss, Charlotte Flair and AJ Lee vs. Nia Jax, Lash Legend, The Kabuki Warriors (Asuka & Kairi Sane) and Becky Lynch: Multiple rivalries come to a head in this year's women's WarGames match. Ripley and Sky have been feuding with the Kabuki Warriors. WWE women's tag team champions Bliss and Flair have sparked up a fresh rivalry with the new tandem of Jax and Lash. After the match was booked, Flair exited her team, claiming she couldn't trust Ripley. That leaves two spots to fill on Ripley's team, and one for Jax's. Flair and Ripley eventually patched things up, bolstering their ranks with Lee, while Jax and company enlisted Lynch. On the final SmackDown before Survivor Series, Flair defeated Asuka to win her team the advantage.Intercontinental Championship -- John Cena (c) vs. Dominik Mysterio: Cena is a first-ballot Hall of Famer, and the first 17-time world champion recognized by WWE, but until recently, he was not a Grand Slam champion. That's because the intercontinental title has surprisingly eluded him for two decades. On Nov. 10, Cena defeated Mysterio in an impromptu match for the intercontinental title. They will have their rematch at Survivor Series.\nWomen's World Championship -- Stephanie Vaquer (c) vs. Nikki Bella: Bella is going nowhere. Three months after a failed bid for the women's intercontinental title, Bella struck Vaquer from behind. Her villainous turn sets the stage for Vaquer's next title defense at a cornerstone WWE pay-per-view.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Lionel Messi and Inter Miami are one win away from the first MLS Cup appearance in their history, and at 38, the Argentine shows no signs of slowing down. The Herons will host New York City FC in the Eastern Conference final at Chase Stadium on Saturday as they look to secure a trophy to end their season on a strong note. Adjustments by Javier Mascherano have the team riding a shutout streak of more than 200 minutes, but during these playoffs, one thing has been made clear: Miami will go as far as Messi can take them. This is obviously no surprise. Even at his age, Messi was far and away the best player in MLS this season. He led the league in goals, with 29, five more than anybody else, assists with 19 (tied with Anders Dreyer), and shots with 157. Of those goals, 28 were non-penalty goals an MLS record. He did this all while only playing in only 28 games in a 34 game regular season schedule. Messi may be 38 years old, but he remains Lionel Messi, an unstoppable force the likes of which the world, let alone MLS, has never seen.And then the playoffs started, and things got even better. How to watch Inter Miami vs. New York City FC, oddsDate: Saturday, Nov. 29 | Time: 6 p.m. ETLocation: Chase Stadium -- Fort Lauderdale, FloridaLive stream: MLS Season PassOdds: Inter Miami -210; Draw +360; NYCFC +490With 12 goal contributions during the playoffs, no player has more in MLS history, and Messi's six goals lead all members of the playoffs, and so do his six assists (including secondary assists). He's done this in just four games, but it's unheard of for one player to have been involved in every goal for their club during a playoff run. But that's just what Messi has done during his time in MLS. He has made the unheard of seem regular, and this run is no different.No team has ever won MLS Cup with one player contributing to all of their goals, so if Miami can accomplish that with Messi keeping up what he has been doing, they can make even more history during this postseason. Taylor Twellman, himself an MLS legend, contributed to every goal on the run New England Revolution made the final in 2007, but they fell to the Houston Dynamo in the MLS Cup. Also, that was a grand total of three team goals, Miami is already at 12.\nPlayers to be involved in every goal contributionMinimum four games playedSeasonPlayer TeamGoalsAssistsContributionsTeam Goals Games2025Lionel MessiInter Miami66121242018Daniel RoyerNew York Red Bulls224442007Taylor TwellmanNew England Revolution30334You can already see clear differences in how many goals Messi has been involved in compared to others on this list, and while the league MVP hasn't been announced yet, it'd be a surprise for anyone other than Messi to win the award, as he's arguably having the best season of anyone to ever come through MLS.Messi may not have a trophy to mark what he's done yet, but with Miami becoming the first MLS team to ever defeat a team from a European top-five league when they triumphed over Porto during the Club World Cup, this is a team showing what the possibilities are for MLS, and a large reason for that is Messi's impact so let's take a deeper look at some numbers that have defined the season so far.48: Goal Contributions during the MLS regular seasonWith 29 goals and 19 assists during the season, only one player has had more, and that's Carlos Vela in 2019. Vela had a whopping 49 goal contributions with 34 goals and 15 assists, being involved in more than a goal per game. Those two stand alone, and even with the league including secondary assists in their numbers, this is an astounding figure. It's worth nothing that excluding secondary assists Messi jumps ahead of Vela on the goal contribution front as 16 of Messi's 19 assists were primary assists while only 10 of Vela's 15 were. Then there's the question of penalties. Vela scored a whopping nine goals from the penalty spot, Messi scored one.\nNo one has been able to stop Messi when he's on the pitch, and even when he has to pick his spots to get forward, the Argentine's ability to float into space is unmatched. Having a player like this on the team also opens up opportunities for those around them, which should bring no surprise that Miami's 12 goal contributions during this playoff run are the most of any team.7: Consecutive matches with a goal or an assistTo have so many goal involvements, a player needs to be consistent, and of course, Messi has done just that. You ahve to go back to September 30, facing the Chicago Fire, to find he last time that Messi hasn't been involved in a goal. Since then, he has had 11 goals and 11 assists. Quite some balance, but in the 32 MLS matches that Messi has featured in this season, including the playoffs, he has only failed to register a goal contribution in five matches. Miami has also failed to win any of those matches, losing four and drawing one. So it's simple: if NYCFC stops Messi, they can win the match. Just statistics say that it'll be quite hard to do.0: Trophies this seasonWhile the Messi era has brought Miami a Supporters' Shield and Leagues Cup trophy, this is one number that the Herons are trying to change, and New York City FC will stand in their way of doing that. NYCFC is the only team remaining in the playoffs that have won the MLS Cup before, but that doesn't mean Miami won't have enough experience to get them through the match in front of their home fans. Looking to not only send Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets into retirement on a high note but also close out Chase Stadium with a trophy, all of the pressure will be on the Herons to get the job done. \nThat's part of why the playoffs have had a different intensity for them. Last season's first round exit to Atlanta United is firmly in the past, but this season also isn't a successful one without a trophy. Just having Messi in the side raises expectations for Inter Miami above what has ever been expected from any MLS side, and they can reach those but not winning MLS Cup will only bring more questions to the side.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 Big Ten Championship Game matchup is set, and it's a battle between the two teams who have seemed destined for this meeting for months: Ohio State and Indiana. They have been the two best teams in the league all season, as well as the two best teams in the country, according to every major poll. This year's game is a historic matchup as well. It's the first time in Big Ten Championship Game history both participants will enter the game undefeated. Both Ohio State and Indiana will enter the game with a 12-0 record, and the winner will not only be Big Ten champion but also the No. 1 seed in the College Football Playoff.Things won't be terrible for the loser, either. While they won't get to call themselves Big Ten champions, they'll also likely receive a first-round bye in the College Football Playoff. That's what happens when you're two of the best teams in the country.So, not only is this a conference title game, but it could be the first of two meetings between these teams this season.\n\n    \n                                        \n    What to know about Ohio StateThis has been one of the most impressive coaching jobs in college football history by Ryan Day. Ohio State won the national title last season, lost nearly all the significant contributors from that team, as well as both its offensive and defensive coordinators. And all the Buckeyes have done is run through the regular season undefeated, dominating opponents along the way.Last year, the Buckeyes' offense was led by a veteran transfer at QB in Will Howard. This season, it's been a redshirt freshman Julian Sayin, who was quickly thrown into the fire by having to face Texas in his first career start. As expected, Sayin got off to a slow start but has proven to be one of the best players in the country this season, and he could be on his way to New York as a Heisman Trophy finalist. He may even win the award depending on how things go in this game.He may not be Ohio State's lone Heisman finalist. The man Sayin has thrown to more often than any other, Jeremiah Smith, could be on his way as well. Smith was one of the best receivers in the country as a freshman last year, and nothing has changed in his sophomore season.\nStill, while the offense remains one of the most dangerous in the country, it may be the Ohio State defense that truly separates them from the rest of the country. There is no other word to describe the unit other than elite. Only four teams have managed to score double-digits against the Buckeyes, and none scored more than 16.Whether it's players like Caden Curry and Kayden McDonald up front, Sonny Styles and Arvell Reese at linebacker or Caleb Downs and Lorenzo Styles in the secondary, there is incredible talent at every single level. Defensive coordinator Matt Patricia has used every player at his disposal to create a puzzle that no offense has been able to solve.\n    \n                                        \n    What to know about IndianaNobody was quite sure what to make of the Hoosiers entering the 2025 season. We were all still a bit stunned by what the team pulled off in 2024, but would they be able to pull off the encore? After all, they lost a few key players from that team and were rebuilding through the transfer portal again.\nPlus, the schedule got a lot tougher.And none of it mattered. Not only did Indiana continue the success it had in 2024, but it also improved upon it. Those big games the Hoosiers couldn't win last year? They won them this year. They went on the road and beat Oregon at Autzen Stadium. After listening to the college football world spend the entire offseason describing Illinois as \"this year's Indiana,\" Indiana beat the Illini by a resounding 53 points. These Hoosiers can no longer be described as a bully beating up on inferior competition: they beat up on everybody all the same.While coach Curt Cignetti deserves a lot of the credit for changing the culture of the program, the talent infusion helped, too. The transfer class along the offensive line has been a grand slam for the program, as the team is much stronger along the lines of scrimmage than last season, but the biggest difference is the new quarterback.Fernando Mendoza might be your Heisman Trophy winner. He may also be the No. 1 pick in the NFL Draft next spring. For now, he's the guy leading the Indiana Hoosiers to their first 12-0 record in program history, and possibly their first Big Ten title since 1967, and first outright conference title since 1945. It's been a while!\nHe doesn't do it alone, though. While they may not be household names, players like Aiden Fisher, D'Angelo Ponds, Stephen Daley, and Isaiah Jones lead one of the most fearsome defenses in the country. Ohio State vs. Indiana predictionI wish I could tell you I have a clear read on this game, but I don't. While these two met last season, they were both very different teams, and Indiana has upgraded its roster since. Both have explosive offenses led by their quarterbacks and excellent receivers. Both have strong front sevens on defense that do an excellent job stopping the run and putting pressure on opposing quarterbacks. There really isn't a whole lot to separate these teams, but if you can fall back on anything in this sport, it's talent. Indiana has a lot of talented players. Ohio State is an entire roster full of future NFL players. That, and the fact the Buckeyes have been in big spots like this before, and won, might prove to be the edge in what will be a close game. Prediction: Ohio State win Big Ten championship\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Lane Kiffin had one final message for Ole Miss on the way out the door: You're just not good enough. Don't confuse his desire to coach in the College Football Playoff with actual remorse. By choosing to leave Ole Miss for fellow SEC foe LSU, as Yahoo reported he intends to do, Kiffin is saying with his entire chest that he can't win a national championship in Oxford, Mississippi. This is despite the Rebels being a lock for the CFP at 11-1 overall during what is by far Kiffin's best season as a head coach.  \n        \n            \n                Latest on Jon Sumrall and Florida, Lane Kiffin and other coaching search news\n                \n                    Matt Zenitz                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSomeone who rejects a program so openly doesn't deserve a chance to coach that team in the playoff. It shouldn't even be a discussion.If Kiffin wants to take LSU, he should move to Baton Rouge immediately.  Let one of the Rebels remaining coaches -- be it a Pete Golding or a Joe Judge -- lead the playoff charge. Teams feed off belief. If Kiffin actually wants to coach in the playoff, he has an easy option to do so. He could stay with Ole Miss. It's unreasonable to expect Ole Miss would let him finish out the season and then leave for competitor, especially in an era where so many of his players could go with him. \nFrankly, all of this is an ironic calculus by Kiffin given Oxford is where he experienced a career rebirth. Remember, for all Kiffin's recent success and his soon-to-be record-setting pay bump, his history as a coach is littered with failure. He escaped in the middle of the night in Knoxville after just one 7-6 season. He got fired on a tarmac as USC's head coach. Nick Saban even fired Kiffin ahead of a national championship game when Kiffin couldn't juggle his offensive coordinator duties with his next role as FAU's head coach. Other than a few seasons in Boca Raton, Oxford is the only place where Kiffin's had any real extended success on the big stage as a decision maker. \nIn Mississippi, Kiffin found a program that embraced his eccentric nature. Athletic director Keith Carter gave Kiffin all the leeway possible to run the Rebels as he saw fit. Ole Miss' collective emerged as an industry leader in the NIL era, allowing the Rebels to consistently reel in top portal classes Does Ole Miss have the recruiting firepower of a LSU, Alabama or Georgia? Obviously not. The history of Rebels football isn't there. The high-end money of a program like Oregon or Miami isn't either. There's a reason why the Rebels usually sign top 20 classes instead of top 10. But it's not as if Kiffin's ever been a superstar recruiter. He's a showy one. He wins on social media. But those who've worked with Kiffin wouldn't describe him as a recruiting maniac like his mentor Saban or his friend Kirby Smart. \nYou can get away with that at Ole Miss. The fans there were thrilled with Kiffin's portal-first approach. It will be much more difficult in Baton Rouge where elite classes are expected and every recruiting battle is a live-or-die moment for the Tigers community. That's the most confusing thing about Kiffin flirting with LSU and Florida so openly. \nYou could argue he already found his football soul mate. There's a reason Kirk Fertenz is in Year 27 at Iowa or that Steve Spurrier had so much success in 12 years at Florida. They were (are) great football coaches, yes. But their personality and style fit their school. Kiffin and Ole Miss seemed to be an ideal match. Nobody embraced Kiffin more than the Rebels faithful. And you know how he repaid that? With a wandering eye toward Auburn way back in 2022 and then Florida and LSU this time around. Those who've worked for Kiffin have expected him to chase a bigger SEC job for years. So, I'd just ask: Why doesn't Kiffin believe more in himself? The Rebels are just four games away from the ultimate goal in college football. Kiffin's already managed four double-digit win seasons in his last five years in Oxford. It's taken LSU 13 years to have that many double-digit win efforts. \nKiffin didn't have to leave Oxford to chase what he's looking for. That's why the thought of Kiffin getting to coach the Rebels in the playoff is so absurd.Why would Ole Miss, a program on the verge of history, let someone who's showed so little faith in the program keep leading it? \n            ",

Live by it.Ryan Helsley signs with OriolesWhile some teams were reportedly eyeing Helsley as a rotation candidate, the Orioles plan to use him as a closer with Felix Bautista (shoulder) expected out for the majority of 2016. Helsley was a great closer not so long ago, registering 49 saves with a 2.04 ERA in 2024, but he was not so great or even a closer when last we saw him, putting together a 7.20 ERA in 22 appearances for the Mets following a midseason trade from the Cardinals.\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        NYM\n                    \n                         \n                        N.Y.

It's not the sort of contract that an ace reliever who's entirely worry-free would get, but it's a robust commitment nonetheless. With the Orioles expected back in playoff contention, you should anticipate drafting Helsley in the 12-15 range at relief pitcher. He's has the potential to be top five. --Scott White\n Dylan Cease signs with Blue Jays \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        SD\n                    \n                         \n                        San Diego\n                    \n                                            • #84\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 29\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INN\n                                    \n                                    168\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        W\n                                    \n                                    8\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        K's\n                                    \n                                    215\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        ERA\n                                    \n                                    4.55\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        WHIP\n                                    \n                                    1.33\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n$210 million is a lot of money for a pitcher coming off a 4.55 ERA. But as I wrote in my more in-depth breakdown of the signing, that ERA doesn't come close to telling the whole story with Cease. Yes, he's frustratingly inconsistent. He's also a true workhorse, taking the ball every fifth day and providing volume and strikeouts. With ERA and WHIP risk, sure, but there's obviously plenty of upside there, too. He's going off the board in early drafts around 80th overall, as the 20th SP off the board or thereabouts, and that seems like a perfect fine value for a guy with his mixture of upside and projectable volume. There aren't many pitchers whose absolute best-case scenario is as enticing for Fantasy as Cease's. --Chris Towers    Sonny Gray traded to Red Sox    \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        BOS\n                    \n                         \n                        Boston\n                    \n                                            • #54\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 36\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INN\n                                    \n                                    180.2\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        W\n                                    \n                                    14\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        K's\n                                    \n                                    201\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        ERA\n                                    \n                                    4.28\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        WHIP\n                                    \n                                    1.23\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nThe Red Sox have been expected to make a big splash in either free agency or in the trade market for a rotation upgrade, and this trade might be it. Gray struggled to a 4.28 ERA and 1.23 WHIP last season, but his underlying metrics were more indicative of a top-of-rotation arm, including a 26.7% strikeout rate, 3.39 FIP and 3.29 SIERA. The 36-year-old has seen his velocity decline in consecutive seasons, however, and his quality of contact metrics took a big step back in 2025, which is why his xERA was a more pedestrian 3.90 mark. He's a solid pitcher, both for the Red Sox and for Fantasy, but I don't think he's a needle-mover in either instance at this point in his career, even if the Red Sox might be able to get him in their pitching lab and squeeze some extra value out of him. There's still room for the Red Sox to upgrade this rotation, in other words. --Chris Towers    Richard Fitts and Brandon Clarke traded to Cardinals   In exchange for Gray, the Cardinals got a couple of interesting younger arms. Fitts is more of a known quantity, and he hasn't given us much reason to be excited. He had a 5.00 ERA with even worse peripherals in 2025, so while he might slide into the Cardinals rotation, it'll mostly be for a lack of better options.  Clarke is the more interesting long-term project, with a fastball that can touch 100 mph and a slider that is already a weapon. The rest of the arsenal is a work in progress. He walked 27 in just 38 innings across two levels of A-Ball in 2025, so this is a real project. If all comes together, he might be able to hack it as a starter, but he looks more like a Ryan Helsley-in-waiting type of high-leverage bullpen arm in the long run.   \nThe other thing worth noting here is that, with Gray out of the picture and Miles Mikolas leaving via free agency, there are multiple holes in the Cardinals rotation right now. Prospects Quinn Mathews and Tink Hence have experience in the high minors and could be options for the 2026 rotation, though both have troublesome 2025 campaigns that could lead the team to want to see more success at Triple-A before they make that call. For Fantasy, those are both names to know heading into spring training in case they can steal rotation spots. Liam Doyle, a 2025 first-round pick, seems likely to be more of a midseason consideration after he threw just 3 2/3 post-draft innings in the pros, but he could absolutely be a fast riser early in 2026, too. --Chris Towers     Marcus Semien traded for Brandon Nimmo    \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        TEX\n                    \n                         \n                        Texas\n                    \n                                            • #9\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 32\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AVG\n                                    \n                                    .262\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        HR\n                                    \n                                    25\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RBI\n                                    \n                                    92\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        R\n                                    \n                                    81\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SB\n                                    \n                                    13\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        OPS\n                                    \n                                    .760\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nThe Mets and Rangers continued the early offseason trend of trading major leaguers for other major leaguers in an exchange of two aging ones with multiple years remaining on their deals. Nimmo, who's 32, has shown only faint signs of decline, if even those, continuing to make worthwhile contributions in home runs and stolen bases with big run and RBI production. He's joining a worse lineup that plays in a worse venue, but any changes to his production would be slight, presuming good health.    \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        NYM\n                    \n                         \n                        N.Y.

That's my biggest takeaway from this trade, but Chris Towers has written a complete breakdown of it, which you can find here. --Scott White    \n    \tRaisel Iglesias signs with Braves    \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        ATL\n                    \n                         \n                        Atlanta\n                    \n                                            • #26\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 35\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SV\n                                    \n                                    29\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        ERA\n                                    \n                                    3.21\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        WHIP\n                                    \n                                    1.00\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INN\n                                    \n                                    67.1\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        BB\n                                    \n                                    16\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        K\n                                    \n                                    73\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nIglesias re-ups for one year at exactly the same rate ($16 million) as the previous three. Clearly, the Braves were looking for continuity, and that makes the analysis here rather easy. He's the closer again for an expected contender and a near lock for 30 saves, provided he stays healthy. He missed that number by one in 2025, mostly because of some early-season struggles. Once he cut back on his slider, though, he was clearly back to form, compiling a 1.25 ERA, 0.69 WHIP and 10.0 K/9 in his final 45 appearances. That'll play, all right, and positions Iglesias to be one of the first 12 relievers off the board in 2026. --Scott White         \tGrayson Rodriguez traded for Taylor Ward     \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        BAL\n                    \n                         \n                        Baltimore\n                    \n                                            • #3\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 31\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AVG\n                                    \n                                    .228\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        HR\n                                    \n                                    36\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RBI\n                                    \n                                    103\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        R\n                                    \n                                    86\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        OPS\n                                    \n                                    .792\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AB\n                                    \n                                    579\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nWhat a fall for Rodriguez, who was regarded a couple years ago as one of the game's burgeoning aces after a multi-year run as a top-10 overall prospect. Now, the Orioles have dealt him away for one year of some 32-year-old outfielder who just hit .228. That's not entirely fair to Ward, who also connected for 36 home runs in 2025, but most projections have him regressing to 25-30 in 2026. He's also joining a team that's loaded with solid-but-less-than-All-Star-worthy corner bats. There already wasn't room in the lineup for all of Dylan Beavers, Samuel Basallo, Coby Mayo, Tyler O'Neill and Ryan Mountcastle. Now, there's room for one fewer. It won't be Ward, but does that mean we'll have to wait even longer for Basallo to contribute in Fantasy? If so, that's a bummer.     \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        LAA\n                    \n                         \n                        L.A.

The lat has been a recurring problem, also costing Rodriguez time in 2024 and as a minor leaguer in 2022, and the elbow required debridement surgery in August. The Orioles only made this deal because they couldn't trust him to stay healthy, but having said that, he wouldn't be the first pitcher to overcome a multi-year injury trend and still go on to meet his potential. We have no evidence that his stuff has diminished with this latest rash of injuries, so I'm still inclined to rank him as a top 75 starting pitcher for 2026. This trade is sure to give some drafters pause even at that late stage, though.  --Scott White     \n     \tTrent Grisham signs with Yankees     Grisham's decision to accept the qualifying offer is a curious one given that he just had far and away his best season, homering 34 times as the primary center fielder for the Yankees. Some major outlets were projecting him to receive a four- or five-year deal for a similar annual value as the qualifying offer, but his agent probably has a better read on the market.     \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        NYY\n                    \n                         \n                        N.Y.

You might think the return to Yankee Stadium will help, given that he's a left-handed batter, but he actually hit two-thirds of his home runs on the road. If the Yankees are serious about giving Jasson Dominguez regular playing time next year and also bringing back Cody Bellinger, Grisham may be fighting for at-bats again. The Yankees still make for a better landing than a lot of clubs, but you can understand why drafters might approach Grisham with some skepticism in 2026. --Scott White          \tGleyber Torres signs with Tigers     \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        DET\n                    \n                         \n                        Detroit\n                    \n                                            • #25\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 28\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AVG\n                                    \n                                    .256\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        HR\n                                    \n                                    16\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RBI\n                                    \n                                    74\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        R\n                                    \n                                    79\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        OPS\n                                    \n                                    .745\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AB\n                                    \n                                    532\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nA modest showing by Torres in 2025 led him to accept the Tigers' qualifying offer rather than testing the free agent market, and you might think a return to Comerica Park is a bad move for his Fantasy value given its reputation. But it actually played well for right-handed hitters in 2025, and Torres batted .285 with a .449 slugging percentage there compared to .223 and .327 on the road. On balance, he performed well below his .271 xBA and .452 xSLG, having delivered his best average exit velocity in three years and some of his best walk and strikeout numbers ever, so some better luck would go a long way toward redeeming him in Fantasy. He's not a surefire top-12 choice, though, even at a position as thin as second base. --Scott White     \n     \tBrandon Woodruff signs with Brewers     \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        MIL\n                    \n                         \n                        Milwaukee\n                    \n                                            • #53\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 32\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        W-L\n                                    \n                                    7-2\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        ERA\n                                    \n                                    3.20\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        WHIP\n                                    \n                                    0.91\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INN\n                                    \n                                    64.2\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        BB\n                                    \n                                    14\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        K\n                                    \n                                    83\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nSomething tells me that if Woodruff hadn't gone into the offseason nursing a lat injury, he wouldn't have had to accept the Brewers' qualifying offer, instead pursuing a multi-year deal. But now, he's back in prove-it mode after already overcoming a more significant shoulder injury in near miraculous fashion. Even though the shoulder capsule surgery that he underwent in 2023 took 3 mph off his fastball -- normally a career-ender for a pitcher, particularly one so fastball-reliant -- he basically picked up where he left off statistically, even delivering the best strikeout rate of his career. A new cutter is largely to credit for saving him, and his fortunes rose and fell with its usage. He'll be plenty motivated now that he's pitching for a contract again, but he would have been worth selecting among the top 36 starting pitchers either way.  --Scott White           \tShota Imanaga signs with Cubs      The Cubs' decision to decline Imanaga's three-year, $57.5 million option after the season makes more sense now that we see the way everything played out. They probably suspected he'd accept the $22.025 million qualifying offer, which he did, so now they still have him but without the multi-year commitment.     \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        CHC\n                    \n                         \n                        Chi.

It's sort of misleading to call it his sophomore season given that he's 32, and his age contributed to those fears of decline as well. Still, he was effective when healthy, remaining a standout for WHIP in particular. No one will mistake him for an ace in 2026, but he should be drafted in the middle rounds. --Scott White             \n     \tJosh Naylor signs with Mariners     Normally, a hitter signing with the Mariners wouldn't be the most favorable outcome given T-Mobile Park's reputation as a pitcher-friendly venue.

His 11 stolen bases in 93 games with the Diamondbacks were surprising enough, but then he had 19 in just 54 games with the Mariners. Given his 3rd percentile sprint speed, some other team might have put a stop to that, but the Mariners don't seem to care. He was succeeding, after all. It's doubtful he steals 30 again, which is why he remains only eighth in my first base rankings, but a return to the Mariners improves Naylor's chances of remaining a base-stealer in some capacity.

    "body": "\n        We're still on Thanksgiving weekend, so it figures to remain a slow period of the Major League Baseball offseason before things, hopefully, start to pick up sometime next week. Still, there's been a notable move along with a few rumors, so let's round everything up. Orioles get their closerThe Orioles were looking for a closer this offseason and they appear to have landed their man. They are in agreement with right-hander Ryan Helsley on a two-year deal for $28 million, per The Athletic. There had been talk that Helsley might convert to a starter for next season, but the report indicates Helsley is now slotted as the closer for the Orioles.\nHelsley, 31, was one of the best closers in baseball in 2024 and was still productive in the role with the Cardinals before being traded to the Mets this past season. In 22 appearances for the Mets, however, he pitched to a 7.20 ERA and 1.80 WHIP. It's entirely possible that was just a small, fluky stretch. In 2024, he had a 2.04 ERA and 1.10 WHIP with 79 strikeouts in 66 ⅓ innings, closing down an MLB-best 49 saves in 53 chances.Phillies expected to retain SchwarberThe \"feeling here is that [Kyle] Schwarber will remain in Philadelphia,\" said MLB.com earlier this week. The report indicates that the Phillies have \"prioritized\" keeping Schwarber and free agent catcher J.T. Realmuto, though nothing as of this writing is close to being done. \nThe 32-year-old DH hit .240/.365/.563 (150 OPS+) with 56 home runs, 132 RBI, 111 runs and 4.7 WAR in 162 games last season. He finished second in NL MVP voting behind Shohei Ohtani. Jays still looking for reliefThe Blue Jays landed free agent starting pitcher Dylan Cease earlier this week and remain in contact with All-Star free agent Bo Bichette. They're also in on relievers, according to SportsNet, looking for at least one late-inning pitcher. The report notes that the Jays were in on Phil Maton before the Cubs signed him and \"monitored\" Raisel Iglesias. \nAs things stand, the defending AL champs have Jeff Hoffman at closer with Yimi García, Louis Varland and Brayden Fisher setting up. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 Big 12 Championship Game is set as No. 5 Texas Tech and No. 11 BYU will battle at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, on Saturday morning. The Cougars and Red Raiders have lorded above the rest of the league all season and formally clinched the matchup after Arizona State lost to Arizona on Friday night. Last year, four different teams tied at 7-2 in conference play. This year, there was no such concern. The Red Raiders and Cougars stood above the rest of the Big 12 for most of the 2025 season and previously played a top 10 matchup in Lubbock in November. The game will be highly significant as both BYU and Texas Tech try to make a College Football Playoff case. The Red Raiders are locks for the field and could push for a bye, but BYU sits on the outside looking in heading into the battle. They could need the Big 12's auto-bid just to reach the postseason. Here's everything you need to know about the 2025 Big 12 Championship Game. \n    \n                                        \n    What to know about Texas TechThe Red Raiders have been one of the best stories of the college football season after making a significant transfer portal investment over the offseason. Despite replacing both coordinators over the offseason, the Red Raiders lead the Big 12 in every major statistical category, including total offense, total defense, scoring offense and scoring defense. \nAfter destroying UCF 48-9 last week, the Red Raiders captured their first 10-win season since 2008, the historic Michael Crabtree campaign. All 10 wins have come by double-digits, making for one of the most dominant runs in Big 12 history. The only loss came when starting quarterback Behren Morton was sidelined. With Morton banged up, Texas Tech has leaned heavily on running back Cameron Dickey to great success. The sophomore is No. 2 in the conference with 944 yards and leads the league with 13 touchdowns entering Week 14. However, the defense is the star of the show, rating top-five nationally in most analytic metrics. The Red Raiders are the only team with multiple finalists for the Nagurski Award, as linebacker Jacob Rodriguez and edge rusher David Bailey push for All-America honors. Texas Tech has not won an outright conference championship since 1955 or played for a Big 12 title since the league was formed in 1996. Generational curses could come to an end in Arlington. \n\n    \n                                        \n    What to know about BYUThe Cougars are one of the top teams in college football over the past two years, posting a 21-3 combined record heading into Week 14. The only multi-score loss came against the Red Raiders on Nov. 8 in a marquee matchup, a 29-7 decision in Lubbock. After losing incumbent starting quarterback Jake Retzlaff to transfer, the Cougars turned to true freshman Bear Bachmeier. Despite only joining for the fall, Bachmeier has been one of the most effective quarterbacks in the Big 12. The Murrieta, California, native has thrown for 2,304 yards, rushed for 525 yards and scored 24 total touchdowns entering the weekend. But for BYU, defense and running take the spotlight. The Cougars rank near the top in most defensive metrics as linebackers Jack Kelly and Isaiah Glasker lead the way. Safety Faletau Satuala has been a breakout star, while running back LJ Martin leads the Big 12 in rushing yards. \nThe Cougars become the first team from the Big 12's first expansion in 2023 to reach the Big 12 Championship Game and second overall behind Arizona State. BYU has not won a conference championship since leaving the Mountain West Conference for independence in 2011. Texas Tech vs. BYU predictionWhen these two teams played in Lubbock, Texas Tech's defense dominated the matchup. Linebacker Jacob Rodriguez had a key interception and forced fumble in the game as BYU's offense was held off the scoreboard until the fourth quarter. BYU offensive coordinator Aaron Roderick will open up the downfield playbook with his freshman quarterback to try and spread the defense, which will create opportunities. However, Texas Tech is playing at an unbelievably high level right now, and won't waste its crowning moment. Prediction: Texas Tech wins Big 12 championship\n            ",

Aryna Sabalenka has won multiple Australian Open women's titles and has appeared in three straight finals, so she headlines the Australian Open women's draw. Sinner is the -115 favorite on the men's side, while Sabalenka is the +200 favorite on the women's side, per the latest Australian Open odds. SportsLine expert Jose Onorato has locked in his best bets for both draws, featuring a pair of longshots.  Before locking in your Australian Open picks for the first Grand Slam of the season, be sure to check out the top tennis betting picks from Onorato.New users can target the all-new DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Onorato has gone 168-106-8 (+107.12 units) on his best bets since 2022.

He currently ranks among the tour's best in both service games held and return games won on outdoor hard. His win rate against top-10 opponents on the surface is outstanding, and his tiebreak record highlights how well his game holds up in pressure moments. If he's fully healthy, there's no better anchor at the top of the board.\"New users can get a first bet matched up to $250 with the latest Caesars promo code. You can claim the offer here: Carlos Alcaraz (+180)\"While Alcaraz has yet to win in Melbourne, he's already claimed Slam titles on every other surface and remains one of the most complete threats in the game,\" Onorato said. \"His hard-court metrics remain elite, with a win rate above 75 percent over the past two years and one of the highest return points won percentages against second serves. He's beaten nearly every top seed in both best-of-three and best-of-five conditions and has the physicality and resilience to handle the tough back end of a Slam. If anyone is going to stop Sinner, this is the most logical challenger.\"New users can target the all-new DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: Alex De Minaur (+7000)\"The home crowd will be behind him, but it's not just narrative. De Minaur has quietly put together a strong stretch on outdoor hard, improving his serve and finishing more points early in rallies,\" Onorato said. \"His physical conditioning is elite, and he's become more willing to step into the court and dictate when given time. He's posted quality wins over top-10 players in recent months, and his rally tolerance and court speed make him well-suited for long matches in the Australian heat. If the draw breaks his way, he could be the unexpected name in the semifinals.\"New users can get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 bet with the latest FanDuel promo code.

She's won multiple Australian Open titles and has reached the final three years in a row,\" Onorato said. \"Her power game thrives in quick conditions, and her ability to win short rallies makes her perfectly suited to this surface. Statistically, she ranks near the top of the WTA in first-serve points won, ace rate, and short-rally points (0–4 shots). If she serves well, there are very few women who can stay with her for three sets. She should be considered the top contender again in 2026.\"New users can get a first bet matched up to $250 with the latest Caesars promo code. You can claim the offer here:Iga Świątek (+550)\"Swiatek has yet to lift the trophy in Australia but remains one of the most reliable all-surface performers on the WTA. Her return game is unmatched, consistently ranking among the top two or three in return games won. She also tends to dispatch lower-ranked opponents in straight sets, which helps manage physical load across the two weeks,\" Onorato said. \"While she hasn't looked quite as comfortable on hard as she does on clay, her numbers on the surface remain elite. If her serve holds up, she's just as dangerous as Sabalenka over the course of a Slam.\"With the latest BetMGM bonus code, new users can get up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses. Claim the offer here: Mirra Andreeva (+1700)\"At just 18 years old, Andreeva already has a Slam semifinal under her belt and the tactical maturity of a veteran. Her ability to vary pace, absorb power, and construct points gives her a real shot on hard courts,\" Onorato said. \"She's posted wins over multiple top-10 players, and her game holds up under pressure. Her return positioning and ability to redirect pace make her particularly tough in fast conditions. If she handles the early rounds cleanly, her all-court game could carry her into the second week once again.\"New users can get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 bet with the latest FanDuel promo code.

These two teams haven't met since, though, and now the Thunder travel to Houston, where the Rockets are 12-2 this season. Only the Rockets and Thunder have just two home losses this season. The Thunder have the best record in the NBA at 34-7, but they haven't been as dominant in recent weeks, going 10-6 since Dec. 13. The Rockets returned home from a 0-3 road trip with a 119-113 win over the Bulls on Tuesday, and Houston has won seven straight at home. The Rockets (23-14) have only been the underdog three times this season, winning two of those three games straight up. The model projects Houston to win in 59% of simulations, showcasing strong value as a plus-money underdog. Back the Rockets at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Mavericks (-112) to defeat the JazzThe Mavericks play the second half of a back-to-back on Thursday, and Wednesday was a tough night for Dallas' health. Both Cooper Flagg and Daniel Gafford left early with ankle injuries, and the Mavericks are already playing without Anthony Davis (finger) and Dereck Lively II (foot). However, the Jazz, who are also playing the second half of a back-to-back, could be without key pieces, including leading scorer Lauri Markkanen, who missed Wednesday with an illness. Neither team is having a great season, with Dallas at 15-26 and the Jazz at 14-26, but the Mavericks are home, where they are 11-11 this year. Meanwhile, Utah is 5-14 on the road, and the Jazz are 2-7 over their last nine games.

Meanwhile, though it's still early in conference play, Pat Skerry's Tigers probably rate as the disappointment of the CAA, at 1-4 in loop action and only 9-9 overall from what was regarded as a league favorite. Perhaps too much is being asked of top scorer guard Tyler Tejada, whose efforts have become inconsistent.\" Back Charleston at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:\nWant more NBA, college basketball picks for Thursday?You've seen some of the model's Thursday best bets.

The fight, originally scrapped from UFC 303 in June 2024, has been floated by fans as a potential addition to the UFC's planned event at the White House this summer. UFC matchmakers will soon begin working on the White House card, tentatively planned to coincide with President Trump's birthday on June 14. On Thursday, White told Complex he wouldn't book McGregor vs. Chandler for the White House.\"No,\" White said. \"I mean, that was a couple of years ago.\" White's statement shouldn't alarm fans hoping to see McGregor at the White House. Previously, White placed \"a billion to one odds\" that former two-division champion Jon Jones would be booked for the card. By contrast, White is keeping an open mind about a McGregor comeback.\n\"We'll see if Conor's going to come back or not,\" White said. \"We've  been talking about it for a while. We'll see. We'll see how it plays  out. I don't know, though.\" McGregor has campaigned hard to compete at the White House. He officially rejoined the UFC's drug testing pool in August, a prerequisite for competition. McGregor, a former two-division champion and the sport's biggest star, has not competed in professional mixed martial arts since July 2021. His previously scheduled fight with Chandler, which was meant to headline UFC International Fight Week in 2024, was canceled after McGregor pulled out with an injured toe. \nWith Chandler out of the way, the prevailing fan theory is a trilogy fight with Nate Diaz. McGregor and Diaz are split in their series, which took place 10 years ago. Diaz is not currently signed to the UFC.\n            \n    ",

    "description": "\n        Thursday marks the open of MLB's 2026 international signing period,  one   of two ways major-league teams acquire amateur talent each year.  ",
    "body": "\n        Thursday marks the open of MLB's 2026 international signing period,  one   of two ways major-league teams acquire amateur talent each year.  The annual July draft covers players born in   the United States,   Canada,  and Puerto Rico. Players from everywhere else in the world fall   into   international free agency.              Roughly 30% of current MLB players originally signed as international amateur free agents. That group includes superstars like Ronald Acuña Jr., Vladimir Guerrero Jr., and José Ramírez. Perennial contenders like the Dodgers and Yankees, teams that typically pick late in the draft, use international free agency to add high-end prospects to their farm system.   Future    All-Stars   will sign during the international free agency  window.  Maybe  even a future Cy  Young winner or MVP. A player who signs Thursday could even one day find himself in Cooperstown. Here's   everything  you  need to know going into the open of  the 2026 international signing   period.      Format   International free agency remains free agency because MLB and the MLB    Players Association did not agree to an international draft during  collective bargaining agreement talks in 2022. MLB  has pushed for an  international draft for decades, but the union has   resisted because it would strip players of  the freedom to pick their   team, not to mention limit their earning  potential. The collective bargaining agreement expires in December. Expect MLB to once again push for an international draft during labor talks.   \nThe international signing period used to run from July 2 to June 25,   but the start of the 2020-21 signing period was pushed back  to Jan. 15   because of the COVID-19 pandemic and that change was later made permanent. The  signing  period is now neatly confined  to a single calendar year, running from  Jan. 15 to Dec. 15. To be  eligible to sign, players must be  at least 16  years old and turn 17 by  Sept. 1 of the following year.  This year's  newly eligible players were  born between Sept. 1, 2008,  and Aug. 31,  2009.      Bonus pools   International bonus pools, the money teams can spend on players, are    tied to revenue and market size. Generally speaking, small-market  teams  get the  biggest bonus pools and large-market teams get the  smallest.  There  are  bonus pool penalties  for signing major-league  free agents  who declined the qualifying offer, and teams can trade for  an   additional 60% of their original bonus pool. The bonus pools are a  hard  cap. You cannot spend more than you're allotted.   Here are the 2026 international bonus pools as reported by Baseball America:   $8,034,900: Cardinals, Diamondbacks, Guardians, Orioles, Pirates, Rockies, Royals$7,357,100: Athletics, Brewers, Mariners, Marlins, Rays, Reds, Tigers, Twins$6,679,200: Angels, Braves, Cubs, Dodgers, Nationals, Phillies, Rangers, White Sox$5,940,000: Blue Jays, Padres, Red Sox$5,440,000: Astros, Giants, Mets, YankeesThe Blue Jays (Anthony Santander), Padres (Nick Pivetta), and Red Sox (Alex Bregman) each forfeited $500,000 in bonus pool money to sign a qualified free agent last offseason. The Astros (Christian Walker), Giants (Willy Adames), Mets (Juan Soto), and Yankees (Max Fried) each forfeited $1 million because they exceeded the competitive balance tax threshold.   \nBonuses of $10,000 or less do not count against  the bonus pool.  Players who get bonuses that small usually aren't great  prospects,  though every so often one breaks through and reaches the big  leagues.  Houston signed both Cristian Javier and Framber Valdez to $10,000 bonuses as amateurs, for example. The Tigers signed Eugenio Suárez for $10,000 way back in the day. International   players younger than 25 can sign minor-league contracts only.  Teams  cannot  entice these players by offering to put them on the 40-man   roster. Yoshinobu Yamamoto was posted out of NPB at age 25 and thus wasn't subject to the international bonus pools, allowing him to sign his  record $325 million contract. Roki Sasaki was posted at 23 and was subject to the bonus pools.      Top prospects   As good as scouts are these days and as much data as teams have, it is really difficult to project ahead when you're talking about players this young. A player who looks like the best prospect today could get lapped by several others in a few months time. It is the nature of the beast. Here are a few of the top prospects for the 2026 international signing period, listed alphabetically.   \nSS Wandy Asigen, Dominican Republic: Perhaps the most famous player in this year's international free agent class, Asigen has the defensive chops to remain at shortstop long-term, and MLB Pipeline praises his \"special left-handed swing.\" He signed with the Mets for $3.9 million.C Fernando Graterol, Venezuela: Graterol is the top backstop available in international free agency this year. \"Graterol's offensive profile centers around his big-time raw power ... Equipped with a cannon of a throwing arm, Graterol fits the bill of what clubs look for from a teenage catching prospect,\" writes MLB Pipeline. The White Sox signed him for $1.6 million.   SS Luis Hernandez, Venezuela: The consensus No. 1 prospect of the signing period, Hernandez is touted as the best international prospect in several years. \"Gifted with immense physical projection and a laundry list of impressive  tools ... (he) also earns plus marks for his  work ethic and all-around baseball IQ,\" writes MLB Pipeline. Hernandez signed with the Giants for $5 million.   \nLHP Andri Hidalgo, Dominican Republic: In a down year for international prospect arms, Hidalgo is considered the best pitcher available. MLB Pipeline says he has an \"extremely high ceiling\" thanks to a promising fastball/slider/changeup package. He signed with the Orioles for $625,000.OF Francisco Renteria, Venezuela: Renteria is the top power-hitting prospect available this year. He held his own during a brief stint in the Venezuelan Major League last summer and MLB Pipeline says he's earned comparisons to Pirates prospect Konnor Griffin, one of the best prospects in the minors. The Phillies signed him for $4 million.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Sam Darnold has been labeled as questionable for Saturday's divisional round playoff matchup with the San Francisco 49ers. The Seattle Seahawks' starting quarterback was added to Thursday's injury report with an oblique injury. Darnold confirmed that the injury occurred during the routes on air portion of Thursday's practice. He said he felt some discomfort on his oblique on the left side and decided not to take any risks regarding practice. \"Didn't wanna push it,\" he said after practice. \"Wasn't the day to push it. That was it. Came inside, got some rehab, and feel like I'll be ready to go for Saturday.\"Darnold said that there is a \"very low percentage\" that he isn't on the field for Seattle's first playoff game. \"Probably closer to zero,\" he said with a slight smile. Darnold, 28, has been a big key to Seattle's success this season under second-year coach Mike Macdonald. Following a Pro Bowl season with the Vikings last year, Darnold was named to his second straight Pro Bowl this season after throwing for over 4,000 yards and 25 touchdowns in helping lead the 14-3 Seahawks to the NFC's No. 1 seed for the postseason. \nDarnold split his two starts this season against the 49ers, throwing for less than 200 yards in both games and not throwing a touchdown pass. He didn't throw any interceptions in those games either while completing 73.5% of his passes. \nIf Darnold isn't able to play, the Seahawks would turn the keys of the offense over to Drew Lock, who during Thursday's practice received reps with Seattle's first-team offense. Lock, 29, is a former second-round pick who attempted just three passes during the regular season. He does have 28 career regular season starts under his belt that includes 13 starts in 2020, his second season with the Broncos. \"Drew's been really impressive throughout OTAs and training camp and in his role,\" Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak said following Thursday's practice. \"Started a lot of football games, 28 games in the league. Lot of confidence in Drew. Brought him here for a reason.\" While Lock will have to be ready, Darnold has made it clear that he fully expects to be on the field while making his second career postseason start. \n\"We'll attack it the next couple of days and be ready for Saturday,\" he said. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Although not yet officially official, John Harbaugh will be the next head coach of the New York Giants. According to Ian Rapoport and long-time Giants beat reporter Gary Myers, former Ravens offensive coordinator Todd Monken will be joining Harbaugh as the next Giants offensive coordinator. The decision to bring Monken with him makes a lot of sense from Harbaugh's standpoint and not just due to his familiarity and relationship -- the numbers back it up. The Ravens had a nearly historically strong offense in 2024 under Monken and maintained that level of performance throughout his tenure as offensive coordinator, particularly when Lamar Jackson was healthy.During the 2023 and 2024 seasons, when Jackson was fully healthy, the Ravens offense was a dominant unit. In 2023, they ranked fourth-best in the NFL in points per game, first in rushing yards per game, third in yards per play and sixth in offensive EPA per play. In 2024, Monken's offense saw significant growth, jumping to third in points per game, first in yards per play and the No. 1 offense in EPA per play all while maintaining the league lead in rushing yards per game. In 2025, things took a step back as Jackson played through injuries and Tyler Huntley was forced into action.For further context on Monken's borderline historical 2024 offense, Jackson reached career bests as a passer with 41 touchdowns and the Ravens achieved their best explosive play rate in franchise history while averaging over 30 points per game. While this is exciting news for the Giants' offense as a whole, it could mean even bigger things for running backs Cam Skattebo and Tyrone Tracy Jr. Before his injury, Skattebo had broken out as an RB1 in Fantasy in large part due to his red zone role and efficiency scoring touchdowns plus his unique ability in the pass game. Under Monken, the Ravens had a dominant rushing attack. Skattebo has a chance to break into the RB1 ranks in 2026 and will be one of the highest upside draft picks.\nWhere Monken could make his biggest impact on Jaxson Dart is via the passing game. In each of his three seasons with Monken, Jackson topped 8 yards per attempt after averaging 6.9 yards per pass in his final season with Greg Roman as offensive coordinator. Dart's dominant rookie season from a Fantasy Football standpoint was mostly a result of his usage (and efficiency) as a runner. Dart scored over 100 Fantasy points on the ground with nine rushing touchdowns and 487 rushing yards. The rushing is part of Dart's game, unlikely to go away with Monken, and a big part of what makes him an exciting Fantasy Football pick -- but it's the passing that stands to make the leap under Monken.\nFrom a schematic standpoint, Monken is an excellent fit for Dart. In 2025, Brian Daboll and Mike Kafka took a hard look at their personnel once Malik Nabers was placed on injured reserve and decided that heavy personnel packages featuring multiple tight ends (12 personnel) would be the best way to maximize the offense. They were right. Dart thrived in these situations. Under Monken, the Ravens used light personnel groupings (11 personnel) fewer than any team in the NFL in 2025. Instead, they featured 12 personnel 35% of the time (the Giants were at 38%) and they mixed in 21 personnel (one tight end, one running back, one fullback) on 21% of their snaps.\nRavens fullback Patrick Ricard is a free agent this offseason and could be on the Giants' radar. Ricard is the type of player that makes the entire offense around him better and would be another boost to Dart's Fantasy outlook in 2026.Another way Monken fits the Giants and Dart like a glove is via the RPO (run-pass option game). The Giants relied heavily on RPOs in 2025 with Dart, using it as a way to quickly acclimate the rookie to concepts that he was comfortable running from his time at Ole Miss. However, in today's NFL, the RPO is a valuable tool for all offenses -- not just the college game. During the 2023 and 2024 seasons, Monken ranked first in the NFL with 101 RPO play calls in 2023 and fifth with 91 in 2024. The Giants ranked fifth in the NFL in RPO play calls in 2025 with Dart.\nDart is going to be one of the highest-upside Fantasy picks at quarterback in 2026 drafts. Jamey Eisenberg recently polled the FFT team on their early 2026 quarterback rankings and Dart ranked as high as QB5 (Jacob Gibbs). He was in the top 12 of almost everyone's early rankings. If Nabers trends in the right direction in his return from an ACL tear, Dart's stock will rise even higher. Monken brings a proven track record, an adaptive scheme that fits Dart and excitement for any Fantasy Football managers who plan to invest in the Giants in their 2026 drafts. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Just over three months after he suffered a devastating ankle injury, San Francisco 49ers linebacker Fred Warner returned to practice on Tuesday. Wednesday, he even said he wouldn't rule himself out for Saturday's divisional round game against the Seattle Seahawks.Thursday, though, coach Kyle Shanahan that Warner will not play -- not because of any setback, but simply because he isn't ready to return to game action. Shanahan said he's confident that Warner has put himself in position to play in the NFC Championship Game should the 49ers beat Seattle but added, \"We'll see if it works out.\"Such a speedy recovery is a remarkable feat for Warner, who was initially deemed out for the season when he broke and dislocated his ankle in Week 6 against the Bucs. Warner underwent surgery after teammate Ji'Ayir Brown rolled up on his leg and twisted his ankle at an awkward angle.\"We're taking it day by day,\" Warner said Wednesday when asked if he anticipated playing this weekend. \"I think they said last week they weren't going to open my [practice] window, and then my window is now open. So we're just taking it day by day.\"\nWarner was part of the wave of injuries that devastated the 49ers early in the year. Defensive end Nick Bosa was lost for the season due to a torn ACL he suffered in Week 3, and key contributors including quarterback Brock Purdy and Ricky Pearsall also missed time. Star tight end George Kittle saw his campaign come to a close in the Wild Card round when he tore an Achilles tendon.Despite the poor injury luck, San Francisco stands just two wins away from the Super Bowl.The 49ers surrendered a modest 19 points to the Philadelphia Eagles in the Wild Card round and gave up just 13 points to the Seahawks in the season finale, impressive feats after struggling for much of the season following the Warner injury.\n\"I feel amazing,\" Warner said. \"Just so grateful, blessed to be back. I think, obviously, when all this happened, I didn't really think about the possibility of returning in-season. But the way things progressed and being able to have this opportunity to be back with my teammates, have a chance at helping them win this week and so on and so forth, that's my only goal moving forward.\"While the injury dashed his chances of securing first-team All-Pro honors for the fourth consecutive year and fifth time in six seasons, Warner has a chance to rewrite an otherwise lost season if the 49ers can win one more game. He is one of the best linebackers in the NFL and would contribute immense amounts of leadership and playmaking ability to the middle of the defense if.\"Fred's the ultimate energy-giver, so just having him out there is awesome,\" defensive coordinator Robert Saleh said Wednesday. \"Yesterday was a little bit more tempo down, but today obviously with higher tempo it'll be fun to get him out there, see him running around.\"\nWarner had not missed a game in his career prior to the injury. If he does not play again this year, he will finish with a career-low 51 tackles, two tackles for loss and three passes defended.\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe New England Patriots and Houston Texans both used stifling defensive efforts to carry the day in their Wild Card Weekend playoff victories. Something has to give when the No. 2-seeded Patriots host the No. 5-seeded Texans on Sunday in the Divisional Round of the NFL playoffs. Kickoff from Gillette Stadium is set for 3 p.m. ET in the nationally-televised contest.  The AFC East champion Patriots are coming off a dominant 16-3 victory over the Los Angeles Chargers in which they sacked Justin Herbert six times and allowed 207 yards of total offense while holding Los Angeles to 1-of-10 on third-down attempts. The Texans used a similar profile as their rugged defense broke open a tight game in the second half for a 30-6 victory over the homestanding Pittsburgh Steelers. Houston allowed just 175 yards of total offense and 3.1 yards per play, and two late defensive scores helped overcome a three-turnover performance from quarterback C.J. Stroud. New England is a three-point favorite at home and the over/under for total points scored is 40.5, per the latest DraftKings NFL odds for Texans vs. Patriots. Here is a look at the Texans vs. Patriots matchup from a betting perspective: Texans vs. Patriots oddsOpening spread: Patriots -3Opening money line: Patriots -175, Texans +145 Opening total: 41, now 40.5  Texans betting profile\nOpening win total: 8.5 wins  W/L record: 12-5ATS record:10-7O/U record: 7-10The Texans quietly overcame an 0-3 start -- by 13 combined points -- to end the regular season on a nine-game winning streak behind one of the NFL's top-rated defenses. A national TV audience on Monday night saw what that menacing group, with a relentless pass rush and ball-hawking secondary, is capable of. However, they were fortunate that Pittsburgh is an extremely limited offensive team because Stroud's consistent troubles with the snap (he had five total fumbles) and shaky decision-making kept the Steelers in the game for three quarters and could have spelled doom against a higher-quality opponent such as the one they will face Sunday in the Patriots. Patriots betting profile\nOpening win total: 8.5 wins  W/L record: 14-3ATS record: 11-6O/U record: 9-8 The Patriots were a trendy pick to exceed their over/under win total and perhaps contend for a playoff berth, and they cleared both hurdles with room to spare. There's little doubt they were aided by the NFL's weakest schedule but, even so, a road win over the Bills and their wild-card victory over the Chargers illustrated that this team is no fluke. Second-year quarterback Drake Maye, who is an MVP candidate, didn't have his best game in the opening round but still outplayed Herbert, who has yet to notch a playoff victory. Maye sealed the game with late TD pass to Hunter Henry. Maye threw for 268 yards and added a team-best 66 rushing yards as the Patriots moved one win away from an AFC title game appearance in their first year under coach Mike Vrabel. Texans-Patriots prop pick: C.J. Stroud Over 0.5 interceptions\nAlthough we believe the Houston defense is strong enough to carry the Texans to a Super Bowl appearance, the alarmingly poor play of Stroud in the opening round is a concern that can't be ignored. All the Texans need from the former No. 2 overall pick is a game manager-plus profile, one that includes playing mistake-free football with the occasional big play mixed in, and Stroud has shown such ability in the past. But he looked uncomfortable from the start against the Steelers and appeared unwilling to use his legs to get a first down when the opportunity presented itself. This dynamic caused his awful red-zone interception. Stroud's lack of accountability also was concerning as afterward he repeatedly told a stunned media contingent -- many of whom believed he was trolling -- that he thought he played well in the victory. While a similar performance will guarantee a Houston exit, we're hoping for better from the third-year QB who, in fairness, has led the Texans to the Divisional Round in all three seasons as their starter. But we expect the Patriots' varied looks to force Stroud into at least one mistake and feel comfortable that he will cash the Over on this interception prop.  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The MLB offseason may be moving slowly, but all signs are that it's picking up. In the past few days, we've seen the Cubs land Alex Bregman on a five-year, $175 million deal and the Red Sox sign Ranger Suárez to a five-year, $130 million deal. Heading into the offseason, CBS Sports ranked Bregman as the second-best free agent available while Suárez ranked No. 10. Hey, that's progress. Only four of the top 12 free agents still need homes, though it's six of the top 14 and that still feels like too many for Jan. 15. Movement is good and it sounds like we're about to see more. Tucker decision expected very soonThere is much reporting around free-agent outfielder Kyle Tucker that suggests his decision on where to sign will happen Thursday. Tucker was our No. 1 free agent heading into the offseason. The teams known to be heavily involved in the bidding: The Mets are said to have a \"four-year offer on the table,\" according to the New York Post. This deal would end up being a monster average annual value contract with something like $50 million per season and there's plenty of upside for Tucker in taking such a deal, only to hit the market again at age 32.The Blue Jays might be the home for Tucker if he prefers a much longer deal. \"The Toronto Blue Jays have really been the only team that has shown the willingness to go as deep as 10 years, potentially,\" ESPN's Jeff Passan said on Sportsnet. The Jays are coming off a trip to the World Series and already have a strong pitching staff and offense. The Dodgers have also been connected to Tucker (via the New York Post, for one). Many people tend to believe the Dodgers don't need anything else, but their current outfield has Tommy Edman in center and Andy Pages in left with Alex Call as a backup option. There's certainly room to add Tucker. At this point, any other team strongly in the Tucker bidding would be a surprise. \nRed Sox focused on bats nowAs noted above, the Red Sox have added Suárez to a great rotation headed up by Garrett Crochet, Suárez, Sonny Gray and Brayan Bello. As for the offense, it could probably use a little more thunder, particularly after losing Alex Bregman to free agency, and, sure enough, The Athletic reports that the Red Sox's focus is now adding a bat. The exploration for offense includes both free agency and trade. On the trade front, the Red Sox have a bunch of starting pitching depth right now and Bello was \"quietly shopped\" earlier this offseason. Maybe they go that direction again, only less quiet this time? Further, there is an extra outfielder on the team (Roman Anthony, Jarren Duran, Wilyer Abreu and Ceddanne Rafaela are all starting caliber and Masataka Yoshida is still around), so perhaps there would be a fit for Duran somewhere else. If the Red Sox do go the route of free agency, Bo Bichette is still available and they could also make a run at Eugenio Suárez. Making a trade is always trickier, but Brendan Donovan of the Cardinals is known to be available and there have been rumors all offseason about the fit (plus, the Red Sox have already made two trades with the Cardinals this offseason in landing both Gray and Willson Contreras).\nRockies agree to terms with utility manThe Rockies and Willi Castro have agreed to a two-year deal worth $12.8 million, according to ESPN. He has experience in the majors at every single position except catcher and first base (yes, even 4 ⅔ innings on the mound). Most of his defensive work has come at shortstop, second base and left field, but he's handled a lot of third base, center field and right field. In 120 games last season for the Twins and Cubs, he hit .226/.313/.366 (89 OPS+) with 17 doubles, three triples, 11 home runs, 33 RBI, 58 runs and 10 steals. He was an All-Star in 2024. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The New York Giants made a massive move late Wednesday night, as they're now working to finalize an agreement with former Baltimore Ravens head coach John Harbaugh to be their next head coach, CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones confirmed. Harbaugh was immediately the most sought-after name on the market once he and the Ravens parted ways, and the Giants struck quickly to work on a deal with Harbaugh before he could take reported meetings with the Tennessee Titans and Atlanta Falcons this weekend. From the Giants' perspective, this has to be considered an excellent hire -- an \"A,\" if you will.\n        \n            \n                John Harbaugh's first 100 days: The blueprint to rebuild the Giants\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHarbaugh was extremely successful with the Ravens, compiling a 180-113 regular-season record and making the playoffs 12 times in 18 seasons, going 13-11 in the postseason and winning a Super Bowl back in 2012. A CEO-style head coach who was a former special-teams coordinator, Harbaugh was nevertheless at the forefront of leaguewide trends like aggressive fourth-down decision-making and he showed the ability to adapt with the times and with the construction of his roster, repeatedly seeking out new ideas on both sides of the ball so that he could mold the system around his players rather than try to fit square pegs into round holes. \nHe'll bring immediate stability and competence to a Giants organization that has been desperate for it over at least the last decade, as it has cycled through coach after coach and disappointment after disappointment. He should also be able to bring with him a strong coaching staff, given the connections he has made over the years and the various coaches who have worked with him at one time or another. Reports have already circulated that he'll bring Todd Monken to New York as his offensive coordinator, which would be a very good hire as the Giants look to build their future around Jaxson Dart. Lamar Jackson was already a superstar before Monken got to Baltimore, but he certainly helped take Jackson's game to another level. If he can do the same for Dart, that would be extremely beneficial as the Giants look to improve after being one of the worst teams in the league. We don't yet know who Harbaugh would like to bring with him on the defensive side of the ball, but he's repeatedly found top defensive minds over the years. He's had coaches like Rex Ryan, Vic Fangio, Chuck Pagano, Dean Pees, Teryl Austin, Wink Martindale, Steve Spagnuolo, Mike Macdonald, Leslie Frazier, Jesse Minter, Zach Orr, Anthony Weaver and Dennard Wilson work under him as either coordinators or position coaches at one time or another over the last decade-plus, and the Ravens have routinely had one of the NFL's better defenses. A great deal of that obviously has to do with the talent they have been able to land on that side of the ball, thanks to an excellent front office, but Harbaugh has also brought in a bunch of strong defensive coaches, as mentioned.\nHarbaugh's age (he'll turn 64 early next season) and the Ravens' recent propensity for blowing leads are slight concerns here, but they're mitigated by his long track record of success and the Giants' desperate need for someone who can professionalize the organization. You can, of course, find that type of coach anywhere if you turn over the right stones, but the Giants obviously valued Harbaugh's pedigree highly, and they moved quickly to strike on the man many viewed as the top candidate available this cycle.What others are sayingCBS Sports senior NFL writer Pete Prisco was even more effusive in his praise of the Harbaugh hiring.\"For him, it's an 'A',\" Prisco said. \"It's the best job out there. And I said that when all the jobs opened up. And people say, 'What are you saying?' Well, it's the Giants. The New York Giants. You're in New York. \n\"And not only that, you have a lot of young talent on that team to build around. If you look at the NFL, what do you want? You want a quarterback and you want pass rushers. Well, they have it. If you believe in Jaxson Dart -- and I think he can be successful -- then you have the quarterback and the pass rushers, so it makes sense from that standpoint. So, from his standpoint, it's an A. \"From the Giants' standpoint, A+. You targeted him, you went and got him, and now it's all on you to make sure it works around him. I think this is a no-brainer hire for both sides. If I were John Harbaugh, that's the job I would want. If I were the New York Giants, John Harbaugh's the guy I would want.\"CBS Sports HQ NFL analyst Danny Kanell echoed many of those sentiments. \"I will give it an 'A+',\" Kanell said. \"This was the only coach that would come in and have us talking about this Giants organization as potentially a playoff team. And I don't think it'll only be me. With the young nucleus of talent that the Giants have on this roster, with the track record of success in building a winning culture, with the coordinator that he's most likely going to bring in with him, I think this is a home run hire for the Giants.\"\nYou're not going to find very many people out there who don't think this hiring is one of the better hirings of the cycle, no matter who lands the other available jobs. Harbaugh was sought after for a reason, and the Giants were able to land him before anyone else had a chance. Even if it doesn't work out, the process that led here was likely solid, even if it seemed somewhat predetermined that the Giants would zero in on Harbaugh if he ever became available.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The World Baseball Classic is set for this coming spring and the event has been growing in popularity among fans and players alike. The USA roster this time around is as loaded as it has ever been. To wit, the rotation right now is fronted by both 2025 Cy Young winners with plenty of All-Stars behind them. It's Tarik Skubal, Paul Skenes, Logan Webb, Joe Ryan and, if a fifth starter is even needed, Matthew Boyd and Nolan McLean. Don't worry about the back-end of the bullpen because Mason Miller and David Bednar are on board. The roster isn't yet complete, but there's a loaded lineup in the process of being built. Both Cal Raleigh and Will Smith are lined up as the catching duo. Bryce Harper, Brice Turang, Gunnar Henderson and Bobby Witt Jr. were already rostered before a good third baseman came aboard, but then Alex Bregman joined the fray. Kyle Schwarber is on board for the DH spot and Byron Buxton recently joined an outfield that already included Aaron Judge, Corbin Carroll and Pete Crow-Armstrong.Using only the players on board so far, here's what a Team USA lineup might look like: 1. Bobby Witt Jr., SS2. Aaron Judge, RF3. Cal Raleigh, C4. Kyle Schwarber, DH5. Bryce Harper, 1B6. Gunnar Henderson, 2B7. Alex Bregman, 3B8. Corbin Carroll, LF9. Pete Crow-Armstrong, CF\nNow, there's a lot to sort out here and so many different routes that could be taken. I like stacking the power toward the top of the order and then having the base-stealers all at the bottom, so every time through the order after the first, you're looking at Carroll and PCA as table-setter types for the thunder. Buxton could also start in center and we could throw him ahead of Carroll in the lineup. The bench then would have two amazing players with speed and defense in PCA and Turang for the late innings. I moved Henderson to second base to maximize how ridiculous that lineup could look, but surely Turang will get plenty of starts at second and Henderson could split time at short with Witt. In fact, since Henderson swings lefty and Witt is right-handed, they could platoon. Speaking of which, Pete Alonso, among others, has expressed interest in playing and could platoon with Harper at first base. And it should be noted that PCA is left-handed while Buxton is a righty, so, again, there could be a platoon in the outfield as well. Keep in mind that it's unlikely USA would want to catch Raleigh every game. He's a switch-hitter while Smith hits right-handed, so they could, again, platoon. It's funny to think about platooning all these All-Stars, but with this group it's reasonable and a good illustration of how loaded this squad is. There's defensive versatility in the outfield and infield as well, too. \nWhatever route is taken here and whoever else joins the team, USA manager Mark DeRosa has an embarrassment of riches.\n            ",

Whitmore has been out since early December after further evaluation discovered that his right shoulder soreness was DVT.Whitmore joins a growing list of NBA players who have been diagnosed with DVT in the past few seasons. Damian Lillard missed time with DVT after a blood clot was found in his calf. Similarly, Victor Wembanyama's season was cut short last February due to a blood clot found in his right shoulder from DVT. He missed the last 29 games of the season.DVT can cause blood clots in the veins of the arms or legs, and can be tricky to detect as the symptoms aren't too dissimilar from general muscle soreness. But detecting and treating them is crucial, as the blood clot can potentially travel to the lungs and cause pulmonary embolism, which can be life threatening.Whitmore finishes the season having played in 21 games, while averaging 9.2 points and 2.8 rebounds on 45.6% from the field. Missing the remainder of the season is a tough blow for the third-year forward, but recent history has shown that players who have been diagnosed with DVT have managed to make a full recovery. Wembanyama has been putting up MVP-level numbers this season after missing a significant portion of last season with DVT. Ausar Thompson was sidelined for the last month of his rookie season, and remained out for the first month of last season, and has been putting up career numbers for a Pistons team that sits first in the East standings.\nWhile it's certainly not how Whitmore wanted his season to go, prioritizing his long-term health is important in this situation. For the Wizards, given they're just 10-29 on the season, while they'll miss Whitmore's production, they're likely already looking ahead to the draft lottery this summer as they plan for their future beyond just this season.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Federal prosecutors charged 26 people on Thursday, including several former and current college basketball players, in an alleged point-shaving scheme, according to an indictment obtained by CBS News. The indictment states that more than 39 college basketball players on at least 17 Division I teams \"fixed and attempted to fix\" over 29 games.  Seventeen former college basketball players are listed as defendants in the indictment. Fifteen of those players participated in the 2023-24 or 2024-25 seasons. A few have also played this season. Four of the current players listed in the indictment are: Kennesaw State's Simeon Cottle, the preseason Conference USA Player of the Year, who was averaging 20.2 points; Delaware State's Camian Shell (8.0 ppg); Eastern Michigan's Carlos Hart (13.1 ppg); and Texas Southern's Oumar Koureissi (4.9 ppg).  The list of schools with current or former players alleged to have participated in game-fixing: Abilene Christian, Alabama State, Buffalo, Coppin State, DePaul, Eastern Michigan, Fordham, Kennesaw State, La Salle, New Orleans, Nicholls, North Carolina A&T, Northwestern State, Robert Morris, Saint Louis, Southern Miss and Tulane. \nBeyond that, investigators also identified Western Michigan, Butler, St. John's, East Carolina, McNeese State, Duquesne, La Salle, Kent State, Ohio, Georgetown as schools affected by the alleged scheme which involved millions of dollars illegally wagered on dozens of mid-major games that past two seasons.  Even with a lack of high-major schools involved and with no big-name players attached, the scope of the scheme, if proven accurate, would rank among the largest gambling conspiracies in the history of college athletics. Two of the primary targets of the investigation are non-athletes, men who built an elaborate plan to get rich illicitly by scheming to fix games far off the mainstream path of college basketball. Shane Hennen and Marves Fairley were purportedly at the center of a conspiracy that includes charges of wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bribery in sports. \nAccording to the indictment, the scheme began in September 2022 with illegal gambling activity tied to professional basketball in China. Former LSU player Antonio Blakeney was a star for the Chinese Basketball Association's Jiangsu Dragons and, per investigators, fixed games overseas. From there, Blakeney worked with Hennen, Fairley and other co-conspirators to recruit a litany of mid- and/or low-major college basketball players to fix the outcomes of first-half totals and overall games. Players at smalls schools (who were not making big money in NIL deals) allegedly accepted deals of $10,000 to $30,000 to intentionally compromise games for sports betting purposes, according to the FBI.Blakeney, a former five-start prospect in the class of 2015, has been separately charged in an undisclosed case. \n\"We allege an extensive international criminal conspiracy of NCAA players, alumni and professional bettors who fixed gains across the country and poisoned the American spirit of competition for monetary gain,\"U.S. Attorney David Metcalf said Thursday morning at a press conference in Philadelphia.The betting amounts are eye-opening: $458,000 for NC A&T to lose against Towson; $424,000 on Kent State to cover a first-half spread vs. Buffalo; $275,000 for Southern Miss to not cover a first-half spread against South Alabama; $256,000 for Robert Morris to flop in the first half of a game against Northern Kentucky.These are massive numbers on afterthought games. Sportsbooks can track all betting patterns, and even with a variety of people in a criminal conspiracy betting on a game in somewhat-smaller amounts, the collective action on a single mid-major contest will be immediately flagged by either the sportsbooks themselves or third-party watchdogs that monitor for integrity purposes.\n\"This was a massive scheme that enveloped the world of college basketball,\" Metcalf said, adding, \"this was a significant and rampant corruption of college athletics.\" The FBI's indictment cut at the heart of the case: \"In placing these wagers on games they had fixed, the defendants defrauded sportsbooks, as well as individual sports bettors, who were all unaware that the defendants had corruptly manipulated the outcome of these games that should have been decided fairly, based on genuine competition and the best efforts of the players.\"A lot of the schools and players tagged in the case did not catch the NCAA by surprise. The organization has been able to work independently of the FBI's probe, the existence of which was known for more than a year. Shortly after Thursday's news broke, NCAA president Charlie Baker had a statement prepared.\n\"Protecting competition integrity is of the utmost importance for the NCAA,\" Baker said. \"We are thankful for law enforcement agencies working to detect and combat integrity issues and match manipulation in college sports. The pattern of college basketball game integrity conduct revealed by law enforcement today is not entirely new information to the NCAA. \"The NCAA's work is far from done, though. Every player whom the NCAA has found guilty of altering their stats intentionally to affect game lines and/our outcomes has been banned for life. The count heading into Thursday was 11; the number will rise in light of the FBI unsealing its case. The NCAA's enforcement staff has looked into \"approximately 40 student-athletes from 20 schools over the past year,\" per Baker. Most of the NCAA's cases overlap with the FBI's.\"The Association has and will continue to aggressively pursue sports betting violations in college athletics using a layered integrity monitoring program that covers over 22,000 contests, but we still need the remaining states, regulators and gaming companies to eliminate threats to integrity — such as collegiate prop bets — to better protect athletes and leagues from integrity risks and predatory bettors,\" Baker said. \"We also will continue to cooperate fully with law enforcement. We urge all student-athletes to make well-informed choices to avoid jeopardizing the game and their eligibility.\"  \nFormer New Orleans players Cedquavious Hunter and Dyquavian Short are among the defendants in Thursday's indictment. Hunter and Short were both sanctioned by the NCAA in November after the Committee on Infractions found that they were involved in illegal gambling and/or game-manipulation activity.The NCAA's investigation also included former Arizona State star BJ Freeman, New Orleans' Jamond Vincent and Mississippi Valley State's Donovan Sanders and Alvin Stredic. The NCAA stated at the time that its six cases were unconnected.  Thursday's news is the latest bad headline tied to alleged illegal gambling in American sports. Hennen and Fairley are central actors in both this case and the October shocker that included the arrests of 30 people in relation to an illegal poker ring and alleged illegal gambling on the NBA. That case most notably included charges against former NBA player Terry Rozier and former NBA player/Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups. That investigation was entirely separate from the high-profile story into former NBA player Jontay Porter, who allegedly manipulated his own stats for monetary gain and was quickly banned from the league.\nCross-referencing with the indictment's detailed allegations, here are the 29 games that the FBI believes were tampered with in men's D-I college basketball:Feb. 17, 2024: Nicholls-McNeese StateFeb. 18, 2024: Tulane-East CarolinaFeb. 19, 2024: Northwestern State-Texas A&M Corpus-Christi Feb. 20, 2024: Saint Louis-DuquesneFeb. 21, 2024: La Salle-St. BonaventureFeb. 23, 2024: Fordham-DuquesneFeb. 24, 2024: DePaul-GeorgetownFeb. 24, 2024: Buffalo-Western MichiganFeb. 27, 2024: Buffalo-Kent StateFeb. 28, 2024: Robert Morris-Northern KentuckyFeb. 28, 2024: Southern Miss-South AlabamaMarch 1, 2024: Southern Miss-LouisianaMarch 1, 2024: Kennesaw State-QueensMarch 2, 2024: Tulane-FAUMarch 2, 2024: DePaul-ButlerMarch 4, 2024: Coppin State-South Carolina StateMarch 5, 2024: Buffalo-OhioMarch 5, 2024: DePaul-St. John'sMarch 5, 2024: Robert Morris-Purdue Fort WayneMarch 11, 2024: New Orleans-LamarMarch 19, 2024: Abilene Christian-Texas A&M Corpus-ChristiMarch 20, 2024: Abilene Christian-Tarleton StateMarch 29, 2024: North Carolina A&T-TowsonNov. 21, 2024: Eastern Michigan-OaklandDec. 5, 2024: Alabama State-Southern MissDec. 21, 2024: Eastern Michigan-Wright StateDec. 28, 2024: New Orleans-McNeeseDec. 30, 2024: New Orleans-VanderbiltJan. 11, 2025: New Orleans-Southeastern Louisiana\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NFL playoffs are in full swing, but while most of the attention is on the teams chasing a Lombardi Trophy, a large chunk of the league has already turned its focus to the offseason.The biggest domino to fall so far was the Giants finalizing a deal with John Harbaugh to become their next head coach, but plenty of intrigue remains across the rest of the hiring cycle.With eight head-coaching jobs -- 25% of the league -- still open, let's play matchmaker. Below, we pair each vacant position with one of the top candidates on the market and examine why the fit makes sense.Follow live updates on NFL coaching and GM changes, firings and rumors.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Arizona Cardinals: Robert SalehPrevious position: 49ers defensive coordinatorSaleh is likely to be picky about his next job after his failed tenure with the New York Jets. One reason that first stint did not work out was New York's inability to identify a viable franchise quarterback. \nArizona is in a similar spot, as the Cardinals are widely expected to move on from Kyler Murray this offseason, but they hold the No. 3 overall pick in the NFL Draft, giving them a clear path to address the position. If and when Saleh and the Cardinals solve the quarterback issue, they would have intriguing weapons -- namely Trey McBride and Marvin Harrison Jr. -- to build around.While the quarterback situation matters, Saleh -- who has reportedly been requested to interview for the job -- would also be an attractive hire to fix what was a disastrous Arizona defense in 2025. The Cardinals allowed 28.7 points per game and 358.9 total yards per game, both of which ranked in the bottom 10 in the NFL. Even during his lean years in New York, Saleh was able to elevate the defense, and he has done a masterful job keeping an injury-riddled 49ers unit humming into the divisional round.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Atlanta Falcons: Mike McDanielPrevious position: Dolphins head coachThe Falcons are an intriguing destination this cycle. On one hand, they have a boatload of talent on both sides of the ball, headlined by superstar running back Bijan Robinson. However, whoever takes this job also needs to be confident they can get Michael Penix Jr. -- who has endured an up-and-down start to his career -- back on track. Penix is coming off a season-ending ACL injury, but team owner Arthur Blank said in his end-of-season news conference that he expects the former first-round quarterback to return to full strength.Mike McDaniel seems like a logical fit for a couple of reasons. First, he has experience getting the best out of a young quarterback, as he revitalized Tua Tagovailoa early in his tenure in Miami. There is reason to believe he could do the same with Penix, especially with a strong supporting cast already in place. \nSecond, there is familiarity between McDaniel and the organization thanks to the arrival of Matt Ryan as the franchise's president of football. McDaniel was an offensive assistant with the Falcons from 2015-16 under offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan, overlapping with Ryan's tenure as quarterback, including his MVP season in 2016.\n        \n            \n                Ranking head coaching vacancies: Which of these nine jobs is the most desirable?\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Baltimore Ravens: Kliff KingsburyPrevious position: Commanders offensive coordinator It's not hard to figure out which of the eight teams with a coaching vacancy is the cream of the crop. It's the Ravens, and it's not particularly close because of two-time NFL MVP Lamar Jackson. No other franchise searching for a head coach can offer that level of elite play and stability at quarterback, so Baltimore should have its pick of the litter. Kingsbury is widely viewed as one of the top candidates on the market this cycle, and he appears to be an ideal fit for Jackson and the rest of the Ravens offense.\nHe has previous head-coaching experience after leading the Cardinals from 2019 to 2022, and he most recently worked with Jayden Daniels as Washington's offensive coordinator. Daniels has a similar skill set to Jackson, and Kingsbury had him operating at a high level during his rookie season, which helped the Commanders reach the NFC Championship Game. If he can tune Baltimore's offense in a similar way around Jackson, the Ravens could be back among the league's top contenders in short order.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Cleveland Browns: Jim SchwartzPrevious position: Browns defensive coordinator It's rare to see a team fire its head coach and then simply elevate one of his coordinators, as most organizations prefer to clean house. However, Schwartz could be an exception. \nCleveland's defense was one of the few bright spots of the 2025 season, and from the outside looking in, Schwartz appeared to have strong buy-in from his players on that side of the ball. If he commands that level of respect inside the locker room, the transition would be seamless.He also has previous head-coaching experience, having led the Detroit Lions from 2009-13. If he wants another opportunity, this would be an intriguing setup, though much will hinge on what kind of offensive coordinator he brings aboard.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Las Vegas Raiders: Klint KubiakPrevious position: Seahawks offensive coordinator The Raiders are an intriguing organization this cycle. The Pete Carroll era crashed and burned, but there is hope for a brighter future. That is because a trying 2025 season resulted in Las Vegas landing the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, putting the franchise in position to select Heisman Trophy–winning quarterback Fernando Mendoza. \nIf Mendoza lives up to the hype, the Raiders would suddenly have a promising young core that includes the Indiana quarterback, along with running back Ashton Jeanty and tight end Brock Bowers. Pair that with roughly $98 million in projected cap space -- the third most in the NFL -- and this rebuild could be jump-started quickly. That should make Las Vegas an attractive destination for someone like Kubiak, who is among the most sought-after candidates.Over the past two years, Kubiak has built a reputation for elevating offenses. In New Orleans, he had the Saints punching above their weight in 2024. This season, as the Seahawks' offensive coordinator, Kubiak helped lead the team to the No. 1 seed in the conference with a dynamic offense. If he can get Sam Darnold to throw for more than 4,000 yards and run a unit that averages 5.9 yards per play -- tied for the third-highest in the NFL -- there's no telling what he could do with Mendoza if the rookie lives up to his billing as the top pick.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Miami Dolphins: Jesse MinterPrevious position: Chargers defensive coordinatorWith John Harbaugh landing with the Giants, where does Miami turn next? Well, how about Chargers defensive coordinator Jesse Minter?\nTeam owner Stephen Ross has deep ties to the University of Michigan as one of its top donors and has a relationship with Jim Harbaugh, under whom Minter is currently coaching with the Chargers. Minter served as Harbaugh's defensive coordinator at Michigan from 2022-23, including during the program's College Football Playoff national championship run in 2023, so Ross is well aware of him. This pairing also aligns better from a timeline perspective. Minter, 42, is young enough to help lead a rebuild, and Miami's defense played well down the stretch in 2025, giving him something to build on heading into 2026.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Pittsburgh Steelers: Brian FloresPrevious position: Vikings defensive coordinatorFlores would be a familiar face for the Steelers. The current Vikings DC worked under now former head coach Mike Tomlin in 2022 as a senior defensive assistant and linebackers coach after his tenure as the head coach of the Miami Dolphins ended in 2021. After that quick one-year stint in Pittsburgh, Flores moved on to Minnesota and has bolstered his reputation back up as one of the top defensive minds in the league, which feels like an ideal fit stylistically with the Steelers' identity.  \nThe big question for Flores as he looks for his second chance as an NFL head coach will be what Pittsburgh's plans are at quarterback. Aaron Rodgers has alluded to this being his final season, so they'll need an answer at the most important position in the sport. If he gets a clear enough answer there, working with former Defensive Player of the Year T.J. Watt could be extremely appealing to him. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Tennessee Titans: Kevin StefanskiPrevious position: Browns head coachStefanski is a two-time NFL Coach of the Year, and while his run in Cleveland ended, many of his issues there stemmed from the organization never solving the quarterback position. That would not be a problem in Tennessee, where the Titans have Cam Ward, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, under center. Ward flashed late in the season, and if Stefanski likes what he sees from the young quarterback, the Titans have a lot of potential.\nThe hardest part of a rebuild -- finding a quarterback -- is already in place, and the franchise is entering the offseason with roughly $102 million in cap space, the second most in the NFL, along with the No. 4 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. If the Titans can add the right pieces, they could become frisky sooner rather than later, depending on how quickly Stefanski can accelerate Ward's development.\n            ",

    "body": "<div>\n<p>The 2025-26 NBA season tips off later this month, meaning 2025 Fantasy basketball drafts are already on the clock. While everyone wants to find those undervalued Fantasy basketball sleepers or breakouts, just as much part of nailing your drafts is by avoiding selecting a 2025 Fantasy basketball bust. How will the likes of De'Aaron Fox, Brandon Ingram and Zach LaVine perform in their first full seasons with their new squads? Then there are players such as Kristaps Porzingis, Desmond Bane and Norman Powell who switched teams this offseason and could make for even better Fantasy basketball 2025 picks than they were with their prior teams.</p><p>Speaking of potential 2025 Fantasy basketball breakouts, Cooper Flagg will be top of mind for many when they go on the clock after the No.1 overall pick averaged 19.2 points, 7.5 rebounds, 4.2 assists, 1.4 steals and 1.4 blocks at Duke. But given the star power already on Dallas, with Anthony Davis and, eventually, Kyrie Irving, there could be other rookies in more advantageous positions to produce. What do the latest 2025 Fantasy basketball projections forecast for this year's rookie class? Before making any 2025-26 Fantasy basketball picks, be sure to <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nba/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/?ttag=09242025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_basketball_nba_model_cheatsheetscombined\" target=\"_blank\">check out the 2025 Fantasy basketball rankings and cheat sheets from the proven computer model at SportsLine</a>.</p><p>SportsLine's proven model simulates each season 10,0000 times. This model is powered by the same people who powered projections for all three major Fantasy sites. These cheat sheets and rankings, available for leagues on many major sites, are updated multiple times every day. Any time an injury occurs or there's a change on a roster, the team at SportsLine updates its cheat sheets. </p><p>Last year the model called a breakout season for Stephon Castle, predicting that he would finish 25 spots ahead of consensus ADP at his position. The result: Castle won NBA Rookie of the year honors after averaging 14.7 points, 4.1 assists and 3.7 rebounds per game and finished as the No. 51 guard in average Fantasy points per game on CBS despite being the 87th guard off the board on average.</p><p>The model also nailed James Harden as a sleeper last year before he put together his first All-Star season in three years and called Paolo Banchero's and Victor Wembanyama's breakout seasons before they went on to win NBA Rookie of the Year honors as well. Anyone who followed the model's Fantasy basketball advice on them could have been well on their way to making a deep postseason run.</p><p>Now, SportsLine has simulated the entire NBA season 10,000 times and released its latest Fantasy basketball rankings 2025-26, along with plenty of sleepers, breakouts and busts. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nba/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/?ttag=09242025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_basketball_nba_model_cheatsheetscombined\" target=\"_blank\">Head to SportsLine now to see these 2025-26 Fantasy basketball rankings</a>.  </p><h2> Top 2025 Fantasy basketball sleepers  </h2><p>One of the top 2025 Fantasy basketball sleepers the model is predicting: Bucks guard Kevin Porter Jr. After spending the 2023-24 season out of the league, Porter joined the Clippers last season before being acquired by Milwaukee at the trade deadline. He proceeded to become one of the Bucks most consistent players, averaging 11.7 points and 3.7 assists in just 19.9 minutes, and over his last five games of the season, Porter put up 20.2 points, 6.6 rebounds, 6.2 assists and 2.8 steals. Porter should see a huge jump in playing time this year with the injury and subsequent trade of Damian Lillard.</p><p>Porter is penciled in to be Milwaukee's starting point guard, and outside of Giannis Antetokounmpo, no other player on the Bucks' 2025-26 roster averaged more than 2.9 assists last year. Thus, the team will need both his ball-handling and playmaking skills, and Porter has already shown he can produce when given ample minutes. In the 2022-23 season with Houston, he was one of just five NBA players to average at least 19 points, five rebounds, five assists and 1.4 steals per game. He is someone whose production should far exceed his 2025 Fantasy basketball ADP of 72. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nba/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/?ttag=09242025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_basketball_nba_model_cheatsheetscombined\" target=\"_blank\">See more Fantasy basketball sleepers 2025 here</a>.</p><h2> Top 2025 Fantasy basketball breakouts  </h2><p>One of the 2025 Fantasy basketball breakouts the model has identified: Jazz point guard Isaiah Collier. The No. 1 ranked prospect in the Class of 2023, Collier starred at USC for one season before being the 29th overall pick by Utah in 2024. He began as a backup but then wrestled the starting job away from Keyonte George, who was an All-Rookie selection the year prior. Collier really hit his stride towards the end of the season and averaged 15.9 points and 7.1 assists over his final seven games of his rookie year.</p><p>Already one of the league's youngest teams, Utah then jettisoned vets Jordan Clarkson, Collin Sexton and John Collins in the offseason as it has fully embraced a youth movement. Thus, the 21-year-old Collier should have no shortage of opportunities, and he plays in an offense conducive for lots of stats. The Jazz ranked fifth in pace last season as they want to utilize those young legs to their advantage. The model slots Collier ahead of Klay Thompson and Jalen Suggs, despite those two being drafted earlier on average. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nba/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/?ttag=09242025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_basketball_nba_model_cheatsheetscombined\" target=\"_blank\">Identify other Fantasy basketball breakouts 2025 here</a>.</p><h2> Top 2025 Fantasy basketball busts </h2><p>As for players to avoid, the model lists Pelicans guard Jordan Poole as a Fantasy basketball bust. Poole spent last season as the No. 1 option on the Wizards but will have much more competition for shots in New Orleans. Zion Williamson and Trey Murphy III were both 20-point scorers a year ago, while New Orleans returns three additional players who put up double-figures. Plus, the team used the No. 7 overall pick on Jeremiah Fears, who plays the same position as Poole, so Fears could cut into Poole's opportunities.</p><p>Poole is also a bit of a one-trick pony as while he put up over 20 points a game a year ago, he had middling stats elsewhere with 4.5 assists, 3.0 rebounds and 1.3 steals. That one trick will be diminished with other mouths to feed in New Orleans, plus a potential midseason return from Dejounte Murray (Achilles) could further reduce Poole's role, and the former Warrior faded down the stretch as his averages dropped across the board post-All-Star break. The model ranks Poole outside the top 20 Fantasy point guards and not worthy of his current Fantasy basketball 2025 ADP of being a seventh-round pick. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nba/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/?ttag=09242025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_basketball_nba_model_cheatsheetscombined\" target=\"_blank\">Avoid these 2025 Fantasy basketball busts as well</a>.</p><h2> How to find proven 2025-26 Fantasy basketball rankings </h2><p>SportsLine is also extremely high on a surprising forward you aren't even thinking about being taken in the early rounds of 2025 Fantasy basketball drafts. This player is a top-3 Fantasy option at his position and is ranked ahead of stars like Kevin Durant and Paolo Banchero. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nba/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/?ttag=09242025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_basketball_nba_model_cheatsheetscombined\" target=\"_blank\">You can only see who it is, and the 2025 Fantasy basketball rankings for every player, at SportsLine</a>.</p><p><strong>So which 2025-26 Fantasy basketball sleepers, breakouts and busts should you target and fade, and which forward shocks the NBA as a top-3 player in positional rankings? <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nba/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/?ttag=09242025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_basketball_nba_model_cheatsheetscombined\" target=\"_blank\">Visit SportsLine now to get 2025-26 Fantasy basketball cheat sheets for every single position, all from the model that's nailed its Fantasy basketball picks</a>, and find out.</strong></p>\n            </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The Philadelphia Eagles haven't won a game by more than seven points this season, but the defending Super Bowl champions are 4-1 while covering the spread in three of those four victories, playing one of the toughest schedules in the league to open the 2025 NFL season. Four of their first five games came against teams that made the playoffs last season, but their Thursday Night Football matchup certainly isn't as daunting on paper as their previous five contests. The Eagles play the Giants, who went 3-14 last year and are 1-4 this season, and the SportsLine model projects Philadelphia to have a convincing victory, making the Eagles to cover a 7-point spread one of its Thursday best bets at DraftKings. Kickoff for Eagles vs. Giants is set for 8:15 p.m. ET, and the over/under for total points scored is 40.5. Giants receiver Darius Slayton is inactive with a hamstring injury.</p><p>With the latest <strong>DraftKings promo code</strong>, new users can get <strong>$200 in bonus bets </strong>if your first $5 bet wins. The model is also projecting a larger favorite to have no issues covering the number for Thursday college football bets, with Jacksonville State covering its 7-point spread against Sam Houston as another of its Thursday best bets at DraftKings. Jacksonville State won last year's Conference USA championship, and plays an 0-5 Sam Houston team on CBS Sports Network at 8 p.m. ET. That game has a robust over-under of 54.5.

The model is also on a sizzling 41-21 run on top-rated NFL picks dating back to 2024.

The Eagles held the Giants to 119 yards of total offense, and this time, they face a quarterback making just his third NFL start. Jaxson Dart faces a tough challenge against the Eagles' defense after the Giants turned the ball over five times against the Saints last week. The Eagles are coming off their first loss in a 21-17 final against the Broncos last week, and despite being 20-3 over their last 23 games, including the playoffs, panic seemed to ensue around the Eagles. The model expects the Eagles to quiet any outside noise around the team in a convincing victory, with the model projecting the Eagles to cover the spread in 63% of simulations.</p><h3>Jacksonville State (-7) vs. Sam Houston (-115)</h3><p>Sam Houston ranks 131st of 136 teams in scoring defense, allowing 41.6 points per game and at least 37 points in every contest over its 0-5 start. This could be one of its toughest tests yet against the reigning Conference USA champions and Jacksonville State defeated Liberty, 34-24, in its conference opener on Sept. 6. Jacksonville State running back Cam Cook has dominated on the ground this season, rushing for 614 rushing yards on 5.5 yards per carry in five games, including three games with at least 120 rushing yards. Freshman quarterback Caden Creel added 161 rushing yards in Jacksonville State's last game on Sept. 27, and the Gamecocks should be rested and well prepared off a bye week. The model projects Jacksonville State to cover the spread in 59% of simulations.</p><h3>Phillies vs. Dodgers Over 7.5 runs (-119)</h3><p>The Dodgers and Phillies went Over this total in two of three games this series, including on Wednesday in an 8-2 Philadelphia victory in Los Angeles. Kyle Schwarber hit two home runs on Wednesday after finishing second in baseball with 56 home runs this season. Shohei Ohtani (55 home runs) finished third, and this series features many of the top offensive players in baseball, such as Bryce Harper, Trea Turner, Freddie Freeman and Mookie Betts to go along with Schwarber and Ohtani. The Dodgers are starting Tyler Glasnow, who allowed five runs in two innings in his regular-season start against the Phillies in April. The Phillies are starting Christoher Sanchez, who allowed two runs over 5 2/3 innings in Game 1 and allowed four runs in each of his two starts against the Dodgers during the regular season. The model projects the Over to hit in 60.1% of simulations. <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanatics&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">Claim your $250 in Fancash here:</a></p><h2>Want more NFL, college football and MLB picks for Thursday?</h2><p><strong>You've seen the model's Thursday best bets.

Kennesaw State is coming off a 24-16 win over Middle Tennessee behind 101 rushing yards on 12 carries (8.4 yards per rush) from sixth-year senior Coleman Bennett last week. The 6-foot, 210-pound back is averaging 4.9 yards per carry this season. Kennesaw State's three-game winning streak has all come by protecting home field, and the Owls remain at home again on Thursday. The model projects the Owls to stay competitive with Louisiana Tech on their home field in this Conference USA matchup, with the Owls covering the spread in 62% of simulations.</p><ul><li><strong>Game: East Carolina Pirates vs. Tulane Green Wave, 7:30 p.m. ET</strong><br /></li><li><strong>The Pick: Under 54.5 points</strong></li></ul><p>The Under has hit in three straight Pirates games, and in four of their five contests this season. Meanwhile, the Under has also hit in back-to-back Tulane contests and in three of five games this year. None of the last three East Carolina games have even reached 50 combined points, largely due to the Pirates' stout defense. East Carolina ranks 13th in the nation in scoring defense (16 points per game), and Tulane is 67th in the nation in scoring at 26.2 ppg. The model projects the Under to hit in 69% of simulations.</p><ul><li><strong>Game: Southern Miss Golden Eagles vs. Georgia Southern Eagles, 8 p.m. ET</strong></li><li><strong>The Pick: Georgia Southern (+3)</strong></li></ul><p>Georgia Southern hosts Southern Miss on Thursday, and the Eagles are 2-0 at home this season. They've scored more than 40 points in both contests and covered the spread in both games. The Eagles rushed for more than 200 yards in each home game, led by senior running back OJ Arnold's 213 yards and three touchdowns over those two games. Southern Miss is 3-2 this season, but the Golden Eagles will play just their second game on the road. They lost to Louisiana Tech, 30-20, in their only road game this season. The model projects Georgia Southern to cover the spread in 73% of simulations.</p><ul><li><strong>Game: Jacksonville State Gamecocks vs. Sam Houston Bearkats, 8 p.m. ET</strong></li><li><strong>The Pick: Jacksonville State (-7.5)</strong></li></ul><p>It would be an understatement to say Sam Houston has struggled to keep opposing teams off the scoreboard this season, ranking 131st of 136 teams in scoring defense.

Jacksonville State is 2-3 this season, but the Gamecocks are 1-0 in Conference USA play heading into this conference matchup on CBS Sports Network. Junior Cam Cook has 614 rushing yards on 5.5 yards per carry to lead the Gamecocks, rushing for at least 75 yards in all five games and at least 120 yards in three contests.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>In a bout between arguably the two best teams in baseball -- at this time, not by record -- the NLDS between the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/LAD/los-angeles-dodgers/\">Dodgers</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/PHI/philadelphia-phillies/\">Phillies</a> came to an end on an unfortunate mishap. The Dodgers prevailed, and this doesn't taint their advancement one iota. In fact, the best teams are the ones who don't beat themselves. It was just a bummer to have such a well-played game end on an error that was also a bad decision. </p><p>A super-tense playoff game remained 1-1 heading to the bottom of the 11th. The Dodgers should be credited, also, with the rally that loaded the bases with two outs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3152041/andy-pages/\">Andy Pages</a> put the ball in play, which was another plus. It was just a comebacker to pitcher <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29075749/orion-kerkering/\">Orion Kerkering</a>, who knocked it down. That appeared to cause him to speed things up in his head. </p><p>Kerkering could have -- <em>he should have --</em> taken the easy out at first base, especially with Hye-seong Kim from third base having such a head start in breaking for home before the ball wasn't fielded cleanly. Once it wasn't fielded cleanly, there was no reason to even try the throw home. It appeared Kerkering panicked in making the hurried decision. Maybe a good throw would've gotten the runner and forced a 12th inning, but it was the wrong play.</p><p>And Kerkering threw it far out of the reach of catcher <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1947839/j-t-realmuto/\">J.T. Realmuto</a>. </p><p>The Phillies' season was over, just like that. No one should feel sorry for them as a team. They had a lead in Game 1. They staged a late rally in Game 2 that came up short. They had a 1-0 lead in this game and walked home the tying run in the seventh. They had scoring opportunities in Game 4, too, though only a small handful. They were simply defeated by a team that played better than them. And it would be folly to blame Kerkering for the series loss.</p>\n<p>\"I feel for [Kerkering] because he's putting it all on his shoulders,\" Phillies manager Rob Thomson said. \"But we win as a team and we lose as a team.\"  </p><p>The Dodgers appear to be rounding into shape at the right time. Though they failed to secure a bye and were the third seed in the NL behind the top-seeded <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIL/milwaukee-brewers/\">Brewers</a> and these Phillies, the Dodgers had an argument heading into the playoffs that they were the best team. They are the defending champs. They only won four fewer games than the Brewers, won 15 of their last 20 and are armed with all kinds of high-priced talent. </p><p>The Phillies, of course, have been here a lot. They were in the 2022 World Series and one game away in 2023. They won 95 games and had a bye last year. They won 96 and had a bye this year. The have power arms and power bats. </p>\n<p>The Brewers and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TOR/toronto-blue-jays/\">Blue Jays</a>, among teams still alive, also have arguments as the best teams in baseball and we're also in the middle of a tournament to decide the World Series champion. </p><p>But, man, the Phillies and Dodgers both seemed too strong to be facing each other in a five-game series instead of a seven-game series. And, hey, who knows? Maybe if it were a seven game series the Dodgers just would've won in five games we would have lamented that the series didn't live up to its billing. </p><p>Regardless, it was certainly a shame we didn't get to squeeze a fifth game out of this one, especially give the unfortunate manner in which it ended for the Phillies. </p>\n            </div>",

Yet Kerkering was unable to field the ball cleanly, and had to retrieve it from in front of the mound. Though he appeared to have ample time to fire to first base for the out, he instead attempted to throw home -- \"attempted,\" because his throw sailed wide, allowing the run to score. </p><p>Here's a look at the play in question:</p>\n<p>Kerkering, understandably, appeared distraught in the moment and as he came off the mound. Afterward, he shared his perspective with the press.</p><p>\"I won't say the pressure got to me, I just thought it was a faster throw to [catcher J.T. Realmuto] than trying to crossbody it to [first baseman <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1765813/bryce-harper/\">Bryce Harper</a>]. Just a horseshit throw,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/OnPattison/status/1976481955232501812\">Kerkering said</a>. He noted that he didn't hear anyone direct his throw to first base, verbally or otherwise. </p>\n<p>\"This really f----ing sucks right now,\" Kerkering said when he was asked if he could use this moment for good, \"but hopefully keep pushing, get over this hump.\"</p><p>A number of Phillies personnel weighed in on the play to offer their support to their pitcher.</p><p>\"Just keep his head up. He just got caught up in the moment a little bit. Coming down the stretch there, he pitched so well for us,\" manager Rob Thomson said he told Kerkering after the game. \"I feel for him because he's putting it all on his shoulders. But we win as a team and we lose as a team.\"</p>\n<p>\"Don't let it define who you are, your career, or anything like that,\" Harper, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nbcsportsphiladelphia.com/video/mlb/philadelphia-phillies/phillies-videos/bryce-harpers-full-postgame-availability-after-game-4-loss/689067/\">who had not talked with Kerkering before speaking with the press</a>, said. \"Obviously big moment, big situation, and kind of just got away from him right there.\" </p><p>Even the other clubhouse expressed empathy for Kerkering in Game 4's aftermath.</p><p>\"Kerkering is a stud. And you definitely feel for a player,\" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. \"I'm obviously happy that we won. But, yeah, he's had a heck of a year and he's a heck of a pitcher.\"</p><p>Kerkering's gaffe represents just the second time in Major League Baseball postseason history that a series ended on a walk-off error. The only other occurrence came back in 2016, when the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TOR/toronto-blue-jays/\">Toronto Blue Jays</a> defeated the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TEX/texas-rangers/\">Texas Rangers</a> in the American League Division Series on a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1947857/rougned-odor/\">Rougned Odor</a> throwing error, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/OptaSTATS/status/1976474668614943210\">according to the research conducted by OptaSTATS</a>.</p>\n<p>Kerkering, 24, appeared 69 times during the regular season and amassed a 3.30 ERA (134 ERA+) and a 2.41 strikeout-to-walk ratio. For his big-league career, he's compiled a 2.79 ERA (155 ERA+) and a 3.15 strikeout-to-walk ratio, making him one of the best relief arms in the Phillies bullpen.</p>\n            </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Sister Jean Dolores Schmidt, the former Loyola Ramblers team chaplain that became a famous figure during the men's basketball team's 2018 run to the Final Four, has died at 106 years old, the university <a href=\"https://news.luc.edu/stories/news/news-about-sister-jean/\" target=\"_blank\">announced Thursday night in a statement</a>:</p><blockquote><p>\"Loyola University Chicago is greatly saddened to confirm the death of Sister Jean Dolores Schmidt, BVM. This is a tremendous loss of someone who touched the lives of so many people. We appreciate everyone's thoughts & prayers during this difficult time.\"</p></blockquote><p>Sister Jean served Loyola's students for more than six decades, <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/sister-jean-iconic-march-madness-figure-retires-from-loyola-chicago-at-106/\" target=\"_blank\">retiring just last month</a></span>. She was a common sight at Loyola sporting events, and garnered national fame when her No. 11-seeded Ramblers embarked on a Cinderella run in the NCAA Tournament, upsetting No. 6 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/MIAMI/miami-fla-hurricanes/\">Miami</a>, No. 3 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/TENN/tennessee-volunteers/\">Tennessee</a>, No. 7 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/NEVADA/nevada-wolf-pack/\">Nevada</a> and No. 9 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/KSTATE/kansas-state-wildcats/\">Kansas State</a> before finally falling to No. 3 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/MICH/michigan-wolverines/\">Michigan</a> in the Final Four.</p><p>Sister Jean was born Dolores Bertha Schmidt on August 21, 1919, and she joined the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary in 1937. She began teaching at Mundelein College in 1961, and found her way to Loyola University Chicago when Mundelein merged with Loyola in 1991. Sister Jean became the chaplain for the men's basketball team in 1994.</p><p>\"In many roles at Loyola over the course of more than 60 years, Sister Jean was an invaluable source of wisdom and grace for generations of students, faculty, and staff,\" Loyola president Mark C. Reed said in a statement. \"While we feel grief and a sense of loss, there is great joy in her legacy. Her presence was a profound blessing for our entire community and her spirit abides in thousands of lives. In her honor, we can aspire to share with others the love and compassion Sister Jean shared with us.\" </p><p>While Sister Jean will be remembered by sports fans for her work with the Loyola basketball team, she was much, much more than that. She offered spiritual support for students at the university, held weekly prayer groups for students and started a program called <a href=\"https://www.luc.edu/communityrelations/stories/archive/llnwtc/theclarecornerloyolabringssmilestotheclare/\" target=\"_blank\">SMILE</a> (Students Moving Into the Lives of the Elderly). This project helped Loyola students reach out to an assisted living community named The Clare, and aimed to \"form intergenerational -- and meaningful -- relationships.\"</p><p>\"That's being a person for others by just being yourself,\" <a href=\"https://www.luc.edu/aboutsisterjean/\" target=\"_blank\">Sister Jean once said</a>. \"That's the way I am. I have to be myself. I tell students that -- you'll see people that you admire, you can do some of the things they do, but you have to be yourself. God made you the person who you are.\"</p>\n            </div>",

The origin story of how Pochettino reassembled the USMNT in a mold all his own, though, arguably began in March in the Los Angeles suburbs when <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/usmnt-admit-they-need-to-play-in-different-way-as-concacaf-nations-league-losses-inspire-world-cup-concerns/\">two crushing defeats at the Concacaf Nations League</a> forced a wake-up call.</p><p>\"That was a time to assess, to see and the moment that we identified the problems,\" Pochettino said on Thursday in the build-up to Friday's friendly against <span>Ecuador</span>. \"We start to destroy the things we need to destroy and start to build the house from the ground up.\"</p><p>Those losses to Panama and Canada offered the most notable series of trials and tribulations in Pochettino's first year on the job but seven months on, it also laid the foundation of the USMNT's proverbial house. This month's friendlies, which includes a test against <span>Australia</span> on Tuesday, mark the first time Pochettino will work with a first-choice squad after a year's worth of player pool expansion, a healthy mix of mainstays and fresh faces. There are 12 players in camp that were not part of the 2024 Copa America roster, the last assembled by Pochettino's predecessor Gregg Berhalter before he was fired following the USMNT's group stage exit, many of whom have a realistic shot of making the World Cup roster next summer. Even those who earned call-ups under Berhalter, though, have been afforded a new lease on national team life – that's certainly the case for midfielder Malik Tillman, who is back with the group for the first time since a breakout showing during last summer's Concacaf Gold Cup.</p><p>\"Maybe in the past, I didn't have the opportunities to play as much as I do now,\" Tillman said. \"It's just <span>nice</span> to be a part of the team.\"</p>\n<p>To some degree, the players that make up this month's roster can be considered the frontrunners for spots on the World Cup squad but the audition phase will continue for at least another match. Attackers <span>Christian Pulisic</span> and Alex Zendejas did not train on Thursday and the same goes for defender <span>Antonee Robinson</span>, their status unclear for Friday's game against Ecuador, while midfielder <span>Tyler Adams</span> will sit out this month's matches while he and his wife await the birth of their second child. The situation may be imperfect but it fosters a new round of opportunity for those willing and able to make an impression, much as Tillman did over the summer.</p><p>\"It's a team sport so I think we always have this next man up type mindset,\" defender <span>Chris Richards</span> said. \"We love Tyler, we miss Tyler but somebody's got to pick up his spot while he's not here and it's also their chance to earn a starting spot when he is here so that's kind of how we've all looked at it. If you're not in camp, regardless of what the reason is, it's another guy's chance to earn a spot and it's going to be very competitive.\"</p><p>Pochettino's USMNT also comes with a newfound tactical flexibility, as last month's matches against South Korea and <span>Japan</span> demonstrated. The head coach debuted a back three in the second half of a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/usmnt-vs-south-korea-score-live-updates-as-usa-soccer-aim-to-create-positive-vibes-ahead-of-world-cup/live/\">2-0 loss to South Korea</a> and used it again in a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/usmnt-vs-japan-score-usa-soccer-get-much-needed-win-record-shutout-against-fifas-17th-ranked-team/live/\">2-0 win over a rotated Japan team</a>, a long-awaited sign of progress after a string of unencouraging defeats.</p>\n<p>\"Different opponents, you're going to need different kind of solutions but I think being able to play different formations, having guys who have different styles of play is going to make us unpredictable when it comes to big teams,\" Richards said. \"Hopefully we can throw a few teams off their game with the different qualities that different guys bring.\"</p><p>The tactical evolution was a long time coming but Pochettino defended the amount of time it took to get the team moving in the right direction, describing it partially as a construct of the international schedule that forces coaches to work with players intermittently rather than day in and day out.</p><p>\"I think it's really important when you arrive at a new project, [you have] to let the people act in a very natural way and then see what is going on and to process the situation, to make the decisions that can hep, to build in a different way, to act, to behave and [in] the end, to perform,\" Pochettino said. \"March [was] the last possibility to see not only all the players but the staff and the federation, [the behaviors] that we need to change and sometimes you say, okay, that was really a wake-up call because I think [it] showed that why we were contracted, why they called us because Houston, we have a problem. We realize, I think that was the pin drop and we saw all, with all the information. I think from then, we started to work in a very intense way with the federation and try to change things that didn't help.\"</p>\n<p>Even if the World Cup is approaching rapidly, the result may still be secondary for a USMNT that is still putting together the puzzle pieces for what they hope is an impressive showing on home soil next summer. The subtle details of a cohesive performance will be the priority this month, a sensible area of focus against the latest in a string of friendlies against opponents ranked inside FIFA's top 30.</p><p>The areas of focus, as Tillman described them, were \"getting closer connections, finding combinations on the pitch, having good relationships, obviously fighting for each other, being there for each other.\"</p><p>Even as Pochettino's USMNT remain a work in progress, though, the head coach cannot help but reflect on the greatest sign of improvement – a sense of competition that was once missing from the one-note team Berhalter left behind.</p>\n<p>\"The message to the other players,\" Pochettino said, \"[is] that we are watching everything. We are seeing everything and of course, that roster is not the final roster. it's open. It's really open for everyone. They need to perform.\"</p><p>Pochettino name-dropped <span>Sebastian Berhalter</span>, a central figure during the USMNT's run to the Gold Cup final but not a member of this month's roster as a prime example of someone who is still in the race. He scored a brace in the <span>Vancouver Whitecaps</span>' 4-1 win over the <span>San Jose Earthquakes</span> on Sunday, and though he said it was a \"football decision\" to leave him off the roster this time, \"this type of performance makes us to say maybe next time with us, but that is how you force the players that are here, seeing that type of behavior, attitude or performance, to improve.\"</p><p>\"I promise you, no one is sure that he's going to be on the roster on the World Cup 2026. I don't believe before it was the same way or not and today, I promise all the guys feel that they need to fight to be there and that is priceless because all feel that need to be invited, they need to go out of their comfortable zone and when you are out of your comfortable zone, only you can improve … It is one of the things that we changed in one year.\"</p>\n            </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYG/new-york-giants/\">New York Giants</a> registered a statement victory on Thursday night, defeating the reigning <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> champion <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Philadelphia Eagles</a>, 34-17. The Giants pulled off this massive upset on the backs of their second and fourth picks in the 2025 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/\">NFL Draft</a>: Quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26694019/jaxson-dart/\">Jaxson Dart</a> and running back <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26697012/cam-skattebo/\">Cam Skattebo</a>. </p><p>In his third <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> start, Dart completed 17 of 25 passes for 195 yards and one touchdown, and rushed for 58 yards and another score. Skattebo was a monster on the ground all game, rushing 19 times for 98 yards and a whopping three touchdowns. He also caught two passes for 12 yards.</p><p>Dart and Skattebo were the second rookie quarterback-running back duo to record 50 rushing yards and a touchdown apiece in a game since 1970, following in the footsteps of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1620788/robert-griffin-iii/\">Robert Griffin III</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1254119/alfred-morris/\">Alfred Morris</a>, and the first Giants rookie duo to each register rushing touchdowns since Larry Heater and Leon Perry in 1980. </p><p>What else did these two star rookies accomplish? Well, with the help of CBS Sports Research department, let's take a deeper dive into the numbers and uncover some wild facts while we play a little game, shall we? </p>\n<h3>True or false: Did Jaxson Dart join Jalen Hurts and Lamar Jackson?</h3>\n<p>Dart has really made an impact with his legs through three starts, rushing for at least 54 yards in each contest. The Ole Miss product is actually just the third quarterback since 1950 to record 50 yards rushing in his first three starts. The other two were <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2240246/jalen-hurts/\">Jalen Hurts</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2181169/lamar-jackson/\">Lamar Jackson</a>. So that's true.</p><p>If you're wondering if a rookie quarterback has ever defeated the reigning Super Bowl champions before, the answer is yes. Although, this is the first time since 2010. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/584648/colt-mccoy/\">Colt McCoy</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1245430/max-hall/\">Max Hall</a> defeated the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NO/new-orleans-saints/\">New Orleans Saints</a> in 2010, Ed Rubbert defeated the Giants in 1987 and Cliff Olander defeated the Oakland <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LV/las-vegas-raiders/\">Raiders</a> in 1977. </p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2179245/daniel-jones/\">Daniel Jones</a>, Colt McCoy, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1630353/mike-glennon/\">Mike Glennon</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2803326/jake-fromm/\">Jake Fromm</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2061379/davis-webb/\">Davis Webb</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2865426/tommy-devito/\">Tommy DeVito</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1243338/tyrod-taylor/\">Tyrod Taylor</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2185479/drew-lock/\">Drew Lock</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1272242/russell-wilson/\">Russell Wilson</a>. These were the quarterbacks that started for the Giants following the retirement of Eli Manning. These were a long, dark five years, but it appears the Giants may have found a franchise quarterback.</p>\n<h3>True or false: Did Cam Skattebo top Odell Beckham Jr.?</h3>\n<p>Skattebo is not the fastest running back in the world nor the biggest, but he may be the most competitive. And definitely the most entertaining. He's quickly becoming a fan favorite, and not just among Giants fans. He runs like he wants to hurt would-be tacklers, and is a bowling ball that desperately wants to reach the end zone so he can do backflips.</p><p>The No. 105 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft is just the second rookie since 1970 to rack up 100 scrimmage yards vs. the reigning Super Bowl champions, joining <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2079567/kareem-hunt/\">Kareem Hunt</a> in 2017. He's the first Giants rookie to rush for three touchdowns in a single game since Charlie Evans in 1971, and the first NFL rookie since <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2960976/antonio-gibson/\">Antonio Gibson</a> in 2020 to do so. </p><p>Skattebo is the fourth player since 2000 to have 300 rushing yards, 100 receiving yards and five rushing touchdowns in their first six career games. He actually has more scrimmage yards than <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1824823/odell-beckham-jr/\">Odell Beckham Jr</a>. did in his first six career games. So this is true as well. </p>\n            </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>CHICAGO — <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/UCLA/ucla-bruins/\">UCLA</a> coach Mick Cronin is in the middle of a soliloquy Thursday at Big Ten Media Days describing his new big man, Michigan State transfer <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/29242259/xavier-booker/\">Xavier Booker</a>, when he does something he's really adept at: steering the conversation.</p><p>\"When you're 6-foot-11, if (Booker) has a good year, he'll be drafted,\" Cronin says matter-of-factly. \"Whether it's this year, next year … or his fifth year.\"</p><p>Those last four words loom large. Major uncertainty swirling around a potential pivot by the NCAA to allow players five seasons of eligibility in a five-season span — dubbed the \"5 in 5\" model — has forced some of college basketball's shakers-and-movers into a bit of an uneasy holding pattern. </p><p>The change seems inevitable, but the timing of when a new policy would take effect is unknown.  </p>\n<p>Some college basketball coaches believe it could be enacted as soon as this month, partially to get football staffs and players on the same page ahead of the lone transfer portal window in early January, but other high-major executives have pushed back against that aggressive timeline.</p><p>NCAA rule changes notoriously take forever to get off the mat through a mountain of red tape — but numerous Big Ten coaches reiterated that if it was going to happen for the 2025-26 season, it would have to be enacted … right about now. </p><p>\"The thing about it is you hear something different every week,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/NEB/nebraska-cornhuskers/\">Nebraska</a>'s Fred Hoiberg said. \"The last we heard, it's probably not going to happen this year, but it may happen in the future.\"</p>\n<p>If Hoiberg's intel is accurate, many seniors, including <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/PURDUE/purdue-boilermakers/\">Purdue</a>'s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/28954688/braden-smith/\">Braden Smith</a>, the <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/big-ten-basketball-preseason-media-poll-2025-26-purdue-michigan-state-overrated-indiana-underrated/\" target=\"_blank\">Big Ten Preseason Player of the Year</a></span>, won't have the option to return for a fifth season. Of course, Smith would love nothing more than to become a no-doubt, NBA Draft pick next summer, but if that did not coalesce, a fifth year of college basketball would provide a lucrative, high-profile backup plan. </p><p>It's not just Smith in the senior-laden Big Ten. New UCLA point guard <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/28953005/donovan-dent/\">Donovan Dent</a> -- another preseason All-American selection -- would exhaust his eligibility next March (or April, if things go according to plan for the Bruins), but if the status quo got shifted, there are enormous ripple effects on roster-building, recruiting and specifically, incoming freshmen.</p><p>\"My feeling is that it doesn't happen this year, unless it happens quickly,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/MINN/minnesota-golden-gophers/\">Minnesota</a>'s Niko Medved said. \"My sense is that it'd have to do it before football season ends for this class. If you try to do it retroactively later, that might cause some challenges. I don't know, but my sense is next year would be the earliest. How you plan around that? It's the unknown. Whether we like it or not, when that happens, you'll probably have to think more and more about how many high school players you have to sign.\"</p>\n<p>And for now, there are more questions than answers.</p><p>\"I think it would change things dramatically,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/MD/maryland-terrapins/\">Maryland</a>'s Buzz Williams said. \"I think this is the first season since COVID that we do not COVID eligibility players competing, right? And so, if the rule took place and was voted on today, I think any coach would want to know, 'Does that apply to the team that I have?' Because that would dictate who I should or shouldn't be recruiting now.\"</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/big-ten-basketball-preseason-media-poll-2025-26-purdue-michigan-state-overrated-indiana-underrated/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Big Ten basketball preseason media poll 2025-26: Purdue, Michigan State overrated; Indiana underrated</p>\n                <p>\n                    Cameron Salerno                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Big Ten basketball preseason media poll 2025-26: Purdue, Michigan State overrated; Indiana underrated\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/09/7b3f59af-fe55-4267-8b93-05efdf05a8fc/thumbnail/270x152/47ccf6ea1a58432dfd3cef4bf06670d2/untitled-design-37.png\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h2>Pros and cons of 5-in-5 model</h2><p>The premise of five years to play five seasons with no redshirts, fewer waivers and eligibility lawsuits is extremely attractive to some. The free COVID year helped former mid-major products like Chaz Lanier or Dalton Knecht completely elevate their profile from deep sleepers into household names and future <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nba/draft/\">NBA Draft</a> selections. Older players could lead to an even better product on the floor.</p><p>Plus, having a steadfast rule is a bit more attractive than the ever-changing rollercoaster that is eligibility waivers.</p>\n<p>\"That's one of the things that would be even for all of us,\" Michigan State's Tom Izzo said. \"Some of these other things are not even of us. I do know that it's really important to me that we keep this game with some integrity in it, and I'm struggling with that a little bit. Rules that are the same for everyone? I'm cool with.\"</p><p>But redshirting in college basketball is nothing like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football</a>, where one can stay under the four-game threshold and bank a year for later.</p><p>\"You get two scrimmages to figure out if you're going to redshirt somebody and then they can't play again,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/IOWA/iowa-hawkeyes/\">Iowa</a> coach Ben McCollum says. \"It just doesn't make any sense.\"</p>\n<p>Under the new proposal, redshirting as we know it would not exist. That's something Purdue's Matt Painter bristles at a tad because very few programs utilize the redshirt strategy as well as the Boilermakers. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/26779112/trey-kaufman-renn/\">Trey Kaufman-Renn</a> has transformed into an All-American candidate after sitting out back in 2021-22.</p><p>\"I'm not a big fan of it, but I also would like to stick be in the room for whoever's pushing it, to hear what they have to say why it's best for college basketball,\" Purdue's Matt Painter said. \"If you go '5 for 5' and that guy can play, but his first year, he doesn't play, we're opening up the can of worms to leave. And I don't like giving them more opportunities to leave. </p><p>\"I want to give them more opportunities to stay and grow and develop as a group, because that's why we're in a really good position right now. It doesn't mean we win our league.  It doesn't mean we go to a Final Four, but we're in a really good position because our three best players have all stuck together and grown together and had success together. It doesn't mean we don't have other good players in our team because we do, but that's our nucleus.  I just don't like rules that stop you from growing a team together instead of, you know, trading baseball cards.\"</p>\n<h2>'It's not going to change Cooper Flagg'</h2><p>Thanks to NCAA rule changes allowing players to earn money using their name, image and likeness, how college basketball coaching staffs recruit freshmen has changed significantly in the last few years, but a \"5 in 5\" change could turn it on its head with an entire extra batch of 23-year-old veterans understandably being in high demand and sopping up available spots. </p><p>\"It's not going to change Cooper Flagg,\" Medved says with a chuckle. \"Cooper Flagg would have been the No. 1 pick in the draft whether he went to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/DUKE/duke-blue-devils/\">Duke</a> or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/DELST/delaware-state-hornets/\">Delaware State</a>. But a lot of these guys, the decisions that they make earlier on in their careers is going to have a huge impact on them playing at the next level. </p><p>\"So it's not just for us, it's for them too. Where can I grow? Where can I develop? Where do I get the opportunity to showcase what I can do? Where do I play through the ups and downs? And so I think it's going to be a major change for us, but also for a lot of these prospects and the people around them and the decisions that they make out of high school.\"</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the writing is on the wall. Some high school seniors will be squeezed out and forced to go an alternative route (think junior college, Division II or low-major Division I, like Delaware State). The elite teams will likely have a mix of the best freshmen and a handful of fifth-year veterans. When do we get there? And how do you allocate the resources to prepare for it? That's the (multi) million-dollar question.</p><p>\"I mean, I love coaching older guys, so it would be fun,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/MICH/michigan-wolverines/\">Michigan</a>'s Dusty May says. \"I just worry that then it's going to be 6 for 6 and 7 for 7. What's the right cutoff to not be on a college campus? I don't know.\"</p><p>Neither does anyone else.</p>\n            </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>On Friday, the United States will host Ecuador in Austin, Texas, with a chance to put together a small winning streak. As the World Cup draws closer, Mauricio Pochettino is getting closer to figuring out his core squad, with players such as Antonee Robinson, Patrick Agyemang and Tanner Tessemann all making a return to the squad during this international break. There's room to improve, but there's also hope as a formation shift to a back three facing Japan helped lead to a win versus a (rotated) FIFA top 20 team.</p><p>In facing Ecuador, Pochettino will have another chance to lead the team to a signature win, but the attack will need to come into the tie prepared, as Ecuador have only allowed five goals in 18 matches played in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying. But here's how the USMNT can break through that defense.</p><h2>Keep the back three</h2><p>While it may not be the primary formation for the USMNT moving forward, with Tyler Adams out of the squad due to the expected birth of his child, taking a defense-first approach isn't a bad thing. Aidan Morris is back in the squad, and the Middlesbrough man may feature in midfield, but he is more of a box-to-box presence than a standard defensive midfielder. That's good to fit into the squad, but it's something that could work well next to Tessemann or Weston McKennie. With Robinson's return, while he may not be fit to play a full 90 minutes, he gives the USMNT a different dimension going both ways for the team.</p><p>Robinson has stated that he isn't 100% but this will be an opportunity for him to work with the national team and regain fitness. In his first appearance under Pochettino, Robinson operated as an inverted fullback, pushing the attack forward, and that's a role that could continue with Pochettino building from his fullbacks during his time in charge of the national team. Doing that can help balance the attack while also helping break down Ecuador's strong defense. Robinson stated that there hasn't been a discussion about how many minutes he will play during this camp, but any level of influence from the Fulham man will be much appreciated.</p>\n<h2>Ride the hot hand</h2><p>Rest during the summer may have paid off for Christian Pulisic, starting the season on a high note for Milan. Pulisic has six goals and two assists in only eight appearances, and that form translating to the national team will be critical to their success. Not training on Thursday, though Pochettino didn't say why, there is a chance that Pulisic won't start facing Ecuador, but that doesn't mean that he isn't a key player in the match if he's available. </p><p>Pulisic was able to grab his first goal contribution of 2025 for the USMNT with his assist against Japan, but he still seeks his first goal of the year for the USMNT. Robinson's return will also help Pulisic due to the left-hand side of the pitch returning to normal. With the World Cup closing in, it's important that Pochettino gets players who he views as his top options together as much as possible, and in the attack, players like Pulisic have separated themselves from the pack.</p><h2>Try new things</h2><p>It's important to win, but this is also a friendly where Pochettino can drop guys into a pressure cooker and see what happens. Mark McKenzie opened up on how Pochettino wants him to play like Tottenham defender Cristian Romero, so this is a good chance to see if that can happen. With the defense unsettled ahead of the World Cup, figuring out if a player like McKenzie -- who has had his moments with the USMNT but never looked settled -- can perform with pressure on the line is important. The same goes for midfield, where Pochettino can mix and match first-team players with guys like Morris who are looking to break through. Seeing players return from the 2022 World Cup squad to the USMNT is a good start, but for this team to advance past the round of 16, they'll need fresh faces to step up, and camps like this one are where Pochettino can figure out who he can really trust.</p>\n<h2>How to watch USMNT vs. Ecuador, odds</h2><ul><li><strong>Date</strong>: Friday, Oct. 10 | <strong>Time</strong>: 8:30 p.m. ET</li><li><strong>Location</strong>: Q2 Stadium -- Austin, Texas</li><li><strong>TV: </strong>TNT | <strong>Live stream: </strong>Fubo (<a href=\"http://www.fubo.tv/lp/soccer/?irad=356358&irmp=416484&sharedID=HTW\" target=\"_blank\">Try for free</a>)</li><li><strong>Odds: </strong>USMNT +125; Draw +220; Ecuador +230</li></ul><h2>Predicted XI</h2><p><strong>USA:</strong> Matt Freese, Antonee Robinson, Mark McKenzie, Tim Ream, Chris Richards, Alex Freeman, Weston McKennie, Aidan Morris, Tim Weah, Folarin Balogun, Christian Pulisic</p>\n            </div>",

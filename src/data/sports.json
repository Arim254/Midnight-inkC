    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        During the festive period, games coming left and right can lead to an injury pile-up, and that's just what the U.S. men's national team are experiencing without even participating in the games. American defender Chris Richards had to leave the EFL Cup quarterfinal with an injury as Crystal Palace drew 1-1 with Arsenal before being knocked out 8-7 in the penalty shootout that would follow. This comes after captain Tyler Adams tore his MCL and will be out for 2-3 months.Richards went down in the 73rd minute and had to be stretchered off for Palace before Arsenal forced an own goal via a shot from close range from Jurrien Timber as Maxence Lacroix scored what would seem like the game's only goal before another Palace center back got in on the action.\nDespite the result, all eyes will be on Richards. Coach Oliver Glasner said that Richards needed stitches on his foot, said he hopes it isn't too bad but did say he's not ruling him out for playing on New Year's Day. A key player for the Eagles as well as the United States men's national team, there is also the slight quirk of Richards being projected as a starter for the USMNT in a World Cup on home soil in 2026, and his place in the team is pivotal. A player who has captained the side at times under Mauricio Pochettino, Richards will be a critical part of the USMNT setup in an uncertain defensive pairing. Tim Ream has been starting next to Richards, but the Charlotte FC defender is 38, and if Pochettino opts for a back three, questions surround who would partner the duo during the World Cup.\nNow all eyes will be on the official severity of Richard's injury, though Glasner did not appeared too concerned, which is welcomed by the USMNT faithful. While the UMSNT won't play a game until March when they host Belgium and Portugal in Atlanta, Palace are right back at it hosting Tottenham on Dec. 28 and Fulham three days later on Jan. 1. With fourth through 10th in the Premier League only separated by five points, any time missed will push what manager Glasner is able to accomplish possibly jeopardizing what has been an excellent season so far. Richards is someone who will be needed with Palace still going in the FA Cup and the Europa Conference League while pushing for a top-four spot in the Premier League.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Alabama quarterback Ty Simpson remembers his last trip to the Rose Bowl with the Crimson Tide fondly. Two years ago, a few days prior to Alabama's loss to Michigan in the College Football Playoff semifinal, Simpson recalls meeting with then-coach Nick Saban about his plan for the rest of his career following two seasons as a backup.Simpson was eyeing a potential jump to the transfer portal before Saban changed his mind the only way he knew how.\"He said, 'I get it if you want to leave, but I know you, and I know what you wanted in recruiting. If you want to create value for yourself and you want to be a first-round draft pick, this could be a great story for you. You could leave a legacy here,'\" Simpson said, referring to Saban, on the 'Bussin' With The Boys' podcast this week. \"I thought about it, prayed about it, and said, you know what? You're right. And the next thing you know, he retires. I'm sitting there, and I'm like, he just lied to me\"But also as a coach's son, I understand. I understand what was going on. I understand how he thought about it. We had a good conversation about it, and to this day, we laugh about it.\"\nSaban announced his retirement from Alabama 10 days after the Crimson Tide's loss to the eventual-national champion Wolverines, but Simpson skipped an opportunity to leave to stay with the team.Crowned the starter this season as a fourth-year junior in Kalen DeBoer's second year, Simpson has thrown for 3,500 yards and 28 touchdowns entering next week's showdown with unbeaten and top-ranked Indiana.Simpson's first spring with DeBoer in 2024 was reassuring that he made the right decision to stick around following Saban's retirement. \n\"Just got to play ball. It was free. It was offensive-minded and not defensive-minded,\" Simpson said during the podcast episode published Tuesday. \"Honestly, it probably was better for my development in a sort of way, just because it wasn't -- honestly, because I could just play. The only reps that I got was some in a game, some in the South Florida game, but it was all defensive-minded reps. I had to prove to myself that I could actually play. I knew I could do it, whether it was in high school or practice, or during a game or a live-action scrimmage, I needed to prove to myself that I could.\"Coach DeBoer, that's all we did during the spring. 'Y'all just go play man. Just go do you.' Honestly, I took a huge step.\"Simpson's \"steps\" thereafter have led to first-round buzz for the 2026 NFL Draft as one of the nation's top prospects under center. And according to DraftKings Sportsbook's latest odds, Simpson is at +1800 to go No. 1 overall.\nEarlier this season, Simpson said he met with Saban before Alabama's opener to help ease some of the anxiety brought with the pressure of being the Crimson Tide's QB1. And after losing the game at Florida State, Simpson led Alabama to wins in 10 of its next 12 games prior to the SEC Championship loss to Georgia and a last weekend's first-round playoff victory at Oklahoma.\n            ",

The Under is 6-3 over WKU's last nine non-conference games, while it's 5-3 for the Golden Eagles when playing out-of-conference opponents.While both teams are projected to pile up heavy yardage, that doesn't necessarily mean lots of points due to the turnover factor.

    "description": "\n        While the Italian Serie A will be back on the weekend after the Christmas holidays, it's almost time to get into the 2026 winter transfer win",
    "body": "\n        While the Italian Serie A will be back on the weekend after the Christmas holidays, it's almost time to get into the 2026 winter transfer window. Most of the top Italian clubs are likely to explore options in the upcoming transfer window, especially given how difficult it usually is to find good opportunities in January. AC Milan have already secured a new striker, while Juventus need to find a solution for their striker in the new year, and Inter will look for a new right winger considering the injury and the contract situation of Denzel Dumfries. Let's take a look at five Christmas presents for five Serie A sides: AC Milan: The first signing of the windowAC Milan needed a striker as soon as possible and the Rossoneri have already signed Niclas Füllkrug from West Ham as the German player will be eligible to play the match against Cagliari on Jan. 2. Füllkrug joined the Rossoneri on loan with a $12 million buy option included in the deal, adding depth to the attacking unit coached by Massimiliano Allegri, which has been deeply affected by injuries in recent months. USMNT star Christian Pulisic, Rafael Leao, and Santiago Giménez have all dealt with fitness issues, with the Mexican striker in particular undergoing surgery in recent weeks and potentially leaving the club during the winter transfer window. AC Milan needed a central striker considering that Allegri is currently playing with two strikers, with Pulisic and Leao alternating with Christopher Nkunku, who joined AC Milan in the summer from Chelsea, and Füllkrug was the first and only option explored by the Italian club. AS Roma: Joshua Zirkzee back to Italy?While AC Milan signed a new striker before Christmas, AS Roma are also advancing in talks to sign Manchester United striker Joshua Zirkzee on loan until the end of the 2025-26 season, according to reports. The Giallorossi manager Gian Piero Gasperini expressed his concerns after the Juventus defeat over the last weekend regarding his attacking options, as both Evan Ferguson and Artem Dovbyk are not performing as he was hoping and needs a new striker to play alongside Paulo Dybala and Matias Soule. AS Roma, despite a promising start to the season under their new manager, have shown attacking struggles. They currently boast the best defense in Serie A but also share the worst attacking record among the top 10 teams alongside Lazio with 17 goals scored in 16 matches. This is why they need to improve their attacking options. \nInter: A new right wingerMeanwhile, Inter need a new right winger in 2026. This is why the future of the Dutch winger Denzel Dumfries is more than in doubt. Dumfries has a $25 million release clause valid in the summer and the expectation is that multiple European clubs will try to trigger it after the 2026 World Cup, where he's expected to be be one of the stars with the Netherlands. For that reason, Dumfries recently decided to change his agent, a move that often means that he's looking for either a new contract or a new club. On top of it, he's currently injured and after undergoing surgery on his ankle in London, and he will be out for at least two more months. In his absence, Luis Henrique, Carlos Augusto, and occasionally Andy Diouf will be tasked with filling the role. For this reason, should a good opportunity arise, Inter are likely to pursue a new signing in that role.Fiorentina: Happy with what you haveIf there is a team to watch in the next weeks, that's Fiorentina. The Viola are in a unprecedented and difficult situation as they are at the bottom of the Serie A standings with nine points and only one win in 16 matches. They are seriously risking getting relegated and have already replaced the manager, with Paolo Vanoli replacing Stefano Pioli earlier this season. This situation can lead some players to leave in the winter transfer window but Fiorentina need them to stay to avoid relegation. This is why the best Christmas gift for Fiorentina would be to keep all the best players at least until the summer. \nJuventus: A new contract for VlahovicLast but not least, Juventus need to solve the situation regarding their main striker in 2026. Dusan Vlahovic will be out of contract in the summer and there are now increasing chances to see him leaving as a free agent in 2026 unless something changes before then. Juventus struggled to find a solution last summer, failing to either sell him or reach an agreement on a new contract. There is no more time to lose; this is something they need to take care of as soon as possible, with the striker averaging 16.3 goals per season the last three campaigns. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The holiday break for colleges across the country offers an inflection point to deduce what we've learned and predict what's to come. For the past two seasons, I've started to separate college basketball's best players into various archetypes to better understand what they actually bring to the floor.Archetypes aren't set in stone for everyone, but we have settled on the following 10 buckets:Initiator point guard: They can score, but most importantly, they are on the floor to make others better. Think of the Hall of Famer, Chris Paul.Combo guard: These guards can play on or off the ball and do a little bit of everything offensively. Think about the king Walter Clayton Jr.Shooting guard: These guards are snipers. Their job is to hit 3s and create space for others using their gravity. Think of sweet-shooting Klay Thompson.True wing: These wings can do everything offensively, and the best ones can defend multiple positions. Think of the explosive Terrence Shannon Jr.Scorer/creator: These guys walk onto the floor trying to get buckets and can usually get 20 whenever they want. Think old friend Caleb Love. Off-ball wing/4: These wings can guard multiple positions, but they tend to have a smaller role offensively, usually operating as a spacer, cutter or play-finisher. Think Alex Karaban (spoiler!).Wing handler: These wings tend to be primary on-ball creators who can run pick-and-rolls or even do some backdowns. Think former Duke stud Cooper Flagg.Stretch 4/big: These bigs tend to play on the perimeter. They don't have to shoot 3-pointers, but it usually helps the offense when they can stretch the floor. Think ex-Villanova star Eric Dixon.Small-ball big: These bigs can guard multiple frontcourt positions easily and do a bunch of dirty work inside. They tend to have good, not great, measurables. Think Texas Tech's JT Toppin (spoiler, part two!).True 5: These centers tend to have excellent positional size and almost always defend opposing centers. Think of Creighton's All-Timer Ryan Kalkbrenner.So, which college basketball players are best at their position? We are not extrapolating out to NBA potential. This is simply factoring what we've seen through the first two months of the season and projecting what we will see over the next three-month sprint.Obviously, numerous players can fit in multiple different buckets, but we tried to find the role that they will most likely play for their respective teams. That means some buckets are more stocked than others. \nLet's dive in.Initiator point guard1. Braden Smith, Purdue: Smith is leading the country in dimes while shooting 42% from 3-point range. What else do you need to see? Purdue's version of CP3 keeps on chuggin'. 2. Bennett Stirtz, Iowa: You can nit-pick Stirtz's showings against razor-tough defenses like Iowa State or Michigan State, but overall, the Drake transfer has been excellent. He's shooting 42% from 3-point range and owns a 3-to-1 assist-to-turnover ratio. He is the sole creator for everything Iowa is doing these days. 3. Jaden Bradley, Arizona: Bradley is Arizona's bulldog leader. He is a torrid on-ball defender who has refined his offensive craft and is ice-cold in the clutch. \n4. Tamin Lipsey, Iowa State: Lipsey looks healthy and that's a massive boon for this Iowa State club. His burst is back which helps him collapse defenses and create advantages left and right. Lipsey has totaled 52 assists to just six turnovers. That's ludicrous. Oh, and he brings his hard hat on the defensive end every single night.5. Christian Anderson, Texas Tech: Anderson has shifted into the go-to handler and has utterly thrived in every way. He is a net-shredder from downtown, and the decision-making in pick-and-rolls is on point. No player is averaging more points in ball screens than Anderson (9.3), and he's creating north of 42 points per game for Texas Tech. He is a joy to watch play basketball.Just missed the cut: Donovan Dent, UCLA; Kingston Flemings, Houston; Mikel Brown Jr., Louisville; Rob Wright, BYU; Jeremy Fears Jr., Michigan State\nCombo guard1. Labaron Philon, Alabama: Life is good for Philon, who sits eighth in Division I with 21.9 points per game. Philon's tight handle combined with his decisive first step help him slither his way to his spots at will. Philon makes this hard game look so easy.2. Bruce Thornton, Ohio State: It feels like a genuine miracle for opposing defenses when Thornton misses a jumper. He's shooting 48% on catch-and-shoot 3-pointers and 42% on pull-up treys. Oh, and he has 26 dimes to just seven turnovers in six games against high-major foes. He's been fantastic in every facet.3. Ja'Kobi Gillespie, Tennessee: Gillespie is carrying a heavy load for Tennessee as the primary creator who simultaneously doubles as the best off-movement shooter on the roster. He toggles between both roles so flawlessly. Gillespie is averaging 17.6 points and 5.7 assists with impressive efficiency in a less-than-ideal offensive ecosystem. \n4. John Blackwell, Wisconsin: Blackwell just shows up and does his job every night. He's averaging over 19 points with a steady diet of bulldozer drives, slick pull-ups and line-drive treys. Blackwell is built like a fire hydrant and plays like a freight train.5. Milos Uzan, Houston: Kingston Flemings has deservedly stolen some of the spotlight, but Uzan is so steady and reliable as a heady ball-screen navigator who can shift to an off-ball role in a flash. Uzan got on a midseason heater in Big 12 play last year and another burner seems imminent for one of the best teams in the country.Just missed the cut: Keaton Wagler, Illinois; Kylan Boswell, Illinois; Tyler Tanner, Vanderbilt; Jackson Shelstad, Oregon; Skyy Clark, Oregon\nShooting guard1. Ryan Conwell, Louisville: As expected, Conwell-to-Louisville has been a grand slam so far. He has been one of the most productive off-movement shooters, and he's added more layers to his offensive portfolio, especially as a confrontational driver. Conwell has been Louisville's best player, and he tops the ACC in triples (44 at a 39% clip).2. Emanuel Sharp, Houston: Sharp has married his 3-and-D game with more creation and an extra splash of rim pressure. He's turning into one of the Big 12's best guards, but the threat of Sharp's jumper still sets the stage for everything. Sharp has parking-lot range. He's up to 41% from 3-point range, even though every defensive gameplan starts with taking him out.3. Solo Ball, UConn: Ball has gotten better. That's terrifying. The 6-4 junior sniper hasn't been quite as red-hot from downtown yet, but he is automatic on elbow jumpers, and Ball is up to a career-best 60% at the rim. Once the barrage of triples start to fall at his normal levels, Ball's already-good numbers will skyrocket.\n4. Richie Saunders, BYU: Saunders may have the fastest release in the sport. The BYU veteran is a driller, and he's so dynamic attacking long closeouts. Saunders has to be so frustrating to defend because he never stops cutting.5. Fletcher Loyer, Purdue: Purdue is the sixth-best offensive-rebounding team in the country, which is helpful because Loyer is shooting roughly 99.99% on those second-chance, kickout treys. Just missed the cut: Aden Holloway, Alabama; Nijel Pack, Oklahoma; Braylon Mullins, UConn; Lamar Wilkerson, Indiana; Honor Huff, West Virginia\nBYU's AJ Dybantsa is off to a historic start. \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            True wing1. AJ Dybantsa, BYU: The BYU star freshman became the first Division I or NBA player in the last 30 seasons to have a calendar month averaging at least 25.0 points, 5.0 rebounds and 5.0 assists while shooting over 65% from the field for an undefeated club, per OptaSTATS. Is that good? That seems good. Dybantsa has been legitimately incredible in so many ways. He's an outstanding post-up weapon who doubles as an effective decision-maker in pick-and-rolls and a dynamic transition killer. He's up to 18 dunks, too. Dybantsa is firmly in the National Player of the Year chase with Duke's Cameron Boozer and Michigan's Yaxel Lendeborg.\n        \n            \n                College basketball rankings: AJ Dybantsa's historic game caps a December to remember for BYU's star  freshman\n                \n                    Gary Parrish                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n2. Chad Baker-Mazara, USC: Baker-Mazara has been ridiculously good as the fulcrum of USC's offense. The veteran is averaging career-best numbers across the board while maintaining the efficiency that helped him become one of the best role players. Baker-Mazara is averaging over 21 points as USC's No. 1 option, but he isn't afraid to whip some brazen passes into tight windows. Baker-Mazara's combination of size, shooting, playmaking and defense helps him positively impact the game at a high level.3. Andrej Stojakovic, Illinois: Stojakovic has been one of the best drivers in America. The Illinois wing is averaging 1.24 points per possession on 41 drives, per Synergy. Illinois uses Stojakovic to abuse any team that puts small guards on the floor, and his jolt of isolation bucket-getting adds a different dynamic to an Illinois offense that is up to No. 2 in the sport. \n4. Otega Oweh, Kentucky: Oweh's first-month struggles coincided with Kentucky's brutal first 10 games, but the senior wing is starting to round into form. With point guard Jaland Lowe back in the fold, Oweh is poised to play his best basketball, attacking those advantages that Lowe generates. Oweh is still a freight-train driver who stampedes into the paint at will. Big showings are imminent now that Oweh is playing his ideal role. 5. Cameron Carr, Baylor: Carr has been hanging on rims this year. Carr is up to 23 dunks in 11 games amidst a breakout season for Baylor. The dynamic 6-5 wing has been a dangerous shot-maker, who has started to make over-aggressive defenders pay with wise cuts. Carr is on the floor to fetch buckets at all times, and he wants nothing more than to put you on a poster.Just missed the cut: Juke Harris, Wake Forest; Karter Knox, Arkansas; Josh Dix, Creighton; Chase Ross, Marquette; Cade Tyson, Minnesota\nScorer/creator1. Darryn Peterson, Kansas: Peterson keeps his spot atop the scorer/creator category, even amidst an injury-riddled start. I'm not sure he's been 100% healthy one time this year, and yet, he pirouettes around defenders like they are invisible. The Kansas freshman owns such a pure jumper.2. Darius Acuff, Arkansas: Acuff is a flat-out problem. He has answers for every defense as either a scorer or a playmaker. He's up to a 41% assist rate with a minuscule 13.1 turnover rate in Arkansas' five games against high-major competition. Oh, and he's shooting over 43% from 3-point range, 58% on floaters and 63% at the rim. Acuff's blend of power and polish is dazzling.3. PJ Haggerty, Kansas State: Duke's Cameron Boozer, St. Thomas' Nolan Minessale and Haggerty are the only Division I players who are averaging over 22 points, four rebounds and four assists. Haggerty has given Kansas State all the production it asked for. However, we've docked him a tad because Kansas State is a disappointing 8-4 and Haggerty has managed just an 86.6 offensive rating in five games against top-100 competition.  4. Tahaad Pettiford, Auburn: Pettiford's profile screams positive regression. He's shooting just 23% on 34 catch-and-shoot treys, including a perplexing 2-for-13 showing on unguarded catch-and-shoot treys. You know that's not going to stick for much longer. Pettiford's still one of the best pull-up assassins in the country, and his herky-jerky drives and rim-rocking slams in transition are so captivating. 5. Josh Hubbard, Mississippi State: Hubbard is beat up, and Mississippi State isn't as talented as the last few seasons, but the junior guard just keeps showing up. Hubbard's assist rate has spiked, and he's still a walking, talking bucket. Hubbard was put on this earth to put the ball in the basket.Just missed the cut: Boogie Fland, Florida; Malik Thomas, Virginia; Jason Edwards, Providence; Markus Burton, Notre Dame; Des Claude, WashingtonOff-ball wing/41. Yaxel Lendeborg, Michigan: Lendeborg has changed from a small-ball 5-man at UAB to a menacing off-ball wing at Michigan. The pivot has helped Lendeborg erupt into one of the best players in the game. He's shooting 80% on 2-pointers (what!), 40% from 3-point range and 86% from the charity stripe. His stampede drives are impossible to corral, and Lendeborg's feel as a decision-maker shines for this loaded Michigan club. Every single stat for Lendeborg is absurd.2. Caleb Wilson, North Carolina: Wilson waltzes onto the floor expecting to make defenders utterly miserable. The power, athleticism, effort, joy and IQ that he brings to the game has been a breath of fresh air for North Carolina basketball. It's not always pretty, but Wilson is a walking double-double who makes this UNC defense hum. The Tar Heels have the No. 4-rated defense in America when Wilson is on the floor, holding opponents to a meager 90.1 offensive rating (points allowed per 100 possessions), according to Hoop Explorer.3. Thomas Haugh, Florida: Haugh is comfortably Florida's best player using a bunch of the same principles that helped him become an elite role player. He is a sharp cutter, rugged offensive rebounder, dynamic driver and confrontational defender. Haugh has a player-development path that everyone should want to emulate.4. Alex Karaban, UConn: Karaban is back to being the best version of himself now that UConn's point guard problems have been solved. Karaban is shooting 44% from 3-point range, along with his punctual cuts, rock-solid team defense and perceptive understanding of UConn's layered offense.5. Milan Momcilovic, Iowa State: Momcilovic's silky jumper has been dialed in so far. The Iowa State junior wing has the fourth-highest effective field goal percentage (74.3%) in the country. He's making … everything. Off-movement treys are bullseyes. Catch-and-shoot jumpers are automatic like a layup. He bounces off defenders to set up his Dirk-like fadeaway jumper. He's 18-for-20 at the charity stripe. Special shot-making.Just missed the cut: Nate Ament, Tennessee; Eric Dailey Jr., UCLA; Dillon Mitchell, St. John's;Tyler Nickel, Vanderbilt; Pryce Sandfort, NebraskaWing handler1. Keyshawn Hall, Auburn: Hall is playing his best basketball for the Tigers. The do-it-all forward has posted a sparkling 127.7 offensive rating and is the ultimate mismatch-hunter. He can shoot over you. He can drive around you. He can drive through you. He can post you up. Hall just has so much game and will be one of the SEC's premier scorers all season. (There will be no further questions about the defense at this time.)2. Darrion Williams, NC State: Williams has become the point forward that Wolfpack coach Will Wade uses in a ton of different ways. Williams' mid-post backdowns are a staple of a NC State offense that ranks 22nd nationally, and he can create mismatches all over the floor both as a screener or with inverted pick-and-rolls. Williams has also been much more assertive in transition hunting his jumper. He's stuffing the stat sheet and shooting over 41% from beyond the arc.3. Neoklis Avdalas, Virginia Tech: Avdalas has cemented his place as one of the premier international talents. He picked the Hokies to showcase that he can play on the ball, and sure enough, he's done just that. The 6-9 guard has a 29.0 assist rate, and he can switch into a three-level scorer when needed. He's been just what the doctor ordered to breathe life back into Virginia Tech basketball.4. Nick Martinelli, Northwestern: Martinelli is a wagon. Northwestern's senior forward is shooting over 65% on his patented \"flipper,\" and he's showcased an improved outside stroke. When Martinelli is making treys, you're in hot water. He's given Ohio State 32 points and Oklahoma State a 28-piece. He ranks second in the Big Ten in scoring, and that isn't a mirage. 5. LeJuan Watts, Texas Tech: Watts-to-Texas Tech took some time to coalesce, but the breakthrough is happening in real time. Watts gives Texas Tech a whole new gear with his post-ups, wraparound passes and better attention to detail defensively. Watts' top similarity score on KenPom is Darrion Williams ... the exact player he was brought in to replace.Just missed the cut: Bryce Hopkins, St. John's; Mark Mitchell, Missouri; Tucker DeVries, Indiana; Dailyn Swain, Texas; Mo Dioubate, KentuckyDuke's Cameron Boozer has somehow been even better than advertised. \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Stretch 4/big1. Cameron Boozer, Duke: Boozer is college basketball's version of Thanos. Just inevitable. Even if the best defenses have him bottled up for 15 minutes, he still manages to put his imprint on the game. Boozer is averaging 23.3 points, 10.0 rebounds and 4.0 assists. Good things just happen for Duke when he's on the floor because he doesn't turn it over, he generates second-chance opportunities, he welcomes double-teams and he can score inside and out. Finishing at the rim through length has been the lone detractor throughout an objectively brilliant start to his college basketball career. Don't overlook how rare it is to know that Boozer will produce every single night. He takes no days off.2. Josh Jefferson, Iowa State: Jefferson looks like an NBA player just toying with college defenses. Jefferson leads all frontcourt players in assists (5.0 per game). His vision, manipulation and feel is so apparent. And then you add in his big-boy drives and added confidence in his jumper? Oh, and he plays defense? It's no coincidence that winning follows Jefferson wherever he goes.3. Koa Peat, Arizona: Peat is a hammerhead shark playing basketball. He doesn't go around defenders. He goes through them and will obliterate anybody in his path with powerful drives. Peat's basketball IQ is obvious. His secondary playmaking, including those push-ahead passes in transition, has been a nice weapon for an Arizona offense that loves to score in transition and dominate at the rim. Peat has become one of the best freshmen in America because he's tough, strong and dependable.4. Jaxon Kohler, Michigan State: Kohler is up to seven double-doubles in 12 games, and he's doing it with an inside-out game that's hard to handle. Kohler's already made as many treys (19) in a dozen games this season as he did in 37 contests a year ago. He's just gotten better and better throughout his tenure at Michigan State, and the 6-10, 245-pound big man also doubles as one of the Spartans' emotional leaders. He brings an edge and a tenacity to the floor that every good team desperately needs.5. Tyler Bilodeau, UCLA: The 6-9 big man can face up and drain contested midranges in his sleep. He's also buried 45% of his 3-pointers this season, and he's just living at the charity stripe. Bilodeau gives UCLA's offense real versatility as a pick-and-pop threat or as a post-up hub. Just missed the cut: Thijs de Ridder, Virginia; Donnie Freeman, Syracuse; Robbie Avila, Saint Louis; David Mirkovic, Illinois; Baba Miller, Cincinnati\n        \n            \n                Texas Tech shocks Duke: No. 19 Red Raiders upset No. 3 Blue Devils, handing them their first loss of season\n                \n                    Isaac Trotter                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSmall-ball big1. JT Toppin, Texas Tech: Toppin is automatic in the middle of the floor. When he can get to his left hand inside 10 feet, you're at his mercy. Toppin is one of the premier short-roll scorers in the country, and even though he has a massive offensive role, Toppin still has the energy to batter teams on the offensive glass. He's also been one of Texas Tech's best defenders at every level. The dude is a warrior.2. Trey Kaufman-Renn, Purdue: Kaufman-Renn's touch in the paint is as good as anyone in the country. He makes floaters, runners and hooks at an exceptional level. The Braden Smith-Kaufman-Renn two-man game is one of the unstoppable actions in college basketball, and TKR has turned it up on the glass. He ranks seventh in the nation in offensive-rebound rate. 3. Rienk Mast, Nebraska: A healthy Mast is a big ole problem. Mast is shooting over 40% from 3-point range on 57 attempts, and he owns a feathery touch on his hook shots. The passing is terrific, and he has the IQ to terrorize whatever matchup is thrown at him.4. Jayden Quaintance, Kentucky: If healthy, Quaintance will be one of the best defenders to ever wear a Kentucky uniform. Think about that? Quaintance is an enforcer in the paint who shadows guards on the perimeter without breaking a sweat. He is an utter game-changer for the 'Cats.5. Zuby Ejiofor, St. John's: Ejiofor makes a living playing harder than everyone. He's not the biggest (6-9, 240) nor the most skilled, but he's a complete warrior whose motor never turns off. Ejiofor is one of the elite switch-everything defenders who can guard all five positions well, and he's almost impossible to box out. Any frontcourt with an ounce of softness gets vaporized by Ejiofor.Just missed the cut: Hannes Steinbach, Washington; Braden Huff, Gonzaga; Morez Johnson, Michigan; Alex Condon, Florida; JoJo Tugler, HoustonOregon's Nate Bittle impacts the game in every facet. \n                                                                    Imagn Images\n                                                            True 51. Nate Bittle, Oregon: Oregon has been underwhelming, but it's not Bittle's fault. When healthy, the 7-footer is ridiculously impactful as a pick-and-pop big man who can score on the block, pass, protect the rim and handle the boards. Bittle showed his entire bag in Sunday's 28-point, nine-rebound, five-assist, four-block showing against Gonzaga.2. Henri Veesaar, UNC: Veesaar's game is so additive and you feel his impact every time UNC plays. He's an integral part of a top-20 UNC defense, and the 7-footer makes the Tar Heels' offense work. Veesaar has drained 17 3-pointers and flashed an improved back-to-the-basket game in addition to his yeoman's work on the offensive glass. He's averaging 16.9 points, 9.2 rebounds and 2.0 assists. That's everything UNC could have wanted and then some when it made the big free agency splash.3. Aday Mara, Michigan: Opponents are shooting just 38% at the rim against Michigan when Mara is on the floor. The 7-3 center is a special shot-blocker and becomes a one-man rim deterrent, forcing opponents to just try and make jumpers because they're terrified to enter the paint. Mara doubles as an excellent post-up hub for this Michigan offense, too. He is a special role player.4. Graham Ike, Gonzaga: Ike's offensive production is impossible to ignore. He is a straight bucket who could eclipse 2,500 career points by March. Ike carves out space in the paint unlike any other, and he's getting better and better as a decision-maker. When Ike is knifing down the paint, you'd best get out of the way.5. Patrick Ngongba, Duke: Ngongba has settled in as Duke's second-best player behind Boozer. It's not always perfect, but the sophomore big man has rapidly improved as a back-line rim protector who can sniff out advantages and turn the water off as a shot-blocker. Opponents shoot just 47% at the rim when Ngongba is on the floor. It spikes to 58% when he sits, per Hoop Explorer. Ngongba also provides Duke's offense some real optionality because he can shoot it, deck it and pass it. \n            ",

Houston has hit a rough stretch as it is just 1-5 against the spread over its last six. One of those was failing to cover versus the Clippers when these teams met on Dec. 11, as L.A. has covered in both of its 2025 games against Houston. Additionally, the Rockets have dropped five of their last six ATS on the road.Houston's lack of a true point guard is evident by it averaging the second-most turnovers (16.3), and it's been especially careless with the ball as of late. The Rockets are averaging 18.8 turnovers over their last eight games, and the Clippers are undefeated versus the spread (3-0) when forcing more than 16 turnovers.

    "body": "\n        Eight 2025-26 college football bowl games and four playoff matchup are in the books, but some bowl confidence pools remain open for entries or modifications as there are more than 30 matchups remaining to make college football bowl picks on before the curtain closes on this season. The biggest remaining college football spread has Utah as a 15.5-point favorite over Nebraska in the Las Vegas Bowl on Wednesday, Dec. 31. While putting faith in big favorites is a part of just about everyone's college football bowl confidence strategy, correctly predicting a couple upsets can give you a big edge in any football pools. Anticipated matchups outside of the CFP include Penn State vs. Clemson (-3), Vanderbilt (-5.5) vs. Iowa, Georgia Tech vs. BYU (-4.5), Tennessee vs. Illinois (+2.5) and Michigan vs. Texas (-7.5). Before making any college football predictions for bowl season, be sure to see the latest college football bowl confidence picks from SportsLine's proven model.New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $75 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times, and it is 31-19 on its top-rated college football money-line picks since the beginning of the 2024 season. Now, it has turned its attention to the latest college football odds and 2025-26 bowl season college football betting for confidence pools. Head here to see every pick. New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Top 2025-26 college football bowl confidence picks  One of the model's most confident picks is that No. 16 USC (-6.5), who will have quarterback Jayden Maiava, gets a comfortable win over TCU in the Alamo Bowl on Dec. 30. USC went 9-3 in the regular season, with all three defeats coming versus ranked teams. TCU found itself in the Top 25 once -- back in September -- before having a pedestrian run through the Big 12 schedule, finishing 5-4. Even with the Horned Frogs playing in the easier conference than the Trojans, USC both averaged more points and allowed fewer points per game. USC sports a 32-9 (78%) straight-up record when favored since Lincoln Riley came aboard in 2022, as it is projected to easily take care of business in San Antonio. SportsLine's model has the Trojans prevailing 70% of the time. See all of the model's college football bowl confidence picks here.Another one of the bowl confidence predictions the model is high on: Northwestern (-10.5) handles Central Michigan in the GameAbove Sports Bowl on Dec. 26. Central Michigan struggled mightily against Power 4 opponents this year, losing 63-3 to Michigan and 45-17 to Pittsburgh. Northwestern went just 6-6 this year, but that was largely thanks to a very tough Big Ten schedule that included Oregon, Michigan, USC and Illinois. For comparison, Northwestern lost to Michigan by two points on a last-second field goal. The model has Northwestern winning nearly 80% of the time, making the Wildcats the clear side to back. See the rest of the college football bowl confidence predictions here. How to make college football bowl confidence picksThe model has also made the call on who wins every other bowl game. There are 11 teams that win at least 70% of the time, so you need to go big on those matchups, as well as 15 underdogs that win outright. You can get all the model's picks at SportsLine.So who wins every college football bowl game, and which matchups should you assign the most confidence points to?

    "body": "\n        Brooks Koepka, 35, announced Tuesday that he is leaving LIV Golf after serving as one of the Saudi Arabia-backed tour's signature faces since he signed with the organization ahead of its inaugural 2022 season. Koepka, a five-time major championship winner, did not hoist a trophy in 2025 for the first time in five years, finishing 31st in the league's individual standings.\"Brooks Koepka will be stepping away from LIV Golf,\" his representation said in a statement. \"... Family has always guided Brooks' decisions, and he feels this is the right moment to spend more time at home. Brooks will continue to be a huge supporter of LIV Golf and wishes the league and its players continued success. Brooks remains passionate about the game of golf and will keep fans updated on what's ahead.\"Kopeka, who spent 47 weeks as the No. 1 golfer in the world back in 2018, is a nine-time PGA Tour winner who has claimed two U.S. Opens (2017-18) and three PGA Championships (2018-19, 2023). He missed the cut at three of the four majors in 2025.Whether Koepka plans to return to the PGA Tour remains to be seen; however, there has been speculation that he could spend 2026 with his family before rejoining the organization in 2027. The PGA Tour currently has a one-year suspension in place for any golfer who participates in unauthorized events. LIV Golf tournaments fit into that category.Kopeka would also need to ensure he has playing status on the PGA Tour after being inactive since 2021. As a recent major winner, he may not need to go through lower qualifying rungs, though he would need to reapply for membership before facing any discipline.\n\"Brooks Koepka is a highly accomplished professional, and we wish him and his family continued success. The PGA Tour continues to offer the best professional golfers the most competitive, challenging and lucrative environment in which to pursue greatness,\" the league said.Much of the bad blood that developed between the PGA Tour and LIV Golf came with different leadership at the top of each organization.While CEO Brian Rolapp could attempt to convince the PGA Tour Board of Directors to roll back some of its policies and open its arms to a returning Koepka, many within the PGA Tour still hold ill will toward players who exited the league and broke apart the sport, believing LIV Golf offered greener pastures.\n\"We have amicably and mutually agreed that Brooks Koepka will no longer compete in the LIV Golf League, following the 2025 season,\" CEO Scott O'Neil said in a statement. \"Brooks is prioritizing the needs of his family and staying closer to home. We appreciate the significant impact he has had on the game and wish him continued success, both on and off the course.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\nIt wasn't long ago that the Los Angeles Rams repeating as NFC West champions seemed like a lock. But as the 2025 NFL season has proven time and again, situations can change in an instant.The Rams were rolling at 9-2 but squandered a fourth-quarter lead against the Carolina Panthers in Week 13 and dropped a 31-28 decision, ending their six-game winning streak. The Seattle Seahawks routed the Minnesota Vikings 26-0 that day to pull even with Los Angeles atop the division and both clubs won their next two contests, setting up a huge showdown in Week 16.Having already beaten the Seahawks at home in Week 11, the Rams could have taken a major step toward securing their 16th NFC West title by sweeping the season series. However, they let a 16-point lead with just over eight minutes remaining in the fourth quarter slip away and were unable to stop Seattle after beginning overtime with a touchdown, allowing the Seahawks to post a 38-37 victory and climb into the driver's seat in the division.Los Angeles (11-4) still can capture the NFC West crown -- and even the No. 1 seed in the conference -- but it first will need help this Sunday from either the Panthers or Chicago Bears -- or both. Carolina hosts Seattle (12-3) and Chicago visits the San Francisco 49ers (11-4), who own the tiebreaker with the Rams. If the Seahawks and 49ers both win their Week 17 matchups, it would render Los Angeles' meeting with the Atlanta Falcons (6-9) at 8:15 p.m. ET on Monday Night Football meaningless when it comes to the division title.\nHowever, the door would remain open for Los Angeles with a loss by at least one of its division rivals. The Rams then would need to defeat Atlanta -- as well as the Arizona Cardinals in their regular-season finale -- and have whichever team won in Week 17 lose in the Week 18 showdown between Seattle and San Francisco.It may seem like a tall order, but the Seahawks are on the road Sunday against a Carolina team that is battling the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for the NFC South title and the 49ers host a Chicago squad that may require a victory to clinch the NFC North and also is in contention for the No. 1 seed in the conference. With much at stake for both the Panthers and Bears, winning in Week 17 will be anything but an easy task for Seattle and San Francisco.On the other hand, while a win is never a given in the NFL, the Rams have a much easier job ahead of them. Atlanta has posted back-to-back victories after losing seven of its previous eight games, but one of those triumphs came against Arizona last week. That defeat was the seventh in a row and 12th in 13 contests for the Cardinals, who got off to a promising 2-0 start this season.Even if the Rams receive the help they need on Sunday, SportsLine's Inside the Lines team believes their outlook for a second straight NFC West title wouldn't improve a great deal with a victory on Monday Night Football. According to the ITL team's model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, Los Angeles currently has about a 22% chance to win the division, and it would only improve by around 10% with a triumph over Atlanta.CHANCES OF WINNING NFC WESTTEAMCURRENTWITH WEEK 17 WINWITH WEEK 17 LOSSDIFFERENCELos Angeles Rams22.1%32.4%0.0%32.4%Seattle Seahawks49.0%63.6%24.3%39.3%San Francisco 49ers28.9%44.9%7.0%37.9%The model also believes that the team that finishes first in the NFC West will be the top-seeded playoff team in the conference as well. CHANCES TO BE NO. 1 SEED IN NFCTEAMCURRENT ODDSSeattle Seahawks44.7%San Francisco 49ers25.1%Los Angeles Rams18.7%Chicago Bears11.3%Philadelphia Eagles0.1%The Rams pose a major problem for opposing defenses as they top the NFL in both total offense (396.7 yards) and scoring (30.5 points), rank second in passing (270.5 yards) and are fifth in rushing (126.3). They possess an aerial attack that is led by Matthew Stafford, who leads the league with 4,179 passing yards and 40 touchdown tosses, and includes wide receivers Davante Adams (first with 14 TD catches) and Puka Nacua (second with 1,592 receiving yards).Containing that trio is a tall order for any defense, even an Atlanta unit that is eighth in the NFL against the pass (195.1 yards allowed). The Rams own a 49-28-2 all-time record against the Falcons in the regular season and won the last two meetings between the teams, including a 31-27 home triumph in 2022 in which Stafford threw for 272 yards and three touchdowns.Los Angeles, which still has the No. 5 seed in the conference for which to play should the NFC West title and top seed be out of the question, is a 7.5-point favorite against Atlanta in the latest NFL odds at DraftKings. The ITL team's model is predicting a 30-21 victory by the Rams, which would keep them alive in the race for the division crown should Seattle and/or San Francisco lose in Week 17.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The New York Jets placed quarterback Justin Fields on injured reserve Tuesday, ending his 2025 season and potentially his tenure with the franchise. Fields missed the last three games with a knee injury that coach Aaron Glenn said did not heal in a timely enough fashion for the signal-caller to return to the field this year.Fields started for the Jets for the majority of the season before ceding his job to Tyrod Taylor. The latter has been dealing with a pair of injuries of his own, which opened the door for Brady Cook to make back-to-back starts the last two weeks. Cook, an undrafted rookie, projects to remain in the lineup for Sunday's divisional game against the New England Patriots.While Fields was inactive for the last three games, he was designated last week as the Jets' emergency quarterback.\"We're gonna put Justin on IR,\" Glenn said. \"We tried to see how we can get this to work, but it wasn't getting as better as we would like it. We want to make sure we get a focus on that to make sure we get him better.\"\nFields said last week that he underwent an MRI on the injured knee and that the imaging revealed an issue that would keep him out on a \"week-to-week\" basis. The injury occurred in practice ahead of the Dec. 7 loss to the Miami Dolphins.The IR designation closes the book on Fields' season and leaves him with a 2-7 record as the Jets' starter. It was an up-and-down year for the former first-round pick wherein the lows were tremendously low and the high points were few and far between. Fields threw for fewer than 55 yards in four of his nine starts and in Week 2 against the Buffalo Bills completed just three of his 11 pass attempts in one of the worst games by an NFL quarterback this season.Although he threw just one interception on the year, Fields was highly inefficient in completing 62.7% of his passes for 1,259 yards. He did make an impact as a ballcarrier, though, rushing for 383 yards and four touchdowns.\nWill Justin Fields return to the Jets in 2026?Fields signed with the Jets last spring on a two-year, $40 million deal with $30 million guaranteed. While he remains under contract through 2026, it became clear this season that he is unlikely to be part of the team's long-term plans, and both sides could likely benefit from parting ways at the end of the year.Adding to the likelihood that Fields and the Jets break up before the 2026 season is the fact that New York will receive an early-first round draft pick and could use it on a quarterback. Unless they feel as though Cook could develop into a capable starter, the leader of their 2026 offense is probably not yet on their roster.The Jets would incur $22 million in dead cap space if they cut Fields after the season. Fields could command interest on the trade market as a backup, though, and still possesses upside as a potential post-hype breakout candidate in the right situation.\n            ",

    "body": "\nA division crown seemed like nothing but a dream for the Carolina Panthers after their disappointing start to the 2025 NFL season. With two games remaining on the schedule, the team has its NFC South title fate in its own hands.Carolina (8-7) was demolished 42-13 by the New England Patriots in Week 4 to fall to 1-3, and an eighth consecutive sub-.500 campaign was expected by most. But the Panthers defied the cynics in Dave Canales' second year as head coach and went on to win six of their next nine contests to thrust themselves right into the NFC South race.Their prospects were aided by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' downward spiral. In line for a fifth consecutive division title after a 6-2 start, Tampa Bay (7-8) floundered after returning from its bye, losing three straight before edging the Arizona Cardinals 20-17 in Week 13 to maintain a one-half game lead over Carolina.The Panthers had their bye the ensuing week and dropped a 20-17 decision to New Orleans upon their return, while the Buccaneers followed their victory with setbacks against New Orleans and the Atlanta Falcons, setting up a showdown between the 7-7 rivals in Charlotte in Week 16.The contest was a back-and-forth affair as the lead changed hands four times before Tampa Bay forged a 20-20 tie with a field goal early in the fourth quarter. But Carolina converted one of its own with 2:20 remaining and intercepted Baker Mayfield in Panthers territory with 49 seconds left to seal a 23-20 triumph and take sole possession of first place in the division.As a result, the Panthers could have their sixth NFC South title and first since 2015 in their pocket by late Sunday afternoon and make their rematch with the Buccaneers in the regular-season finale insignificant. It will be anything but easy, however, as Carolina hosts the conference-leading Seattle Seahawks (12-3), while Tampa Bay visits the downtrodden Miami Dolphins (6-9).\nShould the Panthers upset the Seahawks and the Buccaneers end their matchup against the Dolphins with either a tie or their seventh loss in eight games, Carolina will clinch an unforeseen division crown after secure its first winning record since going 11-5 in 2017. A tie by the Panthers, who entered this year with a total of seven victories over their previous two seasons, and loss by Tampa Bay also would put a bow on the NFC South.However, Seattle enters Week 17 with a winning streak that reached five games with a stunning 38-37 overtime triumph over the Los Angeles Rams last Thursday and the NFC West title in its sights. In addition, Carolina has won back-to-back games just once this season and hasn't accomplished the feat since posting three consecutive victories from Weeks 5-7.A meltdown such as the one Tampa Bay is experiencing could wind up costing head coach Todd Bowles his job should the team miss the postseason, regardless of the fact he had guided the Bucs to the division title in each of his first three years at the helm. But since the Dolphins have suffered double-digit losses in each of their last two outings after a four-game winning streak gave them false hope for a postseason berth, it's reasonable to think the Buccaneers will right the ship and defeat a rudderless Miami team that saw head coach Mike McDaniel, who likely will be fired at the end of the season, bench No. 1 quarterback Tua Tagovailoa prior to last week's 45-21 setback against the Cincinnati Bengals.\nConsidering the state of each club after Carolina's triumph last week, SportsLine's Inside the Lines team and its projection model currently give the Panthers the best chance to win the NFC South. But the ITL team's model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, believes Carolina and Tampa Bay's prospects are close to equal should both finish with the same result on Sunday.CHANCES OF WINNING NFC SOUTHTEAMCURRENTWITH WEEK 17 WINWITH WEEK 17 LOSSDIFFERENCECarolina Panthers53.5%62.6%32.5%30.1%Tampa Bay Buccaneers46.5%66.5%33.6%32.9%The Panthers are just 4-9 against the Seahawks in regular-season play and have lost four of their last five meetings, including a 37-27 defeat at Seattle in 2023 in which Kenneth Walker III ran for 97 yards and a pair of touchdowns for the home team. Carolina's defense will have to contend with a Seahawks squad that is third in the NFL in scoring (29.5 points) and sixth in passing offense (238.1 yards), thanks in large part to Sam Darnold, who ranks fifth in the league with 3,703 passing yards, and Jaxon Smith-Njigba, who leads all players with 1,637 receiving yards.Tampa Bay has won three straight and six of its last seven matchups against Miami after having lost four of the first five games in the all-time series. The Buccaneers' most recent victory over the Dolphins took place in 2021, when Mike Evans made six catches for 113 yards and hauled in two of the legendary Tom Brady's five touchdown passes in a 45-17 thrashing. Seattle is a 7-point favorite against Carolina in the latest NFL odds at DraftKings, and the model is predicting a 27-20 victory for the Seahawks. Meanwhile, the Buccaneers are 5.5-point favorites at the sportsbook in their matchup versus the Dolphins, with the ITL team's model calling for a 28-25 triumph by Tampa Bay. Those outcomes would set up a showdown between the Panthers and Bucs in Tampa for the NFC South title in Week 18, which is something no one could have seen coming when the season began.\n            ",

    "body": "\nWe're getting into the part of every season where we have to worry about motivation, and not just for teams out of the playoff race. Teams like the Eagles and potentially Steelers (if the Ravens lose on Saturday) will have to determine if they want to chase a slightly better seed or limit the risk of injury to key players over the final two weeks.The potential rest angle for certain teams allows us to play a few correlated parlays at this time of year. If the Ravens lose on Saturday, the Browns will certainly have a much better chance of beating the Steelers on Sunday, as starters could rest for some or all of the game. Throwing the Packers and Browns in a money line parlay should get you anywhere from +350 to +400, but you can also add the Bills for an additional potential rest angle.\nAnother potential correlated money line parlay involves the three NFC West teams, all of whom clinched a playoff berth in Week 16. The Rams' loss to the Seahawks could wind up being catastrophic as they may not even have a chance to play for a division title by Monday. If the favored Seahawks and 49ers both win their matchups, they'll be squaring off for the No. 1 seed in Week 18 and the Rams will have to consider resting starters for some or all of their game against the Falcons. Sean McVay has shown a preference for resting players in the past.Putting the Seahawks, 49ers and Falcons together in a money line parlay should get you even better odds than our previous parlay considering the Falcons are a massive underdog early in the week.\nI'll have several spread picks this week at SportsLine, where members are able to get access to all my picks throughout the week as they're made and hopefully take advantage of some good line value.Let's dive into our betting power ratings and highlight a few more teams of note.Week 17 power ratingsTeam1716151413LAR88767.5SEA6.566.566NE54443.5BUF54.54.54.54.5JAC53210SF4.53211PHI4.53244.5DEN44.52.51.52LAC41.5100HOU3.53.531.51DET33.54.53.55CHI2.51.5121GB1.5354.54PIT1.510-1.5-1.5BAL01.512.54TB0000-3CAR-1-2.5-2-2.5-4.5DAL-1.5022.51CIN-2-2.500-1.5ATL-3-3.5-3.5-3-3IND-3.5-4.5-52.55MIN-4.5-1-3-6-3NO-4.5-4.5-4.5-7-6.5TEN-5.5-8-8.5-9-8.5CLE-6-7.5-4.5-6-5.5ARI-6.5-4.5-3.5-2.5-3KC-7.5-2.52.556.5WAS-8-4.5-4.5-2.5-5.5NYG-8-5-3.5-4-2.5MIA-8.5-2.5-2-3.5-4LV-9-10-7-7-6NYJ-10   -9-8.5-7.5-7.5I'm still giving the Rams a clear edge over the Seahawks despite last week's result, which required an improbable fourth-quarter rally by Seattle just to send the game into overtime. The Rams might be on the road the entire playoffs and still wind up favored in every game.I have the Bills, Patriots and Jaguars grouped together in my second tier. Buffalo appears to have the weakest roster of the three overall, but the Bills also have the great equalizer at quarterback, and Josh Allen might run through the AFC playoffs winning games 41-38 if he has to. The Jaguars have done enough to be right alongside the best teams in the AFC after their dismantling of the Broncos, a team I finally started to believe in heading into last week. The Patriots may be getting a little bit of the benefit of the doubt, but they played well enough in their two games against Buffalo that I didn't want to have them slotted lower than the Bills.Next up comes the 49ers and Eagles, two teams that are getting healthier down the stretch and might be able to play up to their full potential in January. San Francisco is much like Buffalo with questions about the defense but an offense that is going to be hard to beat in a shootout, but I have enough confidence in the defense to make plays that I want to have them as clearly higher than the Lions, a team with a similar profile.The Broncos and Chargers slot in next, and I'm going to have a hard time not taking the Chargers in Week 18 with how hit or miss the Broncos have been this year. I'd play both over Houston, a much more hit-and-miss team that is hard to trust after an embarrassing effort against the Raiders.You could argue the Bears should be much higher than where I have them, behind a Lions team that is probably going to miss the playoffs, but they were down 10 at home with two minutes left to a team that lost its QB midgame. Kudos for pulling out the win, but with a point differential that sits 15th between the Chiefs and Steelers -- and I'm already putting Chicago ahead of Pittsburgh -- I don't know that I'm comfortable moving them much higher. That would certainly change if they can beat the 49ers in San Francisco.The ratings for the Ravens and Packers are up in the air with uncertainty around their QB situation, and I'm still putting the Bucs slightly ahead of the Panthers despite Carolina's win.Full Week 18 projected linesAwayHomeLookaheadConsensusPR SpreadNotesDALWAS+3.5+7+5Johnson expected for WASDETMIN+3.5+7+5.5Brosmer to start for MINDENKC+5.5+12.5+9.5Oladokun to start for KCHOULAC+1.5-2.5-1.5BALGB-3-2.5-3.5QB situation on both sides is fluidJACIND+5.5+6.5+7SEACAR+7.5+7.5+6ARICIN-5.5-7-6PITCLE+4.5+3.5+5PIT could rest players if BAL losesNOTEN+2+2.5-1NENYJ+9.5+13.5+12.5TBMIA+2.5+5.5+5.5NYGLV+3-1.5-0.5PHIBUF-3-1.5-3.5PHI could rest playersCHISF-2.5-3-4.5LAR   ATL   +8.5   +8+8   LAR could rest players if SEA, SF winThis is how I would set each game based on my power ratings and home-field advantage data for this week. A large discrepancy between the projected power rating lines and the market lines does not make the game an auto play, but it gives us a basis for potential strong picks pending further analysis.\n            ",

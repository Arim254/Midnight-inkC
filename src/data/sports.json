    "body": "\n        The 10th-ranked Miami (Fla.) Hurricanes will look to continue their unlikely run to the championship when they battle the sixth-ranked Ole Miss Rebels in a 2026 College Football Playoff semifinal matchup at the Fiesta Bowl on Thursday.

The Under has hit in nine of 14 Duke games this season, and the Under has cashed in three of the last four Louisville contests. Louisville guard Mikel Brown Jr., the team's second-leading scorer, is out with a back injury. Given these teams haven't gone Over this total head-to-head in 43 years and how often they've gone Under this season, the model projects the Under to hit in 60.7% of simulations. Back the Under at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Cavaliers (-5.5) vs. PacersThe Cavaliers haven't been as dominant this year as they were last year, but they have won three of their last four contests and are 5-3 over their last eight games. Donovan Mitchell (rest) is out for Cleveland, but the Cavaliers still have enough playmakers to comfortably defeat the Pacers, who are playing without Tyrese Haliburton from his torn Achilles in last year's playoffs. The Pacers are 6-30 this season and have lost 12 straight games. Ten of those losses came by at least six points, and they are 2-5 against the spread over their last seven contests.

The Michigan State coach gave Davis a \"what the f--- are you doing?\" before joining the official in pointing him to the exit. \nIzzo was clearly non-plussed by Davis' actions and discussed what happened with the media after the game. \n\"You know I love Paul Davis. I really do. He's one of my favorite guys,\" Izzo said. \"He's always calling and doing things. But what he said, he should never say anywhere in the world. And that ticked me off. So, just because it's 25, 20 years later, I'm going to have to call him tomorrow and tell him what I thought of it. And you know what he'll say? 'I screwed up, Coach. Sorry.'\"[Davis] kind of got after the official and he was 150 percent wrong,\" Izzo continued. \"And for a guy like me to 150 percent agree with the official, it's almost illegal. So I feel bad because he did that because he's been a guy that comes back a lot and we've got to keep him coming back. He made a mistake.\"\nDavis played center for Michigan State from 2002-06, averaging 17.5 points and 9.1 rebounds per game in his senior season. 20 years removed from his playing days in East Lansing, he still drops by games and on Monday got a bit too into the action to earn an ejection from officials and some admonishment from his former coach. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        We're already halfway through the 2025-26 NHL season, and that means it's time to hand out some (midseason) awards. Fortunately for 31 other teams, the team doesn't end today because the Colorado Avalanche would be taking home all the hardware if it did.Right now, Nathan MacKinnon and Connor McDavid are atop the Hart Trophy race. MacKinnon has been rolling along all season, but McDavid has closed the gap lately as he tries to will the Edmonton Oilers into the playoffs. If there's another name to watch for the NHL's most prestigious individual award, it would be Macklin Celebrini of the San Jose Sharks. He has turned that franchise around in a hurry.As always, Cale Makar is one of the frontrunners for the Norris Trophy, and Avalanche coach Jared Bednar looks like he could buck the usual trend of Jack Adams Award winners. The only areas in which Colorado might not clean up are the Vezina Trophy and the Calder Trophy.The Vezina Trophy race will probably go down to the wire with a handful of candidates boasting legitimate cases for the award. You can probably go ahead and start etching Matthew Schaefer's name on the Calder Trophy, though.\nWith half of the NHL season in the rearview mirror, here are your major award winners so far.Hart Trophy | Nathan MacKinnon | Avalanche\nYes, Connor McDavid has been on an insane heater of late. He's made the Hart Trophy race much tighter than it was just a few weeks ago, but MacKinnon has played at that level all season. MacKinnon is on pace for 70 goals, which would be a new career high by a country mile. He's also tracking toward 148 points, which would be a career high.The numbers on the stat sheet are reason enough for MacKinnon to be a leading candidate for the Hart Trophy, but it's what's under the hood that truly separates him. With MacKinnon on the ice at five-on-five, The Avalanche have outscored opponents 58-16, per Natural Stat Trick. That plus-42 goal differential leads all players by a wide margin. Colorado has been practically unstoppable with MacKinnon in the game.\nRunner-up: Connor McDavid, OilersNorris Trophy | Cale Makar | Avalanche\nIt wasn't enough for the Avalanche to have the league MVP on their roster. They also had to have the NHL's best defenseman. Makar is gunning for his second consecutive Norris Trophy, and it looks like he will get it. I don't think anyone would mistake Makar for a shutdown defenseman, but sometimes the best way to defend is by keeping the puck at the other end of the rink. In that regard, Makar has little competition.With 47 points in 41 games, Makar is on his way to another career year (94 points). That alone shouldn't be the measure of a Norris Trophy candidate, but it certainly helps. The bottom line is that Makar is a huge net positive whenever he's on the ice. Makar's plus-25 goal differential at five-on-five isn't quite as eye-popping as MacKinnon's, but it's still absurdly good, especially for a No. 1 defenseman facing some tough competition.Runner-up: Moritz Seider, Red WingsVezina Trophy | Jesper Wallstedt | Wild\nThe Vezina Trophy race is wide open, and there are a handful of goalies who should be in consideration at this point. I gave Wallstedt the nod because he's been able to post some dominant numbers -- albeit over a smaller sample size than other candidates for the award. In just 14 appearances, Wallstedt has saved 15.5 goals above average (1st in the NHL), according to Natural Stat Trick. He's also posted a .926 save percentage and a .854 high-danger save percentage. Did I mention that nearly 25% of his starts have resulted in shutouts?\nWhile Wallstedt has been tremendous, it should be noted that there's a lot of hockey left to play. Can Wallstedt keep this up throughout the second half of the season? He's got an impressive pedigree, but Wallstedt has just 22 career games under his belt. If he falters, Spencer Knight, Scott Wedgewood and Logan Thompson will be right on his heels.Runner-up: Spencer Knight, BlackhawksCalder Trophy | Matthew Schaefer | Islanders\nThe New York Islanders expected big things out of Schaefer when they called his name with the No. 1 pick last summer, but I'm not sure anyone expected him to flourish this quickly. The 18-year-old has adjusted to the NHL seamlessly, and that's resulted in 12 goals and 16 assists from the blue line in just 42 games.On top of that, Schaefer has served as a steadying presence at even strength, which is impressive for a player of his age. The rookie defenseman is right around break even in terms of his expected goals share at five-on-five (49.0%), and he boasts a plus-12 goal differential in those situations. If Jesper Wallstedt keeps stonewalling teams on a nightly basis, he could make a push for this award, but Schaefer is the clear frontrunner now.\nRunner-up: Jesper Wallstedt, WildJack Adams Award | Jared Bednar | AvalancheThe way this award usually works is that it goes to the coach who does the most with the least -- often leading a pedestrian roster to the postseason. That needs to change this season because Bednar has Colorado playing like one of the best teams in NHL history, and that's not hyperbole. With a 31-3-7 record through 41 games, the Avalanche are on track to break the league record with 138 standings points.Not only are the wins piling up, but the underlying numbers paint a picture of a true juggernaut. Colorado leads the league with a five-on-five expected goals share of 57.3%, per Natural Stat Trick. The Avs lead the league in goals scored (164) and goals against (89). The only thing that hasn't been clicking is the power play, but I imagine it's only a matter of time before the Avalanche iron out those wrinkles to bludgeon opponents even worse than they already are.Runner-up: Jon Cooper, Lightning\n            ",

    "body": "\n        It was a historical year for the NFC West. The Seahawks (14-3), Rams (12-5) and 49ers (12-5) all won at least 12 games, marking the first time in NFL history that a single division has produced three teams that won at least 12 games. The 2025 NFC West could go down as one of the best divisions in NFL history if one of those three teams can figure out a way to win the Super Bowl, but there's definitely no guarantee that's going to happen. As a matter of fact, over the course of NFL history, playing in a tough division has ended up working against teams when it comes to winning the Super Bowl.  This year's NFC West is the fifth division since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970 to produce three different teams that won at least 11 games and NONE of the previous four divisions produced a Super Bowl winner. Let's check out what happened with the four other divisions. 1984 AFC WestLet's rewind back to 1984 when the Seahawks were still in the AFC. Here were the three playoff teams from the AFC West that year: \nBroncos (13-3)Seahawks (12-4)Raiders (11-5)Outcome: The Seahawks and Raiders got stuck playing each other in the wild card round, which knocked out one of the AFC West teams right away. The Seahawks advanced to the divisional round with a 13-7 win over the Raiders, but then ended up getting destroyed by the Dolphins in the divisional round, 31-10. As for the Broncos, they were the No. 2 seed in the AFC playoffs and they got a first-round bye, but they ended up losing 24-17 at home to the Steelers in the divisional round. \n        \n            \n                2026 NFL playoff bracket projection: Rams overcome surprising Jaguars for Super Bowl title\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n1985 AFC EastAfter the AFC West produced three teams with at least 11 wins in 1984, the AFC East pulled off the same feat one year later. Here are the playoff teams from the 1985 AFC East. Dolphins (12-4)Jets (11-5)Patriots (11-5)Outcome: Just like the AFC West in 1984, the AFC East had two teams face each other in the wild card round with the Patriots beating the Jets, 26-14. The Patriots went on to beat the Raiders 27-20 in the divisional round to advance to the AFC title game. The Dolphins also advanced to the AFC title game with a 24-21 win over the Browns in the divisional round. In the AFC Championship, the 5.5-point underdog Patriots pulled off a huge upset with a 31-14 win over Miami. In the Super Bowl, the Patriots ran into a buzz saw in the form of the 1985 Bears. New England ended up losing to Chicago, 46-10, in one of the biggest blowouts in Super Bowl history. \n2020 AFC North After 1985, we went 35 years before another division came along that produced three teams with at least 11 wins. Here are the playoff teams from the 2020 AFC North. Steelers (12-4)Ravens (11-5)Browns (11-5)Outcome: Like the two divisions above, the AFC North had two teams face each other in the wild card round with the Browns picking up their first playoff win in 26 years with a 48-37 victory over the Steelers. The Ravens also had to play in the wild card round and they ended up beating the Titans, 20-13. The divisional round ended up being a nightmare for the AFC North with the Browns and Ravens both losing. Cleveland lost 22-17 to Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs while the Ravens got taken out in a 17-3 loss to the Bills. 2024 NFC North The NFC North made history last year by producing the highest winning percentage (.662) by any division since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970, a record the NFC West did NOT break. Here are the playoff teams from the 2024 NFC North. \nLions (15-2)Vikings (14-3)Packers (11-6)Outcome: The NFC North was basically viewed as one of the best divisions in NFL history, so when the playoffs started, it seemed like a guarantee that at least one team would end up making a Super Bowl run, but that didn't happen. Instead, the division ended crashing out by going 0-3 in the playoffs, and unlike our three prior divisions, the NFC North didn't have two teams face each other in the wild card round. The Vikings got smoked 27-9 by the Rams in the first round. In that same round, the Packers lost to the Eagles, 22-10. The Lions got a first-round bye, but it didn't help them: They ended up losing to the Commanders, 45-31, in one of the biggest upsets of the year. Like the AFC North in 2020, the NFC North didn't even end up sending a team to the conference championship game. So what does this all mean for the NFC West? When you're in a strong division, you spend 17 weeks beating up on each other and that takes a toll on you. The three NFC West teams went a combined 26-7 in nondivision games, but that didn't help the NFC North in 2024. Last year, the Vikings, Lions and Packers went 29-4 in nondivision games, but still went 0-3 in the postseason. The three teams in the NFC West are all great, but they're not invincible, they all have a weakness that could take them down in the postseason. \nFor the Seahawks, that's Sam Darnold. Yes, Darnold has been great this year, but he's also turned the ball over 20 times. Not only did he throw 14 interceptions, which was the third-most in the NFL, but he also lost six fumbles. It's almost unheard of for a QB to turn the ball over 20 times and still win a Super Bowl. Over the past 30 years, it's only happened three times and two of those were by Eli Manning (He turned the ball over 27 times in the regular season prior to the Giants' improbable playoff run in 2007. In 2011, he turned the ball over 20 times prior to another wild Super Bowl run). For the 49ers, their weakness is their pass rush. The 49ers only recorded 20 sacks in 2025, which was the lowest total in the NFL by far (Every other team in the NFL had at least 26 sacks). In the Super Bowl era, the 49ers are just the fifth team with 20 sacks or less to make the playoffs and the previous four teams went 0-4 in the postseason (1970 Dolphins, 1979, Broncos, 2014 Bengals, 2020 Titans). The 2006 Colts won the Super Bowl despite racking up just 25 sacks and right now, that's the lowest total ever for a Super Bowl winner. On the Rams' end, they're going to need to get better at stopping the run. The defense was solid against the run for most of the season, but in the final three games of the year, the Rams gave up an average of 156.3 rushing yards per game. The problem there is that the Rams went 1-3 this year in the four games this year where they surrendered at least 140 rushing yards. If the other team can run the ball, that keeps Matthew Stafford and the high-powered offense off the field, which makes it more difficult for the Rams to win. \nSo yes, the NFC West made history this year, but the division is going to have defy history to win a Super Bowl. The best divisions in NFL history always seem to come up empty in the playoffs, but the Seahawks, Rams and 49ers will be looking to end that trend. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The holiday season is in the rearview mirror and pitchers and catchers are just over a month away from reporting for duty. That means it's time for teams to get serious about completing their offseasons and their rosters alike. Below, CBS Sports has compiled all of Tuesday's most notable murmurs and moves in one place for your viewing convenience. Blue Jays still considered favorites for TuckerMore than a month has passed since Kyle Tucker, the top free agent on the market, visited the Blue Jays' player development complex in Dunedin, Fla. And while no deal has since been struck between the parties, Toronto continues to be viewed as the favorites to land Tucker's services, two industry sources told MLB.com's Mark Feinsand. \nThe Blue Jays, the reigning American League champions, have had one of the busiest winters in the sport. In addition to signing right-hander Dylan Cease, they've also inked pitchers Cody Ponce and Tyler Rogers and infielder Kazuma Okamoto, who is transferring from Japan's NPB to MLB.Tucker, 29 in just over a week, would slot into Toronto's outfield. Over the past three seasons, he's hit .278/.380/.511 (150 OPS+) while averaging 25 home runs, 22 stolen bases, and 4.9 Wins Above Replacement. \nTucker has also been connected to the Dodgers, Yankees, Mets, Diamondbacks, and Giants throughout the offseason.Dodgers 'hovering' on top starsThe Dodgers, MLB's first repeat World Series champions in more than two decades, are believed to be involved in the bidding for both Tucker and free-agent infielder Bo Bichette. Per ESPN, agents believe the Dodgers are hoping to land one of the two \"on a shorter-term deal with a high average annual value closer to their price range.\"The comparison to keep in mind is to first baseman Freddie Freeman, who joined the Dodgers in March 2022 after a prolonged free agency. Freeman signed for six years and $162 million, or $27 million annually. \nBichette, 27, has hit .291/.333/.445 (114 OPS+) over the last three seasons while averaging 14 home runs, five stolen bases, and 2.7 Wins Above Replacement. He's signaled a willingness to move off shortstop if so desired, opening up his fits to include teams who already have quality shortstops in place. \n            ",

That's crazy. Similarly nutty, Nebraska's men's basketball program is undefeated and ranked in the top 10 for the first time since 1966.As my colleague Tom Fornelli posted on X, it's like a 90s funhouse mirror these days -- not to mention evidence that, in this era of college athletics, the right coach with the right resources can win big anywhere at the power-conference level.What you've been doesn't really matter anymore. Hire the right coach, give the right coach the right resources and good things should follow. That's the lesson of Curt Cignetti at Indiana, a traditional basketball power that's never done much in football until now. It's also the story of Fred Hoiberg at Nebraska, a traditional football power that's never won a game in the NCAA Tournament but is still one of six undefeated teams left in the sport this season thanks to Monday night's 72-69 victory at Ohio State that improved the Cornhuskers to 15-0.Did it take Hoiberg longer than expected to get it going at Nebraska?Yeah, I guess.

And with every Quad-1 win -- Nebraska is up to four, by the way -- it's becoming increasingly clear that the Cornhuskers should have the type of seed in the NCAA Tournament that makes them favorites in the first round, making it likely they'll be positioned to win a game in that event for what would be, again, the first time in school history.\nNebraska is No. 9 in Tuesday morning's updated CBS Sports Top 25 And 1 daily college basketball rankings, where Michigan remains No. 1 for the 28th consecutive day. Next up for the Cornhuskers' is Saturday's game at Indiana. A victory there will extend the program's winning streak to 20 games because, remember, Nebraska closed last season by winning four straight in the inaugural College Basketball Crown Tournament.

    "body": "\n        Recent logic in football says running backs aren't worth overpaying. But an older adage still applies: value is whatever someone will pay. Enter Jadan Baugh, the star Florida running back who -- of Tuesday morning -- has not entered the transfer portal yet continues to see his price tag for the 2026 season driven up by warring interests. Multiple sources indicate $1 million is now the floor for Baugh's services, either in Gainesville or elsewhere, and that all means the running back market has simply exploded. In 2024, CBS Sports did analysis of the market at each position with the range for running backs between $200,000-$300,000. At the time, Ohio State's Quinshon Judkins was on the high end making, according to a source, around $650,000. Now the high end is into the seven figures at the position. \"Who are the agents telling kids that a reasonable ask? Surely it can't be anyone with a frontal lobe?\" One industry source responded to the seven-figure ceiling number. \nOne Big Ten general manager told CBS Sports: \"The running back numbers have been absolutely stupid. They don't make any sense.\"While the average, according to industry sources, is $400,000 to $700,000 at the position this year, that signals that the price has risen in the revenue sharing era overall. Kewan Lacy decided Tuesday to stay with Ole Miss rather than follow Lane Kiffin to LSU and his price point will be significantly higher than Baugh's, an indicator of the even more desperate battle the Rebels and Kiffin are up to. It may strike fans as odd as the emphasis on running backs has been lessened at the professional level, but college football operates a little differently with a running back having more of an outsized impact on an offense's success, and there's no worry about the spectre of a player turning 30 and falling off a cliff production wise. If Baugh were to enter the portal, it is expected he would be one of, if not the highest ranked player at the position in the 247Sports transfer portal rankings and likely a top 10 player overall, according to transfer portal analyst Cooper Petagna. \nThe stakes are high around Baugh, who rushed for 1,170 yards last season. Some Florida fans expected an announcement he'd be remaining at the school over the weekend, but that came and went. There is a level of legitimacy within the fanbase that retaining Baugh would give new head coach Jon Sumrall, who is under scrutiny because he is the second Group of Five coach at Florida, right or wrong. And there is an implicit level of seriousness involved with the concept of stepping up to pay a star player. Baugh is a symbol of that for Florida in 2026, and Sumrall and his staff know that well. Baugh was the SEC's third-leading rusher last year, and the lasting memory Florida fans have of him is running for a rivalry game record 266 yards against Florida State at home to end the season. Florida fans also remember in 2023, when promising running back Trevor Etienne left in the portal to go to their other hated rival, Georgia. If Baugh leaves, a source at Florida indicated it will not be because the Gators are outbid. The Dawgs are expected to be in the mix if he were to leave Florida, but are not in pole position. That would be Texas. \nFor Texas (which he is most closely rumored to be heading if he leaves) and specifically new running backs coach Jabbar Juluke, securing Baugh would be a coup as it embarks on what is likely the final season of Arch Manning at Texas and thus has serious aspirations at the school's first national championship in 20 years. Four Texas running backs are in the portal, including three of its top-four backs in terms of carries. It was an industry assumption when Juluke came over from Florida that Baugh would be following as the post-Billy Napier exits piled up. Texas wants multiple running backs in the portal and has contingency plans if they miss out on Baugh, but none will be as good (or, albeit, as expensive). As of Monday afternoon, Florida was putting up a strong fight to keep Baugh and others who Texas specifically wanted, which would be the type of win that would buoy Sumrall through the offseason. \nWhat the market around Baugh indicates is that the market for player compensation continues to mature rapidly. The sticker shock exists, but it's the price of doing business in today's college football. Baugh finds himself caught in a bidding war between two desperate parties. He stands to become the richest \n            ",

    "body": "\n        One of the NWSL's founding franchises will finally have its own training facility. After 13 years in the league, Chicago Stars FC are ringing in the new year with their first-ever club performance center. The team announced the new project on Tuesday, which is set to break ground in Spring 2026 and is expected to be completed by the end of 2027.The training ground will be on a 10-acre area in Bannockburn, Ill., which already features a 45,000 square foot adaptive reuse building that the club plans to evolve in partnership with Populous and Marquee Development. The building will include intentional recovery modalities, a weight room with easy convertible indoor to outdoor access, and \"spaces designed to enable mindfulness,\" per a club release. A Stars FC ownership group, led by Laura Ricketts, took over shortly ahead of the 2024 season with big ambitions to stabilize the club while building out its vision and maintaining a competitive club. The on-field success has been mixed in two years, with a clinging eighth-seed playoff appearance in 2024, followed by a last-place finish in 2025. Balancing roster and front office decisions with club culture building could feel like infrastructure takes a back seat, but that's not the case for the Stars heading into 2026.\n\"Long story short, it wasn't on the back burner at all. It's always been on the front burner of things we knew we would have to do to bring this club into the modern era,\" Stars FC club president Karen Leetzow told CBS Sports.\"But a lot of challenges, obviously, that we inherited with a club that needed to be addressed, perhaps more immediately, and also, real estate just takes a long time. This is one of many sites we looked at. We went and did a comprehensive review of sites all over the area. We talked to lots of different municipalities. Ultimately, ended up here for lots of technical reasons.\"A new training ground and home fieldThe new project is just another piece of the franchise rebuilding under new ownership. An earlier piece was setting an attendance record in the league with a game at Wrigley Field, and leveling the playing field for public funding equity across men's and women's pro sports in Illinois. \nAnother brick in the rebuild was making a move to a new neighborhood altogether. In September, the club announced its move to Northwestern Medicine Field at Martin Stadium in Evanston for the 2026 NWSL season. They traded in bleak monolithic SeatGeek Stadium for a more intimate, fest-like atmosphere, with a 12-000 capacity home upon the scenic shores of Lake Michigan and Chicago's iconic skyline. The new, temporary home venue comes with a flexible lease, a year-to-year solution.\"Because this club is coming from behind in a lot of ways, my goal was to find a location that suited our needs, that allowed for us to do state-of-the-art, but also could be done quickly, so that we could deliver for the players as fast as we possibly could,\" Leetzow said. \"We decided on this one because it checks all the boxes, and we could pull it forward as quickly as '27.'\"Player-driven facilitiesMany of the facility's features are based on player feedback. Leetzow and the club worked with the architecture firm to meet with players before any meetings with sporting or technical staff to ensure player-focused design on the future site.\nThe overall design will be by Populous, an architecture firm with NWSL experience, including work with Portland Thorns FC on their shared training facility alongside incoming WNBA side Portland Fire, and the NWSL's newest expansion franchise, Denver Summit FC.\"Coming from U.S. Soccer, and having been on the other side of sort of looking at what the NWSL is doing, it's really important to me, culturally, to always have everything we do be player-centric,\" Leetzow explained. \"You know, we're starting this project. We want you to be at the center, but we need to know what you think. We need to know what's important to you. You guys have played and or trained around the country, around the world. What do you like? What do you not like? What is it that you know your vision for your workspace would be? And so they took three hours worth of feedback on the kinds of things the players were looking for, and that's what we're looking to deliver against.\"\nSelecting a site with some preexisting infrastructure ensures construction and renovation can take place on an accelerated timeline. A close proximity to Northwestern in Evanston, and to the city proper, were also considerations in choosing the 10-acre space in Bannockburn. \"We look forward to welcoming the Chicago Stars to Bannockburn,\" said Village Manager Stephanie Hannon. \"This partnership supports the continued growth of women's professional sports while bringing a world-class athletic facility to our community. The Stars' commitment to excellence and their positive impact as role models for young women across the Chicagoland area make them a strong fit for our Village.\"Proximity to Northwestern, Evanston, and ChicagoWith the Stars' new stadium partnership with Northwestern, a year-to-year lease option brings flexibility within a stabilizing move. The new performance center will be accessible to Stars FC players and desired Chicagoland destinations, whether the club stays at Northwestern for one or more years.\n\"It's really important to have optionality. This is Chicago. Things happen all the time. We love the idea of being in Evanston as long as we can,\" says Leetzow.\"If you look at its proximity, for example, to the Bears training facility in Lake Forest, and they play all the way in Soldier Field, we have the advantage of being right on that highway, closer in and closer to all the things we might want to look at, from a playing facility, playing stadium facility standpoint. That said, Evanston has been really welcoming to us. It would be great if we could stay, but that is something we're looking at. Let's get the training facility done, and then pivot to our next infrastructure issue, which is the stadium situation.\"A club-specific training ground is a decade-plus project in waiting. The franchise formerly known as Red Stars began its NWSL history playing games at Benedictine University, an institution with a Division III athletics program, and shared the field with football and lacrosse programs. \nThey later moved to Bridgeview and played at SeetGeek Stadium, and despite the soccer-specific stadium, the club was never truly the primary tenant of the stadium or its surrounding training areas. Even as the Chicago Fire moved out of Bridgeview, the morning training schedules were often reserved for the MLS side, with the Stars often booked for later sessions or on different days altogether. A performance center of their own will finally change that. Sitting at the end of a cul-de-sac with gated entry, it also offers player safety and security.\"It will allow for player exclusivity, meaning it's theirs to use and theirs alone. And that is something we think we're bringing that not a lot of other clubs have, where they're sharing with a second or third team, or they're sharing with the community. That is not our intent at this point. This is a private elite space for these amazing players. It is exclusive use for the players,\" Leetzow said.\nFor now, Stars FC players will have to wait till at least the end of 2027 for renovations to be completed and to begin using the facility, but a locked door once thought impossible to open has been knocked down. New home games at Northwestern for the 2026 NWSL season and a future training site are not just a change of address for the club but a symbolic end to years filled with instability, and a strategic plan for the franchise's future.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Ole Miss standout running back Kewan Lacy agreed to a deal ahead of the 2026 season, CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz confirmed Monday night. Lacy is the nation's third-leading rusher at 1,464 yards with an SEC-leading 23 total touchdowns. He was the first Doak Walker finalist in program history, and earned All-America status.Lane Kiffin and LSU planned to pursue Lacy had he entered the transfer portal with a lucrative offer, but the Rebels locked him up, along with notables quarterback Trinidad Chambliss pending his NCAA eligibility waiver, kicker Lucas Carneiro and pass rusher Princewill Umanmielen.Kiffin brought Ole Miss running backs coach Kevin Smith with him to Baton Rouge with the expectation Lacy would be a target. LSU returns Harlem Berry in the backfield and added former Utah freshman Raycine Guillory.Player retention efforts for the Rebels strengthened with last week's win over Georgia in the Sugar Bowl, giving first-year coach Pete Golding and staff more time to assess the roster ahead of the College Football Playoff semifinals.\nOle Miss now return its record-setting 1-2 punch of Chambliss and Lacy under Golding as long as its play-making quarterback is granted a sixth year. Lacy rushed for 98 yards and two touchdowns against the Bulldogs last time out and is a focal point of the Rebels' game plan in Thursday night's Fiesta Bowl showdown against Miami. Lacy registered six 100-yard games this season after transferring from Missouri, including a 224-yard, four-touchdown explosion during a win over Florida in November.Lacy's outing against Georgia came after he injured his shoulder during the Rebels' first-round playoff win against Tulane. He finished with 15 carries for 87 yards and a touchdown in that one, the score coming one minute into the contest on a 20-yard burst. \nThe goal now for Lacy and the Rebels is to combat a Miami defense that has looked the part in two playoff games after limiting Texas A&M and Ohio State to just 17 total points.Rueben Bain Jr. and Akheem Mesidor combined for 19 sacks this season and have largely saved their top performances for the postseason.\"Those two are game-wreckers,\" Miami quarterback Carson Beck said of the Hurricanes' power up front. \"Even just having one of those guys would be a huge impact to any defense. But being able to have both of them has completely changed the course of this season and the way that our defense plays, right? ... Obviously, they've done a phenomenal job, along with the rest of the defense, this year of executing and playing a physical brand of ball, which is a lot of fun to watch.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        FRISCO, Texas -- Something had to change for the Dallas Cowboys' defense after a disastrous season. That decision came on Tuesday when the team fired defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus after just one season in the position, sources told CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones. The Cowboys will now have a fourth different defensive coordinator in as many seasons.Dallas ranked as the NFL's worst scoring defense, allowing 30.1 points per game. That's the second-most points per game allowed in the 66-season history of the Cowboys with only Dallas' inaugural 1960 team that went 0-11-1 being worse.The Cowboys capped off a 7-9-1 season on Sunday with a 34-17 loss in New York against the Giants.Eberflus took ownership and accountability for Dallas' lack of defensive execution on New Year's Day, so naturally he was held accountable for his unit's results. \n\"Ownership and accountability is right with me,\" Eberflus said. \"I'm the defensive coordinator, so it's always that. … I take full accountability. We wanted to see more progress during the course of the year. It was just more up and down. It just wasn't linear.\"  It is worth noting Jones did trade away All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons, the team's best defensive player, to the Green Bay Packers after failed extension talks a week before the 2025 season began. That put Eberflus in a tough spot before the season even began.\"Obviously you have an All-Pro pass rusher that wins really quick [Parsons], that's certainly going to help any defense if it's Micah or if it's Myles [Garrett] or whoever that might be. But that impact player is always going to help to a certain degree in pass downs and other downs,\" Eberflus said. Again, you can't look back right? It is what it is and then you just focus where you are.\"  \nDallas' defense was sidetracked by injuries up and down their cornerback position with DaRon Bland (foot), ex-Cowboy Trevon Diggs (knee/concussion), Shavon Revel (knee) and Caelen Carson (knee, hamstring). Diggs and Eberflus also clashed about zone vs. man coverage usage all year long before Dallas released him after Week 17. \"I think the start of the year, guys were in and out, in terms of we weren't at full force,\" Eberflus said. \"And then when we got some guys back, I thought we had a good stretch there. I thought the stretch was pretty good. We started to improve. I know we improved in the run defense and the third-down defense. And then from there we just didn't execute the way we wanted to at certain moments. Certainly, some good execution in there at times, but it's got to be better.\"  The additions of three-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kenny Clark in the Parsons trade, and All-Pro defensive tackle Quinnen Williams in a trade deadline deal with the New York Jets helped the Cowboys improve their run defense. Dallas ranked 29th in run defense in 2024 (137.1 rushing yards per game allowed) and 23rd in 2025 (125.5 rushing yards per game allowed). However, the Cowboys were the NFL's worst passing defense, allowing 251.5 passing yards per game because of a lack of sack production without Parsons (35 in 2025, tied for the 11th-fewest in the league) and disarray in coverage in the secondary. \nJones took some accountability for Dallas' defensive woes, saying he understands the team has to acquire better players on all three levels of its defense in order to improve in 2026 no matter who is calling the plays.  \"What that defense represents is the personnel department, that represents above that, my department. It represents everybody involved in contracts. We all take it, and that's no kidding,\" Jones said on Jan. 2 on 105.3 The Fan in Dallas. … \"I'll assure you, we won't walk in there and say, 'You know what, Eberflus and this guy over here and this guy over here, let's change that out and it'll all be [alright]. Let's go get a Coke and let them think about it.' That's not how it works.\"  However, if given the chance to go back in time at the start of 2025, Eberflus felt he didn't think he would \"do anything differently.\" That's an intriguing stance to take after coordinating a defense that ranked bottom-three in the NFL in numerous key metrics this season.\n\"I don't really think about it that way,\" Eberflus said. \"I think about being in the moment and just keep adjusting and learning and growing and getting better. I don't think I'd do anything differently. I think I would just work to adjust when you get different players in and those things. I think that's what you do as a coach.\"    Cowboys defense under Matt Eberflus in 2025, NFL ranksNFL rankPPG allowed30.1* LastTotal YPG allowed377.030thYards per play allowed6.131stPassing yards per game allowed251.5LastThird down conversion rate allowed 47.3%LastRed zone TD rate allowed 66.7%29thCompletion percentage allowed68.5%30thPass yards per attempt allowed8.131stPasser Rating109.631st* Second-most PPG allowed in a season in the Cowboys' 66-season historyWith the way the Cowboys defense played in 2025, quarterback Dak Prescott leaves the 2025 season feeling frustrated despite being the NFL's third-leading passer with 4,552 yards through the air. That's in part to feeling like his level of play didn't impact Dallas' 7-9-1 record with the defensive issues negating the offense's production. \"Being in a year where I can't say [for] probably one of the first times that my play directly... correlated to the record or making the playoffs, it's been tough,\" Prescott said on Jan. 1.  ... \"It just goes back to me just as a leader trying to figure out ways to influence other guys in the locker room, not just on offense but on defense. Influence everything from the way that they approach the game, the way that they treat life at home and just letting them know how important all that is. It goes hand in hand when you're trying to be the best player on the field.\"All-Pro wide receiver CeeDee Lamb also lamented the offense's efforts not translating to wins. Prescott ranked third in the NFL in passing yards (4,552), wide receiver George Pickens ranked third in the league in receiving yards (1,429), running back Javonte Williams ranked ninth in the league in rushing yards (1,201) and Lamb ranked 11th in the league in receiving yards (1,077) despite missing three games with an ankle injury. That's why the four-time Pro Bowl receiver is dreaming up how much more productive the offense may need to be in order to make up for the defensive shortcomings going forward in 2026. \"Part of it is upsetting, but then again, you realize it's a business. You can't do one without the other right? So as for us, we got to get better. You got to get better,\" Lamb said on Jan. 1. \"Maybe next year, we'll have two 1,500-yard receivers, a 5,000-yard passer and a 1,000-yard rusher. So just the bar for ourselves. ... I feel like that's how we got to look at it. You have to look at it as the glass is half full and not half empty.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        One of the first things Curt Cignetti said after Indiana's 38-3 blowout of Alabama in the Rose Bowl was how much harder it is to beat a good team twice. He knew why he was saying it. Indiana's next opponent would be the same Oregon team it beat 30-20 at Autzen Stadium earlier this season.Cignetti has repeated the line every chance he's gotten since, and that's no accident. He learned far more than Xs and Os under Nick Saban. He understands messaging. He knows what his players need to hear and how often they need to hear it. Indiana players will be reminded again and again that \"they say you can't beat a great team twice,\" with a heavy subtext of nobody believes in us as they prepare for the rematch.While Cignetti is clearly using it as motivation, there's also some truth behind it. It's not that you can't beat a great team twice; it's that the team that loses the first meeting usually comes away with a much clearer picture of what needs to change. And in this case, what Oregon needs to do better is obvious.Protect Dante Moore.\n        \n            \n                Tom Fornelli's College Football Playoff betting guide: CFP semifinal picks for Miami-Ole Miss, Indiana-Oregon\n                \n                    Tom Fornelli                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMoore has been sacked 15 times this season. Overall, he's been one of the better quarterbacks in the country at avoiding pressure, facing it on just 23.5% of his dropbacks -- seventh-best among qualified quarterbacks. Perhaps not coincidentally, Miami's Carson Beck and Ole Miss' Trinidad Chambliss rank first and second. However, when Moore is pressured, he's been more vulnerable. His pressure-to-sack rate of 6.4 ranks 48th nationally, and his sack rate of 3.9% is 21st. In other words, when Oregon fails to keep heat off him, Moore is susceptible to it.\nThat problem was glaring against Indiana.Moore was pressured on 47.6% of his dropbacks and sacked six times. Forty percent of all the sacks he's taken this season came in that one game. It's an eye-popping number, but it shouldn't come as a shock.Newsflash to anyone who hasn't been paying attention: Indiana's pass rush is very good. The Hoosiers' team pressure rate of 41.2% ranks fourth nationally, and their sack rate of 9.2% ranks eighth -- both ahead of Miami. How they get there depends on who you ask.One coach whose team faced Indiana told CBS Sports defensive coordinator Bryant Haines and his players \"are great at disguising their looks pre-snap and giving you an entirely new picture after. They confused the shit out of our quarterback.\" A coach from another opponent disagreed, saying it wasn't about confusion at all. \"They whipped our butts up front every snap,\" he said.\nBased on the film and the numbers, my suspicion is that Oregon -- and Moore -- fell into the confusion bucket.According to PFF, Oregon allowed pressure in an average of 2.49 seconds in the first meeting. That's not particularly alarming. In fact, Moore faced faster pressure in five other games this season, including against Penn State, Iowa and even James Madison. The key difference is what happened after the snap. Moore took an average of 2.89 seconds to get rid of the ball. That was the longest average time-to-throw he had in any game this season.Moore was dropping back and didn't know what he was looking at.Whatever the cause, Oregon has to solve that puzzle. Every team Indiana faced this season only saw them once. We don't yet know how \"confusing\" that defense will be the second time around. How well the Ducks adjust their game plan based on what they learned in the first meeting will go a long way toward determining whether Cignetti's favorite line remains a talking point - or becomes a footnote.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The season has come to an end for more than half of the league's top teams, which kicks off the season of hope. A year ago, the Patriots were one of the league's worst teams and the Saints did not know who was going to be the quarterback of the future. A lot can change in a year, but it is all about how a team executes its plan. Each team has a reason to be optimistic for the future and hope that next year is different. Here is that reason for each team who fell short of the playoffs: \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Atlanta FalconsAtlanta has a quarterback on a rookie deal. There is an opportunity to build around Michael Penix Jr. They have to get the head coaching hire right and that could bring a rejuvenated energy to the building. They have two of the best skill players at their respective positions: wide receiver Drake London and running back Bijan Robinson. The pass rush has finally been improved with rookies Jalon Walker and James Pearce Jr. both exhibiting promise. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Arizona CardinalsArizona has drafted and developed well in the secondary, but there are also reasons to be excited about the front seven. Defensive tackle Walter Nolen was a disruptive player when available this season. If he, as well as Darius Robinson, can continue developing, perhaps that will lead to turnover opportunities for the likes of Will Johnson Jr., Garrett Williams, Max Melton and others on the back end.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Cincinnati BengalsIf Joe Burrow is healthy for the full season, then Cincinnati will be competitive. They possess two of the best wide receivers in the game and have one of the most explosive offenses in the league. The leading voices in that operation are returning, which can be good based on how one wants to look at it. If they can find a few players on defense capable of impacting the boxscore, then the bounce back could be higher than anticipated. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Cleveland BrownsCleveland has a lot of talent on defense: edge rusher Myles Garrett, linebacker Carson Schwesinger, safety Grant Delpit, defensive tackle Mason Graham, etc. If they get some pieces in place on offense, including the position that has eluded them for more than two decades, then there is an opportunity to rise quickly.Additionally, the team has ample draft capital, including two first-round picks in 2026, to make those improvements or move up for a quarterback. There is little room for error and making the wrong move could set them back long-term when considering the age of key players like Denzel Ward, Maliek Collins and Garrett. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Dallas CowboysThe majority of the offensive infrastructure is in place. Quarterback Dak Prescott's ceiling may fluctuate but he is a competent performer at the game's most important position. They could potentially return talented pass catchers CeeDee Lamb, George Pickens and Jake Ferguson. Running back Javonte Williams was an impactful free agent signing. The offensive line should be in relatively good shape given the sheer number of early draft picks of which it is comprised. \nThe defense needs a lot of work, but defensive tackle Quinnen Williams and eye-catching moments from rookie pass rusher Donovan Ezeiruaku ensure that the depth chart is not totally barren. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Indianapolis ColtsThe hope is that Daniel Jones returns to form and can pick up where he left off this season. If he can, Indianapolis will have a starting quarterback at a discount. Offensive line development has been good and there are quality pass catchers on the roster: tight end Tyler Warren, wide receiver Josh Downs and wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr. There are pieces to an effective defense, such as cornerback Sauce Gardner, defensive tackle DeForest Buckner and edge rusher Laiatu Latu. The outlook on the overall roster is more promising than it had been last year. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Kansas City ChiefsThe reasons for optimism should be pretty straight forward. If Patrick Mahomes is on schedule to return next season, Kansas City will once again be in the mix to contend for the AFC. The offensive line has banked a year of experience working together and the hope is that rookie left tackle Josh Simmons is able to stay on the field. It would benefit the team to identify a deep ball threat for which the opposition has to account. In theory, that would allow Rashee Rice the freedom to continue operating underneath. Key pieces, such as tight end Travis Kelce and defensive tackle Chris Jones, may be nearing the end of their tenure with the franchise and it is important to identify the building blocks of the next title run. Fortunately, they are strapped with premium draft capital of which they have not seen in quite some time. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Las Vegas RaidersLas Vegas made all the wrong moves last offseason. They aggressively invested in a roster that was not built to contend. The byproduct of those decisions, however, is the ammunition to potentially find a quarterback of the future. \nIf Indiana's Fernando Mendoza is the pick, then it is exciting to think about the collection of young skill players, including running back Ashton Jeanty and tight end Brock Bowers. Sure, there are big needs to fill along the offensive line and in the defense, but teams like Washington and Houston have shown in recent years that finding the quarterback can rejuvenate a franchise overnight. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Miami DolphinsMiami had won four consecutive games after looking like one of the league's worst teams, but then finished the season having lost three of its last four. For the time being, it seems as though Mike McDaniel will be back, so continuity can be a positive. Running back Devon Achane and wide receiver Jaylen Waddle are two of the most explosive players in the country with the ball in their hands. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New Orleans SaintsTyler Shough's success to end the season has already begun to alter the threads of the franchise. They are expecting to compete, if not win, each week. It can not be overstated how advantageous it is to have a competent quarterback in place entering the offseason and the Saints have found theirs. \nNew Orleans needs to find another weapon or two, but have an early pick in the 2026 NFL Draft to facilitate those needs. The defense also remains a work in progress with veterans like Cam Jordan and Demario Davis presumably nearing the end of their respective careers. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New York GiantsNew York's roster, as a whole, may need some work, but there are foundational pieces. With a full offseason entrenched as the starter, the team will be able to properly evaluate Jaxson Dart as a viable starting quarterback. He had some success upon initially joining the starting lineup but injuries and leadership changes brought the operation back down to earth. Malik Nabers and Cam Skattebo should be fully recovered in 2026. Brian Burns, Abdul Carter, Kayvon Thibodeaux and Dexter Lawrence form one of the league's best defensive lines on paper. They also have a top-5 overall selection, which could be propositioned to the highest bidder and bring back an even larger return or, at minimum, lead to the addition of another blue-chip talent.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New York JetsThe Jets are better equipped than any other team to add impact players. Over the next two years, New York has five first-round picks as a result the Quinnen Williams and Sauce Gardner trades. The offensive line is in good shape because of the investment in the unit through the draft and wide receiver Garrett Wilson should return healthy in 2026. Execution is paramount, but the Jets could become an entertaining offense, at the very least, with improved quarterback play. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Tennessee TitansTitans fans should take solace in the fact that they will not be wandering the quarterback wilderness this offseason. While the Browns, Jets and other franchises seek the player who can bring life to the game's most important position, Tennessee has its guy. Cam Ward had some truly awe-inspiring moments this season and that is why he was the quarterback selection on the All-Rookie team.\nThe franchise made the mistake of spending to surround quarterback Will Levis with better talent a year earlier and the vision did not come to fruition. At least in 2025, Tennessee was realistic with its goals. For that reason, they can continue building from the ground up rather than wasting time unraveling past mistakes. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Washington CommandersWashington needs to be realistic with where they are in the rebuilding process this offseason. Last year, they followed Houston's model of trying to speed up the rebuild process with the acquisitions of players like Deebo Samuel and Laremy Tunsil. The Commanders have legitimate question marks on defense.With a top-10 overall selection in the 2026 NFL Draft and the presumptive return of a healthy Jayden Daniels, Washington could more closely resemble the team who went to the NFC Championship less than a year ago. \n            ",

The end of the season is always bittersweet because while we're all excited to crown a new national champion and watch the final playoff games, we know that what comes immediately after it is seven months without college football.It's also depressing because we're down -2.59 units in the College Football Playoff through two rounds and only have three games left to get back on the positive side of the ledger! But we can. Perhaps having fewer games to focus on will lead to better results?Fiesta Bowl\nNo. 6 Ole Miss vs. No. 10 Miami: I want to start here with something that's worth watching in this game, and is something that does go slightly against what my pick for the game is. We have seen the turf be an issue at the Fiesta Bowl in recent years. I don't know the exact science behind it, but my theory is that something about it being winter and there being a full season's worth of NFL games that have been played on it leads to less-than-ideal conditions. You see players slipping on this sod like they're playing on skates, and that can lead to problems for everybody, particularly defenders.Still, it's hard to handicap that accurately, so I'm attacking this game by focusing on how I feel it is most likely to play out. While Miami's upset win over Ohio State was the largest upset in playoff history according to the spread, I believe Ole Miss' win over Georgia was far more surprising. It was also more death-defying, as Trinidad Chambliss was pulling rabbits out of multiple hats while walking on a tightrope to deliver incredible plays in the second half of the Sugar Bowl. Is that performance repeatable? Probably not, but who knows? Maybe Chambliss is Johnny Manziel. Or maybe the Miami pass rush he'll be dealing with here is much better than the Georgia one he faced, and possibly better than any he's seen all year.\nThe difference is that Miami doesn't run as deep along its defensive line as some other elite units. The Canes have their four guys they count on for most downs, and I can't blame them for it. Ole Miss will look to counter this by upping their tempo on offense and wearing them down. It's a sensible strategy, and one Miami is well aware of. The Rebels won't be the first team to try it. So I expect Miami will look to control the clock on offense and put together long drives to protect its defense and keep it fresh.And I believe Miami will be successful doing so. The Ole Miss defense isn't bad, but it's the worst of the four remaining teams. Despite their wins, it's a unit that has struggled in two playoff games as well. Tulane did not score against them, but it did move the ball well, particularly on the ground. Georgia ran the ball effectively as well before Nate Frazier got dinged up.Look for Miami to lean on Mark Fletcher Jr. and the run game, and go with shorter passes to Malachi Toney and others as an extension of the run game. They'll take the explosives as they come, but they won't hunt them. It'll be far more about controlling the clock, putting together long drives, and shortening this game. The Pick: Under 51.5 (-105) at FanDuel\nPeach BowlNo. 1 Indiana vs. No. 5 Oregon: We have seen this game before, as Indiana went on the road to Autzen Stadium and beat the Ducks 30-20 earlier this season. That first game is important both for what we learned watching it and what both teams may have learned while playing it.Indiana sacked Dante Moore six times in the game. For perspective, Moore has been sacked nine times total in Oregon's other 13 games. In short, the Indiana front did to Moore and the Ducks what it has done to so many other opponents. It overwhelmed and confused the Ducks' offensive line and quarterback, leading to chaos after the snap. Well, how confusing will it be now that Oregon has seen it? Oregon's ability to learn from its mistakes in the first meeting will be one of the biggest factors in this game, as will Indiana's ability to find new ways to confound the Ducks even further.What Moore's performance in that first meeting has overshadowed a bit is that Indiana's Fernando Mendoza wasn't exactly incredible himself. He threw a pick-6 that tied the game at 20-20 late, and his final passer efficiency of 127.0 in the game was his second-worst this season (ahead of only Old Dominion in the opener, which is pretty funny in retrospect, but also understandable, seeing as how it was his first start with a new team). I know Oregon's defense was incredible last week, but that was due to the opponent as much as anything. Texas Tech's offense hasn't been good all year if you take away explosives. Indiana hits them with high frequency, but isn't reliant on them. They're just as happy churning, as their 52.9% success rate on offense (the nation's best mark) will testify. \nI'm not nearly as confident in the Oregon offense. The best defenses the Ducks have faced this season are Indiana, Iowa, Penn State and Texas Tech. In those four games, we have seen the Ducks average only 1.82 points per drive with a success rate of 41.0%, an average EPA per snap of -0.10 (yep, negative) and an explosive play rate of 7.9%. Their season-long numbers are 3.15 points per drive, 47.7% success rate, an average EPA of 0.19 and an explosive play rate of 15.0%. In other words, their performance against top defenses has nose-dived. It's very possible that the fact this is a second chance will help the Ducks crack the code and break through, but based on what I've seen all year long, I'm not sure it's the most likely outcome. After all, if you remove defensive scores from those four games, as well as overtime against Penn State, the Ducks' offense averaged only 17.25 points per game in regulation.

Brent Brookhouse here, writing my first Tuesday newsletter without a Monday Night Football game the evening before, marking a strange moment as I realize we are truly into 2026.While my hopes are high and my nerves are frayed awaiting another NFL postseason that my beloved Bills can finally get over the hump and not only make, but win, a Super Bowl, I will soothe myself with a plethora of sports action this lovely Tuesday. With international soccer from the morning to the afternoon followed by college basketball, NHL and NBA action, there should be enough to distract me from worrying too much about the team who lost Super Bowl XXV, the first game I can remember watching as a child and the game that cemented me as a Bills fan. Let's dig into all the news you need to know this Tuesday morning.  🏈 Five things to know Tuesday Prepping for the NFL playoffs ... The NFL playoffs get underway this weekend and it's a rare year where everything feels wide open. We broke down each matchup to provide a ranking of the most intriguing games this weekend. The Seahawks are now the favorites to win the Super Bowl according to sportsbooks, while the 49ers implied chances dropped significantly, possibly because San Francisco lost yet another linebacker.... and the NFL Draft. For those teams not fortunate enough to make the playoffs, attention has quickly shifted to the 2026 NFL Draft. Mike Renner's latest mock draft is now available, and there's no surprise as Renner believes the Raiders will us their top pick to take Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza, the odds-on favorite to go No. 1.It's college basketball rankings time. While Arizona and Michigan held on to the No. 1 and 2 slots in the AP Top 25, respectively, North Carolina and Kansas tumbled. Meanwhile, in the coaches poll, Florida has dropped out of the top 25, while Nebraska has continued to climb, hitting No. 11 this week.Predicting the College Football Playoff. The race for the national championship is down to just four teams. We are just days away from determining the two teams who will meet in the CFP finals. On Thursday, Miami will clash with Ole Miss, while Friday will see Oregon play Indiana. With so many upsets and surprising results in the first two rounds, the CBS Sports college football experts didn't predict the bracket correctly, so we gave them a second chance to predict how the rest of the CFP would play out.  Also, we took a look at how Ole Miss could shake the Lane Kiffin drama to become national champions.Bryce Underwood staying at Michigan. An ugly stretch of coaching drama in Michigan had many questioning whether quarterback Bryce Underwood would return to the school or enter the transfer portal. Underwood shut down all speculation with a social media post announcing his return to the Wolverines on Monday. 🎠 Do not miss this: NFL coaching carousel chaos commences \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Four NFL head coaches were fired within 24 hours of the season ending, with the Browns firing Kevin Stefanski after six seasons, the Falcons saying farewell to Raheem Morris, the Raiders letting Pete Carroll go, and the Cardinals parting ways with Jonathan Gannon. The end of the NFL regular season can bring swift ends to coaching terms, and 2026 has proven no different, with six teams now seeking a new coach. \nJared Dubin ranked the six vacancies from most to least desirable, coming up with the following rankings: FalconsGiantsTitansRaidersBrownsCardinalsWe have a lot more for you to catch up on the various vacancies in the league: Browns fire Kevin Stefanski: Here are five potential coaches who could replace himCould Curt Cignetti draw NFL attention? Las Vegas, with Fernando Mendoza, is a hypothetical fitFalcons overhaul power structure: Arthur Blank seeking new 'president of football' 🔄 Gearing up for the NBA trade deadline \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            The NBA trade deadline is now less than one month away. The Feb. 5 deadline marks the last moment for teams to make significant impactful changes to their rosters as they push for the playoffs. There is still another milestone to come, however, with the last batch of 2025 free agents hitting the market in just nine days. With such an impactful time fast approaching, Sam Quinn took a look at the 10 biggest names who could be on the move at the deadline to figure out where -- if anywhere -- they could be traded. Among those big names is Giannis Antetokounmpo, who Quinn doesn't believe will be moved. \nQuinn: \"But with players of this caliber, logic often takes a back seat to emotion. Milwaukee doesn't want to admit that it's over, that the Bucks failed to adequately support the best player in franchise history. Antetokounmpo doesn't want to admit that it's over either, that for his competitive goals to be accomplishable, he'll have to pursue them outside of the only NBA city he's ever known. These aren't easy realizations to come to. So Antetokounmpo and the Bucks will take one more run at this thing. They'll probably make a token win-now trade at the deadline, likely taking in a bad contract they'll regret soon enough. And then, this thing will get settled once and for all over the summer.\"Meanwhile, Knicks owner James Dolan, who last spoke publicly three years ago, did a rare radio interview Monday evening and said that he was not aware of any attempt to get Antetokounmpo to New York. But Milwaukee's star is not the only NBA star who could wind up with a new address. There are rumors that a Trae Young to Washington deal would make sense for both the Hawks and Wizards.  👊 A playlist of great UFC fights to kick off the Paramount+ era \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            UFC's Paramount+ era kicked off on Jan. 1, with the iconic mixed martial arts program set to stream every event live on Paramount+, a move that also signaled the end of pay-per-view events. The partnership is a massive gamechanger for the sport, and it's likely that some of you reading this are not familiar with the sport. With that in mind, I put together a playlist of 10 great UFC fights as an introduction to the sport. The choices stretch over two decades of action and feature nothing but the kind of fights that get your blood pumping. These fights are better than a cup of coffee to get you over a sluggish start to a day in the middle of the week. Here's a look at one of the entries. \nBrookhouse: \"Forrest Griffin vs. Stephan Bonnar, The Ultimate Fighter 1 Finale (April 9, 2005)  \"What better place to start the playlist than with the fight UFC CEO Dana White credits with saving the UFC? The Fertittas and White had seen their attempts to grow the UFC stall out when they took a last-ditch shot in the most 2005 way possible: a reality show. 'The Ultimate Fighter' drew in viewers for the standard reality show drama, but it also allowed those viewers to connect with the type of men who enter into a cage to punch, kick, elbow, knee and twist another's limbs. The whole thing led to the live finale on Spike TV (the same network that aired the weekly episodes) and Griffin and Bonnar meeting in the light heavyweight finals. The two men went to war in a fight that generated a ton of buzz, led to a renewal order for the show on Spike and UFC contracts for both men. While it was briefly trendy for MMA fans to claim the fight wasn't great for lacking high-level techniques, it's a brutal example of the kind of fight that speaks to a primitive part of the brain.\" 👍👎 The best (and not-so-best) of the rest \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Still stunned from a last-second loss to the Steelers that kept the Ravens out of the playoffs, Baltimore quarterback Lamar Jackson was not ready to speak about his future on Sunday night.Meanwhile, Ravens kicker Tyler Loop said he simply mishit the ball on the field goal that could have won Baltimore the division.Following Stefanski's firing, the future is uncertain for quarterback Shedeur Sanders. Sanders addressed his time working under his now-former coach.Keeping things in the Sanders family, Deion Sanders is facing the most pivotal transfer portal window of his time coaching at Colorado.The Steelers are getting wideout DK Metcalf back ahead of their wild card playoff game with the Texans, though Metcalf declined to discuss the incident with a Lions fan that resulted in a two-game suspension.Ruben Amorim was fired by Manchester United.

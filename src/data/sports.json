    "body": "\n        The first round of the 2025 College football Playoff concludes on Saturday night when the No. 5 Oregon Ducks host the No. 12 James Madison Dukes. James Madison, the Sun Belt champion, got a spot in the CFP bracket thanks in large part to Duke upsetting Virginia in the ACC title game, making JMU one of the five highest-ranked conference champions. Oregon had a strong 11-1 campaign, but didn't hold a tiebreaker to get into the Big Ten title game. The winner advances to face No. 4 Texas Tech in the Orange Bowl on New Year's Day. Kickoff from Autzen Stadium is set for 7:30 p.m. ET. The Ducks are 20.5-point favorites in the latest Oregon vs. James Madison odds, while the over/under is 45.5.

Oregon is the largest favorite to this point in any bowl or playoff game, and that's because the Ducks own a huge talent edge across the board and will be playing on their home field. Quarterback Dante Moore is a possible top pick in the 2026 NFL Draft as he comes into this matchup with 2,733 passing yards, 24 touchdown passes and just six interceptions on the season. Dan Lanning's squad also ranked third in the Big Ten in scoring defense (14.8 points per game) and will present a challenge that James Madison isn't accustomed to. See which side to back at SportsLine.New users can check out the latest bet365 bonus code to get $150 in bonus bets after placing a $5 bet:Why James Madison can coverJMU went 8-5 against the spread this season and the Dukes were 1-0 ATS as road underdogs -- covering at Louisville earlier in the season. The Dukes are built to run the ball, leading the Sun Belt with 245.7 yards per game on the ground. Running back Wayne Knight led the way with 1,263 rushing yards, while quarterback Alonza Barnett III had 544 yards and 14 scores on the ground. That proficiency on the ground could shrink this game and give the three-score underdog a chance to keep this one within the number against an Oregon team that was blown out in its only CFP game last season.

Bruce Marshall, who is 45-26-2 over his last 73 NFL ATS picks, is backing the Chargers (+1.5) to cover versus the Cowboys on Sunday.\"Dallas should have had more left in the tank for last Sunday's 34-26 loss to the Vikings, and the defense is starting to resemble its poor form from the first half of the season while allowing 39 ppg in consecutive losses to the Lions and Vikes,\" said Marshall. \"As for the Bolts, they're still playing inspired defense while continuing to chase Denver in the AFC West, and Justin Herbert's left wrist has had another week to heal and get him closer to 100%. This is arguably a tougher test for Dallas than others they didn't pass the past two weeks.

R.J. White is +585 on his past 281 NFL picks, and he's backing Jalen Hurts as an anytime TD scorer in the early kick. \"The Eagles finally got back on track against the Raiders, and this is another good matchup for their offense,\" White said. \"The Washington defense has allowed 3+ TDs in every game played stateside since Week 6, and giving up 21 points and 384 yards to the Giants last week represents one of their best outings in that stretch. We're used to seeing Hurts' ATD prop at much shorter odds in this type of matchup, and even if Lane Johnson isn't able to make it back this week, I think he shouldn't be plus odds to score against a defense that gives up loads of points.\" Get more Eagles vs. Commanders picks here and see Packers vs. Bears picks right here. Patriots vs. Ravens 'Sunday Night Football' picks An important AFC matchups unfolds on Sunday night when the Ravens host the Patriots. The Pats (11-2) currently are the No. 2 seed in the AFC, while the Ravens (7-6) would be just outside the field if the playoffs started now. Claudia Bellofatto has nailed four of her past five NFL player prop picks, and she's backing Drake Maye to go Over on his passing yards on 'SNF.'\"He's cashed this in all but two of the last 10 and he's now facing a Ravens defense allowing the 5th most attempts and over 245 yards a game. We should get either a close game or negative game script to help us get over. Last week was only Maye's second game all season dipping 60% or less on completion percentage. He still leads the league in that category as well as being 2nd in yards per attempt. Plus, he's 3-0 straight up and ATS in career primetime games. I like a bounce back for the Pats MVP and possibly the league's, if he can catch back up to Stafford.\" See more Eagles vs. Ravens picks here.Pick Maye to go Over 242.5 passing yards at DraftKings:\n            ",

It was also the coaching debut for Pete Golding at Ole Miss, as the Rebels' defensive coordinator was promoted following Lane Kiffin's sudden exit to become the next coach at LSU.Despite Kiffin no longer being with the program, he still benefited financially from the Rebels' playoff win. That's because, as part of the agreement of Kiffin leaving Ole Miss before its CFP run, LSU agreed to pay his playoff bonuses if the Rebels kept advancing.That means that Kiffin earned $250,000 from LSU on Saturday thanks to the Rebels. If Ole Miss wins the national title, Kiffin could earn up to $1 million.\n        \n            \n                Lane Kiffin's return to Ole Miss with LSU set for September 2026 as SEC releases complete football schedule\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe former Ole Miss coach signed a seven-year deal worth $91 million in Baton Rouge, which comes with opportunities to earn more via incentives, according to records obtained by The Advocate.

Booker was flagged for roughing the passer for the contact to Love's head.\nThe Packers confirmed that Love was undergoing evaluation for a concussion and listed his possible return to the pivotal NFC North game as questionable. As the second half began, the Packers confirmed that Love had been ruled out for the remainder of the game with a concussion.\nBackup quarterback Malik Willis entered the game following Love's injury.

    "body": "\n        Texas Tech entered this season believing it had the pieces to win a national championship, but so far, its defense had not been up to par and injuries have ravaged the Red Raiders' ability to coalesce. Texas Tech entered Saturday's showdown against No. 3 Duke short-handed, bruised and off-kilter.It will leave Madison Square Garden with one of college basketball's biggest wins of the season. Texas Tech erased a 17-point, second-half deficit to stun Duke 82-81 and notch a resume-boosting win that sends a message to the rest of the Big 12 that this group is as dangerous as ever. JT Toppin played the final 11-plus minutes of the game with four fouls and managed to stay in the fight. The Red Raiders' All-American finished with 19 points, but it was Christian Anderson who sored 23 of his 27 points in the second half points to spark the comeback. LeJuan Watts also chipped in 20 massive points to help Texas Tech (9-3) stay above water without injured center Luke Bamgboye.Duke (11-1) got 23 points from Cameron Boozer and 13 more from twin brother Cayden, but the Blue Devils' offense scored just three points in a five-minute span down the stretch to breathe life into Texas Tech's rally.\nWith the loss, Duke fell from the unbeaten ranks. Only Michigan, Iowa State, Arizona, Vanderbilt, Nebraska and Miami (Ohio) remain unblemished.    Let's dive into some takeaways of Texas Tech's upset of Duke.Texas Tech's Big Three emergesWe knew Toppin and Anderson were expected to be brilliant, and so far, that duo has been up to the task. Saturday was no different. One of the nation's best inside-out duos combined for 46 points against a Duke defense that had been vicious all year. But Watts has become a revelation offensively in recent weeks after focusing exclusively on … his defense? The basketball Gods have blessed Texas Tech's bootyball machine, who racked up 20 points, six rebounds and three dimes in 27 minutes against the Blue Devils.\nWhen Toppin, Anderson and Watts are cooking, Texas Tech's offense is an incredibly tough cover.Duke learned that the hard way.Duke's defense disintegrates at the wrong timeDuke's defense picked a brutal time to play its worst defensive half of the season. The Blue Devils allowed 1.48 points per possession in the second half. Overall, it was the worst showing for Duke's defense this year … by a country mile.\nTexas: 0.90Michigan State: 0.93Kansas: 1.00Arkansas: 1.01Florida: 1.01Texas Tech: 1.16Big 12 race is shaping up to be a bangerTexas Tech has certainly proven its best 40 minutes can knock off anybody, and it's setting the stage for an all-time Big 12 race. Iowa State and Arizona are unbelievable. Houston, fresh off dismantling Arkansas, is starting to play very well. BYU and Kansas have two elite talents. A bloodbath awaits.\n            ",

Some of these injuries have caused a major shift in NFL betting lines, particularly in an AFC clash between the Chiefs and Titans.

The Chiefs will now play out the rest of the season without Patrick Mahomes, who tore his ACL last week in a loss to the Chargers.

Another game with big line movement is Bengals vs. Dolphins, and not because of injury -- the Dolphins officially benched Tua Tagovailoa.A very important NFC South matchup between the Buccaneers and Panthers has also seen some line movement, while things hold steady for a big clash between the Chargers and Cowboys as Dallas clings to a thread of playoff hope.\nLines are typically sharp this deep into the season, but injuries and quarterback changes can shake things up a lot. There has been some notable NFL line movement in Week 16. Here, we will break down the games that have seen the biggest shifts since lines first opened, with all odds courtesy of DraftKings Sportsbook.Chiefs vs. Titans (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET)Open: Chiefs -10.5, O/U 40.5Now: Chiefs -3, O/U 37.5\nKansas City had a terrible Week 15, getting eliminated from the playoffs for the first time since 2014 and losing their star quarterback. Gardner Minshew, who threw an interception in his first attempt in last week's 16-13 loss to the Chargers, will start in place of Mahomes. Fortunately for Chiefs fans, the Titans have the second-worst offense in the NFL, averaging just 244 yards and 1.6 points per game. They allow 356.6 yards (27th) and 28.1 points (28th), and K.C.'s defense is far superior. The Chiefs allow 19.1 points per game, fifth-best in the league. Tennessee has won two games, with the only one in their past nine coming against the 3-11 Browns. Bengals vs. Dolphins (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET)\nOpen: Bengals -1.5, O/U 50.5Now: Bengals -4.5, O/U 47.5 \nWith Tagovailoa benched, rookie Quinn Ewers gets the start, but Miami was going into this one as an underdog regardless. Joe Burrow and Ja'Marr Chase, who has 1,147 receiving yards despite Burrow missing nine games, can still cause defenses major headaches. The Dolphins defense isn't great, allowing 334.6 yards per game (19th), and the Cincinnati unit is historically bad, allowing a league-worst 403.8 yards and 31.2 points per game. The fact Miami is starting a rookie QB is the only thing keeping this total low, as it opened as the second-highest on the board to Chargers vs. Cowboys.Buccaneers vs. Panthers (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET)\nOpen: Bucs -1.5, O/U 45.5Now: Bucs -3, O/U 45.5\nThis is another massive divisional matchup in Week 16 as these teams sit atop the NFC South at 7-7. That means a division title is the only path to the playoffs and while the teams meet again in Week 18, winning this one is the first step. The Bucs have lost five of their past six, but the offense looked strong as several key pieces returned against the Falcons. Unfortunately, the defense gave up 476 yards, but Carolina's offense isn't nearly as strong as Atlanta's. Carolina scores 19 points per game, fifth-fewest in the league, and Tampa Bay has won five in a row against the Panthers.Falcons vs. Cardinals (Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET)\nOpen: Falcons -1.5, O/U 46.5Now: Falcons -3, O/U 48.5\nKirk Cousins lit up the Bucs last week, throwing for 373 yards and three touchdowns, and the Cardinals defense isn't much better. In fact, it is far worse against the run, and Bijan Robinson ran for 93 yards and a score for the Falcons at Tampa Bay. He also had 82 receiving yards and leads the NFL with 1,858 yards from scrimmage. Both teams are in the bottom half of the league in scoring, with Arizona averaging 21.6 points and Atlanta scoring 20.1. Same with the defenses, with the Falcons yielding 24.4 and the Cards 27.7. That's why the total has gone Over in five of Arizona's past six games.  \n            ",

    "body": "\nThere's nothing like a good hot streak in December when it comes to picking NFL games. For me, it's been a bit of a heater.I went 11-5 both straight up and against the spread last week, which has me feeling optimistic heading down the stretch of the regular season.For the season, I am now 117-106-1 ATS and 151-72-1 straight up. To be 11 games over .500 picking every game each week is quite a feat, if I don't say so myself.Let's hope as the weather gets frigid around the country, I can stay as hot as a July day at the beach.All Week 16 NFL betting lines via DraftKings Sportsbook.Buffalo Bills (-10.5) at Cleveland BrownsSunday, 1 p.m. ET CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThe Bills are coming off a big road victory over the Patriots and now play a second-consecutive road game against a team they should beat. Motivation could be key, but the Browns have offensive issues. Look for the Bills to take care of things in this one early to win it behind another strong game by Josh Allen. Pick: Bills 27, Browns 14Cincinnati Bengals at Miami Dolphins (+4.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThe Bengals were shut out by the Ravens last week and eliminated from playoff contention, while Miami lost to the Steelers Monday night to also be eliminated. So this game means nothing. With that as a backdrop, give me Miami at home. De'Von Achane will run it wild and have a big day. Pick: Dolphins 30, Bengals 26Kansas City Chiefs (-3) at Tennessee TitansSunday, 1 p.m. ET CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThe Chiefs have been eliminated from the playoffs and Patrick Mahomes is lost for the season. How focused will they be here? Does it matter. The Titans are bad and Gardner Minshew is more than capable of having a solid game. Chiefs win it. Pick: Chiefs 24, Titans 17Los Angeles Chargers at Dallas Cowboys (-1.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Chargers have won two straight, while the Cowboys have lost two straight. Dallas is barely alive in the playoff race, and could be eliminated Saturday night if the Eagles win, while the Chargers are surging. But after beating the Chiefs last week, this could be a letdown spot for the Chargers. Dallas can score and I think they will here. Cowboys take it. Pick: Cowboys 33, Chargers 27Minnesota Vikings at New York Giants (+2.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Vikings are playing consecutive road games, but they played well at Dallas. The Giants didn't look good in the home loss to the Commanders last week. But I think they bounce back here and the defense plays better against J.J. McCarthy. The Giants win it at home. Pick: Giants 24, Vikings 20New York Jets at New Orleans Saints (-6.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThe Jets are out on the road for the second straight week, which is never an easy thing for a bad team playing for nothing. The Saints have showed some fight the past month, which I think continues in this one. Tyler Shough has played well and the Jets have little in terms of offense. Saints win it.Pick: Saints 27, Jets 10Tampa Bay Buccaneers (-3) at Carolina PanthersSunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThis is for first place in the division. Both teams are coming off bad losses that have them at 7-7 and tied for the division lead. The Bucs have not played well on defense as of late, but the Carolina offense isn't great. Look for Baker Mayfield and the Bucs offense to get the best of the Carolina defense, while Bryce Young can't keep up. Pick: Buccaneers 23, Panthers 19Atlanta Falcons (-3) at Arizona CardinalsSunday, 4:05 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThese two are among the biggest disappointments of the year. The Cardinals are decimated by injuries, which shows up on defense. The Falcons showed they could score against Tampa Bay with Kirk Cousins at quarterback and that will continue in this one. Falcons win it. Pick: Falcons 34, Cardinals 23Jacksonville Jaguars at Denver Broncos (-3.5)Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThis is the one of the games of the week, featuring the top-seed Broncos against the third-seeded Jaguars. Both teams are playing much better on offense as of late, which could make this fun to watch. This a big proving game for the young Jaguars and I think they can come in and win it with a big day from Trevor Lawrence. Pick: Jaguars 27, Broncos 26Las Vegas Raiders at Houston Texans (-14.5)Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET CBS (Stream on Paramount+) \nThe Raiders are bad right now with little semblance of an offense, while the Texans are the best defense in the league. That's a bad combination. The Raiders are also playing consecutive road games with no chance for the playoffs, while the Texans would be in the postseason right now and need it. Texans in a blowout. Pick: Texans 31, Raiders 9Pittsburgh Steelers (+6.5) at Detroit LionsSunday, 4:25 p.m. ET CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThis is a big game for both in their playoff quest. The Lions lost last week, while the Steelers are coming off a Monday night win over the Dolphins. The Steelers defense played well in that one, but this is a big step up in terms of matching offensive firepower. Both teams will score, but the Lions will get more.Pick: Lions 33, Steelers 27New England Patriots at Baltimore Ravens (-3)Sunday, 8:20 p.m. ET on NBC\nThe Patriots are coming off a tough loss at home against the Bills and now must head out to play a Ravens team that shut out the Bengals last week. The Ravens are also more desperate in the playoff race, which matters. Lamar Jackson wins it as the Patriots drop their second straight. Pick: Ravens 30, Patriots 26San Francisco 49ers at Indianapolis Colts (+5.5)Monday, 8:15 p.m. ET on ESPN/ABC (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThis will be the second start for Philip Rivers for the Colts after he almost won at Seattle last week. The 49ers are 10-4 and pushing for a playoff spot. They blew out Tennessee last week, but the defense wasn't great. It won't matter as the 49ers will limit Rivers and Brock Purdy will play well. The 49ers keep on winning.Pick: 49ers 27, Colts 23\n            ",

Watt will miss his second consecutive game after undergoing surgery to repair a partially collapsed lung suffered while getting treatment at the team facility. However, Mike Tomlin hasn't shut the door on a Week 17 return for Watt.While Watt wasn't practicing this week, he was back at the team's facility and doing some \"cardio,\" Tomlin told CBS Sports' Tracy Wolfson. With Watt back in the facility, the Steelers are \"hopeful\" their star pass rusher will be back on the field next week when they take on the Cleveland Browns.Watt went to Pittsburgh area hospital last Wednesday after he experienced discomfort in his chest after a dry needling treatment session. He is expected to return to the field this season, per NFL Network. The 31-year-old Watt is in the middle of his ninth season with the Steelers, who selected him with the 30th overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft. A seven-time Pro Bowler and four-time All-Pro, Watt won NFL Defensive Player of the Year honors in 2021 after tying the league's single-season record of 22.5 sacks. Watt, who has led the NFL in sacks on three separate occasions, is the Steelers' career leader with 115 sacks. He surpassed brother and future Hall of Famer JJ Watt on the NFL's career sack list this season. \nIn 13 games this season, Watt has seven sacks, three forced fumbles, two fumble recoveries and an interception. With Watt and Nick Herbig (hamstring) out, the Steelers' pass rush will likely lean heavily on veteran Alex Highsmith and rookie Jack Sawyer during Sunday's game against the Detroit Lions. The Steelers are 8-6 and lead the Baltimore Ravens by one game in the AFC North standings. Highsmith is tied for second on the team with 6.5 sacks. Sawyer has one sack, an interception, 26 tackles and three pass breakups in 14 games. \n\"He's had some opportunities this year and has made some plays,\" Tomlin recently said of Sawyer. \"Has had a sack. Has had an interception. So, I wouldn't be surprised if he displays that readiness if he gets an expanded role opportunity this week.\"\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        After the first round of the College Football Playoff featured two rematches of regular season meetings we have another in the quarterfinals, as No. 3 seed Georgia will square off with No. 6 seed Ole Miss in the Sugar Bowl. The Rebels solidified their spot in New Orleans with a 41-10 win over Tulane on Saturday, logging what was not just the first-ever CFP win for the program but also a 1-0 start to the Pete Golding era in Oxford. Georgia won the first meeting 43-35, roaring back from a pair of second-half deficits and scoring the final 17 points of the game. Gunner Stockton was outstanding, throwing for four touchdowns and no interceptions while guiding the Bulldogs to 510 total yards of offense. Now we will see what has changed in the matchup since that Oct. 18 meeting in Athens, as both teams will have plenty of time to get ready for familiar opponents. For Kirby Smart's Bulldogs the Sugar Bowl also provides a chance to get the win that eluded them in last season's CFP opener. The Bulldogs had the No. 2 seed in last year's bracket as the SEC champions, but were knocked off by Notre Dame in the Sugar Bowl quarterfinal. Now they'll be in the same position, facing a team coming off an on-campus first-round win, but hoping to get a different result and make an appearance in the CFP semifinals for the first time since 2022-23.  Of course for Ole Miss the opportunity is more school history. The Rebels' 12 wins in 2025 is already the most all-time, and after getting the programs first-ever CFP win in its first-ever CFP appearance, every additional victory extends the accolades for this group. It will also be another big early challenge for new head coach Pete Golding, who with one more win could change the conversation about the ceiling for Ole Miss in this playoff. \nNow with the matchup set and the stakes established, let's get into what you need to know about the two teams in the Sugar Bowl quarterfinal.   \n    \n                                        \n    What to know about Georgia Georgia captured its third SEC Championship in the last four seasons on a back of a team that got better throughout the year, bouncing back from an early season loss to Alabama and winning nine straight games to enter the College Football Playoff with a 12-1 record. A win against the Crimson Tide in the SEC Championship Game gave Kirby Smart's crew the honor of saying that it had \"beat every team on its schedule\" this season, and now he takes aim at the pursuit of a third national championship ring. Georgia had the 14th-best point margin in the country this season (+16.0 points per game) but the style of wins evolved throughout the season and depending on opponent. The Bulldogs won shootouts against the likes of Tennessee and Ole Miss but also got big defensive performances in late-season wins against Texas, Georgia Tech and Alabama in the SEC Championship Game. Gunner Stockton has been a steady hand in his first full season as starting quarterback, throwing for 23 touchdowns and just five interceptions while carrying the SEC's second-best completion percentage at 70.7%. But a big story has also been the running back room, led by sophomore Nate Frazier who with 861 yards on the season already has the second-most productive rushing year for a Georgia back since 2020. The Bulldogs haven't had a 1,000-yard back since D'Andre Swift in 2019, but if the team's CFP stay extends beyond the Sugar Bowl that would certainly be in the cards for Frazier. \nUltimately the story of Georgia's season has been its resiliency. The Bulldogs trailed in six of their seven wins during the regular season against SEC opponents, with multiple second-half comebacks that include the eight-point win against Ole Miss back in October. The school's own game notes boast about how the team is \"hard to kill\" and Kirby Smart takes great pride in the fact that his team has frequently found ways to win, even when it isn't pretty. That could be a key factor in securing a win against a familiar foe, because it's well known that it can be difficult to beat a team twice in one season.  \n    \n                                        \n    What to know about Ole Miss The story of Ole Miss in 2025 will always have Lane Kiffin as the main character, but at this point the former Rebels (and current LSU) coach is going to fade in the backdrop to make room for Pete Golding and a team that's buzzing of its first-ever College Football Playoff win. The 41-10 rout of Tulane served as a celebratory and cathartic moment for all of Oxford, Mississippi, as Rebles fans packed Vaught-Hemingway Stadium and and were treated to a wire-to-wire win that cemented this group as an all-time Ole Miss team. Those same fans shouldn't have trouble making the short trip south to New Orleans, where the hopes of keeping this run going will create a lively atmosphere inside of the Superdome. Even though Lane Kiffin is off to LSU, Ole Miss and its transition offensive staff (led by Charlie Weis Jr.) still put together a game plan that allowed the Rebels to be successful against Tulane. Ole Miss entered the game averaging 37.3 points per game on the year and scored 41, which compared to the 45-10 win against Tulane earlier in the year suggests we should not expect that much of a drop-off in the midst of this coaching transition. \nThe rematch aspect of this should also be a key factor for Ole Miss and its defense, which new head coach Pete Golding certainly has had a big hand in throughout the year and will continue to in the Sugar Bowl. Georgia was one of just two Ole Miss opponents to total more than 500 yards and score more than 30 points against this Rebels defense, and the inability to get stops late in the game proved to be the deciding factor in letting a fourth quarter lead slip away. Ole Miss' defense was dominant against Tulane in the first-round win, but the jump up in weight class will be significant against the SEC champions. The win against Tulane did include injury scares for quarterback Trinidad Chambliss and star running back and 1,200-yard rusher Kewan Lacy, but both players did end up returning to action in the game. Those developments will be key to monitor for an Ole Miss offense that ranked No. 2 nationally in yards per game coming into the College Football Playoff and will be facing a Georgia defense that has improved since their first meeting. Odds below via FanDuel Sportsbook.Sugar Bowl odds, prediction There is an aspect of \"been there, done that\" to consider when looking at the rematch between these two teams. Georgia's senior class has a 51-5 record that includes a national title (2022) and three SEC championships (2022, 2024, 2025). Though the roster is littered with underclassmen as starters and contributors, the standard for excellence has been set and it seems unlikely that they will stand for another one-and-done showing in the College Football Playoff. Ultimately this is a team that's gotten better since an eight-point win in mid-October, and that should show up in a comfortable win in the rematch. Pick: Georgia -6.5\n            ",

    "body": "\n        NEWARK, N.J. — How do you make it to within one shot of winning a national title, bring back three key pieces from that team, start 10-1 and still float along the outskirts of the national radar?Only one way: You're the perpetually under-discussed Houston Cougars. I'm not saying it's right, I'm just saying it's how it is. Far too often. \"Don't sleep on Houston,\" Kelvin Sampson famously said on CBS last April after the Cougars stunned much of the college hoops world by ending Cooper Flagg's college career with the Coogs' epic come-from-behind 70-67 upset of top-seeded Duke in the Final Four.It's time to remind the world to wake up again. Maybe it's because Houston loves to win ugly. Maybe it's because its schedule hasn't been flashy so far. Maybe it's because the Cougars don't produce one-and-done talent (though, read on, because that's now no longer the case).But here we are again, amid another season, and Houston is one of the best teams in the country. \nDon't sleep on Houston.It's time to start paying game-by-game attention to the Cougars once more, as they are the most reliably successful team in college basketball and proved the notion true furthermore on Saturday with another physically authoritative, Houston-style win against overmatched Arkansas in the Never Forget Tribute Classic at the Prudential Center. The Cougars defeated the Razorbacks 94-85 to improve to 11-1, getting there behind 22 points from senior guard Emanuel Sharp and 21 more from freshman guard Kingston Flemings Jr.\nHouston entered the game with a No. 8 ranking; Arkansas had a 14 next to its name. The two teams didn't look as close as those numbers would suggest. Arkansas was within breathing distance for the entire second half, but never threatened after Houston broke the game open by ripping off a 15-0 run to get the score to 41-19 in the first half. The game teetered there. The only reason it wasn't a blowout was thanks to the play of Arkansas freshman point Darius Acuff Jr., who kept the gap from becoming a chasm. \nAcuff, who may well be a lottery pick in next June's NBA Draft, finished with 27 points and seven assists, both game-highs. \"We were up 49-41, and it seemed like we played our worst basketball the last three minutes (of the first half),\" Sampson said. \"But we had some cards to play because we could space the floor.\" John Calipari and Kelvin Sampson have 70 Seasons and 1,600-plus wins between them, but this was just the second time they'd ever matched wits (Calipari got the better of Sampson in the 2018 NCAA Tournament). For Arkansas, Saturday was a missed opportunity. The Hogs are 9-3, but a victory here would have surely bumped their reputation up a tier. Instead, they're one of six or seven teams with talent that are jumbled near the top of the SEC, which will start league play in two weeks. \nHouston's in a much rosier position. The Big 12 is stacked with the likes of Arizona, Iowa State, BYU and even Kansas. It hasn't dropped a bit from its perch in this sport. The answer as to why Houston wasn't getting more attention is their schedule. Saturday's win logs as just the second Quad 1 victory for UH through 12 games, joining the Nov. 16 73-72 defeat of Auburn in Birmingham, Alabama. Beating Arkansas also improved the Coogs to 7-1 in their last eight games in top-15 matchups.This is what Sampson's teams do. Win way more than they lose, and when they win, they hurt you and tend not to make it close. \nYou might've forgotten it amid the crunch of incredible November games, but Houston's only loss came by three at Players Era in Vegas. I was there; Tennessee might not play a better overall game this season. And the Vols are obviously of good quality. That in mind, Houston having a lone single-possession loss against a team that might be a top-four seed shouldn't displace them from the conversation of who's elite in this terrific season. Houston's adaptability Saturday was also admirable. Arkansas came into the game averaging 89.9 points, and it got close to that, but Houston had no problem making it a track meet. The game had 73 possessions, the most Houston's played in regulation since the start of the 2024-25 season. I know Sampson abhors seeing another team hit 80-plus on his guys, but having this kind of win will serve Houston well in the next three months.\"It speaks to Arkansas' talent that they scored 85 points,\" Sampson said. \"They're good enough to do that, and thank goodness we were good enough to score 94.\"\nHouston's 94 points were the program's most against a ranked team in regulation in 15 years.The Cougars stymied the run-happy Hogs, who came into the game ranked No. 2 in fast break points at 22.7 per night. On this night, a mere seven — which is a half-point more than Houston gives up per game.\"I think that was the first time we played zone since I was at Montana Tech,\" Sampson said, following with some admitted facetiousness. \"We went 1-2-2, back to 3-2, bought us some possessions. It'll never be our fastball, but it's nice to know you've got a curveball.\"\nHouston knew it would have its moments on the offensive glass — Arkansas allows 16 per game in second-chance opportunities — and voila: Cougars got 16 on the board after securing 12 offensive rebounds.No matter the cut-off you want to use, Houston leads all teams in college basketball in win total in the past five, six, seven, eight years. It's no surprise the Cougars are this formidable once more. While they don't rate top-five in efficiency just yet, their DNA puts them in a deep pool of teams that includes undefeateds such as Arizona, Michigan and Iowa State. Then the one-loss bullies are Houston, Duke, UConn, Gonzaga, Purdue, Michigan State and North Carolina. (Undefeated Vanderbilt may well be in that class as well, but it's yet to beat a top-30 team.)Getting Sharp, Uzan and Tugler back, with that Final Four experience, is huge. But the addition of Flemings is what changes the dynamics in play. He's a rangy lead guard who was ranked 20th in his high school class and has already outplayed that projection. He's putting up better than 15 points, five assists and shooting almost 60%. \nHouston's always been good/great under Sampson. Always been tough. Always been opportunistic. Always had a swagger. Kingston makes them dangerous. Uzan and Sharp are capable of taking and making the big shot, but Flemings is the guy who is the key to keeping Houston just as good this season as it was last season, and the one before that, and the one before that. But even more? He's talented enough to make Houston believe that getting back to a national championship game should be the expectation, not the hope. \n\"How good can we be? I never think about that. I just know that we can get better,\" Sampson said. This is Houston merely at its good. We know Houston when it's great, and this group has the stuff to be great. The Cougars' most impressive personality trait is how they reliably get stronger the more games they play. We're one-third of the way through the college basketball season and Houston might be 60% or 70% of its potential. Keep your eyes on these guys because they've clearly got their eyes on the prize: Sampson has himself a national title contender yet again.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Kentucky big man Jayden Quaintance, a projected lottery pick in the 2026 NBA Draft, made his season debut Saturday during the Wildcats' 78-66 win against St. John's in the CBS Sports Classic. Quaintance, who transferred from Arizona State this past offseason, logged 17 minutes and finished with 10 points, eight rebounds and two blocks.Quaintance, who transferred from Arizona State this past offseason, was recovering from a torn ACL that was repaired in March.\"This has been a long time in the making,\" Quaintance said. \"I've been a competitor my whole life. I was always raised competing, That's all I ever wanted to do. I continued to trust my guys and I feel like that trust in guys built just being here on the bench, it kind of translated over. (It) showed on the court.\"The Wildcats are off to a 8-4 start in Pope's second season at his alma mater. Entering the weekend, Kentucky was coming off back-to-back wins over NC Central and Indiana after suffering a 35-point loss to Gonzaga earlier this month. Before the comeback win over Indiana, Kentucky's best win this season was against Valparaiso.\n\"It's just been slow for us to grow up and embrace who exactly we are, and we're in that process,\" Pope said. \"We're in the early stages of that process. This is an important day for us because we know back-to-back games, seeing some real physicality and some smash mouth basketball. Sometimes it's ugly, but sometimes it's beautiful like it was at moments in the second half of this game.\"Quaintance averaged 9.4 points, 7.9 rebounds and 2.6 blocks during the 2024-25 campaign at ASU while being the youngest player in Division l basketball. He would've been the third-youngest player in last year's McDonald's All-American Game had he stayed in his original high school recruiting class.\nWhat makes Quaintance an elite NBA prospectQuaintance's calling card is his defense. Despite being the youngest player in Division I basketball last season, he played like one of the best defenders in the country. Although some of Kentucky's struggles and slow start can be attributed to the team's 3-point shooting regression, it doesn't hurt to bring Quaintance into the fold. \nIt wouldn't be surprising to see Quaintance eased back into action -- like he was against St. John's -- before eventually being promoted back to the starting lineup.\"When he goes (in), he's going to be on restriction, for sure,\" Pope said earlier this week. \"There's the conditioning part, when you haven't hit guys and run around and change direction and respond to the unpredictable movements. Fatigue is your enemy. It's fatigue with every part of your body, some of your natural instincts are just going to be declined, right? That's shaking off the rust.\"In the CBS Sports NBA Draft Prospect Rankings, Quaintance is ranked No. 7 overall and is the highest-ranked non-freshman on the list.\nQuaintance, who just turned 18 this past July, was ineligible for the 2025 NBA Draft due to his age. NBA rules state that a player must be at least 19 years old during the calendar year of the draft, which opened the door for Quaintance to play two seasons in college. If Quaintance were eligible this past summer, he would've surely been a top 10 selection.Quaintance unique entry in transfer portal eraQuaintance originally signed to play for John Calipari but backed off that pledge after the former UK coach took the vacant job at Arkansas. The former No. 9 overall player in the 2024 recruiting cycle, according to 247Sports, committed shortly after to Arizona State and became the highest-ranked recruit in program history.Since the 2021 NBA Draft, the highest-drafted player who previously entered the transfer portal was Davion Mitchell, who started his career at Auburn before transferring to Baylor. Mitchell improved his draft stock significantly under coach Scott Drew and was drafted No. 9 overall by the Sacramento Kings.\nCedric Coward, who was selected No. 11 overall by the Memphis Grizzlies this past summer, was one of the highest-drafted players in the transfer portal era. He transferred from Eastern Washington to Washington State before becoming a lottery pick. In fact, Coward entered the transfer portal again after the end of last season and committed to Duke before electing to keep his name in the draft.The highest-drafted transfer last summer was former Providence star Devin Carter, who started his career at South Carolina and was drafted No. 12 by the Kings in the 2024 NBA Draft. Other first-round picks in that 2024 draft class who started their college career elsewhere were Kel'el Ware (Oregon to Indiana), Dalton Knecht (Northern Colorado to Tennessee), Jaylon Tyson (Texas Tech to Cal), Terrence Shannon Jr. (Texas Tech to Illinois) and Baylor Scheierman (South Dakota State to Creighton).The 2026 NBA Draft is expected to be among the best and deepest classes in recent memory. However, with Quaintance returning before the calendar flips to 2026, he has a chance to separate himself and show why he is one of the true blue-chip prospects in the draft.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        It has been seven weeks since the World Series ended and so far only three of our top 10 free agents have signed and two of our top 25 trade candidates have been moved. A slow offseason, this has been, though we did get a three-team trade Friday. Perhaps that's a sign the hot stove is about to heat up. Here now are Saturday's rumors. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Pirates hope to add another batEven after picking up Brandon Lowe, the Pirates hope to add what GM Ben Cherington called a \"proven bat,\" according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Third base and DH could use an upgrade, possibly left field as well. Really, everything should be on the table after the Pirates scored the fewest runs and hit the fewest home runs in baseball in 2025.FanGraphs estimates the club's 2026 payroll at $82 million, including arbitration projections. It was $87 million in 2025. If they hold steady at the same payroll level next year, there's not much room to spend. The Pirates have signaled a willingness to spend big this offseason (their Kyle Schwarber pursuit, etc.), so perhaps Cherington & Co. still have plenty of financial wiggle room.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     \tPhillies pursuing catcher trades As talks with free agent J.T. Realmuto have failed to progress, the Phillies have begun to explore the trade market for a catcher, reports The Athletic. Philadelphia is said to have an offer on the table for Realmuto. Ultimately, a reunion makes sense for both sides, but a deal hasn't come together yet, so the Phillies are exploring their options. \nThe best free agent catcher behind Realmuto is Victor Caratini, who plays first base and DH as much as he catches these days. As for the trade market, Twins backstop Ryan Jeffers is an obvious candidate to be moved. He's a year away from free agency and the Twins sold hard at this summer's trade deadline. We ranked Realmuto as the 13th best free agent available this offseason. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Orioles interested in Romero \nThe Orioles are among the teams with interest in Cardinals lefty reliever JoJo Romero, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Romero is a year away from free agency and thus an obvious trade candidate with the Cardinals not prioritizing contention in 2026. The O's have already added righties Ryan Helsley and Andrew Kittredge to their bullpen this offseason. \nRomero, 29, is a sinker specialist with a knack for limiting homers. Baltimore has two lefties, Keegan Akin and Dietrich Enns, in their bullpen, though neither is a late-inning matchup specialist. A quality lefty reliever is a necessity in the AL East, which houses quality lefty bats Roman Anthony, Jonathan Aranda, Jazz Chisholm Jr., Jarren Duran, Ben Rice, Daulton Varsho, and others. \n            ",

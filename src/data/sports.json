    "body": "\n        One of WWE's signature events is back with some of the biggest stars imaginable. WWE Survivor Series goes down on Saturday night in San Diego with the imaginative format taking center stage once again in WarGames. There will be two WarGames matches taking place at Petco Park -- the fourth straight year the stipulation has been used -- in the men's and women's divisions, and will have names like Roman Reigns, Brock Lesnar, Cody Rhodes, CM Punk, AJ Lee, Rhea Ripley and Charlotte Flair in action.The teams could provide some interesting drama, both internally and externally. Reigns, Rhodes and Punk have their own storyline developing as Reigns has his eyes on getting back in the world title scene while being joined by his cousins, The Usos, to form the five-man team. Meanwhile, Paul Heyman has assembled a powerhouse unit, headlined by Lesnar, who is joined by Drew McIntyre, Logan Paul, Bron Breakker and Bronson Reed.On the women's side, Lee, Ripley, Flair, Alexa Bliss and Iyo Sky will have their hands full with Nia Jax Lash Legend Asuka, Kairi Sane and Lynch.\nSurvivor Series also features the penultimate stop in John Cena's retirement tour. The new intercontinental champion wrestles his last pay-per-view match, granting Dominik Mysterio a rematch before turning his attention to the winner of The Last Time is Now tournament.Plus, women's world champion Stephanie Vaquer has quite the challenge on her hands when she takes on former friend Nikki Bella with the title on the line. Bella turned her back on Vaquer after beginning to mentor the wrestler in her first year up from NXT. Now, the Hall of Famer has gold on her mind in her first world title match in nearly a decade.Take a look below at the confirmed matches for Survivor Series and take a glance at the crystal ball of what may come. The event streams live on ESPN Unlimited starting at 7 p.m. ET.\n2025 WWE Survivor Series matchesCM Punk, Cody Rhodes, The Usos (Jey Uso & Jimmy Uso) and Roman Reigns vs. The Vision (Bron Breakker, Bronson Reed & Logan Paul), Drew McIntyre and Brock Lesnar (WarGames match): Survivor Series' main event must have taken a turn after Seth Rollins suffered an injury at Crown Jewel. The Vision now moves on without him, forming an alliance with Logan Paul in the process. On Nov. 14, McIntyre joined The Vision's team to circumvent a suspension handed to him by SmackDown general manager Nick Aldis. The final spots on each team were claimed by Lesnar, siding with Heyman's group, and Reigns reuniting with his cousins. On the last Raw before Survivor Series, McIntyre and Paul won a match, earning their team the advantage.Rhea Ripley, Iyo Sky, Alexa Bliss, Charlotte Flair and AJ Lee vs. Nia Jax, Lash Legend, The Kabuki Warriors (Asuka & Kairi Sane) and Becky Lynch: Multiple rivalries come to a head in this year's women's WarGames match. Ripley and Sky have been feuding with the Kabuki Warriors. WWE women's tag team champions Bliss and Flair have sparked up a fresh rivalry with the new tandem of Jax and Lash. After the match was booked, Flair exited her team, claiming she couldn't trust Ripley. That leaves two spots to fill on Ripley's team, and one for Jax's. Flair and Ripley eventually patched things up, bolstering their ranks with Lee, while Jax and company enlisted Lynch. On the final SmackDown before Survivor Series, Flair defeated Asuka to win her team the advantage.Intercontinental Championship -- John Cena (c) vs. Dominik Mysterio: Cena is a first-ballot Hall of Famer, and the first 17-time world champion recognized by WWE, but until recently, he was not a Grand Slam champion. That's because the intercontinental title has surprisingly eluded him for two decades. On Nov. 10, Cena defeated Mysterio in an impromptu match for the intercontinental title. They will have their rematch at Survivor Series.\nWomen's World Championship -- Stephanie Vaquer (c) vs. Nikki Bella: Bella is going nowhere. Three months after a failed bid for the women's intercontinental title, Bella struck Vaquer from behind. Her villainous turn sets the stage for Vaquer's next title defense at a cornerstone WWE pay-per-view.\n            ",

It appeared as if the official bumped into Barham after Barham tackled Ohio State running back CJ Donaldson for a loss on second-and-goal from Michigan's 3-yard line. Barham then engaged with the official and contacted the official's face with his helmet. The ensuing unsportsmanlike penalty on Barham gave Ohio State an automatic first-and-goal, though the Buckeyes were forced to settle for a 25-yard field goal that cut Michigan's lead to 6-3 with 4:33 remaining in the first quarter. Despite making contact with the official, Barham was not ejected as a result of the penalty. \nBarham, who had one tackle in the first quarter, has been one of Michigan's top defenders this season. He entered Saturday's regular season finale with 31 total tackles, including 10 for a loss, and four sacks. He also has five quarterback hurries and three pass breakups. \nMichigan is looking for its fifth consecutive win over the Buckeyes, which would be its longest streak in the series since 1922-27. A victory would also boost Michigan's chances of receiving an at-large bid in the College Football Playoff. \n            \n    ",

An expansion franchise, San Diego are redefining what an expansion side can do under manager Mikey Varas, and behind the hot form of newcomer of the year Anders Dreyer, they'll host a Western Conference final with quite a bit of star power in tow.How to watch San Diego FC vs. Vancouver Whitecaps, oddsDate: Saturday, Nov. 29 | Time: 9 p.m. ETLocation: Snapdragon Stadium -- San Diego, Calif.Live stream: MLS Season PassOdds: San Diego FC +140; Draw +250; Vancouver Whitecaps +175Vancouver and manager Jesper Sorensen have had to withstand injuries and sales of key cogs of the team, but with Sebastian Berhalter leading the charge in midfield and Thomas Muller's hot form since joining midseason as a free agent. Including the playoffs, Muller has eight goals and three assists in only 10 appearances for the squad, and in a playoff scene that has been largely dominated by Lionel Messi in the Eastern Conference, he's making sure that his impact is felt while the Whitecaps look to bring Vancouver its first major professional title in sports.They did win the North American Soccer League in 1979, defeating the Tampa Bay Rowdies, but outside of the Canadian Cup, silverware has been hard to come by since. The Whitecaps made it to the Concacaf Champions Cup final this season under Sorensen, where they fell to Cruz Azul. That 5-0 loss will be far in the past, but it is a game that will help prepare the Whitecaps for an important match away from home with a trip to the MLS Cup on the line.San Diego are only the second expansion team in MLS history to reach a conference final, and they've taken down whatever has been in their path. Dreyer's impact has been important but so has Varas's trust in youth. Remember, 19-year-old Luca Bombino and 20-year-old Manu Duah have been critical parts of the defense, and they'll have an important job containing Brian White and the Vancouver attack. Dreyer has also scored four goals and assisted two more during the playoffs\nThis will be the third meeting between the two, with San Diego winning one and the other ending in a draw. There's quite a lot on the line as if Inter Miami fall to New York City FC, the winner of this match will host MLS Cup.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        We're still on Thanksgiving weekend, so it figures to remain a slow period of the Major League Baseball offseason before things, hopefully, start to pick up sometime next week. Still, there's been a notable move along with a few rumors, so let's round everything up. Orioles get their closerThe Orioles were looking for a closer this offseason and they appear to have landed their man. They are in agreement with right-hander Ryan Helsley on a two-year deal for $28 million, per The Athletic. There had been talk that Helsley might convert to a starter for next season, but the report indicates Helsley is now slotted as the closer for the Orioles.\nHelsley, 31, was one of the best closers in baseball in 2024 and was still productive in the role with the Cardinals before being traded to the Mets this past season. In 22 appearances for the Mets, however, he pitched to a 7.20 ERA and 1.80 WHIP. It's entirely possible that was just a small, fluky stretch. In 2024, he had a 2.04 ERA and 1.10 WHIP with 79 strikeouts in 66 ⅓ innings, closing down an MLB-best 49 saves in 53 chances.Phillies expected to retain SchwarberThe \"feeling here is that [Kyle] Schwarber will remain in Philadelphia,\" said MLB.com earlier this week. The report indicates that the Phillies have \"prioritized\" keeping Schwarber and free agent catcher J.T. Realmuto, though nothing as of this writing is close to being done. \nThe 32-year-old DH hit .240/.365/.563 (150 OPS+) with 56 home runs, 132 RBI, 111 runs and 4.7 WAR in 162 games last season. He finished second in NL MVP voting behind Shohei Ohtani. Jays still looking for reliefThe Blue Jays landed free agent starting pitcher Dylan Cease earlier this week and remain in contact with All-Star free agent Bo Bichette. They're also in on relievers, according to SportsNet, looking for at least one late-inning pitcher. The report notes that the Jays were in on Phil Maton before the Cubs signed him and \"monitored\" Raisel Iglesias. \nAs things stand, the defending AL champs have Jeff Hoffman at closer with Yimi García, Louis Varland and Brayden Fisher setting up. \n            ",

The goal was to play as close to perfect as possible in an effort to impress the College Football Playoff selection committee.And anything that happens from there in the bevy of ACC Championship scenarios and two-loss teams ahead of Miami in the current rankings was beyond the Hurricanes' scope. Following a dominant 38-7 showing, Mario Cristobal and the rest of his coaching staff and players will be glued to live scores on the flight home to try and map out positive outcomes that could benefit the Hurricanes later next week when the penultimate playoff rankings are revealed.\"This is a College Football Playoff team,\" Cristobal said after the game Saturday. \"We've all seen it. We know it. Proud of the way our guys came out, dominated from start to finish. We left a lot of points on the board as well. We're really starting to click. Complete dominance. We've got great players in all phases, and we're playing great football in all phases. The best part about football is you get to settle it on the field, where head-to-head is always the No. 1 criterion.\"Miami would play for a conference title only if Virginia Tech beats Virginia and California upsets SMU on Saturday night. That would give the Hurricanes a chance to secure an automatic bid next weekend in Charlotte. The more likely scenario is the wait-and-see frustration that comes with being one of several at-large hopefuls at 10-2 overall.\nWhere Miami is ranked Tuesday night is paramount since there's no additional game to move up in the eyes of the committee. Others could possibly move out -- namely 10th-ranked Alabama if the Crimson Tide beat Auburn then lose to Georgia in the SEC title game, and No. 11 BYU should the Cougars get crushed by Texas Tech in the Big 12 Championship.Without a conference crown, Miami needs to get to No. 10 in the final rankings to reach the playoff and the Hurricanes will be battling for that spot with the Crimson Tide, Cougars and now Texas, whose impressive win over No. 3 Texas A&M on Friday night was a signature victory for the Longhorns.For the first time this season, the committee ranked Miami in the same tier -- or pod -- as No. 9 Notre Dame last week, which is significant given the Hurricanes' last two victories over common opponents that the Fighting Irish also dominated. Notre Dame was still ahead of Miami by a significant margin, despite its head-to-head loss to the Hurricanes in the opener.\nNotre Dame plays at Stanford on Saturday night as a heavy favorite and will likely finish 10-2.Miami's clearest playoff pathA loss Saturday by Alabama, Oklahoma or Notre DameSignificant game control edge over BYU + Texas should final at-large spot come down to thoseA loss by BYU to Texas Tech in the Big 12 Championship GameA loss by Virginia and SMU to get into next week's ACC Championship Game\n            \n    ",

For Ohio State, a dangerous mix of those two resulted in a bizarre identity crisis: a four-game losing streak in \"The Game\" but a 52-1 record against every other Big Ten team.On Saturday, Day ditched the overcorrections and went back to what works. Michigan had no counter.\"I don't think there was any doubt when we walked into the stadium what was going to happen,\" Day declared after the 27-9 victory.\nA year after Ohio State tried to reinvent itself for one opponent and prove a point against Michigan by abandoning a high-flying offense to play bully ball, the coach kept it simple: just be a Buckeye.Julian Sayin threw howitzers through the air, dropping laser-guided bombs for two incredible touchdown catches by super receivers Jeremiah Smith and Carnell Tate. Then the Buckeyes went to the ground, bulldozing Michigan and marching through the snow on a single possession to prove a point: these Buckeyes are not just better, they're bigger and stronger than the Wolverines.A 20-play drive over the course of 11 minutes, 56 seconds in the second half -- easily the longest drive of the season -- in the driving snow was more of a statement than any flag panting at midfield would have been.\n\"We wanted to end the game on our terms,\" Sayin said.\n        \n            \n                Ohio State's Julian Sayin finally got to make his Heisman case in Buckeyes' emphatic win over Michigan\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAnd, no, Ohio State didn't plant its flag or stomp on the block \"M\" at midfield. Day made sure of that, motioning a raucous group of Buckeyes back to the sideline after the game. Day had a lot to say after finally beating his rival for the first time since 2019, but he bit his lip, adding, \"The best thing to do is win with humility.\"Then again, maybe this is just the start of a new routine and winning streak in the sport's fiercest rivalry.\"When you think about where we were at this point last year to all the way now, there's been a lot of great football,\" Day said.\nMaybe it was that 13-10 loss last year inside a bone-chilling Ohio Stadium that awakened Day. Something flipped. Sixteen straight wins. A national title. Now a 12-0 record after losing 14 players to the NFL Draft. This shouldn't make sense, but it does at Ohio State. No team is hotter or better because of Ohio State's reluctance to stray from a self-determined identity. Eleven straight wins by double digits. A defense for a generation. All of that will be challenged next week in the Big Ten Championship Game against undefeated Indiana, a team hammering opponents by an average of 33.4 points, the widest margin in the sport since Florida State won the national title in 2013.For now, Day should live in the moment. He should celebrate. A year ago, fans turned on the coach, booing him out of Ohio State, demanding answers after losing a fourth straight to Michigan and missing the Big Ten Championship. The outside noise was so loud, Day's family hired security to guard their home. \nFour years is a lifetime in college football, but a win against a rival can erase many bad memories.\"You can see it in my face the last couple years,\" Day said. \"You feel like you're letting everybody down. That's just not a good feeling. You work like hell to make sure that you do everything you can to get your guys prepared. That's all you can do. That's exactly what happened here.\"Ohio State's offense may get the praise, but its defense has proven to be one of the best of the last 50 years. No opponent has scored 17 points in this 12-game season, a first in the sport since 1975 (Florida). \nThe offense will get headlines, but the defense has been the anchor of the entire season. No opponent reached 17 points through 12 games -- something no FBS team has done since 1975 Florida. Michigan came nowhere close. Outside of an opening burst and Sayin's lone mistake, the Wolverines were swallowed whole: 39 total yards in the second half, minus-8 rushing after racking up 108 before halftime.\n        \n            \n                2025 Big Ten Championship Game: Ohio State vs. Indiana set for monumental clash in Indianapolis\n                \n                    Tom Fornelli                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"We knew whatever they brought to us we were going to stop,\" defensive end Caden Curry said.Ohio State outgained Michigan 419-163 and took its rival's will somewhere deep under the snow.\nEarly in the fourth quarter, as the Buckeyes churned through their marathon drive, linebacker Sonny Styles glanced at teammate Payton Pierce and soaked in the moment. The snow, the stakes, the rivalry.\"I'm playing in 'The Game' right now,\" Styles said. Both teams trying to get to the Big Ten Championship. It's snowing. It's the end of November. It's the stuff you dream about.\"The domination all season may seem like a dream, but this is Ohio State. The Buckeyes are fully comfortable in their skin, fully aware of their power. \n\"We definitely got way more on the table and we just have so much more to prove,\" Curry said. \"This team has such a great story that needs to be told.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Lionel Messi and Inter Miami are one win away from the first MLS Cup appearance in their history, and at 38, the Argentine shows no signs of slowing down. The Herons will host New York City FC in the Eastern Conference final at Chase Stadium on Saturday as they look to secure a trophy to end their season on a strong note. Adjustments by Javier Mascherano have the team riding a shutout streak of more than 200 minutes, but during these playoffs, one thing has been made clear: Miami will go as far as Messi can take them. This is obviously no surprise. Even at his age, Messi was far and away the best player in MLS this season. He led the league in goals, with 29, five more than anybody else, assists with 19 (tied with Anders Dreyer), and shots with 157. Of those goals, 28 were non-penalty goals an MLS record. He did this all while only playing in only 28 games in a 34 game regular season schedule. Messi may be 38 years old, but he remains Lionel Messi, an unstoppable force the likes of which the world, let alone MLS, has never seen.And then the playoffs started, and things got even better. How to watch Inter Miami vs. New York City FC, oddsDate: Saturday, Nov. 29 | Time: 6 p.m. ETLocation: Chase Stadium -- Fort Lauderdale, FloridaLive stream: MLS Season PassOdds: Inter Miami -210; Draw +360; NYCFC +490With 12 goal contributions during the playoffs, no player has more in MLS history, and Messi's six goals lead all members of the playoffs, and so do his six assists (including secondary assists). He's done this in just four games, but it's unheard of for one player to have been involved in every goal for their club during a playoff run. But that's just what Messi has done during his time in MLS. He has made the unheard of seem regular, and this run is no different.No team has ever won MLS Cup with one player contributing to all of their goals, so if Miami can accomplish that with Messi keeping up what he has been doing, they can make even more history during this postseason. Taylor Twellman, himself an MLS legend, contributed to every goal on the run New England Revolution made the final in 2007, but they fell to the Houston Dynamo in the MLS Cup. Also, that was a grand total of three team goals, Miami is already at 12.\nPlayers to be involved in every goal contributionMinimum four games playedSeasonPlayer TeamGoalsAssistsContributionsTeam Goals Games2025Lionel MessiInter Miami66121242018Daniel RoyerNew York Red Bulls224442007Taylor TwellmanNew England Revolution30334You can already see clear differences in how many goals Messi has been involved in compared to others on this list, and while the league MVP hasn't been announced yet, it'd be a surprise for anyone other than Messi to win the award, as he's arguably having the best season of anyone to ever come through MLS.Messi may not have a trophy to mark what he's done yet, but with Miami becoming the first MLS team to ever defeat a team from a European top-five league when they triumphed over Porto during the Club World Cup, this is a team showing what the possibilities are for MLS, and a large reason for that is Messi's impact so let's take a deeper look at some numbers that have defined the season so far.48: Goal Contributions during the MLS regular seasonWith 29 goals and 19 assists during the season, only one player has had more, and that's Carlos Vela in 2019. Vela had a whopping 49 goal contributions with 34 goals and 15 assists, being involved in more than a goal per game. Those two stand alone, and even with the league including secondary assists in their numbers, this is an astounding figure. It's worth nothing that excluding secondary assists Messi jumps ahead of Vela on the goal contribution front as 16 of Messi's 19 assists were primary assists while only 10 of Vela's 15 were. Then there's the question of penalties. Vela scored a whopping nine goals from the penalty spot, Messi scored one.\nNo one has been able to stop Messi when he's on the pitch, and even when he has to pick his spots to get forward, the Argentine's ability to float into space is unmatched. Having a player like this on the team also opens up opportunities for those around them, which should bring no surprise that Miami's 12 goal contributions during this playoff run are the most of any team.7: Consecutive matches with a goal or an assistTo have so many goal involvements, a player needs to be consistent, and of course, Messi has done just that. You ahve to go back to September 30, facing the Chicago Fire, to find he last time that Messi hasn't been involved in a goal. Since then, he has had 11 goals and 11 assists. Quite some balance, but in the 32 MLS matches that Messi has featured in this season, including the playoffs, he has only failed to register a goal contribution in five matches. Miami has also failed to win any of those matches, losing four and drawing one. So it's simple: if NYCFC stops Messi, they can win the match. Just statistics say that it'll be quite hard to do.0: Trophies this seasonWhile the Messi era has brought Miami a Supporters' Shield and Leagues Cup trophy, this is one number that the Herons are trying to change, and New York City FC will stand in their way of doing that. NYCFC is the only team remaining in the playoffs that have won the MLS Cup before, but that doesn't mean Miami won't have enough experience to get them through the match in front of their home fans. Looking to not only send Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets into retirement on a high note but also close out Chase Stadium with a trophy, all of the pressure will be on the Herons to get the job done. \nThat's part of why the playoffs have had a different intensity for them. Last season's first round exit to Atlanta United is firmly in the past, but this season also isn't a successful one without a trophy. Just having Messi in the side raises expectations for Inter Miami above what has ever been expected from any MLS side, and they can reach those but not winning MLS Cup will only bring more questions to the side.\n            ",

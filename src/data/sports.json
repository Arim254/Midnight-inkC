    "body": "\n        The 2026 Farmers Insurance Open tees off on Thursday from Torrey Pines Golf Course in San Diego, Calif., for the third PGA Tour event of the 2026 season. The Farmers Insurance Open features a viable field, including Brooks Koepka making his high-profile PGA Tour return. Xander Schauffele is the +1400 favorite in the latest 2026 Farmers Insurance Open odds, followed by Ludvig Aberg (+1700) and Cameron Young (+1900). Koepka has +5000 odds to win. Many golf bettors will choose to play  PGA Tour prop bets when placing 2026 Farmers Insurance Open bets, and the SportsLine model has found some Farmers Insurance Open prop bets it projects value in, including backing J.J. Spaun to finish in the top 5, which has +550 odds (risk $100 to win $550). The model also likes Jason Day to defeat Keegan Bradley in a tournament matchup at -140 odds. It also finds value in Si Woo Kim, who finished T6 last week, to finish in the top 10 at +290 odds. Before locking in any 2026 Farmers Insurance Open prop picks or other PGA Tour bets on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up over $8,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.This same model has also nailed a whopping 16 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- as well as this year's PGA Championship and Open Championship. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting sites. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Top 2026 Farmers Insurance Open prop picksJ.J. Spaun to finish top 5 (+550)Si Woo Kim to finish top 10 (+290)Jason Day (-140) over Keegan Bradley in a tournament matchupJ.J. Spaun to finish in the top 5 (+550)Spaun was a longshot winner of last year's U.S. Open for his second career PGA Tour victory, and that played a key part in his best FedEx Cup finish on the Tour, placing T25 after barely cracking the top 100 and finishing 98th the year before. Spaun made 21 of 25 cuts last year after making just 16 of 28 the year before. In his season debut this year, Spaun closed the Sony Open with a 4-under 66 on the final round, and the model thinks he can carry that momentum into this weekend. The 35-year-old finished T15 at last year's Farmers Insurance Open. He ranked seventh on the PGA Tour in total strokes gained last year, and the model projects value in him at +550 odds to crack the top 5 this weekend. Click here to bet on Spaun at FanDuel, where new users receieve $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins. Si Woo Kim to finish top 10 (+290)Kim is a four-time PGA Tour winner, and the 30-year-old had three top-10 finishes last year. He missed the cut at last year's Farmers Insurance Open, but he's made it in six of eight career appearances. Kim finished T6 at last week's American Express and just missed the top 10 in the tournament before, finishing T11 at the Sony Open. He's off to a fast start, ranking sixth on the PGA Tour in scoring average, fifth in driving accuracy and ninth in both strokes gained: Off the Tee and strokes gained: Approach to Green. Given his hot start and experience at the Farmers Insurance Open, the model sees value at him at nearly 3-1 odds to finish in the top 10 this weekend. Click here to bet on Kim at FanDuel, where new users receieve $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins. Jason Day (-140) over Keegan BradleyThis is the first tournament the two will compete in together this year, but their starts to the 2026 PGA Tour season have been significantly different. Bradley missed the cut at the Sony Open, while Day finished T2 at last week's American Express. Day closed with an 8-under 64 on Sunday to finish with the best score for anyone not named Scottie Scheffler, which often seems to be the best you can ask for when golfing against the world's No. 1. Two of Day's 13 career PGA Tour wins have come at the Farmers Insurance Open, and he has seven top-10 finishes over his last 13 appearances in this tournament. Meanwhile, Bradley, the most recent USA Ryder Cup captain, has just one top-10 finish over his last six Farmers Insurance Opens. The model expects Day to fight for a top-five spot, while Bradley doesn't crack its top 10. Caesars Sportsbook offers this Farmers Insurance Open prop bet, and you can click here to bet on Day at Caesars Sportsbook, where new users receive a first bet match up to $250 bonus bet win or lose with the promo code CBSSPORTS250BM.Want more picks for the 2026 Farmers Insurance Open?You've seen the SportsLine model's 2026 Farmers Insurance Open props for this weekend.

Purdue has been on a run with the Over as of late as Boilermakers' games have eclipsed the total at a 6-2 clip over the last eight. A big reason for that is Purdue's highly efficient offense, which ranks second in KenPom's offensive rating as Matt Painter's crew is eighth in the nation in field goal percentage.As for the Hoosiers, their offense is ahead of their defense as they are 28th, nationally, in offensive efficiency compared to 57th on the defensive end. Indiana is projected to have the leading scorer in this contest, with Lamar Wilkerson surpassing 20 points, as he's one of eight total players forecasted to reach double-digits. That allows the Over to hit with points to spare with the model calling for 158 combined points. Thus, the Over hits 65.3% of the time.The model also says one side of the spread hits nearly 60% of the time. You can only see that pick at SportsLine.So who wins Indiana vs. Purdue, and which side of the spread hits nearly 60% of the time? Visit SportsLine now to see which side of the Purdue vs. Indiana spread to back, all from the advanced model that has simulated this game 10,000 times, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NBA slate is filled with contests featuring massive point spreads, so those looking for some of the most competitive action on the hardwood may want to seek out college basketball options when exploring the current DraftKings promo code, which gives new users $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins. The Tuesday college basketball schedule features a top-five matchup with No. 3 Michigan (18-1) hosting No. 5 Nebraska (20-0), and one of SportsLine's top experts has locked in a pick on this contest. The SportsLine Projection Model also has one of its top picks coming from a ranked college basketball matchup, backing unranked Oklahoma to defeat No. 15 Arkansas at home as +130 underdogs in one of its Tuesday best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook. The Razorbacks are favored by 2.5 points on the road at Oklahoma. The model has also locked in an NBA best bet, backing the Milwaukee Bucks as 10.5-point underdogs against the Philadelphia 76ers, despite this being their first game since Giannis Antetokounmpo's calf injury from Friday. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every NBA game 10,000 times and has returned well over $10,000 in betting profit for $100 players on its top-rated NBA picks over the past eight-plus seasons. The model enters Week 15 of the 2025-26 NBA season on a sizzling 37-16 roll on top-rated NBA spread picks dating back to last season. Anyone following its NBA betting advice at sportsbooks and on betting apps could have seen huge returns.Tuesday best bets at DraftKings SportsbookBucks (+10.5) vs. 76ers (-110)Michigan (-10.5) vs. Nebraska (-105)Oklahoma (+130) to defeat ArkansasCombining the three picks into a Tuesday parlay at DraftKings would result in a payout of +734 (risk $100 to win $676). Bet it at DraftKings here: (Odds subject to change)\nBucks (+10.5) vs. 76ers (-110)The Bucks are well rested to begin their next run without Giannis Antetokounmpo, who suffered a multi-week calf injury on Friday. They were supposed to play Sunday, but that game was postponed due to travel issues from the winter storm, giving the Bucks more time to rest and also strengthen their on-court chemistry in preperation of playing without Antetokounmpo. The 31-year-old superstar also missed three weeks in December with a calf injury, and the Bucks went 4-4 against the spread during that time. They only lost two games by more than 10 points, though. While the Bucks are rested, the 76ers are playing the second half of a back-to-back following a 130-93 loss to the Hornets. Neither Joel Embiid (knee) nor Paul George (knee) played Monday, so they could suit up for the second half of the back-to-back, but still, the model views 10.5 points as too drastic a number. The 76ers are home, but they are 12-13 overall and 11-14 ATS at home this season. Bet the Bucks to cover at DraftKings here:Michigan (-10.5) vs. Nebraska (-105)\"Nebraska's non-conference SOS ranks #299, showing their strong record is built on weak opponents,\" SportsLine expert Jeff Hochman said.\"They're unbeaten in Big Ten play but benefited from close wins and a high \"Luck\" rating (#33 KenPom). Michigan, with a non-conference SOS of 14th, is No. 2 in KenPom and boasts an Adjusted Efficiency Margin (+35.87) nearly 8 points higher than Nebraska. Such a gap signals a major mismatch. It's the equivalent of a Final 4 team against a Sweet 16 squad. Michigan's top-ranked 2-point offense and defense, while playing the 7th hardest schedule, make them a powerhouse. Nebraska is a poor offensive rebounding team (17th Big Ten, 304th nationally), limiting second-chance points. On the road against Michigan's physicality and the Crisler Center crowd, Nebraska faces a \"market correction\" blowout. Bet Michigan to cover at DraftKings here:Oklahoma (+130) to defeat ArkansasThe model doesn't believe the Sooners are as bad as their 1-6 SEC record indicates, with all six of their losses coming either on the road or against a ranked team. Oklahoma faces another ranked team in its building on Tuesday, but the Sooners nearly defeated No. 18 Alabama in an 83-81 home loss on Jan. 17, and they are coming off a buzzer-beater road loss to Missouri on Saturday. They are a few bounces away from winning two of three entering this contest. Akransas is 5-2 in SEC play this season, but the Sooners defeated the Razorbacks in Arkansas last season. Oklahoma has won three of its last four games against Arkansas. The model projects the Sooners to win in 57% of simulations, showcasing solid value at plus-money odds. Bet Oklahoma to win at DraftKings here:\nWant more NBA, college basketball picks for Tuesday?You've seen some of the model's Tuesday best bets.

Michigan erased a seven-point hole with eight minutes left in regulation to improve to 19-1 and, at 9-1 in the Big Ten, join Michigan State and the Cornhuskers atop the conference standings.The Huskers (20-1, 9-1) lost their perfect record, but won plenty of respect, showing championship-level mettle in their toughest test of the season without star big man Rienk Mast (illness) and stud sixth man Braden Frager (ankle injury). Even with two of its best four players sidelined, Nebraska gave Michigan all it could handle and then some with a barrage of treys in the first half. The Huskers dropped 50 on Michigan's vaunted defense in the first 20 minutes alone, but they ran out of gas down the stretch. Nebraska didn't score a single point for the final 3:21 of the gameBoth Michigan and Nebraska came into the game as projected No. 1 seeds in the CBS Sports Bracketology model and are both expected to remain on the top line after their only regular-season meeting when the NCAA Tournament bracket projection updates Wednesday.After Nebraska's loss, No. 24 Miami defeated UMass 86-84 and matched No. 1 Arizona's 21-0 mark this season. The Wildcats held on to defeat No. 13 BYU 86-83 on Monday. \n\n        \n            \n                Arizona is 21-0. The scary part? It can still get better\n                \n                    Matt Norlander                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHome losses are killers for Big Ten Championship hopes, and Michigan was on life support until it got a spark from some unlikely sources. Senior forward Will Tschetter changed the tenor of the game with his attention to detail defensively and constant energy. Tschetter finished with seven points, didn't miss a shot and Michigan outscored Nebraska by eight points in his 15 minutes of playing time. Freshman Trey McKenney hopped off the bench and was terrific, pouring in 11 points, including a go-ahead, big-boy bucket in the final minute.Without key contributions from McKenney and Tschetter, Nebraska very well could have notched one of the most impressive road wins of the season. \nUltimately, Michigan used its patented brawn to finally put the Huskers away for good. Michigan had six enormous offensive rebounds in the second half to stem the tide and stay alive. Morez Johnson Jr. erupted for 17 points and 12 rebounds. His frontcourt mate, Aday Mara, chipped in 10 points and seven boards. \nPryce Sandfort was outstanding for the Huskers, yet again, chipping in 20 points. Jamarques Lawrence hit some big-time treys in the first half on his way to 20 points. Former walk-on Sam Hoiberg (13 points, seven rebounds, five assists and four steals) continued his stellar breakout season.\n            ",

This was Belichick's first year of eligibility since he has not coached in the NFL since 2023. According to ESPN, several associates close to Belichick told the outlet that he was \"puzzled\" and \"disappointed\" by the lack of support from the Pro Football Hall of Fame's committee members. Belichick, who is entering his second year in college football as the coach at North Carolina, is the NFL's most successful coach in the Super Bowl era. He has won eight total Super Bowls: two as an assistant as six as a head coach with the Patriots, the latter of which is an NFL record. His 12 Super Bowl appearances are also an NFL record. He is second all-time among NFL coaches with 333 career wins, trailing only two-time Super Bowl winner and Hall of Famer Don Shula at 347. Belichick's 31 playoff wins are more than any coach in NFL history. As are his 17 divisional championships as a head coach. Under Belichick's guidance, New England won the AFC East each year from 2009-19. \n\n        \n            \n                Bill Belichick's snub demands a Hall of Fame reckoning\n                \n                    Jonathan Jones                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe sticking point with Belichick, according to ESPN, are the multiple scandals that he was embroiled in during his time with the Patriots. In 2007, Belichick was fined $500,000 -- the largest fine ever levied against an NFL coach to that point -- for his involvement in the Spygate scandal. The Patriots also lost a first-round pick in the 2008 NFL Draft. \"The only explanation [for the outcome] was the cheating stuff,\" a Hall of Fame voter told ESPN. \"It really bothered some of the guys.\"\nThe same logic was applied to New England owner Robert Kraft when he was passed over again for induction in 2025. Kraft is a finalist for the 2026 Hall of Fame class for the first time after gaining eligibility 14 years ago. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Houston Astros stars Jose Altuve and Carlos Correa will not play in this year's World Baseball Classic because they were unable to get insurance on their contracts, reports The Athletic. Without insurance, the two players would risk forfeiting their salaries for any regular-season games missed as a result of an injury suffered during the tournament.\"I'm definitely upset because I've been preparing really hard this  offseason to get better this year and be ready early so I can be ready  for the WBC,\" Correa told The Athletic. \"I also understand the business side of things and that's too big of a risk to take, to play with no insurance.\"Correa is owed $31.5 million in 2026, $10 million of which will be paid by the Minnesota Twins as a condition of last summer's trade that sent him back to Houston. Altuve has a $30 million salary this coming season. He missed the first 43 games of the 2023 season after getting hit by a pitch during the WBC and suffering a fractured thumb. The injury required surgery.All 40-man roster players are evaluated by an independent insurer (agreed upon by MLB and the MLBPA) that determines whether the player's contract is insurable based on his injury history. If the player can't be insured, he can still participate in the WBC, though he would risk forfeiting salary during any time lost to injury.Future Hall of Famers Miguel Cabrera and Clayton Kershaw withdrew from the 2023 WBC because they were unable to secure insurance.\nAn oblique strain and multiple bouts of plantar fasciitis have limited Correa to 365 of 486 regular-season games since 2022, including only 86 games in 2024. Altuve has played at least 153 games each of the last two seasons, though he had minor surgery to remove fluid from his right foot in November. He is expected to be ready for spring training.Teams can only block players from the WBC if they spend a certain number of days on the injured list in the most recent season. Neither Altuve nor Correa meet that criteria, but without insurance, they risk forfeiting salary. Astros owner Jim Crane reached out to both players about the insurance issue and implored them to skip the event.\"Jim called me and told me that he wants me to focus on the team and  spring training,\" Correa told The Athletic. \"Obviously he traded for me to win a championship here  and we had too many injuries as a team (in 2025).\"\nCorrea, 31, played for Puerto Rico in the 2017 WBC. He skipped the 2023 WBC because his wife was expecting their second child. Altuve, 35, played for Venezuela in the 2017 and 2023 WBCs.\n            ",

This is Saleh's second coaching opportunity after he spent three-plus years with New York Jets from 2021-24. Like Saleh, Daboll is a former coach who was fired during his fourth season on the job. Daboll served as the New York Giants' coach for three-plus years before he was relieved of his duties this season when New York got off to a 2-8 start. The Giants have since replaced Daboll with John Harbaugh, who was fired by the Baltimore Ravens shortly after the 2025 regular season concluded.\nWhile it didn't end on a great note, Daboll's time in the Big Apple did include leading the Giants to the franchise's first playoff win since defeating the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLVI. The Giants were unable to match that success during Daboll's final three seasons, however, which led to his firing. It's worth noting that Daboll's time in New York also included several personnel decisions by general manager Joe Schoen that didn't age well, most notably his decision to pay Daniel Jones over Saquon Barkley, then releasing Jones less than two years later. \nPrior to coming to New York, Daboll enjoyed a successful four-year run as the Bills' offensive coordinator while working with quarterback Josh Allen. His NFL coaching background also includes offensive coordinator stints with the Cleveland Browns, Miami Dolphins and Kansas City Chiefs. Daboll also won five Super Bowls as a member of the New England Patriots' coaching staff.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Nearly eight months into his recovery from a torn Achilles, Indiana Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton continues to progress toward an eventual return to the court, although that will not come until the 2026-27 season. Haliburton has progressed to playing full-court 4-on-4 games against team interns and some of the Pacers' reserves but said on the \"Mind the Game\" podcast with LeBron James that he still has \"some time\" before he will be back to his old self.The new version of Haliburton that takes the floor next season may also be a bit larger and take on a more physical play style. Indiana's point guard said he is up 30 pounds since the last game of the 2025 season and that if he maintains some of that new weight, he can use size to his advantage when he returns.\"That's really something that I'm trying to focus on through my rehab, through my time to get back is just being more physical,\" Haliburton said. \"I was 180 pounds on Game 7 day. I'm 210 right now. I'm up 30 pounds, bro. And obviously when I start to run, I'm gonna get that off me. Some of it's not good because I've been drowning my sorrows in cookies and ice cream and stuff. But I think I see that and it's a way for me to be more physical at the rim, to get more free throws.\"Getting into chests, tangling arms, making all these perfect reads to get to the free throw line is just something I'm really trying to focus on adding through rehab as I watch the game.\"\nTime away from the court also allows Haliburton to watch games through a different lens. Rather than taking in game film from a scouting perspective, the 25-year-old Iowa State product has spent time putting himself in other players' shoes and learning about tendencies and skills that he can adopt when he is back at full strength.In fact, Haliburton pointed to Boston Celtics guard Payton Pritchard as a player who boasts the kind of physical game he wishes to emulate.\"I think seeing the game of basketball, I'm watching it in a different light,\" Haliburton said. \"I think it's different when you're getting ready to play a team like Boston, for example, and we've got Payton Pritchard. He's nice. All I'm focused on is can I get a stop. I'm not thinking about how he's making his reads and stuff.\"\nPlaying bigger and stronger after his extended layoff could help Haliburton take his game to the next level. He is already a versatile defender and talented scorer but stands to benefit from putting good weight onto his frame.If Haliburton becomes the latest player to fully overcome what is so often a devastating injury, the best days of his career as a burgeoning superstar could still lie ahead. But the NBA is still months away from learning whether that will be the case for the two-time All-Star and 2024 assists leader.\"The biggest thing is I really am glad for where I am,\" Haliburton said. \"I'm thankful for it. The process has sucked, man. There's been good days, bad days. There's been days where I sit there and I keep asking, 'Why is this happening to me?' It's hard for me to understand in this moment, but I understand that it's allowing me to grow in different ways, to grow in my faith, to grow in all these different ways that have been good for me.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NFL world was shocked when news broke on Tuesday that former New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick did not receive the required vote to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on his first attempt. CBS Sports Jonathan Jones confirmed the news that the current North Carolina football coach did not receive the 40 out of 50 votes needed to reach the Hall of Fame in his first year on the ballot.This was Belichick's first year of eligibility since he had not coached in the NFL since 2023.Belichick, who won eight total Super Bowls (two as an assistant with the Giants, six as a head coach with the Patriots), is second all-time among NFL coaches with 333 career wins. That number only trails two-time Super Bowl winner and Hall of Famer Don Shula, who has 347 career wins.\n        \n            \n                Legendary former Patriots coach Bill Belichick falls short of Pro Football Hall of Fame on first ballot\n                \n                    Will Backus                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nKansas City Chiefs star quarterback Patrick Mahomes was among the names who spoke out after the repot. Mahomes posted on social that the decision was \"insane\" and that he doesn't understand \"how this could be possible.\" Notably, Mahomes and the Chiefs faced the Patriots in the 2019 AFC Championship Game. New England went on to win that game in overtime, paving the way for Belichick to win his sixth title as a head coach weeks later.\nEven NBA superstar LeBron James was confused by the report, saying that it was \"disrespectful.\"\nFormer NFL defensive back Darius Butler, who played for Belichick during the 2009 and 2010 campaigns, also spoke out, citing that if he isn't a first-ballot Hall of Famer, then \"who is?\"\nFormer NFL star JJ Watt, who will be a future Hall of Famer one day, said there shouldn't be a \"single world\" that Belichick is not a \"First-Ballot Hall of Famer.\"\nFormer NFL defensive back Ryan Clark posted on social media that if Belichick isn't a first-ballot Hall of Famer, \"no coach should be.\"\nFormer NFL defensive tackle Gerald McCoy said the voters need to be made public after the former Patriots coach did not receive 40 of the 50 votes needed.\nFormer NFL quarterback Robert Griffin III said that Belichick \"earned\" the right to be a first ballot Hall of Famer. \nOne of the members of the Hall's voting committee is former NFL general manager Bill Polian. A voter, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ESPN that Polian told some voters he believed Belichick should \"wait a year\" before induction because of Spygate. The 2007 cheating scandal cost the Patriots a first-round pick and Belichick was fined $250,000. Former NFL star Terrell Owens appeared to react to the report on social media shortly after.\nFormer NFL star wide receiver Dez Bryant said he was \"lost for words.\"\nNew Orleans Saints star Cameron Jordan posted on social media that he is normally surprised when people get in the Hall of Fame, not the other way around.\nMore former Patriots players, including Julian Edelman and Jason McCourty, also reacted to the stunning news.\n            ",

    "body": "\nWednesday's action will feature some of the most exciting matchups of the season as Antonio Conte's Napoli will host Chelsea at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona. While the team now managed by Liam Rosenior are still fighting for a spot in the top eight, the Serie A champions are seriously at risk of being eliminated from the European tournament after a disappointing campaign. The Azzurri won two games, drew two and lost three matches in the opening seven matches of the league phase, including a disappointing 6-2 defeat against PSV. Napoli's chances to qualify are still up to them, as Conte's team will need to win against Chelsea, while a draw might not be enough and they will have to wait and hope for other results. Here's what you need to know ahead of the match against Chelsea that will take place on Wednesday:  Viewing information Date: Wednesday, Jan. 28 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Stadio Diego Armando Maradona -- NaplesLive stream: Paramount+Odds: Napoli +209; Draw +250; Chelsea +124How can Napoli qualify? Napoli still have a chance to qualify for the playoffs of the 2025-26 Champions League but need to win against Chelsea to make that happens. Napoli have a minus-five goal difference entering the last match of the league phase which is not ideal considering the rivals and only a win over Chelsea can guarantee them playing in the next phase. In case of a draw or a defeat and if teams are level on points following the end of the league phase, this is how tiebreakers will be applied:Overall goal differenceGoals scored in all league matchesAway goals scored in all league matchesTotal winsAway winsStrength of schedule, includes points, goal difference and goals scored of all opponents faced in league phaseFewer disciplinary points, one point for a yellow card, three points for a red card, and three points for two yellow cardsHigher overall ranking in the UEFA Club CoefficientWill Conte leave Napoli if they fail? Napoli are not facing their best moment as Conte's team is deeply affected by injuries and saw some changes in the roster during the current winter transfer window. Summer signings Lorenzo Lucca and Noa Lang left the roster after a disappointing start of the season and Napoli signed Giovane from Hellas Verona this winter, showing the disappointment of the Italian manager on the summer moves. With many injuries affecting the roster, such as key players David Neres, Vanja Milinkovic-Savic, Matteo Politano and Kevin de Bruyne, who will all miss Chelsea's game, Conte is facing a difficult moment after losing 3-0 over the weekend against Juventus away. In case of a Champions League elimination, the future of Conte won't be in doubt but many things can change from today to the end of the season when the Italian coach will decide again on his future and the current performances might affect his decisions in the coming months, as he has already showed during his career.  Possible lineups Napoli XI: Vanja Milinkovic-Savic; Giovanni Di Lorenzo, Alessandro Buongiorno, Juan Jesus, Miguel Gutierrez; Stanislav Lobotka, Scott McTominay, Leonardo Spinazzola, Antonio Vergara; Eljif Elmas, Rasmus Hoejlund.Chelsea XI: Filip Joergensen; Malo Gusto, Wesley Fofana, Benoit Badiashile, Jorrel Hato; Reece James, Moises Caicedo; Pedro Neto, Enzo Fernandez, Alejandro Garnacho; Liam Delap. Prediction It will be a challenging one for Napoli but they need to win in order to avoid a likely elimination from the tournament. Pick: Napoli 2, Chelsea 2.  How to watch All of the action on Matchday 8 of the UEFA Champions League can be caught on Paramount+, while CBS Sports Network and CBS Sports Golazo Network will have select simultaneous coverage.

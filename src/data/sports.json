    "body": "\n        It's fair to say that Week 12 of the 2025 college football season is shaping up to be one of the most important slates yet. There's a lot on the line as multiple teams jockey for spots in the 12-team College Football Playoff and, now that rankings are released weekly, we have an even better idea of how the landscape looks. With that in mind, there are several prominent programs facing make-or-break games this weekend. For instance, neither No. 9 Notre Dame nor No. 22 Pittsburgh could brunt another loss and still keep their playoff hopes intact -- especially not Notre Dame, which does not have the benefit of a conference championship at the end of the year. So it's fascinating that Notre Dame and Pittsburgh must face one another Saturday. No. 10 Texas and No. 11 Oklahoma don't play each other, but they do have to contend with ranked conference foes and, with two losses already, their respective seasons are likely on the line. It's a lot of action for one weekend of college football and the CFP Rankings will almost assuredly look entirely different next Tuesday. \nWe here at CBS Sports have been overreacting to each college football weekend for a while now. Let's try and manifest some into existence for a change ahead of the 12th week of the season. Lane Kiffin shouldn't go anywhere \nNo. 7 Ole Miss continues its push for a playoff appearance Saturday as it hosts a Florida team searching for a new coach after the midseason firing of Billy Napier. Ironically, Kiffin's name has received plenty of buzz in connection with Florida's vacancy. Kiffin has also been linked to LSU and there's been a prevailing thought -- for quite some time -- that he would jump at the chance to fill a high-level opening. This is not the year to do that. \nKiffin's Rebels should dispatch the Gators handily. In that, hopefully Kiffin realizes how good he has it at Ole Miss. He could do no wrong in Oxford. He has steadily built Ole Miss into a legitimate national competitor while teams like Florida have been mired in decades of mediocrity. Why would he leave one rebuild for another? LSU is a little more stable -- on paper, at least -- but there have been plenty of red flags cropping up in the early days of its coaching search, including interference from the state's governor and the \"will they, won't they\" nature of Verge Ausberry's promotion to athletic director. Going to either Florida or LSU would also increase the level of expectations that Kiffin faces. LSU just fired a coach that produced multiple double-digit win seasons because he was unable to win a title. Kiffin could cruise at Ole Miss with consistent nine or 10-win campaigns. \nIt just seems like an unnecessary risk when he already has it made with the Rebels. Pittsburgh is championship quality \nPittsburgh has flown under the radar all season even though it has landed inside the top 25 of each of the first two College Football Playoff rankings. The Panthers have quietly won five games in a row to emerge as a real contender for the ACC Championship Game and beyond. Saturday will serve as their coming out party. It's an ideal chance to make some noise, as they welcome No. 9 Notre Dame to Acrisure Stadium in a colossal matchup between two programs that really need the win. \nThe nation will recognize Pitt's legitimacy after it takes down the Fighting Irish. This will be Notre Dame's second road test since the start of October. The only other away game the Irish played in that span was at one-win Boston College. Outside of that, Notre Dame has lost its only road contest against a ranked opponent, though that came all the way back on Aug. 31 at Miami. Pittsburgh will be able to limit Notre Dame's explosive rushing attack with a defense that is tops in the ACC against the run. If the Panthers can put the onus on Notre Dame quarterback CJ Carr -- especially in what should be a hostile environment -- they can pull out the stunner. \nThe CFP's Group of Six team will come from outside the American\nConventional wisdom this season has regarded the eventual winner of the American Conference as the Group of Six's most likely College Football Playoff representative. After all, the American is filled to the brim with seven and eight-win teams, some of which -- like South Florida -- have marquee wins over Power Four programs on their résumés. Memphis was the highest-ranked (outside the top 25) Group of Six program in the initial College Football Playoff rankings and South Florida followed suit on Nov. 11. Navy, Tulane and North Texas are all still in the hunt, as well. The problem with the American is that it continues to cannibalize itself. Navy lost to North Texas. North Texas lost to South Florida. South Florida lost to Memphis. Memphis -- somehow -- lost to UAB and dropped a pivotal game against Tulane. Tulane suffered a bad setback against UTSA. \nIt's a mess, and it's going to get messier Saturday when South Florida drops its road game to Navy. That will allow a program outside of the American Conference, like James Madison, to enter pole position. James Madison remains unblemished in conference play and its lone loss on the year came by 14 points against Louisville, a potential ACC champion, on the road. If the Dukes can finish undefeated and win the Sun Belt, they should have a compelling case against whatever champion emerges from the beat-up American.    Jerry Mack will be a top coaching candidate one day \nIf you're not familiar with Jerry Mack, it's time to learn his name. The former assistant coach at Tennessee and with the Jacksonville Jaguars in the NFL got his first crack at being an FBS head coach at Kennesaw State. \nIn just his first year in that capacity, and in Kennesaw State's second season as an FBS program, he has the Owls looking like a favorite to win Conference USA. This just one year removed from a 2-10 campaign, as well. Kennesaw State is 5-0 in league play this year and, on Saturday, Mack's squad will take a commanding lead in the standings when it downs fellow undefeated C-USA opponent Jacksonville State. Mack may not be a hot coaching name this cycle, but he will be down the road if he sustains the success. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        We can remember the days when midseason coaching changes would happen far more often in pro football (like Brian Daboll walking the plank with the Giants this week) than in the college ranks. For decades, it was rare to see a midseason college change. Now, midseason removals have become so customary, especially this season, that it was a surprise after last weekend that no coach was immediately pink-slipped.No matter, as we have an inordinate amount of in-season coaching movement, it's probably a good idea to check the progress (or lack thereof), especially against the spread, for the interim coaches. With a few big weeks still to go in the regular season, finding just a couple of \"The Interims\" making a difference, one way or another, could prove very beneficial to gridiron handicappers.The following is a rundown of the interim coaches and how they have been faring, particularly against the spread, in their temporary roles. Bet college football at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass with a winning $5 wager:Bobby Petrino, Arkansas Petrino, a former Arkansas HC with other head coaching stops, was an obvious choice to move up from his OC job when Sam Pittman walked the plank in late September after the Razorbacks were crushed by Notre Dame. Though four games at the helm, Petrino still hasn't won outright after managing two scrappy spread covers at Tennessee and hosting Texas A&M. SEC sources say there is a faction of the booster base that would like to see Petrino return, though that doesn't seem to be likely. With the team in the midst of a seven-game skid, Petrino hasn't been able to pull Arkansas out of its lurch, and we wonder if Petrino can extract something from his troops in the final three high-profile games (LSU, Texas, Missouri).  Next game: Saturday at LSUDJ Durkin, Auburn Durkin, a former HC at Maryland, isn't a likely successor to Hugh Freeze on the Plains, but is more likely an audition for a DC job, where he could be one of the highest-paid in the country, for 2026. And with the carousel likely to start spinning very soon, there should be no shortage of HC opportunities throughout the FBS ranks. Durkin has had one game in charge, a rather startling 45-38 OT loss at Vanderbilt (depending upon when one placed a wager, that spread result could have been win, lose or draw for Auburn) as the Tigers' offense, now behind Stanford transfer QB Ashton Daniels, looked better than it has all season.  Next games: Nov. 22 vs. Mercer, Iron Bowl vs. Alabama at Jordan-Hare on Nov. 29 Tyson Summers, Colorado StateThis is one interim hire we can safely say isn't inspiring the troops, with it looking rather like simply the last chapter of a season gone very bad in Fort Collins. Summers, promoted from DC, has been at the helm for two games, and CSU looked like it would rather be anywhere else in both. CSU was smoked 28-0 at Wyoming, then allowed over 300 rush yards as UNLV ran wild at Canvas Stadium. Summers, whose previous HC stint at Georgia Southern ended in great disappointment, doesn't look to be changing that narrative with the Rams. The program appears an absolute mess at the moment. Next game: Saturday at New MexicoBilly Gonzales, Florida Gonzales has had two games in charge since being promoted from WR coach, but it looks like all of the eggs were in the Georgia basket at Jacksonville two weeks ago, as the Gators were on the verge of a major upset until the Bulldogs rallied late. It was a handy spread cover there for Gonzales, but not last week at Kentucky, when the roof caved and Gonzalez had to pull mistake-prone QB DJ Lagway in the 38-7 loss.  Florida looked like it didn't want to be there at Lexington last week, and the schedule for the next three weeks is no less treacherous. Next game: Saturday at Ole MissFrank Wilson, LSU Wilson, who has previous HC experience at UTSA, has had just one game in charge of the Tigers, the 20-9 loss at Alabama last week. For most, it was a narrow spread loser at +10.5 points, and the performance looked a lot like most of LSU's other efforts this season. One change from predecessor Brian Kelly, however, was Wilson wasn't afraid to make a QB switch, pulling the ineffective Garrett Nussmeier in the second half at Tuscaloosa and turning the offense to Mississippi State transfer Michael Van Buren.Unlike Florida's effort at Kentucky, the Tigers did battle rather hard for Wilson. This doesn't necessarily look like a \"spread negative\" situation the rest of November.Next game: Saturday vs. ArkansasDoug Meacham, Oklahoma State After the Cowboys program collapsed last season, Mike Gundy's dismissal in Stillwater was more telegraphed than one of George Foreman's roundhouse right aimed at Ali in the Rumble on the Jungle. Losing QB Hauss Hejny in the opener got the QB carousel spinning quickly for OSU and set the tone for a continuation of 2023; it hasn't been pretty, the lone win all season was over FCS UT-Martin in the opener. Meacham, promoted from OC, is winless in six tries, with the best he could do being to squeeze a couple of spread covers as 20+ underdogs vs. Baylor and Kansas  There has been no upgrade in Stillwater since the end of the Gundy regime almost two months ago.  Next game: Saturday vs. Kansas StateRobb Akey, Oregon State By the time the veteran Akey (formerly HC at Idaho) was promoted in mid-October, the Beavers were 0-6 and could have been excused if they simply wanted to forfeit the rest of the campaign. Still, Akey lit a bit of a spark that Trent Bray couldn't, steering OSU wins and covers in his first two games (OK, one was vs. FCS Lafayette, but it still counts as a win; the other was a rousing 10-7 upset over last-remaining Pac-12 rival Washington State).  Keeping the momentum through the remainder of the season already looks a chore as the Beavers blew a double-digit lead last weekend at Corvallis and allowed lowly visitor Sam Houston to collar them at the wire. For the moment, that's enough to keep us off of OSU and leave Beavers fans with memories of the WSU win before the Pac-12 reappears next fall.Next game: Saturday at TulsaTerry Smith, Penn StateThe Nittany Lions still had a full half-season to go when they cut James Franklin loose in early October, and the losing has continued (0-3) for Smith, promoted from an associate HC position. Efforts, however, have been decidedly better for Smith, who, while not yet winning outright, has covered two of three in the teeth of the schedule, and the spread loss at top-ranked Ohio State hardly a demerit. Not to mention Penn State put a real scare into second-ranked Indiana last week at Happy Valley. Smith has been extracting good efforts in his three games, even without QB Drew Allar, down for the count with injury, with freshman Ethan Grunkmeyer holding his own. The early-season go-against angle for Penn State hasn't applied under Smith. Next game: Saturday at Michigan StateFrank Reich, StanfordTechnically, Reich counts as an in interim for this season, even if not in the traditional after-the-season-starts sense, after Troy Taylor was forced out in early spring. Heeding a call from his former Colts QB and new Stanford Football GM Andrew Luck, Reich was open to a role as a stop-gap and at least had several months and a fall camp to operate as the program leader, though he reportedly isn't considering himself a candidate for the full-time job. Expectations were already low on The Farm but in truth, Reich has already exceeded those with three outright wins in Palo Alto. And despite limited weaponry, the Cardinal has continued to battle most weeks, including a late backdoor cover last week at North Carolina. Consensus opinion is Reich is doing better than Taylor the past two seasons and to his credit, Stanford hasn't disintegrated to Oklahoma State-like levels.Next game: November 22 vs. Cal Alex Mortensen, UAB Mortensen, promoted from OC after Trent Dilfer's termination, provided the inspirational moment for all interims everywhere when dumping ranked and unbeaten Memphis at Birmingham in his debut game on Oct. 18. Yet this is beginning to look more and more like a one-off under Mortensen for the Blazers, who quickly regressed back to previous form in a heavy loss at UConn before dropping another at Rice to fall 1-2 SU and vs. the spread on Mortensen's watch. It was a legit high in the win over the Tigers, but it has also served to warn upcoming foes, including North Texas and South Florida the next two weeks, of possible danger. Next game: Saturday vs. North TexasTim Skipper, UCLA Skipper is a veteran of the interim role, twice having served in the same capacity at Fresno State when Jeff Tedford had to step away due to health concerns. More recently, Skipper was at the helm the entire 2024 in the Central Valley and steered FSU to the Idaho Potato Bowl before joining DeShaun Foster's UCLA staff. Skipper, at least this season, has proven an upgrade from Foster, covering his first game at Northwestern before running off a shock three wins in a row, including a massive upset of Penn State, though the Bruins have cooled the last two weeks vs. Indiana and Nebraska.  If nothing else, Skipper did inject life into a lifeless program and it's worth noting the Bruins didn't lose one player to a late redshirt or anyone to the portal, which opens for a month when a coach is dismissed during a season. Results overall have been middling, but UCLA is playing better for Skipper than it did for Foster, and we're not expecting the Bruins to completely fold their tents these final three weeks, even with a couple of real challenges remaining on the slate.Next game: Saturday at Ohio State. Philip Montgomery, Virginia TechAlong with Skipper (and not including Reich), Montgomery will end up with the longest runway of any of \"The Interims\" from 2025 as it was mid-September when he was promoted from OC. To his credit, he's kept the Hokies competitive, winning three of six, with spread covers in wins vs. NC State and Cal, and seems to have settled QB Kyren Drones enough to keep the Hokies as a difficult out. While not considered a candidate for the full-time job, Montgomery is instead burnishing his future OC credentials pretty nicely. The Hokies have at least not devolved into a Colorado State-like mess on the watch of Montgomery, who once ran the offense at Baylor that RGIII used to win his Heisman, and who also served several years as HC at Tulsa. Next game: Saturday at Florida State\n            ",

    "body": "\n        NEW YORK -- Despite everything that Islam Makhachev has already accomplished in MMA, from setting the UFC lightweight record for title defenses to becoming a perennial pound-for-pound king, there's a feeling that Saturday's UFC 322 main event could be the most important challenge of his 15-year pro career. Makhachev (27-1) will look to become the 11th two-division champion in UFC history when he challenges welterweight titleholder Jack Della Maddalena (18-2) inside New York's Madison Square Garden. With a win, the 34-year-old would also tie Hall of Famer Anderson Silva for the most consecutive wins in UFC history with 16. \"I expect it's going to be a high-level fight and not just for the belt but for many things -- for legacy, for rankings, for the belt,\" Makhachev told CBS Sports on Wednesday. \"I'm very excited to fight this Saturday and this is the biggest fight of my life.\"Getting Makhachev, who vacated his 155-pound title in May, to talk specifics regarding the fighting legacy he has built isn't so easy. The proud native of Dagestan, Russia, who began training as a child under the tutelage of teammate Khabib Nurmagomedov's late father Abdulmanap, has long lived a life of discipline, humility and service to his training partners.\n\n        \n            \n                UFC 322: A look at champions who have earned second division title and those who came up short\n                \n                    Brent Brookhouse                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWith stoppage wins under his belt against the likes of Dan Hooker, Charles Oliveira, Alexander Volkanovski and Dustin Poirier (not to mention a 2019 decision win over Arman Tsarukyan), Makhachev is already in the midst of authoring one of the greatest singular runs in promotional history. But you won't get Makhachev to pause his one-dimensional mindset of sacrifice long enough to entertain any questions about whether an additional victory against Della Maddalena would cement him as one of the all-time greats in the 32-year history of the UFC. \"Myself, I don't know. I cannot say this,\" Makhachev said. \"Maybe people who make the rankings, they are going to make it. But, myself, [I'm] just focusing on hard opponent [and] to win the belt.\"Makhachev's 2015 UFC debut came and went without much fanfare as he submitted Leo Kunts via rear-naked choke in Round 2, buried deep on the early prelims of a UFC 187 pay-per-view in Las Vegas. But it was his second appearance in the Octagon at UFC 192, just five months later in Houston, that turned out to be a massive turning point in Makhachev's life and career.\nIn a moment he almost reluctantly recalls as \"a big mistake,\" Makhachev charged forward with his hands down late in Round 1 against Brazilian journeyman Adriano Martins and was flattened by a perfectly timed right hook to the jaw. Even though Makhachev never lost consciousness, the fight was instantly waived off and ruled a knockout. Two fights (and two defeats) later, Martins was cut from the UFC and would go on to close his pro career having lost six of his final seven. But Makhachev, on the other hand, would never lose again. Six years after his lone pro defeat, and following the retirement of his unbeaten teammate Nurmagomedov, Makhachev fulfilled his late coach's prophecy by submitting Oliveira at UFC 280 in 2022 to become lightweight champion.So, how important was the loss to Martins in Makhachev's evolution?  \"If you ask me, of course I want to believe this. It was something important that made me become more of a great fighter,\" Makhachev said. \"I learned a lot from this fight. Maybe, if I did not lose, I would not have become a champion.\"\nMakhachev is noticeably more thick and muscular as he prepares for his first scheduled fight at 170 pounds and he credits the unusually long layoff of 10 months for allowing him to put on the weight \"the right way,\" in a systematic approach that won't compromise his speed or power in the new weight class. It was the longest break of Makhachev's career since 2020, when injuries and COVID-19 travel issues kept him idle for 18 months.\nThe thing is, even if Makhachev hadn't been preparing for such an important move up in weight entering the biggest challenge of his pro career, the work put in behind the scenes likely would've been the same. That's because training isn't a means to an end for Makhachev as much as it's the only life he knows and/or desires. Asked about the keys to his consistency and the secret behind having authored such an impressive win streak as long as 15 inside the Octagon, where he has mostly faced elite competition in a sport where there are so many ways to lose, Makhachev didn't hesitate. \n\"Hard work,\" Makhachev said. \"I know someone who is training more than me can beat me but I know nobody training more than me. That's the key.\"In fact, when pressed with rumors regarding the idea that he might retire early while still in his physical prime (similar to Nurmagomedov) should he defeat Della Maddalena, Makhachev quickly dismissed the idea altogether by referencing the fact that he barely made it a full week while attempting to rest after his first-round submission win over Renato Moicano in January without resorting back to his preferred lifestyle.\"I started training because when you did something all of your life, you miss it,\" Makhachev said. \"I'm not good on other things [in life], I'm good in the MMA. I missed training after one week. I want to [keep] fighting and I will be fighting for more years because I feel, when I change weight now [to 170 pounds], it's easier to fight more often.\"\nShould Makhachev continue to fight on (and continue to win) as he moves up to the deepest division in the sport, it won't be long until he surpasses the legacy and achievements of Nurmagomedov, who retired in 2020 at age 32 (fulfilling a promise to his mother and late father) as the reigning P4P king with a record of 29-0 following a trio of dominant submission wins over Conor McGregor, Poirier and Justin Gaethje. In fact, considering the history Makhachev is already on the verge of achieving should he defeat Della Maddalena, there's a strong argument to be made that Makhachev could already be on the verge of eclipsing the accomplishments of Nurmagomedov this weekend. That doesn't mean Nurmagomedov, who currently trains Makhachev alongside Javier Mendez, has ever had that type of conversation with his teammate nor is it something that is ever thought about much by anyone in the camp. \"I'm going to be honest, never [have we] talked about this,\" Makhachev said. \"We never think about this, we just help each other like training partners, like brothers. When [Nurmagomedov] became a UFC fighter, I helped him and traveled with him through all training camps and now, he gives it back to me and he helps me a lot.\"\nEver a card-carrying member of the mindset that \"the journey is the destination,\" Makhachev might not be willing to speak upon his lofty accomplishments but many fans and media will happily do that for him should he become a two-division champion, equal the vaunted streak of Silva and continue to take giant steps closer toward MMA immortality.\"I just don't want people to say [I] was one of the best fighters,\" Makhachev said. \"I want people to recognize me as a good person.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\nWe were able to get good value backing the Dolphins and Titans on the lookahead spreads last week, with Miami flipping to the favorite in the Madrid game while Tennessee has gone from catching 7.5 to 6.5 at several books. Outside of those moves, the Sunday games this week have seen the Chargers, 49ers and Eagles all move up from -1.5 to either laying 2.5 or 3 points, and when you consider that was the line in the Commanders-Dolphins game as well, it's clear that 1.5 is a number that has the potential to make a key move after the Sunday rerelease.This week, we see three games that have the home team favored by 1.5 on Thursday: Steelers at Bears, Browns at Raiders, Jaguars at Cardinals. Where are those lines likely to go?In Browns-Raiders, only Cleveland will have played by the release, and it's unlikely the Browns' offense has a lot of success against the Ravens. But if the defense can limit Lamar Jackson and Co. in what could be poor weather, people may talk themselves into backing Cleveland -- we saw it happen in Week 10 when the Browns flipped from 'dogs to favorites against the Jets after the trade deadline.Steelers-Bears has the potential to flip to Pittsburgh being favored. Their offense should look much better against the Bengals' defense this week, while the Bears could struggle to have offensive success in Minnesota. If the Vikings' offense can light up a Bears defense that has been inconsistent, I could definitely see the Steelers moving to favorites here.Jaguars-Cardinals is a bit tougher to crack, but I have more hope that Jacoby Brissett is competitive against a beat-up 49ers defense than the Jaguars finding success against a Chargers defense that has been elite over the last few weeks. This might be one where Arizona reopens at -1.5 or -2 but quickly moves to -2 or -2.5.What else can we predict this week? Let's take a look at the consensus Week 12 lookahead lines and then share our best bets to lock in early.Week 12 lookahead linesBills (-2.5) at Texans, 45Patriots (-5.5) at Bengals, 51Colts at Chiefs (-4.5), 50.5Giants at Lions (-11), 49.5Vikings at Packers (-6.5), 43.5Steelers at Bears (-1.5), 46.5Jets at Ravens (-14.5), 44.5Seahawks (-12.5) at Titans, 43.5Browns at Raiders (-1.5), 37.5Jaguars at Cardinals (-1.5), 45.5Falcons (-3.5) at Saints, 41.5Eagles (-3.5) at Cowboys, 50.5Buccaneers at Rams (-6), 49.5Panthers at 49ers (-6.5), 46Week 12 lookahead picksColts at Chiefs\nThe Colts are off this week, so this comes down to how the Chiefs perform against the Broncos. But even if that one is a blowout, I struggle to see how you can give the Colts this many points with how well they've played. If the Chiefs lose, this could reopen at 3. I'd take the 4.5 now with Indianapolis and expect that even if the opener is Chiefs -4.5 or -5, that the market will knock it down to at least Chiefs -4 pretty quickly.Falcons at Saints\nThis again comes down to how one team performs with the Saints off this week, but considering the Falcons are only laying 3.5 against a Panthers team that was just beat convincingly by New Orleans, anything other than a Falcons rout against Carolina will make this clearly a spot where the Saints should be catching a field goal at most. The Panthers had just 175 yards against the Saints, so I don't know how the Falcons are going to beat that performance defensively on Sunday.Bills at Texans\nThe Texans are coming off an impressive win against the Jaguars without C.J. Stroud, but their line against the Titans has moved against them this week. And with a low total, there's potential for the market to be unimpressed by what it sees from Houston on Sunday. The Bills are picking up the pieces after an embarrassing loss that has them at depressed value in the market, and we'll see if they bounce back against the Bucs. I see this having more potential to reopen at Bills -3 than lower than -2.5.Other notes: Eagles-Cowboys is unlikely to move on reopen with both teams playing in primetime on Sunday and Monday, but by Tuesday I could see the Eagles as much bigger favorites if they are able to cover against a great Lions team, which the market expects by moving that line from 1.5 to 2.5. Maybe people buy in to the Cowboys' defense if their trade acquisitions have a great game against the Raiders, but I see more potential for this to rise to where we see the Patriots-Bengals game where the Pats are -5.5 ... It's hard to say that you should grab a -14.5 before it goes up, but I don't see a scenario where anyone is playing the Jets at that number in Baltimore. If we're lucky, we might be able to grab -14 on the reopen, but there's potential for this to get to 17 in a hurry.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Calvin Johnson's 2012 season remains the most prolific in NFL history, as his 1,964 yards remains the record for receiving yards in a single season. That record remaining in his name for the past 12 years has surprised the Hall of Famer, who assumed that it would've been \"gone a couple years ago\" for a couple reasons.  \"I was expecting more of an explosion as far as what we see for yards per season. And just my record, for instance, I didn't expect that to still be standing at this point,\" Johnson told Kevin Clark on This Is Football. \"One, they added a game and two, you can't really touch the receiver nowadays. So, I expected that thing to be gone a couple years ago when guys were getting close but it still hasn't fallen.\"Johnson explained that with the continued crackdown on physicality by defensive backs, the addition of a 17th game and the number of elite receivers in the league, he didn't expect to still sit atop the NFL's record books. As for which of today's receivers have a chance, he highlighted a few names you'd expect, but also a rookie that came as a bit of a surprise. \n\"Ja'Marr Chase has a chance if his quarterback is healthy,\" Johnson said. \"Justin Jefferson. I thought Tyreek [Hill] would have a chance, but I don't know after his injury. Cause he was there a couple years where he was [1,700], [1,800], he might've even hit [1,900]. I don't know right now -- oh, what's the young kid in Tampa? I like this kid [Emeka Egbuka], I'm keeping my radar on him. He could be really good. And there's definitely young guys I'm leaving out.\"When asked about Seahawks receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba, who leads the NFL in receiving this year, Johnson acknowledged his incredible play this season and noted \"if there's somebody that's gonna have a chance this year, it'd be him.\"Smith-Njigba could do just that. He needs to continue averaging 115 yards per game over his final eight games, as he has for the first nine games, to break Johnson's record. His 85 targets are nearly triple the next most on Seattle (35 for Cooper Kupp), and if he maintains that kind of target share and Seattle continues to let Sam Darnold sling it downfield, he could threaten Johnson's record.\nThere have been some receivers who threatened the mark, namely Cooper Kupp in 2021 when he finished with 1,947 yards. As Johnson noted, Justin Jefferson went over 1,800 yards in 2022, Hill hit 1,799 yards in 2023 and CeeDee Lamb went for 1,749 yards in the same year.The challenge for anyone trying to break Johnson's record is that even with the additional game, offenses throwing more and the way the game is called, it's hard to get the kind of target share Johnson got in that 2012 season. He had a staggering 204 targets that season -- the most of his career by 46 -- and the leader last year in targets was Chase with 175. Modern NFL offenses definitely pass the ball more on the whole, but few throw that much to a single receiver and those Lions teams were a bit ahead of their time when it came to the volume of passing they did. Matthew Stafford's 727 attempts that 2012 season would've been 75 more than the leader in pass attempts last year -- Joe Burrow at 652. \nFor those reasons, Johnson's record may be safe for a bit longer, even as players have an extra game to try and catch him. If the league ever adds an 18th game, it will almost assuredly fall, but still will take a special season which only further proves how outrageous his 2012 campaign was. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Be it injuries, lackluster play or other factors, we see NFL betting lines move quite a bit every week. Week 11 is no different, as spreads and totals have risen and shrunk across a handful of games, including Thursday Night Football and Sunday Night Football. As we do every week, we break down the most notable NFL line movement and biggest shifts for Week 11. All odds are courtesy of BetMGM Sportsbook, where new users get up to $1,500 in bonus bets if their first bet loses:New York Jets at New England Patriots (8:15 p.m. ET, Thursday)Open: Patriots -10.5, O/U 45.5Now: Patriots -13, O/U 43\nWeek 11 kicks off with a Thursday Night Football battle between two AFC East foes. The Patriots are 8-2, have won seven in a row and are atop the division. The Jets are 2-7, though they have won two in a row. New York's offense still has a ton of question marks, especially at quarterback where it's clear Justin Fields isn't the guy. Whether it's Fields or Tyrod Taylor starting on Thursday, the Jets won't be passing to star receiver Garrett Wilson, who is set to miss a few weeks with a knee injury. This line has moved in New England's favor by 2.5 points, making it the biggest spread of the Week 11 slate. The total has also dropped 2.5 points to 43.Houston Texans at Tennessee Titans (1 p.m. ET)Open: Texans -7.5Now: Texans -6.5\nThe Texans may not be able to repeat as AFC South champs for the third year in a row, but they can still make a run at a wild card spot. At 4-5 and facing a 1-8 Titans team, this is absolutely a must-win spot for Houston. The big story to watch here is C.J. Stroud, who missed last week's comeback win over the Jacksonville Jaguars with a concussion. Stroud is still in concussion protocol as of Thursday and if he can't go, Davis Mills would start once again. Houston is still a sizable favorite on the road, but the spread has shrunk from 7.5 to 6.5.Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Buffalo Bills (1 p.m. ET)Open: O/U 50.5Now: O/U 48\nThe Bucs and Bills are each coming off tough losses with Tampa dropping a close decision to New England and Buffalo suffering a shocking blowout loss to the Miami Dolphins. This is one of the better games of the weekend on paper between two top contenders, but the total has dropped from 50.5 to 48 since lines were first revealed. The Buccaneers are still trying to see if Bucky Irving and Chris Godwin can return as both were limited Wednesday. The Bills will be without top tight end Dalton Kincaid, who leads the team in touchdown receptions and is second in yards.  Chicago Bears at Minnesota Vikings (1 p.m. ET)Open: O/U 45.5 Now: O/U 48.5\nThe total for this NFC North matchup has shot up three whole points since it opened at 45.5. The Bears have allowed the fifth-most points per game this year and the Vikings are 18th in scoring defense after ranking among the NFL's elite in nearly every category last year. These teams combined for 51 points back in Week 1. Keep an eye on the Bears' injuries at receiver as both Rome Odunze and DJ Moore missed practice Wednesday. Green Bay Packers at New York Giants (1 p.m. ET)Open: O/U 44.5Now: O/U 42.5\nThis is a brand-new week for the Giants. Brian Daboll is out as head coach and offensive coordinator Mike Kafka will be the team's interim head coach. Additionally, rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart is out and instead of Russell Wilson starting, it'll be Jameis Winston under center for New York. It's unclear what this Giants team will look like with Kafka running the show and Winston at quarterback. Additionally, the Packers scored just seven points on Monday against Philadelphia. Baltimore Ravens at Cleveland Browns (4:25 p.m. ET)Open: Ravens -8.5, O/U 41.5Now: Ravens -7.5, O/U 39.5 \nThe Ravens have won three in a row and, at 4-5, are right on the heels of the 5-4 Pittsburgh Steelers for the AFC North lead. Baltimore has had Lamar Jackson back the last two weeks, but he missed practice Wednesday. What makes that so noteworthy is instead of the hamstring injury that cost him roughly a month this season, it's a knee injury. Baltimore is still a big favorite over 2-7 Cleveland, but the spread has dropped a point and the total is down two points. Plus, Cleveland is No. 2 in total defense this year, which is a saving grace considering the Browns' offense is a mess. Detroit Lions at Philadelphia Eagles (8:20 p.m. ET)Open: Eagles -1.5, O/U 49.5Now: Eagles -2.5, O/U 46.5\nInjuries were a key part of the Lions' 2024 campaign, and they may be starting to pile up ahead of a Sunday Night Football tilt with the Eagles. Three key starters on defense, including star edge rusher Aidan Hutchinson, missed practice Wednesday. So did All-Pro right tackle Penei Sewell and star tight end Sam LaPorta. The Eagles are now favored by 2.5 points at home, and the total has dropped by three to 46.5. Philly has plenty of question marks as well entering this game after scoring just 10 points on Monday against the Packers. The Eagles' offense is in a bad way right now, and star receiver A.J. Brown is making his frustrations well known. Additionally, last year's incredible run game behind Saquon Barkley really isn't clicking yet, and Philadelphia's perennially stellar offensive line has been beat up and less effective than a year ago.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Welcome to the Thursday edition of the Pick Six newsletter!We are exactly two weeks away from Thanksgiving, and we have a lot to be thankful for tonight because we get to watch the New York Jets play! Sure, the Jets offense set football back 50 years in Week 10 with just 42 passing yards, but they won and that's all that matters. That means they're now on a two-game winning streak, and they'll be putting it on the line against the Patriots tonight at 8:15 p.m. ET on Amazon. In today's newsletter, we'll have some picks and best bets for tonight's game, plus we have some playoff projections and we're going to take a look at the best and worst rookie for each team this year. As always, here's your reminder to tell all your friends to sign up for the newsletter. Let's get to the rundown. 1. Thursday night preview: Picks and best bets for Jets at Patriots\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            The Patriots (8-2) will be looking to be the first NFL team to hit nine wins this year, but to pull that off, they'll have to beat a feisty Jets team that has suddenly won two games in a row. The Jets are 12.5-point underdogs, but they might have some confidence going into the game because they've won two of their past three against the Patriots. \nEven if you're not a huge fan of either team, you might want to check out the game just so you can see New England's new \"Rivalries\" uniform. The Patriots will be wearing their Storm Blue 'Nor'Easter' jerseys for the first time ever. Anyway, here's one reason why each team should be feeling confident going into the game:Why the Jets can win: If the Jets have been good at one thing this year, it's running the football. Heading into Week 11, New York is averaging 141.8 yards per game, which is the fourth-highest number in the NFL. Both of the Jets' wins this season came in games where they rushed for at least 125 yards, so if they can get Breece Hall going, they might be able to pull off the upset. However, it won't be easy to run the ball, because they'll be facing a Patriots team that has been the best in the NFL at stopping the run this year, giving up just 79.5 rushing yards per game. Why the Patriots can win: There's a reason the Patriots are favored by almost two touchdowns, and that's because they're the better team. If New England plays smart football, it should win. That means no turnovers, especially by Drake Maye. The Patriots are 3-2 this year when he throws an interception, but 5-0 when he doesn't. They also need to protect Maye. Both of New England's losses came in games where he got sacked at least four times. If they protect Maye and don't turn the ball over, they should be able to score at least 20 points. The Patriots are undefeated (7-0) this year when they've been able to hit that magic number. You can get a full preview of the game here from Jordan Dajani.If you're thinking about betting on the game, here are a couple of props (odds via BetMGM):\nONE QB PROP I LIKE: Drake Maye over 266.5 passing and rushing yards (-115): The Patriots QB has gone over this total in five straight games, and I won't be surprised if he makes it six straight. The Patriots will be missing a top running back (Rhamondre Stevenson) and a top receiver (Kayshon Boutte), so that could lead to a situation where Maye feels like he has to pick up the slack. Maye has gone over 266.5 PASSING yards in two of his past three games, so he might be able to hit the over here without even including the rushing yards. ONE KICKING PROP I LIKE: Nick Folk OVER 4.5 points (-140): The Jets have a horrible offense, but this is the lowest point total I've ever seen for a kicker so I have to take it. (That's right, Vegas has sucked me in with this number.) Folk is AVERAGING 7.7 points per game this year, and he's scored at least six points in eight of the Jets' nine games. The Patriots have a good defense, so this could certainly blow up in my face, but I think Folk can get to five points. If you're wondering how my props are doing this year, I'm 22-22 (8-12 on kicker props and 14-10 on all other props).Now, it's time for some picks. PICKS FOR 'TNF'Pete Prisco's pick: Patriots 30-10 over JetsMy pick: Patriots 24-13 over JetsTyler Sullivan's pick: Patriots 30-16 over JetsJordan Dajani's pick: Patriots 30-10 over JetsJared Dubin's pick: Patriots 27-10 over JetsWe've got some more picks for the game over on our CBSSports.com predictions page. \n2. NFL playoff projections heading into Week 11With the NFL schedule now in mid-November, you might be wondering which teams have the best chance of making the playoffs this year. Well, I was also wondering that, so to figure out who's going to make the playoffs, we had Stephen Oh of SportsLine simulate the rest of the season. We then used those simulations to project the 14 teams we expect to make the playoffs. Here's how our projection breaks down for both conferences: AFC1. Patriots2. Broncos3. Colts4. Ravens5. Bills6. Chargers7. ChiefsFirst team out: SteelersOne reason the Patriots are projected to finish at the top of the AFC is because not only are they currently tied for the best record in the conference, but they also have the easiest remaining strength of schedule. The Patriots' SOS is at .358, while no other AFC team is even under .430. \nNFC1. Rams2. Eagles3. Buccaneers4. Lions5. Seahawks6. Packers7. 49ersFirst team out: BearsIn news that may or may not surprise you, the EAGLES are currently the team favored to win it all, according to our projection. If you want more details on the projections, including the individual playoff chances for all 32 teams, be sure to click here. 3. NFL Week 11 picks: Lions take down Eagles; Bills get back on track vs. Buccaneers\n                                                                    USATSI\n                                                            It's now time for your favorite part of the newsletter, which is where Pete Prisco, Jordan Dajani and Tyler Sullivan give me their picks and then I give them to you. Last week, Sullivan blew us out of the water by going 11-3 with his picks, so if that's any indication of what's going to happen this week, you should pay extra close attention to his picks for Week 11. \nAnyway, if you're new here, here's how things work: I'll give you one Week 11 pick from each writer and then link you to the rest of their picks for the week. That way, if you like their pick, you can click over and check out all their Week 11 selections. If you hate it, you can ignore the rest and move on with your life.Pete Prisco -- Bills (-5.5) 30-23 over Buccaneers. \"This is a big game for both teams, but much bigger for the Bills. They looked awful in losing to Miami last week. The Bucs might be going into a game against a team that is desperate to get a win. Josh Allen didn't play well last week. He will in this one. Bills take it.\" Prisco's full Week 11 picks are here. Tyler Sullivan -- Lions (+2.5) 27-24 over Eagles. \"Backing the Lions in prime time is always a good way to lean as they are 13-2 straight up over the last four seasons when under the prime-time lights. Detroit is also 12-6 ATS as an underdog over the last four seasons.\" Sullivan's full Week 11 picks are here. Jordan Dajani -- Chiefs 24-21 over Broncos (+3.5). \"Nix is 1-1 vs. the Chiefs, and has completed 81% of his passes with six touchdowns and zero interceptions while averaging 9.1 yards per attempt in those games. Chiefs win, but I'm going to take the home dog to cover.\" Dajani's full slate of picks will be released on Friday, but you can get a preview here. John Breech -- Rams (-2.5) 27-24 over Seahawks. \"If you're going to slow down the Seahawks passing attack, the easiest way to do that is to sack Sam Darnold, and no one knows how to do that better than the Rams. Last year, Darnold went 14-3 with the Vikings and that broke down like this: He went 0-2 against the Rams and 14-1 against everyone else. In those two losses to the Rams, Darnold got sacked a total of 12 times. Darnold is obviously in a completely different situation this year, but he always seems to struggle when he's under pressure. Rams defensive coordinator Chris Shula is very well aware of how to slow Darnold down and I won't be surprised if he dials up the pressure on Sunday.\" You can find the rest of my Week 11 picks here. For more Week 11 NFL picks, you can check out our CBSSports.com picks page. 4. Best and worst rookie for all 32 teamsSince we're now more than halfway through the NFL season, we can now tell which rookies have been making an impact this year and which ones haven't done much of anything. With that in mind, Josh Edwards went through and ranked the best and most disappointing rookie for each team.  Let's check out some of the players who made his \"most disappointing\" list: Steelers: RB Kaleb Johnson. \"Johnson has been the most disappointing because he seemed like such a good fit for Pittsburgh's offense. Instead, the team has given carries to Jaylen Warren and Kenneth Gainwell.\"Chiefs: DT Omarr Norman-Lott. \"Neither edge rusher Ashton Gillotte nor Norman-Lott has fulfilled the team's vision. Those two positions were targeted by the team at the trade deadline. Norman-Lott was personally rated more highly, so the expectation is that he would at least supplement the pass rush. After five games, he went on injured reserve and was lost for the season.\"Raider: WR Jack Bech. \"Bech and Dont'e Thornton Jr. have been almost non-existent in an offense that no longer has Jakobi Meyers. Its leading receiver in Week 10 against Denver was 33-year-old Tyler Lockett.\"Packers: OT Anthony Belton. \"With an unsettled offensive line, one would have thought Belton would compete for a larger role, especially given injuries.\"If you want to read Edwards' full breakdown of this year's rookie class, be sure to check out his story here. \n5. Ranking bad teams by their future outlook\n                                                                    USATSI\n                                                            Once the NFL schedule hits November, it seems like we only talk about the good teams and the playoff race, so we wanted to change things up by talking about the bad teams. Jared Dubin decided he wanted to offer some hope to a few of the bad teams out there, so he decided to rank every team with three wins or less based on how bright their future is. Let's check out his top two teams: 1. Bengals (3-6). 2. Cowboys (3-5-1). Dubin's take: \"These two teams are essentially a legitimate defense away from being real playoff teams. They have two of the most explosive offenses in the NFL, and still can't manage to win games because they simply can't stop anybody. If either one of them can figure out a way to level up defensively, they could quickly make a move up the standings in their respective conferences. Maybe not all the way to the top, but certainly into the playoff picture.\"Now, let's check out the bottom two teams: 11. Saints (2-8)12. Raiders (2-7)Dubin's take: \"We have the Raiders last because they basically have two players (Brock Bowers and Maxx Crosby) worth building around and not much else. They seem like they might need to abandon their new coaching staff after just one year. And their quarterback situation with Geno Smith is looking like a nightmare.   The Saints also don't have much talent, but they at least have more clarity about their quarterback situation: they need to go out and find a new one.\"\nIf you're a fan of a team with three wins or less, then you're definitely going to want to check out Dubin's full story. 6. Extra points: Justin Tucker landing spotsIt's been a busy 24 hours in the NFL, and since it's nearly impossible to keep track of everything that happened, I went ahead and put together a roundup for you. Justin Tucker's 10-game suspension is over. After serving a 10-game suspension, Justin Tucker is officially eligible to return to the NFL this week, so we decided to put together a few landing spots. One team that would definitely make sense is the Los Angeles Rams. If you want to see who else would make sense for Tucker, be sure to check out my story here. Travis Hunter might not play both ways in the future. With Hunter now out for the season due to an LCL injury, the Jaguars are suddenly starting to re-think how they might use him in the future. Coach Liam Coen wouldn't commit to anything when asked if Hunter would continue to be a two-way player. We broke down what might come next for Hunter and which position might make more sense for him. You can read our full story on that here. Drew Brees returning to the announcer's booth. The former Saints QB, who once worked for NBC, will be back in the announcer's booth this week working for Fox. Brees will be calling the Packers-Giants game at MetLife Stadium on Sunday, which is almost perfect, because his former teammate, Jameis Winston, is expected to start for the Giants. CBS Sports actually got a chance to talk to Brees this week, and you can check out our full interview here. A.J. Brown drama continues for Philadelphia. The Eagles star receiver vented about his team during a live stream this week, calling things a \"shit show.\" During a press conference on Wednesday, Eagles coach Nick Sirianni seemed a little tired answering questions about Brown: \"I'm close to being done answering these questions with this. \"He's working hard and he is a big part of this game plan and he'll be a big part of the game plan going forward.\" Brown said he's not going to apologize for his comments. If you want the full breakdown of all the drama, we've got that here. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 season could not have gone much worse for the Mets. New York won 89 games and went to the NLCS in 2024, signed Juan Soto in the offseason, then won 83 games and missed the postseason in 2025. A shutout loss to the Marlins on the final day of the season sent the Reds to the playoffs and the Mets home. Now POBO David Stearns must pick up the pieces this winter. \"I'm the architect of the team. I'm responsible for it,\" Stearns said after the season. \"... (We were) a team that underachieved greatly. We know that. I certainly know that.  And we're gonna work really hard to fix that going forward, learn from  this, and do a heck of a lot better.\"   The Mets finished the season with a $342 million payroll for competitive balance tax purposes, according to Cot's Baseball Contracts. That was second only to the World Series champion Dodgers. Including arbitration projections, the Mets have about $250 million on the books in 2026. That gives them plenty of money to spend, and of course owner Steven Cohen could spend more.What do the Mets need this offseason? Who could they target? Who could they move? Let's dive into that now in our offseason preview for one of baseball's most disappointing teams in 2025. \n Needs The Mets have rotation depth -- seven of the nine pitchers who made five starts in 2025 are healthy and under contract/team control in 2026 -- but they lack an ace. They have a collection of No. 3 starter types, many of who ran out of steam late in the season. A bona fide No. 1 starter, a true frontline pitcher who can start Game 1 in October, is surely atop the offseason shopping list. Stearns said improving the team defense is a must this offseason and there are four positions the Mets can easily do that: first base, second base, third base, and center field. Pete Alonso opted out of his contract, and while we can't rule out a reunion, it seems less likely this offseason than last. The team's in-house third basemen (Brett Baty, Mark Vientos, etc.) won't stand in the way of anything. Like Alonso, Edwin Díaz opted out his contract this offseason, creating a ninth-inning void in a bullpen that was already short one or two (or three) quality arms. It's a pretty lengthy offseason to-do list. The Mets need an ace, most of a bullpen, an improved defense, and lineup length. Too many nights this past summer their 7-8-9 hitters put up little resistance. \n Possible targets Even if they make righty Nolan McLean and shortstop/center fielder Jett Williams off-limits, the Mets are not short on high quality prospects to trade this offseason. They also have lots of money to spend. The Mets have the resources to get anyone they want this offseason. Whether free agents or trade partners want what they have to offer is another matter. \nIf the Mets are going to spend significant dollars on a 30-something corner infielder, Alex Bregman is a much better fit than Alonso. Bregman is a capable middle-of-the-order righty bat and would improve the infield defense considerably. The Mets could slide Vientos over to first, where he fits best defensively, and Baty looked competent in his limited second base time. Signing Bregman and letting Alonso leave would for sure improve the Mets defensively at one position (third base) and could improve them at as many as three positions (also first and second bases). Bregman has to be a consideration this winter. \nCould the Mets lure an outfielder away from the Yankees for the second straight offseason? Cody Bellinger remains a strong center fielder defensively, plus he's shown he can bounce between the outfield corners and first base pretty seamlessly. He provides an element of versatility you usually don't get from a player who spent most of his most recent season in an outfield corner. That would come in handy when top prospect Carson Benge is ready to take over center field. That could be fairly early in 2026. Bellinger would also provide lineup length and the Mets already know he would have no trouble playing in New York. \nIf the Tigers make ace Tarik Skubal available, you have to figure the Mets will be at the front of the line. They have the prospects to trade and the need atop the rotation, plus the financial wherewithal to sign him to the largest pitching contract in history when he becomes a free agent next offseason. The question isn't so much if the Mets can swing a trade for Skubal. It's if the Tigers are willing to trade him. Skubal would make every rotation better and that goes double for a Mets team lacking an ace. \nMy guess is a Díaz reunion is more likely than an Alonso reunion, though I would not assume a bringing back the closer is inevitable. Stearns is not keen on committing long-term to pitchers and Díaz, even at age 31, could command a four- or five-year contract. Robert Suarez, most recently of the Padres, opted out of his contract to become a free agent this winter, like Díaz. He will turn 35 in March, so he won't require as long of a contract, and Suarez could be every bit as good as Díaz the next few years. Signing Suarez could be a smarter move than re-signing Díaz. Shorter term contract and little to no drop in performance, potentially. \nThe Red Sox have more outfielders than outfield spots and it feels like it's time to do something about it. Jarren Duran, 29, is older and closer to free agency than Wilyer Abreu, Roman Anthony, Ceddanne Rafaela, et al, making him the obvious trade candidate. The Mets could put him in center field, a position he is more than capable of playing, until Benge arrives, then slide Durran over to left and get lockdown defense there. Durran would bring a dynamic power/speed threat to the lineup as well. The Mets have pitching to trade and need an outfielder. The Red Sox have outfielders to trade and need pitching. Hmmm. \n Possible trade chips Baty, Vientos, and Ronny Mauricio give the Mets more young infielders who need at-bats than there are at-bats to give. Making all three available and seeing what the trade market turns up is a sensible move. It never hurts to listen, you know? I suspect the Mets would like to unload Jeff McNeil and might even be willing to eat some of the $17.75 million he's owed in 2026 to make it happen. McLean is presumably untouchable. There's no reason to make Brandon Sproat or Jonah Tong off-limits though, ditto Christian Scott, who is nearing the end of his Tommy John surgery rehab. Others like infielders Jacob Reimer and A.J. Ewing, and slugger Ryan Clifford, are exactly the kind of second-tier prospects a team like the Mets should be willing to trade for immediate MLB help. MLB Pipeline ranked New York's farm system seventh best in baseball after the trade deadline. They have high-end prospects to trade for a difference-making big leaguer, and also Grade B and C prospects to move for smaller upgrades. Don't forget their ability to take on salary too. We should count that as a trade chip. Eating money has pushed many a trade across the finish line. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Y'all know the phrase, \"There's nothing new under the sun,\" correct? The idea that there are no new ideas might be a bit of a stretch, but there's something to the idea of repeating history -- both good and bad. The same can be said about modern NFL offenses. The era of big boy football has returned, with tight ends and extra offensive linemen seeing more time in the sunlight than a houseplant in the winter. At the forefront of this offensive evolution are two teams that'll square off on Sunday afternoon: the Seattle Seahawks and Los Angeles Rams. Two teams will be fighting not only for the right to call themselves the best team in the NFC, but in the entire NFL. Since Week 7, both the Rams and Seahawks have been in the top 10 of overall Success Rate as an offense, with two quarterbacks playing at MVP-caliber levels: Matthew Stafford and Sam Darnold. \n        \n            \n                Who will win the NFC? Why Week 11 matchups will redefine the conference race for these four contenders\n                \n                    Douglas Clawson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBut that's not where the rubber meets the road just yet, when it comes to why both of these offenses have blasted opposing defenses lately. Since Week 7, Los Angeles has faced the highest percentage of snaps against base defense (four defensive backs) in the NFL at 51%, and Seattle isn't that far behind at 45.4%. While the goal for both teams is to shred the base defense in the passing game, how they have achieved this is where these two paths diverge.What the Rams are doingWhen star wide receiver Puka Nacua went down with an injury in the Rams' Week 6 win over the Baltimore Ravens, the Rams' entire offense had to change. Not only is Nacua one of the NFL's most impactful receivers in the passing game, but with Nacua on the field, they didn't lose any strength in the run game. He was essentially a tight end in the run game, tasked with clearing out defenders inside the tackle box. The problem with that was that teams could defend them in nickel, defending their run game just as they would any other team in 11 personnel. To keep the Rams on the cutting edge of modern NFL offense, coach Sean McVay would have to change his stripes once again. The Rams have never really majored in anything outside of 11 personnel, but without Nacua and nickel defenses becoming much better suited to defend the Rams' run game, McVay decided to add tight ends on the field to ease some of the issues they were having.\nNot only have the Rams eased some of their issues, but they've also become a machine on offense. Since Week 7, the Rams are first in EPA per play and Success Rate, and quarterback Matthew Stafford has been on a tear. I think Tom Brady had the best explanation for why the Rams have shredded teams in base defense lately, via AJ Schulte of A to Z Sports: \"The interesting thing about 11 personnel is that there's probably 20-25 different coverage combinations you can face as a QB. When you go to a 3 TE grouping and they play base defense, you're dealing with 3 or 4 combinations. So it simplifies the defensive playbook by about 20%, so many fewer looks for QBs to diagnose post-snap, and allows you as a play-caller to dial up exactly what you want.\" What Brady is saying is that when you play a heavier defense with more linebackers on the field, it's a lot harder to scheme around the coverage limitations of a linebacker than to scheme around the run defense limitations of a nickel corner. Against the 49ers, when the Rams were in 13 personnel, the Niners played Cover 3 on 17 of the 31 snaps, which is approximately a 55% clip. When you line up in single high and play Cover 3 as obviously as the Niners did, that's just making the game easier for one of the best QBs in the game right now. McVay has decided that it's easier to draw up winning passing combos for a tight end like Terrance Ferguson against a linebacker instead of trying to scheme up WRs Jordan Whittington or Konata Mumpfield against a shiftier nickel corner, and the results are paying off in a big way. Ferguson has come on strong in the last three weeks, averaging a strong 3.3 Yards Per Route Run (third in the NFL among TEs). He's their matchup nightmare, capable of doing this to linebackers:\nOr, using Ferguson's long speed to create voids for wide receiver Davante Adams, like on this play here:\nWith bigger-bodied TEs on the field more often now, they can also use these players to unlock more varied parts of their run game. Bigger bodies allow for their offensive linemen to get to the second level, with tight ends being able to base block EDGEs if necessary. Or, you can insert them with more success against linebackers than a smaller player like Whittington would.\nMcVay has reinvented himself and the Rams offense once again, and it has them sitting pretty near the top of the NFC.\nWhat the Seahawks are doingNot to be outdone, the Seahawks' offense has been one of the league's most impressive buzzsaws against base personnel, crushing teams using the pass when they get into heavy looks. Quarterback Sam Darnold has a 0.53 EPA per dropback on plays where base defense is on the field, and that explosiveness matches up with how far downfield he's throwing the ball against base defenses. Darnold is averaging an absurd 12.9 yards per pass attempt against base, matching his strong arm and penchant for explosives with slower linebackers on the field. The Seahawks primarily do this out of 12- and 21-personnel formations, forcing teams to account for their big guys on the field -- despite having a run game that hasn't been particularly explosive or successful on the ground this season. Having these larger personnel groupings on the field has allowed Kubiak and Darnold to create the illusion of a run, thereby moving the linebackers. Then Darnold can take his shots downfield, primarily to wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba. This is very tidy work by Darnold, but watch the linebackers move for Arizona. \nBecause of how good the Seahawks are at hitting those over routes off play action, the defense has to make a choice: They can choose to let their linebackers flow fast with the run action and play their safeties hard on the over routes, or they can sit back and slow play the run with their second level. If you choose the first option, that's when Darnold really lets the ball fly. This beautiful touchdown to JSN is a great illustration of that. The Cardinals are sending a blitz, but they also play their linebackers fast. The safety jumps all over this route, but it leaves Smith-Njigba in a 1v1 matchup, which he then proceeds to win. Tough to answer so many questions.\nThis leads us to Sunday, a heavyweight fight between two teams that are all about dicing base defense as a passing unit. The question that'll have to be answered on both sides is this: Can you force the other teams' defense into base personnel? The Seahawks play nickel (five DBs) at a 58.3% clip against 13 personnel, by far the most in the NFL (second is the New England Patriots at 35.5%). Seattle hasn't really been tested often by a team that wants to run the ball out of 13 personnel; TruMedia only charts them with nine rushing attempts defended against 13 personnel, but on those runs, Seattle has given up a mere 20% Success Rate. Seattle plays the least amount of base defense in the NFL, but still has only given up 3.7 yards per carry all season. Where the Seahawks lack in pure size on the field defensively, they make up for it by being absolute banshees defending the run. Mike Macdonald is unafraid of using run blitzes to steal gaps and force offensive linemen to think on the fly as they zone block, having to account for defenders who weren't there. That creates base defense front structures out of lighter personnel box counts, never having to sacrifice coverage bodies against the run. On this play, linebacker Drake Thomas and safety Ty Okada blitz, leaving nobody to account for Pat O'Donnell on the backside, who can clean up the carnage Thomas leaves.When you watch the Seahawks' defense on Sunday, be aware of linebackers and secondary members who will bring the heat on run downs to change the picture defensively. For the Rams, they play a lot of base defense against 12 and 21 personnel, but something that Greg Olsen said has been stuck in my mind lately about how to attack this Seahawks' offense:\nWhat to expect on SundayI wonder if this is the game where the Seahawks see more nickel against their 12- and 21-personnel formations, due to the Rams' size up front. Having Poona Ford, Jared Verse and the L.A. wrecking crew up front should help defend the run game, but leaving their linebackers isolated in coverage might not be the wisest thing to do. Whatever the Rams do, they'll have to ensure they limit explosive passes, because that's how the Seahawks typically attack.Football is cyclical, with ideas constantly being passed from one generation to the next, and old ideas becoming new again. This game is a perfect example of that -- multiple tight ends, fullbacks, play action and launching the ball downfield. How each defense reacts to this could be the way forward in the NFL as the push and pull for on-field supremacy continues.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 NBA season is almost a month old and already this rookie class is exceeding expectations on a lot of fronts. This may go down as one of the deepest classes in recent memory, especially after last season's batch of players weren't as productive right out of the gate. That hasn't been the case this year and it's not crazy to say that every guy taken with the first five picks has serious star potential. Ace Bailey is the only one of those five who hasn't put up major numbers, but even he jut had a 20-point performance in Utah's most recent game. It was Bailey's second start of the season and he shot over 50% from the floor and 3-point range. He's now logged back-to-back starts for the Jazz, which could become the norm as Utah prioritizes its young talent.          With enough game footage to review now, it seems like the perfect time to roll out the first volume of Rookie Rankings for the 2025-26 season. Important to note, Derek Harper isn't included on this top-5 ranking and that's simply because he's been sidelined the last five games with a a left calf strain. He's expected to miss multiple weeks, so I thought it was best to not include him in the ranking. Had he been healthy, he certainly would've cracked the top 5 as he was averaging 14 points on 50% from the floor with four rebounds and 3.8 assists off the bench for the Spurs.           Harper's shown great feel for the game, well beyond someone who is just 19 years old. When he's able to return healthy it will be interesting to see how Spurs coach Mitch Johnson handles the backcourt rotation. San Antonio has four quality guards in the backcourt and it should be fairly easy to manage minutes to allow for all of them to get their time. But as Harper continues to develop, there may come a point later in the season where it would be foolish to have him and Fox to be sharing the same workload.          That's something we'll keep an eye on over the course of the season. But let's get into these rankings and break down the top five rookies through the first three weeks of the NBA season.\nThere isn't a rookie more relentless in attacking the rim than Fears. No really, 32% of his shots come at the rim, which ranks in the 91st percentile, per Cleaning The Glass. His combination of speed, handles and body control allows him to put constant pressure on the rim. He's making them at a 67% clip, which is decent enough for a rookie, and if he's able to hone that skill, it'll open other aspects of his game. As the defense collapses to account for his constant rim pressure, he'll be able to kick it out to the perimeter to get his teammates easier looks.          He's confident in taking 3s and his accuracy is starting to catch up with him. He's shooting 36% from deep in the last five games, which is forcing opponents to play him tighter to run him off the line, but that allows him to get to his strength and attack the rim.          With Zion Williamson sidelined again, Fears -- along with fellow rookie Derik Queen -- is providing a sliver of hope for a Pelicans team that has been rudderless for the last five years.\nFlagg's slowly starting to perform at the level many expected him to as soon as he stepped into the league, but it's still a bit awkward given his fit on a clunky Mavericks roster. A team with zero creators or quality (healthy) point guards is heavily impacting Flagg's ability to truly spread his wings. But with some needed front office changes, some roster reconstruction may follow too if the Mavericks' charted path forward is to focus on building around Flagg for the future.       Still, the 18-year-old is doing things that very few his age have accomplished. He's just the second player in NBA history to record multiple games of at least 15 points, five rebounds and five assists before turning 19 years old. Flagg joins LeBron James as the only other player to accomplish that feat and he'll likely rack up more games of that statline before he blows out his candles on Dec. 21.          He's also showing no fear for the big moments, like this tough finish in a loss to the Bucks. Flagg wasn't deterred by the fact that Giannis Antetokounmpo was waiting for him under the basket.          \nFlagg's offense can't really be analyzed fairly given he's been playing out of position for a bulk of the season. Mavericks coach Jason Kidd has played him at point guard for several games this season, to little success, but that's no fault of Flagg, who has never played the position before. He's at his best when he can catch the ball on the move and use his athleticism to finish above the rim or break a defender down in space and get into the paint. We've seen an uptick of that over the last few games, but with poor spacing around him, we haven't been able to see Flagg's full abilities unleashed yet.          Defensively, though, Flagg is as sound as many expected him to be on that end. He's moving his feet, always engaged and flying in from out of nowhere to deflect or block shots. Even if he gets beat on a drive, he's recovering and taking two giant steps to propel himself off the ground to still try an impact a shot.          \nIn the wake of Nico Harrison's dismissal, though, it relieves some of that pressure that plagued the Mavericks to start the season. The hope is that the Mavericks can put Flagg in a better position to succeed and have the type of rookie season indicative of a Rookie of the Year candidate.\nKnueppel is on pace to shatter the rookie 3-point record currently held by Keegan Murray at 206 made 3s. Knueppel has already made 32 in 10 games and is on pace to total roughly 262. His 3-point shooting alone makes him a great complimentary piece alongside LaMelo Ball. But in Ball's absence in the last four games, Knueppel is leading Charlotte's offense, with averages of 23.3 points, nine rebounds and 4.8 assists, while shooting 46.3% from the field and 36.8% from deep.          He's initiating Charlotte's offense and developing skills that wouldn't happen if Ball was healthy. It's similar to the development Brandon Miller got in his rookie season when Ball was sidelined for most of the season. In the last few games, Knueppel is showing his ability to score off the dribble, and taking advantage of defenses that underestimate his ability in getting to the rim.          He's making 55% of his mid-range shots, which ranks in the 86th percentile. But his innate ability to use screens to create space is unlike anything we've seen from a rookie. He's navigating these screens like a veteran and sometimes creating an ocean's amount of space to get his shot off.           \nKnueppel's shown more comfortability in putting the ball on the floor and diversifying his shot selection beyond just 3s. That's a valuable asset in his development.\nEdgecombe got out to a blazing start, but has crashed back down to Earth in the last six games. That's to be expected from a rookie, as development is never linear, and the Sixers are integrating some additional pieces back into the rotation who have made Edgecombe adjust. It's not that he's getting fewer touches, he's just struggling to connect on them, whereas the first week and half it felt like he couldn't miss.Span of gamesPPGRPGAPGFG%3P%First 5 games21.25.65.449.4%43.8%Last 6 games10.55.53.331.5%26.9%That doesn't take away from what the former Baylor product has done to this point for the Sixers. He's been better than Philadelphia could've ever hoped he'd be this early on and that's on both ends of the floor. On one end, he's guarding the opposing team's best perimeter player; on the other, he's constantly amazing everyone with the variety of ways in which he can score.\nHe's either knocking down a catch-and-shoot 3-pointer, making everyone hold their breath with what could be an outrageous dunk or getting a defender out on an island in isolation.          The tandem he and Tyrese Maxey create in Philadelphia's backcourt gives them a duo that wreck havoc in transition and gives someone like Joel Embiid a break from having to do everything offensively for this team. Edgecombe's efficiency will even out as the season progresses, so the last batch of games shouldn't be too worrisome.What will be interesting to see is how Paul George figures into all of this, as his return is just around the corner. Edgecombe's already proved himself to be better than just a guy you stick in the corner to shoot 3s, but there's only so many shots and possessions to go around. Someone's going to have to sacrifice and, as crazy at it sounds, it may not be the rookie.\nCoward became the first player in NBA history to average at least 15 points and 50/40/90 shooting splits over their first 10 career games. In his third NBA appearance, he racked up 27 points on nearly 70% from the floor. Every game is evidence to show why the Grizzlies were so desperate to trade up in the draft to nab him with the 11th overall pick.          He shot to the top of boards as a former Division III player before transferring to Washington State last season. It's not surprising that, given Coward's physical attributes (specifically a 7-foot-2 wingspan), he's quickly become a defensive nightmare for opponents. Already he's been tasked with checking Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Kevin Durant, Cade Cunningham, Luka Doncic, Austin Reaves and Devin Booker, to varying levels of success.          For a rookie, he shows no fear when guarding some of the best players in the world and he's also not overly aggressive to the point that he's committing a ton of fouls, which is what you'd expect from a first-year player. No, Coward moves his feet well, doesn't get fazed by the myriad slick crossovers and hesitations that so many of those players have in their bags and he fights over a screen better than most other players -- regardless of experience -- in the league.           And that's just his defense. Offensively, Coward's showing the maturity of his age that comes with most 22-year-old rookies. His 3-point shooting will get the most attention, but it's lower down on the totem pole of what makes his offensive game impressive this early. His off-ball movement, knowing when and at what angle to cut, is levels above what you'd expect from a rookie. His finishing rate at the rim (68%) is something younger players typically struggle with, but that doesn't seem to apply to Coward.          When the Grizzlies traded Desmond Bane to the Orlando Magic, there were questions about who on this roster would fill the production he provided. Coward's proven just 12 games into his career that he's up to the task.          \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Rating transfer portal hauls is an objectively flawed task because players earn a grade before they pick a school, and that decision could make-or-break a newcomer's outlook. You can't control it, but that's the reality. It's just the cost of doing business in the portal era.As part of the portal scouting team, we tried to grade each player objectively based on the data and film on hand, and there were some behind-the-scenes tweaks to the algorithm to reward quality more than quantity. Especially in basketball, landing one five-star transfer (graded 98-100) can be more impactful than three guys who earned a 93 grade, which is smack dab in the middle of the four-star territory.The money is the elephant in the room, too. Now more than ever, every player has a financial slot in the budget. There will be buy-lows that work out swimmingly this season, and there will be some high-priced transfers who don't live up to the billing. Money doesn't guarantee wins, but it sure does not hurt. It's an unfair game right now with over a dozen high-major programs building rosters that cost north of $10 million and others working with scraps, but the overachievers will win in the margins and manage their bankroll best. \n\n        \n            \n                College basketball rankings: Purdue, Alabama clash in top-10 showdown as No. 1 Boilermakers face road test\n                \n                    Gary Parrish                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLet's dive into the early impressions from the top 10-rated 2025 portal hauls, according to 247Sports' algorithm.\n    \n                                        \n    No. 1 St. John'sThe numbers: 1-1, No. 22 on KenPomFor all the consternation about the point guard play at St. John's, offense is not the problem. The Johnnies racked up 1.14 points per possession in Saturday's 103-96 loss to Alabama, turned it over just 12 times and used its freakshow athleticism to get to the foul line 40 times. The fit between Cincinnati transfer Dillon Mitchell and Providence transfer Bryce Hopkins next to forward Zuby Ejiofor has been debated ad nauseam, but the offensive rebounding, transition dominance and overall physicality give it a chance to be totally fine, even though those guys don't take a ton of treys.Right now, it's far more about the point-of-attack defense. Rick Pitino took talented young offensive weapons like Joson Sanon and Ian Jackson, who aren't nearly the defensive hounds as Kadary Richmond or Deivon Smith. Pitino is betting on himself to get 'em to guard, but they weren't up to the challenge against Alabama's electric duo of Aden Holloway and Labaron Philon. St. John's point-of-attack defense is the biggest hot spot right now, but Pitino tends to get this stuff figured out. St. John's will need some time, but I think this portal group could coalesce into a March monster. St. John's size and speed will be overwhelming for a ton of teams in an elimination setting. Early grade: B-\n\n    \n                                        \n    No. 2 MichiganThe numbers: 2-0, No. 15 on KenPomAday Mara -- Michigan's third-highest ranked portal addition -- is an absolute monster in this scheme and maybe Michigan's alpha halfcourt hub already. The 7-3 center poured in 18 points, 13 rebounds, six assists and five blocks in Michigan's come-from-behind, overtime victory over Wake Forest. Elliot Cadeau and Morez Johnson have been totally fine so far, but the jewel of the haul, Yaxel Lendeborg, has been slowed a tad by an injury to his shooting hand. He struggled against Wake Forest, and Michigan's jumbo lineup of Lendeborg-Johnson-Mara wasn't great offensively. I need to see it play more than 30 possessions, preferably when Lendeborg is playing with some fire, to have a strong opinion on its long-term outlook.I am pretty sure Michigan is going to be really, really, really good. The talent on this roster is evident, and all four of the transfers look like hits. Early grade: B\n    \n                                        \n    No. 3 LouisvilleThe numbers: 3-0, No. 9 on KenPomIt remains ludicrous that Isaac McKneely and Ryan Conwell are allowed to be on the same team. That duo combined to splash seven 3-pointers in Louisville's 96-88 win over rival Kentucky, but they're not just sharpshooters. Conwell's sharp cutting and extra rim pressure has helped Louisville's offense have a bit more variety. McKneely has been a sound defender who has embraced a smaller role to let five-star freshmen Mikel Brown Jr. cook. Even without a heavy on-ball role, McKneely is getting his 3s up. He's already taken more transition 3-pointers (eight) in three games at Louisville than he did all of last year at Virginia (six).\nFellow prized portal add Adrian Wooley has been OK in a sixth-man role. He's far more talented than most fourth guards, but the pecking order here is insane. The Cardinals' backcourt has been one of the best in the nation. Grade: A\n    \n                                        \n    No. 4 Kansas StateThe numbers: 2-0, No. 56 on KenPomThe jury is still out on Kansas State, but PJ Haggerty has totaled 50 points and 14 dimes in his first two games. The dude is pretty good at this whole basketball thing, and low-major competition is no match. As presumed, Akron transfer Nate Johnson is an excellent secondary piece. He's a strong defender who makes plays for others, hits the glass and drains open shots. Abdi Bashir (9-for-17 from 3-point range but no free throws and no shots at the rim) is doing what Abdi Bashir does. Kansas State plays Cal on Thursday, and we'll get a bit better pulse of where the 'Cats are actually at. But this portal class should have a pretty high floor, mostly due to Haggerty's brilliance and Johnson's steadiness. Grade: A-\n\n    \n                                        \n    No. 5 KentuckyThe numbers: 2-1, No. 4 on KenPomGetting Jaland Lowe humming will be of utmost priority because the ball just pops a bit differently for Kentucky when he's on the floor. Florida transfer Denzel Aberdeen has been instant offense for the 'Cats so far, averaging a team-high 16 points, and Alabama transfer Mo Dioubate has been serviceable. Kentucky is trotting out a lot of lineups with two bigs who aren't threats to pop a 3-pointer. Ideally, Tulane transfer Kam Williams can start to carve out a bigger role as a jumbo wing/small-ball 4, but he's been doing a ton of cardio so far.The sell for this Kentucky team was that the extra jolt of athleticism would show up the most on the defensive end. Kentucky has guarded at a very high level for stretches, but it also made way too many scouting report errors early in the loss to Louisville, which gave the Cardinals oodles of confidence. I do think defense will be a real strength of this team, with or without talented big man Jayden Quaintance, but they have work to do on both ends. Honestly, Kentucky's most impressive newcomer has been a freshman (Malachi Moreno), not any of these well-paid transfers. Early grade: C-\n    \n                                        \n    No. 6 FloridaThe numbers: 2-1, No. 10 on KenPomFlorida's new guards can't buy a 3-pointer right now. Boogie Fland (2-12) and Xaivian Lee (6-29) are off to chilly starts from downtown, but Florida's offense is generating excellent looks. It feels like only a matter of time until it starts clicking. \nTodd Golden has to like that his new backcourt isn't turning it over (just seven combined giveaways in the first three games for Lee and Fland), but he undoubtedly needs more from them defensively. Lead guards like Arizona's Jaden Bradley and Florida State's Rob McCray V have tormented the Gators in the first eight days of the season. That's a trend to monitor moving forward. Grade: C+\n    \n                                        \n    No. 7 USCThe numbers: 2-0, No. 23 on KenPomSo far, so good for the Muss Bus. USC has rolled to buy-game romps over Manhattan and Cal Poly. High-priced free agents Chad Baker-Mazara and Rodney Rice have been super productive, and USC's rim defense has been so, so much better, as predicted. Toolsy Virginia transfer Jacob Cofie is holding up his end of the bargain, and Eric Musselman's transfer-heavy roster has a bunch of different combinations he can tinker with. I still have some creation questions, but this roster's size jumps off the tape.Ultimately, bigger tests await, but USC's early vision for this roster is starting to materialize. Grade: A\n\n    \n                                        \n    No. 8 IowaThe numbers: 2-0, No. 42 on KenPomBennett Stirtz, uh, looks better. The jumper is even purer, and his burst and explosiveness has ticked up. That's a scary proposition for the Big Ten. Ben McCollum should feel pleased with the jump that Drake transfer Isaia Howard has made. Howard looks the part of a Big Ten rotation player. Although he's coming off the bench, prized Robert Morris transfer Alvaro Folgueiras' talent has also popped in this scheme.It's a bit interesting that Kansas State transfer Brendan Hausen hasn't been a big part of this plan yet. He's operating as the ninth man through two games, but Iowa's flow and connectivity is so obvious. Grade: A-\n    \n                                        \n    No. 9 AuburnThe numbers: 3-0, No. 35 on KenPomKeShawn Murphy is banged up right now, so we haven't seen this new-look Auburn club at the peak of its powers quite yet. But the Keyshawn Hall show is alive and well. The UCF transfer is a flat-out bucket, and Auburn's offense is built around him, not Tahaad Pettiford, right now. \nOverall, you have to feel pretty solid about this Auburn transfer class. Elyjah Freeman has had some eye-popping moments. Texas Tech transfer Kevin Overton is solid. Murphy is going to be an excellent connector, and Hall could lead the SEC in scoring. But will this mercurial group be able to coalesce into a true SEC contender, even if it doesn't have elite rim protection and has more turnover risk in the portfolio? That's a big TBD. We will learn so much on Sunday when the Tigers tangle with Houston. Grade: B\n    \n                                        \n    No. 10 IndianaThe numbers: 3-0, No. 17 on KenPomIndiana has not played a monster frontcourt that could challenge its potentially leaky interior defense yet, but how could you not be impressed by this IU start? Indiana's layered offense is humming with a ton of 3s and even more nifty back-cuts. The Hoosiers have drilled double-digit 3-pointers in three straight games for the first time since 2016-17. Tucker DeVries and Lamar Wilkerson are exceptional flamethrowers, and the additions of set-the-table connectors like Tayton Conerway, Reed Bailey and Conor Enright look like sharp roster-building. This roster has some flaws that will be exposed later, but for now, basketball is fun again in Bloomington. Grade: A+\n            ",

They'll travel to face Angola on Friday, but that's a match which has brought some complications for Lionel Scaloni when it comes to squad selection. To travel to the African nation, there are specific vaccination requirements related to yellow fever that Nahuel Molina, Julian Alvarez, and Giuliano Simeone, all of Atletico Madrid, didn't arrive in time to comply with. Because of that, the trio had to be dropped from the squad, which comes as quite a blow. With Lionel Messi aging, Alvarez has become more important to the Argentina squad by the day and has been in good form for Atletico Madrid with nine goals and four assists in all competitions this season. How to watch Angola vs. Argentina, oddsDate: Friday, Nov. 14 | Time: 11 a.m. ETLocation: Estadio 11 de Novembro -- Luanda, AngolaLive stream: FanatizOdds: Angola +1500; Draw +550; Argentina -650Simeone has also been pushing for more playing time due to his strong form at the club, as he's enjoying a breakout start to the campaign with three goals and five assists in all competitions. With both being able to play in multiple positions, they're important to Scaloni's flexible vision for the squad but also with matches piling up in all competitions, getting some rest isn't the worst thing that could happen.Enzo Fernandez will also miss out on this window due to a bone edema in his right knee. Fernandez's absence has been due to rest to make sure that he's ready to go for the long term. Along with Alexis Mac Allister and Rodrigo De Paul, Fernandez helps make up the engine room of the Argentina squad. His absence may allow for a brotherly connection in the squad as Kevin Mac Allister of Union Saint-Gilloise was called in. The elder of the Mac Allister brothers, he's one of four players in Scaloni's squad who has yet to earn a cap alongside Maximo Perrone, Joaquin Panichelli, and Gianluca Prestianni.\nMixing in new faces each window is one of the main ways that Argentina are able to stay at the top of their game. Even with Messi in the squad, the future of the number 10 may also be there with Como's Nico Paz. Being able to bring in players like him and Valentin Barco early has ensured that even when Argentina have to compete without their stars, there are plenty of players who know the system to push to keep the squad at the top. Looking to win back-to-back World Cups, that integration is critical because simply running it back has the risk of going stale, but Argentina are never content. \n            \n    ",

The Patriots are coming off an impressive 28-23 upset victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, while the Jets defeated the Cleveland Browns, 27-20. The 8-2 Patriots are arguably the hottest team in the NFL, having won seven straight games. One more victory would mark New England's first eight-game winning streak since the Tom Brady era. Like the dynasty of old, the Patriots are powered by a talented defense and a star quarterback. Maye is tied with Matthew Stafford in having the best MVP odds entering Week 11.As for the 2-7 Jets, not much has gone right in Glenn's first season at the helm, but the Jets have won back-to-back games following an 0-7 start. Also New York has won two of the last three meetings with New England, so you never know what could happen in this league and with this rivalry.\nWhere to watch Patriots vs. Jets liveDate: Thursday, Nov. 13 | Time: 8:15 p.m. ETLocation: Gillette Stadium -- Foxborough, MassachusettsStream: PrimeFollow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Patriots -12.5; O/U 43.5 (via FanDuel)Jets vs. Patriots: Need to knowRookies are making an impact. The main headline from New England's win in Tampa was the impact made by first-year players. The Patriots became the first team to have rookies score three 50-yard touchdowns from scrimmage since 1998. TreVeyon Henderson had 55-yard and 69-yard touchdowns, while Kyle Williams caught a 72-yard touchdown pass. Henderson has finally arrived, as he recorded 150 yards from scrimmage.More of that special special teams play. The Jets couldn't have defeated the Browns last week without special teams. They became the first NFL team since 2017 to have a kick return touchdown and punt return touchdown in the same game, and the first team since 2011 to have back-to-back possessions with a kick return touchdown and punt return touchdown. Kene Nwangwu ran back a kick 99 yards for a touchdown in the first quarter, then Isaiah Williams ran back a 74-yard punt return touchdown following a Browns three-and-out. Speaking of special teams, we have to give a shoutout to kicker Nick Folk as well. He's one of two kickers to have not missed a field goal this season, going a perfect 19 of 19. He hasn't missed an extra point yet either. The Jets will need good play from special teams if they want to upset the Patriots. Mike Vrabel's historic start. The former NFL Coach of the Year is tied in having the best 10-game start for a coach who inherited a 13-loss team in NFL history. Andy Reid started 9-2 in his first season with the Kansas City Chiefs, and finished 11-5. Four for IV. The Jets aren't known for their defense, but Will McDonald IV racked up four sacks vs. the Browns last week. He became the first Jet to record four sacks in a game since John Abraham in 2001! No other Jets player has more than 2.5 sacks this season. Jets vs. Patriots prediction, pick\nThere's too much going against the Jets in this matchup. The defense has recorded just one takeaway all season, Justin Fields has thrown fewer than 60 yards in three out of his last four starts and Garrett Wilson is expected to miss a few weeks with his knee injury. I don't believe the Patriots will win this game by 40 points, but I'll take them at -12.5. Pick: Patriots -12.5; Under 43.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Even as Penn State's season has faltered, the running back duo of Kaytron Allen and Nicholas Singleton has been the constant. Two blue-chip recruits who arrived in Happy Valley together in 2022 still stand shoulder to shoulder while climbing the record books in their final season.Playoff hopes are gone and coach James Franklin has moved on, but Kaytron Allen and Nick Singleton have remained models of consistency in an era defined by roster turnover. Together, they've bulldozed through defenses for more than 8,200 scrimmage yards and 88 touchdowns over the past four seasons -- production that already places them among the game's elite backfield duos.With a potential bowl berth still within reach, Allen and Singleton have three games left -- starting Saturday at Michigan State (3:30 p.m. ET on CBS, streaming live on Paramount+ Premium) -- to further cement their legacy.Allen, the bruising workhorse who's been the offense's steadying force, became Penn State's career leader in rushing attempts (697) last week, surpassing Evan Royster's long-standing mark of 686. Now at 3,613 rushing yards, Allen is just 319 away from breaking Royster's all-time program record.\nSingleton, meanwhile, continues to climb toward rarified air despite a down season. His three-touchdown performance against No. 2 Indiana last week brought him to 41 rushing scores and 51 total touchdowns -- within striking distance of Saquon Barkley's career totals (43 rushing, 53 overall). Singleton has also joined Barkley as the only Nittany Lions to record at least 5,000 all-purpose yards and 50 touchdowns, and he's the first Big Ten player to reach those marks since Wisconsin's Jonathan Taylor (2017-19).Their numbers don't just rewrite school history -- they place Allen and Singleton among the most productive backfield tandems in college football to spend at least three seasons together.College football's most productive running back duosNamesSchoolYearsAttemptsRush YardsRush TDsCatchesRec.

Interim coach Terry Smith has made it clear that the duo's workload is central to the Nittany Lions' chances of finally getting back in the win column.Last week against Indiana, the goal was 35 combined touches; they finished with 36.\"This week, we want to be 30-plus opportunities for those two, and if those guys are touching the ball, we've got a great chance at victory,\" Smith said. \"If they're not touching the ball, who knows what the outcome will be.\"Allen has shouldered more of the load this season, totaling 782 yards from scrimmage and 10 touchdowns -- one shy of his career high -- on 152 touches. Singleton's season has been less consistent, with career lows in yards per carry (3.9) and scrimmage yards per game (56.4). But something clicked last week, when he posted season highs with three total touchdowns and 93 yards from scrimmage on 13 touches. He also added 50 yards on two kick returns, flashing the explosiveness that once made him one of the Big Ten's most feared playmakers.\"They're our two best offensive players, and we're going to continue to focus on those guys touching the football,\" Smith said.The last of a dying breed?Allen and Singleton's run isn't just remarkable for the numbers -- it's rare simply because it exists at all. In today's college football landscape, with NIL deals, revenue sharing and an increasingly fluid transfer portal, it's harder than ever to keep two star players of this caliber at the same position on the same roster. Roster management is a balancing act, and sharing carries can now mean splitting paychecks.That's what makes Allen and Singleton such an anomaly. Both could have left -- for bigger roles, brighter spotlights or more lucrative NIL opportunities elsewhere -- but they returned to Happy Valley for one more run. They weren't alone. Quarterback Drew Allar, who suffered a season-ending broken ankle in the loss to Northwestern, and several veteran defenders also came back with a singular goal: to bring Penn State its first national championship since 1986.That dream evaporated by midseason, and the narrative around Penn State shifted from title pursuit to fallout and the firing of the second-winningest coach in program history. Yet Allen and Singleton have quietly anchored a team that seems to have lost its way around them.As college football leans further into money-driven decisions and roster churn, their four-year run together already feels like a relic. The sport isn't built for duos like this anymore.Allen and Singleton may finish without the championship they returned for, but what they've built at Penn State is something different: proof that stability and shared success can still exist, even in a system that makes it nearly impossible.Where to watch Penn State vs. Michigan State liveDate: Saturday, Nov. 15 | Time: 3:30 p.m. ETLocation: Spartan Stadium -- East Lansing, MichiganTV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App, Paramount+ Premium\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 college football bowl schedule begins on Saturday with Boise State vs. Washington (-10). Even with the postseason landscape rapidly changing, college football bowl confidence pools remain popular, and there are 39 matchups to make college football bowl confidence picks on this season. The two biggest spreads are in the CFP First Round as Oregon is favored by 21.5 points over James Madison, while Ole Miss is a 17.5-point favorite over Tulane. While putting faith in big favorites is a part of just about everyone's college football bowl confidence strategy, correctly predicting an upset could help you separate from the pack.Anticipated matchups outside of the CFP include Penn State vs. Clemson (-4.5), Georgia Tech vs. BYU (-4.5), Tennessee vs. Illinois (+4.5) and Michigan vs. Texas (-7.5). The Wolverines will operate under interim head coach Biff Poggi after dismissing Sherrone Moore. The college football odds give you an idea of what sportsbooks deem as favorites and underdogs, but you'll need more than just those when making bowl confidence bets.

Not only is this game in Texas, but it's in Houston, providing the obvious home-field advantage for the Cougars, as LSU has lost its last four games outside of Tiger Stadium. Meanwhile, the Cougars are 5-1 straight-up when favored this season, and the Tigers' offense limps into this matchup as it has a total of four touchdowns over the last four games and won't have quarterback Garrett Nussmeier. That's the same number that Houston had in its last game, alone, as the model has the Cougars winning in 80% of simulations. See all of the model's college football bowl confidence picks here.Another one of the bowl confidence predictions the model is high on: No. 16 USC (-5.5) gets a comfortable win over TCU in the Alamo Bowl on Dec. 30. USC went 9-3 in the regular season, with all three defeats coming versus ranked teams. TCU found itself in the Top 25 once -- back in September -- before having a pedestrian run through the Big 12 schedule, finishing 5-4. Even with the Horned Frogs playing in the easier conference than the Trojans, USC both averaged more points and allowed fewer points per game. USC sports a 32-9 (78%) straight-up record when favored since Lincoln Riley came aboard in 2022, as it is projected to easily take care of business in San Antonio. SportsLine's model has the Trojans prevailing nearly 70% of the time. See the rest of the college football bowl confidence predictions here. How to make college football bowl confidence picksThe model has also made the call on who wins every other bowl game. There are 11 teams that win at least 70% of the time, so you need to go big on those matchups, as well as 15 underdogs that win outright. You can get all the model's picks at SportsLine.So who wins every college football bowl game, and which matchups should you assign the most confidence points to?

    "body": "\n        JuJu Watkins is fulfilling a dream by participating in her first USA Basketball Senior Women's Team camp. \"It was definitely like a pinch-me moment, even all the way back to when I got the invite,\" the USC sophomore said. Unfortunately, participation won't include hitting the court. Watkins is recovering from an ACL tear suffered in the 2025 NCAA Tournament. She announced in September that she would not compete in the 2025-26 season to focus on her rehabilitation and being a good teammate. Now, as a passive participant, Watkins is ready to learn as much as possible and bring those insights to Southern California. \"Honestly, it's enough just kind of being there and feeling the energy ... hearing everybody's voices, the communication, the leadership. I mean, it's just something that you can see and automatically it brings up your standard. So I'll definitely be taking some of those lessons back to SC to kind of continue to grow as a leader and as a player,\" Watkins said. Despite being in recovery, USA Basketball saw value in adding her into the fold. \n\"We wanted her here,\" head coach Kara Lawson told the media Friday afternoon after the first on-court session. Having Watkins, who both Lawson and USA Basketball managing director Sue Bird expect to be part of the future of the program, was a priority. From pre- and post-practice routines to recovery, the young star will have the chance to have a front row seat to the standards and culture. \"I'm hoping that by being around some of the top players in the world that she's getting, maybe through some osmosis, some really good lessons from these veterans,\" Lawson added. \"I think it's great for JuJu, who's obviously incredibly talented,\" Bird said Thursday. \"To get her used to what the national team is, used to being around these players, and then of course, used to being around the coaching staff.\" \nAlthough not how she envisioned her first senior camp, the young USC guard is ecstatic to be there. \"I've dreamt of being a part of this atmosphere. So to see that actually kind of come true, in a sense, and seeing that I'm headed towards the right direction is definitely satisfying,\" Watkins said. Watkins and UCLA center Lauren Betts are the only two NCAA players participating in the December camp. Washington Mystics rookie and former USC Trojan Kiki Iriafen says that speaks volumes to how the two are respected. \"Juju is still in college and she's one of two people that are here on the senior team,\" Iriafen said. \"She's a great spirit and we can't wait for her to be ready and back on the floor.\" \nSitting on the sideline is often seen as a setback, but perhaps this is a chance for Watkins to see the game from a different perspective, especially the habits and discipline required on and off the court when representing Team USA and competing with WNBA players. \"It looks a lot different from what I am used to with college. So for me, it's just kind of getting a feel for, like, what's going to be expected of me at the next level... that definitely helps bring up my I.Q as well,\" Watkins said. \n            ",

For Week 15, let's go with two guys in Travis Etienne and Woody Marks. I expect both to go off in this scoring period.Let's start with Etienne, who is $6,500 on DraftKings and $7,500 on FanDuel. He's facing the Jets, who are No. 3 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing running backs. And in their past four games against the Patriots, Ravens, Falcons, and Dolphins, the Jets have allowed 10 total touchdowns to running backs, and six guys have scored at least 13.5 PPR points. Etienne has scored at least 15.7 PPR points in five of his past six games. He should be dominant in Week 15, and he's a great bargain at his cost.Marks is $5,600 on DraftKings and $6,500 on FanDuel. And he should have a big game against the Cardinals, who are No. 4 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing running backs. In the past five weeks, the backfields for Seattle, San Francisco, Jacksonville, Tampa Bay, and the Rams have combined for 133 carries for 712 yards and eight touchdowns, and 19 catches for 157 yards and two touchdowns on 23 targets. \nOver that span, six running backs have scored at least 14.3 PPR points against Arizona. And Marks just scored 15.6 PPR points in Week 14 at Kansas City.I plan to play both of these running backs in several lineups this week. And I'm expecting both to go off in this scoring period.\nFor more of my DFS plays for Week 15, click on this link to SportsLine.

Harbaugh was asked about the situation during a media appearance Friday. \"Chad Jessop told me, one of our equipment guys, when we were coming off the field on Thursday,\" Harbaugh said. \"So I'm still processing that like a lot of people.\" Harbaugh hired Moore to his Michigan staff in 2018 as tight ends coach. Moore was promoted to co-offensive coordinator in 2021 and assumed sole play-calling responsibilities in 2023. Moore also served as Michigan's acting head coach for one game during the 2023 season after Harbaugh was suspended for three games following the Big Ten's investigation into Michigan's sign-stealing scandal. Harbaugh and Moore guided Michigan to a 15-0 record in 2023, capped by a win against Washington in the College Football Playoff National Championship. Michigan tabbed Moore as Harbaugh's successor when Harbaugh made his return to the NFL with the Chargers ahead of the 2024 campaign. \nIn two seasons as Michigan's coach, Moore amassed a 15-8 record. He was suspended for two games in 2025 after the university self-imposed a penalty for Moore's role in the sign-stealing scheme. The 39-year-old Moore was fired for cause on Dec. 10. Athletic director Warde Manuel confirmed Moore's termination was the result of Moore's \"inappropriate relationship with a staff member.\"Moore was arrested shortly after his firing and, on Friday, was handed three charges, including felony home invasion, by the Washtenaw County (Mich.) Prosecutor's Office. He is accused of \"unlawfully entering the victim's residence to commit the crime of stalking and committing that crime while in the residence.\" \nHe was also charged with stalking and breaking and entering or entering without breaking, which are both misdemeanors. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        We continue to work our way through a limited schedule this week because of the NBA Cup. While all eyes might be on the semifinals on Saturday, fantasy managers are scouring the waiver wire for players who can help their teams. Here are five players to consider adding who are still available in the majority of CBS leagues.Kyle Filipowski, Utah Jazz (50% rostered)Filipowski is averaging a modest 23 minutes per game for the season. Still, he has been fantasy relevant with averages of 9.6 points, 6.4 rebounds, 2.5 assists, and one 3-pointer. He has seen more playing time lately, logging at least 29 minutes across his last five games, two of which were starts. During that span, he provided 14 points, 8.2 rebounds, 3.4 assists, 1.4 steals, and 1.2 3-pointers a night.The Jazz are well on their way to another season of missing out on the playoffs. As they continue to rack up losses, it would not be a surprise if veteran Jusuf Nurkic is traded or takes a back seat to Filipowski. There is also the potential for a Lauri Markkanen trade. Over 28 games after the All-Star break last season, Filipowski averaged 14.3 points, 8.1 rebounds, 2.3 assists, and 1.7 3-pointers. As his role looks to be expanding, adding him now could pay off in the long run.Herbert Jones, New Orleans Pelicans (38% rostered)Jones recently missed eight straight games with a calf strain. He started and played 26 minutes in his return Monday, then logged 14 minutes in a start against the Trail Blazers on Thursday before being ejected. Even with the emergence of Derik Queen and Saddiq Bey, Jones should play around 30 minutes on a nightly basis, especially with Zion Williamson (adductor) currently out.\nEven with ample playing time, Jones isn't likely to provide a ton of scoring. The reason to roster him in fantasy is because of his ability to rack up steals. He has averaged 1.5 steals per game this season and has never finished a season averaging fewer than 1.4 steals. For those hunting for help in the category, there may be no better player to add off the waiver wire than Jones.Maxime Raynaud, Sacramento Kings (37% rostered)The Kings continue to play without Domantas Sabonis, who is working his way through a partially torn meniscus. They initially turned to Drew Eubanks to replace Sabonis in the starting lineup, but that experiment didn't last long. A much more productive option has been Raynaud, who has played at least 22 minutes in each of the last six games.With Raynaud receiving additional opportunities, he has averaged 15.5 points, 7.2 rebounds, 1.8 assists, and 0.8 blocks over that six-game span. The rookie is not only shooting 52.7% from the field this season, but he has also made 75.9% of his attempts from the charity stripe. The Kings tend to make some weird lineup decisions, but with how well he is playing and their lack of options with Sabonis out, it would be a surprise if Raynaud doesn't remain in his new role.\nDaniel Gafford, Dallas Mavericks (31% rostered)Gafford is currently battling an ankle injury. After injuries limited him to 57 games last season, Gafford has appeared in just 15 games this season. When he has played, he has been underwhelming with averages of 8.9 points and 6.4 rebounds, although he has averaged 1.4 blocks and shot 61% from the field.None of the above seems to be making a case for adding Gafford. However, the Mavericks delivered the news Wednesday that Dereck Lively II (foot) is set to undergo season-ending surgery. Anthony Davis has expressed multiple times that he prefers not to play center, so the Lively injury could provide a boost for Gafford for the remainder of the season. Once Gafford gets through his current ankle issue, he has a path to play around 20-25 minutes a game.Marcus Smart, Los Angeles Lakers (9% rostered)Smart recently missed six games with a back injury. He returned in grand fashion Wednesday, scoring 26 points over 28 minutes off the bench against the Spurs. Smart took a whopping 14 three-point attempts, making eight of them. While bouncing in and out of the starting lineup, the veteran has averaged 27 minutes in his first season with the Lakers.\nSmart's overall averages of 10.4 points, 2.3 rebounds, and 2.8 assists through 15 games are nothing to write home about. However, that doesn't mean he's not a viable fantasy option in deeper formats. He is also averaging 1.6 three-pointers and 1.7 steals. Prior to last season's disastrous stints with the Grizzlies and Wizards, Smart had averaged at least 1.6 3-pointers and 1.5 steals in five straight seasons. The Lakers don't have a ton of quality depth, so there should be enough minutes available for Smart to help fantasy managers in both departments again.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Angel Reese is taking part in training camp with USA Basketball this weekend, and during her media session on Friday she stated that she will remain with the Chicago Sky despite a tumultuous end to the 2025 WNBA season. \"I'm under contract, so yes, I plan on returning to the Sky,\" Reese told reporters during her first interview since September. \"I'm continuing to talk to Tyler and building that relationship with Jeff and Tyler,\" she added, referring to Sky head coach Tyler Marsh and general manager Jeff Pagliocca. Reese is under contract through 2027, when the Sky have a team option, but there has been plenty of speculation about her future. The two-time All-Star did not play in the team's final four games due to a combination of injury and suspensions (both team and league issued), and gave a controversial interview to the Chicago Tribune, in which she aired her frustrations with the front office, coaching staff and roster construction, and called for major moves in free agency. \n\"I'm not settling for the same shit we did this year,\" Reese said. \"We have to get good players. We have to get great players. That's a non-negotiable for me.\"I'm willing and wanting to play with the best. And however I can help to get the best here, that's what I'm going to do this offseason. So it's going to be very, very important this offseason to make sure we attract the best of the best because we can't settle for what we have this year.\"Reese also made comments about specific players, and at one point expressed concern about Courtney Vandersloot's age. \n\"We can't rely on Courtney to come back at the age that she's at,\" Reese said. \"I know she'll be a great asset for us, but we can't rely on that. We need someone probably a little younger with some experience, somebody who's been playing the game and is willing to compete for a championship and has done it before.\"\n        \n            \n                Sky fall: How Angel Reese has been pushed to her limit in two seasons and what's next in Chicago\n                \n                    Lindsay Gibbs                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nVandersloot responded publicly, saying her \"age is absolutely not a factor\" and stated her plan to return to the Sky in 2026. Reese later apologized, both privately and publicly, to her teammates and said her comments were \"taken out of context.\" The organization eventually suspended Reese for the first half of the team's game against the Las Vegas Aces on Sept. 7; she had already been suspended by the league for the game on Sept. 5 against the Indiana Fever for accumulating too many technical fouls. \nReese sat out of the second half on Sept. 7 due to a back injury and missed the team's final two games of the season due to the issue. She later opted out of her exit interview, as did Vandersloot and Ariel Atkins. \"I am very vocal about what we need and what I want,\" Reese said in her interview with the Tribune. \"I'd like to be here for my career, but if things don't pan out, obviously I might have to move in a different direction and do what's best for me.\"While that comment inititally seemed like a nod at leaving in free agency one day, the events that transpired after the interview led many to wonder if she would request a trade this offseason. Reese made it clear Friday that she will not force her way out of town. \n\n        \n            \n                Chicago Sky offseason outlook: What's next for Angel Reese and Co. after a disastrous 2025 campaign\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThat's great news for the Sky, who are trying to forge a path forward after a disastrous 2025 season. Despite making a number of win-now moves -- most notably, trading the No. 3 pick (Sonia Citron) and a 2027 first-round swap to the Washington Mystics for Atkins -- the Sky went 10-34, tied the single-season losses record and missed the playoffs for the second season in a row. The Sky have the No. 5 pick in the 2026 WNBA Draft and, like every team, will have plenty of cap and roster space to make moves this offseason once a new collective bargaining agreement is in place. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Caitlin Clark spoke to reporters Friday at Duke University during USA Basketball training camp and made a plea for compromise in the labor battle between the WNBA and the players, which has been raging for months as the two sides try to come to terms on a new collective bargaining agreement. Clark called this the \"biggest moment the WNBA has ever seen,\" and added that while the players are going to \"fight for everything we deserve,\" they \"need to play basketball.\" The WNBA and the Women's National Basketball Players Association recently agreed to a 40-day extension on the current CBA -- the second extension since the 2025 season came to a close -- which pushed the new expiration date to Jan. 9, 2026. \n        \n            \n                WNBA CBA negotiations: New league offer boosts salaries but disrupts March Madness and cuts housing benefits\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThere has been movement in recent weeks. Notably, the WNBA offered a proposal with a significant increase in pay -- base max contract above $1 million, average salary above $500,00 and minimum salary above $225,000 -- and a form of revenue sharing. However, the league also suggested a possible mid-March starting date for training camp and eliminating housing subsidies for the players. \nA deal does not appear imminent, and the clock is ticking to ensure the 2026 season starts on time. Already, the offseason has been disrupted. The Golden State Valkyries held their expansion draft on Dec. 6 last year; it's unclear when the Toronto Tempo and Portland Fire will be able to do the same. As negotiations continue, here are Clark's full comments from Friday:\"This is the biggest moment the WNBA has ever seen. It's not something that can be messed up. We're going to fight for everything we deserve, but at the same time we need to play basketball. That's what our fans crave and that's what all of you crave as well. You want the product on the floor. At the end of the day that's how you make the money, that's how you're marketable, that's what the fans get excited about, that's what the fans want to show up for. \"It's business and it's a negotiation and there has to be compromise on both sides. We're starting to get down to the wire of it, and it's become really important. Obviously, I want to help in any way I can, and I've tried to educate myself the best I can. And obviously, I can't speak to every single number, it's pretty complicated, but I think there are different things that we can find ways to say, 'no, we certainly deserve that and we're not going to compromise on that,' and then other things that we can probably compromise on.\"Like I said, this is the biggest moment in the history of the WNBA, and I don't want that to be forgotten. It's important that we find a way to play this next season. I think our fans, even everybody that has played in this league and come before us deserve that as well.\"Clark pledges loyalty to WNBAAs the WNBA's CBA standoff continues, there have been plenty of questions about other leagues, including Unrivaled and Athletes Unlimited. No other venture has generated more headlines, however, than the newly created Project B, which plans to launch in the fall of 2026. The ambitious new league, which will play in a number of locations in Europe and Asia, is offering seven-figure salaries and has already signed a number of WNBA stars, including WNBPA president Nneka Ogwumike, Alyssa Thomas, Jewell Loyd, Jonquel Jones and Kelsey Mitchell. Another of Clark's Fever teammates, Sophie Cunningham, has also signed, and said recently on her podcast that she tried to recruit Clark to join, but was rebuffed. Asked Friday about Project B, Clark pledged her loyalty to the WNBA. \"I plan to play in the WNBA,\" Clark said. \"Obviously that's another thing we need to get done so we have a season coming up here.\"Clark did, however, praise the fact that there are more options than ever for women's basketball players. \n\"I think more than anything, it showcases what people think of women's basketball. All of these different opportunities, all of these different leagues, the platform that they want to give women's basketball, where they think women's basketball is gonna continue to grow. I think that's probably the thing that pops into my mind is just that -- when people are really believing and putting their money where their mouth is,\" Clark said. \"That hasn't always been the case for women's basketball, no matter how great it's been over the course of the last 25-30 years. I think for myself, I think that's what I'm most proud of is how excited people are to want to invest and support women's basketball more than anything.\"Clark says she's 'back to 100%'Clark's sophomore season in the WNBA was a disaster. She only appeared in 13 games due to an array of lower body injuries -- left quad, left groin, right groin and left ankle -- and didn't play after July 15. When she was on the floor, she rarely looked like herself, and shot 36.7% from the field, including 27.9% from 3-point range.During her exit interview after the Fever were eliminated from the playoffs, Clark noted that her goal was to be healthy and compete for Team USA during the offseason, and she said Friday that it \"feels nice to finally be back to 100%.\" While she admitted that it \"took probably longer than I expected,\" she's happy to know her body is \"in a really good spot.\"Now, she can finally focus solely on her game instead of rehab. \n\"Honestly I feel like when I touched the basketball to start warming up before the practice even started, that's probably when I felt pretty comfortable,\" Clark said. \"I worked so hard, like I haven't taken a break since the beginning of the WNBA season with all my rehab, getting back to where I wanted to be and getting even better. That's been my focus. This has been my next thing I've been working for since our season ended. \"For myself, it's not proving it to yourself again, it's just that feeling. It just made me smile quite a bit. I really did feel like myself out there, and just continuing to get my lungs back, but I felt like I was moving really well, so it was pretty satisfying.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Victor Wembanyama is expected to return Saturday night for the NBA Cup semifinals against the Thunder after nearly a month absence due to a calf strain, according to ESPN's Shams Charania. That's a huge boost for a Spurs team that has managed to stay afloat without their franchise superstar, and is expected to have major reinforcements as it takes on the nearly unbeatable Thunder.Spurs coach Mitch Johnson hinted at Wembanyama making a return on Saturday when talking to reporters on Wednesday.\"Very much so,\" Johnson said on the possibility of Wembanyama returning on Saturday. \"He had a very good day today. He had a good intent day this morning and we'll have to see how he responds and reacts tomorrow.\"Final clearance will come after the Spurs practice on Friday, according to the report, and as long as everything goes well, all signs are pointing towards him making his return on Saturday. Wembanyama reportedly wanted to return Wednesday against the Lakers in the NBA Cup quarterfinals, but both he and the Spurs felt it was best to get him some more rest and rehab time for a return on Saturday.\nWembanyama sustained a calf strain on Nov. 14, and while it could've spelled disaster for the Spurs, the team managed to go 9-3 in his absence. They're still fifth in the Western Conference despite Wembanyama's injury, and now return someone who was off to an MVP-level start to the season. Through the first 12 games of the season, Wembanyama was averaging 26.2 points, 12.9 rebounds, four assists, 3.6 blocks and 1.1 steals a game. He was considered an early frontrunner for both MVP and Defensive Player of the Year, but now that he's missed 12 games, it puts his eligibility for those awards, as well as All-NBA in jeopardy given the league's 65-game minimum rule.Wembanyama can only miss five more games this season to remain eligible, which may be difficult for the Spurs to manage with 58 games left on their schedule. But personal achievements aside, gaining Wembanyama makes the Spurs an even more formidable threat, and we've already seen that this team is capable of putting together wins without him.\nThe continual development of Stephon Castle, as well as De'Aaron Fox's resurgence in Wembanyama's absence has helped San Antonio keep its footing in a competitive conference. With Wemby back, it will be interesting to see how much more of a threat the Spurs can be. For his first game to come against the Thunder will be a perfect challenge so San Antonio can see how far apart they are from the reigning champions.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        For at least one day, Liverpool were able to look past their turmoil after defeating Inter 1-0 in Champions League play on Tuesday. Fans chanting Arne Slot's name showed a shift from backing Mohamed Salah in his current power struggle to supporting the manager who is tasked with leading the Reds through this rough patch in their form. They've shown glimpses in the Champions League, but sitting 10th in the Premier League behind rivals Everton and a newly promoted Sunderland, this hasn't followed the Reds into the Premier League.How to watch Liverpool vs. Brighton, oddsDate: Saturday, Dec. 13 | Time: 10 a.m. ETLocation: Anfield -- Liverpool, EnglandLive stream: PeacockOdds: Liverpool -150; Draw +320; Brighton +370As the team returns to domestic play on Saturday, focus shifts back to Salah as this could be his final game for Liverpool, and there's no guarantee that he'll even feature. Salah will be released for the Africa Cup of Nations to compete with Egypt on Dec. 15, following this match facing Brighton, and with a run that could take him to Jan. 18 if Egypt makes it to the final of the competition, the transfer window could be wide open upon his return.Slot didn't offer much clarity as to whether Salah would get to make an appearance against Brighton, but that also does make sense as this is a developing situation by the hour, let alone the day.\"Salah in our out against Brighton? I will speak to Mo in the next few hours, and this conversation will determine all next steps,\" Slot said in his prematch press conference before facing Brighton.While it's hard to see a way back for Salah after he went on record stating that someone at the club wants to push him out and that he's been thrown under the bus, it's also true that Liverpool wouldn't have many suitors for the Egyptian star in January. According to the Athletic, those discussions were positive and will see Salah return to the Liverpool squad for facing Brighton before departing for AFCON.\nConsidering potential transfers, if San Diego FC can't enter the picture, it could be a trip to the Saudi Pro League or bust for Salah. It'd be a tall task for another European side to meet Salah's salary demands, but there's also the case that Liverpool would want a transfer fee for Salah. With the 33-year-old on the wrong side of the aging curve and only having five goals and three assists all season while failing to register a goal contribution in seven consecutive matches, it's hard to see why someone would see that and decide to roll the Brinks truck up to Anfield to secure his signature -- not to mention that Salah put all his cards on the table, far from the best transfer strategy.Liverpool were going to need to eventually think about life without Salah, but it wasn't something that was the plan one year removed from winning the title; however, this season does provide them with an opportunity to plan for that. Even if Salah doesn't depart in January, Liverpool are already 10 points off the pace of Arsenal atop the league, the title race may not be over for Liverpool, but this is also a time when their best opportunities for silverware will come in the Champions League and cups.Knocking off Inter and Real Madrid in European play, there's no reason that Liverpool can't win the Champions League despite their domestic struggles. The Premier League can be a ground for figuring out what the best configuration is to do that as while they'll want to get back into a European place in the table, even with rotation, there's enough talent in the squad to do it. The Inter win saw Hugo Ekitike and Alexander Isak lead the line together, and more experimentation will be needed. \nLast season, Salah running hot and scoring 29 goals and assisting 18 more was enough to lead Liverpool to the title, but with that form out of the equation, Slot has a big question to answer on how to replace them. The expectation was that Isak would continue his own Premier League form after consecutive seasons of scoring 20 or more goals with Newcastle United but it has actually been Ekitike who has been the more effective of the forwards with seven goals and two assists in all competitions. It's far too early to say that Isak won't be a good fit at Liverpool, but the time is now for Slot to figure out how to get the best out of the Swedish striker.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        In an attempt to solve their goaltending woes, the Edmonton Oilers acquired Tristan Jarry from the Pittsburgh Penguins Friday while sending the much-maligned Stuart Skinner the other way. Edmonton needed to make a move in goal, but is Jarry really the answer?The Oilers added Jarry and young forward Samuel Poulin from the Penguins in exchange for Skinner, veteran defenseman Brett Kulak and a 2029 second-round pick. To make up for the loss of Kulak, Edmonton sent a 2027 third-round pick to the Nashville Predators for 25-year-old defenseman Spencer Stastney.\n        \n            \n                NHL Power Rankings: Stars, Avalanche on collision course for heavyweight bout in West\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIt's easy to see why Oilers general manager Stan Bowman felt compelled to make a deal for another goaltender. Edmonton is 30th in the league with a team save percentage of .873, and its original tandem of Skinner and Calvin Pickard combined to allow 15.6 goals saved above average, per Natural Stat Trick.That said, it's hard to see Jarry solving the Oilers' goaltender issues, which have persisted throughout most of Connor McDavid's career. Jarry is off to a good start in 2025-26, but his track record has plenty of red flags and Edmonton shipped off a second-round pick without getting any salary retention.\nThis trade is a lateral move and another example of the Oilers' lack of imagination when it comes to building a true contender around McDavid and Leon Drasaitl.Is Tristan Jarry an upgrade over Stuart Skinner?Through the first two months of the season, there is no question that Jarry has been better than Skinner. Jarry has posted a .909 save percentage to go along with 4.40 goals saved above average and a sparkling .880 high-danger save percentage.Skinner, on the other hand, has floundered with the rest of the Oilers. He's flailed his way to an .891 save percentage, 3.85 goals allowed above average and a .771 high-danger save percentage.\nOn those grounds, this deal for Jarry makes plenty of sense, but the problem here is that goaltending is highly volatile. Even bad goalies can look good for 14 appearances and vice versa. That's why you have to look at the longer track record, and that's where this deal starts to sour for Edmonton.In the two seasons spanning from 2023-25, Skinner has outplayed Jarry. In January of this year, Jarry was placed on waivers because of his poor performance. All 31 other teams had the chance to claim him, including the Oilers, and none did.Here's a comparison of Jarry and Skinner over the previous two seasons with data from Natural Stat Trick:\nTristan JarryStuart SkinnerGames87110Sv%.898.901High-danger Sv%.782.797GSAA-7.94-1.15That's a much larger sample size than the 14 games Jarry has played this season, and it's cause for concern if you're an Oilers fan. To make matters worse, Jarry doesn't exactly have a stellar playoff resume, albeit in a small sample size.In his eight postseason appearances, Jarry has posted an .891 save percentage and a 3.00 GAA. Both of those numbers are worse than Skinner's, and the former Edmonton netminder has 50 postseason games under his belt.The hope for Edmonton is that Jarry continues his strong start in a new locale, but he hasn't been able to sustain a high level of play for a while now.Oilers falling behind in the WestDespite possessing two of the top five players in the world, the Oilers find themselves at 14-11-6 and clinging to a wild card spot in the Western Conference. With McDavid and Leon Draisaitl in the prime of their careers, Edmonton should be a juggernaut alongside the Colorado Avalanche and Dallas Stars. Instead, the team is just trying to scrape by for now.That's due in part to the fact that Oilers management has been content to tinker around the edges while other contenders have made big-time moves that push the needle in their favor.Just look at some of the more significant moves Edmonton has made over the last few years. Prior to the 2024-25 season, the Oilers let two promising young players (and restricted free agents) walk out the door in Dylan Holloway and Philip Broberg. That same offseason, Edmonton brought in aging forwards Jeff Skinner and Viktor Arvidsson to bolster its top six. Those moves backfired almost immediately.In 2023-24, the Oilers landed veteran Adam Henrique from the Anaheim Ducks in a trade. At the time, Henrique seemed like he could give Edmonton valuable depth down the middle. Instead, Henrique has totaled just 20 goals and 25 assists in 134 games with the team.The Oilers' inability to fix their goaltending issues might be the biggest condemnation of the front office. Since the start of the 2021-22 season, Edmonton has rolled out Mike Smith, Mikko Koskinen, Jack Campbell, Skinner, Pickard and now Jarry. Each move has been -- at best -- lateral with no goalie providing reliability when it matters most.Now compare the Oilers to teams like the Florida Panthers, Vegas Golden Knights, Tampa Bay Lightning, Avalanche and Stars. When a true impact player becomes available, those teams will move heaven and Earth if they think that player can get them over the hump. That includes letting franchise stars who are past their prime walk in free agency, trading productive roster players and forking over one future asset after another.McDavid signed a short two-year extension at the start of this season, so Edmonton is only guaranteed to have him through 2027-28. That should create some urgency for the Oilers in their quest to build a Cup champion, but the acquisition for Jarry might be another single while other contenders swing for the fences.\n            ",

    "body": "\nCade Cunningham is undoubtedly the cheese that tops the Detroit Pistons' pizza, but have you seen what Jalen Duren has done this season? The 22-year-old specimen has had a breakout season, averaging a career-high in scoring (18.8 points per game) while emerging as a potential NBA All-Star. He's a large (6-foot-10, 250 pounds to be exact) reason why the Pistons (19-5) own the best record in the Eastern Conference and second-best record in the entire league.If you haven't seen Duren yet this season, you'll get a chance on Friday when he and Detroit take on the Atlanta Hawks at Little Caesars Arena in Detroit.Duren's success shouldn't be a surprise; he has displayed freaky athleticism for years. Behind Duren and Cunningham, the Pistons rank fourth in the NBA in defensive rating (111.3). On Friday, they will square off against a Hawks team they've already beaten twice in two meetings this season. Atlanta has lost three of its last four games but is coming off a 15-point win at the Wizards.Detroit is a 7.5-point favorite against the Hawks.While Pistons vs. Hawks is the marquee attraction on Friday, there are other options on a sporting landscape that includes seven NBA matchups and 13 college basketball games. Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Friday, Dec. 12. All times Eastern.NBA best bets, where to watchHawks at PistonsTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Detroit | TV: NBA TV | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Hawks +234\nWhile Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Nikola Jokic are the leading candidates for the NBA MVP award, Cunningham certainly is making a case to be considered. He ranks second in the league in assists per game (9.3) and 11th in points per game (27.5) while also averaging 6.4 rebounds a game for the top team in the East. In the two previous matchups against the Hawks this season, he has averaged 21.5 points, 9.0 assists and 7.0 rebounds. Meanwhile, Atlanta may have found something offensively over the last week. In two games against the Nuggets and Warriors, the Hawks had an offensive rating of 127.5, which ranks fourth in the league over that time. The SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every game 10,000 times, says Atlanta has a 40% chance to win and assigns a moderate B grade to Hawks money line (+234).Timberwolves at WarriorsTime: 10 p.m. | Location: San Francisco | TV: NBA TV | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Over 230.5 | Expert: Warriors -120 (Matt Severance)\nSplash Brother Steph Curry is on track to return on Friday after missing the last five games with a left quad contusion and muscle strain. Meanwhile, Timberwolves guard Anthony Edwards is listed as questionable because of right foot soreness, and if he can't go, that would obviously be a significant absence for Minnesota. Over his last 10 games, Edwards is averaging 31.4 points per game (while shooting 53.0% from the field), which ranks fourth in the league over that time, behind only Luka Doncic, Gilgeous-Alexander and Jokic. \"If he sits, then I believe this for sure cashes,\" Severance says. Meanwhile, the SportsLine Projection Model says there's a 55.2% chance the teams combine for 231 points or more and gives a B grade to Over 230.5.College basketball best bets, where to watchMissouri State at XavierTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Cincinnati | TV: truTV | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Missouri State +17.5 | Expert: Xavier -18.5 (Bruce Marshall)\nTre Carroll and the Xavier Musketeers are on a bit of a roll. The Musketeers (7-3) have won four in a row and five of their last six, with the one loss being a one-point defeat to Georgia. Meanwhile, over the last two games Carroll averaged 25.5 points, 6.5 rebounds and 2.5 assists in ‍wins over Cincinnati and Saint Francis. The performances earned him the Big East Player of the Week award. Meanwhile, Missouri State coach Cuonzo Martin and the Bears (4-4) have struggled recently, losing four of their last six games. Marshall notes that Missouri State has lost its two road games this season by an average of 21.0 points a game. \"Cuonzo's team also isn't helping itself with subpar 29.7% shooting beyond the arc,\" he says. However, the SportsLine Projection Model says the Bears have a 52% chance to cover and assigns a C grade to Missouri State +17.5.Texas at No. 5 ConnecticutTime: 8 p.m. | Location: Hartford | TV: FOX | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Over 145.5 | Expert: Texas +13.5 (Chip Patterson)\nThe fifth-ranked UConn Huskies (9-1) face a familiar foe on Friday when they take on Sean Miller and the Texas Longhorns (7-3). Over the last three seasons, the Huskies faced Miller seven times when he was the head coach at Xavier. The Huskies went 4-3 against Miller and the Musketeers. (Connecticut lost just 19 times in its other 107 games.) Patterson notes the Huskies could be set up for a letdown after pulling out a 77-73 victory over defending national champion Florida on Tuesday at Madison Square Garden. \"This spread considers Texas way too much of a pushover given the spot and the familiarity in the coaching matchup,\" Patterson says. Meanwhile, the SportsLine Projection Model says there's a 68.9% chance the teams combine for 146 points or more and gives a B grade to Over 145.5.Looking aheadCollege football: Army vs. NavyTime: 3 p.m. Saturday | Location: Baltimore | TV: CBS | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Over 38.5  | Expert: Over 38.5 (Mike Tierney)\nJoe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak. UCLA's seven straight men's basketball titles. And ... the Under hitting 16 straight times in the Army Navy game from 2006-21? Certainly to sports bettors, the Army-Navy Under run ranks as one of the greatest streaks in sports history. But the Over has hit in two of the last three years, including last year when the teams combined for 44 points. This year, Navy (9-2) owns the 31st-best scoring offense in the country (32.5 points per game) while Army (6-5) is 99th at 23.0. Tierney also notes that Army has picked up the pace on offense, ranking 67th in snaps per game. \"Unless the coaches go scared conservative on play-calling, this matchup should easily find the 40s in points,\" he says. The SportsLine Projection Model agrees. It says the teams combine for 39 points or more and assigns a B grade to Over 38.5.\n            ",

With Smith out, Kenny Pickett will start against the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday. Pickett was the backup to Jalen Hurts for the Eagles last season when they won the Super Bowl. \"He's (Pickett) done everything we could ask of him,\" Carroll said Friday. \"He had an excellent week. He's in command of what we're doing. Communications are good and all that. Got a little East Coast in him, so that won't hurt.\"Smith departed from the Week 14 loss after a hit to his shoulder at the end of the third quarter. Carroll said after the game that his shoulder \"locked up\" and that tests did not reveal any structural damage. Smith was 13 for 21 for 116 yards and a touchdown when he headed to the locker room. Pickett entered in relief and completed eight of 11 passes for 97 yards and a score of his own.Despite Pickett's effectiveness in the fourth quarter and Smith's season-long struggles, Carroll said after the Denver loss that he intends to start Smith moving forward if he is available. Carroll said Friday there's a strong chance Smith will be healthy in time for Week 16. \n\n        \n            \n                Raiders vs. Eagles prediction: Las Vegas battles, but Philadelphia bounces back to end losing streak\n                \n                    Bryan DeArdo                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSmith's arrival in Las Vegas ahead of the 2025 season was a source of optimism, as his familiarity with Carroll and his promising young supporting cast indicated the potential for a strong debut campaign with his new team. Instead, this year has been a disastrous one for the NFL's lowest-scoring offense.Only six teams passed for fewer yards through Week 14, and Smith's 14 interceptions are the most of any quarterback. The result is a 2-11 record which places the Raiders at the bottom of the AFC standings.\nWith Pickett stepping into the starting lineup against the Eagles, it will be his fourth appearance and first start of the year. Pickett spent 2024 in Philadelphia and started one game -- a 41-7 win over the Dallas Cowboys. The former first-round pick opened his career with the Pittsburgh Steelers but did not catch on as a starter with any of his three teams and has 16 career touchdowns to 14 interceptions.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Catcher took a big leap in 2025, with Hunter Goodman, Ben Rice, Agustin Ramirez and Drake Baldwin all emerging as impact bats at the position and Kyle Teel making his presence known as well. But that's not the end of it. Samuel Basallo barely got his feet wet at the end of the year. Same for Carter Jensen. They rank as the top two in a catcher class that remains loaded with offensive talent, even with the recent influx we've seen in the majors. 2026 Prospects: C | 1B | 2B | 3B | SS | OF | P  Some of it's still far away, and the assurances run out before we arrive at the 10th name on the list. But that should go without saying at catcher, a position where playing time can be unpredictable and not every prospect goes on to meet the high defensive threshold. I would guess at least three of these catchers don't actually end up as catchers. But the bottom line is that there's still plenty to look forward to at this position even with the embarrassment of riches in the majors. \nNote: These rankings are intended mainly for Dynasty use, emphasizing long-term value over a quick payoff, but to say proximity holds no weight wouldn't be entirely accurate either. Not all of these players will contribute in 2026 — most, in fact, will not — but among prospects, they're the names Fantasy Baseballers most need to know.  1. Samuel Basallo, Orioles  Age (on opening day): 21 Where he played in 2025: Triple-A, majors Minor league stats: .270 BA (270 AB), 23 HR, .966 OPS, 44 BB, 76 K Major league stats: .165 BA (109 AB), 4 HR, .559 OPS, 6 BB, 30 K Though a masher of the highest standing in the minors, Basallo failed to capitalize on a late-season injury to Adley Rutschman, continuing the Orioles' recent trend of high-profile prospect disappointments. The sample was too small to take at face value, though, and the expectation is that he'll enter spring training with the inside track at either first base or DH, making him an early Rookie of the Year favorite. \n 2. Carter Jensen, Royals Age (on opening day): 22 Where he played in 2025: Double-A, Triple-A, majors Minor league stats: .290 BA (427 AB), 20 HR, 10 SB, .878 OPS, 60 BB, 122 K Major league stats: .300 BA (60 AB), 3 HR, .941 OPS, 9 BB, 12 K Jensen had the major league debut Basallo was supposed to, forcing his way into an everyday role with a 95.4 mph average exit velocity and the top-line production to match. It was a clarifying performance for a player who caught some evaluators by surprise -- a seamless continuation of his minor league breakthrough -- and it might lead to Salvador Perez spending most of his time at DH this year.  3. Josue Briceno, Tigers Age (on opening day): 21 Where he played in 2025: High-A, Double-A Minor league stats: .266 BA (364 AB), 20 HR, .883 OPS, 66 BB, 87 K \nBriceno's MVP performance in the Arizona Fall League a year ago indeed carried over to regular season play at High-A, where he slashed .296/.422/.602 in 55 games. His production slipped with a midseason move up to Double-A, but he was still only 20 at the time and sustained his strong plate discipline and exit velocity readings. Rarely these days are catchers as tall as he is, but to use an old trope, the bat will play anywhere.4. Rainiel Rodriguez, Cardinals Age (on opening day): 19 Where he played in 2025: Rookie, Low-A, High-A Minor league stats: .276 BA (301 AB), 20 HR, .954 OPS, 54 BB, 65 K Given    what he's already accomplished at age 18 -- climbing all the way to    High-A with strike-zone judgment beyond his years, a swing that's    optimized for power, and exit velocities as high as 111 mph -- it's not    hard to imagine Rodriguez claiming the top spot on this list as early   as  next year. He may have trouble finding a defensive  home if he   doesn't stick as a catcher, which is a legitimate question  with Ivan Herrera, Leonardo Bernal and Jimmy Crooks also up and coming for the Cardinals. \n5. Alfredo Duno, Reds Age (on opening day): 20   Where he played in 2025: Low-A   Minor league stats: .287 BA (390 AB), 18 HR, .948 OPS, 95 BB, 91 K There's a case for ranking Duno ahead of Briceno given that he's already producing major league-caliber exit velocities as a 19-year-old and slashed .316/.456/.632 over his final 40 games, but Briceno was putting up similar numbers a step higher on the minor-league ladder. It's true that Duno is the more likely of the two to stick at catcher, but that's not always the best thing for a player's Fantasy value (because of playing time concerns and whatnot).6. Moises Ballesteros, Cubs Age (on opening day): 22 Where he played in 2025: Triple-A, majors   Minor league stats: .316 BA (446 AB), 13 HR, 29 2B, .858 OPS, 49 BB, 67 K Major league stats: .298 BA (57 AB), 2 HR, 2 2B, .868 OPS, 9 BB, 12 K \nThe first thing you'll notice about Ballesteros is that he's built like a bowling ball, but what matters more is his uncanny knack for making good contact on bad pitches, which points to high batting average potential. He's often compared to Alejandro Kirk because of his shape, position and contact skills, but I think a Pablo Sandoval comp more accurately captures his upside as a hitter, not to mention his likelihood of moving off catcher. Note: Ballesteros is eligible only at DH to begin 2026 since that's where he spent most of his time with the big club in 2025. Because I won't be ranking DH prospects, though, I thought it only fitting for me to rank him at his natural position, even if the odds are against him sticking there.  7. Harry Ford, NationalsAge (on opening day): 23   Where he played in 2025: Triple-A, majors   Minor league stats: .283 BA (374 AB), 16 HR, 7 SB, .868 OPS, 74 BB, 88 K \nFord reversed the trend of declining power with his move up to Triple-A, positioning himself as a top catcher prospect again, but the tradeoff is that he gave up on being a base-stealer, dropping from 35 in 2024 to seven in 2025. Still, the overall profile appears to be more viable, particularly when you factor in his career .405 on-base percentage in the minors, and now that his competition is Keibert Ruiz instead of Cal Raleigh, he has a real chance to break through in 2026. 8. Eduardo Tait, Twins Age (on opening day): 19 Where he played in 2025: Low-A, High-A Minor league stats: .253 BA (438 AB), 14 HR, 32 2B, .738 OPS, 36 BB, 99 K The stat line may not blow you away, but there's plenty of upside to project onto Tait, who shows considerable power potential with his exit velocities peaking near 114 mph as a teenager. He has yet to fully actualize that power and has strides to make with regard to pitch selection in defense, but the prize of the Jhoan Duran deal is well ahead of the developmental curve, having reached High-A prior to turning 19. \n 9. Ethan Salas, Padres Age (on opening day): 19 Where he played in 2025: Double-A Minor league stats: 6 for 32 (.188), 1 2B, 2 SB, 6 BB, 5 K It feels obligatory to rank Salas here given the mountains of praise heaped upon him as a 17-year-old, but the honest truth is that he hasn't hit a lick in the two years since. Granted, he didn't get a fair shot in 2025, missing most of the year with a stress reaction in his back, and he remains young for his level even if no longer outrageously so. Factor in his Gold Glove-caliber defense, and he's not yet a lost cause.  10. Cooper Ingle, GuardiansAge (on opening day): 24   Where he played in 2025: Double-A, Triple-A   Minor-league stats: .260 BA (510 AB), 10 HR, 36 2B, .808 OPS, 86 BB, 85 K \nThere isn't a clear choice for the No. 10 spot, so while I have some affection for Leonardo Bernal, Jeferson Quero and Marco Dinges, I'll opt for the catcher with the clearest path to playing time, which is Ingle. A Jonathan Lucroy type who consistently walks more than he strikes out and hits doubles like they're going out of style, Ingle may be ready to push Bo Naylor, who has yet to find his footing in the majors after several years of trying.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        It's the most wonderful time of the year. That time, of course, is College Football Playoff season, and the 12-team bracket kicks off on Friday, Dec. 19, with an all-SEC matchup: No. 9 seed Alabama at No. 8 Oklahoma squaring off for a spot in the quarterfinals.The game is a rematch of one played in Tuscaloosa, Ala., on Nov. 15. In that matchup, the Sooners overcame a punchless offense by forcing three turnovers to pull off a 23-21 upset. That victory helped Oklahoma (10-2) end the season on a four-game winning streak, which included three wins over ranked teams. Meanwhile, Alabama (10-3) is coming off a listless 28-7 loss to Georgia in the SEC Championship Game and had to sweat out the CFP selection committee's bracket reveal.Bet the College Football Playoff, including Oklahoma vs. Alabama, at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets. Click here to sign up:The winner of Friday's rematch between the Sooners and Crimson Tide will advance to the Rose Bowl for a CFP quarterfinal matchup against the No. 1-ranked Indiana Hoosiers.Top sportsbooks have made Alabama a 1.5-point favorite over Oklahoma. The line originally opened as a pick 'em.So what should you make of that line movement? Is it a market correction or an overreaction? Here's a look at the Sooners-Crimson Tide point spread, as well as the line movement of the three other CFP games. All times Eastern.No. 9 Alabama at No. 8 Oklahoma (8 p.m. Dec. 19)Open: Pick 'emCurrent: Alabama -1.5The season's first College Football Playoff game opened as a pick 'em at Circa but has remained steady after some initial betting. Considering that Sooners beat the Crimson Tide one month ago in Tuscaloosa, the fact that Oklahoma is an underdog in this game is telling. Alabama outgained Oklahoma 406 yards to 212 and had a 95% win expectancy in that game but was done in by three turnovers. What are the odds the Sooners will force three turnovers again? This line movement seems like a reasonable market correction.Bet College Football Playoff games at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $150 in bonus bets. Click here:No. 10 Miami at No. 7 Texas A&M (noon Dec. 20)Open: Texas A&M -4Current: Texas A&M -3.5This line opened at -5.5 in some places but has moved in favor of the Hurricanes (10-2). This likely is a reaction to the Aggies' last game, a 27-17 loss at No. 16 Texas, which really put A&M's season in a different light; the Longhorns were the only SEC team in the top half of the conference standings that the Aggies (11-1) played. A&M's best win this season, by far, came against Notre Dame, but Miami beat the Irish, too. The -3.5 seems fair, but Hurricanes backers shouldn't delay as betting trends don't suggest this line will return to its opening line barring an injury. Bet College Football Playoff games at Caesars Sportsbook, where new users get 20 100% profit boost tokens. Click here to get started:No. 11 Tulane at No. 6 Ole Miss (3:30 p.m. Dec. 20)Open: Ole Miss -16Current: Ole Miss -17.5This is another rematch of a game played earlier this season. On Sept. 20, the Rebels blew out the Green Wave 45-10 in Oxford in a game that wasn't as close as the final score suggests. Ole Miss outgained Tulane 548 yards to 282 and led 45-3 that day before giving up a meaningless touchdown with 3:42 left in the game. That 35-point margin is certainly a major reason why the early money came in on Ole Miss (11-1) despite the Rebels losing coach Lane Kiffin to LSU. Obviously bettors don't believe Kiffin is worth 19 points on the point spread over new coach Pete Golding. If you agree with the bettors that Ole Miss will not regress without Kiffin, you should jump on this number now as it's only likely to go up.No. 12 James Madison at No. 5 Oregon (7:30 p.m. Dec. 20)Open: Oregon -20Current: Oregon -21.5This is the kind of game in which the Ducks usually roll. Since Dan Lanning took over as coach in 2022, Oregon is 10-0 against non-major conference teams with an average margin of victory of 36.3 points per game. However, this game may be a little different. First, James Madison is not your run-of-the-mill Group of Five team. The Dukes can run the ball (245.8 rushing yards per game, sixth in the country) and stop the run (76.2 rushing yards allowed per game, second in the nation). Also, even if this game gets out of hand, will the Ducks want to keep running their starters out there knowing they have a quarterfinal matchup against Texas Tech ahead? Oregon deserves to be a big favorite, but a backdoor cover is a possibility.\n            ",

Moore, who just completed his third season with the Tigers, will replace former Washington State coach Jimmy Rogers after he left for the same position at Iowa State.The Cougars are taking a big swing on upside with Moore, who has yet to be a head coach at the collegiate level. A former Boise State wide receiver, Moore heads to Pullman with nine seasons of assistant coaching experience at the FBS level. Moore has established himself as one of the SEC's top offensive assistants in recent years. He initially joined Missouri's staff in 2023 as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach and served in that dual capacity until 2025, when his focus turned entirely to calling offensive plays. In three seasons under Moore, Missouri's offense has averaged 418 yards and 31.2 points per game. He was responsible for developing former Missouri quarterback Brady Cook, who won 20 games while throwing for 5,852 yards and 32 touchdowns in two years under Moore. \nMissouri also produced the nation's second-leading rusher in 2025 after running back Ahmad Hardy ran for 1,560 yards on 241 carries. Hardy's 16 touchdowns rushing ranked second among SEC running backs. Missouri's 234.1 yards rushing per game paced the SEC and landed at eighth among FBS programs. Prior to landing at Missouri, Moore spent three seasons as an assistant at Fresno State. He started out as the pass game coordinator and wide receivers coach from 2020-21 before he was elevated to offensive coordinator in 2022. \nMoore has connections in the Pacific Northwest from his time as a graduate assistant at Washington (2015-16). He also attended Prosser High School in Washington and is the younger brother of New Orleans Saints coach Kellen Moore. \n            \n    ",

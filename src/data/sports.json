    "body": "\nA week ago, I had the Chiefs as the clear No. 1 team in my betting power ratings, the Lions at No. 2, and then a tight bunch of contenders grouped in the NFL's 1B tier. Then, despite coming off a bye with two weeks to prepare, Kansas City's offense could not find consistent success, while the defense made Bo Nix look closer to Patrick Mahomes than the QB he has been the majority of the last five weeks. The Lions removed themselves from No. 1 consideration with the worst game Jared Goff and Amon-Ra St. Brown have had perhaps ever.So who should be at the top?The Seahawks were just as much of a disaster offensively as the Lions.Their opponent, the Rams, needed four terrible Sam Darnold picks just to win by two points.The Ravens did not lead the Browns from the beginning of the second quarter until 2:31 left in the game.The Bills offense woke up against the Buccaneers, but the defense is going to force them to score 40 every week to secure wins.The Eagles defense dominated the Lions offense, but Philly's offense piled a Lane Johnson injury on top of the rest of its issues.The Packers offense appears to have similar issues, including a key player suffering an injury on Sunday in Josh Jacobs.The Patriots? They allowed 14 points to the Jets, which translates to allowing 42 points against a legitimate NFL offense.That leaves the Colts, who won the week by not playing. Indianapolis has the No. 1 offense in yards per play in the league, ranking first in yards per rush behind Offensive Player of the Year front-runner Jonathan Taylor and No. 4 in yards per pass play behind a strong, downfield attack led by Daniel Jones. If not for a few disaster games in terms of turnovers (three against the Rams, six against the Steelers), the Colts might be undefeated heading into a massive matchup with the Chiefs.This is the game that was supposed to tell us whether the Colts were legit, but with the Chiefs reeling the last few weeks, they're the team with more to prove. That's not reflected in the betting line for the game, which has the Chiefs laying more than a field goal at some books. I expect that to drop as we get closer to Sunday kickoff, and I've locked in a play on the Colts already.\nI'll have several more spread picks this week at SportsLine, where members are able to get access to all my picks throughout the week as they're made and hopefully take advantage of some good line value.Let's dive into our betting power ratings and highlight a few more teams of note.Week 12 power ratingsTeam12111098IND65.5554.5LAR5.55.554.54.5DET5.565.566SEA5.55.554.54.5KC5.5777.56.5BAL55550BUF5564.54.5PHI4.55.554.53.5GB44554NE43.52.52.52TB11111DEN10101SF1-10-10HOU0100-1CHI0-1-1-1.5-1DAL0-1-1-11LAC011.521JAC-1-2-1.5-1-1.5PIT-1.5-1001MIN-20-1-1.5-1ARI-2.5-2-1-1-1.5NYG-3-3.5-3.5-3.5-2CAR-3.5-4-3.5-4.5-3.5ATL-4-10-10MIA-4-4.5-5-4.5-5LV-5.5-4-3.5-3.5-4.5CIN-5.5-5-5-4.5-4.5WAS-5.5-5.5-3.5-10CLE-5.5-5.5-5.5-5.5-5NO-5.5-5.5-6.5-5.5-4.5NYJ-9-7.5-6.5-6-6TEN-9   -8-8-8-7We ran through the top 10 teams in the intro, and I think you can justify any order for that group of 10, which brings the opportunity of a fascinating postseason. Will the Colts stumble once they face a top defense and Daniel Jones succumbs to turnovers? Does Sam Darnold have any hope of meeting the moment in a big spot? Will any of the four preseason favorites -- Chiefs, Bills, Ravens or Eagles -- get their issues ironed out in time to make run through a bunch of flawed teams en route to a title?One team I refuse to put in the conversation of potential contenders is the Broncos, who won a massive game against the Chiefs but have looked so mediocre offensively for a majority of the season that I have a hard time buying in regardless of Sunday's result. The only one of our 10 contenders with fewer yards per play on the season is the Eagles, with the Broncos ranking 17th to go with their top-ranked defense. When you look at passing offense, all 10 of our contenders rank in the top 12 in yards per play (along with the Cowboys and 49ers); the Broncos sit at No. 25. That's why I can't move Denver any higher than a tier with the Bucs and 49ers, two expected contenders that are starting to get healthier heading into the stretch run.I'm out on the Chargers after they got blown out of the stadium by a mediocre Jaguars team, and I'm even more out on the Vikings after J.J. McCarthy looked like the worst quarterback in the league in what should've been an easy matchup against a beat-up Bears secondary. I look at the two teams I have below Minnesota (the Cardinals and Giants) and I'm not sure I could take them on a neutral field against either, so perhaps they need to keep moving down.The Falcons in theory are a team capable of handling a QB injury with Kirk Cousins as one of the best backups in the league, at least in terms of resume. But what have we seen of Cousins to have any confidence he'll keep his team competitive? His five drives against the Panthers were unimpressive, his spot start earlier in the season resulted in an uncompetitive loss to a Dolphins team that had just been blown out by the Browns, and he had brief mop-up duty in the shutout loss to the Panthers. That's following a season where he got benched but still led the league in interceptions. Now he takes over an offense that will also be missing its only legit receiver in Drake London. I've dropped them to just ahead of the rest of the non-basement bad teams, but even then, I'm not sure why I didn't go all the way down to that level.Full Week 12 projected linesAwayHomeLookaheadConsensusPR SpreadNotesBUFHOU+2.5+5.5+3.5No drop-off from Stroud to Mills?NECIN+5.5+8.5+7.5PR +8.5 if Chase loses appealINDKC-4.5-3.5-1NYGDET-11-10.5-9.5PR assumes Dart's returnMINGB-6.5-6.5-7.5PITCHI-1.5-3-4NYJBAL-14.5-13.5-15.5SEATEN+12.5+13.5+12CLELV-1.5-3-1.5No drop from Gabriel to SandersJACARI-1.5+2.5-0.5ATLNO+3.5-1.5-1PHIDAL+3.5+3.5+3.5TBLAR-6-6.5-6CAR   SF   -6.5   -6.5-7   This is how I would set each game based on my power ratings and home field advantage data for this week.

    "body": "\n        Playing their first game since the death of 24-year-old defensive end Marshawn Kneeland, the Cowboys' 33-16 win over the Raiders was filled with emotions for quarterback Dak Prescott, owner Jerry Jones and others. The Cowboys donned \"94\" helmet decals and had warm-up shirts with Kneeland across the front to honor their teammate.\"It's been obviously a tough, hard 12 days,\" Prescott said after throwing for 268 yards and four touchdowns. \"Through the bye week, those first few days not being with the guys was harder than anything. But the last six, seven being together, working together, having conversations, healing, shining light on who Marshawn was. Then obviously coming out here tonight and playing with the style he played with, the intensity, the effort to finish, super proud of the guys.\"Whirlwind of a week, great one to cap off with a win right here, but this doesn't put a cap on it. We're going to continue to move forward, shining a light on Marshawn and carrying his legacy. We need to play like this every week moving forward, he'll always be with us.\"The Cowboys (4-5-1) spent 11 days in mourning before paying tribute to Kneeland with one of their most complete performances of the season. \"I'm proud of every last one of the staff and the coaches, Brian, his leadership throughout and the players,\" Jones said. \"This obviously is tough, but in a way, a game, a competition like this with the Raiders is good therapy to come back and get in it. They know how much that Marshawn loved to compete, how much he loved the Cowboys, and to me it's just a way of saying 'this one's for you, Marshawn.\"\nCowboys coach Brian Schottenheimer said he was proud of the way his players persevered through grief, crying and laughter in their way of honoring Kneeland. Schottenheimer's post-game speech centered around Kneeland, moments after he pointed to his warm-up shirt to the Cowboys' faithful.\"We started talking about Marshawn and how proud he would be,\" Schottenheimer said. \"And with the way we played the game. Then I tried to compose myself, and I did, and we did our normal celebration because that's what we do.\"A 2024 second-round pick, Kneeland was in the middle of his second season in Dallas. His scored his first career touchdown on a blocked punt recovery in the end zone against the Cardinals on Nov. 3. Kneeland was found dead three days later and the cause was a self-inflicted gunshot wound following a police chase for a traffic violation, according to the Frisco Police Department and Texas Department of Public Safety.\n\"He's part of our family forever. It's been tough, these past 11 days have been really tough,\" Schottenheimer said. \"I'm proud of those guys, because the way they played today, they played with Marshawn's play style.\"\n            ",

Among the biggest is when the AFC South-leading Indianapolis Colts led by quarterback Daniel Jones face the nine-time defending AFC West champion Kansas City Chiefs and quarterback Patrick Mahomes, The Chiefs have struggled to a 5-5 mark this season, which makes this as close to a must-win situation as can be this far into the season for Kansas City.

They did not specify what prompted that decision. After the game, Cowboys coach Brian Schottenheimer said that the benching was due to \"a couple things missed.\" \nBoth players returned for the Cowboys' second drive and ultimately played big roles in Dallas' 33-16 win. Pickens caught 9 of 11 targets for 144 yards and a score, while Lamb pitched in with 5 receptions (on 7 targets) for 66 yards and a touchdown. \nAs expected both players were asked afterward about starting the game on the bench. \"Not going into depth on that honestly,\" Lamb said. \"I'm not. I'm sorry. I'm not.\"Pickens attributed the benching to the Cowboys' offensive game plan. Dallas' first drive featured two runs by Javonte Williams and a third-down pass from Dak Prescott. The Cowboys' offense mirrored that sequence when Pickens and Lamb came onto the field for the team's second drive. \n\"I feel like certain personnels are built for the running game, we kind of knew that we could exploit them running wise,\" Pickens said. \"So a lot of heavy personnel.\"Based on Cowboys owner Jerry Jones' postgame comments, it doesn't appear that there is any lingering issues regarding Dallas' star receivers, especially Pickens. \"Pickens was — I've never seen a performance like that,\" Jones said. \"It was poetic the way that he was making those moves out there. It was like he was in an opera or something out there. A ballet,\" \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Right fielder Kyle Tucker hits free agency for the first time this offseason. He'll be 29 years old next season and is a four-time All-Star, two-time Silver Slugger, Gold Glove winner and 2022 World Series champion. He's finished as high as fifth in MVP voting before. \n        \n            \n                Ranking top 50 MLB free agents for 2026: Kyle Tucker, Alex Bregman at top, plus landing spots for every player\n                \n                    R.J. Anderson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWe ranked Tucker as the best free agent available this offseason. Here's what we wrote: Bill James once theorized that it's better for a player's perception for them to start hot and finish cold than the inverse -- that way their numbers are more impressive for a longer period of time. Tucker tested that idea. He entered July sporting a .931 OPS, but from there on he posted an ice-cold .690 mark. His downturn seems connected to injuries, specifically the fractured hand he suffered in June. Tucker still produced his fifth consecutive four-win season, so the shape of his year may prove irrelevant to teams seeking a star-level performer who is good at everything (albeit seldom ranked among the league leaders at anything).In parts of eight seasons, Tucker -- the former first-round draft pick -- is a .273/.358/.507 (140 OPS+) hitter. His 162-game averages are 34 doubles, four triples, 31 home runs, 103 RBI, 96 runs, 25 stolen bases and 5.8 WAR.  1. Strengths Tucker is relatively close to being a five-tool star. In the outfield, he rarely makes errors and has a decent-to-good arm. He's stolen at least 25 bases in a season three times, topping out at 30 in 2023. He's hit 30 home runs in a season twice and got to 29 in 2023. He's topped 20 homers five times. He's hit .294, .289 and .284 in his three best batting average seasons.The bat-to-ball skills on Tucker are pretty great for a power hitter. He's never struck out 100 times in a season (his high was 95 in 2022 and that was in 609 plate appearances). The following year, he came to the plate 674 times and only struck out 92 times. Last season, he walked 87 times compared to 88 strikeouts. In this day and age, those are awfully low strikeout totals, especially for a power hitter. Last season, he was in the 98th percentile in chase percentage (that is, he very rarely chases balls outside the strike zone) and had one of the highest walk rates in baseball. \nWhen he's right, Tucker is a monster at the plate. In just 78 games in 2024, he hit 23 home runs with a 179 OPS+. He had a 21-game stretch early last season during which he hit .357/.450/.738 with seven doubles, two triples, seven homers, 23 RBI and 24 runs. He later had an 18-game stretch in which he hit .348/.416/.609. Tucker is also battle-tested in the playoffs. He's already played in 72 career postseason games, including 17 World Series games. He hit two homers in Game 1 of the 2022 World Series and has had several other big playoff moments.\n 2. Weaknesses Though he flashed great range earlier in his career, specifically 2022, Tucker's defense has suffered a downturn and he's posted negative defensive WARs in two of the past three seasons. He was roughly a league average defender last season by several metrics, but his range dipped into the negative. That's a concern as he ages.\nThere's also a streakiness to Tucker's offense. I mentioned those two hot streaks from 2025, but he still ended up hitting .266 with a .464 slugging percentage on the season. There was a 25-game stretch during which Tucker hit .163 with a .186 slugging. Unfortunately, that came when the rest of the Cubs' offense was struggling mightily, too -- that is to say, exactly when they needed their star to step up and he didn't. There was word that Tucker had a pinky injury lingering from early June that affected his play. He hit .311/.404/.578 in June though. Either he was fine playing through the injury at first and it got worse later -- Tucker and Cubs said it was fully healed by August -- or he just had a horrific slump while fully healthy. Tucker then got really hot for 11 games before suffering a calf injury that affected him the rest of the season. The injury concerns have to be mentioned here. Tucker missed more than half of the 2024 season due to a right shin bruise from a foul ball. Then he may or may not have been adversely affected by a pinky injury in 2025 before a calf injury cost him several weeks. \nHe had been pretty durable before 2024 and those injuries seemed to be more bad luck than anything.Regardless, we haven't yet seen Tucker break through the stardom ceiling and get into superstar territory yet -- at least not for a full season. His career high in single-season WAR is 5.5 while he hasn't gone for more than 30 homers or 30 steals and hasn't hit .300 or topped .400 OBP in a full season. He looked like he'd shatter a few of those marks in 2024 (he got to 5.5 WAR in 78 games), but we saw how hot and cold he can be in 2025. Is he capable of playing like an 8-WAR MVP in a full season? If teams are looking to pay top dollar for his services in free agency, they'll be betting that he is. He just hasn't done that yet. \n 3. Contract prediction Contracts keep moving higher and higher, which means the knee-jerk reaction to seeing Tucker hit free agency is to look at Juan Soto last offseason getting 15 years and $765 million, but c'mon. Soto now has at least three seasons that would've been Tucker's best and he hit free agency three years younger than Tucker. Any estimates over $600 million seem outlandish. I don't even think Tucker gets to $500 million and let's be clear: that's no insult. The average annual value can be stretched out if a team gives Tucker 10 years to lock him up until close to 40 years old, with the assumption being that the overpay at the back end is worth it after getting the value out of the first half of the contract. My guess to start is 10 years and $350 million, which means it'll continue to inch upward as negotiations progress (inch is a bad term there; maybe he foots or yards or miles upward?).\nWe'll go with $425 million over 10 years, possibly with some creative options pushing it to 12 years to spread out the money a little more. That would get him through his age-40 season.  4. Potential suitors The Cubs should be in line if they truly think the awful stretch was due to the fluke pinky injury, but we've seen ownership in the last five or so years show a yearning to operate more as a middle-market team than a large-market team. They'll talk to him but we can probably cross them off.The Dodgers could trade Teoscar Hernández and make a run at Tucker to play right field. \nI'm not sure they'll want to spend in this deep end of the pool again after the Marcus Semien/Corey Seager offseason, but there's a fit on the Rangers, especially if they decide to move Adolis García or limit his playing time after these last two bad years.The Phillies have a pretty terrible outfield as things stand and have shown the willingness to spend huge.Would the Yankees try to make room? It would require Aaron Judge moving back to center field or Tucker going to left, but they made a strong run to retain Juan Soto last offseason. \nThe Blue Jays are said to be more focused on pitching, but if they lose Bo Bichette to free agency, Tucker is a great fit there. Addison Barger and Davis Schneider took starts in the outfield last season but can also swing into the infield while Ernie Clement can play any infield position to make things work.The Giants have been involved in talks for the likes of Aaron Judge and Carlos Correa, and we know Buster Posey wants to continue to make big splashes. Tucker could work here.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Welcome to Snyder's Soapbox! Here, I pontificate about matters related to Major League Baseball on a weekly basis. Some of the topics will be pressing matters, some might seem insignificant in the grand scheme of things, and most will be somewhere in between. The good thing about this website is that it's free, and you are allowed to click away. If you stay, you'll get smarter, though. That's a money-back guarantee. Let's get to it.In the aftermath of the unbelievable Game 7 win by the Dodgers over the Blue Jays to repeat as World Series champions, pitcher Tyler Glasnow, alongside teammate Blake Snell, celebrated in the clubhouse by offering the wisdom \"if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.\" \nGlasnow and Snell were on the 2020 Rays, who lost the World Series to the Dodgers. Glasnow was traded to the Dodgers before the 2024 season and signed an extension. Snell was on the 2022 Padres, who beat the Dodgers in the NLDS, before he signed with the Dodgers as a free agent last offseason. Let's be clear before moving forward: This is, overall, pretty harmless. They were giddy with excitement after winning the World Series and celebrating. Glasnow probably didn't even think his phrase through. It's not that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things. \nI'm still annoyed though. It makes me think about the NBA when superstar players join up together, such as LeBron James and Chris Bosh joining Dwyane Wade on the Heat. Or how about the true \"can't beat 'em, join 'em\" moment with Kevin Durant going to the Warriors? The sentiment of \"oh well, we lost to that team so I'm just going to jump to the winners instead of trying to beat them\" goes against everything that is -- or should be, in a perfect world -- the spirit of competitive sports. Shouldn't the biggest competitors want to topple the beast? Yes, comfort always plays into decisions when it comes to free agency, but there's something to be said for getting outside one's comfort zone. Sometimes that's when our best work in life is done. Of course, a player shouldn't be blamed for taking the highest offer, either. It always makes me laugh when people complain about players taking the most money in free agency, as if we wouldn't all do the same. \nAll things being equal, however, I love to see players taking the path of a challenger rather than hoping to just join the champions. We've seen it before. Jon Lester signed with the Cubs off a 73-win season and won a World Series ring in his second season with them. He even reportedly took less money to do so. With the Yankees coming off their third straight title in 2001, Johnny Damon signed with...the division rival Red Sox. They of course won in 2004.Surely it's pretty damn satisfying to win the World Series, no matter the circumstances. But isn't there a little extra feeling of pride when a player chooses to join a team that hasn't been to the World Series in a long time rather than picking the champs before winning a ring?If you can't beat them, join them? Nah, that's a weak mentality. How about this: I haven't beaten them yet, but I'm going to bust my ass until I do beat them. \nThat's better. Let's live there. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Week 13 college football schedule coincides with that annual late-season SEC slate where many of the teams face Group of Five opponents. While 14 SEC teams are in action, just four games you can make Week 13 college football picks on are conference matchups. It's highlighted by Oklahoma vs. Missouri, a top-25 matchup that has OU as a 7.5-point favorite. There's just one other ranked contest, and it has Oregon as a 10-point favorite over USC, according to the latest Week 13 college football odds.Even with the lack of elite matchups, there are still several interesting games, many of them pitting bitter rivals versus one another. Among them are Tennessee vs. Florida (+4.5), UNC vs. Duke (-6.5), Texas vs. Arkansas (+9.5) and Miami vs. Virginia Tech (+17.5). It wouldn't be the worst thing to seek out some college football betting advice with something unexpected happening seemingly every Saturday.

The K-State defense is among the most opportunistic in the nation, with 24 takeaways on the season and five in Saturday's win over Oklahoma State. Meanwhile, Utah has just six takeaways over its last six games, and the Utes can be sloppy as times, as they've averaged seven penalties over their last four games. That contrasts with the disciplined unit that Chris Klieman leads as KSU averages the fifth-fewest penalties (3.5) in FBS. Excelling on the margins should allow the Wildcats to stay within this spread, with the model having this as a one-score game as KSU covers well over 70% of the time. See the rest of the model's picks here.\nAnother prediction: No. 15 Georgia Tech (-2.5, 62.5) covers against Pitt in almost 60% of simulations Saturday at 7 p.m. ET. Pittsburgh faced its first top-15 squad in Notre Dame on Saturday, and the Panthers were embarrassed in a 22-point defeat. Pitt couldn't stop the Irish's rushing attack, giving up a season-high of 175 yards on the ground, and now Pittsburgh has to face a Yellow Jackets rushing attack that's top 10 in FBS in both yards per game and yards per carry. Not only that, but Georgia Tech's quarterback, Haynes King, also ranks fifth in the country in completion percentage as the Yellow Jackets offense should overwhelm the Panthers. In addition to Georgia Tech covering, the sims also have the Over hitting over 50% of the time. See which other picks the model likes here.\nHow to make college football picks for Week 13The model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every FBS matchup in Week 13, and it's calling for multiple upsets in major games, including a pair of ranked teams outright losing to unranked foes. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine, and for a limited time you can use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1.So what college football picks can you make with confidence, and which ranked squads go down?

    "body": "\n        New York Jets cornerback Kris Boyd, 29, remains in the hospital after he was shot in the abdomen early Sunday morning in New York. CBS News reports that a bullet was lodged in Boyd's lung. He underwent surgery, and is in critical, but stable, condition. The investigation is ongoing after NYPD received a 911 call on Sunday at 2:09 a.m. ET. On Monday, the police released images of a potential suspect wanted in connection with the shooting. Boyd was with a group on West 38th Street between Seventh Avenue and Broadway when an argument took place with another group. Boyd was then hit by gunfire. \"We are aware of the situation involving Kris Boyd and will have no further comment at this time,\" a Jets spokesperson told CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones. The NFL did not offer further comment, telling CBS Sports it has been in contact with the franchise.Boyd has not suited up for the Jets this season. He was placed on injured reserve in August after suffering a shoulder injury during a team scrimmage.\nSeveral players reacted to the frightening news on Sunday, including Jets defensive end Jermaine Johnson II:\n\"It's tough news to hear,\" Jets tight end Jeremy Ruckert said on Monday. \"You know, one of our guys, and you know we're all thinking of him and wishing him well, and his family. So other than that, we're going to keep everything in-house about what's going on. Just thinking of him and his family.\"Boyd, who played his college football at the University of Texas, was originally a seventh-round pick of the Minnesota Vikings in 2019, also playing for the Arizona Cardinals and Houston Texans. Boyd has spent most of his NFL career on special teams, racking up 105 tackles, three pass defenses and two forced fumbles in 81 career games. \nThe Jets did not play on Sunday after falling to the New England Patriots on Thursday night, 27-14. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Virginia Tech should be glad it lost 34-14 at Florida State, even if that means it is back in the Bottom 25 this week. Had the Hokies waltzed into Doak Campbell Stadium and defeated the Seminoles, it would have dropped FSU to 4-6 and may have increased Mike Norvell's chances of getting fired before the end of the season. If Norvell had been fired Sunday, then Virginia Tech may have been dealing with another competitor in the James Franklin sweepstakes. But less than 48 hours after Virginia Tech's loss to the Seminoles, news broke that Franklin will be leading the Hokies.You can expect to see Virginia Tech here for the rest of the season. At 3-9 (2-4 ACC) and with games against Miami and Virginia still remaining, the Hokies may be destined for their second three-win season of the past four years. \n        \n            \n                James Franklin gives Virginia Tech perfect CEO figure as Hokies invest heavily in resurrecting program\n                \n                    Shehan Jeyarajah                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBut they have unequivocally upgraded at head coach by landing Franklin, a proven winner at both Vanderbilt and Penn State. In that sense, the misery of the 2025 season served a purpose. The program's quick hook on Brent Pry allowed the Hokies time to get their administrative ducks in a row to pursue, and land, quality candidate. See! Being in the Botton 25 isn't so bad after all.\nThis year's Bottom 25 formula has been tweaked to ensure fair representation from across the sport. Each of the Power Four leagues gets an automatic bid to the Bottom 25 each week, and a total of 10 Power Four schools must be represented.Bottom 25 Rankings^ Joined Bottom 25 this weekDon't be fooled by Notre DameWhatever Notre Dame does over the final two weeks of the regular season, don't be tricked into thinking it's a legitimate display of power. The Fighting Irish close against Bottom 25 teams Syracuse and Stanford and should obliterate both. In fact, they will probably crush the Orange and the Cardinal with little mercy for the sake of impressing the College Football Playoff selection committee. After an 0-2 start to the season, style points matter. Notre Dame is going to hammer these poor ACC deadbeats.25. Stanford (25)24. Virginia Tech^23. Florida (22)22. Syracuse (21)21. Colorado (20)\nAn expensive train wreck Firing a coach after just two seasons might be hasty, but it would be warranted with Jonathan Smith at Michigan State. The Spartans are 3-7 (0-7 Big Ten) after falling 28-10 at home against a bad Penn State team last week. Michigan State has dropped six of its seven league contests by double digits and is in for another rough day at Iowa this week. A hefty buyout of more than $30 million must be considered, but so should the cost of allowing a train wreck continue. There is no evidence to suggest this program is heading in the right direction.20. Michigan State (24)19. Tulsa (14)18. South Alabama (13)17. Purdue (23)16. Bowling Green (16)The winners tierPeople think the Bottom 25 is all about negativity and dunking on the bad teams. OK, it mostly is. But we are here to celebrate with three teams in this subsection that are coming off Week 12 wins. Sam Houston won its second straight contest following an 0-8 start, and Nevada beat the snot out of San Jose State, 55-10, for its first win over an FBS team this year. Lastly, Northern Illinois crushed UMass 45-3. Unfortunately, beating one of the worst college football teams in a generation isn't going to get you a ton of credit. But it's still a feat worth celebrating for a team like NIU.\n15. Sam Houston (12)14. Nevada (5)13. San Jose State^12. Northern Illinois (8)11. Louisiana-Monroe (15)Agony in ArkansasArkansas continues inventing new ways to lose. In last week's 23-22 loss at LSU, that involved three scoreless trips inside the Tigers' 30-yard line, including two fruitless journeys inside the 10. Still, the Hogs led 22-16 entering he fourth quarter before the Tigers surged ahead with a 92-yard touchdown drive. Six of Arkansas' eight losses have come in one-possession games, and that doesn't even include the Razorbacks' 33-24 loss to Auburn. Arkansas led 24-16 entering the fourth quarter of that game. Any team this consistently committed to losing deserves a top-10 ranking.10. Arkansas (18)9. UTEP (10)8. Boston College (7)7. Colorado State (9)6. Oregon State (11)\nShoutout Derek MorrisA major shoutout to Derek Morris for his 44-yard field goal with 6:13 remaining in UMass' 45-3 home loss to Northern Illinois last week. The kick kept the Minutemen from getting shut out for the first time this season. At this point, comparing 0-10 UMass to other FBS teams is nonsensical. The Minutemen weren't even good enough to beat Bryant back on Sept. 6, and Bryant is just 3-8 at the FCS level this season. Dratings.com places Bryant at No. 104 among FCS teams, which means UMass wouldn't even be one of the 100 best teams if it dropped down a level. At best, we're probably talking about an average Division II team here.5. Middle Tennessee (6)4. Charlotte (4)3. Georgia State (3)2. Oklahoma State (2)1. UMass (1)\n            ",

    "body": "\n        TAMPA, Fla. – As the U.S. men's national team took to the field for the final training session of 2025 on Monday, they were undoubtedly in the \"up\" part in a year of ups and downs. The World Cup co-hosts are in the midst of a four match unbeaten run, an ideal trade for the four match losing streak they had as they entered last summer's Concacaf Gold Cup. It makes Tuesday's clash against Uruguay a fitting capstone for a year full of trials and tribulations for Mauricio Pochettino's side. They will have a chance to measure their progress against the very same opponent they lost to in the Copa America last year, which closed the chapter on Gregg Berhalter's time in charge of the USMNT.That defeat was essentially the origin story of Pochettino's project, if informally. U.S. Soccer decided a drastic change was needed ahead of a World Cup on home soil, forcing the federation to change the captain of their ship \"in the middle of your travels.\"\"Why we are here is because something was wrong, no?,\" Pochettino said on Monday. \"If not, one year ago, you keep going with the same project because it's not easy to change in the middle of your travels. You don't change the captain of the ship in the middle of the storm. No, you give confidence and try but if something was wrong, you need to change.\"How to watch the USMNT vs. Uruguay, oddsDate: Tuesday, Nov. 18 | Time: 7 p.m. ETLocation: Raymond James Stadium -- Tampa, Fla.Odds: USMNT +250; Draw +210; Uruguay +115A year later and 1,000 miles away from the loss in Kansas City, change is clear to see. Just nine members of the Copa America roster are in camp this month, for starters, but that merely scratches the surface on Pochettino's influence on the team. His version of the team is virtually unrecognizable compared to Berhalter's, chiefly in their style of play. Pochettino's switch to a back three, first implemented in the second half of September's 2-0 loss to South Korea, continues to pay dividends especially as the head coach names lineups that are markedly different from game to game. Lineup changes are to be expected on Tuesday, too, for a variety of practical reasons, including the quick turnaround after Saturday's 2-1 win over Paraguay.\nCall it What You Want: A weekly podcast where Jimmy Conrad, Charlie Davies and Tony Meola cover all things USMNT and the state of the beautiful game in the United States. Catch the show YouTube live every Tuesday and Thursday at 10 a.m. ET.\"Tommorow is a good chance for some players that didn't play in the first half [against Paraguay], for sure,\" Pochettino said, \"because it's not only to give the c hance, because there's not going to be a lot of time after to have the possibility to play.\"Pochettino's year-long demand for onlookers to be patient has paid off, to the point that it is starting to become reasonable to expect the USMNT to look and play a certain way when they hit the pitch. The high-intensity, attack-minded vision Pochettino has built at different club teams during his 16-year coaching career is now clear to see with the U.S. team, Pochettino sharing a long list of principles for his team regardless of personnel.\n\"I think the identity is the way that we build from [the] back and the way that we respect the principles of the game,\" he said, \"the tactical work in the way that we play, in the capacity to rotate and how we use the space, how we build from back, how we, with the medium block, or when we are in the transition to going to dominate the game in the opposite half, all the space that we found and we use in the way that we use [it], in the way that we understand the different movements. We know very well in a team when you work every day, it's easier to find this dynamic but when you are in a national team, it's more difficult because [there's] always different players. You don't have time but I think that the way that we play, that is the identity that we want to translate in the next games.\"Problem-solving is a key demand from Pochettino to his players, according to defender Mark McKenzie, who watched Saturday's win from the bench but saw his teammates combat challenges in real time.\"We watched video on them and the way they are very aggressive,\" McKenzie said, \"and especially when it comes to pressing and building their press so I think we did a really good job of suffocating them, especially after we lost the ball and also stifling them in their transitions, which we knew they really were really strong in. I think those are two areas where the team has shown [that] we know how to solve and even if they do sit back and in a medium block, we were paying for a high press. How to control the tempo of the match, move the ball side to side, playing central passes, trying to break the lines to find our creative players in the pocket and then ultimately allow our attackers to be able to do what they do in the final third.\"\nIntensity is becoming a mainstay of the USMNT's approach, too. The fight that broke out at the end of the win over Paraguay is perhaps an extreme example, one that Pochettino hopes does \"not need to be the [only] signal of our identity\" but harkens back to previous versions of the team. Years before Berhalter's tenure came to a close with a listless and uninspiring edition of the USMNT, the group were known for a physical, hard-working mentality. Pochettino and company are finding a way to mix style with an aggression, which is especially suitable against opponents like Paraguay and Uruguay, for whom no game is a friendly.\"I think it's important that we bring that intensity from the start like we did just from pressing, winning the ball, duels,\" midfielder Tanner Tessman said. \"Those are the main things, definitely, to start with and I think we've grown into that over the past year, year and a half with Poch so I think it's been good. With that, I think that the national team has had that identity in the past and it's something that we want to have. When the opponent plays us, that they know it's going to be a difficult game on an intensity level and then how we play – if we have a bad game, a good game, with the ball without the ball, whatever it is, fine –  but I think the intensity is the thing that we want to bring to the table, for sure.\"Pochettino is always quick to remind that his reinvention of the team is not complete – and is happening on a truncated timeline, especially after March's Concacaf Nations League defeats forced him to \"destroy the things we need[ed] to destroy\" and start from scratch. With just three friendlies left and a single digit number of training sessions before Pochettino locks in a World Cup roster, though, the USMNT's period of upheaval and transition has finally given way for a phase of stability.\n\"Yesterday, I showed some sentences to the players: 'Let's be realistic and do the impossible,'\" Pochettino shared, the latest in a list of motivational quotes for the players that have begun to trickle out in press conferences and Instagram Stories. \"I think that was good for us to see the reality. When the reality [hits], it's not the reality that you perceive or are trying to see or were convinced that was different. I think it's a good point to do the impossible, to change reality and that is in the way that we start to work. … You need to be relaxed to work, be strong, settle your principles. Sometimes [we] struggled with the result. I'm not saying now we are fantastic. We need to improve a lot. It is not now that we are so good, we are so happy. I think we are settled and changing the mindset and I think that is working.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        LAS VEGAS -- The Dallas Cowboys knew when they traded for explosive, 24-year-old wide receiver George Pickens that they were signing up for the whole package: the energy, excitement and moments that make coaches and teammates alike shake their heads.Dallas will take the entire package that Pickens provides after his relentless energy helped fuel the Cowboys to an overpowering 33-16 victory over the Las Vegas Raiders on \"Monday Night Football\" in Week 11.He produced a game-high 144 yards receiving on a game-high nine catches, which included a 37-yard touchdown catch that began with him breaking ankles and ended with Pickens throwing himself into the goal post.\"I don't know what made me jump on the goal post, but I'm not going to do that again,\" Pickens said with a smile. \"... I probably just say God gifted, thank God.\n\"Turned around and caught an in route. I was a little short [of the sticks]. A guy missed a tackle, running full speed. Walked into the end zone. I don't know about the goal post.\"\"He's a one-of-a-kind guy,\" Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott added of Pickens. \"Special individual. Elite. Has a great feel for the game. Loves the game. Plays the game like a kid. When you watch him play, the energy, the celebrations, that's contagious.\"\nPickens' energy also led to him breaking four or five tackles on an eventual gain of 21 yards that energized Dallas in the second half.\n\"Credit to the guys, for real, for real,\" Pickens said. \"As far as me on my behalf, I'll probably just say running the ball hard. I feel like that's one thing I was emphasizing after the catch.\"I knew they were going to be having a lot of zone drops. A lot of zone drops. Definitely run after catch.\"  \nCoach Brian Schottenheimer is more than willing to deal with things like Pickens' unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for jumping into the goal post after his 37-yard catch-and-run touchdown because of Pickens' electricity being more of a benefit than a detractor.\nThat said, Schottenheimer is still working on fine tuning that balance with Pickens after having him and wide receiver CeeDee Lamb sit out the opening series of the game.\"I love the energy he brings. We talk. We share an arm around the shoulder a little bit, but he's a fun guy to coach, man,\" Cowboys coach Brian Schottenheimer said. \"The energy that you see on the field, on the game, is the way he approaches practices. That's what I love about him, and it's cool for me as a coach, again, to see the relationship with him and CeeDee.\"... You try to play on the edge and not go over the edge, and he's kind of right here all the time. That's why I think he's such a great player, but I'll say it again: I love him. I really do. I love the young man. I tell him that all the time.\"\nHis effort turning into a final box score total of 144 yards is eye popping, but Pickens calmly declared that these types of nights could be the norm for him while playing with Prescott and Lamb in Schottenheimer's offense. \"Just really credit to the guys -- honestly, bro,\" Pickens said. \"I can only do this as much as they can you know what I mean? I'm with them every day. I just feel like when we execute those types of games can happen for me. Definitely shout out to the guys.\"\"GP was bothering [the defense] today,\" Lamb said.How much will Pickens' price tag cost? Pickens is in the final year of his rookie deal in 2025, and he's been bothering the entire league in Year 1 as a Cowboy. His 908 yards receiving this season rank as the second-most in the NFL behind only Seattle Seahawks wideout Jaxon Smith-Njigba's's 1,146, but Pickens' 908 yards receiving through 10 games are the most in Cowboys history in a player's first 10 games with the team.\nHis 10-game start with 908 yards and seven receiving touchdowns on 58 catches also makes Pickens the fourth player in Cowboys history with at least 900 yards receiving and seven touchdowns through seven games.He joins Hall of Famers Bob Hayes (1966), Michael Irvin (1995) and Terrell Owens (2007) in that exclusive club.Most receiving yards in first 10 career games with Cowboys, franchise historyReceiving YardsGeorge Pickens (2025)908Amari Cooper (2018-2019)831Raghib Ismail (1999)749Terrell Owens (2006)724Bob Hayes (1965)721With Pickens playing at an All-Pro level, that raises the question of what his market next offseason will be and how both he and the Cowboys will approach his looming contract negotiations. Factoring in both his age (24) and him currently being the NFL's No. 2 leader in receiving yards, Pickens' market is climbing into the top five contracts stratosphere at the position.The closest age comparison at this financial level is New York Jets No. 1 wide receiver Garrett Wilson. He's 25 years old and on a four-year, $130 million contract, a deal that ranks as the fifth-best at the wide receiver position in both total value and average per year salary ($32.5 million).However, how much Pickens gets paid will also fall on what his priorities are. If it's to get the most money possible, he could find himself franchise-tagged or on another team in 2026.If it's to keep putting up video game numbers alongside Prescott and Lamb in Schottenheimer's offense, then there could be a long-term deal to keep him in Dallas if he's willing to take a slightly below market deal.Owner and general manager Jerry Jones did say a month ago that he was considering making salary cap room to pay Pickens at a high level. Pickens himself said at the end of October that he \"wouldn't mind, definitely\" re-signing with the Cowboys.The ball is in Jones' court to shrug off his salary cap fears and make an effort to re-sign Pickens like the wide receiver shrugged off Raiders defenders. What is known is the longer Jones waits to re-sign Pickens, the more his price tag will continue to climb.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        There's a bit of symmetry with the Week 12 NFL odds as three games have a spread of a field goal or less, while three contests also have a double-digit NFL line. Amongst the former are Steelers vs. Bears (-3) and Jaguars vs. Cardinals (+2.5), while double-digit favorites to place Week 12 NFL bets on are Seattle (-13) versus Tennessee and Detroit (-10.5) versus the Giants. However, it's a team that isn't even over .500 which is the biggest favorite on the Week 12 NFL schedule.Baltimore has won four straight to get back into the playoff picture, and they'll host the Jets on Sunday. The Ravens are at -13.5 to use in Week 12 NFL picks, and while double-digit favorites are 10-1 straight up this season, they are just 6-5 ATS. One of those games whose spread falls in between the aforementioned extremes is Chiefs vs. Colts, which has another .500 team in Kansas City as 3.5-point favorites over an 8-2 Colts squad coming off a bye. All of the updated Week 12 NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Week 12 NFL picks now. LIMITED TIME: Use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1 JOIN NOW. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your initial $5 bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

Arizona is 6-1 ATS versus AFC opponents since 2024, which is the second-best spread record for any team in non-conference matchups. Meanwhile, the Jags are just 1-4 ATS this year outside of Jacksonville, and the takeaways that fueled their early success have nearly dried up. The Jaguars averaged 3.3 takeaways over their first four games but have averaged just 0.8 turnovers forced per game over their last six. Thus, extra offensive possessions for Arizona allow it to take advantage of the Jags' 26th-ranked passing defense, as Jacoby Brissett is projected to have more yards and touchdowns than Trevor Lawrence. With that, the Cardinals cover in over 50% of simulations. See which other teams to pick here.\nAnother one of its Week 12 NFL predictions: the Ravens (-13.5, 44.5) cover versus the Jets in well over 50% of simulations. New York is coming off a mini-bye, having played last Thursday, but there's no spread advantage with this rest edge. The Jets are 3-11-1 ATS over their last 15 games when they have a rest advantage over their opponent. Their Sunday opponent, Baltimore, has recently looked like the team most expected them to be all season as the Ravens have allowed just 14.8 points over their last five games. That includes a pair of games versus top-10 scoring offenses, but the team doesn't have to worry about seeing that with the Jets, who rank dead last in passing offense and 25th in scoring. Baltimore covers with points to spare, and the model also says the Over hits in nearly 80% of simulations. See which other teams to pick here.\nHow to make Week 12 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 12 NFL schedule and just revealed five teams projected to win by double-digits, potentially giving you a huge payday by playing the alternate lines.

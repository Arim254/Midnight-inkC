Miller Moss, who spent his last four seasons at USC and threw for 2,555 yards for the Trojans last year, has made the Cardinals one of the most consistent offenses in the nation by breaking 20 points in all nine games. He's thrown for 2,132 yards with 11 touchdowns this season. Star Louisville running back Isaac Brown will miss his second straight game, which means the Cardinals will likely rely on Miller even more on Friday. Meanwhile, Clemson quarterback Cade Klubnik has thrown for 2,136 yards with 14 touchdowns compared to five interceptions this season, and he's two weeks removed from throwing for 385 yards in a 45-point effort for the Tigers against Duke. The model projects the Over to hit in 54% of simulations. Back the Over at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Spurs to defeat the Warriors (-142)\"Am I a huge Steph Curry fan? Not really,\" SportsLine expert Matt Severance said. \"In many ways, he has ruined the NBA with his crazy pull-up/step-back 3-pointers because he is so gosh-darn amazing that everyone thinks they can do it. Do I think schematically Curry was good for basketball? Absolutely not. But I would argue he has changed the NBA, maybe more than Jordan has. My point is that Steph can win a game by himself. He did Wednesday on the Riverwalk with 46 points. It's just so hard to sweep one of these baseball-type series, though -- especially away. Remember, we were in this spot last Sunday with Orlando. With trepidation, I played the Magic to sweep Boston in a similar home/home type thing. They didn't.\" Back San Antonio at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Iowa (-15.5) vs. Xavier (-112)\"On the wrong end of an 86-67 scoreline vs Santa Clara on Monday actually flatters the Musketeers, who only picked up the pace in garbage time when Richard Pitino let transfer guard Roddie Anderson (ex-UCSD and Boise State) shoot to his heart's content in the second half, when he scored 25 of his 29 points,\" legendary SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall said. \"A more accurate barometer of the X came in the first two games when laboring past LeMoyne and Marist, and the first half vs. SCU when held to 20 points. Good things are expected at Iowa under new head coach Ben McCollum, who made Drake the rage of the Missouri Valley last season and has the Hawkeyes shooting out the lights (57% from the floor!) in the first two games.

    "body": "\n        Friday offers matinee NHL hockey courtesy of the Global Series as the Pittsburgh Penguins face the Nashville Predators with a 2 p.m. ET puck drop from Stockholm, Sweden. NHL Network has the telecast. There are a couple of Swedish players on both sides, and the teams will play again on Sunday. The Preds are the official home team today and are +105 underdogs with a total of 6.5 goals. I have a game wager and a player prop. Bet on Friday's Penguins vs. Predators game and more NHL action at bet365, where new users can get $200 in bonus bets after placing a first wager of $5 or more, regardless of whether or not that first bet wins:Penguins vs. Predators picksNashville +1 (-160) Filip Forsberg anytime goalscorer (+170)\nIn case you aren't a huge hockey person, it's important even in a neutral-site game to know which team is designated as the home side, because that club gets the last line change. That's definitely one reason why I'm on Nashville +1. Pittsburgh is better than expected early on with 21 points through 17 games, but the Stanley Cup title window has shut for the future Hall of Fame trio of Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang. That being said, Crosby (11 goals, eight assists ) and Malkin (three goals, 18 assists) are having solid seasons despite their advanced ages. Crosby is the +165 goal-scoring favorite today, just ahead of Filip Forsberg (+170).Despite that decent start, the Pens are still +20000 longshots to win the Cup, which are shorter odds than the Predators (+10000) even though Nashville only has 14 points in 18 games, sits last in the Central Division and likely won't even make the playoffs (+900 to get in).Perhaps the Penguins are coming back to earth as they have lost two straight and four of five, but the team is also incredibly banged up with the likes of No. 1 goalie Tristan Jarry and top-six forwards Rickard Rakell (Swedish) and Justin Brazeau among many players on injured reserve. Arturs Silovs (4-2-3, 2.49 GAA, .916 SV) should start in net today, and he has just one regulation loss in his past seven starts.Nashville enters on a five-game skid amid a bit of turmoil with Ryan O'Reilly recently publicly apologizing for a frustration-fueled postgame rant and major trade rumors swirling around the team, with the most mentioned name being future Hall of Famer Steven Stamkos.The Predators are much healthier than the Penguins, missing only the former Norris Trophy winner Josi and depth forward Cole Smith. It should be Juuse Saros (5-6-3, 3.11 GAA, .892 SV) in net, and he's at least much closer to his native Finland this weekend. Saros is a big reason why Nashville is struggling so badly. He was pulled Monday in a loss at the Rangers and has just one victory with a 3.72 GAA and .865 save in his past seven.Exactly half of all NHL regular-season games played outside North America have been decided by a one-goal margin or ended in a tie (23 of 46), including all four the last time games were played in Sweden. Pittsburgh swept Nashville last season with Crosby scoring two goals and adding four assists. The SportsLine Projection Model has Nashville winning in 53% of its simulations. I'm not a huge goalscorer props guy, but Swede Filip Forsberg, a longtime Nashville fixture, will be quite motivated to score in his native country. Oddly enough, all seven of his goals this season have come at home. And this is really home for Forsberg! \n            ",

Bet it at bet365 here:\nOver 44.5 in Oregon vs. MinnesotaOregon is approaching this number on its own this season, averaging 38.7 points per game. The Ducks have scored at least 50 points on three occasions, including a 56-10 win at Rutgers last month. Their offense is led by quarterback Dante Moore, who has 1,884 passing yards and 19 touchdowns. Minnesota gave up 41 points to Iowa at the end of October and 42 points to Ohio State at the beginning of October. The model has Oregon scoring 38 points on Friday night to help the Over cash in 69% of simulations. Bet Minnesota vs. Oregon at bet365 here:Knicks -6 vs. HeatNew York will be without star guard Jalen Brunson (ankle) after he got hurt on Wednesday, but Miami is in a much worse position as far as injuries. The Heat are without injured All-Stars Bam Adebayo (toe) and Tyler Herro (ankle). New York had won seven consecutive home games to open the season prior to its loss to Orlando on Wednesday, but that was the second game of a back-to-back. The Knicks went 11-6 without Brunson last season, and the Heat set season highs with 21 turnovers and 29 fouls in a loss to Cleveland, which was missing three starters. The model has the Knicks winning by double digits, covering the spread 63% of the time.\nUnder 231.5 in Pistons vs. 76ersDetroit and Philadelphia just met on Sunday, as the Pistons notched a 111-108 win in a low-scoring affair. The Pistons have three key players listed as game-time decisions in Isaiah Stewart, Cade Cunningham and Jalen Duren, while Ausar Thompson, Tobias Harris and Jaden Ivey are all out. Philadelphia will be playing without Joel Embiid and Paul George, so there will be significant offensive firepower missing on both rosters.

    "body": "\n        Notre Dame and Pittsburgh renew their rivalry for the first time in five years, squaring off for the 74th time and this time doing so with plenty of College Football Playoff implications. Notre Dame and Pitt are both inside the top 25 in the College Football Playoff Rankings, with the Fighting Irish checking in at No. 9 and Pitt moving up to No. 22 in the newest batch of rankings from the selection committee. Since both teams are 7-2 on the season, each game for the rest of the season puts CFP at-large chances on the line. The Panthers do have another path, as Pat Narduzzi's squad is 5-1 on the season in ACC play and will get a chance to remain in the conference title chase with upcoming games against fellow contenders Georgia Tech and Miami. Narduzzi himself pointed out the disconnect between this week's nonconference showdown and the key upcoming conference showdowns, so to think the Panthers are taking this top-10 opportunity lightly would be a mistake. This is the first ranked-on-ranked top-25 matchup that Pitt has hosted in the College Football Playoff era, and a chance to snap a four-game winning streak for Notre Dame in the series, which dates back to 1909. The Fighting Irish lead the all-time series 51-21-1, and Narduzzi has an 0-4 record against Notre Dame while Marcus Freeman has yet to face Pitt as a head coach.  Notre Dame vs. Pitt: Need to know  Notre Dame has dominated ACC foes: Marcus Freeman has faced an ACC opponent 16 times as Notre Dame's head coach, not counting games against Cal and Stanford during their Pac-12 era, and 14 times the Fighting Irish have come out on top. That 14-2 record against the ACC is on par with Notre Dame's all-time mark against the conference (222-84-3) and Saturday marks the first of three games against ACC opponents to close out the year. Notre Dame's path to the College Football Playoff has been narrow since an 0-2 start, but after seven straight wins it's helpful to have each remaining contest be a matchup against a league where the Fighting Irish have had a significant edge.  CJ Carr ranking among top quarterbacks in FBS: The star for redshirt freshman quarterback CJ Carr continues to rise through Notre Dame's winning streak, and he enters Week 12 with an argument as one of the most explosive passers in the country. Carr ranks first among all FBS quarterbacks in yards per pass attempt (10.11) and second among all freshman quarterbacks in passing touchdowns (19). He's also got the third-best pass efficiency rating of all quarterbacks (176.8), trailing only Ohio State's Julian Sayin and Indiana's Fernando Mendoza.   \nHonoring Aaron Donald: Pitt will be welcoming Panthers legend Aaron Donald to the game as a guest of honor, as Donald's No. 97 will be retired at halftime. Donald went 1-2 against the Fighting Irish during his college career, losing close three-point games in 2011 and 2012 before helping out with a sack in the 28-21 home win against Notre Dame in 2013. A Super Bowl champion and eight-time first-team All-Pro selection, Donald has certainly put together a Hall of Fame career that will include plenty of honors. But on Saturday it will be about his time with the Panthers, where he was an all-conference selection three years in a row across two different conferences, a unanimous All-American in 2013 and swept the awards circuit claiming honors for the Nagurski Award (best defensive player), Bednarik Award (best defensive player) and Outland Trophy (best interior offensive or defensive lineman).   Where to watch Notre Dame vs. Pitt live  Date: Saturday, Nov. 15 | Time: 12 p.m. ET  Location: Acrisure Stadium -- Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania  TV: ABC | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)  Notre Dame vs. Pitt prediction, picks  \nTen of the last 14 meetings in this series have been decided by single-digits, and with Aaron Donald in the house it's easy to get the vibes like Pitt is set up to be frisky and threaten for the upset. Pitt may not be able to get enough stops against CJ Carr to win, but with Mason Heintschel leading the way the Panthers can score enough to hang around. Pick: Pitt +12.5 \n\n                    \n

Since its inception, it has generated a betting profit of over $2,000 for $100 players on its top-rated college spread football picks. Anyone following its college football betting advice at sportsbooks and on betting apps could have seen huge returns.  Friday's college football best bets at BetMGMOver 51.5 points in Louisville vs. Clemson (-105)Minnesota +25.5 vs. Oregon (-110)Over 44.5 points in Oregon vs. Minnesota (-105)Combining these three picks into a Friday parlay at BetMGM would result in a payout of +628 (risk $100 to win $628). Bet it at BetMGM Sportsbook here:\nOver 51.5 in Louisville vs. Clemson (-105)A pair of overtime losses are all that stand between Louisville and an unbeaten season. Now, Louisville enters a bizarro world where Clemson might be a lookahead game with SMU lurking. That's enough to avoid the spread here, but the total here is alluring. There has been at least 55 points scored in five of Louisville's six home games and the model predicts that the Over hits here in 55% of simulations. Back the Over at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Minnesota +25.5 vs. Oregon (-110)Oregon still has an inside track on a CFP berth, but there's been a lot done to erode confidence in the last couple of months. The double-overtime win at Penn State that seemingly cemented the Ducks as a contender turned out to be false mirrors, then they suffered a home loss to Indiana and barely survived Iowa last week. Minnesota took beatings at the hands of Iowa and Ohio State, but this is too wide a margin with Oregon in survival mode. The Golden Gophers cover in 60% of simulations. Back Minnesota at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Over 44.5 in Oregon vs. Minnesota (-105)Iowa was able to drag Oregon into the muck, but the Hawkeyes do that to everybody. This is too low a total to involve a team that averages 38.7 points per game on its own (Ducks). The Minnesota offense has struggled all year, but only realistically needs to contribute 10-14 points here to tip this in our direction. The model predicts that the Over hits in 68% of simulations and it's one of this week's A-rated picks.\nWant Week 11 NFL picks?You've seen some of the model's best bets for Friday.

    "body": "\n        The New York Knicks will take the court without Jalen Brunson on Friday for the first time this season, as the team's star point guard suffered an ankle injury on Wednesday. However, no other New York player was listed on the morning injury report, meaning the Knicks should still have talented players such as Karl-Anthony Towns, OG Anunoby and Mikal Bridges, enough for the SportsLine Projection Model to make the Knicks to cover as 5.5-point favorites as one of its early best sports bets in a 7 p.m. ET contest.The model is also backing Illinois State to cover as 16.5-point underdogs against USC in college basketball, and one of SportsLine's top experts has a pick on Louisville vs. Clemson in college football in its Friday early best bets. Click here to bet today's games with the latest bet365 promo code, which gives new users $200 in bonus bets with a $5 wager, whether it wins or loses:Whether you're looking into NBA betting, college football betting, college basketball betting, or anything else on the Friday sports schedule, there are a number of online sports betting options, and our team can help point you in the right direction.

Bet it at FanDuel here:Friday NBA best bets Game: Miami Heat vs. New York KnicksThe Pick: Knicks -5.5 (-110)The Knicks are 7-4 this season, including 7-1 at home, as they host the Heat on Friday. Even with Jalen Brunson (ankle) out, the Knicks have enough talent to win and cover the spread in this one, led by Karl-Anthony Towns, who is averaging 20.2 points and 12.6 rebounds per game this season. The Knicks won all three head-to-head meetings against Miami last season, including their only home matchup by 21 points. The model projects the Knicks to cover in 63% of simulations.Use the latest FanDuel promo code, where new users receive $150 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: More NBA best betsEvery NBA game simulated 10,000 timesFriday college basketball best bets Game: Illinois State Redbirds vs. USC Trojans (7 p.m. ET)The Pick: Illinois State +16.5 (-112)Illinois State can't compete with USC in brand appeal, but the Redbirds are coming off a 22-win season, and they return their top two scorers from last year's successful team. Chase Walker, a 6-foot-7 junior forward, led Illinois in scoring (15.2 ppg) and rebounds (6.2 per game) last season, while junior guard Johnny Kinziger was second in scoring at 14.6 ppg. USC lost its top three leading scorers from last year as a new lineup is still developing chemistry in the early parts of the season. The model views 16.5 points as simply too many points to give a team with returning top talent from a 20-win season, as the model projects Illinois State to cover the spread in 75% of simulations.\nMore college basketball best betsEvery college basketball game simulated 10,000 timesFriday college football best bets Game: Clemson Tigers vs. Louisville Cardinals (7:30 p.m. ET)The Pick: Clemson +2.5 (-108\"It's been a disappointing campaign for Dabo Swinney's Clemson, sitting only 4-5 into tonight. Yet the Tigers have been better since a late-September bye...as long as QB Cade Klubnik is available, which he will be Friday night,\" legendary SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall said. \"Dabo's boys also have revenge on their minds after last year's 33-21 home loss to the Cards. Ever since the rousing upset at Miami in mid-October, the 'Ville has looked flat, laboring vs. heavy underdogs BC and VPI before losing outright at home last week to near-three TD dog California. As he did last season at USC when a fast start in September preceded getting benched in November, Card QB Miller Moss has seen his effectiveness plummet as this season progresses.\"Bet Clemson vs. Louisville on FanDuel to get $150 in bonus bets if your first $5 wager wins:More college football betsEvery  game simulated 10,000 times\n            ",

    "body": "\n        On Sunday, a new USL League One champion will be crowned as One Knoxville SC takes on the Spokane Velocity on the CBS Sports Golazo network. While both are newer teams in the American soccer landscape, they're showing that success can come quickly if groundwork is laid. And both are doing it in different ways. For the Velocity, this is already their second consecutive appearance in the USL League in the final despite only being two years old as a club, while Knoxville are doing their damage under a first-year head coach as the club continues to improve.The Velocity needed a dramatic finish in the semifinals, with Nil Vinyals scoring in the 121st minute of play to send the match to a penalty shootout. When it went to the shootout, starting goalkeeper Carlos Merancio told the team that they would win, and with a strong performance by him in net, they did just that.It was a slightly simpler process for Ian Fuller's One Knoxville with the team riding a 66th-minute goal by Kempes Tekiela to victory over FC Naples, and now they'll get to play this final in front of their home fans, where they've rode strong support all season long. There are plenty of similarities between each team with how they embrace the communities that they represent, but on Sunday, they'll square off as rivals.How to watch One Knoxville vs. Spokane VelocityDate: Sunday, Nov. 16 | Time: 5 p.m. ETLocation: Regal Stadium -- Knoxville, TennesseeLive stream: CBS Sports GolazoA growing power When Spokane started play last season, no one expected them to make it to the League One final, and while they were able to ride fan support to that, before coming up short against Union Omaha, this season they're back, and they feel like they belong. In year two, some of the shine has worn off with the club no longer being new in town but with attendance rebounding during the season as fans came out to support a team that came up just short of breaking the USL record for the fewest losses in a season, it's clear that they're representatives for Spokane in a town where Gonzaga are king and they're surpassing even themselves with that success.\n\"Earlier this year, we had a season ticket member event, and a group of fans came over, and originally, there was no real soccer team in Spokane. There was no professional team. They tried back in the day, but it didn't quite work out. So this is the real like real go at having a pro team here, and one of the fans, sort of a group of the fans, walked up to me and said that you've made Spokane the soccer city,\" Velocity head coach Leigh Veidman said. \"That comment in itself, I think weighed everything up for me. And then you see the attendance and the energy that we get in the last two home playoff games. I mean, you feel that Spokane is a soccer city now, so it's, it's been fantastic.\"It's a sentiment echoed by fans of the club through and through, from calling the win over Portland Hearts of Pine one of the greatest sporting events that they've seen, to also giving them something in Spokane that's uniquely theirs. While Veidman doesn't know if they'll ever reach Gonzaga levels of support in the city, it's clear that the club is on to something, and it's being backed up on and off the pitch.\"The people of Spokane feel proud of their city, and that's not easily come by. Civic pride can sometimes be a challenging topic,\" Spokane soccer show host Benji Wade said. \"As somebody who loves soccer and loves Spokane, I couldn't feel more proud. That's really what it comes back to, and I don't use that word lightly.\"\nAhead of this second consecutive final, the energy is lighter around the club because they've been here before. No longer is this a new team in League One, but instead it's a club that has hit the ground running and produced success from day one, a feat that is quite hard to accomplish, but that also brings pressure as well because they want to win this final while giving their fans more to be proud of along the way.Even how teams approached playing the Velocity this season was different due to their success, which led to an evolution in how they played. \"I know a lot of teams adapted to us a little bit more this year, just style wise, right? I feel like last year, every time we were obviously kind of like the underdogs in a way, and now we were kind of the team to beat for quite a bit,\"  midfielder Luis Gil said.\nEven in this final, it was One Knoxville who won the league behind a stout defense while finishing with a plus 17 goal difference. The Velocity may not truly be coming into this match as underdogs in comparison to their last shot at this title, but similarities are there.A head coach on the rise\nComing into a new club as a head coach is already a tough task, but that's the case even more so when it's your first head coaching job, like what Ian Fuller has experienced with One Knoxville. An experienced soccer player and seasoned assistant, spending time with the Charleston Battery, Orlando City SC, and Minnesota United, Fuller was ready to try his hand at a head coaching job and took over One Knoxville in December of 2024. There were adjustments to the players getting used to his style, but once they hit their stride with a defense anchored by the defender of the year, Jordan Skelton, it has been quite a ride for Fuller and the team while also enduring some bumps in the road while getting here.\n\"It's just great to see that they've taken the chance that they've been given here, and that's all you want is, you know, to give players chances and to see them grow, not only individually, but these guys are so tight,\" Fuller said. \"They love each other, and for them to win together is awesome to see. You know, for me individually, it's been a really hard year. You know, my wife's battling breast cancer, and it's been a hard year, and to win your first year is really, really hard. But to win the way we've had to fight my wife and I, it would mean a lot.\"The club has been unbelievable, I have to say. And the support that the people have given us, you know, it's made my wife's fight even stronger, and so I would be remiss to not give the club a lot of credit for being so wonderful,\" Fuller continued.Community has meant a lot to both of these clubs, and that's a bit of the nature of lower division soccer. One Knoxville shares their stadium with the Knoxville Smokies in Double-A baseball, something that shows how unique the environment is where these games are taking place. There are travel challenges to manage, but they also help make a tight knit squad and add to the community buy in for a side like this.\n\"The travel is, I'm not saying more difficult than Major League Soccer, but you certainly have the finer airplanes, not as many stops on the road, and seven hour bus trips. But I grew up in this atmosphere playing so I was very familiar and I knew the challenges, but it's a very difficult league. You don't have an easy match,\" Fuller said ahead of the playoffs on CBS Sports Golazo's Morning Footy.Even with those challenges, One Knoxville have looked to improve year after year, and both players and fans are taking notice of those.\"It's a club that from day one, felt like they were taking steps forward. You know, trying to build, trying to progress and I know firsthand that that's not the case with every League One club,\" Skelton said. \"So to be part of one that does have a bit of a plan for longevity, and not only longevity, but to progress and improve, not just survive, is obviously you feel that as a player and it just lets you have trust in where you are.\"\nAs USL builds toward massive changes, looking to introduce promotion and relegation in 2028, this is a final that can showcase some of the best that the lower divisions have to offer. Two ambitious clubs who are representing their communities well, investing in their facilities and putting their best foot forward on and off the pitch, come together in an even tie, but someone will have to come out on top on Sunday.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The New England Patriots are currently the hottest team in the NFL. Following their 27-14 win over the New York Jets on Thursday night, the Patriots (9-2) have now won eight straight games, which is the longest active winning streak in the league. It's a far cry from where the Patriots were at this point last season: 3-8 after 11 games. This year, they've already clinched a winning record, which means they're guaranteed to finish above .500 for the first time since 2021. The biggest difference is Mike Vrabel. After going 4-13 last season, the Patriots dumped Jerod Mayo after just one year so they could hire Vrabel, and the gamble has definitely paid off. With the win over the Jets, Vrabel became just the third coach since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970 to take over a team that won five games or less in the previous season and lead them on a winning streak of at least eight games in his first year on the job. Let's take a look at the three coaches who have pulled that off: Coach (year, team)Record before coach's arrivalWinning streak in coach's first yearFinal recordTed Marchibroda (1975 Colts)2-12 in 1974Nine games10-4Andy Reid (2013 Chiefs)2-14 in 2012Nine games11-5Mike Vrabel (2025 Patriots)4-13 in 2024Eight games and counting??-??Vrabel could tie Reid and Marchibroda for the longest winning streak if the Patriots pull off a victory in Week 12 over the Bengals. The Patriots' eight-game winning streak is the team's longest since 2019 when Tom Brady was still in New England. Vrabel did set one record with the win on Thursday, and that's the mark for best 11-game start (9-2) by a coach who inherited a team that lost 13 games or more in the previous season. Not only did the Patriots go 4-13 last year, but they also went 4-13 in 2023. With their 9-2 start, they're just the second team in NFL history to start a year 9-2 or better after consecutive seasons with 13 losses or more. The only other team to pull that off was the 1999 Indianapolis Colts. The Colts went 3-13 in 1997, which earned them the No. 1 overall pick in the 1998 NFL Draft, and they used the pick on someone you might know: Peyton Manning. Although the Colts struggled to a 3-13 record during Manning's rookie year, they went 13-3 in 1999, which included a 9-2 start. Just like those Colts, the Patriots also have a quarterback (Drake Maye) who's in his second season. The 23-year-old has been playing football at an MVP level through 11 weeks. (Maye is in the midst of one of the greatest Year 2 leaps by a QB in NFL history, and we broke that down here.)\n        \n            \n                Grading NFL QBs on rookie deals: Drake Maye is acing the 2025 season while two others are flunking out\n                \n                    Mike Renner                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIf you look at Vrabel's track record as a head coach, he's had plenty of success, but he's never had a franchise QB. Despite that, he led the Titans to the playoffs three times during his six seasons, including an AFC title game appearance in 2019. He also led Tennessee to the No. 1 overall seed during a 2021 season where he was voted NFL Coach of the Year. How impressive was it for Vrabel to lead the Titans to the top seed that year? Since Patrick Mahomes' first year as a starter in 2018, only three coaches have led their team to a No. 1 overall seed in the AFC: Andy Reid (four times), John Harbaugh (two times) and Vrabel (once). Reid has had Mahomes. Harbaugh has had Lamar Jackson. Vrabel did it with Tannehill, who was out of the NFL just two years later. The reason that's worth mentioning is because Vrabel has the Patriots in the hunt for the No. 1 overall seed this year. According to our playoff projections, the Patriots are currently projected to get the top seed in the AFC, and a big reason for that is because they have the second-easiest remaining strength of schedule in the NFL. Over their final six games, they only play one team that currently has a winning record (Bills in Week 15). Vrabel has changed the culture in just one year, and his players seem to love playing for him. \nWith a seasoned head coach, a franchise quarterback and a strong defense, the Patriots seem to have what it takes to play late into January this year and possibly into February. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        BYU transfer guard Kennard Davis Jr., the No. 56 ranked transfer prospect in the 2025 class and a starter for No. 7 BYU, was arrested in Provo, Utah, on Thursday morning on suspicion of DUI after being involved in a two-car crash. He sustained minor injuries and was transported to the Provo Police Department for further investigation.The driver of the other vehicle involved in the crash was not injured.After conducting an investigation into the crash, the Provo Police said in a statement that they found cause to place Davis, 20, under arrest for suspected DUI. He was cited for a DUI charge and released for medical treatment, and his vehicle was impounded.Davis did not play in Tuesday's game for BYU vs. Delaware -- an 85-68 win for the Cougars -- after starting the first two contests in wins over Villanova and Holy Cross. He averaged 9.0 points, 1.5 assists and shot 50% on 4-of-8 from 3-point range in the two games in which he appeared.BYU acknowledged the allegations on Thursday and said it is looking into the situation.\nWhat it means for BYUIt is unclear why Davis did not play in BYU's game Tuesday vs. Delaware, but he has so far this season been an integral piece for a team that is among the most talented in program history. A Southern Illinois transfer, he averaged 16.3 points and shot 37.6% from 3-point range last season for the Salukis.In two games this season, Davis was fourth on the team in scoring and No. 1 in 3-point shooting percentage. He is also second on the team in field goal percentage at 58.3% and yet to commit a turnover in 54 minutes of action. Davis is also regarded as maybe BYU's best perimeter defender.The incident comes at a critical time for BYU, which faces No. 3 UConn on Saturday in what is shaping up to be one of the biggest nonconference games of the early 2025-26 college basketball season. The Cougars flew into Boston on Thursday, and it is unclear if Davis traveled with the team.\nShould he miss the game, as was the case earlier in the week, BYU will likely continue to give heavy backcourt minutes to the trio of Robert Wright, Richie Saunders and Dawson Baker -- along with star recruit AJ Dybantsa in a combo forward spot. Wright and Baker saw the biggest spikes in minutes and usage in the Delaware game, playing 36 and 25 minutes, respectively. Wright delivered with 26 points, nine rebounds and nine assists, while Baker added six rebounds and three points in the win.\n            ",

He was taken to a hospital, and officials have not released his condition. The college was placed on lockdown shortly after the shooting.\"My thoughts are with coach John Beam and his loved ones,\" Oakland Mayor Barbara Lee shared in a statement. \"We are praying for him.  Coach Beam is a giant in Oakland -- a mentor, an educator and a lifeline for thousands of young people. For over 40 years, he has shaped leaders on and off the field, and our community is shaken alongside his family.\"Beam, 66, became a nationally recognized figure after Last Chance U chronicled Laney's 2019 season. Before retiring as coach in 2024 and moving into the athletic director position, he led the program to two league championships and a 2018 state title, a season in which Laney finished 11-2 and was ranked the top community college team in the country. He also maintained a 90% graduation and transfer rate for his players, according to CBS News.\nBeam's legacy in Oakland extends to Skyline High School, where he coached for 16 years and won 11 section and 15 league championships before joining Laney. The shooting involving Beam unfolded a day after a Skyline High School student was injured in gunfire on that campus.Acting Oakland police chief James Beere told reporters the incident involving Beam appeared to be isolated and not related to the previous shooting. The suspect was described as a male wearing a hoodie, and investigators have not identified a motive.\n\"This is the second shooting on an Oakland campus in two days, and it is devastating,\" Lee said in the statement. \"Schools should be the safest spaces in our city. We need guns off our streets now.  We are standing together, praying for coach Beam and his loved ones.\"\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Eleven more NFL games are set for Sunday afternoon either in the 1 p.m. ET or 4:05/4:25 p.m. ET window, and those matchups comprise the main slate for NFL DFS sites like FanDuel and DraftKings. One of the early kickoffs -- Bengals vs. Steelers-- has the highest over/under (49.5) for the week, so that game should be a focus for NFL daily Fantasy players with big names like Josh Allen, Ja'Marr Chase and James Cook in action. Other big names expected to be playing on the main slate include Justin Herbert, Bijan Robinson and Christian McCaffrey. How should they factor into your NFL DFS picks this week, and who are the sleepers in the NFL DFS player pool that can help differentiate your lineups?

Playing in a more run-centric Jim Harbaugh offense limited his Fantasy production last year, but a rash of injuries at running back has Los Angeles throwing the ball more in 2025 with Ladd McConkey, Keenan Allen, Quentin Johnston and tight end Oronde Gadsden II all putting up big numbers. Herbert and the Chargers face the Jaguars, who have given up the second-most Fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks this season. See who else to pick here.The optimizer's NFL DFS strategy also includes building around Atlanta receiver Drake London at $8,400 on FanDuel and $7,400 on DraftKings. The fourth-year pro is pacing for career-best number across the board as he enters Week 11 with a 53-691-6 receiving line. He faces a tougher matchup against a Carolina defense that has been solid overall against the pass. London, however, dominated the Panthers in their second meeting last year, posting a massive 10-187-2 line, giving hi huge upside at a value price on Sunday. You can see the rest of the optimizer's NFL DFS picks here.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to build Sunday Week 11 NFL DFS lineupsThe NFL DFS Optimizer is also targeting multiple undervalued players who could explode for huge numbers on Sunday.

    "description": "\n        FRISCO, Texas -- The Dallas Cowboys returned to their regular meetings and practice schedule on Thursday following 24-year-old edge rusher Ma",
    "body": "\n        FRISCO, Texas -- The Dallas Cowboys returned to their regular meetings and practice schedule on Thursday following 24-year-old edge rusher Marshawn Kneeland's Nov. 6 death by a self-inflicted gunshot, still processing the sudden reality that he's no longer here.  Cowboys defensive tackle Osa Odighizuwa, one of two Dallas players who spoke at the Tuesday night candlelight vigil for Kneeland along with defensive tackle Solomon Thomas, is trying to come to grips that Kneeland is gone.\"It's just crazy. It's still something that I'm trying to wrap my head around. I was at my locker before practice, and I looked up and I felt like I saw him, and 'Ah nah, that's someone else.' It hits you, you know what I mean?\" Odighizuwa said on Thursday. \"Just moments like that. It's still sinking in, to be honest. It still doesn't feel all the way real.\"Dallas wide receiver Ryan Flournoy, a 2024 sixth-round pick who entered the NFL with Kneeland as the second-round pick of their draft class, was shocked when he found out. The draft classmates became tight since Flournoy and his wife Kalei went on double dates with Kneeland and his girlfriend Catalina Mancera.  \n\"It was shocking, honestly. The bye week everybody [at] home just waking up and hearing that news is shocking, honestly. A lot of y'all know me and Marshawn came in together as rookies. So my wife and his girl became close. We went on double dates,\" Flournoy said on Thursday. \"I'm just thinking 'man, [all the] times we went on double dates, I just wish I would have told him you got to wait on God no matter how hard life gets. Just turn to God because I'm a witness.' I've read it in the Bible, and I've witnessed it in [my] life. May he rest in peace. All I could do is just pray for him for sure.\"  When dealing with suicide, those close to the person who is now gone can sometimes spend plenty of time racking their brains about if they missed any signs or what could have been done differently. That thought process, no matter how unfair it is to those still around, is happening in Dallas. \"Of course. Those questions are natural. You try not to think about them but when you're having very open and authentic conversations with these guys, the pain is real. The questions are real,\" Cowboys coach Brian Schottenheimer said. \"But again the more you talk to the experts, the people that deal with this all the time, they say a lot of times you're never going to know. So but I'd be lying if I said to you I don't wake up in the middle of the night or when I'm on the phone talking to one of those guys [Cowboys players], and have those thoughts. You do.\"\nFor all the time Flournoy spent with Kneeland, he never saw any warning signs. \"No signs at all. Just a happy guy, just always smiling, always cracking jokes, dancing, playing a lot,\" Flournoy said. \"You would never know it, and that's why it's crazy, shocking.\"Odighizuwa said he's seen Kneeland get frustrated, as everyone does, but nothing that could have indicated he would be speaking about Kneeland's death. \"I've seen him get upset before, and that's why I know, Marshawn was a sensitive guy,\" Odighizuwa said. \"I know everything was 110% with him, even his emotions. When he got upset, he would be very upset. That was kind of the most that I knew.\"\nThomas also didn't see any signs, but he's well aware that doesn't mean someone isn't struggling with their mental health. Thomas lost his sister, Ella, to suicide at the age of 24, the same age Kneeland was, back in 2018. \"Marshawn was in the building, smiling everyday. He was happy he was listening to music. He was dancing all the time, but that's the thing with mental health and suicide. You just never know what someone's going through, someone could be smiling, someone could be dancing, laughing, having a great time expressing all this joy, but inside, they could really be fighting the battle that you never know about. You don't know what the chemicals are telling them in their brain. You don't know the trauma from their childhood,\" Thomas said on Thursday.\"You don't know everything they've been going through, and that's why it's so important to be kind. It's so important to ask people how they're doing. It's so important to tell people the resources around them that therapy is okay, as a man, therapy is okay, as a woman like, these are these things that we are that we need to go through because you never know what battle someone's going through. It's just, it's hard, it's tragic. Such a young life that should be here. ... If you look at the mental health statistics, they start at the age of nine, like kids are dying by nine to suicide, like it's something our whole nation needs to take seriously. .... It's such a preventable death, and we just need as a nation to come together. Be kind. Put more funding into mental health resources. Help people get to therapy and let people know it's okay to cry. Let people know it's okay to not always put a smile on and be good.\"\nDallas quarterback Dak Prescott, like Thomas, is unfortunately familiar with suicide too since he lost his brother Jace to it in 2020. He also never saw signs that Kneeland was struggling, which is why he is emphasizing that everyone put more into knowing people beyond the surface.  \"Yeah, guilt is tricky. Guilt is one of those things that when those thoughts come in, that's where you first have to counteract and counter thoughts. To go off of what Solomon said, 'yeah, there were no signs.' Respect to the family, they don't want to go down and tag this as mental health. With that being said, yeah there were no signs,\" Prescott said Thursday. \"I crossed him a lot, passed him a lot through the hot tub, through the cold tub, through the training room and far opposite of any signs. There was never really isolation. There wasn't a time that Marshawn wasn't talking, wasn't open or putting smiles on people's faces. So it's tough to even talk to these two things hand in hand. For me, it's a moment of a cup run over. That's why it's important for us to connect, just communicate, talk, vent and just try to get things off our plates as much as we can and just be there even when you feel like you're not. Your presence matters.\"Guilt and grief can sometimes turn to anger, which is an emotion Prescott finds himself dealing with in times like these. That's when he leans on the training he and his teammates have received from team psychologist Dr. Heather Twedel and other mental health professionals the Cowboys brought in to speak with players over the last week. His key takeaways from those sessions are to be vulnerable and let everything out in order to actually process and work through whatever emotions are bubbling up inside. \n\"Obviously me and Solly have been through this, but I'll be the first to say, I may be the champion of speaking up but I'm not necessarily the champion of dealing with grief, I guess you can say. I can say I'm a champion of moving forward and past it and using it as your source of strength,\" Prescott said. ... \"I get angry a lot. The best way is when I get angry or I get sad in those moments, I think about 'how can I counteract that?' Usually, it's 'how can I make somebody smile or how can I do something better?' So just little things like that have been helpful. I know they've been helpful to me. ... I've taken a lot from those conversations from O2X, from Doctor T [team psychologist Dr. Heather Twedel], from the professionals and have brought them into smaller conversations as we've had breakouts or just hot tub talk or conversations at lunch. It's just the more we can talk, the more we can connect, that's the only good in this honestly at this moment. Reminds us how important it is to not just know these jersey numbers, but to know the family and to know things beyond this building.\"     \n            ",

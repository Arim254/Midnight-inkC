    "body": "\n        The final international break of 2025 has come to an end, and with that period passing, we'll have uninterrupted club soccer until March. That brings a good time to reflect as the Premier League is through 11 matches, which is a chance to begin looking at trends around the league. But while some things, such as Arsenal, Manchester City, and Chelsea occupying three of the top four stages at this stage were expected, what are some of the bigger surprises around the league?From Arsenal to Tottenham, we've got you covered in taking a look at some things that stick out, and if they're sustainableLiverpool's defense can't hold upWhile it shouldn't come as a surprise that Father Time has seemingly caught up with Mohamed Salah at 33, the demise of Liverpool's defense is something to look into. The Reds had one of the best team defenses in the league last campaign, and they've now allowed 17 goals in only 11 matches. So many changes have been made to Arne Slot's defense, with Trent Alexander-Arnold leaving for Real Madrid and Milos Kerkez coming in to start over Andrew Robertson, and that has unsettled everything. Looking at the Reds defend this season, they seem like a shell of theirsleves and the title defense backs that up. This early in the season, they already trail Arsenal by a whopping eight points, and that's a gap that's probably going to be too much to close. It'd be one thing if it were just trailing the Gunners, but sitting in eighth in the league, they'd have to pass so many sides who can put in more consistent performances. On their day, Liverpool can still defeat Real Madrid, but they can also lose to anyone as well. Consistency wins titles, and with this defense, Liverpool lack that.Golden Boot chaser, Igor Thiago?Seeing that Erling Haaland is leading the league with 14 goals in 11 matches isn't a major surprise, but looking behind him at the Golden Boot standings may reveal a few. One is Igor Thiago as Brentford may have unearthed another gem. After losing their manager Thomas Frank and star attackers Bryan Mbuemo and Yoane Wissa, the Bees were expected to be bound for a relegation battle this season, but forward Igor Thiago has fired them into midtable with eight goals this season. He's not shooting at an absurdly high rate with 25 shots in 11 matches, and he is overperforming a bit with eight goals from an expected goal tally of 5.66. That's not worrisome though, because good finishers do outperform their xG. Only 24, and having netted an 18-goal season at Club Brugge before making the swap to Brentford last season, this is something that could be legit. Going back to Ollie Watkins and Ivan Toney, finding forwards is what Brentford does, and its happening again right now.\nThe Black Cats are backSunderland's return to the Premier League was a great moment after the club bottomed out in League One, but looking at their transfers, while Granit Xhaka was a good addition from Bayer Leverkusen, the expectation was this team could be good if given time, but might struggle out of the gate. Regis Le Bris has proven that time wasn't needed to push Sunderland into a top four place heading into the international break. Robin Roefs has anchored a solid defense, center back Daniel Ballard is outperforming top strikers in the league, and the Black Cats are flying high. Goal difference is historically something to point to on if a team will stay in the top four, and with a goal difference of only four, it's unlikely that that's in Sunderland's future, but a finish in the top half is. And if things keep turning up their way, there's no reason why they can't end up in a European spot either.Tottenham can't keep getting away with this Center back Mickey Van De Ven is the top scorer on the team with six goals in all competitions. Set pieces have been critical under Thomas Frank, and the defense has improved by leaps and bounds this season. Tottenham's floor is very high with these two things keeping them up, but as the first North London Derby of the season with Arsenal looms, so do their flaws. They've gotten almost nothing from key signings Mohammed Kudus and Xavi Simons, who have one goal and five Premier League assists between them. They've also lacked any output from their strikers and struggled to move the ball up the pitch via their midfield. It's a team that seems stagnant more often than not, yet it's working for some reason. Frank does need time, considering that the ideas are there, but it's also clear that if one team had to be looked at for overperforming, it's right here.The Tricky Trees tumbleThis is an issue of Nottingham Forest's own creation. This was a team expected to take a step back due to not having depth and competing in Europe, but the relegation zone was not supposed to be their fate. Suddenly Moving on from manager Nuno Espirito Santo was a surprise alone, but then going to his polar opposite in Ange Postecoglou was jarring in the worst way. It's now onto Sean Dyche, the team's third manager of the year before Christmas, to pull this team out of the relegation zone despite him not being able to balance attacking and defending in the way that Espirito Santo did. With a true star in the side in Elliot Anderson, this is a team who should be quite balanced, but everything from the top is keeping them from hitting form. The league phase of the Europa League can't end fast enough because while this team is too good to get relegated, if they don't lose the extra burden of fixture congestion soon, things could get interesting. \nWhat in the NewcastleLosing Alexander Isak was always going to be a blow, but in Sando Tonali, Joelinton, and Bruno Guimaraes, the Magpies arguably have the best midfield in the Premier League. Defensively, they're showing only allowing 14 goals in 11 games, but when it comes to the attack, nothing is working with them, only scoring 12 goals in 11 games. Maybe they're putting all their eggs in the Champions League basket? Looking at European competition, Eddie Howe's side are a different outfit. Sitting sixth in the league phase, they've scored 10 goals and allowed two in four matches. That performance can allow the Premier League to be overlooked for now, but when that comes to an end, form will need to pick up. It's clear that Newcastle have the talent to jump up the table, but as things become more jumbled by the day, that will be quite tough to do. It's important to balance multiple competitions, and if that doesn't happen, it could lead to a sticky situation that Howe can't get out of.\n            ",

Man City has won four in a row and sits second behind Arsenal in the EPL standings, while Newcastle has lost three of five and sits 14th. Kickoff from St. James' Park is set for 12:30 p.m. ET. Newcastle are +260 money line underdogs in the latest BetMGM Sportsbook odds while Man City are -102 money line favorites. A draw comes in at +260 and the total sits at 2.5 (Over -150, Under +110). The SportsLine Projection Model has Manchester City winning in 46% of simulations to bring value at these odds.

He's currently leading the golden boot race in Premier League play and has already picked up 14 goals over his 11 starts for the club this season. He's already scored against the best defenses in the league, and he will be looking to return from scoring for Norway to start scoring for his club again. He's also currently one goal away from a pretty remarkable milestone. His next goal will be his 100th EPL goal, and if he scores against Newcastle, he would have accomplished that in just 109 appearances. Expect Haaland to be charging the goal for 90 minutes straight. Manchester City momentum Liverpool is crumbling right now, Arsenal are prepping for the North London Derby and Manchester City are lurking. Right before international break, Manchester City really started to turn up the gas. They wiped the floor with Liverpool 3-0, ran over Dortmund in UCL play 4-1 and outscored both Bournemouth and Swansea 3-1. This team is firing on all cylinders and the break will just have made them stronger. I know playing Newcastle at home is now joke, but City is welcoming back players from injury and should be looking to pick up right where they left off knowing Arsenal could very well drop points this weekend. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 Serie A season is in full swing in Italy. Napoli started the campaign as defending champions after winning the 2024-25 title, their fourth Scudetto ever on the last matchday of the season. Inter, Juventus and AC Milan will compete with the team coached by Antonio Conte to win the Serie A title, while other teams such as AS Roma, Atalanta, Lazio, Fiorentina, Bologna and Como are all in contention for a spot in next season's European tournaments.This weekend's Serie A slate features some huge battles, highlighted by AC Milan facing Inter on Sunday: Here's what to know.Leao speaks to Morning Footy Speaking to Morning Footy on CBS Sports Golazo Network, Rafael Leao spoke ahead of the Derby della Madonnina against Inter that will take place on Sunday at San Siro.\"The coach doesn't ask me many things, he just told me: 'be free,' and the most important thing is to stay focused and have the right mentality, because he knows what I can do with the ball and that I can help the team even without the ball. He's more like a father asking his son to always do better at school and in life, to do things the right way. I feel happy and very confident in every game because I know he's counting on me. He just asks me to stay focused even after a goal, to not stop.\"\nLeao is expected to start alongside USMNT Christian Pulisic in the attack for the first time since August 16, as injuries affected both players so far this season.\"To be honest, I like one-on-one situations, dribbling past one, two, or three defenders, but we know football has changed, and statistics matter too. I don't really like them. I grew up watching Robinho, Ronaldinho, Quaresma, and Cristiano, and those types of players excite me, seeing what they do on the pitch. Pulisic? \"I think he's changed. When I saw him at Chelsea and Borussia Dortmund, he was a winger who liked to dribble, one-on-one, go from one side to the other, with a lot of skill. Christian understands what I was talking about earlier about the evolution of football and statistics. He's a player with great qualities, but he's also very intelligent, and in that position, where he plays now, as a number ten, he knows how to move, and when I play with him, I try to help him and create space for him.\"\nHow to watch Inter vs. AC Milan, oddsDate: Sunday, Nov. 23 | Time: 2:45 p.m. ETLocation: San Siro -- Milan Live stream: Paramount+Odds: Inter -109; Draw +244; AC Milan +293How to watch Serie A Matchday 12All times U.S./EasternSaturday, November 22Udinese vs. Bologna, 9 a.m. (Paramount+)Cagliari vs. Genoa, 9 a.m. (Paramount+)Fiorentina vs. Juventus, 12 p.m. (Paramount+)Napoli vs. Atalanta, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)Sunday, November 23Hellas Verona vs. Parma, 6:30 a.m. (Paramount+)Cremonese vs. AS Roma, 9 a.m. (Paramount+)Lazio vs. Lecce, 12 p.m. (Paramount+)Inter vs. AC Milan, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)Monday, November 24Torino vs. Como, 6:30 a.m. (Paramount+)Sassuolo vs. Pisa, 9 a.m. (Paramount+)\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Survivor Series: WarGames has a blockbuster main event. The WarGames stipulation returns for the fourth consecutive year with CM Punk, Roman Reigns, Cody Rhodes, Jey Uso, Brock Lesnar and Logan Paul in the mix.Since 2022, WWE has replaced the traditional four vs. four or five vs. five Survivor Series matches with WarGames, a legendary stipulation invented by \"The American Dream\" Dusty Rhodes. This year, world heavyweight champion Punk teams with Rhodes, Reigns and others to take on The Vision and their loose allies. Survivor Series also features the penultimate stop in John Cena's retirement tour. The new intercontinental champion will grant Dominik Mysterio a rematch before turning his attention to the winner of The Last Time is Now tournament.Take a look below at the confirmed matches for Survivor Series and take a glance at the crystal ball of what may come. The event streams live on ESPN Unlimited starting at 6:30 p.m. ET.\n2025 WWE Survivor Series matchesCM Punk, Cody Rhodes, The Usos (Jey Uso & Jimmy Uso) and Roman Reigns vs. The Vision (Bron Breakker, Bronson Reed & Logan Paul), Drew McIntyre and Brock Lesnar (WarGames match): Survivor Series' main event must have taken a turn after Seth Rollins suffered an injury at Crown Jewel. The Vision now moves on without him, forming an alliance with Logan Paul in the process. On Nov. 14, McIntyre joined The Vision's team to circumvent a suspension handed to him by SmackDown general manager Nick Aldis. The final spots on each team were claimed by Lesnar, siding with Heyman's group, and Reigns reuniting with his cousins.Rhea Ripley, Iyo Sky, Alexa Bliss, Charlotte Flair and AJ Lee vs. Nia Jax, Lash Legend, The Kabuki Warriors (Asuka & Kari Sane) and Becky Lynch: Multiple rivalries come to a head in this year's women's WarGames match. Ripley and Sky have been feuding with the Kabuki Warriors. WWE women's tag team champions Bliss and Flair have sparked up a fresh rivalry with the new tandem of Jax and Lash. After the match was booked, Flair exited her team, claiming she couldn't trust Ripley. That leaves two spots to fill on Ripley's team, and one for Jax's. Flair and Ripley eventually patched things up, bolstering their ranks with Lee, while Jax and company enlisted Lynch.Intercontinental Championship -- John Cena (c) vs. Dominik Mysterio: Cena is a first-ballot Hall of Famer, and the first 17-time world champion recognized by WWE, but until recently, he was not a Grand Slam champion. That's because the intercontinental title has surprisingly eluded him for two decades. On Nov. 10, Cena defeated Mysterio in an impromptu match for the intercontinental title. They will have their rematch at Survivor Series.\nWomen's World Championship -- Stephanie Vaquer (c) vs. Nikki Bella: Bella is going nowhere. Three months after a failed bid for the women's intercontinental title, Bella struck Vaquer from behind. Her villainous turn sets the stage for Vaquer's next title defense at a cornerstone WWE pay-per-view.\n            ",

DeMarco will remain on the bench for the Warriors for the time being, and it has not yet been determined when he will make the switch to working solely with the Liberty.DeMarco, who has been with the Warriors since 2012, helped the franchise win four NBA titles and is regarded as a defensive specialist. He has also served as the head coach for the Bahamas men's national basketball team since 2019. Liberty star Sabrina Ionescu reached out to Warriors star Steph Curry during this process to get his thoughts on DeMarco, per ESPN.The Liberty won the first title in franchise history in 2024, and got off to a 9-0 start last season. Injuries eventually derailed their campaign, however, and they were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Mercury. Days after their Game 3 defeat, the Liberty announced that Brondello would not return as coach. During Brondello's four seasons in charge, the Liberty went 107-53, won a franchise-record 32 games in both 2023 and 2024, never missed the playoffs and made two Finals appearances. In addition to their 2024 WNBA championship, Brondello also captured the Commissioner's Cup title in 2023.\nDespite all of Brondello's success, general manager Jonathan Kolb and the Liberty's brain trust felt it was necessary to go in a different direction to get the most out of their championship window. \"Coming out of this season and really seeing an influx of change on many teams, it made the decision timeline tangible and one that we can be actionable on,\" Kolb said during his exit interview about the decision to move on from Brondello. \"You can stand still or you can embrace change and move forward. My commitment is to keep pushing the New York Liberty to new heights. We believe that embracing this change will bring a freshness and an energy to our group.\"\nThe Liberty only have two players under contract for 2026 -- Leonie Fiebich and Nyara Sabally -- and like every team in the league face a fascinating offseason. Breanna Stewart, Ionescu and Jonquel Jones have all expressed a desire to return, but it remains to be seen how free agency will work after a new collective bargaining agreement is ratified. In addition to trying to re-sign their Big Three, the Liberty will have big decisions to make about Natasha Cloud and Emma Meesseman. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        It has been more than three weeks since the WNBA and WNBA Players Association announced that they had agreed to a 30-day extension of their current collective bargaining agreement, which means we are just over a week away from the new deadline of Nov. 30. At the beginning of this month, I presented the case for optimism that a deal would be reached. There is so much money coming into the league, enough riches to go around to make all parties satisfied enough to come to an agreement that would help keep the league's massive wave of momentum going. Earlier this week, the WNBA's most recent offer to the players leaked, with headlines that made the proposal sound pretty enticing, with a possible maximum salary above $1.1 million, a minimum salary of more than $220,000 and an average salary of more than $460,000. In 2025, the league's minimum salary was around $66,000 and its supermax was about $250,000. These are eye-popping numbers, and a source told the Associated Press that this was \"a highly lucrative package providing substantial increases over prior years and designed to bring negotiations to a quick conclusion.\"\nSo, great news, right? Well, not so fast. These numbers are a bit misleading, because no player would sign a contract for a base salary of above $1 million, according to Front Office Sports. Rather, in 2026, the base supermax would still be around the $850,000, but revenue sharing would potentially lift max salaries above the $1 million range. The WNBPA \"does not view the WNBA's latest collective bargaining agreement proposal as something that moves negotiations forward,\" according to ESPN.Ultimately, it seems that the two sides are still operating under two different financial frameworks. Last October, when the WNBPA announced its decision to opt out of the current CBA, which went into place in 2020, WNBPA president Nneka Ogwumike said that players weren't simply seeking more money; rather, they were looking to change the foundation of compensation for women's sports. \n\"We are ready to lead transformational change -- change that goes beyond women's sports and sets a precedent for something greater,\" Ogwumike said. \"Opting out isn't just about bigger paychecks -- it's about claiming our rightful share of the business we've built, improving working conditions, and securing a future where the success we create benefits today's players and the generations to come. We're not just asking for a CBA that reflects our value; we're demanding it, because we've earned it.\"In the year since, WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert has often echoed that language. But there does not seem to be an agreement on what \"transformational\" means.Players are seeking a deal that directly ties the salaries to a percentage of basketball-related income. Many sports leagues, like the NBA, split revenue 50-50 with players, but it is estimated that WNBA players only receive less than 10% of league revenue. In the current CBA, players have fixed salaries that increase by 3% every year and revenue sharing is only triggered if predetermined, cumulative targets are met. The current CBA was written before the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the 2020 season and, because of the way the revenue-sharing targets were calculated, they were never triggered despite the massive increase in revenue the WNBA has experienced in the past few years. Players do not want to sign a deal that would see them left behind if the business continues to boom.\nThe current deal on the table from the WNBA does seem to include a revenue-sharing component, which is how players on a max salary would potentially earn more than $1.1 million despite signing a contract for $850,000. But ESPN reported that \"sources told ESPN the players' union does not believe the league's proposal includes a system where the salary cap and player salaries sufficiently grow with the business.\"In order to reach a new deal, one of two things would need to happen: The WNBA would need to adopt the revenue-sharing framework that the WNBPA is proposing or the WNBA would need to boost fixed salary numbers high enough that players are willing to forego the fight for the revenue-share model of their dreams. If neither of those things happen, a work stoppage is likely.If there is no deal reached by the new Nov. 30 deadline, the players and league could agree on another extension. If neither happens, that does not automatically mean that a lockout goes into effect -- the status quo could remain in tact, which would allow players to continue to have access to team facilities and staff while negotiations continue. But if there is no official extension in place, the players or league could trigger a lockout at any given time. Hopefully, a transformational compromise can be reached before that happens. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Lane Kiffin Watch continues. After meeting with Kiffin on Friday, Ole Miss athletic director Keith Carter said the focus is on next Friday's Egg Bowl vs. rival Mississippi State and that \"an announcement on Coach Kiffin's future is expected the Saturday following the game.\"That statement comes in the aftermath of what has been a wild week in Oxford, Mississippi. After a plane carrying multiple Kiffin family members, including ex-wife Layla Kiffin, traveled to Baton Rouge on Monday, the discussion of whether Kiffin will stay or go cranked into overdrive. There was also a less-publicized Kiffin family trip to Gainesville, Florida, the day before as the Gators continue to make their play for Kiffin's services, sources confirmed to CBS Sports. While it is unlikely there will be definitive clarity before next Saturday, numerous sources with knowledge of the situation have told CBS Sports in the last 24 hours that they believe the momentum has shifted in LSU's favor to land the talented head coach. To be clear, that does not mean it's a done deal. Throughout the week, Kiffin has seemingly gone back and forth by the day while trying to make a decision. For example, there were multiple days this week that sources felt like it was trending toward Kiffin taking the job at LSU only for it to then come across the next day like he was giving real thought to staying at Ole Miss. \"It's like following a high school recruiting process,\" one source said.Sources have indicated throughout the week that they believe Florida is running third in the Kiffin sweepstakes. \n\n        \n            \n                Ole Miss wants clarity from Lane Kiffin. He's not in a position to give it. What's next?\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAccording to those who know him well, Kiffin can struggle when making big decisions, which is why so many are hesitant to say definitively what he will do until he signs the contract. As many have pointed out in recent days, it felt like a foregone conclusion at one point that Kiffin was going to take the Auburn job back in 2022 before he ultimately decided to stay in Oxford. No. 6 Ole Miss (10-1) closes its regular season with the Egg Bowl against Mississippi State with a win potentially giving the Rebels a first-round home game in the College Football Playoff. CBS Sports reported earlier this week that sources said if Ole Miss was convinced Kiffin was not staying long-term in Oxford, it would not let him coach in the playoff. Ole Miss hoped to get clarity this week on Kiffin's decision, prompting Friday's meeting between Carter, Kiffin and Ole Miss chancellor Glenn Boyce. \"Coach Kiffin and I have had many pointed and positive conversations regarding his future at Ole Miss, including meeting today with Chancellor Boyce,\" Carter said. \"While we discuss next steps, we know we cannot lose sight of what is most important -- our sixth-ranked team that is poised to finish the regular season in historic fashion.\"\nCarter's statement made clear Kiffin will be coaching the Egg Bowl -- but now attention turns to whether that will be his last as Ole Miss' coach. \n            ",

Though that is around $300,000 less than he was making at Penn State, it does keep him among the top 20 highest-paid coaches in college football.Franklin's compensation is also staggered. He's set to make $500,000 in base annual salary with the rest of the money coming from incentives. Franklin will make more money each year of the deal, with the contract's value set to peak at $12.75 million in 2030. Notably, Virginia Tech is also increasing Franklin's salary pool to $15.5 million, which means that he'll have plenty of money to assemble his inaugural coaching staff with the Hokies. Here's a look at the other incentives baked into Franklin's first contract: \nHe can make up to $250,000 in bonuses for 12-win seasons. He'll be awarded $150,000 for any coach of the year awards. Franklin will receive bonuses for ACC Championship Game and College Football Playoff appearances with an $800,000 for winning a national title. Penn State and Franklin also agreed to a reduced buyout in light of his hiring at Virginia Tech. Instead of paying Franklin $49 million over the course of six years, Penn State is on the hook for just $9 million of Franklin's previous agreement with the school. Penn State fired Franklin in October amid a 3-3 start to the 2025 season. He departed the Nittany Lions with a 104-45 overall record, three top-10 finishes in the AP Top 25 poll, one Big Ten title (2016) and an appearance in the 2024 College Football Playoff. \nFranklin is set to replace Brent Pry, his former defensive coordinator at Penn State. Pry never won more than seven games with the Hokies, who were 0-3 at the time of his departure in September.  \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The last game of the year for the NWSL brings plenty of pomp and circumstance. There are celebrations and events to mark the NWSL Championship and the final two teams and players participating. There's also the news and headlines around offseason moves and what comes next. There has been plenty of reporting on the Washington Spirit and the contract status of Trinity Rodman ahead of the 2025 NWSL Championship. But for Gotham FC, they also have a key player navigating free agency leading into the big game. Forward Midge Purce has been with the club since 2020, back when they were Sky Blue FC. She's been with the team through sparse resources, a club rebrand, and an epic rise as bona fide contenders. When the club reached the NWSL Championship in 2023, her two-assist performance in the final earned her Championship MVP honors. Her impressive form earned her call-ups back into the national team, and then a huge setback, an ACL injury in March 2024, her previous contract year, and right as the U.S. women's national team was preparing for the Paris Olympics and Gotham FC began their title defense. Her journey back to the 2025 NWSL Championship is a story of triumphant highs and crushing setbacks. But there's also a resilient, quieter comeback that's set her up for another opportunity as an x-factor in Gotham's biggest game of the year. It's also one that could be her last in a Gotham FC jersey, as she's a free agent this offseason.\n\"I think you know you experience probably some of the worst case scenarios,\" Purce said on navigating the highs and lows of free agency. \"And I actually had the worst case scenario, which is, you tear your ACL going into that contract year. That wasn't amazing, but after that, coming back, you know, it's kind of no fear. So I just want to make sure I make the right decision for myself. Just putting me first.\"Where those decisions take her is yet to be determined. Sources familiar with Purce's previous negotiations confirmed to CBS Sports that other NWSL clubs were open to conversations about the forward with her skillset and versatility, but that other leagues were also interested, including Liga MX Femenil. \nPurce's road to recovery now culminates in another big stage moment. It's a testament to her determination and how the road back isn't a solo trip, and she makes sure to mention Rose Lavelle and Tierna Davidson as teammates she's relied on for advice and encouragement on injuries and injury setbacks in her own return to play. She's featured in 22 games this season, but didn't finally string together a full 90 minute game until the second half of the season.Her ability to create space, drive possession, and generate chances, are all major factors that don't always show up on the scoresheet. For now, she's just focused on the championship in front of her and not so much on whether or not this will be the last game she plays for Gotham FC. \"I don't really think about it that way, and maybe I should,\" she joked. \"You know, I've done this to myself before, where I don't sign a contract, and I'm playing a lot and I'm playing in big games. I just like to bet on myself, and if it doesn't work out, it doesn't work out. So I'm excited for the game. I'm pumped about it, and we'll see what follows after.\"\nPurce is a feeler on the pitch, and her instinct to find the game in moments where there's little tempo or lack of flow, is when she can be most effective. She's a difference maker in the final third, especially in high-stakes scenarios. If it is her final game in a Gotham kit, she wants it to be as memorable as possible. \"If it is my last game in a Gotham jersey, I just, I haven't even thought about that,\" she paused. \"I have to say the fandom is absolutely incredible. I love everyone who has been so committed and has created this amazing community and has watched. It's been an honor to watch it grow from Sky Blue to what it is now, and the caliber of players it's attracted and the statement it has made on not just a national scale, but a global scale. And I just want to say thank you to all my teammates who have made this time, just, you know, through the hard times and through the good times. No one else really sees everything the way my teammates do, so sending them so much love. Not just now, but for the rest of their careers and the rest of their lives. Just, thank you.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\nTwo star-studded teams in the Washington Spirit and Gotham FC will meet in San Jose for the NWSL Championship, a competitive match likely in store as each side chases their second league title.The pair took contrasting roads to the Championship, the No. 2 seed Spirit advancing as the favorites in their matchups while Gotham played spoiler as the No. 8 seed, eliminating the runaway NWSL Shield winners in the Kansas City Current and last year's champions Orlando Pride. To describe this as a David vs. Goliath-type game would be a misnomer, though, Gotham have been inconsistent, but they won the Championship just two years ago and boast an MVP nominee in Esther Gonzalez.While Gonzalez and new Gotham recruit Jaedyn Shaw headline Juan Carlos Amoros' team, the attention will also be squarely on the Spirit's Trinity Rodman. She returned from an MCL sprain in a very brief cameo in the Spirit's 2-0 win over the Portland Thorns last week, her exact status unclear. If there is any game she could play, though, it just might be one where there's a trophy on the line – in what could be her final NWSL game, her contract expiring upon the conclusion of the season.How to watch the NWSL Championship, oddsDate: Saturday, Nov. 2 | Time: 7=8 p.m. ETLocation: PayPal Park -- San Jose, Calif.Odds: Washington Spirit +130; Draw +210; Gotham FC +190Projected lineupsWashington Spirit: Aubrey Kingsbury, Rosemonde Kouassi, Esme Morgan, Rebeca Bernal, Tara McKeown, Kate Weisner, Hal Hershfelt, Leicy Santos, Croix Bethune, Trinity Rodman, Gift MondayRodman's availability will be the big talking point on Saturday, in large part because the Spirit are a different team when she is on the field. They have won nine of the 16 games she has played this season and posted a +15 goal differential along the way, while the number of wins dwindles to four in 11 games she did not play with a goal differential of -3. If Rodman cannot start, though, Italy international Sofia Cantore could fill in after starting against the Thorns while the Spirit's attacking plans will run through Gift Monday regardless, the Nigerian scoring 10 goals so far this season.Gotham FC: Ann-Katrin Berger, Bruninha, Emily Sonnett, Jess Carter, Lily Reale, Jaelin Howell, Jaedyn Shaw, Rose Lavelle, Gabi Portillo, Midge Purce, Esther GonzalezGotham's defensive stability has kept them afloat in a year of inconsistent attacking output, though not from a lack of effort on Gonzalez's part. The Spain international has 13 goals this season, just two behind MVp winner Temwa Chawinga, and Shaw's scintillating form has helped Gotham make up some of the attacking deficit left behind after Yazmeen Ryan and Lynn Biyendolo's departures in the offseason. Rose Lavelle is also in strong form, connecting expertly with international teammate Shaw to revive Gotham's offense at just the right time.PredictionThere is motivation and narrative to support either team's argument, setting up for a closely-contested Championship game – and perhaps a spicy one, if last year's semifinal in which the Spirit ousted Gotham on penalty kicks is anything to go by. This one will likely come down to a moment of brilliance from a star and there is no one who is more in-form than Shaw. She has two goals and an assist during Gotham's postseason run, a contribution on each and every goal they have scored in the playoffs so far. She has helped them pull off two upsets in a row, a third not exactly out of reach for a roster just as stacked as the one they will face. Pick: Washington Spirit 1, Gotham FC 2 (after extra time)\n            ",

Aiyuk was expected to return to the field at some point this season after recovering from a devastating knee injury suffered last year, but as the season starts to wind down, things have only gotten more murky.According to ESPN and The Athletic, San Francisco voided Aiyuk's guaranteed money for the 2026 season during training camp for not meeting the requirements of his contract extensions signed in August 2024, worth $120 million over four years. Aiyuk's contract included an option bonus worth $24.935 million, which originally became guaranteed on April 1, but is now void. It's unclear if the 49ers will pay his $1.215 million base salary and bonuses for workouts and per-game appearances. Aiyuk has been missing from the gridiron since suffering a right knee injury in October 2024. He tore his ACL, MCL and meniscus against the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 7 last season. The team had initially hoped to get him back to practice around midseason. however, the clock is winding down with six regular-season games left.\n\"Brandon's just  week-to-week,\" Niners coach Kyle Shanahan told reporters on Monday. \"When he had such a big  injury like that,  just waiting until he is fully comfortable to come up  and start  practicing.\" \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        A big fight card goes down on Saturday, with four world title bouts anchoring the action from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. In the headliner, WBC light heavyweight champion David Benavidez will put his title on the line against Anthony Yarde.The other three championship bouts set for the event are WBO welterweight champion Brian Norman Jr. against Devin Haney, WBC and WBO junior bantamweight champion Jesse \"Bam\" Rodriguez battling WBA champ Fernando Martinez in a three-belt unification bout, and Abdullah Mason facing Sam Noakes for the vacant WBO lightweight championship.There are plenty of intriguing storylines running through the card, so let's take a look at the odds and break down all four world title fights.David Benavidez vs. Anthony Yarde fight card, oddsOdds via FanDuel SportsbookDavid Benavidez (c) -1200 vs. Anthony Yarde +680, WBC light heavyweight titleBrian Norman Jr. (c) -112 vs. Devin Haney -112, WBO welterweight titleJesse \"Bam\" Rodriguez (c) -1200 vs. Fernando Martinez (c) +670, unified junior bantamweight titleAbdullah Mason -430 vs. Sam Noakes +300, vacant WBO lightweight titleAbdullah Mason vs. Sam NoakesThe 21-year-old Mason (19-0, 17 KO) has been a hot prospect since turning professional in 2021. He has been on the standard prospect track of facing lower-level talent before slowly moving up to more difficult challenges. In his most recent fight, Mason faced the most dangerous test of his career, taking on Jeremia Nakathila. Nakathila was unable to continue after the fourth round as Mason cruised again.\nIn Noakes (17-0, 15 KO), Mason is facing another up-and-comer, though one seven years his senior. Noakes' career has been very similar to Mason's, with a comparable stoppage rate and journey from facing lower-level talent to a few wins over veterans such as Yvan Mendy and Ryan Walsh.Mason is someone who feels as though he has the makings of a special fighter, while Noakes feels like he tops out at being a very good one. That said, neither fighter has faced much resistance in their careers; in their four combined fights that went to decision, they lost a total of two rounds. This has the potential to be a very good fight that teaches plenty about both fighters. Pick: Abdullah Mason via UD (+220)Jesse \"Bam\" Rodriguez vs. Fernando MartinezRodriguez (22-0, 15 KO) had a breakthrough 2022, when he accepted a fight with Carlos Cuadras for the WBC super flyweight championship on one week's notice. Jumping up a weight class on short notice, Rodriguez won the title and defended it twice against Srisaket Sor Rungvisai and Israel Gonzalez before returning to flyweight. At flyweight, Rodriguez won two titles before returning to super flyweight, where he has continued piling up impressive victories while becoming a unified champion once again -- and grabbing the No. 5 spot in the CBS Sports pound-for-pound rankings.\nMartinez (18-0, 9 KO) is a fighter who thrives on aggression. He won the IBF title by beating Jerwin Ancajas in 2022. After winning the belt, Martinez successfully defended in a rematch before beating Jade Bornea and Kazuto Ioka (twice). The fight has been targeted for a while, and now the two best fighters at 115 pounds are set to mix it up.Rodriguez is a brilliant tactical fighter who unleashes combinations as well as anyone in the game. Martinez will have to figure out a way for his aggression to nullify Rodriguez's footwork and force the issue in exchanges. That's a big ask, though. Regardless, this has all the makings of one of the best fights of the year. Pick: Jesse \"Bam\" Rodriguez via UD (+290)Brian Norman Jr. vs. Devin HaneyHaney (32-0, 15 KO) comes into the fight as the bigger name. As the former undisputed lightweight champion, Haney has been in some huge fights in his career. As important as undisputed title fights against George Kambosos Jr. and Vasiliy Lomachenko were, the fight most people remember for Haney is the thumping he received from Ryan Garcia in April 2024. Haney was dropped by Garcia three times in a fight that came as Garcia appeared to be spiraling in a mental health crisis. Garcia, who also missed weight, failed drug tests, leading to a no-contest. By that technicality, Haney is still undefeated, but he looked very gunshy against Jose Ramirez in a terrible fight in May.\nNorman (28-0, 22 KO) packs plenty of power, and if Haney is still as worried about getting hit as he appeared to be against Ramirez, this could be a long night for him. Norman is on a career best run over his past three fights, winning the interim WBO welterweight belt by knocking out Giovani Santillan and being promoted to full champion when Terence Crawford vacated the belt to move up in weight. As champ, Norman has knocked out Derrieck Cuevas and Jin Sasaki.Haney opened the fight as a near -145 favorite but now sits at a slight -112 underdog to Norman's -120. It's hard to erase the image of Haney repeatedly crumbling when hit by Garcia's left hooks and the almost complete inability to get out of neutral against Ramirez in one of the worst fights you'll ever see. For those reasons, it's not difficult to see Norman scoring the biggest win of his career on Saturday. Pick: Brian Norman Jr. via TKO9 (+210)David Benavidez vs. Anthony YardeBoth main event fighters have promised a shootout. Benavidez told DAZN that he's happy to meet in a fan-friendly fight.\n\"I watched his fights,\" Benavidez said. \"He likes to go forward, he likes to press the action, he likes to look for the knockout, so I'm the same way. So I think at the end of the day it's going to be both egos going at each other -- who's going to back up? It's not going to be me. It's probably not going to be him, either.  \"When we're ready to go to war the people are going to see a great war, and that's what we're here for, to give the fans what they want to see.\"Benavidez (30-0, 24 KO) is now fully established at light heavyweight, a division he moved to when it was clear Saul \"Canelo\" Alvarez was never going to meet him in the ring. Benavidez took an at times ugly win over Oleksandr Gvozdyk to win the WBC interim title and then defended that belt with a big win over fellow former super middleweight David Morrell. Now, having been promoted to full champion, Benavidez looks to make his first defense against Yarde.Yarde (27-3, 24 KO) has twice challenged for light heavyweight world titles, losing to Sergey Kovalev in 2019 and Artur Beterbiev in 2023. In his losses to Kovalev and Lyndon Arthur, Yarde picked up a reputation as someone who was missing the ability to dig deep and a willingness to walk through fire when things got difficult. While Yarde was stopped by Beterbiev in the eighth round of their fight, he shook some of those labels by returning fire and digging deep to give Beterbiev a very difficult fight.\nBenavidez is the better fighter heading into this one, but his power has yet to fully translate to 175 pounds. The Yarde who showed up against Beterbiev could pull off a massive upset. That result does feel unlikely, though. Pick: David Benavidez via UD (+185)\n            ",

    "body": "\n        SAN JOSE -- The quest for the 2025 NWSL Championship enters its final day, the Washington Spirit face a pivotal question: Will soon-to-be free agent Trinity Rodman be fit to play?Spirit head coach Adrian Gonzalez offered the update fans have been waiting for: Rodman is \"going to be available and ready to compete.\"\"Trin is doing good. She's been, I think, improving so quick, pushing to be able to play,\" Gonzalez said. \"Fortunately, we could see her last week, playing some minutes, and she's doing great, so obviously she's going to be available and ready to compete.\"Rodman's season has been marred by injuries. A lingering back injury sidelined her for nearly four months and even sent her to Europe for treatment. Just 16 games after she returned, an MCL sprain kept her sidelined during the playoff push. She was bench-listed for both playoff games, making only a brief cameo in the final minute of Washington's semifinal win over Portland -- her first action in a month. Now, with the Spirit on the brink of a second NWSL Championship title in four years, her game-day availability could be the difference between glory and heartbreak.\nYou can catch the game Saturday at 8 p.m. ET on CBS and Paramount+.Rodman has dominated championship-week headlines -- not just because of her return from injury, but for what comes next. The 23-year-old enters the final game of the season as a potential free agent this offseason, with a report looming regarding a lucrative offer from USL Super League side D.C. Power, according to The Athletic. Her future has become a talking point across the league, has prompted commissioner Jessica Berman to emphasize that she and the league \"want Trinity in the NWSL and we will fight for her.\" That backdrop adds even more intrigue to her availability for Saturday's must-watch title clash.Rodman's return to the pitch this season has been anything but smooth, but the fact that Gonzalez declared her \"available and ready to compete\" is a significant upgrade, considering she was labeled as questionable entering the semifinal against Portland, where she subbed in as a late-game option and played a minute. \nWhile that's not a ringing endorsement of the ability to play lengthy minutes, it took Rodman one minute and four touches to record a definitive shot on goal. It shows again why she's such an important player, no matter the amount of time she can give to the Spirit in a high-stakes game like the NWSL Championship. Her availability isn't just a boost; it could be a potential game-changer.\n            ",

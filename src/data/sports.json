    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL playoffs are set with Denver and Seattle the top seeds in their respective conferences. Thus, they won't partake in the 2026 Wild Card Weekend NFL schedule but several other Super Bowl contenders are available to make Wild Card NFL bets on. Teams like the Texans and Jaguars enter in on win streaks of nine and eight games, respectively, and could be highly sought after with NFL picks. Meanwhile, Green Bay is riding a four-game losing streak and is a 1.5-point underdog to the Bears on Saturday night, per the latest Wild Card Weekend NFL odds.Those two split their regular season matchups as they'll tangle in the postseason for just the third time ever. The NFL line for that game matches Bills vs. Jaguars (+1.5) as the slimmest of the Wild Card Weekend NFL spreads, while the largest has the Rams favored by 10.5 points over the Panthers. Other spreads include 49ers vs. Eagles (-4.5), Chargers vs. Patriots (-3.5) and Steelers vs. Texans (-3). All of the updated Wild Card Weekend NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Wild Card Weekend NFL picks now.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters the 2026 NFL playoffs on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now, it has turned its attention to the latest Wild Card Weekend NFL odds and NFL betting lines and locked in betting picks for every NFL matchup. Head here to see every pick. Top Wild Card Weekend NFL predictionsOne of the model's strongest Wild Card Weekend NFL picks is the Steelers (+3, 39.5) covering at Houston on Monday night at 8 p.m. ET. These teams have the same 9-8 spread record, but Pittsburgh is 4-1 ATS over its last five, while Houston has failed to cover in two of its last three. While Houston has an elite defense, it allowed its most points (30) all year in Week 18 to a Colts team with a fourth-string rookie quarterback, which is no comparison to an Aaron Rodgers-led unit getting back a rested DK Metcalf. As for C.J. Stroud, he is 0-2 on the road in his playoffs career, failing to account for a touchdown in either loss.

L.A. is also facing a team with an 8-9 record, and teams with losing records are 2-6 in the playoffs all-time. The Rams have the league's best offense, ranking first in points, total yards and yards per play, and it's a unit that doesn't hurt itself as no one has committed fewer penalties. Matthew Stafford has two touchdowns and no interceptions in each of his last three postseason starts, and the MVP contender is riding a seven-game playoff streak with multiple touchdown passes. This season, Stafford has more TD passes (46) than Carolina has total touchdowns (35) as the Panthers rank 27th in both points scored and total yards. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Panthers can coverIt was just six weeks ago that Carolina upset the Rams as double-digit underdogs, forcing Stafford into three turnovers. The Panthers have 10 ATS wins as an underdog this year, the most in the NFL, and they also have a one-day rest advantage after playing last Saturday. The Rams have lost three of their last four road games, and the Panthers are decidedly more potent on offense at Bank of America Stadium. Five of their six highest point totals this year have come at home, and the most points they scored all year came versus Los Angeles in Week 13. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Rams vs. Panthers picksSportsLine's model has simulated Panthers vs. Rams 10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 48 combined points.

    "body": "\n        The 2026 Peach Bowl will see Big Ten teams squaring off on Friday as the No. 1 Indiana Hoosiers face the No. 5 Oregon Ducks. This 2026 College Football Playoff semifinal contest is a rematch of a mid-October game in which the Hoosiers prevailed on the road, 30-20. That remains the only loss for the 13-1 Ducks, who are coming off a dominant 23-0 shutout win over Texas Tech. As for the 14-0 Hoosiers, they are coming off a 38-3 blowout of Alabama and have aspirations of becoming the first 16-0 team in college football history.Kickoff is at 7:30 p.m. ET from Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. The Hoosiers are 3.5-point favorites in the latest Oregon vs. Indiana odds per SportsLine consensus. The over/under for total points is 47.5.

The Ducks have also covered at at 75% clip as an underdog since 2023, while IU is just 5-4 ATS over its last nine versus Big Ten teams. On the field, Oregon possesses the better offense both on the ground and through the air. The Ducks average more passing yards than Indiana, with a higher completion percentage, in addition to averaging more rushing yards, as well as more yards per carry. On the other side of the ball, Oregon is coming off a season-high of four takeaways in the win over Texas Tech, and the Ducks had a pick-six of Fernando Mendoza in the first contest. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why Indiana can coverNo one can match Indiana's production on both sides of the ball, as it has the No. 2 scoring defense and No. 3 scoring offense, and no other FBS team ranks in the top five of both. The Hoosiers have allowed two touchdowns, total, over their last four games, and they've given up a rushing touchdown in just one of their last nine games. Mendoza leads the nation with both 36 passing touchdowns and with a 184.7 passer rating, and Indiana isn't the type of team that hurts itself. Just one team in all of college football commits fewer penalty yards per game, while just two teams in the country commit fewer turnovers per game.

Ole Miss has also scored 30-plus in eight straight overall, which is the longest active streak in FBS, as the team is actually averaging more points since Lane Kiffin's departure. Quarterback Trinidad Chambliss won a DII national title last year at Ferris State, and he's thrived in the postseason. Chambliss is 6-0 in his NCAA playoffs career, with a staggering 23 total touchdowns compared to just one turnover. He leads an offense which Miami could have problems keeping up with as the Hurricanes' two lowest offensive outputs of the season have come in their last two games. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why Miami can cover The Canes have won their last four games versus SEC teams, and they are 5-0 ATS this season versus ranked opponents. Miami's defense is as good as anyone's, ranking fourth in the nation in points allowed per game (13.1). It has allowed seven total touchdowns over its last six games, which were all wins, and the team also has three times as many takeaways (12) as giveaways (four) during this stretch. Additionally, Miami can keep Ole Miss' explosive offense on the sideline by attacking the Rebels' defense on the ground and eating up the clock. Just two SEC teams allow more yards per rush (4.2) than Ole Miss, which has allowed an average of 167 rushing yards over its last three games. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Miami vs. Ole Miss picksFornelli has analyzied Ole Miss vs. Miami and is leaning Under on the total.

On Sunday, the latest NFL lines have the Bills at -1.5 vs. the Jaguars, the Eagles at -4.5 vs. the 49ers, and the Patriots at -3.5 vs. the Chargers. A playoff edition of 'Monday Night Football' concludes the slate with the Texans favored by 3 points on the road against the Steelers. The over/under for Texans vs. Steelers is 39.5 points, the lowest on the NFL odds board. SportsLine's Eric Cohen has revealed his exact score prediction for each game to help you formulate spread, over/under, money-line and even NFL best bets as Wild Card Weekend approaches.A SportsLine expert and CBS on-air talent, Cohen has evaluated the entire NFL playoff slate and delivers score predictions and logic for each matchup. Cohen went 180-91-1 (66%) on his NFL straight-up picks this season, and was a sizzling 10-3 (77%) on his straight-up NFL playoff picks last season. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now he's turned his attention to the 2026 NFL Wild Card Weekend, studied each matchup in depth, and has revealed his exact NFL score predictions for each game. All NFL betting lines via DraftKings Sportsbook.Los Angeles Rams (-10.5) at Carolina Panthers\n\"Carolina won this matchup on November 30, 31-28, in one of the more impactful upsets for both teams in the NFL this season,\" Cohen said. \"That's not happening again. While Sean McVay's team hasn't looked great lately, they'll exact serious revenge as a double-digit road favorite on Saturday. The Panthers have absolutely no business being in the playoffs and it's going to be a wake up call to the other teams in the conference. I would be mildly surprised if this wasn't a blowout.\"Pick: Rams 34, Panthers 12Green Bay Packers at Chicago Bears (+1)\n\"This will be the NFC North rivals' third matchup since December 7,\" Cohen said. \"Green Bay held on by a touchdown in the first one, before blowing a 10 point lead in the final two minutes and falling in overtime. I believe that Packers coach Matt LaFleur's job is on the line. While his team makes the playoffs just about every season, they have lost four of their last five in the postseason and finished the 2025 regular season on a four game losing streak. I'm just not sure the Bears are ready for this kind of pressure, especially against a rested Green Bay team. In another thriller on Saturday night, the Packers exact a matter of revenge for the Week 16 collapse.\"Pick: Packers 23, Bears 21Buffalo Bills (-1.5) at Jacksonville Jaguars\n\"Winners of nine of their last 10 games, I have a hard time picking against Jacksonville at home,\" Cohen said. \"Buffalo's passing game is devoid of weapons and the Jaguars boast the NFL's top rush defense to slow Josh Allen and James Cook. While Allen and the Bills are 5-0 in the Wild Card Round since 2020, all five of those games have been at home. Trevor Lawrence has played at an MVP level since November and it will continue this weekend. The Jaguars win on a walk-off Cam Little field goal from 50-plus yards. If this result plays out as I anticipate, Sean McDermott won't be back to coach Buffalo next season.\"Pick: Jaguars 27, Bills 24San Francisco 49ers at Philadelphia Eagles (-4.5)\n\"With Philadelphia only giving 3.5 points on the early line, this is my favorite spread play of the Wild Card games,\" Cohen said. \"This is a matchup between the two NFC teams who have played in the last three Super Bowls, but I don't trust San Francisco's defense to hold up against the Eagles' potent receivers and Saquon Barkley on the ground. San Francisco had potentially three straight home games in front of them with a win against Seattle in Week 18. Now, after an offensive dud against the Seahawks, their season ends in disappointment in the City of Brotherly Love.\"Pick: Eagles 27, 49ers 21Los Angeles Chargers at New England Patriots (-3.5)\n\"My top play in this game is the Under 45.5 (though I may buy it up a few points in my weekend parlays),\" Cohen said. \"Both of these teams give up less than 21 points per game so don't expect fireworks. Of the Patriots' 14 wins, only three came against playoff teams (Panthers, Bills, Ravens) so they might have benefitted from a ridiculously weak schedule. Then again, the Chargers only beat two playoff teams (Broncos, Eagles), so I can't use that to their advantage. In their second playoffs under Jim Harbaugh (in two years), I think L.A. leads most of the game, with Drake Maye leading a late New England rally. \"Pick: Patriots 23, Chargers 21 Houston Texans (-3) at Pittsburgh Steelers \n\"I can't believe Aaron Rodgers found a way in the playoffs yet again,\" Cohen said. \"I have to think this is it for him either way. The Texans' defense should overwhelm the future Hall of Famer and hold Pittsburgh fairly in check. Entering the playoffs on a nine game winning streak and facing a team who I believe is a class below them, I think Houston's offense does enough to win. One betting note: Houston kicker Ka'imi Fairbairn had multiple field goal attempts in all 15 games he played in this season and hit his Over 1.5 made FGs in 14/15. Whatever the juice is, lay it in this game.\"Pick: Texans 23, Steelers 10How to get more NFL Wild Card Weekend picksSportsLine's model has simulated every Wild Card Weekend Game 10,000 times and revealed its picks.

On Wednesday's episode of the brothers' New Heights podcast, Travis didn't sound like someone who wanted to hang up his cleats just yet.\"I've talked to a few people in the facility already, having the exit meetings and everything, and they know where I stand at least right now,\" Kelce said. \"I think there's a lotta love for the game that's still there and I don't think I'll ever lose that. It's a tough thing to navigate, but at the same time, if my body can heal up and rest up and I can feel confident that I can go out there and give it another 18, 20, 21-week run, I think I would do it in a heartbeat. Right now it's just finding that answer and seeing how the body feels after this game and kinda when it all settles down.\" Jason Kelce prodded him from there, noting Chiefs star defensive tackle Chris Jones proclaimed Travis would return. Travis explained that's why they love Jones, because he's \"optimistic,\" but that a decision wasn't finalized yet. \nWhile deciding whether to put his body through another season of NFL football will be at top of mind for Kelce, one can't help but wonder if the way this Chiefs season ended will play a role as well. A loss to finish the season 6-11 certainly isn't how Kelce would draw up his final game with the Chiefs, and it's possible wanting to finish his career on a positive note will be part of the calculus when it comes to his decision. Patrick Mahomes will hopefully be back for the start of the 2026 season after suffering a torn ACL, and he'd certainly love to have his longtime top target back in the huddle for one more run to put 2025's disaster in the rearview and put a more appropriate bow on Kelce's Hall of Fame career. \nSpeculation ran strong that Kelce could walk away after last season if the Chiefs completed the three-peat. The Chiefs will give him time and space to make that decision, but would surely like an answer at least prior to the Draft so they can know whether the tight end position needs to be a bigger priority in their offseason plans.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        KeShawn Murphy's 3-point prayer to lift Auburn to a 91-90 buzzer-beating win Tuesday night over Texas A&M found nothing but the net. The Jungle erupted in pandemonium. Within seconds, his Tigers teammates enveloped him on the court in the most sacred of sports celebrations: that of the he just called game variety. Or so they thought. After a lengthy official review, the heroic heave was waved off. Texas A&M escaped with a 90-88 road win -- or, from another more popular perspective inside the building, Auburn was stripped of an epic buzzer-beater -- after the shot was deemed to have launched just after the final horn. Pandemonium ensued again in The Jungle after the shot that sunk the Aggies was stripped away. Officials had to be escorted by police back to the locker room area for their safety while fans in the arena heaved trash and drinks -- on the floor, at officials -- in general disgust and dejection. An elderly man can be seen amid the chaos tossing a cup of water over his shoulder at an official like he'd just finished studying Blake Griffin's teachings. Look closely at the middle of your screen at the two-second mark below. \nWhich begs, of course, the obvious question: What the heck just happened? And more to the point: Did Auburn just lose a game it actually won? My findings are below.\n🔎 Investigating the shotWith 0.6 seconds remaining on the game clock, Auburn forward Elyjah Freeman leaned right from the baseline and tossed a perfectly-placed missile to Murphy -- who walked right into the game-winner-that-wasn't. The shot was initially counted in real-time but only later waved off after video review.Take a look below and it's almost impossible to distinguish from the original television angle if the buzzer sounded before Murphy launched. \nThe call is so close that even a different angle with a better view of both Murphy and the game clock doesn't obviously lead to a conclusion. Watch the video below. Because it was a bang-bang play, I believe the initial call to count the basket was the right one. \nA story in four partsI slowed down the video above to 2% on iMovie and ran a loop of the final 0.2 seconds over, and over, and over. I presume the officials in the building had that angle -- or an angle very similar to that one, though we do not know -- when making their final call. Because they ultimately got the call right even if painstaking measures clearly had to be taken (and likely under duress, to boot).Here's the story of the shot in four parts broken down frame-by-frame. Part 1: 📸First, you can clearly see 0.1 seconds remaining on both the shot clock (above the backboard) and the scoreboard (far left of your screen.) The shot clock above the backboard is the official clock, and as you will see shortly, that's critical to the final call. Clear and obvious here is the ball still in Murphy's hand.Parts 2 & 3 📸Parts two and three of this story are where things go sideways. I'm sharing two photos of virtually the same moment in time because they are so close together. The official clock (again, above the backboard on the right side of the photo below) is not in sync with the scoreboard inside the building, likely off by perhaps as small as a centisecond. You can see the official clock strikes 0.0, while the scoreboard still has 0.1 seconds remaining. In the first photo below it appears Murphy has not fully released the ball.\nThis moment -- and again, likely within hundredths of a second of the one above -- is certainly less clear but still evident upon close inspection. You can see again the official clock above the backboard is 0.0 and the scoreboard to the left side of the photo has 0.1 seconds remaining. You can also see Murphy is still in contact with the ball.Part 4 📸The fourth and final shot is the most inconsequential. Below you can see the ball is clearly off, but the clock on both the scoreboard and the shot clock above the backboard are zeroed out. 📽️And here's one more look at that tremendous baseline angle from Johnny Congdon of ABC 33/40 News in Birmingham slowed down.\nThe verdictThe initial call that the basket counted was the correct call. Waving off the basket after further review was also correct, though reversing the initial decision to count it -- given how close it was -- is surprising. Auburn coach Steven Pearl, perhaps unsurprisingly, was equally as surprised about the decision to take the shot off the board. He could be seen after the game holding an iPad and pleading his case with one official. \"I don't have a clear understanding of what their reasoning behind what they were going off of, so we're going to gather more information and hopefully we can kind of elaborate on it,\" he said. \"But just from the angles that I saw, it looked like the ball was out of his hands on the red light on the scoreboard that we were looking at. But I would imagine they had a different angle that they were looking at and they determined that, you know, the ball wasn't out of his hands.\"\nPearl added in his presser that there was no communication after the call was made and that he was still seeking further clarification. He returned to the court after his press conference and seemingly was still seeking those answers.\"They just said it was no good and ran off the floor,\" Pearl added. \"I probably wouldn't want to talk to me in that moment anyway, so I get why they'd run away from me. But just from the angles that I saw, it looked like it was off his fingers. But I don't have all the same angles they have. I'm just looking at an iPad, and on the clock it says 0.2. But obviously, like -- on the floor I'm like, 'We just won the game, wow' -- so to go from that to sure enough .... they made a decision that it was on his fingertips. It's devastating.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- As Isaac McKneeley's contested 3-pointer ricocheted off the rim right to Duke's Dame Sarr with just under 14 minutes left in the Blue Devils' 84-73 win vs. Louisville on Tuesday, Cardinals coach Pat Kelsey turned and slammed both hands on the courtside table behind him. Kelsey could see a potential marquee victory slipping away from the Cardinals and had some frustration to let out. Duke had outscored Louisville 14-6 in the second half and was methodically taking control in a critical ACC battle the Cardinals once led by 12.Just 15 seconds later, the defensively resurgent Blue Devils took their first lead en route to a victory that established No. 6 Duke firmly atop the conference pecking order.The No. 20 Cardinals, who started 7 of 10 from 3-point range to ignite a crowd of 17,656, went cold in the second half. By the two-minute mark, Louisville fans streamed toward the exits, resigned to Duke extending its winning streak in the series to eight.\nStar freshman Cameron Boozer turned in another dominant performance with 27 points and eight rebounds to lead the Blue Devils, and coach Jon Scheyer was quick to note that \"what he's doing is unbelievable.\" But as great as Boozer was, and as great as the 43 points from the supporting duo of Isaiah Evans and Caleb Foster were, Tuesday's result stood out for something else entirely.\nDuke's defense, which was mired in its worst stretch since Scheyer's playing days, rediscovered its identity.\n\n        \n            \n                Trotter's Trends: Building a game plan to try and stop Michigan, explaining Duke's slipping defense\n                \n                    Isaac Trotter                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"They were as explosive as any offense we've played this season,\" Scheyer said. \"No question about it. The game really came down to, I think our defense in the second half was terrific.\" Duke's return to the basicsDuring their 11-0 start, Duke ranked No. 6 in defensive efficiency. But something changed in the second half of an 82-81 loss against Texas Tech on Dec. 20, as the Red Raiders shot a blistering 62.1% while erasing a 17-point deficit.The shoddy defense continued in uncomfortably close wins over projected ACC bottom feeders Georgia Tech and Florida State over the past week. Those three games marked the first time since February 2009 that Duke allowed three consecutive opponents to shoot 53% or better.\n\"We've gone through it,\" Scheyer said, adding that the Blue Devils spent Monday working on \"basic defensive drills\" for the sake of rebuilding good habits.\"Guarding the ball, moving as the ball moves and being in a stance,\" Scheyer explained, rattling off principles that might also be taught at Scheyer's summer youth camps.Even after that return to the basics, it was more of the same in the first half at Louisville, as sharpshooter Ryan Conwell drilled his first three 3-pointers. Then, reserve center Aly Khalifa got in on the fun by hitting his first three 3-pointers as the Cardinals opened up a 26-14 lead.\nThat's when Boozer put his foot down. Duke's freshman phenom responded with a quick 3-pointer of his own and scored 10 points over an 8-minute span to help keep the Blue Devils in touch.\n\"In that first half, he just settled us,\" Scheyer said. \"If he didn't do that, it could have gotten out of hand.\"The freshly settled Blue Devils regrouped at halftime and showed why they must be regarded as a Tier 1 threat to win the national championship.\nUnsung heroesCollectively, the trio of Boozer, Evans and Foster keyed Duke to a sterling 70.8% shooting performance in the second half. But offensive brilliance is nothing new for the Blue Devils, nor was Louisville's defensive susceptibility any grand revelation.That's why, in the same breaths that he used to praise his star trio for their production, Scheyer also credited Dame Sarr and Maliq Brown. The duo combined for just six points off the bench, but they played pivotal roles in slowing Louisville's offensive barrage to a crawl.A Cardinals team that hit 10 of 21 from 3-point range in the first half hit just 2 of 17 after halftime, and it wasn't because they suddenly forgot how to shoot. Clean looks that abounded in the first half dissipated for Louisville as Duke extended its defense, became more active and dared the perimeter-oriented Cardinals to try and score inside the arc. Sarr and Brown helped spearhead the charge.\n\"They're two of the best defenders I've ever been around,\" Boozer said. \"What they do for our team, it might not show up in the box score. But you definitely feel it throughout the game.\"The strong defensive effort came with a caveat, as Louisville star freshman and offensive maestro Mikel Brown Jr. missed his fifth straight game due to a back injury. But given how strong Louisville looked in the first half without Brown, there was plenty to glean from Duke's second half defensive effort.Conwell, who got to his spots at will in the first half, finished 0 for 4 from deep in the second half.\n\"With a guy like him, you want to make him work for it,\" Scheyer said. \"I think the first two threes he hit were clean looks. So that wasn't good. That was on me, not our guys. That was on me. But I thought just the fight, the discipline to make him score over the top…I think it was more about the fight and the effort by Dame, by Caleb and by Isaiah in the second half to really guard.\"More tests await in an ACC that has more teeth in 2026 than it did last season, when Duke cruised to a 19-1 mark in league play. Though the Blue Devils passed what may go down as their toughest road assignment of conference play by taking down the Cardinals, they can't rest on their laurels. The next challenge is Saturday against SMU, which is the league's highest-rated offensive team not named Duke or Louisville. The Mustangs hung 97 on North Carolina last weekend.But Duke took a big step back in the right direction against Louisville. Boozer played an unbelievable game. That's to be expected at this point.\nWhat was less certain, especially after the first half, is whether the defense would return for the first time in weeks. It did, and the Blue Devils demonstrated their championship-level potential in the process.\"We did some things in the second half that I thought was Duke defense,\" Scheyer said. \"How can we build from that and be true to who we are and what's made us really good so far?\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Washington star quarterback Demond Williams Jr. announced that he was entering the transfer portal on Tuesday night. Williams will have a do-not-contact tag when he officially enters. In a post shared to social media, Williams thanked Washington coaches, teammates and fans before announcing his departure.\"I have to do what is best for me and my future,\" Williams wrote. \"After much thought and prayer, I will be entering the transfer portal.\"News of Williams' intention to enter the portal comes just days after the star QB signed a new deal to return to Washington for the 2026 season. The Huskies are prepping to pursue any and all legal avenues to enforce the terms of that contract, according to ESPN. Sources tell CBS Sports' Matt Zentiz and Chris Hummer that LSU will be one of the teams to watch as Williams explores other options in the portal. The Tigers do have a need at quarterback, especially after Ole Miss quarterback Trinidad Chambliss chose to remain with the Rebels instead of following Lane Kiffin to Baton Rouge should he be granted a waiver for an extra year of eligibility that's still pending.\nOne of the best available playmakers hits open marketAs a sophomore in 2025, Williams ranked sixth in the Big Ten with 3,065 passing yards, and his 25 touchdown passes ranked fourth. He also showed off his mobility with 611 yards and six touchdowns on the ground. Williams did all that while leading Washington to a 9-4 record, which included a win over Boise State in the LA Bowl.Coming out of high school in Arizona, Williams was a four-star recruit and the No. 19 quarterback in the 2024 signing class, according to 247Sports. Although Williams didn't start for most of his true freshman season, he did play in every game before starting starting in the final two. His skill was evident, and he built upon that with a big 2025 season.In 26 games with the Huskies, Williams completed 71.5% of his throws for 4,009 yards, 33 touchdowns and nine interceptions while adding 893 yards and eight touchdowns on the ground.\nBehind Williams, the Huskies don't have a ton of experience at quarterback. The only other quarterback to attempt a pass for the Huskies this past season was Tulane transfer Kai Horton, who completed four of seven passes for 13 yards.\n            ",

Alabama lost 38-3 in the quarterfinals against Indiana. He ranks 30th overall in CBS Sports' 2026 NFL Draft Prospect Rankings and is the No. 3 quarterback, behind Indiana's Fernando Mendoza and Oregon's Dante Moore.Simpson, a redshirt junior, got off to a strong start to the season and had thrown 21 touchdowns and just one interception through the Crimson Tide's first nine games. However, he struggled in Alabama's regular-season loss to Oklahoma in mid-November and threw two interceptions in a blowout win over FCS opponent Eastern Illinois the next week. He also completed fewer than half of his passes in an SEC Championship Game loss to Georgia. Though he played well in the Crimson Tide's CFP comeback against Oklahoma, he and the entire Alabama team were overwhelmed by Indiana in the season-ending loss.\nSimpson, 23, received All-SEC second-team recognition from both the media and the coaches.\n            \n    ",

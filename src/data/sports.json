It has also generated a betting profit of over $2,000 for $100 players on its top-rated college spread football picks.

Anybody following its college football betting, NBA betting and NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Thursday's college football, NBA and NFL best bets at BetMGMBroncos -8.5 vs. Raiders (-118) UTSA money line vs. USF (+400)Under 224.5 points in Suns vs. Clippers (-110)Combining these three picks into a Thursday college football, NBA and NFL parlay at BetMGM would result in a payout of +1763 (risk $100 to win $1763). Bet it at BetMGM Sportsbook here:\nBroncos -8.5 vs. Raiders (-118)\"The Raiders allowed the Jaguars to score on six consecutive drives to end Sunday's 30-29 home loss in overtime. Las Vegas' defense was on the field for a whopping 77 plays. Bo Nix has played well against the NFL's softer defenses, and this matchup qualifies,\" SportsLine NFL handicapper Larry Hartstein said. \"Especially with the Raiders, on a short week, traveling to altitude. Geno Smith has Brock Bowers back, but he struggles when pressured. Now he has to deal with the league's top pass rush. I would lay anything less than 10.\" Back Denver at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Under 224.5 points in Suns vs. Clippers (-110)\"The Clippers have had an uneven start to the new season and now have some other concerns for tonight, specifically James Harden and Kawhi Leonard, both ruled out. The Clips could probably live without Harden, but not Kawhi, whose added dimensions are difficult to replace,\" SportsLine NBA handicapper Bruce Marshall said. \"Add Norman Powell's offseason departure to Miami and can see Ty Lue's short-term dilemma. We're hardly sure perimeter-oriented Phoenix takes advantage, and totals-wise, this one doesn't seem to have shootout written all over it, with the Suns hoping that G Jalen Green finally makes his debut tonight (we'll sse), while the Clips have performed somewhat erratically.  \" Back the Under at BetMGM Sportsbook now:UTSA money line vs. USF (+400)The model predicts that USF wins this game 59% of the time, but you're getting incredible value here with UTSA winning in 41% of simulations. That's more than double the implied win probability of 20% at this price. USF lost to Memphis to effectively end its chances of making the College Football Playoff and has had a bye week to stew in it. Meanwhile, UTSA has won four of six and routed Tulane 48-26 last week and Jeff Traylor's squad also beat Alex Golesh's 49-21 when they last played in 2023. Back UTSA at BetMGM Sportsbook now:\nWant more NFL picks?You've seen some of the model's best bets for Thursday.

    "body": "\nThe Dallas Cowboys are still coming to terms the death of defensive end Marshawn Kneeland, who died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound on Thursday. Hours after the news broke, quarterback Dak Prescott spoke about what had been an emotional day.Back in his hometown of Haughton, Louisiana, during the Cowboys' bye week, Prescott said he's dealt with a lot of \"pain\" since learning of Kneeland's passing. The Cowboys' quarterback said his heart has been with everyone including the 24-year-old Kneeland, his family and his teammates.\"It's been a very tough day,\" Prescott said. \"As you said, it started earlier today, finding out the news. It's a tragic loss. I hurt. Heavy, heavy heart today. I hurt for Marshawn. I hurt for his family. I hurt for his girlfriend. I hurt for every single one of my teammates.\"This is a pain you don't wish upon anybody. You wish none of us had to go through with this. You wish Marshawn didn't have to go through what he went through. Just thankful for each moment we have in this life, and don't take it for granted. Hug and love on those that you do.\"Prescott was at his high school for a ceremony in which the football field was renamed in his honor. Prescott admitted that he dealt with a whirlwind of emotions all day, and shared an important message for anyone who may be struggling.\"It's okay to feel however you're feeling,\" Prescott said. \"I'll tell you first and foremost, I don't always have the answers. Today is not a day I felt like I had answers. Triggering day for many reasons, on top of knowing that this was ahead today. Hard to balance my emotions. Not a day that I have words, other than 'I love you' for friends and family and people who may be struggling.\"Even though the Cowboys were away from the facility on Thursday, they did jump on a Zoom call to console one another, Prescott said. When the team gets back together after the bye, Prescott said he will tell his teammates \"how I feel about them when I see them.\"Prescott has long been a vocal advocate for mental health and expressing emotions in a healthy manner. Back 2020, Prescott opened up about how his brother Jace took his own life at the age of 31. In the years that have followed, Prescott made a concerted effort to help others in similar situations. One Cowboys fan, who won International Fan of the Year in 2024, credited Prescott's advocacy for helping him get through his father's death. \n            ",

McIntosh and the rest of the athletic department will continue evaluating the program while committing to an increased level of investment. \"Chancellor [Jennifer] Mnookin and I are aligned on significantly elevating investment in our program to compete at highest level,\" McIntosh told ESPN. \"We are willing to make an investment in infrastructure and staff. As important, is our ability to retain and recruit players in a revenue share and NIL era.\"Fickell is 14-19 in three full seasons as Wisconsin's coach. He has not produced a winning record since 2023 and his Badgers have not won a Big Ten game since Oct. 19, 2024. They currently sit at 2-6 eight games into the 2025 campaign, including a 0-5 mark in conference play. Wisconsin's six losses have come by an average of 23.3 points per game. The Badgers have yet to score more than 14 points against a Power Four opponent and they have held just one power-conference team below 24 points this season. \nThis will likely mark a second-straight year without a bowl game for the Badgers, who had 22 consecutive postseason appearances from 2002-23. Wisconsin's losing record in 2024 also snapped its streak of 22-straight seasons finishing above .500. \"This season has caused us all to have to look from within,\" McIntosh said. \"Luke has had to do that. I've had to do that. He has a willingness to be better. So do I, and so does Wisconsin from an institutional perspective.\"Wisconsin's decision to retain Fickell is likely informed by -- in part, at least -- what has been a busy coaching carousel thus far. Were the Badgers to make a change, they would have to contend with a litany of powerhouse programs like Penn State, LSU, Florida and Auburn during the hiring process. \nFickell also touts a buyout that will sit around $25 million at season's end. \n            \n    ",

Hall went down in the first quarter of Saturday's SEC showdown, and was eventually ruled out.Hall has started in each of Georgia's first eight games, and recorded 12 tackles and two tackles for loss. The Jacksonville native was a five-star recruit who came to Athens as a member of the No. 2-ranked 2023 class. In 24 collegiate games played, he's recorded 26 tackles.Georgia's defense is allowing 309.4 total yards per game, which ranks No. 21 in the FBS and No. 2 in the SEC. This unit held the Gators to 2 of 11 on third downs without Hall, and just 281 yards of total offense.\nUp next for the Bulldogs is Mississippi State in Starkville on Saturday, with a historic streak on the line. Georgia has won 46 straight games vs. unranked teams, which is the longest active streak in the FBS. With a win this week, the Bulldogs will tie the second-longest win streak vs. unranked teams in the FBS over the last 30 years.

He was 71.Lowe was a College Football Hall of Fame player who starred for the Crimson Tide from 1972-75. The linebacker was one of the greatest players to excel under the tutelage of coach Bear Bryant, and he hauled in numerous accolades throughout an illustrious career. Lowe was a three-time first-team All-American and received a consensus nod in 1974. He remains one of two Alabama players to haul in first-team All-American selections in three different years.Lowe contributed to four nationally prominent Alabama teams, including the 1973 squad that won a national championship. Not once in his career did the Crimson Tide win fewer than 10 games, and each year Lowe's squads ranked in the top two of the AP Top 25. Alabama also won the SEC championship in each of his four seasons in the program.A full 50 years removed from his final snap in Tuscaloosa, Lowe's legacy is still very much present in the Alabama record books. He stands as the Crimson Tide's leader in single-season tackles with the 134 stops he recorded in 1973, and he ranks fourth in program history in career tackles with 315.It took no time at all for Lowe, a Phenix City, Alabama, native, to make an impact with the Crimson Tide. He earned a starting role in his first year on campus, taking advantage of the NCAA's new rule permitting freshmen to play varsity college football. Lowe was off to the races from there and shined over the ensuing three seasons, earning national honors every year until his departure for the NFL. His 315 career tackles were, at the time, a school record.The San Diego Chargers selected Lowe with the No. 131 overall pick in the 1976 NFL Draft. The fifth-round selection played 164 games at the pro level, earned a Pro Bowl nod in 1981 and was a team captain. The Chargers later named him to their 40th and 50th anniversary teams.Lowe embarked on a coaching career at the end of his time with the Chargers. He served on multiple NFL staffs, making stops with the Los Angeles Raiders and Kansas City Chiefs, and eventually returned to his hometown to become a high school assistant at his alma mater, Central. He then held head coaching positions over nine years at Selma, Smiths Station and Central.\n            \n    ",

The Pacers will sign veteran guard Monte Morris to fill the roster spot.McClung inked a multiyear deal with the Pacers on Oct. 28, marking the first standard NBA contract of his career. He spent the majority of his professional career on short-term and two-way deals and bounced between the G League and NBA with multiple franchises including the Los Angeles Lakers, Chicago Bulls, Philadelphia 76ers and Orlando Magic.The three games McClung spent with the Pacers were his most with one NBA team in a single season. He averaged 6.3 points across the three contests on 38.9% shooting with the vast majority of his production coming in the first two outings; he played just two minutes in the final game.\nWhile his NBA opportunities are limited, McClung made a reputation as a supreme athlete with elite dunking ability. He won the league's dunk contest at each of the last three All-Star weekends. McClung also boasts a track record as a G League standout and won the MVP award at the end of a stellar year with the Osceola Magic.McClung recorded perfect 50 scores on all but one dunk in the 2023 contest, in which he participated on a two-way contract with the 76ers. He repeated as champion the following year and made it three-straight titles in 2025, becoming the first player in NBA history to do so. His three dunk crowns match those of Nate Robinson -- the only other player to ever win the contest three times.\nWhen the Pacers signed McClung, they waived former No. 2 overall pick James Wiseman to make room on the roster. Morris is now the second player to fill Wiseman's old roster spot and will offer guard depth to a squad that thus far has been a revolving door in the backcourt. The Pacers will move forward without McClung as they seek to dig themselves out of a 1-7 hole. They stand with the Brooklyn Nets and Washington Wizards at the bottom of the Eastern Conference standings, tied for the worst record in the NBA.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\nDallas Cowboys defensive end Marshawn Kneeland, 24, died Thursday morning. Kneeland's cause of death is said to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound following a police chase for a traffic violation, according to the Frisco Police Department and Texas Department of Public Safety.While pursuing Kneeland as he chose not to stop amid his traffic violation, DPS officers lost sight of his vehicle. When Kneeland's automobile was eventually found, it appeared to have been involved in an accident. Police subsequently found Kneeland, deceased at the time of discovery, while searching the surrounding area.\"Initial reports indicated that a male subject, later identified as 24-year-old Marshawn Kneeland of Plano, TX fled the scene on foot. Officers established a perimeter and initiated a search of the area with the assistance of the FPD K-9 and Drone units. During the course of the search, officers received information that Kneeland had expressed suicidal ideations. Kneeland was later located at 1:31 a.m., deceased with what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound,\" Frisco Police shared in a statement.A Plano Police Department spokesperson said officers had earlier responded to a \"welfare concern\" at Kneeland's residence at 11:40 p.m. on Wednesday but did not make contact with anyone at that time.Police received calls from Kneeland's girlfriend and the NFL, according to dispatch audio posted by TMZ. Kneeland's girlfriend said she received a concerning message from Kneeland, who was armed with a history of mental issues, claiming he would \"end it all.\" The NFL expressed that it had been contacted by family, sharing that Kneeland was texting them \"goodbye.\"Kneeland's family shared their despair in a statement released to the media: \"We are devastated by this tremendous loss and are still processing the depth of our grief. As Marshawn was making his mark on the football field with the Dallas Cowboys, he held an even more special place off the field — as a devoted son, brother, uncle, cousin, nephew, grandson and friend. He was kind, determined, humble, and full of love. His light shone brightly in every life he touched, and his spirit will continue to live on through the countless hearts he inspired.\"We are deeply grateful for the outpouring of love and support from friends, fans and the community. During this difficult time, we ask for privacy as we come together as a family to honor and remember Marshawn's life and legacy.\"The Cowboys related their thoughts in a team statement: \"It is with extreme sadness that the Dallas Cowboys share that Marshawn Kneeland tragically passed away this morning. Marshawn was a beloved teammate and member of our organization. Our thoughts and prayers regarding Marshawn are with his girlfriend Catalina and his family.\"Prior to Thursday night's Week 10 matchup between the Las Vegas Raiders and the Denver Broncos, the NFL held a moment of silence for Kneeland:\nA 2024 second-round pick, Kneeland was in the middle of his second season in Dallas. He recorded his first career sack in Week 1 against Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts. During Kneeland's last game against the Arizona Cardinals -- in prime time on \"Monday Night Football\" -- he recovered a blocked punt in the end zone for his first career touchdown. The Cowboys lost, 27-17.Kneeland enjoyed a successful prep and college career, including a standout effort as a linebacker/tight end at Michigan's Godwin Heights High School and a second-team All-Mid-American Conference selection during his final season at Western Michigan, where he registered 57 tackles (7.5 for loss), 4.5 sacks and two forced fumbles. \"He was a great person, eager  to learn ... wanted to be great,\" one of Kneeland's former coaches, Mike Zimmer, told NFL Media. \"He didn't take any crap from anyone on the field. He studied hard -- loved playing the game. My last conversation with him was, 'Keep being you. You're going to have a great career.'\"\n            ",

Rookie running backs Ashton Jeanty and RJ Harvey could factor into an NFL SGP considering their early success thus far, while one of last year's top rookies in Brock Bowers will as well after hitting all of the Overs with his prop bets last week. Bowers posted a 12-127-3 stat line, catching three of Geno Smith's four touchdown passes. A Thursday Night Football SGP could also consider vets like Courtland Sutton and J.K. Dobbins as they face Vegas' No. 23 scoring defense.Meanwhile, Denver has an elite defense that is top five in both points allowed and yards allowed. The Broncos held Bowers to just four grabs for 38 yards when he last faced them, and the star TE has an NFL props bar of 69.5 yards and 6.5 receptions for Thursday.

    "body": "\n        The Week 10 NFL schedule kicks with the Denver Broncos vs. the Las Vegas Raiders in an AFC West showdown on 'Thursday Night Football.' The games starts at 8:15 p.m. ET, and daily Fantasy football players will have to be creative when looking for production since this game only has an over/under of 42.5, the fourth lowest of the week. Denver has an elite defense, while Las Vegas has struggled offensively, so can you trust Las Vegas players like Geno Smith, Brock Bowers or Ashton Jeanty as NFL DFS picks?On the Denver side, Bo Nix, Courtland Sutton and JK Dobbins will all be popular for NFL DFS lineups. Meanwhile, with Vegas just trading away Jakobi Meyers, could Raheem Mostert be more of a factor out of the backfield in the passing game? Before locking in any NFL DFS picks on sites like DraftKings and FanDuel, be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure. New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in bonus entries when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.McClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings.

The second-year pro was dominant as a rookie, but has been limited by injuries in 2025. He got back on the field in Week 9, however, and put up a massive 12-127-3 receiving line against the Jaguars. Denver's defense is elite, but the Broncos have given opposing tight ends a little space as they ranked outside the top 10 in Fantasy points given up against the position, so Bowers is one Las Vegas player who could do some damage on Thursday. See who else to roster at SportsLine.Another one of McClure's NFL DFS picks is Broncos running back J.K. Dobbins, who has an over/under of 71.5 rushing yards. Dobbins hasn't been much of a touchdown threat, but he's been a high-floor option in recent weeks due to his total workload. He's averaging more than 14 carries per game over the past three weeks, and he's averaged an efficient 5.2 yards per carry during that span. With Denver favored by more than a touchdown, there's a good chance that the game flow will allow him to see plenty of carries. Additionally, the Raiders allowed Travis Etienne of Jacksonville to go for 115 scrimmage yards last week. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to set NFL DFS lineups for Raiders vs. BroncosMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Thursday Night Football.'

    "body": "\n        The final month of the regular season is always filled with posturing from teams and conferences vying for College Football Playoff spots, and coaches already began standing up for their leagues in the hunt for postseason berths. Prior to the debut CFP Top 25 rankings reveal, it was Texas' Steve Sarkisian championing three-loss SEC teams as playoff candidates. And after the rankings were unveiled, Nebraska's Matt Rhule spoke in defense of the Big Ten.Rhule specifically pointed to the quartet of two-loss teams in his conference and vouched for them in their respective quests for CFP bids. If one of the squads in that bunch – No. 19 USC, No. 20 Iowa, No. 21 Michigan and No. 23 Washington -- got into the bracket, the Big Ten could have four teams represented in the race for the national championship.\"I think the Big Ten teams with two losses are underappreciated,\" Rhule said on \"The Pat McAfee Show.\" \"I think Iowa's having a heck of a season. I think SC is having a heck of a season, and many more. Michigan is at 7-2. … I do think there are some really good teams in the Big Ten. We deserve four in.\"The CFP selection committee views each of the Big Ten's two-loss teams similarly and effectively grouped them into a tier in its first batch of rankings. The committee respects those squads as playoff contenders but, for the moment, has them on the outside looking in at the 12-team bracket. It also placed them behind two-loss teams from all of the other power conferences, sending a clear message that their résumés are weaker than some of their SEC, ACC and Big 12 counterparts'.Those modest rankings for the Trojans, Hawkeyes, Wolverines and Huskies make their paths to the playoff fairly clear; they will likely need to win out and finish the regular season at 10-2 in order to clinch a berth.\n\n    \n                                        \n    USC TrojansUSC and Iowa will sort themselves out because they go head-to-head on Nov. 15 in what will be a de facto playoff elimination game. From there, the road gets even trickier for the Trojans as they must also get past No. 9 Oregon and do so in Autzen Stadium. With victories over the Hawkeyes and Ducks, USC would likely be one of the most accomplished two-loss teams in the country. Of course, Lincoln Riley's crew must first take care of business Friday against Northwestern and finish things off on Nov. 29 with a rivalry win over UCLA.\n    \n                                        \n    Iowa HawkeyesThe rubber meets the road this week for Iowa, which hosts Oregon at 3:30 p.m. ET on CBS. Kinnick Stadium already proved daunting for one playoff hopeful in No. 2 Indiana, which played its worst game of the year in a narrow 20-15 win over the Hawkeyes in September. If the Hawkeyes spring a trap for the Ducks, the only things standing between them and their first trip to the CFP would be tricky road games at USC and Nebraska and a home date with Michigan State. A splashy win over the Ducks may also give them margin for error down the line as a potential three-loss playoff hopeful.\n    \n                                        \n    Michigan WolverinesWith all due respect to Northwestern and Maryland, whom the Wolverines face in their next two outings, there is only one real résumé-building opportunity remaining on Michigan's schedule: the regular-season finale against No. 1 Ohio State. The Wolverines will be betting underdogs when their bitter rivals visit Ann Arbor, but if the last four years taught the college football world anything, it is to throw expectations out the window for The Game. Sherrone Moore seemingly has Ohio State's number, and this year he duels with Ryan Day's Buckeyes at home. A fifth-straight win in the series would be the cherry on top of a 10-2 season, which almost certainly gets Michigan into the field.\n\n    \n                                        \n    Washington HuskiesWashington might be the sneakiest CFP contender nobody is talking about. The Huskies' 3-2 conference record has them sitting in the middle of the pack on the Big Ten leaderboard, but in a few weeks' time, they could be much closer to the top. They project as comfortable favorites over Wisconsin, Purdue and UCLA, and if they scorch through that stretch, they will set up a monumental rivalry battle with Oregon on their home turf. It would be a de facto play-in game for Jedd Fisch, who could then become the third different coach to take Washington to the playoff.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 NWSL playoffs have arrived, and eight teams will step into a three-week journey where legacies are forged not only by star power but by the emergence of the unsung hero. Fans can watch the NWSL playoffs across CBS platforms, as the Washington Spirit vs. Racing Louisville FC face off for a spot in the semifinals (Saturday on CBS at 12:30 p.m. ET)While the spotlight throughout the season naturally shines on the league's leading scorers or veteran stalwarts, the postseason is a unique stage to showcase the relentless defenders, super-sub forwards, or underrated midfielders. It's the time of year when that quiet season of consistency can break through a playoff-saving tackle or a game-winning goal. Any team that has arrived at this point will say it's a total team effort, and if that's indeed the case, who are the unsung heroes across the rosters ready to seize the opportunity for NWSL playoff glory?Here's who to keep an eye on during the NWSL playoffs:QuarterfinalsFriday, Nov. 7Orlando Pride vs. Seattle Reign, 8 p.m. (Prime Video)Saturday, Nov. 8Washington Spirit vs. Racing Louisville, 12 p.m. (CBS, Paramount+)\nSunday, Nov. 9Kansas City Current vs. Gotham FC, 12:30 p.m. (ABC)Portland Thorns vs. San Diego Wave, 3 p.m. (ABC)SemifinalsMatches to take place during the weekend of Nov. 15 and 16Kansas City Current/Gotham FC vs. Orlando Pride/Seattle Reign, time TBAWashington Spirit/Racing Louisville vs. Portland Thorns/San Diego Wave, time TBAFinalSaturday, Nov. 22Teams TBD, 8 p.m. (CBS. Paramount+)Emma Sears (Racing Louisville FC)You might think a player scoring ten goals in a season is a star and not an unsung hero, and you're correct. Unless you're deeply tapped into women's soccer, you know Emma Sears, but many out there are just learning the name for the first time in 2025. Sears has rapidly become the leading goal scorer for Racing Louisville following an impressive rookie season in 2024, where she scored five goals, and her sophomore season of elevated attacking production has been crucial to their success.Her efforts haven't gone unnoticed by the U.S. women's national team, with more frequent call-ups this year by head coach Emma Hayes this year. Sears is stepping into the playoffs following a massive hat-trick performance against New Zealand last month.\n\"She has an instinct inside the box and a desire to score goals that we can't teach,\" Hayes said of Sears' recent USWNT start. \"To score a hat trick at the international level is no easy achievement. She is someone who always continues to impress.\"While a huge part of Louisville's identity is making games competitive and not so much ballooning scorelines, it's on par with what to expect come NWSL playoffs. It's frightening to think now that Racing has finally made the postseason that's long eluded them, that is a series tailor-made for how they operate this season. A squad that is peaking at the right time, fearless, with nothing to lose, and a winger who can score at any moment. \"I can feel the belief behind me on the field, and I think I'm really just leaning into that,\" Sears said during the playoff push. \n\"I try not to think too much and take what opportunities I can during the games ... in the second half of the season I've been presented with more opportunities in games than I really can remember in my career and just trying to kind of flow with that and not think about it too much.\"Sarah Schupansky (Gotham FC)As Gotham FC steps into the playoffs as a No. 8 seed, it's not quite unfamiliar territory for them. When playoffs were a six-team format, the club ran the postseason to lift the NWSL Championship as the No. 6 seed, and they've since been league contenders. This year, for the group, it'll be about which rookie will step up.Sarah Schupansky is just one of several rookies whom Gotham has relied upon this year. Alongside Lily Reale, the duo could be rookie of the year finalists. Meanwhile, Khyah Harper, Ryan Campbell, Sofia Cook, Emerson Elgin, Tyler McCamey, Josefine Hasbo, and Kayla Duran are part of Gotham's deep roster. Through 23 matches, Schupansky leads the team in chances created (29) and assists (five).\nThe impressive play led to a new contract extension in September through 2027. Though her time on the pitch has dwindled in recent match weeks, the playoffs are a rejuvenator, and Schupansky's skills could be a difference maker on the road against Kansas City.Gia Corley (San Diego Wave FC)The 2025 regular season was going to be a year of transition, and San Diego Wave FC went ahead rode that storyline right into the playoffs. After a surge of international talent signed in the offseason from France internationals Kenza Dali and Perle Morroni to new head coach Jonas Eidevall, the group is back in the postseason after a one-year absence.One player who has gone under the radar, as Delphine Cascarino emerged as the most important player on the team and Dali composed had a career year, is another new arrival, Gia Corely. The 23-year-old midfielder was signed from TSG Hoffenheim with a proven track record, with 14 goals scored and 12 assists in 70 appearances in the Frauen Bundesliga. She needed little time to adjust to NWSL play and scored in her Wave FC debut, and has since shown off her creativity and vision. \nSam Meza (Seattle Riegn FC)Not sure anyone works harder within Seattle's five-back than midfielder Sam Meza. Her rapid ascension as a key midfielder for the Reign is anchored by her two-way play and relentless ball tracking. Only in her sophomore season in NWSL, her nose for the ball and staunch dominance in midfield areas are leading factors in Seattle's ability to stifle games. Meza leads the team in recoveries (157), duels (289), and leads all club midfielders in shot blocks (14). While her defensive work rate is relentless and standout, she can also contribute in attacking scenarios through her distribution. If Seattle's postseason journey is about its defensive shifts, Meza's instinctive play will be crucial for a deep playoff run.Haley McCutcheon (Orlando Pride)As the Orlando Pride begin their title defence in the 2025 NWSL Playoffs, they'll do so with the foundational piece of their midfield, Haley McCutcheon. Since joining the Pride in 2022, she's offered both consistency and leadership for the group and will be an essential piece in Orlando's midfield puzzle. \nShe's effective in and out of possession, leading the team in assists (four) and duels (230). Her clutch mentality is backed by her reliable performances, shutting down attacking sequences or generating offensive play. Orlando's recent form gives positive momentum, with a five-game unbeaten streak, and McCutcheon's ability to impact the game across the middle third is why.Reilyn Turner (Portland Thorns FC)While there were plenty of question marks around where the offensive production was going to come from for the Thorns with Sophia Wilson off on maternity leave, Reilyn Turner answered. The 23-year-old forward elevated her game in her second NWSL season and leads the Thorns forwards with five goals this year. She's got a poacher's mentality, and her tenacity makes her a constant threat to opposing defenders. Her extended work rate and commitment to counter pressing expand her impact on the game and show no fear in big moments. She's also a threat in the air and leads the roster in aerial duels (86) and won nearly 70% of her aerial challenges. Her offensive production will be a boost in the playoffs, and her positioning will open channels up for others. \nRosemonde Kouassi (Washington Spirit)In year two with the Washington Spirit, Ivory Coast international Rosemonde Kouassi has quickly become an integral piece of the squad's attack. The Spirit have had to get creative this season as they managed a carousel of varying injuries to significant players. Kousassi's ability to plug in and go offers the roster extra confidence in the final third. The 23-year-old attacker has four goals and four assists this season over 17 appearances, and offers a dynamic option in the final third as the Spirit rotates attackers to manage injury loads. She's effective on the ball and often successful in taking on defenders one-on-one. If the Spirit remain without Trinity Rodman due to an MCL sprain, they'll have confidence in the playoffs with Kouassi as an option.Izzy Rodriguez (Kansas City Current)After winning the 2025 NWSL Shield, the Kansas City Current turn their sights towards the 2025 NWSL Championship. They have a roster with multiple game-changing players, even without their Golden Boot winner, Temwa Chawinga, but fullback Izzy Rodriguez provides for all. The former 2022 fourth-round draft pick has slowly become a bona fide starter for the Current, and she can execute in nearly every facet of the game. \nA tenacious presence on the backline, she's able to ignite attacks from lower on the pitch. She leads the team in assists (six) and chances created (39) and is as effective on the defensive end of the ball as she is during offensive scenarios. Rodriguez has an added layer to her game with her accuracy on set pieces, and her deliveries into the box off corners or free kicks often create chaos and goals.\n            ",

However, he has scored six touchdowns in his first eight games, and he has scored five of those touchdowns in his last five outings. The model predicts that he scores 0.70 touchdowns on average, while his odds imply a 45.5% chance to score. Use the latest bet365 bonus code to find this price and get $200 in bonus bets after your first $5 wager win or lose.Courtland Sutton, Broncos (+150, FanDuel)Bo Nix's inconsistency this season might not have impacted Denver's bottom line, but it has impacted Sutton's productivity to an extent. He's had three one-catch games so far this season, including last week in a win over the Texans. However, that one catch against Houston was a touchdown, and he has scored four times this year. Sutton has six career touchdowns against Las Vegas (second-most against any NFL team), and the model predicts that he scores 0.57 touchdowns on average, while the odds imply a 40% chance to score. Use the latest FanDuel promo code to find this price and get $150 in bonus bets if your first $5 wager wins.RJ Harvey, Broncos (+225, bet365)The rookie running back plays a clear second fiddle to J.K. Dobbins on the depth chart, but Sean Payton has found a clear role for the second-down pick as a change-of-pace player and has used his short-area quickness to scheme up mismatches in the red zone. Harvey has now scored five touchdowns in his last three games and is up to six total touchdowns on the season. The model predicts that he scores 0.63 touchdowns on average, which more than doubles his 30.8% implied chance to score. Get $200 in bonus bets after your first $5 wager, win or lose, with the latest bet365 bonus code.  Want more Thursday Night Football picks?You've seen the model's NFL anytime touchdown prop picks for several players in Broncos vs. Raiders.

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 offseason in Major League Baseball is fully underway, which means we're gradually ticking off the dates on our offseason calendar. That also means a steady supply of rumors, most of which center on free agency and trades (along with the occasional hiring and firing). Speaking of which, you can find Thursday's supply just below. DePodesta in line for Rockies jobThe Colorado Rockies are still in search of a manager for 2026, but more fundamentally they're also in need of a lead decision-maker atop baseball operations. On that front, Paul DePodesta, the former Dodgers general manager and current exec for the NFL's Cleveland Browns, will be named to the post, according to The Athletic. The 52-year-old DePodesta, who first rose to prominence while working under Billy Beane with the Moneyball-era Oakland A's, was at the helm for the Dodgers for the 2004 and 2005 seasons before being dismissed. Then came front-office stints with the San Diego Padres and New York Mets. Since early 2016, he's served as chief strategy officer for the Browns. The Rockies have logged seven straight losing seasons and in 2025 endured one of the worst seasons in MLB history with a record of 43-119. Along the way, they were outscored by more than 400 runs. Those depths prompted an ongoing effort to modernize the front office. In early October, general manager Bill Schmidt resigned his post after 26 years in the organization. The Rockies have not hired a lead executive from outside the organization for the first time since 1999, but DePodesta is poised to change that. \nO's kick off free agency with Taveras signingIt's not a major signing, but it is indeed pairing of team and free agent, which means the offseason has arrived in earnest. The Orioles have reached an agreement with veteran outfielder Leody Taveras on a contract, reports MLB.com.\nTaveras, 27, is a switch-hitter who can play center and has some speed on the bases. For his career, he has an OPS+ of 84 across parts of six MLB seasons with the Rangers and Mariners. He's likely to fill the fourth outfielder role in Baltimore for 2026. \nMattingly eyeing managerial vacancies?Don Mattingly is leaving his post as the Blue Jays' bench coach coming off the team's World Series loss to the Dodgers, the team announced Thursday. The motivation isn't retirement but rather Mattingly's possible pursuit of a different job, according to the New York Post. At the time of the report, two remaining managerial vacancies remained, though the Padres have since hired former reliever Craig Stammen. The Rockies are still in need of a manager for 2026. Mattingly boasts plenty of managerial experience, as he previously skippered the Dodgers and then Marlins for a total of 12 seasons. Over that span, Mattingly amassed a record of 889-950 (.483) in the dugout and led the Dodgers to three straight division titles and the Marlins to a postseason berth during the abbreviated 2020 season.\n            ",

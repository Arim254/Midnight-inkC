The Mariners closed the regular season 17-4, including winning 17 of 18 games before dropping their final three contests to the Dodgers, and continue their red-hot finish into the postseason. After dropping Game 1 of the ALDS in 11 innings, Seattle has won five of its last six games entering Wednesday. Mariners starter George Kirby has a 2.30 ERA over his last five starts, including a 2.70 ERA in two postseason contests. The model projects the Mariners to win in 61% of simulations to take a commanding 3-0 lead in the ALCS. Back the Mariners at DraftKings, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Jacksonville State (+124) to defeat DelawareThe Gamecocks turned to freshman quarterback Caden Creel for his first start last week, and he rewarded the coaches by rushing for 132 yards and a touchdown on 24 carries while completing 13 of 17 passes for 129 yards in a 29-27 road victory over Sam Houston. Creel also helped get the best rushing performance of the season from Cam Cook, a junior transfer from TCU who now leads the nation at 832 rushing yards. Cook ran for 218 yards and two touchdowns on 7.0 yards per rush last week. Jacksonville State is third in the nation on rush attempts per game (49.6), and despite teams thinking they know what type of play is coming, the Gamecocks are 14th in the nation in yards per rush (5.4). The model projects this rushing attack to be too much for Delaware, which is allowing 4.4 yards per rush (74th in the nation), and the Gamecocks cover the spread in 70% of simulations. Back Jacksonville State at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Sam Houston (+114) to defeat UTEPThe Bearkats are coming off their best game of their 0-6 start, keeping pace with defending Conference USA champion Jacksonville State in a 29-27 loss last week on a 52-yard field goal as time expired. Hunter Watson completed 12 of 19 passes for 136 yards and three touchdowns while rushing for 52 yards. Alton McCaskill added 87 yards on 14 carries (6.2 yards per rush) and Chris Reed had two touchdown receptions. The model projects Sam Houston to take some of those game positives into a matchup against a 1-5 UTEP team. Sam Houston is home, where the Bearkats have performed better this year, and the model projects Sam Houston to win in 64% of simulations against a UTEP team with the 129th scoring offense (14 ppg) in college football this season. Back Sam Houston at DraftKings, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Want more college football picks and MLB picks?You've seen the model's Wednesday best bets.

Erstwhile manager Brandon Hyde was fired with the team's record sitting at 15-28 on May 17.

It was reported that James was ramping up his workload to prepare for the Lakers' season opener against the Golden State Warriors on Oct. 21. However, his timeline to return has been pushed back, meaning he will miss his team's first game of the season for the first time in his 23-year career.\n        \n            \n                LeBron James injury ripple effects: Luka Dončić's MVP case gets stronger, Bronny in Lakers' rotation?\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIf James is indeed out until mid-November, it's possible he would miss the first 10-15 games of the season. The Lakers have a five-game road trip starting in Atlanta against the Hawks on Nov. 8 and don't play back in Los Angeles until Nov. 18 against the Utah Jazz. That game against the Hawks will be L.A.'s 10th game of the season.\nNotably, NBA awards such as MVP, Defensive Player of the Year and All-NBA require players to play in at least 65 games. James averaged 24.4 points, 7.8 rebounds and 8.2 assists in 70 games played during the 2024-25 season, en route to earning Second-Team All-NBA honors.\n            \n    ",

The fourth overall pick in the 2022 NBA Draft was set to become a restricted free agent next summer, but this new deal locks him in with Sacramento through the 2030-31 season.The hope is that Murray can return to the version of himself that averaged 15.2 points on 35.8% from 3-point range in his sophomore season. He looked like a solid 3-and-D threat that season, but his numbers took a dive last season (12.4 points, 34.3% from deep), in part due to all of the changes around him on the roster with the additions of DeMar DeRozan and Zach LaVine, and the departure of De'Aaron Fox. There was also the firing of Mike Brown and promoting Doug Christie to the lead position, which certainly contributed to Murray's third-year slump. But with a full offseason with this roster and coaching staff, Murray could certainly return to form. Unfortunately, though, he'll be starting the season on the injured list after suffering a torn ligament in his thumb which will keep him sidelined for 4-6 weeks. That's a massive loss out the gate for the Kings. But in the long-term, locking Murray into an extension is a win for a franchise that has seemed directionless over recent years.\n        \n            \n                Kings remain directionless with Russell Westbrook signing: How Sacramento can escape pit of mediocrity\n                \n                    Cameron Salerno                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMurray's extension comes on the heels of the team signing veteran guard Russell Westbrook to a deal on Wednesday, adding him to an already overcrowded backcourt. It's unclear how Westbrook will fit on this roster, or what minutes he'll get given the team already employs Dennis Schröder, Malik Monk and Keon Ellis. But that's small potatoes when you consider all the bad moves the Kings have made over the years (like trading Tyrese Haliburton).\nSigning Murray to an extension was the smart move. Either the Kings can see how Murray continues to develop, or he becomes a valuable trade chip for a contending team looking for size on the perimeter who is a career 37.2% 3-point shooter. Murray holds the Kings record for most 3s made in a single game (12), according CBS Sports research. He also broke the NBA rookie record for most 3-pointers in a season (206) and is one of just three players to post at least 500 3-pointers, 150 blocks and 150 steals over the last three seasons. The other two players in that category are Anthony Edwards and Derrick White, pretty good company to be in for the fourth-year forward. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Through six weeks of the NFL season, it's hard to find a team who doesn't have a serious question mark. Two weeks ago, we would've been raving about the undefeated Eagles and Bills. Now both teams have lost two straight games. How about Lamar Jackson and the Ravens, one of the preseason favorites? With Jackson having been out each of the last two weeks, Baltimore enters its bye week 1-5 and is in serious danger of missing the postseason. Even the three-time defending AFC champion Chiefs aren't immune. They sit 3-3 heading into a Week 7 home date with AFC rival Las Vegas, though Kansas City is the largest favorite of the week at -11.5.Which teams would you take today to make the Super Bowl? Before the contenders start to separate from the pretenders, unpredictability in the NFL will continue to reign supreme. Week 7's 15 game slate should tell us plenty.

The Eagles struggled mightily on defense last week, and it's uncertain if cornerback Quinyon Mitchell (hamstring) will be back this week. \"I think it's fair to call this game a must win for Philadelphia coming off two straight losses. We've already seen one Eastern Pennsylvania team fire a successful head coach (Penn State, James Franklin), and while I don't think Nick Sirianni's job is in imminent danger considering he most recently won the Super Bowl, a third straight loss will turn up the heat a bit. Coming off a bye week and with a brutal stretch ahead, this game might be a must win for Minnesota as well. This is the type of game where I would bet both sides +7.5 at something like -125 odds and prepare for a close game no matter who wins. My coin flip says Philly's misery continues for another week. Vikings 23, Eagles 21\". See his other Week 7 football score predictions at SportsLine.How to make Week 7 NFL score predictionsIn addition, Cohen is picking one game to fly over the projected total. You can see who it is at SportsLine, and use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for just $1.Who wins every Week 7 NFL game, and which game is a must bet for the over?

He already missed three games this season due to an ankle injury.\"It's getting there. I wouldn't say it's 100 percent,\" McCarthy said.If it was up to McCarthy, who returned to practice on Monday and was a limited participant Wednesday, he would play when the Vikings (3-2) host the Philadelphia Eagles (4-2) on Sunday.\"We've got to be smart and understand there's a lot of things that go on. I'm just going to do what I'm told and try to get better,\" McCarthy said.\nThe Eagles, who are on a two-game losing streak, would go up against Carson Wentz if McCarthy can't play. Wentz, who the Eagles picked No. 2 overall in the 2016 draft, started in place of McCarthy the last three weeks. Both McCarthy and Wentz, who was a full participant practice while nursing a sore shoulder, can expect plenty of work in practice. \"I'm having a blast coaching [McCarthy],\" coach Kevin O'Connell said. \"It started last week, when he was able to really start ramping up a little bit. That 1-on-1 work, and then obviously the work he does with [quarterback coaches Josh McCown and Jordan Traylor] is going to be critical.\"O'Connell previously said McCarthy would need to practice for a full week before he gets clearance to play. In three games, Wentz leads Minnesota in passing with a 69% completion rate, 759 yards, five touchdowns and two interceptions. McCarthy's two appearances feature a 58.5% passing clip, 301 yards, two touchdowns and three interceptions.\n\"I think the big thing is just getting him back on the grass, in uniform, practicing, getting real live reps of a pass rush and taking drops and applying some of the things that he's worked really hard on as of late, as he's kind of gotten to that phase of his rehab,\" O'Connell said.\n            ",

Couple that with a number of upsets, including the Thursday night New York Giants win over the Philadelphia Eagles 34-17, and many survivor pool players' hopes are in tatters. For those still alive, this week's schedule does give them a number of options to be able to move on. Among the likely targets for NFL survivor players this week include Packers vs. Cardinals (+6.5), Buccaneers vs. Lions (-5.5) on 'Monday Night Football,' Patriots (-7) vs. Titans and Broncos (-7) vs. Giants.Meanwhile, the Kansas City Chiefs will look to battle their way back to the top of the AFC West standings when they take on the visiting Las Vegas Raiders. Las Vegas is 2-4 on the year and fourth in the AFC West, while the Chiefs are third at 3-3. Kansas City enters as an 11.5-point favorite, the largest line of the week, so the Chiefs will be an appealing option for those who can still use them.

The Rams are 3-point and -154 money-line favorites, as one of the road favorites in the Week 7 lines. They are coming off a 17-3 win over the Baltimore Ravens as Matthew Stafford completed 17 of 26 passes for 181 yards and one touchdown. The Jaguars, meanwhile, are off to a 4-2 start following a 20-12 loss to the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday. Fading the Rams may also be part of a greater NFL survivor pool strategy, which sees the Rams play a struggling Saints team in a couple of weeks.

Simmons, the No. 32 overall pick in this year's out of Ohio State, returned home to California prior to Kansas City's \"Sunday Night Football\" matchup against Detroit.Simmons was expected to play throughout the week but was abruptly listed as \"questionable\" with the team using the \"personal\" designation Sunday afternoon. A few hours later, Simmons was downgraded to out.When asked by reporters about Simmons' status or if there was a timeline for his return to the team, Reid declined comment and deferred to general manager Brett Veach, who he said is \"handling everything there.\" Likewise, Mahomes said little, electing to keep the matter of if he and Simmons had spoken private.\n\"I'll keep conversations kind of between us,\" Mahomes told reporters. \"But I'm  always praying for him. I'm praying for all my teammates, so I'm always  praying for him. I'll just keep everything else kind of private to us.\"\nWith Simmons out of the lineup, backup Jaylon Moore served as the Chiefs' starting left tackle and would be in line to continue serving in that role should Simmons miss more time.While Simmons remains absent, the Chiefs did get a positive update on right tackle Jawaan Taylor, as he was a full participant in practice despite dealing with a knee injury. Taylor has started all six games at right tackle for the Chiefs this season, and did so again in Week 6 despite his knee issue.\nNow 3-3 on the year after beating the Lions, the Chiefs will host the Las Vegas Raiders on Sunday. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The October international break has come to a close for the United States men's national team on a positive note, defeating Australia 2-1. Slowly, Mauricio Pochettino is restoring faith that this team can topple top opposition around the world as they're now on a three-match unbeaten run, and we're learning more about his roster by the day. The shift to a back three has been a positive one, and while questions may still remain around the team, panic is beginning to lessen.But with the World Cup drawing closer, it brings up an important question -- if the tournament started today, what would the starting XI look like? I took a stab at answering that, and here's how things shook out.2026 roster projection Goalkeepers (3): Matt Freese (New York City FC), Matt Turner (New England Revolution), Patrick Schulte (Columbus Crew)Defenders (8): Sergino Dest (PSV), Antonee Robinson (Fulham), Miles Robinson (FC Cincinnati), Chris Richards (Crystal Palace), Tim Ream (Fulham), Alex Freeman (Orlando City SC), Max Arfsten (Columbus Crew), Mark McKenzie (Toulouse)\nMidfielders (7): Weston McKennie (Juventus), Tyler Adams (Bournemouth), Diego Luna (Real Salt Lake), Luca De La Torre (San Diego FC), Cristian Roldan (Seattle Sounders), Malik Tillman (Bayer Leverkusen), Tanner Tessemann (Lyon)Forwards (6): Christian Pulisic (Milan), Folarin Balogun (Monaco), Ricardo Pepi (PSV), Tim Weah (Marseille), Patrick Agyemang (Derby County), Haji Wright (Coventry City), Alex Zendejas (Club America)GoalkeeperStarter: Matt FreeseBackups: Matt Turner, Patrick Schulte The year of Matt Freese continues with the keeper now starting 11 consecutive games for the USMNT between the Gold Cup and friendlies. Showing what he can do in penalty shootouts, even the return of Matt Turner wasn't enough to see Freese miss out on minutes between the sticks. Pochettino hasn't outright awarded the New York City FC man the starting job, but unless there's an injury or a major dip in performance, keeper is one of the few set positions for the USMNT as the World Cup approaches.\nRight wing backStarter: Sergino DestBackups: Alex Freeman, Tim WeahAnd just like that, we get to chaos. Tim Weah could easily continue in a fake wing back role where he helps overwhelm opposing attackers, especially since Sergino Dest hasn't been healthy enough to play a full 90 minutes for the USMNT this year. Dest's verisitlity could also work against him as he's one of the primary backups for Antonee Robinosn on the right, so if Pochettino needs to cut a wing back, it could make sense to have Dest as the primary backup on both sides. Alex Freeman has been one of the biggest risers in the entire squad during this year, and I'd find it tough to cut him from any potential World Cup squad.Center backStarters: Chris Richards, Tim Ream, Miles RobinsonBackups: Mark McKenzieThis is probably too light in central defense, but coming by defenders who have impressed enough to get the call to the World Cup has been tough. One of Tristan Blackmon or Cameron Carter-Vickers will likely be needed if the back three is hear to stay, but the starting trio feels locked in at this stage. Miles Robinson has been a strong performer under Pochettino, and alongside Richards, his anticipation helps make up for Tim Ream's lack of pace. While it'd be great to find a contingency plan for Ream if anything were to happen, that is something that could be easier said than done for this squad, so I wouldn't hold my breath there.Left wing backStarter: Antonee RobinsonBackup: Max Arfsten, Sergino DestAnother position where it's clear who the starter is, Antonee Robinson is one of the first names on the entire USMNT team sheet. Max Arfsten has had great showings as a wing back due to what he can bring going forward, but Robinson's consistency is what could cause issues in relation to the Columbus Crew man sticking on the roster. With Dest being able to back up both positions and the need for another center back, this is where Pochettino will have some decisions to make.\nCentral midfieldStarters: Tyler Adams, Weston McKennie Backups: Tanner Tessmann, Cristian Roldan, Luca De La Torre The defensive mistakes during the October international window, which Tyler Adams missed due to the birth of his child, showed yet again that no one can replace what he brings to the midfield. Adams captained the USMNT at the 2022 World Cup and is still one of the leaders on the pitch when healthy. Now, next to him is where things get interesting. Weston McKennie made his return to camp and would still seem to be the favorite to start, but with Cristian Roldan putting in good shifts and assisting Haji Wright twice, things could get interesting. There is a world where Roldan is the starting USMNT midfielder in a double pivot when the World Cup kicks off, especially as Pochettino called him a \"perfect player\" following the victory over Australia. Tanner Tessmann is trending in the right direction, but if only two deeper midfielders are starting, it will be tough to break into the starting XI.Attacking midfieldStarter: Malik TillmanBackups: Diego LunaWithout Gio Reyna in the squad, Malik Tillman becomes the x-factor for the USMNT. Able to play centrally and float out onto the wing, he brings versatility to how the attack can set up. Growing into his role at a bigger club at Bayer Leverkusen, Tillman is also developing more confidence as a player, which will help lead the USMNT attack when the lights are at their brightest. If a change of pace is needed, Diego Luna isn't afraid to take anyone on and will be ready for the moment. This is one of the few positions that doesn't change much in a back three or a back four.\nForwardsStarters: Folarin Balogun, Christian PulisicBackups: Tim Weah, Haji Wright, Ricardo Pepi, Patrick Agyemang, Alex ZendejasSitting Weah here is hard, as even when he's not at his best, the USMNT are better with him on the pitch. Weah very well may be played in defense, but he'll still be expected to contribute to the attack. Folarin Balogun has come into his own and brings a different class to the nine for the USMNT, raising the bar of what they can accomplish as a squad when he's on the pitch. It's similar to what Christian Pulisic brings which is why along with Robinson, they're locked in no matter what. Haji Wright has shown what he can bring coming off the bench or starting, and who knows, after being the last player to score a World Cup goal for the USMNT, he just may be the first player to score a goal in 2026 on home soil for the USMNT. \n            ",

The 18-year-old scored a remarkable goal from near the halfway line in a 3-0 victory for OL Lyonnes on Matchday 2 on Wednesday against St. Pölten. The young American signed with the French powerhouse in July and is rapidly making her mark with the club, scoring in the domestic league and now the Europe's most prestigious competition.Her move to eight-time Champions League winners Lyon signals the next step in her development, and her distant goal comes just hours after she was recently named to the USWNT October roster by Emma Hayes. \nYohannes also scored in her club debut in a win against Marseille in September. Her rise in the women's game is no secret as she's no stranger to the European stage. As just 16 years old, she became the youngest player to ever start a UWCL group stage match during her time with Ajax, making her also the youngest American to ever play in the tournament. Her creativity and poise in the midfield earned her the Johan Cruyff Talent of the Year award. \nOL head coach Jonatan Giraldez is already utilizing the young player in a starting capacity, and the teenager has a bright future ahead of her. OL Lyonnes will play their next Champions League in November and will face the Frauen Bundesliga team Wolfsburg at home in Groupama Stadium. All UWCL can be see Paramount+.\n            \n    ",

Tagogvailoa said that, while those comments were well-intended, he realizes now that it created an unneeded distraction for a Dolphins team that enters this Sunday's game against the Browns with a 1-5 record. \"I made a mistake, and I'm owning up to that right now,\" Tagovailoa said. The Dolphins' former Pro Bowl quarterback said that he has spoken to the team's other leaders about his comments while adding that they \"know that my intent was right.\" \n\"The intent can be right,\" he said, \"but when things get misconstrued or however the media wants to portray it, that leaves a void of silence and a lot of questions for the guys on our team now.\" In addition to adding to the outside noise, Tagovailoa also acknowledged that he didn't protect the locker room by airing the team's business publicly. \"I felt like I let the emotions of the game get to me after the game,\" he said. \"That's something that I can learn from as a leader on this team. What happens in-house should be protected, and none of that should have gotten out. And so want to publicly apologize about that. Want to move forward and focus on the Cleveland Browns.\" \nAs Tagovailoa surely knows, winning can cure a lot of things for a struggling team. Fortunately for the Dolphins, their next opponent has also won just one game and has had a similarly tumultuous start to the 2025 season. \n            \n    ",

Players expressed their concerns over poor field conditions, as the grass field was said to be \"dry\" and multiple players reported kicking up chunks of the field upon making explosive movements.The field conditions wound up having a visible impact on Sunday's game, as Steelers kicker Chris Boswell missed a field goal attempt in the fourth quarter after slipping on the turf. The Steelers also lost special teams ace Miles Killebrew to a significant non-contact knee injury, which he suffered as he planted on the turf. Steelers coach Mike Tomlin had acknowledged concerns over the playing field, saying Monday that he believed the conditions were \"poor\" but noting that the field was to be swapped out following the game.

However, an NFLPA spokesperson noted to ESPN that \"all grass surfaces aren't equal,\" as illustrated by the conditions at Acrisure Stadium on Sunday.\n\"The conditions at Acrisure Stadium underscore why players have pushed  for high-quality grass fields, and why the NFLPA continues to push for  improved, shared maintenance practices of grass fields across the  league,\" the source noted. \"... The NFLPA is advocating to establish better leaguewide standards and  pushing the NFL for more surface-specific data in order to ensure that  our members are playing on the best possible field surfaces, no matter  if it's grass or turf.\"Amid the outcry over Acrisure's playing surface, NFL spokesperson Brian McCarthy said Wednesday that the league \"has been in touch with both the union and the club, which has taken steps to replace the grass surface.\"\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Another week, another full slate of NFL action nearly in the books. And Week 8 has been chock-full of drama.Saquon Barkley finally rediscovered his big-play touch against -- who else? -- the New York Giants. The Cincinnati Bengals, who upset the Pittsburgh Steelers with a prime-time shootout back in Week 7, found themselves on the wrong end of a similarly high-scoring affair. The Drake Maye-led New England Patriots stayed hot to win their sixth game in eight weeks. And the Buffalo Bills got back on track with a major victory over the Carolina Panthers, who were without Bryce Young under center.Other surprises on Sunday: C.J. Stroud and the Houston Texans enjoyed a splashy win over the San Francisco 49ers despite battling a slew of their own injuries, the Baltimore Ravens avoided a slide to 1-6 while awaiting Lamar Jackson's return, and the Atlanta Falcons stood no chance against the Miami Dolphins, even with Kirk Cousins getting a shot to lead the team off the bench.Which players, coaches and teams stood out as the biggest winners (or losers) of Week 8? Here goes:\nWinner: Jordan LoveOn the night his former mentor got to play host to an anticipated \"Sunday Night Football\" matchup, Love had a much more comfortable experience, launching the ball to the tune of 360 yards and three scores. He also got Grade-A help from tight end Tucker Kraft, who galloped all over the Pittsburgh Steelers defense to help spoil Aaron Rodgers' prime-time appearance.Loser: Mike TomlinThe Steelers coach got a solid and composed outing from Rodgers against the Packers, even taking a 16-7 lead into halftime of Sunday night's clash with Green Bay. What did he expect, Rodgers to also play defense? Tomlin's unit of specialty had no answers as the game wore on, leaving A-Rod to scratch and claw for hope in a two-score defeat, and dropping Pittsburgh to 4-3 on the year.Winner: Jonathan Taylor's MVP caseA year after Barkley cruised past the 2,000-yard mark, the Indianapolis Colts star is on pace for an almost equally dynamic season as the centerpiece of Shane Steichen's suddenly imposing attack. The veteran running back was averaging close to 17 yards per carry (!) just over halfway through a rout of the Tennessee Titans, and he's been money all year as Daniel Jones' offensive sidekick.\nLoser: Spencer RattlerThis isn't solely, or even primarily, because the young quarterback was unplayable as the New Orleans Saints' starter, but rather that he was basically set up to fail as the trial-run passer for Kellen Moore's rebuild. Speaking of Moore, he finally made the switch to rookie Tyler Shough against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, essentially turning the page on Rattler's scrappy, if unspectacular, run.\nWinner: Sean PaytonWhat a week for the Denver Broncos coach. Days after deflecting a rare Russell Wilson outburst, Payton didn't just stick it to the Dallas Cowboys, who apparently courted Payton multiple times over the course of his esteemed career; he outright embarrassed them, leading Bo Nix and Co. to a one-sided victory over a superior roster even with top defender Patrick Surtain II banged up.Loser: Dak PrescottThe Cowboys quarterback was understandably drawing MVP buzz coming into Week 8, consistently feeding CeeDee Lamb and/or George Pickens to help offset Dallas' porous defense. Then he ran into the Broncos defense, which made him look downright silly with two picks in a 44-24 blowout. The 'Boys wouldn't be near .500 without Dak, but this was an ugly day of decisions for the vet.\nWinner: Tyler HuntleyThe Baltimore Ravens got into trouble by improperly indicating Jackson might return from his hamstring injury against the Chicago Bears. But Huntley, who's now on his third stint with the club, stepped up in the former MVP's absence, completing his first nine throws and also scurrying for 50+ yards on the ground to help the Ravens snap a four-game slide and rout the Chicago Bears.Loser: Raheem MorrisA few weeks ago, Morris' Atlanta Falcons looked as if they might be on the verge of sneaking into the NFC South mix, showcasing a feisty defense in an upset of the Buffalo Bills. That \"D\" was nowhere to be found against the lowly Miami Dolphins, who rediscovered their aerial efficiency in a blowout win. Not even Bijan Robinson could save Atlanta's injury- and penalty-plagued offense, either.\n        \n            \n                The tush push didn't die in a meeting room; it died on a Sunday in Philadelphia\n                \n                    Jonathan Jones                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWinner: Jonathan Taylor's fellow big-money RBsStruggling to find green grass for much of 2025, reigning Offensive Player of the Year Barkley finally hit a home run against his old team, the New York Giants, as part of the Philadelphia Eagles' best rushing effort of the year. Meanwhile, James Cook, who just got a new deal with the Bills, exploded for 216 yards against the Carolina Panthers, and Baltimore's Derrick Henry scored twice.\nLoser: Everyone involved with the Bengals defenseZac Taylor runs the staff. Al Golden runs the defense. Higher-ups direct the roster. All of them must answer for the trainwreck that is Cincinnati's \"defense,\" which cost Joe Burrow a playoff run in 2024 and is about to make the team irrelevant again. Despite another valiant connection between Joe Flacco and Ja'Marr Chase, Cincy dropped to 3-5 by giving up 39 points to the New York Jets.Winner: Mike McDaniel's job securityFor another couple of weeks, at least. Tua Tagovailoa may or may not have the big-game fortitude necessary to keep the current Dolphins regime intact for the long haul. But the maligned quarterback finally found a rhythm under Mike McDaniel's direction against the Falcons to the tune of four scores and zero turnovers. Miami is still just 2-6, but this will quiet the wolves for a little bit longer.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Sports fans rejoice! The 2025 Sports Equinox -- in which MLB, NBA, NFL and NHL action overlap for single day -- arrives Monday, the lone day on the calendar in which all four major North American professional sports leagues are in action.How is it possible? Well, we're at the very end of the MLB postseason, the very beginning of the NBA and NHL seasons and in the middle of the NFL season. According to Sports Reference, this is just the 32nd Sports Equinox ever, and the first since Oct. 28, 2024. In fact, we've had at least one a year since 2015, and three in September of 2020 due to the impact COVID-19 had on the revision of sports schedules.2025 will mark the third straight year the Sports Equinox has fallen on a Monday, and it will be only the fifth time such an event has fallen on a Monday. The only other days of the week these have ever fallen on have been Thursdays, with seven, and Sundays, with 20, including the first one back on Oct. 17, 1971.2025 Sports Equinox scheduleAll times EasternMLB: Dodgers vs. Blue Jays -- World Series Game 3, 8 p.m. on FoxNFL: Commanders at Chiefs, 8:15 p.m. on ABC/ESPNNHL:Blues at Penguins, 7 p.m. on NHL NetworkBruins at Senators, 7:30 p.m. on ESPN+NBA:Cavaliers at Pistons, 7 p.m. on PeacockMagic at 76ers, 7 p.m. on NBA League PassHawks at Bulls, 8 p.m. on NBA League PassNets at Rockets, 8 p.m. on NBA League PassCeltics at Pelicans, 8 p.m. on NBA League PassRaptors at Spurs, 8 p.m. on NBA League PassThunder at Mavericks, 8:30 p.m. on NBA League PassSuns at Jazz, 9 p.m. on NBA League PassNuggets at Timberwolves, 9:30 p.m. on PeacockGrizzlies at Warriors, 10 p.m. on NBA League PassTrail Blazers at Lakers, 10:30 p.m. on NBA League PassHow to plan out your sports-watching eveningYes, it's a lot of sports. But we'd take that over not a lot of sports every day of the week. As such, here's how you can make sure to catch the best of everything Monday has to offer. Just make sure you have multiple screens!\n7 p.m. hourBefore the night gets super duper busy, we suggest you get some NHL action on your screen. The Penguins are off to a hot start this season behind their iconic Sidney Crosby-Evgeni Malkin duo. Malkin, 39, has two goals and is leading the league with 12 assists through nine games this season, while Crosby, 38, has six goals and five assists. Pittsburgh, which has not made the playoffs since 2022, is 6-2-1.Also be sure to throw on some NBA action. Pistons-Cavaliers on Peacock catches our eye, but don't sleep on 76ers-Magic, either. All four of those teams expect to contend in a wide-open Eastern Conference.8 p.m. hourOK, now things are getting hectic, but you won't want to be even a moment late for World Series Game 3 between the Dodgers and the Blue Jays in Los Angeles. Why? Well, you may have heard of this guy named Shohei Ohtani, the leadoff hitter for Los Angeles. His plate appearances are must-see stuff.\nIf you're a baseball fan, you're probably leaving that game on and not focusing much anywhere else. It's the World Series, after all.If you're looking for a new secondary option, Chiefs vs. Commanders is a solid choice. There's no Jayden Daniels for Washington, but Patrick Mahomes is starting to get things really rolling for Kansas City. The Chiefs are coming off a 31-0 win over the Raiders, and Rashee Rice scored two touchdowns in his season debut. Marcus Mariota gets the call in place of Daniels for Washington, and he has played well in both of his starts this season.Should you have access to it, we also recommend Spurs-Raptors. Victor Wembanyama is hilariously fun to watch, and if you need proof, just watch the highlights of his 40-point season opener. Seriously, he looks like a cheat code.\n9 p.m. hourLet's keep that baseball and football on, assuming they're good games. If you're not feeling one of those and have the capability, hop back to one of those early NBA games, which will be coming down to crunch time.Once those finish up, be sure to tune into Timberwolves-Nuggets. These two teams have some tremendous recent history: In 2023, the Nuggets beat the Timberwolves in five games in the first round of the playoffs, but last year the Timberwolves pulled off a second-round, seven-game stunner over the reigning champs. Nikola Jokić vs. Anthony Edwards. What more could you want?Late nightAfter MLB and much of the NBA slate wraps up, Chiefs-Commanders will be well into the second half, but there's plenty of NBA star power to cap your night, too. Stephen Curry's Warriors host Ja Morant's Girzzlies, and Luka Dončić, Austin Reaves and the Lakers face the Trail Blazers to finish off a busy night.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Leave it to NFL teams to eventually reveal the truth about themselves. The truth always comes out at some point in the season, and Week 8 certainly is justifying some theories. The Cincinnati Bengals are the prime example. Leave it to the Bengals to give the New York Jets their first win of the season, a game Cincinnati had on lock midway through the fourth quarter. The Atlanta Falcons continue to show they can't be trusted after getting blown out by the Miami Dolphins. The New York Giants are still the Giants, even with their future a lot better with Jaxson Dart. Some teams are still giving a glimmer of hope they can make the playoffs, while others are starting to see those dreams slip away. This is the beauty of the NFL every week, and the fun of overreactions. The stories sometimes write themselves.Which overreactions in the Week 8 Sunday slate are farfetched and which are reality?\n\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 8 grades: Cowboys get 'F' for blowout loss to Broncos; Packers earn 'A-' for win over Steelers\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Eagles offense is better off without A.J. BrownOverreaction or reality: OverreactionThe Eagles have been trying to figure out their offense all season, and got going in a big way. In a blowout win over the Giants, the Eagles put up 427 yards or offense, averaged 7.5 yards per play, and scored 38 points. Jalen Hurts threw four touchdown passes and Saquon Barkley finished with 150 rushing yards. The Eagles as a team rushed for 276 yards and averaged 8.4 yards per carry. This was their best offensive performance of the season, and A.J. Brown didn't play because of a hamstring injury. Brown being unhappy with the Eagles and how he's used in the offense is another discussion (and a mystery), but is this offense really better without Brown? Of course not, even with Hurts going 15 of 20 for 179 yards and four touchdowns and Barkley averaging 10.7 yards per carry. This team needs Brown, one of the top receivers in the league, to be a part of this offense. Brown can stretch the field and keep a defense honest, opening up the run game for Barkley and giving Jalen Hurts a downfield threat. \nNo matter what Brown's issues are with Hurts and the Eagles, they need their All-Pro receiver to win another Super Bowl. Period. Dak Prescott is not a big game quarterback Overreaction or reality: RealityThe Cowboys defense is atrocious and is the biggest culprit why they are 3-4-1 through eight games. Dallas didn't have a chance to beat Denver with the way the defense played, a unit that's looking like a square peg in a round hole.You know who else didn't show up either? Dak Prescott. This was a game for Prescott to change the narrative. He was facing a top five pass defense with elite cornerbacks, in the midst of an MVP-caliber season. Heading into Sunday, Prescott ranked fourth in the league in completion percentage (71.4%), second in passing yards (1,881), second in passing touchdowns (16) and eighth in passer rating (107.6). \nHe put up a clunker against Denver, finishing 19 of 31 for 188 yards and two interceptions for a 51.5 passer rating. He went 4 of 7 for 81 yards and an interception (58.3 rating) on throws of 10+ air yards. The Cowboys didn't move the ball consistently, looking like a shell of the offense that dominated opponents all year. No matter how bad the defense is, Prescott makes $60 million a year. The weight is on his shoulders -- fair or not -- to carry this offense and keep Dallas in the game. He failed to do that and the offense laid an egg against an elite defense. This is who Prescott is in Year 10 of his career. Good quarterback, but comes up small. There's still time to change the narrative, but Sunday brought back those thoughts regarding how to define Prescott's career. \nPackers have not proven they are an elite teamOverreaction or reality: OverreactionThere will be a big deal made regarding the Packers' win over the Steelers, but Pittsburgh isn't a good team. The entire AFC North isn't good, as the Packers have gotten the benefit of playing three of those teams already. Does that mean Green Bay isn't an elite team? Of course not.The Packers are one of the best teams in football, but it's fair to question the team with the NFC's best record. Their strength of victory (.472) is inflated by a Week 1 win over Detroit, and Green Bay did lose to Cleveland and tied Dallas. The Packers still have a good quarterback with a very deep wide receiver group that just got reinforcements in Christian Watson, and a premier running back and offensive line. Need we say more about what Micah Parsons has done for this defense? The Packers are one of the five best teams in the NFL, so they are elite. Are they the best? Green Bay will have to beat Philadelphia and Detroit in November. \nThe AFC North will have a 9-win championOverreaction or reality: RealityWatching the Packers clobber the Steelers in the second half makes you realize how bad the AFC North is. The Steelers have lost two in a row and still lead the division by two games in the loss column. The Bengals lost to the Jets (handing New York its first win) and the Browns are a rebuilding team that was beaten up by the Patriots. Cincinnati likely played its way out of the division and Cleveland is in the hunt for the top draft pick. We don't know what the Ravens are because Lamar Jackson isn't back yet, but the only reason Baltimore is in the division race is because Pittsburgh can't run away with the title. Pittsburgh doesn't beat good teams, so a double-digit win season seems farfetched at this stage. The Steelers have the Colts and Chargers in back-to-back weeks, and also play the Bills and Lions. There's a really good chance Pittsburgh won't win 10 games this year. \nThe AFC North will have a 9-win champion -- at most. Bengals playoff hopes are dead and buriedOverreaction or reality: RealityLeave it to the Bengals to take away all their momentum after their biggest win of the season last week. Cincinnati was 3-4 and right in the thick of the AFC North race prior to facing the winless New York Jets Sunday, a golden opportunity to go 4-4. Instead, the Bengals lost to the Jets. New York was down 38-24 with nine minutes left and rallied to beat Cincinnati, 39-38, a display of what the Bengals truly are through eight games -- a team with a bad defense and their All-Pro quarterback sidelined. The Bengals are 1-3 when scoring 38+ points over the last two years and have allowed 27+ points in seven straight games. No matter how well the Bengals offense is playing with Joe Flacco (29.7 points per game, 378.7 yards per game), Cincinnati isn't a playoff team with that defense on the field. Trey Hendrickson being hurt is icing on the cake. \nThis defense hasn't been playoff caliber all year, and losing to the Jets is unacceptable if a team is going to make a run at the division. Count the Bengals out of the AFC North race. Ravens are alive and well in AFC North raceOverreaction or reality: OverreactionThe truth of the matter is, regarding the Ravens -- we really don't know. Lamar Jackson was preparing to play this week, and then he was ruled out. Baltimore played without Jackson coming out of the bye week and started Tyler Huntley, who managed the game well enough to win on Sunday against Chicago. The Ravens get the Dolphins next week, and Jackson may not be playing in that contest either. Can Huntley and this defense -- which held an opponent to 17-or-less points again -- keep the ship afloat one more week before Jackson returns? \nThe Ravens are 2-5 and need some help from the Steelers to get back in the AFC North hunt (and they got some of it with the Steelers losing to the Packers). A loss Sunday would have buried Baltimore, but the Ravens stayed alive just by winning a game. If Jackson is back next week, look out for Baltimore. If the Ravens are 3-5 when Jackson comes back (assuming it's Week 10), they'll be on notice.Injuries will keep 49ers out of NFC West title huntOverreaction or reality: OverreactionThe 49ers have been bitten by the injury bug all season, and those wounds finally showed against the Texans. San Francisco finished with just 48 rushing yards and allowed 475 total yards in Sunday's loss to Houston, a defense that clearly was affected without Nick Bosa and Fred Warner (both are out for the season). \nSan Francisco's defense had just two quarterback hits in the game, finishing with zero sacks. C.J. Stroud had his way against the 49ers pressure (or lack thereof), going 7 of 8 for 63 yards and a touchdown (139.1 passer rating). This loss was all the more surprising given how the 49ers defense has played without Bosa and Warner.Are the injuries to those two -- and others -- becoming too much to overcome? Bryce Huff was also out Sunday, and the 49ers lost Jordan Elliott, Sam Okuayinonu, and Dee Winters on defense. On offense, Brock Purdy, Ricky Pearsall, Ben Bartch, Jake Brendel, and Brandon Aiyuk are out. Purdy is expected back next week, and the same can be said for Pearsall. The 49ers are banged up, but this is a team that has weathered the storm to a 5-3 record. They aren't out of the division race yet, but Sunday was a bad loss. The tush push will be banned after the seasonOverreaction or reality: RealityThe excuses for the \"Tush Push\" have been well documented and discussed. While it's embarrassing officials say they can't officiate the play, that's the reality of the situation. Officials have a very tough job already, but they miss holds, late hits, fumbles, and pass interference plays -- and all this was in the Eagles-Giants game!When the Eagles ran the tush push and the play was ruled down due to forward progress, it's understandable. Jalen Hurts was still moving and fumbled the ball in a tie game early in the second quarter. That had nothing to do with forward progress, but the officials just missing a fumble that looked abundantly clear.Again, officials miss calls constantly. This runs deeper than the tush push, but the play is a difficult one to officiate. This is why the tush push will not last past this year, because officials can't officiate the play correctly. The play is controversial because it's not anesthetically pleasing, and the league is trying to find a reason to eliminate the play.They may have their example from Eagles-Giants in Week 8. Kirk Cousins will never start a game in the NFL again Overreaction or reality: OverreactionIf Joe Flacco can start a game again, so can Cousins. Both of the older quarterbacks are in different situations regarding their NFL careers, as Cousins isn't the same player coming off a ruptured Achilles suffered two years ago. Cousins got the start on Sunday for Michael Penix Jr. and struggled, going 21 of 31 for 173 yards with no touchdown, no interceptions, and an 81.8 passer rating (the Falcons only scored 10 points and had 213 yards of offense). This was more of a Zac Robinson failure than Cousins, as the Falcons had just 15 rush attempts and Bijan Robinson had only nine carries. That's malpractice to Robinson and the Falcons offensive line, as Atlanta was still in the game midway through the second quarter. Cousins isn't teh same player that can sling the ball 30+ times the game, nor should he be asked to in a spot start. Once Cousins gets out of Atlanta and makes backup quarterback money, he'll get an opportunity to start a game again due to the injuries and nature of the position. Cousins just needs to get out of Atlanta, and the Falcons can't wait until the dead money gradually decreases on that contract. The Cousins contract was a disaster, for all parties involved. Sunday was just another rough moment. Jonathan Taylor will break the single-season rushing TD recordOverreaction or reality: OverreactionWith two rushing touchdowns on Sunday, Taylor is at 12 rushing touchdowns through eight games. The Colts running back was in the conversation to challenge LaDainian Tomlinson's record of 28, but Taylor has vaulted himself into a legitimate chance to break the mark.Taylor is on pace for 26 rushing touchdowns on the season, so he'll be two short by that pace. Taylor does have nine rushing touchdowns in his last four games and 10 total, so he's on a hot streak as the Colts offense continues to dominate opponents. The Colts offense runs through Taylor and the offensive line is getting stronger by the week.There's work to be done, but the Colts offense is a well-oiled machine right now. Taylor is the cog behind the success. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        In the Week 8 edition of \"Monday Night Football,\" the Kansas City Chiefs play host to the Washington Commanders.Kansas City is coming off a dominating win over the division-rival Raiders, which moved the Chiefs over .500 for the first time this season. They have won four of their last five games after starting out 0-2, and they have a chance here to keep pace in the AFC West race. Washington lost in blowout fashion to division-rival Dallas last week, dropping to 3-4 in the process after previously having blown a winnable game against the Bears the week before. The Commanders are once again starting backup quarterback Marcus Mariota here, after Jayden Daniels suffered an injury during the loss to the Cowboys. Will the Chiefs continue to roll, or will the Commanders bounce back? We'll find out soon enough. Before we break down the matchup, here's a look at how you can watch the game.\nBet Chiefs vs. Commanders at BetMGM Sportsbook, where new users get up to $1,500 in bonus bets back if their first wager doesn't win with the promo code CBSSPORTS.Where to watch Chiefs vs. Commanders liveDate: Monday, Oct. 27 | Time: 8:15 p.m. ETLocation: GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium (Kansas City)TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (try for free) Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Chiefs -10.5, O/U 48.5 (via DraftKings Sportsbook)When the Commanders have the ball\nAs mentioned, the Commanders are once again without Jayden Daniels for this game. Mariota made two starts in place of Daniels earlier this season and went 31 of 48 for 363 yards, three touchdowns and an interception against the Raiders and Falcons, while adding 60 yards and a touchdown on his eight carries. Mariota will benefit from having Terry McLaurin and Deebo Samuel back. McLaurin has been out since Week 4 while Samuel was playing through a heel injury and missed last week because of it. \nKansas City's defense has been stingy since a season-opening loss to the Chargers. The Chiefs have allowed fewer than 300 total yards in four of their last six games, and last week they held the Raiders to 95 (NINETY-FIVE) yards on only 30 snaps. They've faced something of a soft schedule during that stretch thanks to games against Russell Wilson, a half of Cooper Rush and then the Raiders, but they also held the Lions largely in check and didn't exactly get lit up by Lamar Jackson before his injury.\nWashington will likely try to control the game on the ground with Jacory Croskey-Merritt and Mariota, given that the run game is likely to be the strength of the offense and that doing so would help keep Patrick Mahomes off the field. The Commanders are averaging a league-best 5.3 yards per rush, with a significant portion of those being yards after contact because both their running backs and quarterbacks have been good at breaking tackles. (They have the league's 10th-highest avoided tackle rate.) The Chiefs can be run on, as they have given up 4.5 yards per carry, so the strategy of trying to pound the rock is probably a wise one.\nWhen Mariota does drop back to pass, he'll face a unit that ranks fifth-best in the league in EPA per dropback, via Tru Media, holding opponents to 6.6 yards per attempt with just seven touchdowns in seven weeks against four picks. The Chiefs have limited explosive plays through the air for the most part, and they've done an excellent job of getting off the field on third downs. Their pressure rate is among the best in the league and the coverage has largely been sticky. Even with McLaurin and Samuel back, Mariota could struggle through the air unless Kliff Kingsbury finds a way to scheme him into quick-strike throws. \n        \n            \n                In a season slipping away, Commanders are right to prioritize Jayden Daniels' health -- now and for the future\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhen the Chiefs have the ball\nKansas City's offense is on a roll right now. After a slow start to the season, the Chiefs have produced at least 355 yards, 24 first downs and 28 points in four consecutive games. The Chiefs got Rashee Rice back last week against the Raiders, and he debuted with seven catches for 42 yards and two touchdowns despite playing only 33 snaps. Kansas City will continue to ramp up his workload and continue to benefit from his presence.Patrick Mahomes is already playing at an MVP level with a 66.1% completion rate at 7.3 yards per attempt with 14 touchdowns and just two interceptions, and he's added 250 yards and four scores with his legs. Mahomes has finally gotten back to hitting for explosive plays, connecting with guys like Xavier Worthy, Tyquan Thornton and Hollywood Brown down the field while continuing to work efficiently in the underneath areas of the field, just as he has for the last several seasons. \nWashington has been one of the NFL's weakest pass defenses this season, checking in 23rd in Tru Media's EPA per dropback while allowing opponents to average 8.3 yards per attempt and throw 12 touchdown passes against two interceptions. The Commanders have given up 22 completions of 20 or more yards, per Tru Media, ranking 25th in explosive pass rate allowed. Against a Chiefs team that is throwing downfield more often than in recent seasons, that's a recipe for giving up big plays.The Commanders will have to generate a ton of pressure to cover up for the secondary, and they have actually done a good job of that so far this year, collecting a sack, hit or hurry on 40.7% of opponent dropbacks while blitzing at a rate only slightly above league average. The Chiefs will again be without left tackle Josh Simmons, but they've largely kept Mahomes well protected this year and he has done an incredible job of scrambling away from pressure whenever the protection has broken down.\nKansas City's run game hasn't been much to write home about so far this year, with Isiah Pacheco, Kareem Hunt and Brashard Smith combining to average just 3.9 yards per carry. Pacheco has recently taken more control of the backfield with Hunt taking a back seat, but Hunt has remained the third-down and short-yardage back. Smith has mostly operated as a gadget guy, with the Chiefs looking to get the ball in his hands whenever he's on the field but using him in a limited role, primarily as a pass-catcher. \nWashington's defensive front has done an OK job against the run this season, limiting opposing backs to just 1.22 yards before contact per carry, which ranks 10th in the NFL. The Commanders have been a poor tackling unit, though, ranking 29th in broken tackle rate and giving up yards after contact. Whether this group of Chiefs backs is capable of breaking tackles is an open question, but the game plan is likely to be pass-heavy and focused on Mahomes and Co. either way.Prediction\nKansas City has matchup advantages here, particularly with the way its offense has looked over the last several weeks. With the Commanders on the road and starting their backup quarterback, it's hard to do anything but take the Chiefs, even laying the points.Pick: Chiefs 31, Commanders 13\n            ",

That's the third best spread record over that stretch, while Kansas City has failed to live up to the line in recent Monday games. Patrick Mahomes is just 1-6 ATS over his last seven Monday games, after beginning his career with a 5-0-1 ATS mark in these contests.Regardless of who is under center for Washington, its offense will run through the ground game.

Byron, who earned his third win of the season, third at Martinsville and the 16th of his Cup career, overcame a 36 point deficit to the Championship 4 cut line to join Denny Hamlin, Chase Briscoe, and Hendrick Motorsports teammate Kyle Larson in next week's championship race at Phoenix.After two previous potential winning efforts in the Round of 8 went awry late in those races -- colliding with a lapped car coming to pit road at Las Vegas and spinning out of the pack coming to the finish line at Talladega -- Byron made a statement by winning the pole at Martinsville, then leading 304 of 500 laps. But in order to make the Championship 4, Byron had to run down Ryan Blaney in a run to the finish that amounted to a head-to-head fight between drivers who had to win in order to make it to Phoenix.\n        \n            \n                NASCAR playoffs 2025 race schedule, results: Complete list of Cup Series race dates, winners, tracks\n                \n                    Steven Taranto                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nByron made his move with 43 laps to go, moving Blaney off of the bottom groove in turn 1 to take the lead.

They did so, earning the right to try and become a championship team.\n\"Things have a way of working out. God really tests your resilience a lot of times, and we've been tested,\" Byron told NBC Sports. \"Unbelievable. I'm out of breath ... I am just so thankful, excited to see my family, and just celebrate this one. We obviously go to Phoenix and just try to go kick ass there.\n\"You just work so hard, all these guys work so hard, and you put everything into Sundays. And sometimes, you don't get anything in return, and that's been the last couple weeks and honestly throughout the year we've had some close calls. Sometimes life is that way. But you've just got to keep being resilient, and we were, and it just feels damn good.\"Blaney finished second, but it would be all for naught as he, Chase Elliott, Christopher Bell and defending Cup champion Joey Logano were eliminated from championship contention at the end of the Round of 8. Elliott finished third with Ross Chastain fourth, Kyle Larson fifth, Ryan Preece sixth, and then Bell, Logano, Todd Gilliland and Josh Berry rounding out the top 10.After the two were separated by just a single point entering Martinsville, Larson was able to successfully outpoint Bell, becoming the final driver to make the Championship 4 by seven points. But with Byron's win bumping the cut line down, it meant Bell had his heart ripped out for the second year in a row, having entered Martinsville with a 37-point advantage on the cut line only to be eliminated from title contention.\n\"We had good enough track position all day that we were kind of out of the mess, I guess,\" Larson told NBC Sports. \"... Happy for [William], happy for our team, happy for Hendrick Motorsports. This went as good as it could've for us, to score more points than Christopher and then have William or Chase win, too. Glad we can give Mr. H an opportunity next week, and hopefully one of us can win it.\"\"Just seemed  like we were lacking a little bit of long run pace,\" Bell told NBC Sports. \"I felt whenever we  got the balance close at times I could take off on tires and do okay and  make some passes, maintain my position. Then the consistent theme of  the day was just falling backwards as the tires got old.\"We just  weren't strong enough at Martinsville this weekend. We practiced in the  teens, we qualified in the teens, and kind of raced back there most of  the day. I feel content with the results. I think the four going there  are legitimate contenders. Whoever the champion is, it's going to be  well-deserved. The 20 team wasn't good enough.\"\nThe Championship 4 will pit the two Hendrick cars of Byron and Larson against two Joe Gibbs Racing cars driven by Denny Hamlin and Chase Briscoe, both of whom failed to finish on Sunday after suffering engine failures. Of that group, only Larson has previously won the Cup championship, having won the crown in 2021.With three rounds of playoff racing now in the books, next week's NASCAR Cup Series Championship Race at Phoenix Raceway comes down to a pure match race between the four drivers who have made the final round. Whoever among the Championship 4 drivers has the best finish in the Championship Race will become the 2025 NASCAR Cup Series champion.\nXfinity 500 results#24 - William Byron#12 - Ryan Blaney#9 - Chase Elliott#1 - Ross Chastain#5 - Kyle Larson#60 - Ryan Preece#20 - Christopher Bell#22 - Joey Logano#34 - Todd Gilliland#21 - Josh Berry#45 - Tyler Reddick#54 - Ty Gibbs#8 - Kyle Busch#88 - Shane van Gisbergen (R)#2 - Austin Cindric#3 - Austin Dillon#41 - Cole Custer#23 - Bubba Wallace#7 - Justin Haley#6 - Brad Keselowski#42 - John Hunter Nemechek#99 - Daniel Suarez#48 - Alex Bowman#71 - Michael McDowell#38 - Zane Smith#10 - Ty Dillon#47 - Ricky Stenhouse Jr.#16 - A.J.

Prior to that, Albernaz was major league field coordinator for the Guardians. In earlier years, Albernaz was bullpen coach for the San Francisco Giants and also coached and managed at various levels within the Tampa Bay Rays farm system. As a player, the Massachusetts native spent parts of nine seasons in the minors as a catcher within the Rays and Detroit Tigers organizations. He reached as high as Triple-A. Albernaz inherits an Orioles team that still has a strong core of position players all in their twenties. However, the Orioles despite lots of talent finished a disappointing 75-87 this season and placed last in the American League East. Coming off consecutive postseason berths in 2023 and 2024, expectations were much higher. Those expectations cost manager Brandon Hyde his job in the middle of May. Interim replacement Tony Masolino managed a winning record over the remainder of the season (60-59), but ultimately lead decision-maker Mike Elias decided to go in another direction for dugout leadership. As such, the 2026 season brings with it a certain degree of pressure on both Elias and Albernaz to get the Orioles back into contending mode and win a playoff series for the first time in more than a decade. Elias' lack of aggressiveness in trading prospects for near-term roster needs and the lack of payroll investment from ownership remain impediments. \nNow that the Orioles are poised to name Albernaz to their post, the list of teams in need of managers for 2026 is down to five: the San Diego Padres, Atlanta Braves, Colorado Rockies, Washington Nationals, and Minnesota Twins. \n            \n    ",

He is yet to allow a touchdown this season as the primary defender, and entering Week 8, he had allowed just a 48.5% completion rate, seventh-best among 76 players who had been the primary defender on at least 30 passes.\nSurtain missed just two games in his first four seasons in the NFL. With him missing time, Riley Moss and first-round rookie Jahdae Barron would be more under the spotlight; Barron had an interception on the Cowboys' final offensive play of the first half.\n            \n    ",

Elliott was ruled out for the remainder of the game with a knee injury. Per the NBC broadcast, Elliott was yelling and appeared to be in considerable pain as he exited the field and into the Steelers' locker room. \nThe 28-year-old Elliott is a major component of Pittsburgh's defense. A seven-year veteran, Elliott played so well last year -- his first with the Steelers -- that Pittsburgh inked him to a contract extension this past offseason. Last year, Elliott set career-highs with 108 tackles and three fumble recoveries while helping Pittsburgh clinch a playoff berth. \nThis year, Elliott has had an even bigger impact on Pittsburgh's secondary given the trade of fellow safety Minkah Fitzpatrick to Miami in exchange for fellow defensive back Jalen Ramsey and tight end Jonnu Smith. He missed two games earlier this year due to injury but had 21 tackles in Pittsburgh's last two games. Along with his productivity, Elliott is also Pittsburgh's chief communicator on the backend of the defense. That was surely one of the main reasons why the Steelers prioritized Elliott's contract extension this past offseason. \nElliott's absence would be critical to a Steelers' defense that has been inconsistent during the first half of the 2025 season. With that in mind, don't be surprised if Pittsburgh GM Omar Khan makes some calls prior to the Nov. 4 trade deadline as it relates to possibly adding reinforcements in the secondary. \n            \n    ",

He's top five in passing yards and passing touchdowns. He won a Super Bowl and a Super Bowl MVP. But in Sunday night's 35-25 loss to the Packers, he missed out on adding one more accolade. With a win, he would have been just the fifth quarterback to defeat all 32 current NFL franchises.Considering the Packers and the Steelers are in different conferences -- and more crucially that Rodgers is 41 years old and has said that this will be his final season -- it will likely remain that way.\nThis was Rodgers' first game against his former longtime franchise. He played and beat his other former franchise, the Jets, in Week 1. Though Rodgers didn't play poorly Sunday (219 passing yards, two touchdowns, no interceptions), Pittsburgh's offense managed just one touchdown in the second half, and the defense fell off significantly against Jordan Love (360 passing yards, three touchdowns) after a strong start.Though we'll never say never with Rodgers, it appears the four-quarterback group to beat all 32 teams -- Brett Favre, Tom Brady, Drew Brees and Peyton Manning -- is safe for now. It should also be noted that Fran Tarkenton and Joe Montana beat all 28 teams when the league only had 28 teams.\nRodgers remains on the slightly less-impressive (but still very impressive) list of quarterbacks to beat 31 teams.Quarterbacks to defeat 31 NFL   teamsTeam not defeatedAlex SmithKansas   City ChiefsBen RoethlisbergerPittsburgh   SteelersPatrick MahomesKansas   City ChiefsAaron RodgersGreen   Bay PackersRussell WilsonSeattle   SeahawksMatthew StaffordPittsburgh   SteelersKerry CollinsMiami   Dolphins\n            \n    ",

At least nine teams will be changing full-time skippers heading into 2026, including the San Diego Padres, San Francisco Giants, Atlanta Braves and Baltimore Orioles.The Baltimore Orioles, coming off 75-87 season that saw them finish in the basement of the AL East, are reportedly hiring Guardians associate manager Craig Albernaz. Brandon Hyde was fired in May and interim manager Tony Mansolino was not handed the full-time reins.The Los Angeles Angels, who let go of both Ron Washington and interim Ray Montgomery, have hired former player Kurt Suzuki as their new skipper. Suzuki spent parts of 16 years in the majors, including his last two with the Angels, and won a World Series ring with the Washington Nationals in 2019.The San Francisco Giants, meanwhile, went out of the box and hired Tennessee coach Tony Vitello to take over for Bob Melvin, who was fired after their season ended. Vitello, who went 341-131 in eight years as head coach at Tennessee, is the first collegiate coach to jump straight to an MLB manager job. He also never played professional baseball.\nThe Texas Rangers became Major League Baseball's first team to complete a managerial change earlier in the month, officially announcing that Skip Schumaker will take over in the dugout. Texas had previously announced a parting of ways with Bruce Bochy, the future Hall of Fame skipper who guided the franchise to its first (and to date only) World Series title in 2023.While there is going to be an unusually large amount of turnover, you shouldn't fret.

    "body": "\n        While the pregame hype was centered around Aaron Rodgers, Jordan Love stole the show on Sunday night while leading the Packers to a 35-25 win over the Steelers and his former teammate. In a twist of irony, Love's brilliant night included him tying a franchise record with Brett Favre, the Packers' Hall of Fame quarterback whom Rodgers succeeded as Green Bay's QB1 in 2008. During the game, Love tied Favre's 18-year-old franchise record by completing 20 consecutive passes. Ironically, Rodgers was Favre's teammate when Favre completed 20 straight passes during the 2007 season. \"It's definitely special,\" Love told NBC Sports afterward. \"Obviously, I think we faced a little adversity in the first half and bounced back. We knew it was gonna be a hyped-up game all week going against A-Rod. Glad we came in here handled business.\" Love's hot streak helped the Packers turn a 16-7 halftime deficit into a 35-19 lead with just under four minutes to play. He had a lot of success throwing to tight end Tucker Kraft, who caught seven passes for 143 yards and two touchdowns on National Tight Ends Day.\n\"We knew we just had to focus on the details,\" Love said of Green Bay's halftime adjustments. \"Everybody's got to go out there, do their job and just lock in and go out there and make the plays we weren't making in the first half. And we did.\" They certainly did. And while it was a complete team effort, the Packers' dominant second-half performance was keyed by Love, who finished the game with 360 yards on 29 of 37 passing while becoming the first Packers quarterback since Hall of Famer Bart Starr to get a win in Pittsburgh. \nLike Rodgers and Favre, Love spent three years as Rodgers' teammate before getting a chance to lead the Packers' offense. But unlike Rodgers, Love led the Packers to the playoffs during his first season as the team's QB1 that included a stunning upset win over Dallas in the NFC wild-card round. \nLove and the Packers were unable to duplicate that level of success in 2024, however. While they made the playoffs, the Packers were quickly dismissed by the eventual champion Eagles in the first round. Love specifically took a step back that was largely the byproduct of injuries that started during Green Bay's season-opening loss to the Eagles. The 2024 season was also a rough one for Rodgers, who signed with Pittsburgh this offsason after a tumultuous two seasons with the Jets. Rodgers has found new life in Pittsburgh as he looks to cap off his future Hall of Fame career on a positive note. Love is looking to join Rodgers, Favre and Starr as Packers quarterbacks that won a championship during their age 27 season. While he's still a ways a way from doing that, Love helped that cause on Sunday night as the 5-1-1 Packers maintained their spot atop the NFC North. \nIn the process, Love tied Favre in the history books while denying Rodgers the distinction of becoming the fifth quarterback in history to defeat all 32 teams. \n            ",

On a third-and-goal, Garrett got to Patriots quarterback Drake Maye for the sack. It was sack No. 108.5 for Garrett, moving him past NFL legend Reggie White for the most sacks before turning 30.It was the first of what ended up being a franchise-record five sacks for Garrett. He became the first player to lose a game with five sacks since Derrick Thomas in 1990, and the first ever to lose a game by more than four points while recording five sacks in a game. \nTrue to form, a frustrated Garrett told reporters after the game that he would throw away his whole individual performance for a win. Garrett already passed 2025 Hall of Fame inductee Jared Allen this season who was previously second on the under-30 list with 105 sacks. Passing White's 108 was is an impressive feat for Garrett, who doesn't turn 30 until Dec. 29 so he'll have eight more games after Sunday's game to extend his record. Garrett is already up to 10 sacks on the season. It's the eighth season in a row Garrett has reached double-digit sacks, which is tied for the second-longest streak all time. \nWhat will become interesting to watch now, is seeing how high Garrett can climb on the all-time sacks list. He entered Sunday 46th all-time, but he's likely to make a significant push and challenge the elites in the category in the coming seasons. White finished his Hall of Fame career with 198 sacks over 15 seasons. If Garrett has the longevity White had, and remains the dominant force he has been he'll have a chance to supplant him and possibly even be the first player to ever record more than 200 sacks.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        LeBron James was pretty bummed when Luka Dončić missed a free-throw with 3:05 remaining in Friday's win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. It meant that Dončić's second free throw would only take him to 49 points, and with the game in hand, he was removed before he could score his 50th. That 50-point marker is rare and special in the NBA. It only happened 18 times last season, and is worth celebrating. When Dončić came up short, the Lakers probably envisioned a pretty long wait before their next chance.That wait lasted all of two days.With Dončić sidelined due to injury along with almost 60% of the total Laker payroll against the Sacramento Kings on Sunday, Austin Reaves exploded for the best game of his career: 51 points, 11 rebounds, nine assists and a badly-needed 127-120 victory with Dončić set to miss at least a week.\n        \n            \n                Luka Dončić injury: Lakers superstar to miss at least a week with left finger sprain, leg contusion\n                \n                    Jasmyn Wimbish                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLast season, only one team, the Denver Nuggets, had multiple players reach 50 points in a game. The Lakers are a single free-throw away from getting there in their first three games. Oh, and in their season opener, Dončić scored 43. That means the Lakers own the three highest-scoring regulation games by individual players so far in the 2025-26 season. These aren't exactly outlier performances, either. Reaves scored 26 points in the opener and 25 against Minnesota while taking a backseat to Dončić. He averaged just under 23 points per game from February onward last season, and his growth as a professional has been somewhat linear. In four NBA seasons, he's gone from 7.3 to 13 to 15.9 to 20.2 points per game.\nHis assist numbers have ballooned in similar fashion. He has 29 through three games. We're dealing with a tiny sample for the 2025-26 season, of course, and it's obviously been skewed by all of the injuries the Lakers have dealt with. But this is a pretty logical progression based on how Reaves has developed throughout his entire career. He looks ready to compete for an All-Star selection. Dončić is an MVP candidate whose credentials speak for themselves. It's not an exaggeration to suggest that the Lakers could have the NBA's best offensive backcourt.So, that's what they've gotten out of the players who have been healthy. Now we have to address the player who hasn't.The expectation for James' season debut is mid-November as he recovers from sciatica. Historically speaking, though, he likes to hit the ground running. When he returned from his longest absence last season, seven games in March, he played 31 minutes and took 16 shots in his return. When he's back, he'll be back. There probably isn't going to be an easing-in period for the Lakers to tinker with. They're probably going to have to figure out his role in advance.\nAnd that's where things start to get a bit complicated. James has the sixth-highest career usage rate in NBA history. He's led his team in 19 of his 22 NBA seasons, and when he hasn't, he's deferred to Hall of Famers: 2011 Dwyane Wade, 2017 Kyrie Irving, and Dončić last season. That has historically been the proper course of action. If you have LeBron James on your team, why on Earth would you give the ball to anyone else?Well, this Laker team offers the first set of compelling reasons to do so. For one thing, he'll be 41 in December. How many quadragenarians not named LeBron James have you ever seen occupy a significant possession-share within a successful NBA offense? Skinny Luka looks downright unstoppable. Reaves isn't far behind. That was a reasonable expectation coming into the season, because the value they provide is almost exclusively offensive.That isn't the case for James. LeBron is so good with the ball in his hands that we often neglect how great he is at everything else. If he wanted to be a supercharged version of Draymond Green, he'd have no trouble doing so. He's an elite screener and passer, and when he wants to be a killer defender, he's more than capable of doing so -- at least for short stretches. Those are traits the Lakers need far more than on-ball offense. Dončić and Reaves seemingly have that specific area under control.\nThe optimal version of this Laker team, therefore, is one in which James takes a bit of a backseat offensively. He's still LeBron James. He'll still score 18-20 points per night because, well, good luck preventing him from doing so. But more of those points will probably come in transition and off of spot-ups than more direct pick-and-roll creation. James himself has even acknowledged this to an extent.\"I spent a lot of time on my catch-and-shoot 3-pointers,\" James said at media day. \" ... Understanding how can I make the most of when I don't have the ball, either moving into space. Obviously, Luka and AR [Austin Reaves] going to do a lot of time handling the ball. …We have a lot of guys that can handle the ball, so how can I still be effective on a team where I don't have to handle the ball as much?\"JJ Redick has been talking about this since before even the Dončić trade.\"LeBron is one of the smartest players and I think using him as a screener and finding ways to get him the ball in specific spots on the floor where he can be a facilitator and scorer, that's what I mean by being off the ball,\" he explained on the Lowe Post podcast in September of 2024.\nThe groundwork has been laid for this transition for some time. James hardly ever took catch-and-shoot 3s in Miami or Cleveland, but his volume ticked up pretty meaningfully after he signed with the Lakers. It peaked in 2022 and 2023, when he needed to do so to accommodate Russell Westbrook and took as many as 3.5 of them per game. That number has dipped a bit in the ensuing seasons, but the 2.9 he took per game last season still represented a meaningful jump over any of his pre-Laker seasons during the tracking era. Considering he made 42% of them a year ago, it's an adjustment he's equipped to make if he's really prepared to embrace it.But that's the question here. LeBron James has been LeBron James for so long that truly adjusting to playing a different sort of basketball is going to be tricky. When Darvin Ham tried to limit his minutes to preserve his body during the 2023-24 season, James played only 29 minutes on opening night. That's as long as that effort lasted, as he immediately played 35 two nights later and averaged 35.3 for the season as a whole. James can play any conceivable role or style.. Getting him to embrace change has always been more of a struggle. That's understandable when you're arguably the greatest player who's ever lived, but it's going to be one of the keys to this Laker season. When James opted into his contract this offseason, he made it clear that he wants to compete for championships in the twilight of his career. The best hope the Lakers have of doing so is trusting Dončić and Reaves to handle the offense while James takes care of the things they can't.\nThey're soaring to even greater offensive heights than the team hoped. But they're never going to be high-level defenders, and most of their offensive value has to come with the ball in their hands. They're limited. James isn't. He can do practically anything, even if he can't do it as often or as aggressively as he did in his youth. So as his younger teammates ascend, the key to his season will be getting comfortable with the idea of doing the things they can't.\n            ",

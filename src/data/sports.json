    "body": "\n        After an abbreviated stop in Hawaii, the 2026 PGA Tour schedule begins the West Coast Swing with The American Express 2026 beginning on Thursday at the Pete Dye Stadium Course in La Quinta, Calif. After skipping the one-week Hawaii Swing, World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler is set to make his debut as part of The American Express 2026 field. The four-time major winner hasn't played particularly well in this event, however, recording just one top-10 finish in five tries. Still, the 2026 American Express odds list Scheffler as the clear-cut +300 favorite (risk $100 to win $300). Ben Griffin, ranked No. 8 in the world, is next on the PGA odds board at +2000, with Robert MacIntyre and Russell Henley at +2200 and Ludvig Aberg at +2500. Before locking in any 2026 American Express picks, or making any PGA DFS picks on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up over $8,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.This same model has also nailed a whopping 16 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- as well as this year's PGA Championship and Open Championship. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting sites. \nNew users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Now that the 2026 American Express field is locked in, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard. 2026 American Express predictions One major surprise the model is calling for at The American Express 2026: Sam Burns, who is +2700, stumbles and barely cracks the top 10. He's a golfer to avoid at La Quinta this week. Burns had some highlights in 2025, including finishing T7 at the Tour Championship after a strong playoff run. There were also some low points as well like going nine straight tournaments without a top-20 finish, including three straight missed cuts in that run. He has a pair of top-10 finishes at The American Express, but no top-5s, and he finished T29 last year, so the model doesn't like him as a top contender this week. See who else to fade here. \nAnother surprise: The model calls Matt Fitzpatrick a top-four contender this week despite being a +3500 longshot. He's a golfer to target if you're looking for a big return. This will be his debut at The American Express, but he finished 2025 strong with four top-10 finishes in his last six events. He finished the season 34th in Strokes Gained: Total and 30th in Strokes Gained: Putting, making him a golfer to target with slightly longer odds this week. See who else to pick here. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:How to make 2026 American Express picksThe model is also targeting three other golfers with odds of +2700 or higher as top-10 contenders. You can only see the model's picks here. \nWho will win the 2026 American Express, and which longshots will stun the golfing world?

Security asked Addison to leave the premises several times, and he did not comply, according to the police report. Seminole County police were dispatched at 3:42 a.m. ET, and Addison, who \"repeatedly had to be redirected towards the front exit\" was arrested four minutes later. He was booked at 7:33 a.m. and was released from custody at 2:40 p.m. after posting bail ($500 cash bond).Florida state attorney Susan Lopez dismissed the charge Tuesday and directed the sheriff's office to release the $500 bond\"We are thrilled we were able to bring the truth to light quickly,\" Addison's attorney, Brian Pakett, said in a statement. \"This poor young man's name was being dragged through the mud over frivolous allegations and absolutely zero smoke or fire. He did nothing legally wrong, and, thankfully, the state was diligent in realizing this as soon as they did.\"\nAddison's agent, Tim Younger, said last week he was considering filing a civil lawsuit for false arrest, according to ESPN.Police arrested Addison, 23, on suspicion of DUI in July 2024 after falling asleep at the wheel of his vehicle near Los Angeles International Airport. He pleaded guilty to a \"wet reckless\" offense and received two misdemeanor charges. The NFL suspended him the first three games of the 2025 season.In July 2023, Addison received a citation for speeding and reckless driving after Minnesota State Patrol pulled him over for driving 140 miles per hour in a 55-mph zone days before training camp opened.\nAddison, a first-round pick in the 2023 NFL Draft, caught 42 passes for 610 yards and three touchdowns -- all career lows -- this season.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Tuesday NBA schedule features seven contests, and most of them have slim spreads so it's highly competitive slate. Six of the seven games have a line of under 5 points, per the latest NBA odds. Amongst the anticipated matchups are 76ers vs. Suns (+1.5), Rockets vs. Spurs (+4.5) and Lakers vs. Nuggets (+2.5). Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Clippers are riding a league-high six-game win streak but are 3.5-point underdogs to utilize in NBA bets as they visit the Chicago Bulls.Kawhi Leonard (knee) not being available plays a big role in that spread, and his absence makes Chicago an intriguing option to back in a Tuesday NBA parlay. The Bulls could get back Josh Giddey (questionable, hamstring) after missing the last three weeks, so NBA player props for the Aussie also deserve consideration with your NBA predictions.

These teams are trending in opposite directions against the spread, with Minnesota going 6-3 ATS over its nine, while Utah has failed to cover in two of its last three and is 2-10 outright over its last dozen contests. The Jazz are just 1-4 versus the line over their last five divisional matchups and have a rest disadvantage, playing the second night of a back-to-back, while the Wolves haven't played since Saturday.\nThe Timberwolves are one of four NBA teams to rank in the top 10 in both offensive and defensive rating, while Utah has the worst defense in the league. The Jazz are last in defensive rating, allow the most points per game, allow the highest FG percentage and give up the most made 3-pointers per game. With those deficiencies, Minnesota is projected to score a dozen more points than what it averages, as the Timberwolves cover in over 60% of simulations. See which other NBA parlay picks to make here, and bet that pick right here:How to make NBA predictions for Tuesday, January 20The model also has locked in two other picks, including backing an underdog to outright win in an A-rated money line prediction.

Last season's Game 7 between the Oklahoma City Thunder and Indiana Pacers came only 72 hours prior to Cooper Flagg going No. 1 overall in the draft.Moving to a Wednesday-Friday-Monday-Wednesday for the first four games of the Finals beginning June 3 means there's less wait between games with the possibility of a Game 7 coming on June 19, which would allow for more time before the NBA Draft that's typically end toward the end of the month. The revised NBA Finals schedule does not cut into the standard rest cycle between games while also maintaining the travel day when the series shifts between cities.NBA Finals 2026 scheduleGame 1: Wednesday, June 3Game 2: Friday, June 5Game 3: Monday, June 8Game 4: Wednesday, June 10Game 5: Saturday, June 13 (if necessary)Game 6: Tuesday, June 16 (if necessary)Game 7: Friday, June 19 (if necessary)League commissioner Adam Silver said last June the NBA is also considering the return of the giant midcourt Finals logos for 2026 after doing away with them in 2014. By Game 2 of the OKC-Indiana series in 2025, the NBA utilized digital graphics on court during broadcasts, but the negative response was heard loud and clear.\"To be honest, I hadn't thought all that much about it until I [saw] it [on social media],\" Silver said. \"I'm nostalgic, as well, for certain things. And also, I think for a media-driven culture, whether it's people watching live or seeing those images on social media. It's nice when you're looking back on highlights and they stand out because you see that trophy logo or some other indication that it's a special event. So, we'll look at it.\"\nOn-court graphics often cause slippery conditions, according to player complaints through the years.\n            \n    ",

The promotion begins with Paramount+ on Saturday night in Las Vegas with UFC 324 at the T-Mobile Arena. The main event sees an interim lightweight title fight between Justin Gaethje and Paddy Pimblett.The pair are set to square off for a piece of the gold at 155 pounds while current titleholder Ilia Topuria remains idle. The hope is for Saturday's winner to eventually face Topuria later this year.Gaethje, the all-action veteran, has been in this position before. He previously held the interim lightweight title when he defeated Tony Ferguson in 2020. However, he has yet to hold the full championship after suffering defeats against Khabib Nurmagomedov and Charles Oliveira. \"The Highlight\" has managed to stay relevant late in his career, including a second win over Rafael Fiziev in March 2025.Pimblett, meanwhile, is a man on the rise as he looks to get his first piece of UFC gold. The Brit is undefeated in seven trips to the Octagon, including an impressive TKO of Michael Chandler last April. Gaethje represents by far the biggest test of Pimblett's young career.The rest of the main card is loaded with interesting and important matchups within each division. The co-main event sees former bantamweight champion Sean O'Malley look to get back on track -- and hold his position in the division -- when he takes on rising contender Song Yadong. Plus, powerful heavyweights are set to collide when veteran and fan favorite Derrick Lewis returns to take on fast rising contender Waldo Cortes-Acosta.

    "body": "\n        The 2026 American Express tees off on Thursday from the Pete Dye Stadium Course in La Quinta, Calif., for the second PGA Tour event of the 2026 season. However, it's the season debut for World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler, and his presence is sure to bring additional attention to this tournament. It also highly affects the odds, as Scheffler is the heavy favorite in nearly any tournament he enters, and the 29-year-old is the +300 favorite in the latest 2026 American Express odds. Bettors aren't simply limited to betting on the winner when it comes to placing The American Express 2026 bets, as PGA Tour prop betting has become an increasingly popular way of golf betting. The SportsLine model has found some 2026 American Express prop bets it projects value in, including backing Patrick Cantlay to finish in the top 10, which has +290 odds (risk $100 to win $290).The model also likes Ludvig Aberg, the 26-year-old Swedish, to finish as the top European, which is also offered at FanDuel. Aberg has +600 odds to edge out competitors such as Robert MacIntyre (+500), Matt Fitzpatrick (+750), Harry Hall (+900), and more to cash that bet. The model doesn't expect Fitzpatrick to have a rough showing, though, projecting value in him at +750 odds at Caesars Sportsbook to finish in the top five for 2026 American Express prop bets. Before locking in any 2026 American Express prop picks or other PGA Tour bets on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up over $8,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.This same model has also nailed a whopping 16 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- as well as this year's PGA Championship and Open Championship. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting sites. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Top 2026 The American Express prop picksPatrick Cantlay to finish in the top 10 (+290)Ludvig Aberg to finish as the top European (+600)Matt Fitzpatrick to finish in the top 5 (+750)Patrick Cantlay to finish in the top 10 (+290)Cantlay had five top-10 finishes in 20 events last year, including finishing fifth at last year's American Express. He's finished in the top 10 in three of his last five starts at The American Express from the Pete Dye Stadium Course. Cantlay ended last year strong with three top-10 finishes in the FedEx Cup Playoffs, including finishing T-2 at the Tour Championship. Given his close to last season and previous success at The American Express, the model sees value in him at near 3-1 odds to finish in the top 10. FanDuel Sportsbook has Cantlay to finish in the top 10 at +290 odds, compared to other sportsbooks listing him around +250 odds. Click here to bet on Cantlay at FanDuel, where new users receieve $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins. Ludvig Aberg to finish as the top European (+600)Aberg enters his third full-time season on the PGA Tour, as the 26-year-old quickly proved his college success could measure up against the professionals. Aberg was a two-time Ben Hogan Award winner, presented to the top college golfer, at Texas Tech, and he already had two wins and four runner-up results in 56 PGA Tour events. He has 14 top-10 results in 40 events over the last two years, including one win and three runner-up finishes. He had three top-10 finishes over his final five tournaments last year, and at 6-1 odds, the model sees value in him finishing ahead of other quality European golfers, such as Robert MacIntyre, Matt Fitzpatrick and Harry Hall.FanDuel Sportsbook offers this American Express prop bet, and you can click here to wager on Aberg at FanDuel, where new users receieve $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins. Matt Fitzpatrick to finish in the top 5 (+750)Fitzpatrick finished in the top five in two of his final five tournaments last season, with four top-eight finishes over his last six events. He was playing some of his best golf to close last year, and the model projects that to carry into the start of 2026. Eight golfers have shorter odds than him to finish in the top 5, and that creates value in him at this price based on the model's projections. Caesars Sportsbook has Fitzpatrick to finish in the top 5 at +750 odds, compared to other sportsbooks listing him around +650 odds. Click here to bet Fitzpatrick at Caesars Sportsbook, where new users receive a first bet match up to $250 bonus bet win or lose with the promo code CBSSPORTS250BM.Want more picks for The American Express 2026?You've seen the SportsLine model's 2026 American Express props for this weekend.

    "body": "\n        Several days passed between the time John Harbaugh reportedly accepted the New York Giants job and when the team officially announced his hiring. According to multiple reports, that delay was due to Harbaugh's push for changes to the team's reporting structure, which he downplayed at his introductory press conference on Tuesday.In an interview with The Athletic after his hiring, Harbaugh noted that he will report directly to ownership and not general manager Joe Schoen. That swerve around Schoen is a divergence from how the Giants have done things recently, but Harbaugh insisted the change was \"not really that important.\"Harbaugh said he was simply more comfortable with that reporting structure while noting that he and Schoen will have to work in tandem no matter what.\"I think it's kind of overblown a little bit in terms of how it works. The main thing is that it works and that we work together,\" Harbaugh said. \"That's what matters. That's kind of what I was used to. It felt like a good way to start off. Mr. Mara was happy about that. It seemed like it made sense, but I don't think it really matters. We're all gonna work together, and I promise we all report to the boss, and the boss is ownership.\"\nThroughout his time at the podium, Harbaugh made sure to praise Schoen on numerous occasions, stating that he was \"very impressed\" with the general manager's football knowledge.\"The conversations themselves are what led me to believe there would be great collaboration,\" Harbaugh said. \"I get to know Joe, and we start talking ball, and you see he's a football man. This guy lives and breathes football. His knowledge is deep. He knows the coaches in the league. He knows the players in the league. He probably knows all the scouts in the league, too. He was impressive to me. It was a joy to talk football and really dig into some of the plans of what we could build going forward.\"Once Harbaugh wrapped up at the podium, senior vice president of player personnel Chris Mara also spoke about the new reporting structure and rejected the notion that Harbaugh will have \"final say\" on all roster decisions. Instead, Mara described Harbaugh as \"the most important cog in the wheel.\"\n\"I know that's a big deal around here -- final say,\" Mara said. \"He doesn't have final say, It's collaborative. He'll be the first to admit that. If he had final say with everything in that building, he wouldn't be able to do his job.\"\nMara did concede that Harbaugh may have been the only candidate who carried enough sway for the Giants to change the way they've done business.\"Life has plenty of changes,\" Mara said. \"We've tried it both ways, and we're just comfortable doing this with him. I think with anybody else, maybe it might not have happened that way. Everyone was in agreement, so we're good.\"\nSchoen himself addressed the change, reiterating that he's \"not worried\" about Harbaugh reporting directly to ownership. As someone who's been working in front offices for more than two decades, Schoen said the coach and general manager have always collaborated, regardless of the structure.\"Everywhere I've been -- I've been in the league for 26 years -- the head coach and general manager work together,\" Schoen said, via NFL Media. \"That's the only way it's going to work. Get on the same page and go through the process. Again, we've done it everywhere I've been. I'm not worried about it. That's just something on a piece of paper. Doesn't matter. We need to work together, and we're gonna come to a final conclusion. It's always gonna be about what's best for the New York Giants. I have no problem with that. I'm looking forward to working with him.\"Despite all the chatter about the new reporting structure in the days leading up to Harbaugh's signing, it seems like everyone involved is more than happy to downplay it now. Then again, perhaps change should be a welcome sight for the Giants and their fans.\nSince 2012, the Giants have gone 83-145-1. In that time, they've gone through five full-time coaches while winning just one playoff game. It's past time for New York to try something different, and it will do that with Harbaugh at the helm.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        UFC enters a new year and era with a bang. On Saturday, the mixed martial arts leader returns full force from its six-week hiatus. UFC 324's main event between Justin Gaethje and Paddy Pimblett is guaranteed to send fans home happy, but there's plenty to smile about before the final horn.UFC's first Paramount+ card is loaded with action-packed fights. Sean O'Malley, Derrick Lewis, Jean Silva and Deiveson Figueredo are just a handful of the knockout artists scheduled to compete. Then there are Umar Nurmagomedov and Natalia Silva, arguably the best contenders in their respective divisions. It's a stacked start on the UFC's new home.Take a look at three can't-miss fights, plus honorable mentions, from UFC's blockbuster debut on Paramount+.Subscribe now to Paramount+ to get access to UFC 324 for just $8.99 per month\n\n        \n            \n                UFC 324 fight card: Paddy Pimblett getting chance to become face of new era among biggest storylines to follow\n                \n                    Brian Campbell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSean O'Malley vs. Song YadongThe bantamweight title race is wide open. Newly-crowned champion Petr Yan has three legitimate contenders: Merab Dvalishvili, Umar Nurmagomedov and O'Malley. All three have compelling cases. O'Malley's strongest argument is his 2022 win over Yan, a controversial split decision. UFC sees a star in O'Malley: a highlight-reel striker with a strong online following. A win over Song is exactly what he needs to find his mojo after consecutive losses to Dvalishvili. Song has only struggled against the best, and a win over O'Malley elevates him to new heights.\nUmar Nurmagomedov vs. Deiveson FigueiredoThe other potential bantamweight title eliminator is the feature preliminary fight. Nurmagomedov might be the biggest threat to the new champion. A win over a former two-time flyweight champ does wonders to strengthen his case for a second title shot. Nurmagomedov has performed nearly flawlessly under the tutelage of his cousin, UFC Hall of Famer Khabib Nurmagomedov. Figueiredo enters UFC 324 in the biggest undercard spot of his career. His recent loss to Yan limits his chances for a title shot, but upsetting Nurmagomedov would seriously shake up the division. The best part of UFC 324's matchmaking: none of the four bantamweights competing have fought each other, presenting numerous exciting options for the future.Arnold Allen vs. Jean SilvaThe Oxford English Dictionary would define Jean Silva as \"pure, unfiltered excitement.\" Silva is a dogged athlete who knocks people out and barks at them rabidly. His style is transcendent, appealing to all fans -- longtime, lapsed or new ones. He's also facing an important test. \"Lord\" is coming off his first UFC loss, a nasty KO suffered against Diego Lopes, who challenges featherweight champion Alexander Volkanovski next week. Offensive skill and sheer aggression will only take him so far. Allen is a well-rounded and experienced fighter who's never been finished. He's also stubborn enough to bite on his mouthpiece and throw hands if it comes to it. \nHonorable mentions: Natalia Silva vs. Rose Namajunas, Waldo Cortes-Acosta vs. Derrick Lewis, Ateba Gautier vs. Andrey Pulyaev.\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL playoffs are down to the final four teams, with the 2026 Championship Round NFL schedule taking place on Sunday. Both No. 1 seeds will host, though one is a favorite and one is an underdog, per the Championship Round NFL odds via DraftKings Sportsbook. Seattle is giving 2.5 points to the Rams in the NFC title game at 6:30 p.m. ET, and the Seahawks have made the Super Bowl in each of its three previous times being a top seed. However, the first Super Bowl participant will come from the AFC Title Game at 3 p.m. ET, and the top-seeded Broncos are 5.5-point home underdogs to utilize in Championship Round NFL picks.Of course, Bo Nix (ankle) being done for the year has much to do with this Championship Round NFL spread as Denver's new starting quarterback, Jarrett Stidham, hasn't thrown a pass in two years. The Broncos do have the rest edge, and Drake Maye had four total fumbles plus an interception against Houston last week. Thus, there's lots to consider before making any NFL playoffs bets for the title games. All of the updated Championship Round   NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Championship Round   NFL picks now.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters the AFC and NFC Championship Games on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now, it has turned its attention to the latest Championship Round NFL odds and NFL betting lines and locked in betting picks for every NFL matchup. Head here to see every pick. Top Championship Round   NFL predictionsOne of the model's strongest Championship Round   NFL picks is the Under (41.5) hits in Patriots vs. Broncos at 3 p.m. ET. Denver has been an underdog five times this season, and the Under has hit in four of those games. Meanwhile, the Pats have failed to reach the total in four of their last six games as an away favorite. With Nix out, the Broncos' offense will take a step back, but Sean Payton will also adjust his game plan and run the ball more to eat up the clock.

    "body": "\n        Miami gave itself a chance to win on its final possession in the College Football Playoff National Championship but fell short when Carson Beck threw a game-sealing interception. The Hurricanes' 27-21 loss to Indiana came in heartbreaking fashion and brought a disappointing conclusion to Beck's accomplished college football career.Needing a touchdown to take the lead in the final minutes of Monday's title game, Beck launched a deep ball into double coverage for Keelan Marion. A completion would have likely led Marion into the end zone for a go-ahead, 41-yard score. Instead, Indiana's Jamari Sharpe high-pointed the ball, came down with a crucial interception and took a knee to effectively end the game.\"The guy made a really good play,\" Beck said after the loss. \"They were in Cover 2 and he sunk with no flat threat and made a really good play on the ball. A lot of credit to them and their defense. They played really, really well tonight. Obviously in the moment, you react and that's what happened. He made a really good play on it. You can sit back and think of every if, and or but situation after, but that's what happened. It sucks. It's going to sting for a while.\"It was a fitting, albeit devastating, way for Beck's tenure with the Hurricanes to reach its endpoint. Each of Miami's three losses on the year came with Beck throwing an interception on the final offensive snap. He previously tossed a pick to conclude a 24-21 loss to Louisville, and his turnover on the first possession of overtime against SMU set the stage for the Mustangs to score a walk-off touchdown.Dating back to his Georgia days, four of Beck's six losses as a starter included a game-sealing interception. The Bulldogs had a shot to defeat Alabama in the 2024 SEC opener, or at least send the game to overtime, but Beck threw a pick on the last drive to cap a 41-34 defeat.\n\"For it to end like that is hard,\" Beck said. \"It's really tough. Especially to battle the way we did in the second half after not coming out too strong in the first half. For a group that has faced so much adversity throughout this season, to face adversity early on again and battle our way back to even have that opportunity to have a chance to win the game at the end says a lot about this team and about us. Just super proud of these guys and super thankful for them. It really hurts, and it's hard, the way that it ended.\"Carson Beck's college career ends in heartbreakBeck's 19-for-32 passing performance is the final stanza in a college career that featured numerous peaks and valleys. He was a touchdown away from going out on top after many had written him off. That the former blue-chip recruit even had a shot at the national title this year was a slap in the face to his doubters, most of whom counted him out after he underwent elbow surgery just over a year ago. His trip to the national championship game was a return to the forefront of college football -- a position where he once stood as a rising star.Beck debuted as a starter at Georgia in 2023 and immediately led the SEC in passing with a 3,941-yard junior campaign. The offense regressed in 2024, though, and Beck not only lost eight points from his completion percentage but also paced the conference in the wrong statistic: interceptions.\nDespite undergoing a major surgery on his throwing arm last offseason, Beck rekindled the magic of his 2023 season to become the most accurate passer in the ACC and one of two quarterbacks to play for the national championship. While the outlook for his professional future is murky, and although he fell short of a title, Beck rewrote some of the negative narratives that plagued his college career.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Duke has filed a lawsuit against Blue Devils quarterback Darian Mensah, arguing Mensah broke his contract by trying to enter the transfer portal and that he must stay with the Blue Devils to finish the arbitration process. The suit, filed in Durham Superior Court, comes a few days after Mensah announced his intention to enter the transfer portal hours ahead of the NCAA's Jan. 16 transfer portal entry deadline. In a 44-page document filed Tuesday morning, Duke argues that Mensah should not be allowed to enter the portal so the two sides can enter and engage in arbitration the two sides agreed within the terms of the deal to settle disputes. The Blue Devils as part of the lawsuit requested a temporary restraining order that would prevent Mensah from entering the portal, enrolling in another school, playing football for another school and licensing his name, image and likeness to another school prior to a decision from an arbitrator. \nSaid Duke in its filing: \"Contracts mean something. Mensah's actions violate numerous provisions of his contract with Duke University and disregard his promises and obligations to the University. And, as Mensah agreed when he signed his contract, such breaches cause Duke irreparable harm for which there is no adequate remedy at law and, in the event of any such breach, Duke is entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief.\" Mensah's agency, Young Money, is working with sports attorney Darren Heitner to navigate the suit. Heitner told CBS Sports the \"lawsuit shouldn't have been filed in the first place for a variety of reasons. \n\"You can't restrain the movement of athletes from one school to another,\" Heitner said. \"There's no provision in the agreement that removes a requirement that Duke put the player in the portal within 48 (business) hours of a request. There's no irreparable harm and there's a mechanism in the contract that shows how they'd be compensated for any harm, thus there cannot be irreparable harm.\" Heitner said that on Monday, a judge denied Duke's request that would have kept Mensah's name out the portal. He added that Duke's other requests would be addressed at a later date. \"Our understanding based on that is they're going to comply with NCAA rules,\" Heitner said. \"And that they'll do so tomorrow.\" \nThe judge who made the initial ruling that Duke had to submit Mensah's name in the portal was a Duke fan and season ticket holder, said Heitner, and he's expected to recuse himself from future proceedings of the case. Mensah's attempt to enter the portal and Duke's suit attempting to prevent him from playing for another program is the latest example of player and school clashing over the terms of a player's contract. In recent weeks Washington held firm and prevented quarterback Demond Williams from entering the portal due to the terms of his contract. Former Georgia edge Damon Wilson is currently suing the Bulldogs over the terms of his deal. Meanwhile, Ole Miss and standout edge Princewell Umanmielen are at a standstill over Umanmielen's request to enter the portal despite him signing a new contract in the days prior to his request. \nDuke gave Mensah one of the biggest contracts in the sport last offseason to lure him from Tulane, striking a deal that paid Mensah up to $8 million over two seasons. The partnership went well in Year 1 as Mensah finished second nationally in passing yard and Duke won the ACC championship. But a few hours ahead of the portal deadline last Friday, Mensah informed the Duke staff he wished to enter the portal. Industry sources consider Miami to be the favorite to land Mensah whenever he is officially listed in the portal database. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Players-only meetings tend to be a last resort. Circumstances have to deteriorate to where you're largely out of options, and even then it tends to be the last lever because you really can't pull it more than once. They just don't usually happen during a game. In the second quarter. At home. Not sure I've seen a bench confab so public and raw as when Jalen Brunson gathered the troops during a timeout in the Knicks' embarrassing loss to the Mavericks on Monday.\nThe body language there was not great. Whatever he said to his teammates was obviously urgent enough that he decided it couldn't wait. It didn't work. The Knicks got throttled at Madison Square Garden for their ninth loss in 11 games. It was bad enough that poor Spike Lee looked like he was headed off to therapy at the half.\nIt has been an ugly stretch for the Knicks, but losing at home to a banged-up Mavs team, especially when they got Brunson and Josh Hart back from injuries, is a new low this season. Dallas started Cooper Flagg, Dwight Powell, Caleb Martin, Naji Marshall and Max Christie. Christie alone went for a career-high six 3-pointers -- in the first half. He finished 8 for 10 on 3s. Yikes. That is unacceptable for the Knicks. So is whatever is going on with them right now. The vibes are so bad that Knicks fans booed them on Monday. The team and the head coach noticed -- and couldn't argue with it. Brunson said he'd boo them, too. \"I'm OK with the boos,\" Mike Brown said after the latest loss. \"If we're playing crappy, boo. If I was in the stands, I would boo, too. You pay hard money to come to the games and this is a form of entertainment for the fans. They know good basketball from bad basketball.\"\nThis recent run has unquestionably been the latter. Hart called it \"inexcusable\" and said they all need to do some \"soul searching.\" They're maybe one more loss from burning sage in the locker room. Since winning the NBA Cup, the Knicks -- who are still favored to win the Eastern Conference (+360 at DraftKings) are 7-11. They've fallen seven games behind the East-leading Pistons and, perhaps more disheartening, they're a game-and-a-half back of the Celtics for second. The Knicks just had alumni weekend and welcomed a bunch of their former players back to MSG, only for the team to let the air out of the party balloons with a deflating loss to the Suns. Before that, they had a disastrous four-game road trip where they lost three times, including in Sacramento.The main culprit for the recent collapse starts with the defense. It's been below average for much of the season -- and considerably worse than that lately. The Knicks are 18th in defensive rating, but over the last 15 games they're just 27th. \nThe conundrum here is that their two best offensive players are two of their biggest liabilities on defense. Brunson was just named an All-Star starter and there's a case to be made that Karl-Anthony Towns should join him for the festivities in Los Angeles in mid-February even though he's having a dreadful shooting campaign. (His 52.5 eFG% would be the worst mark of his career.) But for all their offensive output, they tend to get hunted on the defensive end. It's hardly surprising that among the Knicks five most-used two-man combinations, Brunson and Towns have the worst defensive rating. OG Anunoby and Mikal Bridges are two of the best and most versatile defenders in the league, and Mitchell Robinson is a top-flight rim protector, but there's only so much those three can do to paper over the deficiencies of the others. Even when the offense was humming early in the season and the Knicks were winning games, the defensive issues loomed in the background. Now they're in full view with a broken team trying to figure out how to piece itself back together on the fly.This is the kind of slide that tends to make people panic. History isn't on the Knicks side here. That has to be worrisome for an organization that last season made its first Eastern Conference Finals in 25 years and came into this season with designs on going further and contending for a championship. Right now, things can't get much worse for the Knicks. But will they get any better?Before the Mavs game, Brown talked about the Knicks being fully healthy and how he was excited to try some different lineup combinations that hadn't been used before. That didn't go the way he hoped, and it's unclear if just shuffling the cards already in their deck is going to result in the winning hand they're looking for. \nMaybe the Knicks shake things up before the trade deadline. Guerschon Yabusele would be the primary candidate to flip for new blood. The Knicks pried him away from the Sixers by giving him the tax-payer midlevel exception over the summer, but he hasn't won over Brown and is averaging fewer than 10 minutes per game. Maybe they dangle him along with some draft capital. They have the Wizards 2026 top-eight protected first-round pick, which obviously won't convey. But it does convert to two second rounders that could be useful. What they could get for that kind of package might not move the needle, but mixing things up has to be a better strategy than simply standing pat given how things are going. The Knicks no longer have the luxury of keeping the faith and sticking with their initial plan. \"We have to play desperate,\" Hart said, \"because that's what we are right now.\"\n            ",

Pittsburgh will also conduct an in-person interview Dolphins defensive coordinator Anthony Weaver. They completed virtual interviews with San Francisco 49ers offensive coordinator Klay Kubiac, Los Angeles Rams defensive coordinator Chris Shula, Rams passing game coordinator Nate Scheelhaase, Los Angeles Chargers defensive coordinator Jesse Minter and Carolina Panthers defensive coordinator Ejiro Evero. The Steelers also spoke with former Green Bay Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley, who accepted the Dolphins' coaching job.Flores, 44, worked on the Steelers' staff in 2022 as a defensive assistant and linebackers coach. McCarthy, 62, is a Pittsburgh native who guided the Packers to a win over the Steelers in Super Bowl XLV. He was a candidate for the Titans' job before reportedly withdrawing.McCarthy, who reportedly turned down other inquiries, is focused on the Steelers' position, where he is considered a \"strong candidate.\" \nBoth coaches would bring something different to the table. Flores is a defensive-minded coach who cut his teeth on Bill Belichick's staff in New England before ascending to become the team's de facto defensive coordinator when the Patriots held the Rams to three points in Super Bowl LIII. McCarthy is an accomplished offensive play-caller who played a key role in the development of quarterbacks Aaron Rodgers and Jordan Love. McCarthy's past history with Rodgers could give him an edge as Pittsburgh is reportedly open to bringing Rodgers back in 2026 if he continues to return for a 22nd season. The Steelers traditionally filled their head coaching vacancy with young coordinators. While they may decide to go that route again, the Steelers' interest in Flores and McCarthy reinforces what team president Art Rooney II said about his mindset going into the coaching search. \n\"It's to have an open mind,\" he said. \"When we had Mike in for his first interview, I certainly wasn't expecting that he was going to be our next head coach. I think you go through the process and be diligent, and hopefully you come out with the right guy.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Wisconsin coach Greg Gard got the wheels turning with a poignant rant after the Badgers' 96-87 win over Rutgers on Saturday. It was Wisconsin's fourth Big Ten win in a row, signaling that the Badgers have come a long way from the UW club that suffered back-to-back losses to Nebraska and Villanova in mid-December to fall to 7-4.\"Everybody talks about transfer portal and who wins the transfer portal, national championship and NIL and all that stuff,\" Gard said, via the Wisconsin State Journal's Michael McCleary. \"Nobody talks about a team improving during the season. Individual player development and team improvement is still vital. That's what we've always strived for. Can we get better as the season goes on?\"Wisconsin is the poster child of that mantra. It is getting better as the season progresses. Star guard John Blackwell has put his slump in the rearview mirror and joined Nick Boyd to give Wisconsin one of the fearsome 1-2 backcourts in the Big Ten. The Badgers built a roster that looked like it could be a top-10 offense if things gelled, but through the first 11 games, Wisconsin's offense rated 69th nationally. It was taking a ton of 3-pointers and not making enough (33% through 11 games). But in the last seven games, Wisconsin is shooting over 35% from 3-point range, over 60% on 2-pointers and has the No. 13 offense in the country, per Bart Torvik.Wisconsin's quick-strike transition offense has more bite, and its dynamic guards can pressure the basket relentlessly because the supporting cast is making defenses pay with treys. \nPlus, Wisconsin is just playing with a bit more edge. Gard dubs it as developing a callus. Boyd isn't scared of anybody, and the rest of the Badgers are starting to adopt the swagger and stone-cold swagger of their PG1.Wisconsin did not look like a tournament team in December. It looks like a tournament team now. So let's talk about the other teams that are improving after a dreary start or slumping after a strong burst from the gates. We can take constructive feedback in these parts, Mr. Gard!\n\n        \n            \n                Bracketology: How No. 2 seed Nebraska's rapid ascension compares to Indiana's run in College Football Playoff\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Riser: Duke Duke is solving problems in real time. The search for a No. 2 scorer is over. Isaiah Evans has emerged as that guy, averaging over 20 points in Duke's 6-0 stretch. The sophomore wing is not just a shooter anymore. Evans is a legitimate scorer now, showing much-improved chemistry with Duke star Cameron Boozer and an extra jolt of confrontational drives. Evans has shot 33 free throws in the last six games.Duke can check that box.The defense has also refocused after a tongue-lashing from Jon Scheyer at halftime against Louisville on Jan. 6. The results back it up. The Blue Devils held Louisville to just 0.78 points per possession in the second half to spark a rally, and the Blue Devils have showcased much more defensive bite and attention to detail ever since. Duke forced 21 turnovers against SMU in an 82-75 victory.It held Cal to just 0.87 points per possession in a 71-56 win. Thanks to a Herculean effort from freshman Dame Sarr, Duke blanketed Stanford star guard Ebuka Okorie and held the Cardinal to just 0.79 points per possession in Saturday's 80-50 romp. \nMaybe most importantly, Duke has taken real strides with its once-leaky transition defense, holding Stanford, Cal and SMU to just 20 transition possessions total. When Duke can get its halfcourt defense set, this unit can be as disruptive as any team out there.Cameron Boozer's consistent dominance keeps Duke's floor high, but Evans' emergence as the No. 2 guy and a reengaged defense are essential tentpoles for Duke to reach the peak of its powers.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Faller: Georgetown Georgetown's 5-0 start -- including wins over healthy Maryland on the road and a good Clemson club -- is all but a distant memory. The Hoyas have sunk all the way to No. 101 on KenPom after Saturday's 64-62 loss to No. 2 UConn. \nMaybe the most damning thing about Georgetown basketball is that there isn't one or two things to fix. The leaks are coming from everywhere. When the defense is getting stops against DePaul, the offense is MIA and shoots 1-for 23 from the field in the second half. When the offense hums against Creighton, the defense can't close the game out in winning time. The point guard play is not good enough. The defense is not good enough.The best offensive lineup can't get a stop, and the best defensive lineup can't generate a good shot, so Ed Cooley is playing whack-a-mole with his ever-changing rotation. Questioning these roster-building decisions is also fair. This team didn't look like a strong 3-point shooting team on paper in the spring, and that has reared its ugly head in the winter. Only two high-major teams (Arizona and Seton Hall) have made fewer triples than Georgetown. \nCooley hasn't helped himself either. Chucking an empty water bottle into the stands where it hit a child after a brutal last-second loss to Xavier can't happen, and then Saturday's doozy of a quote made the rounds.\"There's a lot worse happening than Georgetown losing a basketball game,\" Cooley said. \"Around the world, around our city, around our community. You know what we are? We're blessed. We're blessed to be 9-9, we're blessed to be 1-6 in the league. It could be a lot worse.\"Georgetown showed glimpses of a tough, nasty unit in November that could use grit and athleticism to rise above some of the shaky teams in the middle of the Big East. Instead of building on that version of Georgetown basketball, the Hoyas have regressed to the basement of the worst high-major league in college basketball.\nFreshman Meleek Thomas is Arkansas' second-leading scorer this season. \n                                                                    Imagn Images\n                                                            First Team All-Bench selectionsLet's show some love to the best backups at each position. To make the cut, one must have four or fewer starts on their resume this year.Point guard: Chance Mallory, VirginiaKey numbers: 10.1 points, 4.1 rebounds, 3.7 assists, 36% from 3-point range in 24.5 minutesThe scout: Mallory instantly changes the tenor of the game for Virginia. His blazing speed and hounding pressure defense has provided a jolt for UVa all season long. Mallory has 23 assists and just six turnovers in six ACC games, and he's a pest in all the best ways. Mallory's top similarity score on KenPom is former Tennessee guard Zakai Zeigler. It's eerily fitting. \nShooting guard: Meleek Thomas, ArkansasKey numbers: 15.3 points, 3.6 rebounds, 2.8 assists, 39% from 3-point range in 26.8 minutesThe scout: Bucket. Driller. Assassin. All the adjectives apply to the best sixth man in the SEC.Wing: Kellen Thames, Saint LouisKey numbers: 10.6 points, 5.8 rebounds, 2.2 assists, 1.8 steals in 17.5 minutesThe scout: Thames is reaping the rewards of simplifying his game. The 6-foot-6, 210-pound wing is a voracious defender who will pick your pocket and take it the other way for a jam. He's thrived as a cutter and driver in this gorgeous Saint Louis offense, and he ranks second in the Atlantic 10 in steal percentage.\nForward: Tobe Awaka, ArizonaKey numbers: 10.7 points, 9.8 rebounds, 1.1 assists in 20.8 minutesThe scout: Awaka is leading the country in offensive rebound percentage at 6-8. He is ludicrous. The power, violence and relentlessness he plays with is exceptional.Center: Zvonimir Ivisic, IllinoisKey numbers: 8.0 points, 5.2 rebounds, 2.4 blocks, 37% from 3-point range in 17.0 minutesThe scout: Illinois' offense does not have to change much when Zvonimir Ivisic checks in for his twin brother, Tomi. Ivisic ranks third in the country with a soaring 14.8 block percentage. It's the highest block percentage an Illinois player has ever posted since KenPom began tracking the stat ahead of the 2001-02 season. He very well could be the best shot-blocker in Illinois basketball history. Ivisic has also bought all the way in on attacking the offensive glass to go along with his pretty 3-point stroke. The 7-2 center is playing winning basketball for the first time in his career.\nSecond Team All-Bench selectionsG Dior Johnson, Tarleton State: Johnson doesn't start for Tarleton State, so he's not allowed to start for this hypothetical team, either. But man, can the well-traveled Johnson get buckets. He gave Baylor a 42-burger earlier this season and is averaging over 24 points a game with some of the wildest substitution patterns out there.Wing Billy Richmond, Arkansas: Richmond's relentless motor is his superpower. The supercharged wing rarely takes a play off and can impact the game on both ends with his hustle and power. He is an NBA athlete who is a jumper away from playing in the league.Wing Garrett Johnson, George Washington: Johnson has an insane story. He had to recover from a torn ACL. He had to endure chemotherapy to remove a benign tumor in his hip that could have put him into a wheelchair for years. And he just keeps getting back up. Johnson is having an excellent year, averaging over 13 points and four rebounds a game off the bench for a 12-7 George Washington club with excellent shooting splits. It's an awesome comeback story for an awesome player.F Roman Domon, Murray State: Murray State sits atop the Missouri Valley with one of the deepest rotations in college basketball. Domon, a 6-9, 225-pound French forward, is one of the elite sixth men in college basketball. He stuffs the stat sheet, averaging 12.4 points, 4.8 rebounds and 1.5 assists and 0.9 blocks. He's big, fluid and can score inside and out. Murray State travels to Drake on Wednesday at 7 p.m. ET on CBS Sports Network. C Najai Hines, Seton Hall: Hines, dubbed 'Baby Shaq,' is a complete manchild for Seton Hall. The 6-10, 265-pound center had 11 points and 16 rebounds against Butler on Saturday. He leads all of college basketball in block percentage.Bonus brainfart: Nebraska's Braden Frager deserves a mention. Any list of the best bench ballers without Frager is incomplete! The redshirt-freshman has been one of Nebraska's best \"create something out of nothing\" scorers and is helping carry the undefeated Huskers. He's got so much swagger and a silky jumper.\n            ",

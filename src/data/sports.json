    "body": "\n        It took 46 years, but Team USA is back on top of the hockey world. The Americans fell just short of gold twice in the interim -- losing to Canada both times -- but their greatest team ever assembled finally got over that red-and-white hump on Sunday.When the United States last won a gold medal in men's hockey, it literally took a miracle. A bunch of college kids with no NHL experience took down a Soviet Union team full of stars who may as well have been professionals. It might be the most improbable win in the history of the sport.Make no mistake about it, this one was no miracle, although it took a few small miracles to beat Canada on Sunday. From Connor Hellebuyck's show-stopping save on Devon Toews to Nathan MacKinnon missing a wide open net, the American squad got some fortunate bounces in the gold medal game.\nThat said, reducing Hellebuyck's out-of-body experience in goal to luck would be doing him a disservice. Besides, what championship team doesn't get a bounce or two along the way? That's the nature of sports, and it's what you do with those bounces that really matters.\nAfter 61:41 of game time, Jack Hughes capitalized on the opportunity presented by those bounces, something past American men's teams had been unable to do.\nSo, this was no miracle. It was the result of a lot of hard work done by USA Hockey to close the gap with its biggest competitors on the world stage -- work that started decades ago and finally paid off on Sunday.Building a gold medal winnerAfter that shocking gold medal run at the Lake Placid Games in 1980, the U.S. men's hockey team went five straight Olympics without even seeing the podium. The last of those five, 1998 in Nagano, was the first year NHL players competed. The Americans finished sixth.\nAlthough the United States failed to win on hockey's biggest stage, there were signs of progress deep under the surface, but it would take a while for it to manifest on the ice. In the 1990-91 season, there were 195,125 registered ice hockey players in the country, per USA Hockey. Less than a decade later, in 1997-98, that number had more than doubled to 401,218.In 1996, during that period of explosive growth for the sport, USA Hockey formed the U.S. National Team Development Program (NTDP). The goal of the organization was to find and develop the best hockey players the country had to offer, and it's done just that.The wins started piling up quickly in international play, just not in the men's game. The women won the first gold women's ice hockey gold medal ever in 1998, and they've now won three gold medals after a dramatic victory of their own -- also a 2-1 overtime win over Canada -- in Milan. That program is a train that won't be slowing down anytime soon.\nOn the men's side, the best indicator of what could come in 2026 was Team USA's success at the World Junior Championships. The U.S. pulled out its first gold medal at the 2004 international under-20 tournament, 27 years after the first official tournament.Since 2004, the Americans have won the event six times. They've won silver or bronze a combined six times as well.Eventually, some of those junior players became stars, and some of those stars became national heroes on Sunday. There were 17 American NTDP alumni on the Team USA roster at the 2026 Olympics.\nOvertime hero Jack Hughes was in the program from 2017-19, as was the player who assisted on his golden goal, Zach Werenski (2013-14). Captain Auston Matthews (2013-15), Quinn Hughes (2015-17) and Jack Eichel (2012-14) are just a few of the other key players who were shaped by the U.S. NDTP.Of course, not every great American player takes that route. Connor Hellebuyck isn't a U.S. NDTP alumnus, but he seems to be doing just fine. The key is that the program has helped USA Hockey fill out its roster with legitimate star power on the international level.Finishing the jobBut as the hockey talent in the United States improved, so did the team's performances at the Olympics. The Americans were just never quite good enough to beat out their biggest rivals in a do-or-die game.\nIn 2002, the Team USA put together a good showing in front of the home fans at the Salt Lake City Games. They ran undefeated through the semifinal round, even defeating Russia in the semifinal to reach the gold medal game against Canada. The Americans hung around as long as they could until the Canadians' star power proved overwhelming in a 5-2 loss.Eight years later, in 2010, the Americans got a renewed taste of what it was like to beat the Canadians at the Olympics. Team USA beat Canada in the preliminary round, 5-3, but couldn't finish when it mattered most. Sidney Crosby scored his now iconic \"Golden Goal\" to win secure the top spot for Canada on home ice at the Vancouver Games.In 2014, Team USA and Canada met in the Olympic semifinals. Once again, the Americans were a play late and a goal short. Carey Price blanked the United States in a 1-0 win for the Canadians.\nOver the next 12 years, the United States never had the opportunity to put its best foot forward at the Olympics since NHL players did not compete. That takes us to 2026, where Team USA iced the best team in history. It wasn't always pretty for the Americans, but they weren't necessarily built to be pretty. This squad leaned on goaltending and defense while doing enough offensively to keep opponents at bay.\n        \n            \n                Team USA honors Johnny Gaudreau after defeating Canada to win the gold medal\n                \n                    Bryan DeArdo                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThen came the gold medal game, another shot for the United States to prove that it belongs on level footing with Canada. Just like the rest of the tournament, it wasn't always pretty, but Team USA got the job done with a team effort that started in the crease.Team USA earned this win -- both with its play throughout the Olympics and with the decades-long work done by USA Hockey. The United States will eventually turn its focus to maintaining its title as the best hockey team in the world, but it has four years to worry about that. For now, a celebration that has been years in the making is in order.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        In a career that has been filled with memorable moments, Pat Riley made history once again on Sunday by becoming the first Los Angeles Lakers coach to receive a statue. Riley, who has served as the Miami Heat's president since 1995, was back in Los Angeles this weekend as the Lakers made him the eighth member of the franchise to receive a statue outside Crypto.com Arena. Riley won six NBA titles with the Lakers that included one as a player, one as an assistant coach and four as head coach during franchise's iconic \"Showtime\" era during the 1980s. The statue depicts Riley with his patented slicked back hair and dressed in one of his tailored Armani suits. The statue also includes the following quote Riley that has long attributed to his father, the same quote he referenced during his famous pregame speech that helped spearhead the Lakers' comeback over the Boston Celtics during the 1985 NBA Finals: \"There will come a time when you are challenged. And when that time comes, you must plant your feet. You must stand firm. You must make a point. About who you are, what you do, and where you come from. And when that time comes, you do it.\" \nSeveral prominent figures in Lakers history spoke at the statue unveiling, including Showtime stars Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Shaquille O'Neal, a fellow former Lakers great who won a title with Riley with the Heat in 2006, also spoke in a video that was played. Dwyane Wade, who led the Heat to that championship victory over the Dallas Mavericks, also spoke at the ceremony. Heat owner Micky Arison was also in attendance. O'Neal, during his speech, recalled a practice where he confronted Riley, who stood his ground. \n\"I remember thinking, 'Oh, this man is different.'\" O'Neal recalled. \"You don't build dynasties if you're afraid of personalities, and Pat was never afraid.\"O'Neal also confirmed that Riley -- a master motivator -- did indeed dunk his head in a bucket of freezing water and held his breath for more than four minutes in an effort to galvanize his team. \"Finally, he came up, gasping for air, and said, 'We cannot win unless we treat it as if it's our last breath,'\" O'Neal recalled. \"That's how he coached. Everything urgent, everything intense, everything championship level. And that mentality, that's why this statue belongs here.\" \nJohnson, who became arguably the greatest point guard in NBA history under Riley's watch, called on the other \"Showtime\" members in the audience to stand while giving his speech. \nJeanie Buss, the governor and minority owner of the Lakers, also spoke while reference what her farther, the late Dr. Jerry Buss, said of Riley during his 2010 induction into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\"Dr. Buss was right of course. Pat really was a guardian angel for this franchise, its employees, and most important, its fans across the world,\" she said. \nA tenacious, blue collar player who played for the legendary Adolph Rupp at Kentucky, Riley was a member of the 1971 Lakers team that won a then-NBA record 69 regular season games and continues to hold the NBA record with 33 consecutive games. He then dabbled in broadcasting before winning a title in 1980 as Paul Westhead's assistant. Riley was promoted to head coach during the 1982 season and quickly guided the Lakers to another NBA title. The Lakers then lost consecutive NBA Finals that included a gut-wrenching loss the Celtics in 1984 in a classic series that went the distance. In what was arguably his greatest coaching moment, Riley led the Lakers to a six-game series win over the Celtics in the 1985 NBA Finals after Los Angeles lost by 34 points in Game 1 in a game that was immediately dubbed \"The Memorial Day Massacre.\" Riley's passionate leadership appeared to have a significant impact on Abdul-Jabbar, who at age 38 was named the MVP of the series after leading the Lakers to their first championship series win over the Celtics. \nTwo years later, the Lakers defeated the Celtics in the NBA Finals on the strength of Johnson, who was named the MVP of the regular season and the Finals after Riley directed him at the start of the season to become the focal point of the offense from a scoring standpoint, something that point guards of that era seldom did. \"I said, 'Did you ask Kareem?'\" Johnson jokingly recalled saying to Riley during his speech. \"He pushed me to a whole other level. ... Pat was way ahead of his time in coaching.\" During the team's victory celebration, Riley famously guaranteed the Lakers would successfully defend their title. It wasn't easy, by the Lakers did defeat the Pistons in a classic seven-game series to become the NBA's first repeat champion in 19 years. \nRiley later enjoyed successful coaching stops with the New York Knicks and Miami Heat. In 1994, he led the Knicks to their first NBA Finals appearance in 21 years. In Miami, he coached the Heat to their first title before overseeing the franchise's last two championship wins as team president. \"Pat could build different identities in different cities,\" Wade said during his speech. \"Showtime to grit, it's the same standard, it's the same leadership. Just a little different style.\" As he concluded his speech, Riley fittingly alluded to the Lakers' arch rival, whom they would face yet again later in the day. \n\"The time has come to kick some ass,\" Riley told the crowd. \"The time has come to kick some Boston ass.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Kentucky dropped its third consecutive game Saturday in a 75-74 loss at Auburn, and it came in controversial fashion. Coach Mark Pope was audibly frustrated with the officials who whistled the Wildcats for a pivotal foul which set up a game-winning bucket for Auburn's Elyjah Freeman. After dancing around criticism of the officials during his postgame media availability, Pope could be heard on a hot mic laying into the SEC and the crew that called the contest.\"If those mother-effers try to fine me, screw 'em,\" Pope said after he left the media room. \"I did not say a word about how they cheated us.\"Pope's frustration stemmed from a critical call with 14.3 seconds to play. Leading by a point, the Wildcats inbounded from underneath their own basket when a whistle blew the play dead. Officials called Collin Chandler for an offensive foul when he shoved Auburn's Kevin Overton to the floor to gain separation. While Chandler clearly extended both arms on the shove, Pope was bewildered by the call.In Kentucky's defense, there was mutual contact between the players. Overton wrapped one of his arms around Chandler's back before the push-off for what could have been called a holding foul.\nBefore his comments on the hot mic, Pope addressed the situation with care not to place direct blame on the officials.\"We're not allowed to talk about the referees, but you guys saw it, and I think sometimes it's just super personal,\" Pope said. \"I'm not allowed to comment on the referees. I won't comment on the referees. It's unfortunate. It didn't cost us the game. We're in control of the game, so we'll find ways to go win.\"The foul turned the ball over to Auburn, which scored a game-winning basket on the ensuing possession. KeShawn Murphy missed a close-range shot, but Freeman flew in for the rebound and tipped in a putback with 1.1 seconds remaining, pushing the Tigers on top by a point.\n\"We refuse to give control to people that are outside of our program,\" Pope said. \"Refuse. Regardless of how personal it might get or how bad it might get. We refuse to give control to fans, to give control to anybody else associated with this game, regardless of how blatantly people are trying to make this not happen.\"We're not giving away our power. We're not. We don't make excuses. We don't do that regardless of what is happening, regardless of how disgraceful things are. We don't give away our power regardless of how embarrassing, personal, awful, unacceptable things are. We refuse to give away our power.\"Every loss for Kentucky adds to the disappointment of what initially projected to be a national championship-contending season. The Wildcats slipped to 17-10 with the defeat and are a projected No. 6 seed in the NCAA Tournament, per CBS Sports bracketology.\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe Boston Celtics were red-hot as they entered the All-Star break, winning six of their last seven games. They picked up where they left off after the hiatus as they began a four-game road trip with a 121-110 triumph over the Golden State Warriors.Boston (36-19) attempts to continue its surge when it takes on the Los Angeles Lakers (34-21) at 6:30 p.m. ET on Sunday at Crypto.com Arena.The Celtics have gone 12-4 since suffering back-to-back losses against the San Antonio Spurs and Indiana Pacers in mid-January. They now look to complete a sweep of the two-game season series after having trounced the Lakers 126-105 at home on Dec. 5.Los Angeles also has been playing well of late, winning 10 of its last 15 contests. The Lakers edged the Los Angeles Clippers 125-122 on Friday in their return from the All-Star break.There are 10 other games on Sunday's NBA schedule, including a matchup between the Orlando Magic (29-26) and host Clippers (27-29) at 9 p.m. ET at the Intuit Dome. The Magic cruised past the Clippers 129-101 at home in November to end their four-game losing streak in the all-time series.Meanwhile, the Warriors (29-27) hope to get on track when they host the Denver Nuggets (36-21) at 3:30 p.m. ET at the Chase Center in San Francisco. Golden State has lost back-to-back contests and eight of 12 since enjoying a four-game winning streak in mid-January.More than 20 games are on Sunday's college basketball slate, one of which is a Big Ten Conference clash that has Iowa (19-7) facing No. 24 Wisconsin (18-8) at 4 p.m. ET at the Kohl Center in Madison. The Hawkeyes are seeking their second straight victory against a ranked opponent after getting past No. 9 Nebraska 57-52 last Tuesday.The Nuggets are 6.5-point favorites against the Warriors in the latest consensus NBA odds, while the Celtics are 1.5-point favorites against the Lakers. The Clippers are 2.5-point favorites over the Magic and Wisconsin is a 3.5-point favorite against Iowa.Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Sunday, Feb. 22. All times EasternNBA best bets, where to watchNuggets at WarriorsTime: 3:30 p.m. | Location: San Francisco | TV: ABC | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Warriors +6.5 (-113) | Expert: Gui Santos Over 11.5 points (-123, PropBetGuy)The Nuggets were edged by the Clippers 115-114 in their return from the All-Star break but rebounded the following night, demolishing the Portland Trail Blazers by 54 points. Denver set a franchise record for most points in a road game with 157 in that victory. The Warriors have suffered back-to-back losses, but the SportsLine Projection Model doesn't believe they'll get trounced like Portland did as they cover the spread in 62% of its simulations. Golden State's Gui Santos is averaging only six points per game this season but has recorded at least 13 in seven of his last eight outings, and SportsLine props expert PropBetGuy (98-71, +1537 on his last 169 NBA player prop picks) likes the trend to continue. The 23-year-old forward faces a Denver defense that forces the action to secondary scorers and allows spot-up shots as the third-highest frequency in the league.Celtics at LakersTime: 6:30 p.m. | Location: Los Angeles | TV: NBC | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Celtics -131 | Expert: Payton Pritchard Over 5.5 assists (-139, Larry Hartstein)The Celtics are 18-10 on the road this season and have won three straight away from home. The Lakers were without both LeBron James and Luka Doncic in their 21-point loss at Boston earlier this season, but the SportsLine Projection Model doesn't think their presence on Sunday will be enough as its simulations have the Celtics winning 70% of the time. Payton Pritchard, who is averaging 5.4 assists this campaign, registered six in the first meeting with the Lakers also had a half-dozen against the Warriors on Thursday. SportsLine expert Larry Hartstein thinks the 28-year-old guard will reach that total against a Lakers squad that is allowing the eighth-most assists (27.5) per contest this season.Magic at ClippersTime: 9 p.m. | Location: Inglewood, Cal. | TV: NBA TV | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine pick -- Model: Clippers -135The Clippers will be looking to avenge their 28-point loss in Orlando and post their fifth victory in six meetings with the Magic. They'll definitely be more rested for this matchup as they last played on Friday while Orlando is coming off a 113-110 double-overtime loss to the Suns in Phoenix on Saturday night. The SportsLine Projection Model has the Clippers winning in 72% of its simulations.CBB best bets, where to watchIowa at No. 24 WisconsinTime: 4 p.m. | Location: Madison, Wisc. | TV: FS1 | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Over 147.5 (-109) | Expert: Wisconsin -2.5 (-110, Bruce Marshall)The Hawkeyes are the top defensive team in the Big Ten and ninth in the nation as they are allowing an average of 64.4 points. However, they yielded 70 or more points in four consecutive games before holding Nebraska to 52 last time out. The Badgers are third on the conference in scoring at 83.1 points per contest despite their 69-point effort in last Tuesday's loss to Ohio State and are 15th defensively in the 18-team Big Ten with an average of 76.0 points allowed. With all of that taken into account, the SportsLine Projection Model sees this matchup being an offensive battle as its simulations have the Over hitting well over 76% of the time. Wisconsin posted double-digit victories in each of its last two home games, and SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall feels the Badgers will at least cover the spread against Iowa.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        It's important to draw a distinction between resume metrics and predictive metrics when talking about a team like Miami (Ohio) and the NCAA Tournament bubble. Selection decisions are closely tied to your resume and what you've accomplished, which is a good thing for Miami. The cries are already coming: \"But Miami hasn't even played a Quad 1 game!\"Despite the fact that it has played zero Quad 1 games and is just 1-0 in Quad 2, there is a metric on official NCAA team sheets that acknowledges the brilliance of an unbeaten start for Miami, which improved to 27-0 with a 91-77 win over Bowling Green on Feb. 20.It's called Wins Against Bubble (WAB), and it calculates how the average bubble team would perform against your schedule. With a WAB score of 2.18 as of Feb. 22, the No. 22 RedHawks are recognized for having over two more victories than the average bubble team would against their slate.Up next for MiamiThe remaining schedule for Miami which is trying to become the first team since Indiana accomplished the feat in the 1975-76 season.\nFeb. 24at Eastern Michigan6:30 pm ESPN+Feb. 27at Western Michigan6 p.m. CBS Sports NetworkMarch 3vs. Toledo7 p.m. ESPN+March 6at Ohio7 p.m. CBS Sports NetworkMarch 12-14MAC Tournament (Cleveland)TBDIf Miami doesn't win the MAC Tournament and needs an at-large ticket to the Big Dance, WAB will be one of its best friends. The RedHawks were ranked No. 34 in WAB as of Feb. 22. That's within at-large territory. Where it gets tricky is that any loss against MAC opposition carries a significant WAB penalty.Here are all the Selection Sunday scenarios for Miami as it heads down this the stretch with its first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2007 in sight.NCAA Tournament selection scenarios for Miami The simple scenario (win MAC Tournament) Record: Between 30-4 and 34-0 Confidence level: It's a partyLikely WAB range: Doesn't matter\nBust out the balloons and hire a caterer for the watch party. Miami can go 4-0 to close the regular season, 0-4 or something in between. It doesn't matter, so long as the RedHawks are cutting down the nets inside Cleveland's Rocket Arena at the end of the MAC Tournament on March 14. Winning the MAC Tournament is the only 100% guaranteed path to the Big Dance, and it won't be easy. The MAC isn't one of the handful of conferences now offering automatic byes to the semifinals for its top two seeds. The RedHawks will have to win three games in three days against a field consisting exclusively of the league's top eight teams.Many of the players on this Miami team were part of a gutting 76-74 loss to Akron in last year's MAC Tournament title game in which the Zips rallied late to stun the RedHawks. That should only provide more motivation as Miami seeks its first conference tournament title since 2007.\nThe MAC Madness scenarioSelection Sunday record: 31-1, 32-1 or 33-1Confidence level: Feeling optimisticLikely WAB range: 37-43Miami could still feel reasonably hopeful about making the Big Dance if it entered the MAC Tournament 31-0 and then dropped a game. While on some level it could matter who the loss came against, the RedHawks would still enter Selection Sunday with a WAB ranking in the at-large realm, regardless of who was responsible for handing them their first defeat.A loss on a neutral floor in the MAC Tournament would likely come with a WAB cost of around 0.80. If Miami lost 0.80 in WAB today, it would drop the RedHawks  from No. 34 in the metric to the low 40s.\nThe team with the best WAB ranking left out of last year's field was West Virginia, which arrived at Selection Sunday at No. 43 in the WAB. The 2025 selection process was the first to utilize WAB, so there isn't a trove of past precedents to rely upon. But WVU's exclusion last year sets a benchmark for Miami to aim for: don't fall to No. 43.Finishing the regular season undefeated and then losing in the MAC Tournament would likely be good enough to keep the RedHawks around or just below that figure, which would be enough for them to enter Selection Sunday with some cautious optimism.Double-defeat scenarioSelection Sunday record: 30-2, 31-2 or 32-2Confidence level: Feeling nervousLikely WAB range: 43-52\nThe double-defeat scenario involves Miami losing one regular-season game, in addition to a MAC Tournament game. This would not be advisable, as it would likely lead to Miami's Selection Sunday WAB ranking landing in the mid-40s, at best. However, in this scenario, the opponent for the conference tournament loss could make a difference. If it's a high-end Quad 2 loss against Akron in the title game, then it would be less costly.The team with the worst WAB ranking selected to last year's field was Xavier, which was among the Last Four In at No. 49 in WAB. However, the Musketeers counterbalanced their lagging resume metrics with a predictive metrics profile hovering around 40th nationally. \nMiami University does not have good predictive metrics to fall back upon. So slipping out of the low-to-mid 40s in WAB would make things dicey. If Miami loses twice, a slip of that magnitude is likely, and it would make Selection Sunday uncomfortable.Three-loss scenarioSelection Sunday record: 29-3, 30-3, 31-3Confidence level: Better brace for disappointmentLikely WAB range: 50-60A 2-2 finish to the regular season, combined with a loss in the MAC Tournament, would decimate Miami's at-large chances. In this scenario, the best conceivable outcome would be that the RedHawks  lose in the MAC Tournament title game against Akron in a heartbreaking way that tugs on the heartstrings of committee members. But it would be a tough case to make. \nWith three losses on its ledger, Miami would almost certainly lag behind other bubble teams in resume metrics. Remember, it's not just about win-loss record. It's about the totality of your resume. WAB does a good job of quantifying that, and it wouldn't be on Miami's side if the RedHawks  lost three times.\n            ",

The two-week competition was capped by a thrilling gold medal game in Men's Hockey where Team USA outlasted Canada to win the event for the first time in 46 years. The 12th and final American gold medal brings the country's total medal count to 33, an astounding number given recent troubles for Team USA in the Winter Games.The United States finished second among the 92 countries that competed in the Milan Cortina Games with 33 total medals. Its 12 gold medals are the most the U.S. has ever collected in the Winter Olympics, and the Americans finished solo second in both categories for the first time in 76 years (1952 Oslo Olympics).In Figure Skating, 20-year-old Alysa Liu became the first American woman to take home a singles gold medal in 24 years after her nearly flawless Free Skate program propelled her to the top of the podium.The U.S. Women's Hockey team rallied from a 1-0 third-period deficit to beat Canada in overtime as well and earn their first gold medal in eight years. Hilary Knight broke the American women's record for career goals previously held by Natalie Darwitz and Katie King. In the process, she also broke the record for most career Olympic points in U.S. women's hockey history.\nThe Americans swept the gold medals in hockey for the first time in their Olympic history.On the slopes, Mikaela Shiffrin took home gold in the Women's Slalom, her fourth Olympic medal and third gold medal overall. Jordan Stolz claimed three Olympic medals (two gold, one silver) in Speed Skating, the most by an American since Eric Heiden won five gold medals at the 1980 Lake Placid Olympics.Norway defended its crown as the most-awarded country in the Winter Olympics, from both the 2022 Beijing Games and all-time. The Norwegians won 18 gold medals and 41 total medals in Milan, Italy.\nHere's a breakdown of the final medal count for every country at the 2026 Winter Olympics.COUNTRYGOLDSILVERBRONZETOTAL\n            \n        \n    \n        NOR\n    \n    \n        Norway\n    \n\n    18121141\n            \n        \n    \n        USA\n    \n    \n        United States\n    \n\n    1212933\n            \n        \n    \n        NED\n    \n    \n        Netherlands\n    \n\n    107320\n            \n        \n    \n        ITA\n    \n    \n        Italy\n    \n\n    1061430\n            \n        \n    \n        GER\n    \n    \n        Germany\n    \n\n    810826\n            \n        \n    \n        FRA\n    \n    \n        France\n    \n\n    89623\n            \n        \n    \n        SWE\n    \n    \n        Sweden\n    \n\n    86418\n            \n        \n    \n        SUI\n    \n    \n        Switzerland\n    \n\n    69823\n            \n        \n    \n        AUT\n    \n    \n        Austria\n    \n\n    58518\n            \n        \n    \n        JPN\n    \n    \n        Japan\n    \n\n    571224\n            \n        \n    \n        CAN\n    \n    \n        Canada\n    \n\n    561021\n            \n        \n    \n        CHN\n    \n    \n        China\n    \n\n    54615\n            \n        \n    \n        KOR\n    \n    \n        South Korea\n    \n\n    34310\n            \n        \n    \n        AUS\n    \n    \n        Australia\n    \n\n    3216\n            \n        \n    \n        GBR\n    \n    \n        Great Britain\n    \n\n    3115\n            \n        \n    \n        CZE\n    \n    \n        Czechia \n    \n\n    2215\n            \n        \n    \n        SLO\n    \n    \n        Slovenia\n    \n\n    2114\n            \n        \n    \n        ESP\n    \n    \n        Spain\n    \n\n    1023\n            \n        \n    \n        BRA\n    \n    \n        Brazil\n    \n\n    1001\n            \n        \n    \n        KAZ\n    \n    \n        Kazakhstan\n    \n\n    1001\n            \n        \n    \n        POL\n    \n    \n        Poland\n    \n\n    0314\n            \n        \n    \n        NZL\n    \n    \n        New Zealand\n    \n\n    0213\n            \n        \n    \n        FIN\n    \n    \n        Finland\n    \n\n    0156\n            \n        \n    \n        LAT\n    \n    \n        Latvia\n    \n\n    0112\n            \n        \n    \n        DEN\n    \n    \n        Denmark\n    \n\n    0101\n            \n        \n    \n        EST\n    \n    \n        Estonia\n    \n\n    0101\n            \n        \n    \n        GEO\n    \n    \n        Georgia\n    \n\n    0101\n            \n        \n    \n        BUL\n    \n    \n        Bulgaria\n    \n\n    0022\n            \n        \n    \n        BEL\n    \n    \n        Belgium\n    \n\n    0011\n            \n",

    "body": "\n        Michigan State and Ohio State will meet for the first time on the hardwood this season Sunday on CBS in a pivotal Big Ten showdown with NCAA Tournament seeding and conference championship implications on the line. The two teams enter the day having won earlier in the week -- Michigan State over UCLA and Ohio State over Wisconsin, respectively -- setting up what should be a terrific matchup from East Lansing.Michigan State has been tough to beat on its homecourt this season, but it has not been infallible. It is 13-2 in games played in the Breslin Center, with both losses coming to teams ranked inside the top five. That should inspire at least a little confidence in the Buckeyes, who are in desperate need of stringing together some momentum after alternating between wins and losses in their last nine outings.Where to watch Ohio State vs. Michigan State liveDate: Sunday, Feb. 22 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: Breslin Center -- East Lansing, MichiganTV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App, Paramount+ Premium  Ohio State vs. Michigan State: Need to knowBig Ten title hopes: Michigan State enters Sunday 3.5 games back of Michigan in the Big Ten standings and likely needs to run the regular-season table to be in contention for a conference title. Given the way the Wolverines have played, it seems farfetched, but the Spartans can't lose sight of the goal against a Buckeyes team that could be easy to overlook if not taken seriously. Consistently inconsistent: Ohio State has alternated between winning and losing in its last nine games dating back more than a month, proving to be consistent only in its inconsistency. A win Sunday would be its first two-game winning streak since mid-January. It is coming off an 86-69 home win over Wisconsin.\nFearsome Fears: Michigan State guard Jeremy Fears Jr. leads all of college basketball in assists per game (9.3) and also leads his team in minutes and points per game with 31.6 and 15.1, respectively. He's made a significant jump in production from last season and is coming off his fourth consecutive double-double in which he had 16 points and 10 assists in an 82-59 win over UCLA.Ohio State vs. Michigan State prediction, pickOdds below via FanDuel Sportsbook\nMichigan State's 13-2 at home this season and 7-5-1 against the spread as home favorites. I'm taking the Spartans to win and would probably lay the points with them as they prep for their penultimate home game of the season. The way Fears has played of late should inspire confidence, but more than that, this Michigan State team has leveled up defensively, too. If they can find a way to slow Bruce Thornton they can win -- and perhaps handily. Pick: Michigan State -9 \n\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            MSU -9\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Ohio St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Ohio St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Ohio St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Ohio St.\n                    \n    \n    SU\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    Who will win and cover in every college basketball game? Visit SportsLine to get picks from the model that simulates each game 10,000 times and is up more than $1,200 for $100 players on its top-rated spread picks the past six years. \n            ",

The most significant change (of many!) will be a new No. 1 team for the second time in as many weeks after No. 3 Duke downed No. 1 Michigan in the nation's capital, 68-63, on Saturday night.Duke will likely supplant the Wolverines at No. 1 after a brief, one-week stint at the top, bringing forward a fifth team on the season to hold the No. 1 spot. Houston also held the No. 1 spot one week (in Week 2), while Purdue and Arizona also had stretches as the top-ranked team.Duke's rise will obviously come at the expense of its Saturday victim, Michigan, which -- along with Houston -- is expected to drop in the rankings. But with eight of the top 10 teams stumbling this week, voters have their work cut out making heads or tails of how to slot teams in their ballots.\nHere's our best guess at how the rankings will look and how voters' ballots will shake out.1\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    Duke was named the No. 2 overall team by the selection committee on Saturday, the second No. 1 seed behind only Michigan, so its head-to-head win over the Wolverines later in the day should catapult it into the top spot Monday and in the driver's seat to be the No. 1 overall seed.2\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    Arizona won 73-66 over Houston on the road Saturday to claim its second consecutive ranked win in as many tries. The Wildcats are 25-2 and look like they haven't missed a beat without the services of star freshman Koa Peat. They're that good.3\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    A fall is likely for last week's No. 1, Michigan, even if a large fall is unlikely. The Wolverines have a 25-2 overall record despite their loss to Duke -- with both losses coming by a combined eight points.4\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Houston\n                    \n    \n    Another big week would have likely positioned Houston to be the No. 1 team again in the AP poll.

But Wisconsin counters with elite ball security, ranking 9th in offensive turnover percentage,\" SportsLine college basketball expert Jeff Hochman said. \"When forced into half-court defense, Iowa struggles-ranking 16th of 18 Big Ten teams in 2-point defense. The Hawkeyes' defensive numbers also plummet on the road, where they've allowed 74 or more points in five of seven Big Ten away games.\" Back Wisconsin at DraftKings here:\nCeltics vs. Lakers Over 228.5This game takes place in Los Angeles, and no NBA team has hit the Over at a higher rate at home than the Lakers, with an 18-8 mark. These teams just met a few weeks ago, and that contest went over, despite the Lakers missing the firepower of both LeBron James and Luka Doncic. Meanwhile, Boston has seen each of its last two games surpass the total, as the model forecasts a dozen players scoring more than 9 points. With that, the Over hits 61.8% of the time in an A-rated pick. Back the Over at DraftKings here:Suns (+3.5) vs. Trail BlazersPhoenix is 8-4 against the spread over its last 12 home matchups with Portland, while also outright winning in eight of those 12. This season, the Suns are unparalleled when it comes to spread success as they boast the best ATS record in the league at 35-22. Two of those ATS victories came against Portland earlier this year, and the Blazers are mired in a slump versus the line as of late. They are just 3-6 ATS over their last nine games and are coming off a 54-point defeat to Denver on Friday, which is the second-biggest loss of any NBA team this season. The model has Phoenix covering almost 60% of the time. Back the Suns at DraftKings here:\nWant more NBA and college basketball picks on Sunday?You've seen some of the model's Sunday best bets.

    "body": "\n        The 2026 PGA Tour season rolled into the iconic Riviera Country Club in Los Angeles for Tiger Woods' tournament, the Genesis Invitational. The second straight signature event of the season put big money on the line for the 50 players who made the cut as the event returned to Riviera following a one-year absence.Collin Morikawa took home $3.6 million in his triumphant return to the winner's circle at Pebble Beach last week, snapping a winless drought of nearly three years, and history was made at the Genesis Invitational, too, as Jacob Bridgeman emerged from a star-studded leaderboard to pick up the first win of his career.There are few better places to pick up a win at this point on the PGA Tour schedule than a signature event, and with eight fewer players in the field this week, most every spot on the leaderboard earned a bit more cash from the $20 million prize pool at the Genesis.Bridgeman will take home $4 million as the Genesis Invitational marked the 10th straight signature event won by a different player. That's a significant departure from 2024 when Scottie Scheffler won four of the eight events on the calendar.\nScheffler was the heavy favorite coming into Riviera, as is the case every week on the PGA Tour, but after barely making the cut, he shot 66-65 over the weekend to finish T12. Rory McIlroy entered the final round six shots back of Bridgeman but ultimately finished one stroke shy of the lead in a tie for second with Kurt Kitayama.Let's take a look at the full breakdown of how much each finishing spot will take home from the 2026 Genesis Invitational. 2026 Genesis Invitational prize money, purseTotal purse: $20 million \n1st: $4,000,000 -- Jacob Bridgeman2nd: $2,200,000 -- Rory McIlroy, Kurt Kitayama3rd: $1,400,0004th: $1,000,000 -- Adam Scott5th: $840,000 -- Aldrich Potgieter6th: $760,000 -- Jake Knapp7th: $700,000 -- Collin Morikawa, Cameron Young, Tommy Fleetwood, Ryan Fox, Xander Schauffele8th: $646,0009th: $600,00010th: $556,00011th: $514,00012th: $472,000 -- Min Woo Lee, Scottie Scheffler, Jordan Spieth, Alex Noren13th: $430,00014th: $389,000 15th: $369,00016th: $349,000 -- Sam Stevens, Pierceson Coody, Akshay Bhatia, Marco Penge17th: $329,00018th: $309,000 19th: $289,000 20th: $269,000 -- Ludvig Åberg, Robert MacIntyre21st: $250,00022nd: $233,000 -- Harris English, Sahith Theegala23rd: $216,00024th: $200,000 -- Shane Lowry, Matt McCarthy, Matt Fitzpatrick, Max Greyserman25th: $184,00026th: $168,00027th: $161,00028th: $154,000 -- Rickie Fowler, Ryan Gerard, Nick Taylor, Hideki Matsuyama, Tony Finau, Aaron Rai29th: $147,000 30th: $140,00031st: $133,00032nd: $126,00033rd: $119,00034th: $114,000 -- Si Woo Kim, Patrick Rodgers, Tom Kim35th: $109,00036th: $104,00037th: $99,000 -- Sami Valimaki, Corey Conners, Max Homa, Patrick Cantlay38th: $94,00039th: $90,00040th: $86,00041st: $82,000 -- Viktor Hovland, Ben Griffin, Wyndham Clark42nd: $78,00043rd: $74,00044th: $70,000 -- Jhonattan Vegas45th: $66,000 -- Ryo Hisatsune, Taylor Pendrith46th: $62,00047th: $58,000 -- Andrew Novak, Drenny McCarthy48th: $56,000 49th: $54,000 -- Matthias Schmid50th: $52,000 -- Sepp Straka, Brian Harman\n            ",

    "body": "\n        In 2010, Sidney Crosby propelled the Canada men's hockey team to a gold medal after scoring the game-winning goal in overtime against Team USA. On Sunday, though, Crosby looked on from the sideline as Jack Hughes' overtime goal lifted the Americans to a 2-1 win over Canada as Team USA won the gold for the first time since 1980. Crosby missed Canada's final two games of the Olympics after he sustained a lower-body injury during the quarterfinals. He said that the decision to sit out Canada's eventual loss to Team USA was his and his alone. \"I was pretty close,\" he said. \"I mean, ultimately I wasn't able to go out there and do what I needed to do in order to help the team, so at that point, you've got to make a decision that's best for the group. Not an easy one. But, you know, that's hockey.\"Crosby, a three-time Stanley Cup champion with the Pittsburgh Penguins who also helped the Canadians win the gold medal in 2014, said that this Canada team deserved a better outcome than what ultimately unfolded on Sunday. \"I think everyone should be proud the way the team performed,\" he said. \"I thought that, obviously, we did everything but score. In every facet, we were just so good today. I thought we deserved better, and unfortunately, you know, didn't come away at the win.\" Canada's Nathan McKinnon was a little more blunt during his postgame presser. \n\"You be the judge of who was the better team today,\" said McKinnon, who missed a golden chance to give Canada a 2-1 lead in the third period.Crosby's absence was certainly felt, especially on the offensive end. Canada got just one of its 42 shots past Connor Hellebuyck and were unable to take advantage of an extended 5-on-3 power play in the second period. The Canadians lost despite out-shooting the Americans, 42-26.\n        \n            \n                Team USA honors Johnny Gaudreau after defeating Canada to win the gold medal\n                \n                    Bryan DeArdo                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTeam USA got on the board first on Matt Boldy's first-period goal. Cale Makar tied things up in the second, and the game went into overtime after neither team was able to score during the third period. The Americas captured gold during the 3-on-3 overtime when Zach Werenski fed Jack Hughes for the game-winning goal.Crosby said that he was \"really proud\" of his team despite Sunday's outcome. \n\"I thought that the way we played all tournament, even the games leading up, I thought we were really good,\" he said. \"We were tested in some of those games. It's not easy to get to this point, and we just found ways. I thought one of our best games was probably today. And unfortunately, it doesn't work out for us. But I'm just really proud of the group and the way we competed and the way we played.\"\n            ",

    "description": "\n        Shortly after winning America's first gold medal in men's hockey in 46 years, members of Team USA honored Johnny Gaudreau, a former Team USA ",
    "body": "\n        Shortly after winning America's first gold medal in men's hockey in 46 years, members of Team USA honored Johnny Gaudreau, a former Team USA member who tragically died in August of 2024. Zach Werenski, who played alongside Gaudreau during his final NHL seasons with the Columbus Blue Jackets, held up Gaudreau's Team USA jersey along with team captain Auston Matthews and assistant captain Matthew Tkachuk shortly after he fed Jack Hughes for the game-winning goal against Canada. The gesture occurred with members of Gaudreau's family looking on in the stands. \nAfter receiving their gold medals, Werenski and Dylan Larkin, who played with Gaudreau at multiple world championships, brought Gaudreau's young children out to the ice for a team photo. \n\"It means everything -- we all know he should be here with us,\" Larkin said of Gaudreau prior to the gold medal game. \"He should be with us. We love him, and I like that we continue to think about him and I wouldn't imagine it any other way.\"\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Johnny and his younger brother Matthew Gaudreau were killed after being stuck being an alleged drunk driver while cycling in New Jersey. Like his older brother, Matthew Gaudreau was also an accomplished hockey player who played professionally in the AHL and ECHL before becoming a coach. A seven-time NHL All-Star, Johnny Gaudreau was a six-time All-Star for the Calgary Flames. He was the 2017 recipient of the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy, which is given annually to an NHL player \"adjudged to have exhibited the best type of sportsmanship and gentlemanly conduct combined with a high standard of playing ability.\"\nIn 2022, Gaudreau shocked most of the hockey world by deciding to sign with the Blue Jackets as a free agent. He was named to his seventh and ultimately final All-Star team during his first season in Columbus, who has continued to honor his legacy following his untimely death. Gaudreau helped Team USA win the gold medal at the 2013 IIHF Junior World Championships. He most recently played on Team USA during the 2024 IIHF World Championship. He never got a chance to play in the Olympics, though, as the NHL did not participate in the previous two Olympics. \"He wanted to be on this team,\" his father, Guy Gaudreau, said during the third period of the America's win over Slovakia. \"And it would've been nice if he'd been here.\"\nMembers of the Gaudreau family made the trip to Italy after being invited by Team USA. \"Our two daughters, for 24 hours, they just kept at us: 'You have to go. The boys would want you to do this. This would mean so much to John,'\" said Gaudreau's mother, Jane. \"It just means so much to our family, and we're so excited to remember what our boys meant to hockey.\"Their presence was certainly felt by Team USA. \"It's great having them here, and it's super special,\" Werenski said prior to Sunday's game. \"We're happy that we made it to the gold medal game so they can watch that and be a part of it. It's on us to make them proud.\"\nGaudreau served as inspiration throughout the Olympics for Team USA. His uniform was on the locker room throughout the Olympics, and it was on the ice on Sunday when the Americans made history by winning the gold medal for only the third time. \"He was one of America's very best,\" said Team USA coach Mike Sullivan. \"He's just a good person on the ice and off the ice, and I think he's an inspiration to our players to this very day.\"\n            ",

Hughes scored the game-winning goal in overtime against Canada to lift the Americans to their first gold medal since 1980.Team USA and Canada battled to a 1-1 tie at the end of regulation, and this gold medal matchup for the ages went to 3-on-3 overtime, where Hughes asserted himself as a national hero. After out-muscling Nathan MacKinnon for a loose puck, Zach Werenski found Hughes coming down the weak side. Presented with a chance to end the game, Hughes didn't miss as he fired a shot past the glove of Jordan Binnington.Connor Hellebuyck was undoubtedly the Americans' best player on Sunday. Hellebuyck played the best game of his career, stopping 41 of 42 Canadian shots and making some miraculous stops when the United States needed them most. Hellebuyck lived up to his billing as the best goalie in the world.Meanwhile, the Canadians missed one opportunity after another to win the game. Canada failed to score on an extended 5-on-3 power play in the second period, Devon Toews was stopped by the stick of Hellebuyck with a wide open net in front of him and Nathan MacKinnon missed on a glorious opportunity to give his team a 2-1 lead.Team USA took advantage of those Canadian miscues and finished its Olympic run with the country's first gold medal in 46 years.U.S. men's hockey scoresAll times EasternPreliminary roundThursday, Feb. 12: USA 5, Latvia 1Saturday, Feb. 14: USA 6, Denmark 3Sunday, Feb. 15: USA 5, Germany 1QuarterfinalWednesday, Feb. 18: USA 2, Sweden 1 (OT)Semifinal\nFriday, Feb. 20: USA 6, Slovakia 2Gold medal gameSunday, Feb. 22: USA 2, Canada 1 (OT)\n            \n",

For the first time in Olympic history, Team USA completed a sweep of hockey gold medals in the men's and women's events at the 2026 Milan Cortina Olympics as the men won an overtime match 2-1 over Canada on Sunday to claim the Americans' first gold medal in 46 years.The women won in nearly identical fashion with a 2-1 overtime victory against Canada on Friday to bring home their first gold medal in eight years.The United States is only the second country in history to sweep gold medals in men's and women's hockey during the same Olympic Games, joining Canada, which did so three times in 2002, 2010 and 2014.American men had not won gold since the famed \"Miracle on Ice\" team, which defeated the Soviet Union in 1980. Sunday's win came exactly 46 years to the day of that victory (Feb. 22, 1980).\nThe U.S. now has three Olympic gold medals on the men's side, having first won the hardware in 1960. Sunday's victory was its first off home ice in the Olympics. The women also have three gold medals, previously claiming the honors in 1998 and 2018.Four of the United States' six Olympic gold medals in hockey have come by defeating Canada.\nTeam USA gold medals in Olympic hockeyOlympicsTeamOpponentScore1960 Squaw ValleyMenCzechoslovakia9-41980 Lake PlacidMenSoviet Union4-31998 NaganoWomenCanada3-12018 PyeongChangWomenCanada3-22026 Milan CortinaWomenCanada2-1 (OT)2026 Milan CortinaMenCanada2-1 (OT)The Americans concluded the 2026 Olympics with 12 gold medals, the most ever for the Americans at the Winter Games, and 33 medals overall.

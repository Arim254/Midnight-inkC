    "body": "\n        At the end of a charge from third to first in the closing laps, Denny Hamlin drove away to a milestone victory that may serve as one of the most important of his entire career, winning the South Point 400 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway to earn his sixth win of the 2025 season and the 60th win of his Cup Series career. Hamlin's 60th win ties him with Kevin Harvick for 10th on NASCAR's all-time wins list, and it also secures him a spot in the Championship 4, ensuring him the opportunity to race for the Cup title that has long eluded him in the season finale at Phoenix Raceway.Sunday's race, and the complexion of the championship picture, swung dramatically in a sequence of events that began with 32 laps to go. Only a few laps after losing the lead to Kyle Larson on a bobble in turns 1 and 2, William Byron was running second and trying to run Larson back down for the lead, only to be caught completely unaware of the lapped car of Ty Dillon peeling off to come to pit road in front of him. Byron ended up slamming into the back of DIllon's car at nearly full speed, taking him out in a grinding crash and bringing out the caution.\n        \n            \n                NASCAR playoffs 2025 race schedule, results: Complete list of Cup Series race dates, winners, tracks\n                \n                    Steven Taranto                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTwo playoff drivers, Chase Briscoe and Joey Logano, elected to gamble on the ensuing round of pit stops by taking two tires, and a multi-car crash on the restart helped their gambit by creating just a 14-lap run to the finish. But the four tires that Hamlin took would eventually win out: After taking second at the end of several laps battling with Kyle Larson, Hamlin quickly drove down Briscoe and powered around his outside with four laps to go, driving away to earn a win with many different layers to it.Normally a driver who relishes the role of heel and instigator, Hamlin was noticeably emotional over his team radio and then on the frontstretch after the checkered flag. Emotion which came out, in part, given that his father Dennis has been ill.\n\"This is the point where I kind of give the fans some shit, but not today. I appreciate all of you so much,\" Hamlin told the crowd before speaking to USA. \"... [Crew chief Chris Gabehart] did an amazing job on that final stop getting the car just right, and I just held it down. That's all I could do is just go for it. I felt like I had nothing to lose. Just go for it and try to punch the ticket now. And, man, this one feels great.\"Larson and Christopher Bell made it past Briscoe in the final laps to finish second and third, with Briscoe coming home fourth and Tyler Reddick finishing fifth. Logano would parlay his strategy into a sixth place finish, with Alex Bowman seventh, Kyle Busch eighth, Ryan Preece ninth and Brad Keselowski rounding out the top 10.\nThe race, of course, could have been far different: William Byron led three times for 55 laps and looked destined to be a central character in the race for the win, but he was instead left to lament his accident with Ty Dillon, in which Byron said he received no indication that the No. 10 Chevrolet in front of him was coming to pit road.\n\"I never saw him wave. I didn't see any indication that he was pitting, and it was probably 12 to 15 laps after we had pitted, so I thought the cycle [of green flag stops] was fully over,\" Byron told USA. \"Nobody said anything to my spotter from what I know. I had zero idea. ... I was watching him thinking 'okay, he missed the bottom a little bit here' and then he just started slowing, and I had no idea what was going on.\"I'm just devastated. I had no indication, so I obviously wouldn't have just driven full speed into the back of him like that.\"Byron was left with a 36th place finish, just two spots ahead of fellow playoff driver Ryan Blaney, who saw his race end after just 70 laps when he blew a tire and pounded the wall in turns 3 and 4. Chase Elliott also had major problems after his pit crew was penalized for an uncontrolled tire violation, but he was able to eventually get back on the lead lap and salvage an 18th place finish.\nAs Hamlin now automatically advances to the Championship 4, Kyle Larson (+45), Christopher Bell (+20) and Chase Briscoe (+15) now leave Las Vegas on the plus side of the cut line to join him there. Byron (-15), Elliott (-23), Logano (-24) and Blaney (-31) now trail the cut line, but do so entering next weekend's middle race of the Round of 8 at Talladega Superspeedway -- a place where much can change and change quickly.\nSouth Point 400 results#11 - Denny Hamlin#5 - Kyle Larson#20 - Christopher Bell#19 - Chase Briscoe#45 - Tyler Reddick#22 - Joey Logano#48 - Alex Bowman#8 - Kyle Busch#60 - Ryan Preece#6 - Brad Keselowski#2 - Austin Cindric#17 - Chris Buescher#4 - Noah Gragson#47 - Ricky Stenhouse Jr.#43 - Erik Jones#71 - Michael McDowell#35 - Riley Herbst (R)#9 - Chase Elliott#16 - A.J.

Mahomes reached the milestone in just 139 games, breaking the mark that was previously held by current Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who threw his 300th touchdown pass in his 147th game. \nPrior to Rodgers, Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino had the record for the fewest games needed to reach 300 touchdown passes. Marino, who threw his 300th touchdown pass in his 152nd game, finished his regular season career with 420 touchdown passes, which was the most in NFL history at the time of his retirement after the 1999 season. Fellow Hall of Famer Peyton Manning came somewhat close to matching Marino's record, as he needed 161 games to reach 300 career touchdown passes. Manning's 539 career touchdown passes during the regular season is the third-highest total in league history, behind only Tom Brady's 649 and Drew Brees' 571. \nSpeaking of Hall of Fame quarterbacks, Mahomes' touchdown pass to Worthy was his 254th regular season touchdown pass, which put him into a tie with Hall of Famer Dan Fouts and former Bengals Pro Bowl quarterback Andy Dalton for 25th on the all-time list. \n            \n    ",

At that point, they had time to run one play, so Bengals coach Zac Taylor basically had three options: He could have Joe Flacco throw a Hail Mary, he could send out his punt team or he could have McPherson attempt a 67-yard field goal. Justin Tucker holds the NFL record for longest field goal, which he set back in September 2021 when he kicked a 66-yarder while playing for the Baltimore Ravens. As for McPherson, he drilled a 64-yarder in warmups, so Taylor decided to send out his kicker to try and break Tucker's record. McPherson DRILLED the kick, which ended up bouncing off the crossbar and going in. \nHere's a view from field level and as the kick goes in, you can hear a collective \"whoa\" from the crowd. \nThe only problem for McPherson is that the kick didn't count because Packers coach Matt LaFleur called a timeout just before the Bengals snapped the ball. Most teams won't bother calling a timeout in this situation because the kick is so long, but LaFleur did and it ended up working/ On his second attempt, the Bengals kicker came up short. With McPherson missing, that means Tucker will get to keep his record for at least another week, but it seems like it's only a matter of time before it goes down. \nOne kicking record has already fallen this year and that came in Week 4 when Buccaneers kicker Chase McLaughlin hit the longest outdoor field goal in NFL history with a 65-yarder against the Eagles. McLaughlin's kick is one of the just three field goals in NFL history from 65 yards or long joining Tucker (66) and Brandon Aubrey, who hit a 65-yarder last season. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Week 6 of the Fantasy Football season looked a lot different than anything we saw through the first four weeks of the season. On the Fantasy side, we received more data on how each offense plans to utilize its personnel. Our expectations for backfield touches, targets in the pass game, snap shares, and overall usage are often not met, and that's when we have to pivot.In Week 6, several players jumped on the Fantasy Football radar. This could be the start of something special for some of these players, and you'll want to get well ahead of your Week 7 Fantasy Football waiver wire by putting these players on your radar. For more on every player we discuss below, you'll want to make sure to check out Jamey Eisenberg's in-depth waiver wire column on Monday afternoon. Kimani Vidal, RB, ChargersAlthough reports surfaced shortly before the Chargers' Week 6 game suggesting Hasaan Haskins would be the lead back for the Chargers in Omarion Hampton's (IR) absence, it was Vidal who established himself as the new playmaker in Los Angeles' offense. Vidal racked up 124 rushing yards on just 18 carries and added 14 yards on three catches. He also caught a receiving touchdown to jolt his week forward. Hampton is expected to miss more than minimum four weeks after being placed on injured reserve this week. Vidal is a potential short-term RB2 in leagues where you need RB help.Zonovan Knight, RB, CardinalsDespite Michael Carter leading the way for most of Week 5, it was Zonovan Bam Knight who drew the start in Week 6. Unlike Haskins, Knight made the most of it by cashing in on his red zone opportunity. Knight finished with 34 yards rushing but he also saw double digit carries, the red zone role and cashed in with a touchdown. He added a 20-yard reception. Knight will be more of a FLEX play in Trey Benson's absence but could cash in on touchdowns in any given week in this role. Kayshon Boutte, WR, PatriotsBoutte has been up and down in a Patriots offense that likes to spread the wealth in the passing game. Despite not seeing a consistent target share, Boutte has cashed in on some of the biggest splash plays in the New England pass game this year. With Drake Maye at quarterback, splash plays are plenty. With Maye delivering 20-plus throws every week, Boutte is a big play threat in any matchup where injuries have left you thing at FLEX. Therefore, he's worth rostering everywhere. In Week 6, Boutte caught five passes for 93 yards and two touchdowns -- a stat line likely to land him in the top-10 at his position for the week.\nZay Jones, WR, CardinalsWith Kyler Murray sidelined and Marvin Harrison Jr. injured during Arizona's Week 6 game, it was anyone's guess who Jacoby Brissett would lean in on the pass game. That player was former waiver wire add Zay Jones. Jones racked up 79 yards receiving on five catches and was targeted eight times by Brisett. That's a role worth rostering until we get more news on Murray and Harrison Jr. Tyler Higbee, TE, RamsAfter Puka Nacua got hurt, the Rams needed to find other solutions in their pass game. Higbee racked up four receptions for 40 yards and a touchdown. If Nacua is forced to miss action for any extended period of time, Higbee could become of Matt Stafford's leading two options in the red zone and in moving the chains. This could offer him an opportunity to emerge as a TE2.Oronde Gadsen II, TE, Chargers Gadsen flashed his talent earlier this season but his role never grew right after it. In Week 6, with Quentin Johnston out, Gadsen played an expanded role in the Chargers offense. He caught seven passes for 68 yards and played a key role in moving the chains for the Chargers. He was also targeted eight times. Justin Herbert and Gadsen have a clear rapport that's getting stronger, Gadsen was one of the most dominant players at his position and he has one of the most talented throwers in the NFL at quarterback. That's the upside case for a back-end bench stash.\nLil'Jordan Humphrey, WR, Giants The Giants needed to do something about their receiver corps after losing Malik Nabers and Darius Slayton in consecutive weeks to injuries. Those were their top two options, but practice squad call up Lil'Jordan Humphrey was one of Jaxson Dart's top targets in the summer. They even connected on an explosive play touchdown in the preseason,. Their rapport was obvious in Week 6 as Dart connected with Humphrey both downfield and on key third down conversions. He finished with 88 yards on four catches and was targeted a healthy eight times. He is likely to be called up to the active roster again next week. \n            ",

Harrison banged his head on the turf inside Lucas Oil Stadium after a tackle and was slow to get up before being evaluated by team trainers and being taken to the blue injury tent.Playing in his first game at the home of his Pro Football Hall of Fame father who starred in Indianapolis, Harrison walked to the locker room with 6:59 left in the first half after finishing with two catches for 32 yards. This is Harrison's second concussion sustained in the NFL after he suffered his first last season in Week 6, and he'll need to clear the league's mandatory concussion protocol before being cleared to return.With Harrison sidelined for the second half, the Cardinals found the end zone twice on Jacoby Brissett touchdown passes to Trey McBride and Greg Dortch, but it wasn't enough. Jonathan Taylor's 1-yard touchdown run with 4:32 remaining capped a nine-play, 66-yard drive that gave Indianapolis the lead for good at 31-27.\nHarrison, Arizona's top pass-catcher this season with 20 receptions and 306 yards, has been coming on strong after a slow start to the season when he managed only seven catches over his first two games. Harrison said the buzz about his lack of targets was a \"silly conversation\" amid Arizona's unbeaten start, but the Cardinals have since lost four consecutive games.The former No. 4 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft out of Ohio State finished his rookie campaign with 62 catches for 885 yards and eight touchdowns. Arizona's starting quarterback, Kyler Murray, attributed Harrison's lack of involvement in the passing game to simply game plan reasons.\n\"I say it every time, do I wish all of them could get 10 targets a game, of course,\" Murray said last month. \"There's only one ball.  We've been playing this game for a long time. We all understand how it goes. Some days he might get 10, some days he might get three. … You never know.\"\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Carolina Panthers running back Rico Dowdle torched his former team to the tune of 239 all-purpose yards in Sunday's 30-27 win over the Dallas Cowboys, and he let them know about it after the fact. He took a postgame jab at the Cowboys in a callback to his pregame comments, in which he warned the Week 6 opponent to \"buckle up\" for the matchup.Dowdle, filling a larger role than usual with Chuba Hubbard out due to a calf injury, gashed the Cowboys for 183 rushing yards on 30 carries. His heavy workload carried over to the passing game, too, where he led the Panthers with four catches, 46 yards and a touchdown.\"They weren't buckled up,\" Dowdle said postgame.It was the second consecutive monster performance for Dowdle, who stepped into the starting lineup last week. He erupted against the Miami Dolphins for 234 all-purpose yards, including 206 on the ground, as the focal point of the offense in a 27-24 victory. Dowdle issued the \"buckle up\" warning to the Cowboys after that breakout effort.\"I think they know for sure,\" Dowdle said ahead of the clash with the Cowboys. \"I was there for five years. They didn't keep me there for five years for no reason. I definitely will say that. Looking forward to playing those guys next week. We'll handle it when we get there.\"\nDallas was highly familiar with Dowdle and his abilities given that he spent five seasons with the franchise from 2020 to 2024. He was the first undrafted player in Cowboys history to rush for over 1,000 yards in a season, but the team elected to let him walk in free agency after his career year in 2024.\"I know we're going to have to buckle up. We'll bring our seat belts, Rico, and buckle up,\" Cowboys coach Brian Schottenheimer said on Monday. \"Can't wait to see him, though.\"Dowdle said his comments and in-game trash talk were all in good fun and that he \"meant no harm\" to his old team. He certainly harmed the Cowboys in the box score, though. His 239 scrimmage yards were the most in a single game in Panthers history. He also became the first player with 230 scrimmage yards in consecutive games since Le'Veon Bell accomplished the rare feat in 2014.\nThe tremendous play over the last two weeks will undoubtedly allow the Panthers to slow-play Hubbard's return. He has been dealing with his calf issue since Week 4, and with Dowdle emerging as a star-caliber running back, it is unclear how the team may distribute the workload when the group is back at full strength.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Cincinnati Bengals pulled off the most surprising trade of the season Tuesday when they acquired Joe Flacco from the Cleveland Browns. After watching Jake Browning struggle through three starts, the Bengals knew they had to make a move at quarterback if they wanted to save their season, and that's how they ended up with Flacco. However, the former Browns quarterback wasn't the only QB targeted during their search. In fact, the Bengals made quite a few phone calls in the 24 hours after their Week 5 loss to the Detroit Lions, according to NFL Media.\"This trade was the result of an exhaustive search,\" Ian Rapoport said. \"Essentially what they did in canvassing the league was call every team that had three quarterbacks or a viable practice squad option.\"\n\n        \n            \n                'It took us by surprise': Inside the Browns, Bengals and Packers' reaction to the Joe Flacco trade\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Bengals were so desperate for help that they actually called to check in on one quarterback who's actually retired, and that's four-time Pro Bowler Derek Carr. The 34-year-old announced his retirement back in May, but he left the door slightly open for a possible return if he found the right situation. Although Carr is retired, he's still under contract with the Saints, so if the Bengals wanted to add him, they would have had to make a deal with New Orleans. Any possible trade for Carr would have been difficult to pull off from a financial standpoint for New Orleans because the team restructured his contract in March. Also, Carr has been dealing with a shoulder injury and it's unclear if he even would have been healthy enough to play. Besides Carr, there were several other notable names the Bengals inquired about, including Houston's Davis Mills and Philadelphia's Sam Howell. There were also a few notable names the Bengals did NOT attempt to trade for, including Russell Wilson and Jameis Winston. In the end, the Bengals decided to make a trade for Flacco, who was their starting quarterback on Sunday against the Green Bay Packers. Although Flacco only had four days to learn Cincinnati's offense, he actually played pretty well against the Packers, throwing for 219 yards and two touchdowns. Things seemed to click for Flacco during a second half where he threw for 179 yards. \nFlacco's passing numbers won't wow anyone, but they should give the Bengals some confidence going into Week 7 when they host the Steelers on \"Thursday Night Football.\"\n            ",

The injury will necessitate surgery and end Warner's season.Warner's injury occurred when he and teammate, safety Ji'Ayir Brown, converged while defending a running play. As Brown swung round while tackling Buccaneers running back Rachaad White, Brown rolled into Warner's right leg, pinning his foot under and twisting it at a bad angle. Warner remained down after the play before a cart took him off the field with his right leg in an air cast.\nSpeaking to reporters after the 49ers' 30-19 loss, 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan confirmed that Warner had broken and dislocated his ankle. As a result of the injury and subsequent surgery, Warner will miss the remainder of the 2025 season.Warner's loss marks yet another devastating blow to the 49ers, who have already lost a number of star players including two of their best on defense. Warner's injury comes three weeks after defensive end Nick Bosa, another pillar of San Francisco's defense, was lost for the season with a torn ACL suffered in Week 3. The 49ers are also dealing with injuries to quarterback Brock Purdy, tight end George Kittle and wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk among others.\n\n        \n            \n                Jauan Jennings injury: 49ers WR played through five broken ribs, ankle sprains in Week 6 loss to Buccaneers\n                \n                    Carter Bahns                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWarner has been one of the best inside linebackers in all of pro football since entering the league in 2018.

    "body": "\n        \r\n\tZay Flowers trudged off the field with his helmet off, not quite able to fathom losing a fumble for a second straight possession. He put his helmet back on, removed it once more to watch the replay on the Jumbotron, and looked away. \r\n\r\n\r\nThen he reached the bench, raised his helmet to slam it down before simply setting it down in resignation. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe fumble didn't even belong to him, after all; he had never possessed the football. The \"credit\" for the fumble went to Cooper Rush, the backup quarterback filling in for the injured Lamar Jackson, even though the handoff looked clean. \r\n\r\n\r\nBut perhaps that's the issue with the Ravens. There are so many different aspects that deserve credit -- or blame -- for the 1-5 start, tied for the franchise's worst ever through six games, after a 17-3 loss to the Rams. \r\n\n\r\n\"Obviously, I am getting a little tired of getting up here and having this conversation, but we had our opportunities,\" head coach John Harbaugh said postgame. \"We created our opportunities, and we put ourselves in a position where we could have won that football game. Probably, you could say, in some ways, we should have won it, but we didn't do the things that you have to do to win the game. We made some critical mistakes that cost us an opportunity to win the game, and that's really what it boils down to. So, that's what we have to get straightened out.\" \r\n\n\r\nFor much of this four-game losing streak, the defeats haven't been collapses, but rather slow, draining, inevitable defeats. Baltimore was never able to stop the run in Week 3 against the Lions, who mashed their way to a 38-30 victory. In Week 4, the Ravens trailed 20-7 in the first half and were down 27-13 by the time Jackson exited. Last week was never competitive -- Baltimore trailed 24-3 at halftime. \r\n\r\n\r\nAgainst the Rams, Baltimore's defense hung in there. The Rams gave Baltimore plenty of gifts, too. Joshua Karty clanged a 27-yard field goal off an upright. Matthew Stafford lost a fumble. LaJohntay Wester fumbled a punt return but was given a second chance when Shaun Dolac was flagged for an ineligible man downfield. Wester returned the re-kick 35 yards. The Ravens, tied 3-3 shortly before halftime, were in position to take the lead heading into the break. \r\n\n\r\nInstead, they wouldn't score. Not there, and not for the rest of the game. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe collapse started, ironically, at the deepest spot on the field Baltimore reached all game. Mark Andrews got stuffed on consecutive sneak plays from the 1-yard line. On fourth and goal, Derrick Henry was stopped behind the line of scrimmage. \r\n\r\n\r\n\"Every single player and coach would agree that we should be pushing that in there,\" Harbaugh said. \"It should get pushed in on the first one, and if not the first one, it should get pushed in on the second one. ... I mean, come on, we should be able to put that in there. So I'm disappointed in that one. \r\n\r\n\r\n\"We're a big physical offensive line, we got big, physical guys; Mark's a big physical guy, and he's pushing. That should happen. ... Give the Rams credit, but that's on us. That should get done. Everybody -- every person in [the locker room] will tell you the same thing.\" \r\n\n\r\nAnd they did. \r\n\r\n\r\n\"We all know we have to be better and get the ball in there on the 1-yard line,\" Henry said. \"That's unacceptable.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\"It sucks,\" center Tyler Linderbaum said. \"They wanted it more than us.\" \r\n\n\r\nThen it was the Ravens' turn to give away gifts. Unlike Baltimore, Los Angeles took advantage. The Rams marched 76 yards for a touchdown on the opening drive of the second half. On the Ravens' first snap of the ensuing drive, Andrews got called for offensive pass interference. On the next play, Flowers weaved through traffic and fumbled. Two plays later, Stafford found a wide-open Tyler Higbee for an 8-yard touchdown. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe boos arrived, and not for the first time Sunday afternoon. A half-hearted \"Fire Harbaugh\" chant began and quickly ended. It's not as if he was the one who put the ball on the ground, after all. \r\n\n\r\nAfter the next drive ended in the Rush/Flowers fumble, Baltimore turned to Tyler Huntley under center. Harbaugh said it had always been the plan to play both quarterbacks, and Jackson's former longtime backup, with the franchise for a third go-round, got a loud cheer when he entered. He even briefly sparked hope of a comeback by converting two third downs with his arm and a fourth and 12 with his legs. \r\n\r\n\r\nUltimately, though, the drive fizzled, and much of the crowd, already beginning to dot the upper sections of M&T Bank Stadium, left with it. \r\n\r\n\n        \n            \n                What happened to the Ravens? Dissecting Baltimore's disastrous start, plus remaining reasons for hope in 2025\n                \n                    Cody Benjamin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\r\nThe Ravens won't be back for two weeks, after their much-needed bye. Harbaugh said he expects Jackson and linebacker Roquan Smith to be back for Week 8. Harbaugh also said he'll have his team practice Tuesday and Wednesday, a departure from normal bye-week procedure, in which his teams would have a meeting and then be released for the rest of the week. \r\n\n\r\nOf course, this is a departure from his normal teams, too. Last week's 34-point loss was tied for the largest at home in franchise history. This week's three-point output was the second-lowest at home in franchise history. \r\n\r\n\r\n\"Three points is not going to cut it anywhere in this league, and we all know that,\" Henry said. \"It just wasn't good today. ... [The Rams] were just better. They were just better at the line of scrimmage, better overall on defense, better than us ...\" \r\n\r\n\r\nLinderbaum acknowledged the 1-5 start for what it is -- \"The only worse thing is 0-6, so, yeah, it's a big hole.\" -- but also acknowledged there's a chance for things to get better. \r\n\n\r\n\"Obviously not where we want to be, record-wise, but I feel like we were playing hard today,\" he said. \"We were playing up to our standard of what we wanted to do, but at the end of the day, you can play as hard as you want, you just gotta execute.\" \r\n\r\n\r\nThe defense was a bright spot. Newly acquired safety Alohi Gilman's presence allowed the Ravens to put three safeties -- Kyle Hamilton, Malaki Starks and Gilman -- on the field at once for over 80% of the defensive snaps and move Hamilton around the formation. Gilman spoke of how he thought the unit was \"right there\" when it comes to being among the game's best. A previously porous run defense allowed just 74 yards on 23 carries. \r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps that's what makes this week's loss all the more frustrating. The team was right there. The team did a lot right. But it did far too much wrong, and without Jackson, the margin for error is nonexistent. \r\n\n\r\nJackson provides hope. Justice Hill called him a \"generational player.\" DeAndre Hopkins said that while it can't be an excuse for losing, the past two games did show how important he is. Linderbaum chuckled and said, \"It's Lamar Jackson. He's the best quarterback in the game, so he's certainly going to help our team out.\"  \r\n\r\n\r\nBut he's not a cure-all. The Ravens lost to the Bills and the Lions with Jackson. They were down big to the Chiefs even before Jackson left. The defense has to prove Sunday wasn't a flash in the pan. That's part of why the Ravens will practice even during their bye: so that they can build. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhen informed how few teams had started 1-5 and made the playoffs -- four, to be exact -- Harbaugh said he was excited to be the next one and that this team could still accomplish all the goals it had a month and a half ago. Players felt the same. \r\n\n\r\n\"Absolutely,\" Linderbaum said when asked if they could turn things around. \"Absolutely.\" \r\n\r\n\r\nIronically, or perhaps coincidentally, Linderbaum delivered that just a few feet from a quote on the wall of the Ravens' locker room that reads, \"Reputations aren't built on what you say. They're built on what you do,\" attributed to Harbaugh. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ravens can say the right things. In fact, they have. But until it reflects on the field, the losses will continue. Now 1-5, the Ravens have to be nearly perfect. So far, they haven't even been \"good.\" \r\n\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The defending Super Bowl LIX champion Philadelphia Eagles were expected to be heads and shoulders above the rest of their NFC East competition, entering the year as sizable -150 favorites, per Sports Odds history. Fast forward to Week 6, and the NFC East appears to be up for grabs. Philadelphia is now 4-2 after consecutive losses against the Denver Broncos and at the New York Giants in which their offense looked absolutely clueless. That's why the Dallas Cowboys' Week 6 30-27 upset loss at the Carolina Panthers (3-3) is so damaging. With a win on Sunday in Charlotte, Dallas (2-3-1) would have been just a half game back of an Eagles squad engulfed in chaos. It's even more of shame for a Cowboys squad whose passing game was firing on all cylinders against the Panthers.Quarterback Dak Prescott threw for 261 yards and three touchdowns on 25 of 34 passing while Dallas co-No. 1 wide receiver George Pickens erupted for 168 yards on nine catches, a total that included a 34-yard touchdown in which he broke free untouched en route to the end zone. Pickens is now up to a career-high six receiving touchdowns this season, and with a receiving touchdown in five consecutive games, he's just the seventh Cowboy ever to accomplish that feat. \nYes, it's early in the season, but an Eagles offense anchored by 2024 NFL Offensive Player of the Year running back Saquon Barkley has been outgained in total yards in all six games they've played this season. That makes Philadelphia's 2025 team the sixth in the last 85 years with a winning record through six games despite being outgained in every game, per CBS Sports Research. The previous five such teams combined for zero playoff wins. Barkley, wide receiver A.J. Brown and quarterback Jalen Hurts are not aligned on what the offense should look like. The NFC East is wide open in 2025. \nThe problem for Dallas on Sunday was an overreliance on what was an inefficient run game offensively in the clutch, and a Cowboys defense that still struggles to get off the field. Entering Week 6, Cowboys running back Javonte Williams had 447 yards rushing, the third-most in the NFL. However, he and the Dallas ground game couldn't get out of the mud in Charlotte with him producing just 29 yards rushing on 13 carries.That made coach Brian Schottenheimer's play calling on what ended up being Dallas' final offensive possession of the day straight up baffling. Consecutive screen/checkdown passes to Williams were how the Cowboys chose to spend their first two downs despite Carolina having no answer for Pickens in general or tight end Jake Ferguson down the seam all day long. Those two throws to Williams combined to lose 12 yards, and all Prescott could do on third-and-22 is check it down to fullback Hunter Luepke for a 4-yard gain.An even bigger issue for the Cowboys is their defense couldn't get off the field after Carolina began what ended up as the game's final possession at its own 14 with 6:07 remaining on the clock. The Cowboys playing too far off the line of scrimmage and Panthers quarterback Bryce Young's targets in defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus' zone-based defense (86.6% zone coverage rate, highest in the NFL in 2025 per TruMedia) provided too much space to operate, particularly on what was essentially a game-deciding play with the Panthers facing a fourth-and-4 on Dallas' 49 with 2:36 left to play. Young (199 yards passing, three touchdowns and one interception on 17 of 25 passing) was able to hit wide receiver Hunter Renfrow underneath on a slant for a gain of 7 with ease thanks to Dallas playing too far off the line. Dallas' run defense reverting to 2024 form and allowing ex-Cowboys running back Rico Dowdle go off for 183 yards on 30 carries (a 6.1 yards-per-carry average) also compounds the headache on the defensive side of the ball. \nIt's a real shame because Prescott is performing at an MVP-caliber level with an NFL-most 13 passing touchdowns and a top five completion percentage (71.6%, fourth in the NFL) entering the late afternoon window of Week 6. He just needs more help from his defense and his coaches to capitalize on a 2025 Eagles squad that is clearly walking wounded. \n            ",

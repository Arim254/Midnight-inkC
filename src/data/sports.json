    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL divisional round schedule features two games on Saturday, and two on Sunday. Saturday's intriguing matchup will pit NFC West rivals when Bock Purdy and the San Francisco 49ers battle Sam Darnold and the Seattle Seahawks. The Seahawks are favored by 7 (over/under 44.5 points) at DraftKings Sportsbook in what's the largest of the divisional round NFL lines. Darnold (oblique) is listed as questionable, but told reporters that he's planning to play. Other divisional round NFL spreads include Texans vs. Patriots (-3, 40.5) and Rams (-3.5, 48.5) vs. Bears, both on Sunday. The smallest spread in the divisional round is Bills vs. Broncos (-1.5, 45.5) on Saturday, and those odds flipped after Buffalo opened as 1.5-point favorites.

    "body": "\nOnly eight teams remain in the chase to win the 2026 Super Bowl, and we have already guaranteed two different franchises playing in this year's Big Game from last season. Given how the NFL has become more offense-focused league in recent years, it shouldn't be a significant surprise that more than half of the top-10 scoring teams make up the eight-team NFL Divisional Round field, with six of the top-10 scoring teams playing this weekend. The SportsLine Machine Learning Model has picked its best bets from all four contests to lock in its Divisional Round anytime TD scorer picks, which includes backing star running backs in the 49ers' Christian McCaffrey and Rams' Kyren Williams, along with two wide receivers with odds longer than 2-1 to hit for NFL anytime touchdown scorer bets this weekend. Targeting anytime touchdown bets is one way to approach Divisional Round NFL betting at online sports betting sites. With NFL props available for almost every player in every game at DraftKings, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model can help you find value to add to your Divisional Round NFL picks. Divisional Round NFL anytime touchdown picks:Courtland Sutton, Broncos (+215)Christian McCaffrey, 49ers (-125)Jayden Higgins, Texans (+330)Kyren Williams, Rams (+125)Courtland Sutton, Broncos (+215)\nSutton was Bo Nix's top option throughout the season, leading Denver in receptions (74), receiving yards (1,017) and receiving touchdowns (seven). He had a touchdown in two of the final four games of the regular season, and the eight-year receiver is the reliable veteran presence in Denver's offensive room. The 6-foot-4, 216-pound receiver provides a physical threat in the red zone, and Sutton led the Broncos with five receptions for 75 yards against the Bills in last year's postseason. Sutton led Denver with eight touchdowns in Nix's rookie season last year as the two have a clear rapport, and with odds longer than 2-1, the model sees value in backing Sutton to score on Saturday. The model projects Sutton to score in 37% of simulations, compared to his implied odds of 31.7%. Christian McCaffrey, 49ers (-125)\nMcCaffrey has been a touchdown machine over his career, and as we saw last week against the Eagles, his scores don't always need to come on the ground. McCaffrey had two receiving touchdowns in the 49ers' 23-19 win in the Wild Card Round, and with another critical injury to the San Francisco offense, losing George Kittle to a torn ACL, McCaffrey will likely become even more involved than he already was. McCaffrey led all 49ers with eight targets last week to go along with his 15 carries. He had 17 touchdowns in 17 games during the regular season, and the last time the 49ers made the playoffs, he was a crucial part of their offense. McCaffrey scored five touchdowns in three games in their run to the Super Bowl in 2024. Given his talent, production and workload, the model projects him to score in 62% of simulations, compared to his implied odds of 55.6%.Jayden Higgins, Texans (+330)\nThe rookie receiver became an increasingly important part of Houston's offense as the season progressed, which can often be the case with first-year players, and he scored a touchdown in each of Houston's final two regular-season games. He had three receptions for 39 yards in the Wild Card Round against the Steelers, but given Nico Collins' concussion suffered last week, Higgins could be asked to take on more of the responsibilities in the passing attack. Higgins was tied with Collins for the team lead in touchdown receptions (six) this season and was third in receptions and receiving yards. His end-of-year production, combined with a possible uptick in targets, makes him too much of a scoring threat to be listed at odds longer than 3-1. The model projects Higgins to score in 33% of simulations, compared to his implied odds of 23.26%. Kyren Williams, Rams (+125)\nThe Rams have the No. 1 scoring offense in the NFL at 30.7 points per game, and although much of that can be credited to Matthew Stafford's MVP-caliber season with an NFL-leading 46 touchdown passes, that doesn't mean the Los Angeles running back hasn't been a consistent staple in the end zone. Williams had 13 touchdowns, including three receiving, this season. He also had one of Stafford's three touchdown receptions in a 34-31 win over the Panthers on Wild Card Weekend. Williams had 16 touchdowns in 16 games last season as a reliable TD scorer. The model projects him to score in 52% of simulations, creating value at plus-money odds.Want more Divisional Round NFL picks?You've seen the model's NFL picks for some top anytime touchdown scorer NFL player props for the Divisional Round.

    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL playoffs roll on with four games in the divisional round, with two on Saturday and two on Sunday. The latest divisional round NFL odds from DraftKings Sportsbook list the Broncos as 1.5-point favorites against the Bills and the Seahawks at -7 against the 49ers on Saturday. On Sunday, the Patriots are 3-point favorites against the Texans, while the Bears are 3.5-point home underdogs against the Rams. The highest over/under for the NFL Divisional Round is 48.5 points in Rams vs. Bears. Underdogs went 4-2 against the spread and won three games outright during the wild-card round, so how should you formulate your NFL best best for the divisional round? SportsLine's Eric Cohen has revealed his exact score prediction for each game to help you formulate spread, over/under, money-line, and NFL best bets as the divisional round approaches.A SportsLine expert and CBS on-air talent, Cohen has evaluated the entire NFL playoff slate and delivers score predictions and logic for each matchup. Cohen went 180-91-1 (66%) on his NFL straight-up picks this regular season, and was a sizzling 10-3 (77%) on his straight-up NFL playoff picks last season. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now he's turned his attention to the 2026 NFL Divisional Round, studied each matchup in depth, and has revealed his exact NFL score predictions for each game. All NFL betting lines via DraftKings Sportsbook.Buffalo Bills at Denver Broncos (-1.5)\n\"Buffalo is so banged up and now is facing one of the league's best defenses on the road,\" Cohen said. \"The Bills whacked the Broncos last season, but Denver is improved in 2025-26 and Buffalo is worse. It's dicey to put my trust in Bo Nix over Josh Allen, but his supporting cast is simply better. While I think this one will be extremely close, I will lean to the home team in another NFL playoff thriller.\"Pick: Broncos 24, Bills 21 San Francisco 49ers at Seattle Seahawks (-7)\n\"I'll play contrarian here, considering the two regular-season matchups between these two teams combined for only 46 points,\" Cohen said. \"Even without George Kittle, the 49ers offense should make adjustments and find success against the stellar Seattle defense. And on the other side, look for the running back duo of Kenneth Walker III and Zach Charbonnet to run wild against San Francisco's battered defense. I don't like to trust Sam Darnold much, but I'll give him a pass this week. Jason Myers attempted 48 field goals during the regular season (nearly three per game), so look for him to be active again on Saturday night (aka bet his props) for Seattle.\"Pick: Seahawks 29, 49ers 21 Houston Texans (+3) at New England Patriots\n\"C.J. Stroud was bad on Monday night and he's potentially without his star wide receiver Nico Collins on Sunday due to a concussion,\" Cohen said. \"Not good for Houston. Plus, teams coming off the Monday night playoff win have never won another game in the playoffs. But there's always a first for everything. Speaking of, could Sunday be the first time in months that Houston running back Woody Marks doesn't have to enter the blue injury tent? Every single game he leaves for at least a few plays. But Marks did rush for a career high 112 yards in the team's win in Pittsburgh. Behind the strength of a tremendous defense and five Ka'imi Fairbairn field goals, Houston's offense will do just enough to advance to the AFC Championship Game for the first time ever. Drake Maye will have better days, as will his Patriots.\"Pick: Texans 22, Patriots 17 Los Angeles Rams (-3.5) at Chicago Bears \n\"As a Packers fan, I'm still downright miserable as to how they lost to the Bears last Saturday,\" Cohen said. \"How and why will Matt LaFleur be keeping his job? But moving on...it's going to be freezing in Chicago on Sunday. Well, that actually might be an understatement. I've never been in any weather colder than 25 degrees wind chill, so I can't imagine what negative temperatures feel like including gusty winds. How miserable. That certainly doesn't favor Matthew Stafford, who's played the majority of his career games indoors or in mild weather. Expect Kyren Williams and Blake Corum to get a lot of work, while the Rams' defense will force Caleb Williams into two big mistakes. On a normal day, this game might fly over, but not in these conditions. The Under 50.5 is my top play of the weekend.\"Pick: Rams 24, Bears 19 How to get more NFL Divisional Round picksSportsLine's model has simulated every NFL Divisional Round game 10,000 times and revealed its picks.

It's been a rough go without Tyrese Haliburton, who tore his Achilles in Game 7 of the NBA Finals, as Indiana is 9-32 this season. However, the Pelicans are 10-33 this season, including 2-11 over their last 13 games. The Pacers are home on Friday, and seven of their nine wins have come in Indiana, while New Orleans has won only three of its 10 games on the road. The Pacers are 13-10 against the spread at home this season, and the model projects them to cover in 65% of simulations. Back the Pacers at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Cavaliers (+120) to defeat the 76ersCleveland had little issues knocking off the 76ers, 133-107, in Philadelphia on Wednesday, taking a 33-18 lead after the first quarter and cruising to the win. Donovan Mitchell was his usual dominant self with 35 points, as the 29-year-old is fourth in the NBA in scoring at 29.7 points per game this season. He's scored at least 30 points in six of his last seven games, and although the Cavaliers aren't on a 64-win pace like they had last season, they remain a winning team with a 23-19 record. The 76ers are 22-17 this year, but just 10-10 at home. The model projects Cleveland to win in 60% of simulations, showcasing nice value at plus-money odds. Back Cleveland at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Dayton (-17.5) vs. Loyola Chicago (-110)\"This was a very competitive game two weeks ago in Chicago when Dayton survived 70-68, but hardly sure Loyola does as well in the rematch,\" legendary SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall said. \"The Ramblers have been stumbling ever since, regressing back to early-season form when breaking extremely slow from the gate. Three more losses have ensued, including a heavy beating absorbed at GW last weekend. The defense has softened (87 ppg allowed last three), and top scorer guard Justin Moore missed the midweek loss to George Mason, though frosh Nic Anderson stepped in to score 17 in his first start. The Flyers, however, continue to win, 4-0 in A-10 action, and ready to extend the margin behind senior guard Javon Bennett (16.6 ppg), who scored 24 in the first meeting.\" Back Dayton at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:\nWant more NBA, college basketball picks for Friday?You've seen some of the model's Friday best bets.

    "body": "\n        The biggest surprise of the 2025-26 season is Texas Tech, one of only three remaining undefeated teams in women's college basketball. The Lady Raiders have not made the NCAA Tournament since 2013, but they are currently off to a 19-0 start, including a 6-0 Big 12 record.They have already surpassed last season's conference win total and matched the most Big 12 victories in the Krista Gerlich era, and there are still more than six weeks left of the regular season. The last time the program won 19 games in a row was the 1992-93 season, which ended with Texas Tech winning the national championship. Gerlich just happened to be a part of that team, too, as a guard.\"Wow, it's been a long time,\" Gerlich said earlier this week. \"It's kind of crazy because obviously I would love to be on a 19-0 run at the end of the season. That would be fantastic to know where we ended up, right? But I'm just super proud of this team right now for just continuing to stack wins and showing up every day with a great attitude… It's just kind of unbelievable to me. It's kind of like I'm in a dream. Don't wake me up as far as the 19-0 goes.\"\nThe Lady Raiders have only faced two Quad 1 opponents so far, Baylor and West Virginia, but staying undefeated until mid-January is no small feat -- only UConn and Vanderbilt are in the same position.\nTexas Tech's success has been a combination of returning players getting better and embracing bigger roles, as well as good additions from the transfer portal. Bailey Maupin is currently leading the team with 15.4 points per game. She was the second leading scorer last season, but she has become even more important for the team thanks to her shooting percentages improving. She went from shooting under 40% from the field and under 30% from beyond the arc to shooting 45.9% and 35.8% from 3-point range.Jalynn Bristow only started two games last season and averaged 11.3 minutes per game. Now she's a starter, leads the team in rebounding and is third in scoring. Ole Miss transfer Snudda Collins is the second-leading scorer this season despite coming off the bench. Meanwhile, starting point guard Gemma Nunez transferred from Campbell. She is currently No. 15 in the nation in assist/turnover ratio.Conference play won't get any easier, as Texas Tech still has to face teams such as Iowa State and TCU in the coming weeks, but the Lady Raiders have something -- or rather someone -- big to look forward to. They recently added 7-foot-1 Nigerian center Stephanie Okechukwu, who will be the tallest player in women's college basketball history once the NCAA officially approves her eligibility.\nThere's a lot of basketball left to be played this season, so only time will tell if this will be the year that Texas Tech finally ends its March Madness drought. But their early-season success is worth celebrating, and Here are other major topics from this week:No. 2 South Carolina avenges loss against No. 4 TexasAlthough it wasn't pretty, South Carolina pulled off a 68-65 victory over Texas on Thursday night. Both teams struggled to take care of the ball and combined for 42 turnovers. However, the Gamecocks found the momentum when it mattered the most. Raven Johnson was particularly impactful in the fourth quarter, but an unusual 3-pointer by Madina Okot also deserves credit for sparking the last push her team needed. Click here for a closer look at how South Carolina gutted out the win.\nUSC suffers fourth consecutive lossOn Jan. 12, USC dropped out of the AP Top 25 for the first time since the 2022-23 season. A few days later, the Trojans fell 62-55 to No. 12 Maryland, which marked their fourth consecutive loss. \nDespite the recent struggles, coach Lindsay Gottlieb said she was proud of the way her team fought against the Terrapins -- Kara Dunn scored 20+ points in her third consecutive game and freshman Jazzy Davidson registered her 17th consecutive game with at least one block, as well as her 14th straight game scoring in double figures.\"I thought we played our asses off, just because you do that doesn't guarantee an outcome,\" Gottlieb said. \"… I'll take our effort every day of the week. This is a hard stretch for our group, but what I saw today was really meaningful in terms of how we were engaged.\"Marta Suarez hits game-winner for TCUNo. 10 TCU had an upset scare against West Virginia on Wednesday night, but a clutch 3-pointer by Marta Suarez helped the Horned Frogs come out with a 51-50 road victory. Suarez finished the game with 11 points, nine rebounds and three steals, while Olivia Miles had a team-high 14 points.\nThe team registered a season-high 24 turnovers and only five assists, which is the Horned Frogs' second-fewest in a win in program history. Their 51 points also tied for the Horned Frogs' fourth fewest in a win. It was probably their worst game of the season, but at the end of the day, they succeeded because they showed a lot of resilience.\nVanderbilt is off to a historic startNo. 5 Vanderbilt's 18-0 start is the best start and longest winning streak in program history. It happened thanks to an 89-84 win over Mississippi State on Thursday, which included a 38-point performance by sophomore Mikayla Blakes.This is also the first time Vanderbilt has started 5-0 in SEC play since the 1992-93 season. That is no small accomplishment in the toughest conference in women's college basketball. The Commodores have a big test coming up as they take on No. 8 Michigan on the road on Monday afternoon.\nTop game to watch this weekendThere are multiple good matchups scheduled for this weekend, but the most intriguing one might be No. 6 LSU at No. 13 Oklahoma. LSU made a statement with a win against Texas, but as the Tigers already know, nobody can get too comfortable in the SEC conference. Oklahoma will have home-court advantage and will be hungry to bounce back after consecutive losses to Ole Miss and Kentucky.As an extra way to get ready for this game, check out LSU star Flau'jae Johnson breaking down film with CBS Sports. The matchup is set for Sunday at 3 p.m. ET and will be available on ESPN2.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The San Francisco 49ers are the biggest underdog of the divisional round, but they'll likely have plenty of confidence going into Saturday's game against the Seahawks and one reason for that is because Brock Purdy has never lost in Seattle. The 49ers starting quarterback has played in Seattle a total of four times in his career and he's won all four games. That's the most wins without a loss by any road quarterback in NFL history against the Seahawks. There are only three quarterbacks ever who have started at least three games in Seattle and gone undefeated. Brock Purdy: 4-0 (2022-25)Steve Grogan: 3-0 (1980, 1982, 1985)Steve Bono: 3-0 (1991, 1995, 1996)There's a reason this list is so short and that's because Seattle is a tough place to play. Lumen Field is one of the loudest stadiums in the NFL and the Seahawks have historically been pretty dominant there and that includes a 2025 season where Seattle went 6-2 at home. However, one of those two losses came to Purdy. It's hard to say why Purdy has been so good in Seattle, but 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan has a theory. \"I think the big thing is that Brock doesn't get rattled,\" Shanahan said this week. \"You can be as loud as you want, they're still probably not going to hear you there. Especially if you're in the gun. And then we know they'll be that much louder this week. But I think it's nothing really rattles Brock. He stays the same.\"\n\n        \n            \n                Seahawks vs. 49ers prediction: Can San Francisco overcome injuries, short week at No. 1 seed Seattle?\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLet's take a look at how Purdy has performed in Seattle: YearPurdy's numbersFinal score2022Purdy goes 17/26 for 217 yards, 2 TD, 0 INT49ers 21-13 over Seahawks2023Purdy goes 21/30 for 209 yards, 1 TD, 1 INT49ers 31-13 over Seahawks2024Purdy goes 18/28 for 255 yards, 3 TD, 0 INT49ers 36-24 over Seahawks2025Purdy goes 26/35 for 277 yards, 2 TD, 2 INT49ers 17-13 over SeahawksThe 49ers have won Purdy's four starts by an average of 10.5 points per game. Purdy is averaging 240 passing yards per game and he's thrown eight touchdowns compared to just three interceptions. It's also worth mentioning that two of his four wins have come since Mike Macdonald took over as the head coach of the Seahawks. The 49ers got dominated by the Seahawks in a 13-3 loss back in Week 18, but the offense should look better this week due to the fact that it's getting back one of its most important players: Trent Williams. The three-time All-Pro tackle didn't play in Week 18 and he's a huge difference-maker. Not only will he help in the running game, but Purdy should have a little bit more time to throw. Purdy got sacked three times in Week 18, which was the most sacks he took in a game all season. One reason Purdy seems to thrive in tough situations is because his demeanor never changes, according to Shanahan. \"As you guys have gotten to know Brock and all the situations, I don't think when you guys talk to him whether he's had a good game at bad game, I don't think he ever seems much different,\" Shanahan said. \"He's always Brock. And you feel that on the sidelines throughout a game. You felt that last week [against the Eagles]. That's what I thought was so impressive, having that interception with like eight minutes to go, we lose the lead and the way he came back and played the next drive after that is the perfect example of that's what I mean by you can kind of see people's character, what type of people they are on the silent tape. And a guy who can act like that on that silent tape describes exactly the type of dude he is.\"Purdy's 4-0 record at Lumen Field is one of the best records by any active quarterback at one stadium. Only Patrick Mahomes (6-0 at Allegiant Stadium), Lamar Jackson (5-0 at Paycor Stadium) and Jared Goff (5-0 at State Farm Stadium) have been better. If Purdy improves his record to 5-0, then the 49ers will be moving on to the NFC title game for the fifth time under Shanahan. San Francisco is a 7.5-point underdog going into Saturday, but they have a coach who's never lost in the divisional round (4-0) and a QB who's never lost in Seattle, so an upset certainly isn't out of the question. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The New York Giants are working to finalize an agreement with former Baltimore Ravens coach John Harbaugh to be their next coach, according to multiple reports and confirmed by CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones. Negotiations are ongoing, but the Giants reportedly expect a deal will be signed by Harbaugh on Friday along with an official announcement. Harbaugh was fired by the Ravens on Jan. 6 following Baltimore's season-ending loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers. He was the winningest coach in franchise history, going 180-113 during his 18 seasons, won Super Bowl XLVII in 2013 and was named Coach of the Year in 2019.\nWhile Harbaugh won 10 playoff games in his first seven seasons with the Ravens, he won just three postseason matchups over the last 11 years. Harbaugh was reportedly confident he would return to Baltimore to chase a Lombardi Trophy in 2026, but the Ravens made the decision to search for another coach that can get the most out of two-time NFL MVP Lamar Jackson. When the Ravens made the surprising decision to fire Harbaugh, his agent said he received calls from seven different teams expressing interest in his client 45 minutes after the news broke, per ESPN. There were only six other head coach openings at the time. Harbaugh formally interviewed with the Giants on Wednesday with team owners John Mara and Steve Tisch reportedly in attendance, along with quarterback Jaxson Dart, per NFL Media.Harbaugh is set to replace Brian Daboll, who went 20-40-1 in his four seasons as lead man. The former Buffalo Bills offensive coordinator went 9-7-1 in his first season back in 2022, won NFL Coach of the Year and upset the Minnesota Vikings in the playoffs. However, the Giants took a step back the next season with a 6-11 record, and went 3-14 in 2024 before Daboll was finally fired 10 games into the 2025 season.\nOverall, the Giants have struggled ever since Tom Coughlin resigned following the 2015 season. All four full-time head coaches finished with losing records. The Giants have the second-worst record in the NFL (55-109-1) in the 10 seasons since the Coughlin era ended. Only the New York Jets have been worse.Giants' coaches since Tom Coughlin (2016)*denotes interimCoachYearsRecordMike Kafka*20252-5Brian Daboll2022-2520-40-1Joe Judge2020-2110-23Pat Shurmur2018-199-23Steve Spagnuolo*2017*1-3Ben McAdoo2016-1713-15For all of the struggles, the Giants were still considered to be one of the most attractive open jobs this offseason. \nNew York owns the No. 5 pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, has a prospective franchise quarterback in Dart, a talented running back with Cam Skattebo, a star wideout in Malik Nabers and then plenty of talent on the defensive line with Brian Burns, Dexter Lawrence II and Abdul Carter. Now, they have new hope that comes in the form of an experienced coach that knows how to not only find success, but sustain it.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        We are one step closer to Super Bowl LX. The NFL playoffs kicked off with a bang during a frantic Wild Card Weekend that featured several photo finishes. No matter where you looked, playoff games were coming down to the wire across the opening slate. In all, there were four comeback wins in the final three minutes of the fourth quarter -- the most ever in a single postseason.Now, there are just eight teams left standing, hoping to punch their ticket to Santa Clara for Super Bowl LX. As we embark on the divisional round this weekend, the No. 1 seeds in both conferences, the Denver Broncos and Seattle Seahawks, emerge from their first-round bye weeks and enter the fray, adding even more firepower to the playoff bracket. As we gear up for more action, let's take our first look at the divisional round matchups, along with the odds and a quick preview of each contest. AFC Buffalo Bills at Denver BroncosSaturday, 4:30 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nWe don't have to look far back to find the last time these teams met in the postseason, squaring off just last year in the wild card round. Buffalo throttled the Broncos at Highmark Stadium, 31-7. Denver scored on the opening drive, then was shut out the rest of the way.\nThis matchup, however, should be different. For starters, it will be played at Mile High after Denver secured the No. 1 seed. The Broncos also boast one of the NFL's top defenses, allowing just 18.3 points per game during the regular season. They'll need that elite level of play again to keep Josh Allen -- who scored three touchdowns last week -- in check.The Bills quarterback is coming off his first career road playoff win after beating the Jaguars in Jacksonville and is looking to add to his postseason résumé, entering this matchup as a road favorite.\n        \n            \n                NFL wild card overreactions: Josh Allen is the biggest X factor of playoffs; A.J. Brown done in Philly?\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHouston Texans at New England PatriotsSunday, 3 p.m. ET on ESPN (Stream: Fubo -- try for free) \nThis will be the first meeting between these two teams since the 2016 divisional round, which New England won on its way to a Super Bowl title. They last met in Week 6 of last season, when Houston rolled to a 41-21 victory, but both teams look very different now.\nBoth quarterbacks are also looking to bounce back from uneven wild-card performances. Drake Maye threw two interceptions in a win over the Chargers, while C.J. Stroud is coming off a three-turnover outing against Pittsburgh. Houston still boasts one of the NFL's top defenses and showed it again Monday night against the Steelers. New England isn't usually grouped among the league's elite units, but it looked the part after sacking Justin Herbert six times on Sunday night, setting the stage for what could be a defensive showdown.NFCSan Francisco 49ers at Seattle SeahawksSaturday, 8 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nWe have ourselves a rubber match between two NFC West rivals. The Seahawks and 49ers split the regular-season series, with San Francisco winning in Week 1 before Seattle returned the favor with a 13–3 victory in Week 18 to clinch the No. 1 seed and the division title. Oddly enough, both games were won by the road team, but the 49ers will have to overcome some significant injury issues to keep that trend alive here.\nSan Francisco has been hit hard by injuries all season and is coming off a playoff win over Philadelphia in which star tight end George Kittle suffered a season-ending Achilles tear. That leaves Brock Purdy without one of his primary weapons as he faces an elite Seattle defense. The Seahawks ranked No. 1 in scoring defense this season, allowing just 17.2 points per game, and also led the league on third down and in yards per rush allowed.That defensive dominance, along with Sam Darnold's strong play at quarterback, helped Seattle win 11 of its final 12 games to close the regular season. This is the fourth time the Seahawks have earned the No. 1 seed, and each of the previous three resulted in a trip to the Super Bowl.Los Angeles Rams (-3.5) at Chicago BearsSunday, 6:30 p.m. ET on NBC\nBoth teams pulled off late wins on Wild Card Weekend. Los Angeles avoided a road upset against the Carolina Panthers after Matthew Stafford led a seven-play, 71-yard, game-winning touchdown drive in the final two minutes of regulation.\nChicago, meanwhile, staged a miraculous second-half comeback against the Green Bay Packers, erasing an 18-point deficit. Caleb Williams and the offense erupted late, outscoring Green Bay 25–6 in the fourth quarter.The last time these teams met came during the 2024 regular season, when Chicago earned a 24–18 win. In that game, D'Andre Swift piled up 165 yards from scrimmage, while Stafford threw no touchdowns and committed two turnovers.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 Major League Baseball offseason is ongoing and with the new year having come and gone we're working our way deeper into the sport's offseason calendar. With plenty of big-name free agents and trade candidates still on the board even at this increasingly late hour, there's a daily supply of rumors and reporting regarding them. Speaking of which, you can find Friday's roundup just below. Angels, Rays, Reds pull off three-way tradeThe Angels, Rays, and Reds have agreed to a three-team trade that, most notably, sends outfielder Josh Lowe to (greater) Los Angeles, MLB.com reports. Here's the full trade: Angels get: OF Josh Lowe from Rays Rays get: INF Gavin Lux from Reds, RHP Chris Clark from AngelsReds get: LHP Brock Burke from AngelsLowe, who turns 28 in February, enjoyed a standout season in 2023 when he hit 20 home runs in 135 games and put up an OPS+ of 128. Over the last two seasons, however, his offensive numbers have declined significantly. Lux is a veteran lefty bat who has a career OPS+ of 99. He can play second base and get by in left field. Lux is going into his walk year in 2026. Clark, a former fifth-round draft pick, is 24 and reached Double-A last season. Across parts of three minor league seasons, he has an ERA of 5.25 and a K/BB ratio of 2.52 in 54 starts and a pair of relief appearances. Burke is a 28-year-old lefty reliever with a career ERA+ of 110. Yankees, Mets targeting Peralta in trade talks\nIt's not known whether the Brewers, coming off back-to-back NL Central titles, will trade their ace this winter, but they appear to at least be considering it. On that front, the Yankees and Mets have engaged the Brewers in discussions about Peralta as there's an increasing perception that Milwaukee will indeed deal him away this offseason, Jon Heyman of the New York Post reports.\nPeralta, 29, is entering the final season of his contract. He's compiled a 3.40 ERA (123 ERA+) and a 3.27 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 95 starts since 2023. His consistency, reliability, and affordability (he's owed $8 million) make him an attractive target for teams seeking front-of-the-rotation help.Yankees adjusting offer to Bellinger\nThe Yankees remain in negotiations with free-agent outfielder Cody Bellinger, who was a key driver of their success last season. Thus far the sticking point has been contract length, and rather than meet Bellinger's ask the Yankees are proposing an alternative structure, Jon Heyman of the New York Post reports. Specifically, the Yankees are willing to give Bellinger not one but two opt-outs in a contract that includes a substantial signing bonus and no deferrals. Whether that's enough to move Bellinger's camp off their contract-length stance depends upon the market. Red Sox checking in on Paredes\nThe Red Sox need infield help after losing out on Alex Bregman, who inked with the Cubs, and the Astros have infielders to spare. As such, the two sides are discussing Isaac Paredes, Jon Heyman of the New York Post reports. Paredes, who soon turns 27, is coming off a strong bounceback campaign in 2025 in which he had an OPS+ of 123 and earned his second career All-Star selection. He's best suited to third base and is under team control through the 2027 season. \nTigers at least listening on Skubal\nWill the Tigers trade back-to-back AL Cy Young winner Tarik Skubal heading into his walk year? The guess is no as they aim for a third straight trip to the postseason in 2026, but they're at least listening to trade inquiries, Jon Heyman of the New York Post reports. Skubal and the organization may be at odds given the chasm between their respective filed arbitration figures, and that at least theoretically may increase the odds of a trade. Even with only one year of team control remaining, Skubal will command a high cost in return, as he's perhaps the best starting pitcher in all of baseball. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        This week brought a significant shakeup to the No. 1 seeds in CBS Sports Bracketology as our model reacted to Iowa State and Vanderbilt losing for the first time. Both the Cyclones and Commodores have been displaced on the top line after taking lopsided road losses against unranked conference foes.Duke and UConn have risen to take their places entering another big weekend of conference action around college basketball. The Blue Devils and Huskies aren't necessarily dominating the opposition, but they are finding ways to win.UConn's 13-game winning streak is tied with BYU's for the longest of anyone aside from the sport's three remaining unbeaten teams. Since falling to Arizona on Nov. 19, the Huskies have earned victories over Illinois, Kansas, Florida and Texas, in addition beginning Big East play at 7-0. As a result, UConn is tops nationally in wins above bubble (WAB), which supports its case to be a No. 1 seed at this juncture.Duke is right behind UConn at No. 2 in the WAB as the Blue Devils lead the nation in Quad 1 wins with seven. Among them was Wednesday night's win over Cal, which narrowly qualifies as a Quad 1 game for now. Retaining their status as a No. 1 seed will be a challenge for the Blue Devils on Saturday as they take on Stanford while completing the second leg of their West Coast road trip.\n  Bracketology top seeds       \t \t \t \t \tSeedMidwestWestEastSouthNo. 1                                                     \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            UConn\n                    \n    \n    No. 2                                                     \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            BYU\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Nebraska\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    Check out the full field of 68 at the CBS Sports Bracketology hub.Massive tilt for Saint Mary'sThough it sits at No. 28 in the NET, Saint Mary's is among the First Four Out in the CBS Sports Bracketology model. That will change Saturday if the Gaels beat Santa Clara on the road. The 50-mile southward trek to play the Broncos brings just the second Quad 1 opportunity of the season for Saint Mary's, which lost by 25 to Vanderbilt in its only other Quad 1 game.At 30th in KenPom and with a 17-2 (6-0 WCC) record, the Gaels look the part of an NCAA Tournament club. But with 12 of those 16 victories coming in Quads 3 and 4, they need a resume boost, and a win over Santa Clara would do wonders. Our model's initial projection suggests a win would catapult Saint Mary's potentially as high as a No. 9 seed in Bracketology while doubling its selection percentage from 41.4% to 83%.Our initial projection suggests a loss would leave the Gaels with just an 16.2% chance of making the Big Dance. Such a scenario would attach massive stakes to two games against Gonzaga (Jan. 31 and Feb. 28) in their final meetings as WCC foes before Gonzaga leaves for the reforming Pac 12.\nStanford highlights ACC's resurgenceOne year after placing just four of its 18 teams in the NCAA Tournament field, the ACC is enjoying a significant resurgence. Entering the weekend, nine ACC teams are in the field, according to the CBS Sports Bracketology model. Another two — Virginia Tech and Syracuse — aren't far behind. Strong debut campaigns for new coaches Jai Lucas (Miami), Will Wade (NC State) and Ryan Odom (Virginia) have helped breathe new life into the conference.But no one has been more surprising than Stanford. Picked to finish 17th in the league's preseason poll, the Cardinal (14-4, 3-2 ACC) are up to 4-1 in Quad 1 after upsetting North Carolina 95-90 on Wednesday. Now comes another showcase opportunity on Saturday against Duke in a battle between two of the nation's most exciting freshmen. \nThree-star guard Ebuka Okorie is leading the ACC in scoring at 22.9 points for Stanford and just torched UNC for 36 points. But the Cardinal will have their hands full against a Duke team led by five-star phenom Cam Boozer. The bruising forward has led the Blue Devils to a 16-1 (5-0) start and a spot on the No. 1 seed line in CBS Sports Bracketology.\n            ",

It was Gonzaga. And, as you possibly already know, the Zags played without Braden Huff, their second-leading scorer, because, earlier in the day, the school announced he'll be sidelined for four-to-eight weeks with a left knee injury suffered in a recent practice.Big blow, obviously.\"We didn't have much time to feel sorry for ourselves,\" Gonzaga coach Mark Few said following his team's 86-65 win at Washington State. \"That's something that I'm very, very proud of this group. It was a really, really, really great win for us; go on the road, play a team that was playing some of the best basketball they played this year. And to do it without not only one of our best players, one of the best players in the league, one of the best players out West, I think one of the better players in the country, so that's a lot to have to absorb in 24 hours. The guys were great, absolutely great.\"The Zags are at least 25 spots better at KenPom.com than everybody else in the West Coast Conference, at least 43 spots better than everybody other than Saint Mary's, and at least 95 spots better than everybody other than Saint Mary's and San Francisco. In other words, Huff's injury likely won't impact Gonzaga's record much, if at all. But, again, the stated timeline from school officials is four-to-eight weeks, and eight weeks from Wednesday is March 12.The WCC title game is March 10. Selection Sunday is March 15.No coach with a team good enough to win a national championship, as Gonzaga clearly is, wants to have to reacclimate a big piece -- Huff is averaging 17.8 points and 5.6 rebounds in 25.4 minutes per contest -- to the rotation heading into a single-elimination tournament. It's not impossible, but it can be challenging. So here's hoping Huff's return is closer to four weeks than eight, that way he'll have a string of games to get comfortable again before the Zags participate in what will be a 27th straight NCAA Tournament.\nGonzaga is No. 8 in Friday morning's updated CBS Sports Top 25 And 1 daily college basketball rankings, where Arizona remains No. 1 for the fifth consecutive day.

    "body": "\n        The results of the 2026 Baseball Hall of Fame vote will be revealed in just a few days. CBS Sports has two BBWAA members who are Hall of Fame voters in Matt Snyder and Mike Axisa. Both have broken down their decisions, so we thought we'd use the differences to dive deeper into this year's ballot.Let's get to it.Matt Snyder: We might as well dig in right away. You voted for Alex Rodríguez and Manny Ramírez while I didn't. I remain open to changing my mind in future years -- though I don't think I will -- but my stance is that players suspended for PED violations once there was a Joint Drug Agreement in place won't get my vote. If there's no suspension, I just vote based on playing history. I know it's a tough needle to thread for some, but I figured long ago I needed a line and this is where I've ended up. Mike Axisa: Yeah, I get that. You have to draw a line somewhere and the start of the testing era is about as good a line as there is. I'm just of the opinion that players have cheated forever and will cheat forever, and the players who get caught cheating get punished by the league. In the case of PEDs, the punishment is collectively bargained. The union agreed to the suspensions (and continues to push for longer suspensions). Manny failed tests (twice) and got suspended (twice). A-Rod admitted his use and served the longest PED suspension in MLB history. I don't like speculating about who did and who didn't use, and here we know Manny and A-Rod did it. The way I see it, Ramirez and Rodriguez were punished in accordance with the rules and served their suspensions, so I consider it case closed. I don't believe in punishing them further by withholding my Hall of Fame vote. I'm certain you agree they both had Hall of Fame-worthy careers, and I don't think PEDs are the reason they were good. Manny and A-Rod are two of the best hitters ever (A-Rod's one of the best all-around players ever). They were two of the most important players of their era and more than clear the \"fame\" bar. They were punished per the rules and I think that's that.\n        \n            \n                Matt Snyder's 2026 Baseball Hall of Fame ballot\n                \n                    Matt Snyder                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSnyder: Do you view Carlos Beltrán as being in a similar ballpark as the PED guys? I don't really have a great answer other than it just feels different to me. First off, he was never suspended by the league -- my main thing on the PED guys is they cost their teams in a big way with the lengthy suspensions --  and a team-wide operation feels like trying to win instead of a player putting himself above the team. Am I off base here? Is it similar?\nAxisa: At the end of the day, it's still cheating. Beltrán's Astros just cheated in a different way than the PED guys. And similar to my opinion with Manny and A-Rod, Beltrán was punished by the league, so I think it's been dealt with. Now, in this case Beltrán wasn't actually punished. No Astros players were suspended (Beltrán had already retired by time the sign-stealing scandal came to light, though he could've been put on the ineligible list like A.J. Hinch and Jeff Luhnow), which I think was a bad mistake by Rob Manfred, but if the league deemed no discipline was appropriate, then that's enough for me. Yes, I lump Beltrán in with Manny and A-Rod because they're all cheaters, so I'm treating them the same.Snyder: The other differences in our ballots are that I voted for Dustin Pedroia and Jimmy Rollins, basically in the A-Rod/Manny spots. Would you have voted for both if you had room?Axisa: Yes on Pedroia, no on Rollins. Rollins was a really good player for a really long time, though he falls short of the Hall of Fame for me. He played 15 full seasons from 2001-15 and had a 100 OPS+ or higher only five times. His defense was very good more than best in the league and that's not enough to carry the bat, even with 470 steals. Great player who was a centerpiece on some very good Phillies teams, but short of Cooperstown worthy for me.As for Pedroia, I'm not 100% convinced he's a Hall of Famer, but I'm also not convinced he's not a Hall of Famer, if that makes sense. If I had room on my ballot, I would have voted for Pedroia just to help keep him on the ballot another year so I could consider him further. He's similar to Andruw Jones in that he was basically done by age 31, though Jones had a much higher peak, so he got my vote over Pedroia. I'm a \"big Hall\" guy and my guess is Pedroia is more likely to get my vote down the line than not, but I'm not ready to say that for certain yet.\n\n        \n            \n                Mike Axisa's 2026 Baseball Hall of Fame ballot\n                \n                    Mike Axisa                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSnyder: I'm glad you mentioned the \"not 100% convinced\" thing. That's how I feel for a decent number of players on the ballot. I've gotten to the point that if I think a player is really close to being a Hall of Famer, I'm just going to vote for him and if he somehow gets to 75%, well, there were a lot of people supporting the Hall case. I'd rather be part of the reason a player makes the Hall of Fame than part of the reason he doesn't. We totally agree on Pedroia. On Rollins, I felt like he was a \"heart-and-soul\" guy and was one of the greatest leadoff men ever.I understand why people don't vote for Rollins. I get it. Same with Pedroia. While we're here, my toughest omission was David Wright (another one in this boat for me with Rollins and Pedroia; I just ran out of room on my ballot). Do you feel the same? Axisa: I have Wright in the same bucket as Pedroia. I'm not sure he's a Hall of Famer but I would've given him a vote (if I had one) to keep him on the ballot, so I could consider him more in the future. (Pedroia and Wright are both on pace to easily clear the 5% needed to stay on the ballot as I write this.) I'm not sure who my toughest omission was. It really was Pedroia and Wright together. It's hard for me to put one ahead of the other right now. Their careers were so, so similar.\nSnyder: I have a feeling that if we get much pushback here, it might come on the starting pitchers, Mark Buehrle, Cole Hamels, Andy Pettitte and Félix Hernández. Are we dipping down too low on the SP here? Axisa: I don't think so. These four were among the very best pitchers of their era, an era in which pitchers just aren't going to get to 300 wins or 4,000 strikeouts (moreso when Félix and Hamels played than Buehrle and Pettitte), and we shouldn't hold them to the historical standard for starters. I will say that these four are right at the line for what I would consider a Hall of Famer. I don't expect to go much lower than this. Did I think Buehrle was a Hall of Famer during his career? No, I can't say I did, but the overall body of work is so good. Same with the other guys. Hernández had the \"best in the league\" peak, Pettitte the absurd longevity, and Hamels a bit of both. Hamels is my No. 1 pitcher on the ballot. If I could only vote for one of these guys, it would be him over Hernández, Pettitte, and Buehrle.Snyder: I totally agree.\n            ",

It's an especially happy Friday if you're a Dodgers fan and an even better one if you're Kyle Tucker's bank account. I, for one, wish I had an extra $240 million lying around. It's Carter Bahns behind the keyboard today with a rundown of the biggest storylines in sports entering the weekend, and there is nowhere else to start but with the biggest free agency deal of the baseball offseason. But before we move on with our day, we'll also look ahead at the divisional round of the NFL playoffs, preview the Australian Open and discuss a whole lot of news on the basketball court. Let's go.  ⚾ Five things to know Friday Kyle Tucker will reportedly sign with the Dodgers. There it is: the biggest move of the hot stove season. Tucker, CBS Sports' top-ranked free agent, is set to join the defending two-time World Series champions as a massive addition to the Los Angeles outfield -- one who posted at least 4.6 Wins Above Replacement each of the last five seasons. It is reportedly a four-year, $240 million deal for Tucker, whom the Blue Jays and Mets also courted down to the wire. The $60 million average annual value makes Tucker the highest-paid player in MLB history after deferrals and sets the Dodgers up for a $416.4 million projected payroll. The Cubs will receive a compensatory pick in the draft because Tucker did not accept their qualifying offer and instead signed with another team.Federal prosecutors charged 26 people, including college basketball players, in an alleged point-shaving scheme. The indictment lists 17 former college basketball players as defendants in one of the largest gambling conspiracies in college sports history.

    "body": "\n        Back like it never left, another MLS season is right around the corner after Inter Miami lifted the first MLS Cup in their history in December and will now look to back it up with another one. But with teams around the league improving and a break for the FIFA World Cup in the middle of the season, defending the crown will be no easy task. The addition of Mexican striker German Berterame has improved the squad, but other teams in the Eastern Conference, such as Nashville SC and Orlando City SC, have also made moves to come within striking distance of the Herons.Ahead of the season is always a good time to take a look at who will win the league awards, even if MLS may be one of the most unpredictable leagues in the world, while also taking some fun looks into the crystal ball. So let's get to it:Most Valuable Player - Lionel Messi (Inter Miami CF)Lionel Messi is going for the three-peat as MVP after already becoming the first player in league history to win the award in back-to-back seasons. On one hand, it may feel as if this award has gotten boring since Messi also came close to winning it in only a half-season of play when he first joined the Herons, but no player in the league is coming close to the Argentine's production with Inter Miami. With German Berterame joining from Monterrey, Messi will also have a new partner in attack, and they've shown some chemistry in preseason play. Until proven otherwise, this award is Messi's to lose, and while some like Heung-min Son and Anders Dreyer will do the best they can to take it away from him, if the Messi that has shown up for Miami so far does what's expected in a World Cup year, look out.Seriously, Messi is one of one.\n                                                                    CBS Sports\n                                                            Golden Boot: German Berterame (Inter Miami CF)I don't love taking newcomers for Golden Boot due to needing to fit into a team and learning a new league, but thanks to Concacaf Champions Cup and Leagues Cup, Berterame doesn't have as much of a learning curve as someone coming from abroad due to playing against MLS teams on a regular basis. Scoring 13 goals and assisting three more with Monterrey before departing, Berterame will thrive with the service from Messi, which can make his +2700 odds to win it seem like a bargain. He'll have competition from Messi as well as Sam Surridge and Son in what will be a serious race for the league's top scorer, but the stage is set to succeed.\nMLS Cup champions: Inter Miami CFLike the MVP award, we've got Inter Miami going back-to-back as MLS Cup champions. Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba may have retired, but in adding Dayne St. Clair from Minnesota United, the defense will improve in the long run. There's also the addition of Sergio Reguillon, which will add dynamism going both ways at left back, and the newness of opening a new stadium, Miami Freedom Park, will only add more energy to help the Herons reach their goal of defending the first MLS Cup title in club history. They'll have opposition, but through Messi, all things are possible.Best signing: Cristian Espinoza (Nashville SC)While a strange set of circumstances led Espinoza to Nashville, his Concacaf Champions Cup debut has already shown a small glimpse of what they'll be getting. Immediately after entering the match, Hany Mukhtar, Surridge, and Espinoza all combined for a quickfire goal for Nashville. We'll be seeing quite a lot of that as Espinoza has been one of the best creators in all of MLS despite playing for a struggling Earthquakes side. B.J. Callaghan has already raised expectations in Nashville, and now having a true third option in attack will help his side reach them as this is an improved side that will make things happen. The days may be behind us of Nashville being a defensive side who are grinding out matches; they're able to take games on their terms.\n                                                                    CBS Sports\n                                                            Worst signing: Timo Werner (San Jose Earthquakes)It may have been a free transfer that brought Timo Werner from RB Leipzig, but when San Jose are replacing Josef Martinez and Cristian Arango with a striker who has scored a total of four goals in the last four seasons is a clear downgrade. The one benefit is that Werner has fresh legs from his lack of playing time over the years, and his speed could give him space when faced against MLS defenses, but it's hard to see this working out. D.C. United get an honorable mention in spending to bring Louis Munteanu from CFR Cluj in Romania, but on potential, he's only 23 and can be molded, while Werner is firmly in his prime age-wise with plenty to prove.\nTeam to watch: Nashville SC After lifting the first trophy in club history by winning the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup in 2025, this season is a time to push for more. Nashville will take part in the Leagues Cup, Concacaf Champions Cup, and MLS play, and with an improved roster, they'll be able to compete on all fronts. In the Eastern Conference, Nashville are the team who have the best chance of knocking out Miami on the way to MLS Cup.MLS Newcomer of the Year: Iago (Orlando City SC CB from Flamengo)One of the most talented young defenders in Brazil, Iago, joining from Flamengo, will be set to anchor Orlando's defense. A member of the Brazil youth national teams, he brings extensive experience to MLS despite only being 20. Oscar Pareja has been one of the best around at improving the performance of young players, and in a quick period, Iago will be able to shine as a defender in MLS. Even if he doesn't net MLS Newcomer of the Year, Iago will be in the running for being the young player of the year, topping the 22 Under 22 list.Supporters' Shield Winners: Orlando City SCTo win the Supporters' Shield, it takes a mix of circumstances, and like the Philadelphia Union last season, Orlando City SC not taking part in the Concacaf Champions Cup will give them more room to rotate and keep their squad fresh for MLS matches. Losing Alex Freeman to Villarreal is quite a loss, but in adding Griffin Dorese, they'll have enough to get by, considering the improvements elsewhere in the roster. There was a serious effort to add from the Brazilian Serie A, with Luis Otavio and Tiago also joining, so Oscar Pareja has a talented roster that can push to win the east.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Chicago Bears have played at Soldier Field for over 50 years, but have been looking for a location to build a new domed stadium and a site in Indiana is becoming a real possibility. The Indiana House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee passed a crucial bill Thursday in an effort to move forward in getting the stadium built. The bill is for establishing a Northwest Indiana Stadium Authority to finance, construct and lease a stadium and was passed with a 24-0 vote.\"The passage of [the bill] would mark the most meaningful step forward in our stadium planning efforts to date,\" the Bears said in a statement, via the Associated Press. \"We are committed to finishing the remaining site-specific necessary due diligence to support our vision to build a world-class stadium near the Wolf Lake area in Hammond, Indiana.\"The Illinois House Revenue and Finance Committee was set to hold a hearing Thursday for a bill allowing the Bears to negotiate long-term property tax rates with local governing bodies, but it was canceled. \n\"Illinois was ready to move this bill forward. After a productive three-hour meeting yesterday, the Bears leaders requested the [Illinois General Assembly] pause the hearing to make further tweaks to the bill,\" Matt Hill, a spokesperson for Illinois Governor JB Pritzker said. \"This morning, we were surprised to see a statement lauding Indiana and ignoring Illinois.\"\n        \n            \n                The Chicago Bears playing in Indiana? Team says it's expanding search for new stadium site beyond Illinois\n                \n                    Shakiel Mahjouri                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Bears first looked into building a stadium in Arlington Heights, Illinois, a northwest Chicago suburb, with the team purchasing the land in 2023. In December, Bears president Kevin Warren said state leaders informed him that the project was not a priority for 2026.Meanwhile, Indiana Governor Mike Braun has been lobbying for the team to controversially move across state lines. Playing in a different state than a team name suggests is nothing new for NFL teams as the New York Jets and New York Giants both play in New Jersey. Soldier Field is about 15 minutes from the Indiana-Illinois state line. \nThe journey to get a new stadium has gone on for years and the team has hit numerous road blocks. In September 2022, the Bears revealed a plan for Arlington Heights including restaurants, shops and more, costing almost $5 billion. Warren's goal was to have the Arlington Heights construction plans in September so they could put in a bid for the Super Bowl by 2031.The team is looking for $855 million in public funding for infrastructure to build in Arlington Heights, according to a team consultant report from last September. The Bears also sought for the Illinois legislature to pass a bill freezing property taxes for large-scale construction projects, which would've allowed them to begin building in 2025, but none of their requests were granted. The team announced in December that they were expanding their search to outside Illinois, saying the new stadium is not just for the fans, but would bring jobs and revenue for the state. \n\"Consequently, in addition to Arlington Park, we need to expand our search and critically evaluate opportunities throughout the wider Chicagoland region, including Northwest Indiana,\" a letter to fans from Warren read. \"This is not about leverage. We spent years trying to build a new home in Cook County. We invested significant time and resources evaluating multiple sites and rationally decided on Arlington Heights. Our fans deserve a world-class stadium. Our players and coaches deserve a venue that matches the championship standard they strive for every day. With that in mind, our organization must keep every credible pathway open to deliver that future.\"Since making the move to Chicago in 1921, the Bears have played at Wrigley Field and Soldier Field and the team has never owned the stadium they call home. They're hoping to change that and looking in multiple states to do so. \n            ",

He has been working towards getting back to full strength after he suffered a season-ending foot injury 10 games into the 2025 season. With Johnson on the mend during the second half of the season, the Eagles still won the NFC East but were quickly ousted by the San Francisco 49ers in the Wild Card Round. Johnson's injury was part of what was a trying season for the Eagles, who struggled to capture the momentum that they found during their 2024 Super Bowl run. Specifically, it was a rough year for an offense that boasts some of the league's top skill players in running back Saquon Barkley, quarterback Jalen Hurts and wideouts A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith. \nThe Eagles finished the season just 19th in the NFL in scoring, 23rd in passing and 24th on third down. Those issues compelled coach Nick Sirianni to change offensive coordinators this season while hiring former Green Bay Packers quarterbacks coach Sean Mannion to replace Kevin Patullo, who has resurfaced as the Miami Dolphins' new passing game coordinator. Philadelphia's offensive line has also undergone a coaching change after Jeff Stoutland resigned this offseason after 13 years in that role. He will be replaced by Chris Kuper, a former Denver Broncos offensive lineman who served as the Minnesota Vikings' offensive line coach from 2022-25. The return of Johnson will bring a level of stability to an Eagles offense that is hoping to bounce back in 2026. The fourth overall pick in the 2013 NFL Draft, Johnson has carved out a career in Philadelphia that will undoubtedly receive Hall of Fame consideration whenever he is eligible for enshrinement.\nA six-time Pro Bowler and two-time All-Pro, Johnson's career highlights include being a key member on the Eagles' Super Bowl-winning teams in 2017 and 2024. During Philadelphia's second Super Bowl championship run, Johnson helped Barkley become the ninth player in league history for run for over 2,000 yards during the regular season. Barkley then broke Terrell Davis' record for rushing yards for an entire season. \n            \n",

    "body": "\n        There is no questioning the ability of Kansas guard Darryn Peterson, whom many believe is the frontrunner to be the No. 1 pick in the 2026 NBA Draft. But there are -- and will continue to be after yet another early exit Wednesday in an 81-69 victory over Oklahoma State, in which he did not appear in the game's final 17.5 minutes -- questions about his availability, which now linger as the biggest hindrance to KU's national title hopes.It's not just that he has played in 15 of KU's 26 games this season, owing to quad cramping, a hamstring strain and an ankle injury. It's that of those 15 appearances, he has now also left early in three games -- BYU, Iowa State and most recently the OSU game. He was also a stunning last-minute DNP last week vs. No. 1 Arizona due to flu-like symptoms despite participating in warm-ups. (Kansas won the game without him, 82-78.)Up until Wednesday, Peterson's various ailments and injuries were largely defensible, even if defending him seemed increasingly hard to do. The ankle injury looked significant enough to warrant a missed game. The hamstring injury was absolutely legit, KU coach Bill Self emphatically said earlier last week. And let's extend some grace and say the flu-like symptoms were bad enough to miss a home game vs. the No. 1 team. Fine.Peterson tapping himself out Wednesday vs. Oklahoma State and checking out with 17:22 remaining -- and never seeing the floor again -- reached the point of indefensible. Postgame, even Self seemed like he was fed up trying to fend off detractors. \n\"I didn't anticipate that tonight at all,\" Self said, noting that Peterson tapping out for games has happened more than a couple of times at this point. \"I thought he was good to go. But, obviously, we only got 18 minutes out of him.\"Self said squeezing 18 minutes out of Peterson was \"disappointing,\" because, well, duh; he is a spectacular, game-changing talent when available. He finished the game with a team-high 23 points despite playing the sixth-most minutes of the eight Jayhawks who appeared in the game. But it is also disappointing because Peterson's availability, or lack thereof, is undeniably obstructing the team's ability to have any semblance of continuity. It's hard to plan for the next half, much less the next game, when you don't know if your best player is going to have a cramping episode. (To say nothing, of course, about the inevitable distraction his saga has become.)\nSelf's positive takeaway from Peterson's extended absence to end the game laid bare the dire situation in which his best player has stuck him. The only good thing about Peterson being unavailable, Self said postgame, was that KU's roster has gotten used to the will-he-or-won't-he play sideshow. \"One thing about it is that it's happened often enough that our guys have learned to play without him, even though that's not the way we want to play.\" Self said. \"But that's certainly something that we're not unaccustomed to right now.\"That's not only a sub-optimal situation for Self and his staff, but all of this also feels unsustainable. You have a superstar player checking out of games unexpectedly, and -- fair or not -- appearing to quit on his team. Self juggling this without a full-blown locker room mutiny is but a minor miracle. \nSelf said after the game Peterson was going to come out regardless of whether he buried the 3-pointer with just over 17:30 remaining in the second half. He also said he was wholly unaware that he was going to be done for the night. Even for a Hall of Fame coach in Self, this feels like an inflection point. Compare it with the situation in the SEC across the country Wednesday, where Arkansas guard Darius Acuff scored 49 points and played a team-high 50 minutes despite wearing a walking boot in the two days leading up to the game, and it's hard to come to any conclusion other than Peterson is more interested in protecting his draft stock than playing for his team.But what is Self's recourse here, really? There are five regular-season games and KU is in the Big 12 title hunt. Sit him, and you risk losing Peterson. Whose to say he wouldn't just shut himself down? Play him, though, and you might continue inviting the circus into your own locker room. He's been productive, to be clear, but the numbers also suggest KU might be better off just rolling with the players who clearly want to play.\nDarryn PetersonOn courtOff courtDifferenceTotal net rating14.413.3+1.1Offensive net rating116.1114.3+1.8Defensive net rating 101.7101.0+0.6If Peterson's inability to finish vs. BYU on Jan. 31 was a red flag, his 24 minutes Saturday vs. Iowa State simply elevated the alarm bells, though Self said the ISU game curtain call was his own doing. Eighteen minutes Wednesday vs. OSU -- and tapping out with 17:22 remaining -- is a five-alarm fire that can no longer be ignored.\"I thought we were past it, but obviously we're not,\" Self said. \"It's certainly a concern. You get into the NCAA Tournament and you're playing a team just as good as you, you need to have all your best players available. All it takes is for one day like that to derail not only a game, but a season. So yeah, it's concerning.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Tanking has been the hot button topic around the NBA, and team owners have now gotten in on the conversation. Phoenix Suns owner Mat Ishbia had some strong words on social media about the prospect of teams tanking around the league to better position themselves for one of the top draft prospects coming out of college.\"This is ridiculous! Tanking is losing behavior done by losers,\" Ishbia wrote on X. \"Purposely losing is something nobody should want to be associated with. Embarrassing for the league and for the organizations. And the talk about this as a 'strategy' is ridiculous.\"The topic of tanking was ever-present during All-Star weekend, with league commissioner Adam Silver saying during his annual press conference that the tanking has been \"worse\" this year compared to seasons past. \"Are we seeing behavior that is worse this year than we've seen in recent memory?\" Silver asked rhetorically. \"Yes, in my view. Which is what led to those fines. And not just the fines, but my statement that we're going to be looking more closely at the totality of all the circumstances this season in terms of teams' behavior and very intentionally wanted teams to be on notice.\"\n        \n            \n                Mark Cuban explains why NBA 'should embrace tanking,' prioritize fans in wake of Adam Silver's remarks\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSilver handed down a hefty $500,000 fine to the Utah Jazz for holding out players in the fourth quarter in close games in an effort to lose games. A $100,000 fine was also given to the Indiana Pacers for holding healthy players out of games entirely. \nThe fine given to the Jazz was among the largest we've ever seen, and was clearly supposed to serve as a message to the rest of the league about their tanking tactics. Will it change things? Probably not. But Ishbia thinks \"massive changes\" need to happen to curb this behavior.\"If you are a bad team, you get a good pick,\" Ishbia wrote on social media. \"That makes sense. But purposely shutting down players and purposely losing games is a disgrace and impacts the integrity of whole league.   This is much worse than any prop bet scandal. This is throwing games strategically. Horrible for fans that pay to watch and cheer on their team. And horrible for all the real teams that are competing for playoff spots.\"\"Awful behavior that Adam Silver and the NBA will need to stop with massive changes, and I have complete confidence that with his leadership, he will fix it. Those of us in a position of influence need to speak out… the only \"strategy\" is doing right by fans, players, and the NBA community.\"Ishbia didn't offer any options for what should be done to stop this blatant tanking, but his thoughts are in direct opposition to what Dallas Mavericks minority owner Mark Cuban thinks on the topic. Cuban also took to social media recently to say that the NBA should \"embrace tanking,\" as it's one of the proven ways for teams to improve their championship hopes. That's especially true of small market teams -- like the Jazz -- who will never be able to outpace teams like the Los Angeles Lakers or New York Knicks in trying to sign top-tier free agents simply because the team exists in Utah and not a market like Los Angeles or New York.We'll see if the league tries to make any meaningful changes to limit tanking, but it's been an unsolvable problem for years now. And in a year where the draft is loaded with elite talent, of course every team is going to prioritize their draft positioning over getting the No. 8 spot in the playoffs just to get swept. It's a situation the league created by awarding the worst team with the top pick in the past and then flattening the odds to allow several teams a more equal shot at landing that top pick.\nSo unless there's drastic, sweeping changes, tanking isn't going anywhere.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        We're less than a month away from Selection Sunday and the more we see, the more convinced we are that the 2026 NBA Draft class could be something special.Our latest big board reflects plenty of movement, beyond the top four. To be clear though, the debate is intensifying at the top of the draft as well. Darryn Peterson remains at the top spot, as he has all season long, but the ongoing availability saga continues to add questions. The bottom line is that when he's been on the floor and not limited, he's been even better than expected. Unfortunately though, the times when he's been out of the line-up, or noticeably tentative even when he is playing, continue to mount. While most NBA executives still seem to favor him atop the draft, this ongoing trend is creating some pause. Availability is vital in today's NBA, particular when a franchise is committing to build around you long-term. Peterson's season has left executives to question his physical durability, along with any other factors that could be contributing to this very clear pattern.\n        \n            \n                Darryn Peterson's latest exit borders on indefensible as star proves hindrance to Kansas' national title hopes\n                \n                    Kyle Boone                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDybantsa impressive, but questions remainWhile questions are intensifying about Peterson, AJ Dybantsa is putting up unmatched offensive numbers. He's the leading scorer in Division I at 24.8 points per game, making real gains with his ability to pressure the rim, finish through contact and still maintain his core competencies of being able to get to the free-throw line and rise-and-fire in the mid-range area. However, there are questions about him too. BYU has built their attack around Dybantsa and yet they've lost six of their last nine. \nCertainly, the loss of Richie Saunders is a huge one, but they had lost five of six from mid-January through early-February without him. Dybantsa's defensive intensity, body language and rebounding have, at times, come in correlation to his team's success. So, questions from high school about whether or not someone with his natural talent impacts winning, are now resurfacing.Boozer shows he's a winnerThen, there's Cameron Boozer. His individual offense isn't nearly as flashy as Peterson or Dybantsa. His highest levels outcomes may not have the same ceiling, but his impact on winning is as undeniable at Duke as it was in high school. We're talking about a player who won both state and Nike EYB championships every single year. He did the same thing every time he put on a USA Basketball jersey. Then he punctuated all that with a national championship as a high school senior. At Duke, he's been the focal point of a team that is now 24-2, without nearly the same supporting cast as Cooper Flagg had a year ago. He's the favorite to win national player of the year and proven to be the most reliable of the big three prospects. So I, and perhaps some NBA executives, are starting to wonder if he should be getting more consideration atop this draft.\nFreshmen class shows it is eliteWhile the big three still headline this draft, the freshmen class is proving that they are, collectively, truly elite in totality. Caleb Wilson had been tremendous for North Carolina prior to his recent injury and is on the verge of putting himself in the conversation for a top three pick. Kingston Flemings has sustained the same signs of stardom he showed to start the season, while Keaton Wagler has blown away expectations by a consistently increasing margin as the season has gone on. Simultaneously, Darius Acuff has been absolutely dominant for Arkansas and both Mikel Brown and Nate Ament have started to put the pieces together at Louisville and Tennessee respectively.From a positional standpoint, we're seeing some real depth emerge at both ends of the line-up. The freshmen headline what looks like the deepest point guard class in recent years with Peterson, Flemings, Wagler, Brown and Acuff all projected as top ten picks. But Bennett Stirtz and Labaron Philon could push for the lottery as well, while Christian Anderson looks like a very solid first-round pick.Interesting options at centerThe depth at the center position lacks the same star power, but boasts a variety of players who could fight for spots in the first-round and a host of others who will have to weigh certain NIL paydays versus the financial uncertainty that comes from being a fringe first-round pick, given that second-round picks do not necessarily receive guaranteed contracts. \nJayden Quaintance is still the most intriguing true big man, but after that, beauty may truly be in the eye of the beholder. Henri Veesaar, Flory Bidunga, Patrick Ngongba, Motiejus Krivas, Rueben Chinyelu, Aday Mara and Morez Johnson all have a chance to be first-round picks and yet none of them is a lock to end up in that range. Simultaneously, they all have additional eligibility remaining in college, so who stays and who goes when it's all said and done will be a very compelling storyline to watch and ultimately dictate just how good this big man market ends up being.Of course, with all eyes on college basketball as we approach March Madness, the storylines of are just beginning to reveal themselves. What we know for sure is that there is a ton of anticipation behind this draft and the vast majority of them will be on display in the NCAA Tournament. NBA Draft Big Board top 10Top 10 players on CBS Sports NBA Draft expert Adam Finkelstein's Prospects Rankings.

    "body": "\n        In addition to Tyreek Hill and Bradley Chubb, the Miami Dolphins' roster purge may also include safety Minkah Fitzpatrick, as Miami has reportedly had talks with other teams about a possible trade involving the former All-Pro safety. A former Dolphins first-round pick, Fitzpatrick was traded back to Miami last year following a highly productive six-year run with the Pittsburgh Steelers. During his time in Pittsburgh, Fitzpatrick earned five Pro Bowl and three All-Pro nods while becoming one of the league's top safeties. \n        \n            \n                What's next for Dolphins after Tyreek Hill, Bradley Chubb releases? Tua Tagovailoa's future, new roster moves\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nVersatility became one of Fitzpatrick's main calling cards in Pittsburgh. After being a turnover machine during his first two seasons with the Steelers, circumstances outside of his control forced Fitzpatrick to be used more as a run-stuffer in 2021. Fitzpatrick embraced his new role, which led to a career-high 124 tackles, two interceptions, a forced fumble and a recovered fumble. In 2022, he earned his first of three straight Pro Bowl nods after leading the league with six interceptions. Last season, he filled the stat sheet with 82 tackles, one sack, two fumble recoveries, a forced fumble and an interception for defensive coordinator Anthony Weaver, who is now in that same role with the Baltimore Ravens. \nHere are several logical landing spots should the Dolphins decide to either trade or release Fitzpatrick, who has one year remaining on his current contract. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Patriots New England may be in the market for a new free safety if Jaylinn Hawkins signs with someone else when free agency begins next month. In Fitzpatrick, the defending AFC champions would be getting a talented defender who could complement cornerback Christian Gonzalez and cornerback Craig Woodson. Another benefit here is that Fitzpatrick is familiar with inside linebacker Robert Spillane stemming from their years together in Pittsburgh. \nNew England's defense was largely exceptional last year, but one area where they struggled at times was in the red zone (they ranked 30th in the league in that area during the regular season). This is where Fitzpatrick's ability as a ballhawk and run-stuffer could really come in handy. The big question here is whether the Dolphins would be willing to trade Fitzpatrick to a divisional foe. They probably wouldn't unless the Patriots made them an offer they couldn't refuse. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Cowboys Dallas is an obvious possible landing spot for Fitzpatrick, given how bad the Cowboys were on defense last year and Jerry Jones' compulsive behavior when it comes to making headlines. Adding to this possibility are rumblings that free safety Malik Harrison could become a salary cap casualty. \nIf they were to acquire Fitzpatrick, the Cowboys would simultaneously improve their run and pass defenses. It may also benefit George Pickens, who had several notable practice battles with Fitzpatrick during their time together in Pittsburgh. The Cowboys make even more sense given new defensive coordinator Christian Parker's implementation of the 3-4, an alignment in which Fitzpatrick flourished during his time with the Steelers.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    49ersIn this scenario, Fitzpatrick would get a chance to play with new 49ers defensive coordinator Raheem Morris, who has coached several talented safeties during his career, most recently Atlanta's Jessie Bates III. \nWhile injuries may have been the 49ers' biggest Achilles heel in 2025, their pass defense was a major issue as well. During the regular season, San Francisco was 25th in the NFL in pass defense, 21st in touchdown passes allowed and 29th in interceptions forced. Fitzpatrick's arrival would help improve those numbers while making the 49ers better equipped to deal with divisional foes Matthew Stafford, Sam Darnold and Kyler Murray. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    RamsIt's conceivable to think that Fitzpatrick would be the difference in helping the Rams leapfrog the newly crowned champion Seattle Seahawks as the NFL's best team. Seattle lost its first game against Los Angeles last year before winning its last two games on the strength of some clutch passes from Darnold. While they have some talented defensive backs, the Rams lack speed and experience in that area. Fitzpatrick would fill both of those voids while giving defensive coordinator Chris Shula another proven commodity alongside emerging stars Jared Verse, Byron Young, Kamren Curl and Quentin Lake. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    SteelersIn Pittsburgh, Fitzpatrick would not only be reunited with Cameron Heyward and T.J. Watt, but he would also get the chance to play alongside Jalen Ramsey, who came to Pittsburgh last summer as part of the trade that sent Fitzpatrick to Miami. The thought then was that Ramsey would help fill Fitzpatrick's void at safety, but that plan fell through after injuries decimated the Steelers' secondary. If Fitzpatrick returned to Pittsburgh, that would give the Steelers -- on paper -- a pretty formidable defensive backfield that would also include veteran safety DeShon Elliott (who is returning from a season-ending injury) and cornerback Joey Porter Jr., who is coming off his best season to date. A major roadblock in this scenario is that NFL teams cannot trade a player back to his previous team within two years of that trade. That means that the Steelers could only acquire Fitzpatrick if he is released by the Dolphins, which appears unlikely. \nBears/Vikings/Lions These teams were lumped together because each one needs help at safety despite already having established veterans in place. The Bears have Kevin Byard, who led the NFL last season with seven interceptions. The Vikings momentarily still have 37-year-old Harrison Smith, who is set to become a free agent next month. The Lions have former All-Pro Kerby Joseph, who is coming off a knee injury that cut his 2025 season short after six games. Of these teams, the Vikings make the most sense given Smith's age and his impending free agency. Commanders/JetsThese teams are combined because they are also in similar positions. While both teams are in desperate need of help in their defensive backfields, they are coming off dreadful 2025 seasons. Would Fitzpatrick agree to be traded to a bad team at this stage of his career? If he were, he'd likely be more inclined to go to Washington as the Commanders are just two years removed from an NFC title game appearance. They also have a proven defensive-minded head coach in Dan Quinn. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NBA All-Star break is over. Action returns Thursday night with a 10-game slate. Every team has between 26 and 29 games remaining. So let's to lock back in and refocus on the second \"half\" of the NBA season. Some teams have already sent out messages like bat signals to show how they're going to approach the last two months of the regular season.The Sacramento Kings announced that both Domantas Sabonis and Zach LaVine will have season-ending surgery. It's a move that very clearly states the Kings will be tanking the rest of the season to prioritize draft positioning. The Dallas Mavericks did a similar move, announcing Kyrie Irving will not play this season as he continues to rehab from a torn ACL he suffered in March 2025. While that's happening at the bottom of the standings, we could be in store for some compelling finishes at the top of the standings with several teams within a few games of each other in both the East and West. As we resume the regular season, let's take a look at the biggest storylines post-All-Star break.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Jayson Tatum's potential return to the Celtics  When Tatum tore his Achilles in May 2025, it appeared the Celtics would take a gap year with their superstar sidelined. It seemed highly possible that Tatum would be out the entirety of the 2025-26 season, and that Boston would refocus its efforts around the 2026-27 campaign.  \nBut here we are nine months from Tatum's Achilles surgery, and there are hints that he could make a return in the coming weeks. The All-Star forward practiced with Boston's G League squad before the All-Star break, and took part in 5-on-5 scrimmages with Celtics teammates and coaches. Everything is lining up toward a potential return ahead of the playoffs.Boston owns a 35-19 record, and sits second in the East. There's a world in which the Celtics could make a deep run in the postseason without Tatum. Having Tatum healthy should only strengthen Boston's postseason hopes, and shake things up considerably in the East.  The race for the East couldn't be more wide open at the All-Star break. The Cavs are considered the favorites with +350 odds on FanDuel. The Celtics, Pistons and Knicks all have +370 odds.\nThe version we get of Tatum will greatly impact Boston's outlook for the rest of the season. If he comes back close to his All-NBA self, then every other team in the East should be worried about matching up with the Celtics in the postseason. -- Jasmyn Wimbish\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. How seriously do we take the Knicks?I don't think anyone knows exactly what to make of the Knicks, who entered the All-Star break having won 10 of their previous 12 but remain a defensively deficient team that will likely have to play the rest of the regular season without Miles McBride (who has been the lone Knick with a 100% approval rating this year).  Two big additions to watch: Jose Alvarado, obviously, and also Jeremy Sochan, who fell out of the rotation in San Antonio but could bring real defense and energy to a Knicks team that could use both if given any kind of opportunity.  \nWe're all waiting for Karl-Anthony Towns to find his range in what has been the worst shooting season of his career, but aside from McBride, Towns' plus-7.6 net rating is still the best mark on the team, per Cleaning the Glass. The defense is actually worse off with Jalen Brunson on the court sans Towns than vice versa.  Brunson, meanwhile, has been up and down of late himself. He's got two 40-pieces this month but his 43/31 shooting splits since Feb. 1 leave a lot to be desired. He went 4 for 20 and 0 for 8 from 3 in a 38-point loss to Detroit a couple weeks ago.  Nobody is questioning Brunson's offensive greatness, but it is a real question whether that's enough to make up for his own, and largely by extension New York's collective defensive ails, particularly if Towns doesn't get the shot going. All of these questions are happening in the context of what feels like the Knicks' best chance to make the Finals with this team. Can they seize it? These next six weeks won't tell us everything (anything can happen in the playoffs), but they will tell us a lot. -- Brad Botkin\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Can the Lakers secure a top-six seed?The Lakers sit 1 ½ games back of the Denver Nuggets for the No. 3 spot in the West. But they also sit just 1 ½ games ahead of the seventh-placed Phoenix Suns as the season resumes. Things are far from settled in the West. The Lakers are one of many West teams who could either host a first-round playoff series or have to earn their playoff spot through the Play-In Tournament.Having to go through the play-in isn't the end of the world, but when this team once sat second in the conference at the start of December, falling to seventh and having to potentially face Victor Wembanyama and the Spurs in the first round would not be ideal.The positive? Austin Reaves is back from a calf strain, and in the five games he's played since returning, the Lakers have gone 4-1. Having Reaves back is a night and day difference for the Lakers, who were relying far too much on Luka Dončić's offensive heroics and prime performances from a 41-year-old LeBron James. Reaves takes some of the offensive pressure of Doncic, gives the Lakers another guy who can create offensively and give you 20+ points a night. In just his second game back he had 35 points, showing that had it not been for the calf injury Reaves would've probably been a first-time All Star this season.\nThe have the eighth most difficult schedule over the rest of the season, but the Nuggets and the Timberwolves both have harder schedules, which could provide a nice path towards a top-four spot for L.A. -- Jasmyn Wimbish\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Can the Spurs jump the Thunder?Let's keep things in the Western Conference standings. San Antonio is my No. 1 team to watch down the stretch. The Spurs resume play Thursday night against the Suns having won six straight and 11 of their past 14 to sit three games back of the Thunder for the West's No. 1 seed. They have every right to believe they can catch and pass OKC. For starters, the Thunder, who have lost six of their past 11 and will be without Jalen Williams for the foreseeable future, have the second-toughest remaining schedule, per Tankathon. Besides that, the Spurs own the tiebreaker with a 4-1 head-to-head record. \nIf this happens, how are we not going to classify the Spurs as the title favorite? What other No. 1 seed who has defeated the defending champs four out of five times and won potentially north of 60 games would be considered anything less?The Spurs are starting to feel a little like the 2015 Warriors to me. The ascent is happening before everyone is ready to fully accept it. They were supposed to be a few years away from contention. This year was supposed to about maybe getting into the playoffs and getting some experience under their belt. But Victor Wembanyama, like Stephen Curry when he burst onto the scene, has rearranged the geometry of a basketball court to such a degree that no typical timeline can be applied. He's a force beyond anything we've ever seen, honestly, and the Spurs are stacked behind him with every marker of a top-tier contender. Perhaps the top contender. That still feels premature to say, but if they jump OKC for the top seed, I'm not sure how you could call them anything other than the title favorites. -- Brad Botkin\n5. Tanking wars at the bottom of the standingsThe talk of the NBA over the last two weeks has been about the league's tanking \"problem.\" The league fined the Utah Jazz $500,000 and the Indiana Pacers $100,000 for \"conduct detrimental to the league.\" The Jazz were fined for pulling players in the fourth quarter on two occasions despite being in closely-contested games. The Pacers held players out despite them being healthy. Both were obvious efforts by Utah and Indiana to tank, something that the league is seemingly trying to come down hard on.\"Overt behavior like this that prioritizes draft position over winning undermines the foundation of NBA competition and we will respond accordingly to any further actions that compromise the integrity of our games,\" NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in the league's statement.Since the league's punishment, there has been a lot of chatter about how to solve the league's tanking problem. Calls for eliminating the draft, setting lottery odds earlier in the season and holding a lottery tournament to determine who gets what pick have all been bandied about. But while everyone thinks they have the idea that's going to solve this issue for the league, teams will continue to tank.\n\n        \n            \n                How can the NBA stop tanking? Breaking down the internet's craziest solutions -- and why most would never work\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Wizards, Pacers, Nets, Kings, Jazz, Mavericks and Grizzlies have all essentially been eliminated from the postseason races already and want the best chance possible at the No. 1 pick. The Pacers and Jazz both could potentially lose their picks if they fall below certain slots.  One look at the collegiate basketball landscape this season and most front office executives are probably salivating over the prospect of landing Darryn Peterson, AJ Dybantsa, Cameron Boozer or a handful of other high-profile draft prospects. This is being billed as one of the best drafts in recent memory. Of course these teams want to do everything possible to try and land one of these guys. People might say tanking is bad for the league, but, for now, it's a necessary evil for teams to try and find generational talent. -- Jasmyn Wimbish\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Cavs, Harden primed for a run  Three games with James Harden, three wins with James Harden, who had four assists down the stretch and hit the game-tying 3 with under a minute to play in Cleveland's victory over Denver last week.\nCleveland started to find its sea legs after Christmas. They Cavs had won 13 of their previous 18 when the Harden deal went down. Everyone has been waiting for the team that won 64 games last season to emerge, and it feels safe to say that it has. But the question is: How much better can the Cavs be with Harden?  \"I understand that this team is going to be something special [with Harden],\" Donovan Mitchell wrote in his latest diary installment for Andscape. \"We're 3-0 so far, so we're not doing too bad. But I'm excited to see what we do when we get some practices under our belt, and we'll see what that looks like going forward.\" \t \tWe've already seen some of the best of what Harden will bring. He's carded 26 assists in his three games so far, which speaks to the playmaking burden he'll lift from the shoulders of Mitchell, the league's fifth-leading scorer who should be as free as he's been all season to, well, score.   It's largely the same tag-team dynamic that existed with Darius Garland, but Harden is a better creator than Garland and, importantly, he's healthy. The combined gravitational force of these two has already been on display.   Watch here as Harden has the ball on the wing with Mitchell in the short corner, and how the whole defense shifts their way as Jarrett Allen (with whom Harden has already looked very comfortable in two-man actions) cuts straight down the lane.   Possessions like this one below should become more of the norm, with Harden collapsing defenses and making life easier on Mitchell, who is making 40% of his catch-and-shoot 3s this season, per Synergy.   With the threat of Mitchell keeping defenses honest on one side and Allen rolling down the lane, the opposite side shooters should get a lot of looks like this as Harden is a master at waiting for defenses to commit before delivering.   Of course, this is the best of Harden. Time will tell if the worst of him -- his defense, namely, and some of his postseason disappearing acts -- will bite the Cavs when it counts most. But for now, Cleveland continuing to rise up the Eastern Conference standings (with the league's fifth-easiest remaining schedule, per Tankathon) looks like a pretty good bet. -- Brad Botkin\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Rookie of the Year race between Flagg and KnueppelThis is one of the most intriguing Rookie of the Year races in recent memory, even if the oddsmakers view Cooper Flagg as a heavy favorite with two months to go (-750 odds at FanDuel). Both Flagg and Kon Knueppel have valid cases to walk away with the award, and on any given night you could argue that one deserves it more. Flagg is shouldering the entirety of Dallas' offense and has been among the most efficient rookies given the types of shots he's taking. His defense is also years ahead of where rookies typically are, and he's already shown he can be the go-to guy in the clutch.  For Knueppel, he's the best shooting prospect we've seen since Stephen Curry, and he's completely elevated Charlotte's offense. He's benefiting from the brilliance of LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller, but he's much more than just a catch-and-shoot player. Knueppel's off-ball movement creates so many opportunities directly and indirectly, and he's about as automatic as it comes from 3-point land.  The first time these former teammates faced each other it was an absolute classic. Flagg had 49 points, while Knueppel had 34 points in the win. We'll get one more matchup between these two on March 3, and given how close this race is, perhaps it can help in figuring out who should come out on top for Rookie of the Year. -- Jasmyn Wimbish\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    8. The MVP race just got interesting againWhen Nikola Jokić went down with a hyperextended knee right before New Year's, it looked like it would bring an end to his MVP bid on account of not being able to meet the 65-game threshold. But the Nuggets superstar made it back just in time to be able to miss exactly one more game the rest of the way and maintain award eligibility. As long as Jokić remains eligible, this is a tight race between him and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who has been out with an injury of his own as the Thunder have lost six of their last 11. Also lurking is Victor Wembanyama, who has missed 14 games so far and thus can miss three more while remaining eligible. SGA remains the betting favorite (Gilgeous-Alexander has -190 odds to Jokić's +300, while Wembanyama is currently a +3300 longshot).As mentioned above, San Antonio is a real threat to catch OKC for the No. 1 seed; they're three games back and own the tiebreaker via a 4-1 head-to-head advantage. Wembanyama's numbers considering he's only playing 29 minutes a game are crazy. Factoring in both ends of the court, he's probably the most impactful per-minute player in the NBA, and if the Spurs do claim the No. 1 seed it will be tough to not consider him seriously for MVP. Now add in Cade Cunningham, Luka Doncic and Jaylen Brown, and this race that once looked to be all but sewn up for SGA when Jokić went down suddenly looks like it could be in for a photo finish. -- Brad Botkin\n            ",

    "body": "\n        34 days until Opening Day ... Will Konnor Griffin make the Opening Day roster? Is Chase Burns actually battling for a rotation spot? Is Andrew Painter ready to make an impact?If you've been scrolling through social media looking for Fantasy Baseball discussions and analysis, you've surely seen those questions and much more floating around. And the truth is: Nobody knows! The period between when pitchers and catchers report and games actually start, is peak speculative season around these parts, after all.Oh sure, we've gotten answers to some questions, though, unfortunately, those were to questions we didn't even know to be asking, such as: \"Is Pablo Lopez's elbow intact?\" As we learned this week, the answer to that one, unfortunately, is no. But those first three questions, and a bunch more, don't have any answers yet. And they won't at least until those games start. The good news is, we're about to start getting answers. The first games kick off Friday, and over the weekend, every team will get into action for the first time. We're going to start seeing who is in the lead for position battles and which hoped-for breakouts are going to have to wait. \nWe'll spend the next month making sure you have all the answers you need. Today, we're just starting to ask the questions. I've got the biggest question for every National League team in today's newsletter, and we'll commemorate the start of spring action Friday by looking at the biggest question for every American League team. Here's what we'll be watching in the NL this spring:The biggest question for each NL teamPittsburgh Pirates - Is Konnor Griffin up on Opening Day?Nothing is assured, but I think his future is in his own hands. The drumbeat in the early part of camp around the shows Griffin is putting on during batting practice has been loud, and the Pirates probably can't afford to play service time games with another top prospect after the backlash they generated (including in their own clubhouse, reportedly) from doing that with Bubba Chandler last year. If Griffin falls on his face this spring, he won't make the team. But if he holds his own, I think we're looking at our first age-19 MLB debut by a position player since Juan Soto. And Griffin will be a top-150 pick (at least) if that happens. Cincinnati Reds - Is Chase Burns really fighting for a rotation spot? Burns tore through the minors and made it to the big league rotation in his very first professional season, so it was a surprise to see an MLB.com headline recently note that Burns is in for a \"rotation battle.\" That certainly raised a lot of eyebrows around the Fantasy community, with the story noting Burns is in a competition with Rhett Lowder, Brandon Williamson, and Julian Aguilar. Beyond the fact that attrition could create multiple rotation spots before the end of the spring, I feel pretty confident that Burns would have to completely flop this spring to lose this battle. With all due respect to the Reds' other options – which include a former first-rounder who has MLB experience in Lowder – Burns already established himself as a potential difference maker as a rookie, putting together four double-digit strikeout efforts in a five-start span. Nothing is guaranteed in this life, but I suspect this is a competition in name only. \nAtlanta Braves - Do they have enough pitching? No. Next question. Okay, technically, the Braves have a full rotation right now, even with Spencer Schwellenbach and Hurston Waldrep on the IL to open the season after elbow surgery. But there are no sure things about Chris Sale, Spencer Strider, Reynaldo Lopez, and Grant Holmes, all of whom have missed significant time in the past two seasons. There is young depth here and plenty of upside, to be sure, but this is a team that pretty obviously needs a Lucas Giolito type, if for nothing else than to sop up some innings. I don't expect Atlanta's Opening Day rotation to look like it does right now, and for their sake, I hope that isn't because they suffer another significant injury. Arizona Diamondbacks - Do they still have faith in Jordan Lawlar?It sure doesn't seem like it after they went out and traded for the husk of Nolan Arenado. Lawlar has played the infield almost exclusively in his career, but his only path to playing time (barring injury) right now looks to be through a transition to center field. He has the athleticism to handle it, but asking a player who has proven everything he can at Triple-A to try to make the leap to the majors while also learning a new position can hardly be said to be putting them in position to succeed. I remain hopeful about Lawlar's skill set translating, but I'd like to see some signs this spring that the Diamondbacks share that hope. St. Louis Cardinals - How much will Ivan Herrera catch?Herrera dealt with elbow injuries that limited him to just 14 games behind the plate in 2025, and nobody really thinks he's going to be the team's long-term answer behind the plate. But he's going to be part of the team's answers somewhere, and for Fantasy purposes at least, we'd like him to at least get five (or 10, even) appearances behind the plate so he can gain eligibility there. So it was interesting to see a picture from Cardinals camp the other day that showed Herrera working out with the outfielders (while wearing a first baseman's mitt, natch). The Cardinals toyed with playing Herrera in the outfield last season, and first base would seem to be a natural landing spot eventually, ala Willson Contreras. \nThe good news is, it's clear the Cardinals are aware of how impactful his bat can be and are doing what they can to get it in the lineup. But his Fantasy value will take a hit if it doesn't look like he's going to play behind the plate at all. The good news is that Herrera might just be a viable starting Fantasy option anywhere, including if he remains Util-only – he had 19 homers in just 452 plate appearances last season and is a .286/.370/.426 hitter across 203 career MLB games. That bat will play anywhere. Miami Marlins - Do the prospects have a path to the rotation? I'm talking about Robby Snelling and Thomas White, specifically, and I think both guys will get a chance. White is arguably the top left-handed pitching prospect in baseball (and he isn't far from being the top one of any handedness), while Snelling was nothing less than one of the best pitchers at the Triple-A level last season, so both are talents worth getting excited about. And both have accomplished enough in the high minors to think there isn't a ton left for them to learn down there.But as things stand, both look to be on the outside looking in. The obstacles in their place aren't insurmountable, by any means – Chris Paddack, Max Meyer, and Janson Junk could all be relatively expendable – but between service time considerations and the knowledge that you always need more than five starters to get through the season might tilt the Marlins' thinking toward keeping the two talented young lefties down, at least to start the season. But we'll see both before long, I suspect.\nSide note: I didn't mention Braxton Garrett as one of the \"relatively expendable\" pitchers, though he could certainly fit there, too. But I'm intrigued by reports that he is hitting 95 mph in his early-spring mound work as he works his way back from Tommy John surgery. Garrett has only ever even hit 94 mph in the big leagues one time, so if we're looking at a couple of ticks of improvement from a guy who was already pretty solid (sub-3.70 ERA in both 2022 and 2023), that's moderately exciting. I'm putting him on my deep sleeper watchlist, at least. New York Mets - How much do they trust the youth movement?The Mets figure to have one locked in member of their vaunted prospect group on the Opening Day roster, with pitcher Nolan McLean looking to build off a truly excellent MLB debut in 2025. They used a few other prized pieces to acquire Freddy Peralta, but still have a pretty stacked farm system, including plenty of guys who look ready for the majors, like Carson Benge and Jonah Tong. Those are the two likeliest contenders to crack the roster, but I think Benge's chances are much better than Tong's. The Mets don't have a great rotation, but they do have depth, and I imagine they'd like to see if they can squeeze the best versions of guys like Sean Manaea and Kodai Senga out before turning to a guy who didn't exactly set the world on fire when he got the call late last season. It might only take one or two injuries to give Tong an opportunity, but I'd bet against it at least at first.\nBut Benge? I'd be disappointed if he wasn't the starting right fielder for the Mets. It is by no means a fait accompli, but the alternative seems to be turning to Brett Baty, who has played just a few weeks' worth of games in the outfield in his life. Benge was a below-average hitter in his 24 games at Triple-A late last season, but that was mostly because of a .188 BABIP – he struck out at a below-average rate, showed patience, and had an average exit velocity of 92.1 mph, so I don't have too much concern about the mediocre surface-level numbers. He's primarily been a pretty good center fielder, so he should be a much better option defensively than Baty, and I don't think Baty is more talented as a hitter, even if he's certainly more proven. Benge needs to go out there and win the job, but if he proves worthy, I think the job is his. Los Angeles Dodgers - Is Emmett Sheehan assured of a rotation spot?With Blake Snell potentially out of the picture for Opening Day, any six-man permutation of the Dodgers rotation should include Sheehan. But when Snell is back, I do think Sheehan might be sixth in the pecking order, which could mean he's first in line to be skipped if the schedule demands it. That happened a few times last year, and the Dodgers never quite embraced Sheehan the way Fantasy players would like, which is the only reason I have my concerns about his usage. He's an extremely talented pitcher, but hasn't earned his team's trust, which could become an issue if he falters. I don't expect him to – he has wicked swing-and-miss stuff and huge upside – but he has been delayed in the early part of spring due to an illness, and the presence of Ben Casparius, Justin Wrobleski, Gavin Stone, and River Ryan could give the Dodgers alternatives. \nChicago Cubs - Is there room for the prospects to play right away?The Owen Caissie trade cleared up one roadblock, but others remain. Matt Shaw isn't a prospect anymore, but he looks pretty blocked after the signing of Alex Bregman, putting his development on hold for a role as a utility player. And then we have interesting names like Kevin Alcantara and Moises Ballesteros, who have had a taste of the majors but not much more than that. Alcantara looks set to be the fourth outfielder, while Ballesteros looks set for a part-time DH role. Getting Ballesteros some reps behind the plate this spring might be a sign that they still view him as an option for catcher, and that's vital to his long-term value – the bar for a Util-only player in Fantasy remains a lot higher than for a catcher. If Ballesteros isn't playing in the field this spring, it'll be a lot harder to justify him as a sleeper. Milwaukee Brewers -Is Andrew Vaughn just the everyday first baseman? There are certainly bigger questions here, though they aren't the kind we'll actually get answers to this spring – Jacob Misiorowski, Brandon Woodruff, and Logan Henderson just have to go out and stay healthy before we'll know whether they can, you know? So we'll pivot to a less pressing question that nonetheless could matter very much for Fantasy. Vaughn opened a lot of eyes with his play after joining the Brewers last summer, and while he slowed down eventually, he still managed a .308/.375/.493 line in 64 games, including the best underlying numbers of his career. Despite that, there is very little hype or interest in him for Fantasy entering 2026, which makes me wonder if I've missed something about his role. Looking at the depth chart, I'm not sure what the alternative would be to Vaughn – maybe he platoons with Jake Bauers, but I don't see Bauers as an everyday player at this point, and I can't imagine the Brewers do. There are reasons to buy into Vaughn's second-half breakout, and if he truly is the everyday 1B in this lineup and ballpark, he could be a great value with an ADP outside of the top 300. \nPhiladelphia Phillies - Have they lost faith in Andrew Painter?I'll say this for Painter: The Phillies sure didn't approach this offseason like they've lost faith in the one-time top pitching prospect in baseball. Despite letting Ranger Suarez walk and having Zack Wheeler coming off serious shoulder surgery, the Phillies didn't really make any additions to their rotation, likely leaving Taijuan Walker and Painter to open the season in the final two spots. Painter will have to perform well to remain in the rotation if and when Wheeler is healthy enough to pitch, and that's no sure thing coming off a season where he put up a 5.26 ERA in the minors while pitching with altered mechanics coming off Tommy John surgery. The raw stuff remains very impressive, and if Painter shines this spring, I suspect we'll start to see his price rise. With an ADP as the 306th player off the board in February drafts, it's not hard to see the upside. San Diego Padres - How much of Jackson Merrill's struggles were health-related?He was hitting .304 with an OPS north of .800 when he suffered a concussion in mid-June, and then floundered for the next couple of months while also battling hamstring and ankle injuries. I'm inclined to give Merrill the benefit of the doubt that we'll see at least a return to what he did as a rookie, when he finished with 24 homers and 16 RBI while hitting .292. In fact, I'm pretty open to even better than that, seeing as he was just 21 as a rookie. But I'm kind of on an island in ranking Merrill as a top-12 outfielder, and Scott White made the case against him during our outfield preview earlier this week, which is worth checking out. What I want to see from Merrill this spring: How about a willingness to run after he dropped from 16 to just one steal in his second season?San Francisco Giants - Is Bryce Eldridge ready to make an impact?Eldridge is currently just the 391st player off the board in February drafts, and I think this is one of those situations where his 10-game cup of coffee late in the season is affecting folks' perception of him, even if we all know a 10-game sample size is effectively meaningless. Part of that is because Eldridge primarily played DH in those 10 appearances, leaving him with Util-only eligibility entering drafts. But we are talking about a hitter who will be 21 all season long and has 70-grade power; this time a year ago, you could ask most prospect analysts to pick him or Nick Kurtz, and it might have been a coin flip's call. Eldridge did have wrist surgery this offseason, so I'd like to see him hitting the ball with authority this spring and winning a job splitting time between DH and 1B with Rafael Devers, rather than being awarded it by default.  \nColorado Rockies - Is there anyone worth getting excited about? I'll admit, I can't work up much excitement over the likes of Mickey Moniak or Ezequiel Tovar, even as relatively cheap fliers – in Moniak's case, I don't have any faith he can hit lefties or hit away from Coors Field, which makes him useful about 37% of the time, roughly. Hunter Goodman is excellent, but there's little in the way of exciting youth on this team.But I'll give you three names from the Rockies I'm definitely keeping an eye on this spring: Jake McCarthy, Edouard Julien, and Zac Veen. For both McCarthy and Julien, we're talking about pretty established players who just haven't been particularly good previously in their careers, so the hope is that Coors Field can inflate their production enough to make both of them relevant for Fantasy. I'm a bit more optimistic about that coming to fruition for McCarthy, who could be a batting average and stolen base standout, but I did keep Julien in my 24-team Dynasty league at the last minute after seeing him shipped to Colorado. Yeah, that's damming with faint praise, but such are the meager joys in Colorado.Veen, on the other hand, now there might just be something here. The former top prospect was productive at Triple-A in 2025, hitting .289/.359/.464 in 90 games, but he got just a brief stint with the Rockies and looked overwhelmed when he was in the lineup. We learned this week that Veen has been dealing with substance abuse issues in recent years that threatened to derail his career, but he says he is \"completely clean and sober\" after this offseason and is in much better shape, both physically and mentally. That could help get Veen back on track in his career, too, and a big spring could put him back in the Rockies' immediate plans. I'll be rooting for it. \nWashington Nationals - Can the new brain trust turn things around?Looking for something more concrete? I suppose I could have focused on Harry Ford's attempts to usurp Keibert Ruiz as the primary catcher, or James Wood's chances of bouncing back from his legitimately terrifying second-half slump; heck, I could focus on Dylan Crews and the hope he finally gives us a reason to buy into the hype he once showed.But ultimately, I want to see some signs of the Nationals growing up as an organization. They installed a new, conspicuously young front office and coaching staff group this offseason, and I want to see some sign that they're becoming a bit more forward-thinking than the group that put up signs last spring saying, \"I don't care how fast you throw ball four.\" The Nationals don't lack for talent, but it seems like their most intriguing young players have largely stalled out in the majors, leaving us actively rooting for Mackenzie Gore to be traded to a more competent developmental team. I want to see some sign from this group that they have a better idea of how to help guys like Wood, Crews, and C.J. Abrams sand down the rough edges to their games and blossom into actual superstars. They have the potential. Let's put them in the right position to succeed, now. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Among the biggest issues facing the NBA these days is how roughly a third of the league has no interest in winning games. It's a byproduct of the lottery system that gives franchises with the most losses the best chance to pick as high as possible in the next draft.Not all fans agree with tanking, I know; it's not a fun way to spend the final two months of the season. But if you're one of the fans who wants to understand why it's happening to this degree, all you had to do was watch college basketball Wednesday night because some of the best possible prizes from the 2026 NBA Draft were on display and awesome.Let's start with Arkansas' Darius Acuff Jr.Yes, the Razorbacks lost 117-115 in double-overtime at Alabama in part because the Crimson Tide's Labaron Philon Jr., a possible lottery pick himself, went for 35 points and seven assists -- but Acuff was still the story. The 6-foot-3 guard from Detroit took 27 shots, made 16 of them and finished with 49 points, five assists and five rebounds in 50 -- yes, 50! -- minutes on the court. His 49 points are the most scored by any freshman in Division I men's basketball since Georgia Tech's Kenny Anderson got 50 in a win over Loyola Marymount in December 1990.(That's a crazy fact considering all of the freshmen who have played between then and now. Hand to heart, I would not have assumed that's true. But it is, according to the back row in the bullpen at the CBS Broadcast Center, otherwise known as the research team.)\n\"He was in a [walking] boot for two days -- and still did that,\" Arkansas coach John Calipari said of Acuff. \"And I said, 'You think you might have to miss this game?' And he said, 'Are you nuts?\" He doesn't care. Hurt, whatever it is. He was in a boot for two days.\"That's an interesting quote -- and probably the perfect place to transition to Kansas freshman Darryn Peterson, who, in contrast to Acuff, very much does (seem to) care about how he feels before determining how much to play or even whether to play at all. That's been the narrative connected to him all season. Wednesday didn't help.Peterson started for the Jayhawks, scored 20 points in the first half, added three more early in the second ... and then appeared, once again, to check himself out of the game with 17:40 remaining.\nTake a look for yourself.\nPeterson never returned.As I've said many times, if it's just a talent evaluation, Peterson should be the No. 1 pick in June. But all of the odd stuff connected to his availability might make it more of a conversation than it otherwise would be, especially with so many other awesome options available at the top of the draft -- like BYU freshman AJ Dybantsa, Tennessee freshman Nate Ament and Illinois freshman Keaton Wagler.All three of them played Wednesday, too.Dybantsa got 35 points and seven rebounds in BYU's 75-68 loss at Arizona. Ament got 29 points and six rebounds in Tennessee's 89-66 win over Oklahoma. And though Wagler wasn't great in Illinois' 101-65 victory at USC -- the 6-6 guard finished with only 10 points and four assists in 29 minutes -- he remains the best player on a team that's No. 7 in Thursday morning's updated CBS Sports Top 25 And 1 daily college basketball rankings, where Michigan remains No. 1 for the 10th consecutive day.Wagler will be a top-10 pick.Bottom line, at least six potential lottery picks -- Peterson, Dybantsa, Acuff, Philon, Ament and Wagler -- and possibly more, were in action Wednesday, and two of them went into the record books. Acuff set the single-game scoring record for a freshman at Arkansas. Dybantsa set the single-season scoring record for a freshman at BYU. They're both special, undeniably.\nWhy are so many NBA teams tanking?That's why.The lottery for the 2026 NBA Draft is scheduled for May 10.

Ball was not injured in the two-car crash, which came at an intersection downtown and totaled his vehicle.Video obtained by WSOC-TV showed Ball's vehicle making contact on the driver's side with a KIA sedan shortly before 5 p.m. Wednesday. The front left tire of Ball's Hummer came off of the vehicle during the accident before the GMC came to a stop near the shoulder.Ball was later spotted at the scene being picked up in a Lamborghini shortly after the accident. Both cars involved in the wreck were reportedly towed from the scene, but an accident report has not been made available.\nThe Hornets have won 10 of their last 11 games with Ball leading the charge. The sixth-year pro and former No. 3 overall pick is averaging 19.3 points per game and 7.4 assists this season.Charlotte (26-29) is currently the No. 9 seed in the Eastern Conference standings, 3.5 games back of Miami. The Hornets' starting lineup of Ball, standout rookie Kon Kneuppel, Brandon Miller, Miles Bridges and Moussa Diabate has the franchise in line to make its first postseason appearance since the 2015-16 season if the hot streak continues.\nEarlier this month against the Rockets, Ball led the Hornets with 20 points during a road victory, which marked Charlotte's eighth straight win -- the first time that's happened since the 1999-00 season.\n            \n",

    "body": "\n        With the trade deadline and All-Star break in the rearview mirror and NBA action resuming Thursday night, the stretch run is upon us. Every team has between 26 and 29 games remaining, and of course, there is a wide disparity in the difficult of those remaining schedules. This will certainly factor, perhaps heavily, into the various postseason races and ultimately the final picture. Just as an example, if the Thunder are going to hold off the charging Spurs for the West's top seed, they'll have to do so while navigating the league's second-toughest remaining slate. The Cavs, meanwhile, are within striking distance of the East's No. 2 seed and have the league's fifth-easiest stretch-run schedule, while Boston, currently two games up on Cleveland, is saddled with the fifth-toughest. A big part of all this is of course the tanking issue that everyone is talking about right now. If you're a team fighting for playoff positioning, the more games you have left against teams actively trying to lose the better. \n\n        \n            \n                Eight best storylines for NBA stretch run: Is Jayson Tatum coming back? Can Spurs jump OKC? MVP up for grabs?\n                \n                    Jasmyn Wimbish                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSo first, let's identify the teams that are, no matter what method of deception they choose to hopefully avoid punishment, in the unmitigated business of tanking for the best lottery odds possible the rest of the way. Washington WizardsIndiana PacersBrooklyn NetsSacramento KingsUtah JazzDallas MavericksThose six are unquestioned. They have absolutely no incentive to win a single game the rest of the way. Add to that the Grizzlies and Bucks, the latter of whom should be, and probably will be, an increasingly egregious tanker moving forward (their only valuable asset moving forward, either as a building block for a post-Giannis future or as part of a trade package to try to keep Giannis), and take out the Pelicans who don't own their '26 pick, and you have eight tanking teams. So, which contenders/postseason hopefuls have the most remaining games against these teams? Here's a look at the Eastern Conference. \nPLAYOFF HOPEFULS \t\t\t\tTANKING OPPONENTS \t\t\t\t76ers \t\t\t\t9 \t\t\t\tHawks \t\t\t\t9 \t\t\t\tHornets \t\t\t\t9 \t\t\t\tCavaliers \t\t\t\t9 \t\t\t\tKnicks \t\t\t\t8 \t\t\t\tMagic \t\t\t\t8 \t\t\t\tRaptors \t\t\t\t8 \t\t\t\tHeat \t\t\t\t7 \t\t\t\tPistons \t\t\t\t7 \t\t\t\tCeltics \t\t\t\t4 \t\t\t\tYou can see how much this could end up impacting the playoff picture. Take the Celtics, for instance. They enter their final 28 games with a one-game lead over the No. 3 Knicks and a two-game lead over the No. 4 Cavs (in the loss column), but while Boston has just four games left against tanking teams the Knicks have eight and the Cavs have nine.  Now let's look at the West.  PLAYOFF HOPEFULS \t\t\t\tTANKING OPPONENTS \t\t\t\tTrail Blazers \t\t\t\t10 \t\t\t\tWarriors \t\t\t\t9 \t\t\t\tClippers \t\t\t\t8 \t\t\t\tLakers \t\t\t\t8 \t\t\t\tRockets \t\t\t\t7 \t\t\t\tSpurs \t\t\t\t7 \t\t\t\tThunder \t\t\t\t7 \t\t\t\tSuns \t\t\t\t7 \t\t\t\tNuggets \t\t\t\t6 \t\t\t\tTimberwolves \t\t\t\t5 \t\t\t\tAgain, you can see the potential impact here. The Timberwolves are only one game back of the Lakers, but the Lakers have three more tank opponents left than Minnesota. The Suns are only two losses back of the Wolves for the final playoff spot and they have two more tank games left than Minnesota.  In theory, these should be pretty much guaranteed wins and having more of them is a big deal and one of the real downstream effects of nearly a third of the league being incentivized to lose the rest of the way.If Adam Silver wants this to stop, he's going to have to drastically alter the draft system, if not scrap it totally and treat incoming rookies just like every other free agent, though that idea comes with a lot of unintended pitfalls of its own. There's no great answer here, but know this: Until someone figures one out, it is always going to be the smart play for these lower-class teams to drop in the standings and rise in the lottery, and we're going to be seeing a lot of this over these six weeks. Think about it: If you're one of these eight teams with either no shot to even make the play-in or battling for a No. 10 seed, the simple truth of the matter is that every win over these next six weeks is, in fact, a loss. The benefit of possibly landing a superstar rookie who could completely reshape your franchise's trajectory over the next decade plus is just too great in comparison to winning a few more games and possibly making the play-in tournament. Just look at the Mavericks last year. They were one win from making the playoffs. Had they beaten Memphis, they wouldn't have had any lottery balls in the hopper. But they lost that game, giving them a 1.8% chance to land the top overall pick, and I'll be damned if it didn't happen. Now they have Cooper Flagg. The Sixers lost 29 of their final 33 games last year and it yielded them VJ Edgecombe. It's a no-brainer. Lose now to win later. All these teams are going to do it, and it's not just going to effect the ultimate lottery order. It's likely going to impact the playoff picture in a meaningful way. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        More than at any other hitter position, your approach to the outfield will depend on your format. Standard Head-to-Head lineups require only three. Standard Rotisserie lineups require five. Four would be the sweet spot that best accounts for the distribution of talent at the position, but alas, this isn't slow-pitch softball.  Let's tackle three first because it's easier. I don't just mean more straightforward but easier, like a piece of cake. As with catcher and shortstop, you can hardly mess it up when playing on the shallower end of the pool. I count about 40 outfielders that would be satisfactory starters in such a format, along with a few other pure upside plays, so if you just do the math -- 12 teams needing three outfielders each -- you're covered.  Position Strategies: C | 1B | 2B | 3B | SS | OF | SP | RPPosition Tiers: C | 1B | 2B | 3B | SS | OF | SP | RPChances are you'll come out of the first round with one of your three outfield spots filled already given that one-third of the players selected there are outfielders. I'd be reluctant to invest both of those picks in outfielders, but again, I'm speaking for three-outfielder leagues here.  In five-outfielder leagues, there isn't much harm in using your first two picks on outfielders, if that's the way the draft shakes out, because there will come a point when you're picking through the remains either way. What you don't want to do is wait so long to take your first outfielder that you end up on loose footing for all five outfield spots. You will spring a leak or two at this position, almost certainly, but if instead of one or two, it's four or five that you're attempting to plug off the waiver wire, your boat is going down.   \nIdeally, you'd make a point to grab one of The Studs in a five-outfielder league and at least one, preferably two, of The Starters that follow.

They're mostly bound by draft position, so if you happen to pick in the right spot, great. Take advantage. In fact, I'd be ahead of the consensus on Kyle Tucker, who I suspect is in for a career performance while batting amid the Dodgers' Hall of Fame trio of Shohei Ohtani, Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman. He's been a first-rounder in Fantasy since about the time he broke into the league, delivering high home run and stolen base totals and usually with a good batting average. He's gained a reputation for being injury-prone because of a stress fracture in his shin two years ago and a hairline fracture in his hand last year that he actually played through, but those aren't the sort of soft tissue injuries that I'd expect to recur. Meanwhile, his run and RBI production could reach new heights this year.   I prefer Jose Ramirez to Juan Soto in 5x5 leagues, which means Soto checks in fifth rather than fourth for me in those formats (third in Head-to-Head points, where he's ahead of both Ramirez and Bobby Witt). That's mostly for position scarcity reasons, but I'm also skeptical Soto will come close to the 38 steals he had last year now that the instigator of his success, first base coach Antoan Richardson, has moved on to the Braves. That's a minor disagreement, though. The only one of the first- or second-rounders that I'd deliberately avoid at his going rate is Corbin Carroll, whose recently fractured hamate bone may sideline him into April and could theoretically hinder his production thereafter. His ADP since the injury is closer to 15th, but I have him 21st.  \nStill, I'm saying your first outfielder doesn't have to be one of the first- or second-rounders. It could be Cody Bellinger, whose point-per-game average really does make the case, particularly since nothing he did last year is beyond what he could sustain at Yankee Stadium. In fact, I made him my top outfielder in a recent 15-team Rotisserie mock draft and was happy with the way that team came out. I trust Bellinger more than Pete Crow-Armstrong and James Wood, both of whom have obvious flaws and cratered in the second half of what was otherwise a breakout season, but their upside earns them the edge on Draft Day. I'm just more focused on first base at the point where they normally go.  By ADP, Byron Buxton and George Springer don't belong with this group. By 2025 performance, they most certainly do. I'm not sure what to make of them exactly. The downside risk is clear -- Buxton with his extensive injury history and Springer with his sudden about-face after years of decline -- but I'm leaning toward seeing the glass half full. The cost is reasonable, and few of the outfielders who follow are even capable of achieving the numbers they just did. To the degree I can help it, though, I'd want someone more reliable in my top outfield spot.

Don't be misled into believing these high-floor outfielders are lacking in ceiling, though. We know Brent Rooker and Jarren Duran are capable of more, for instance, because we saw it in 2024. The point is simply that you can feel more secure in what this group of Starters is going to provide than the next one.  \nI'm almost certain to grab an outfielder from this group, and I may even take two. That's all more likely in Head-to-Head points leagues, where some of the lower-priced options in particular stand out. Brandon Nimmo, Ian Happ, Steven Kwan, Jurickson Profar, and Sal Frelick add so much just through good plate discipline (you see it in the point-per-game averages) that it's worth going the extra round in that format to fill your third and final outfield spot with one of them. I actually think Nimmo and Happ are two of the most underrated players regardless of format. Their run and RBI production flies under the radar but is consistently strong.  Do Kwan and Frelick really belong in this group in Rotisserie, given their modest home run and stolen base production? It's debatable. Kwan seems a lot more valuable when he's hitting .292, like two years ago, than .272, like last year, and I imagine Frelick will be the same way. If either winds up as your No. 2 outfielder in such a format, you'll be wishing you had sprung for a Randy Arozarena or Seiya Suzuki.

I suspect that Tyler Soderstrom, for instance, performed closer to his floor than his ceiling in 2025, even though most would call it his breakout season. Meanwhile, Michael Harris still went 20/20 in what was likely a worst-case for him, and Roman Anthony's high exit velocities and on-base ability will make him darn near must-start even if he doesn't optimize his swing for power. If it wasn't clear from the ADP, Anthony has the most admirers of anyone in this group -- understandably, given that he was a No. 1 overall prospect who made a strong first impression -- but because of those pesky launch-angle issues that also plagued him in the minors, he had a 162-game pace of just 18 homers. I would expect a step forward in his first full year, but I'm not sure the ADP accounts enough for what could be an underwhelming combined home run and stolen base total.  To be fair, though, I'm not head-over-heels for most anyone in this group. Jackson Merrill is being given all benefit of the doubt for an injury-plagued sophomore season, but as you can read in my Busts 1.0, his track record is so slim that I don't have a strong read on what exactly we're getting. Oneil Cruz just batted .200 and seems no closer to figuring out his issues at age 27. I like Kyle Stowers, but his breakthrough was interrupted by a strained oblique, which makes it less than definitive. Jo Adell seemed to earn everything he got and then some during a breakout 2025, but his long history of futility gives me pause. Luis Robert is coming off a gnarly past couple seasons. Jakob Marsee is another bust pick of mine. Lawrence Butler disappointed so badly last season that he wasn't even playing against lefties by the end. Andy Pages' exit velocity readings don't back up his production, and the Dodgers ended up benching him in the playoffs. Mike Trout finally managed to stay healthy last season, but his strikeout rate jumped by such an enormous degree (landing at 32 percent) that I wouldn't necessarily describe him as a plus hitter anymore, even if he clears the all-too-frequent injury hurdle.  I'm not saying I wouldn't draft them if my need in the outfield was great enough, but I'm not eager to at cost and wouldn't do so with confidence. You'll notice one name I skipped over, though. Yes, Dauton Varsho is among my favorite breakout picks for 2026. He saw his exit velocities jump by more than 3 mph last year, had a 162-game pace of 46 home runs, and started every single game of the Blue Jays' lengthy postseason run, putting to rest any concerns of a platoon. I'm not saying he's an open-and-shut case, but I am saying the upside is considerable relative to the cost.  \nThe DH-onlys  \t \t  2026 ADP2025 PPG2025 BA2025 HR\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Shohei Ohtani\n                    \n            \n            \n            LAD DH\n        \n            \n        \n14.31.28155\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Kyle Schwarber\n                    \n            \n            \n            PHI LF\n        \n            \n        \n203.84.24056\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Yordan Alvarez\n                    \n            \n            \n            HOU DH\n        \n            \n        \n312.66.2736\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Christian Yelich\n                    \n            \n            \n            MIL LF\n        \n            \n        \n953.08.26429\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Ivan Herrera\n                    \n            \n            \n            STL C\n        \n            \n        \n1553.08.28319\n    \n    \n                                            \n            \n                Marcell Ozuna\n            \n            \n            PIT DH\n        \n            \n        \n3022.41.23221\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Bryce Eldridge\n                    \n            \n            \n            SF 1B\n        \n            \n        \n3311.15.260*25*\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Moises Ballesteros\n                    \n            \n            \n            CHC C\n        \n            \n        \n3472.65.316*13**minor-league stats  There's never a convenient place to stick the DH-onlys, who don't number enough to merit their own strategy guide but shouldn't be ignored either. I've double represented some of them this year, listing Bryce Eldridge at first base and Ivan Herrera and Moises Ballesteros at catcher since I suspect they'll regain eligibility there. Among the others, there isn't much to say about Shohei Ohtani except that I'd prefer Aaron Judge to him outside of daily leagues, where you could take advantage of Ohtani's pitching without losing much in the way of hitting. Some might balk at Kyle Schwarber's price tag because it's never been so high, but now that he's more reliably a .240 hitter, his monstrous production in three categories is well worth the cost. Conversely, Yordan Alvarez's price tag has never been so low, but his health concerns probably aren't going away. I have mixed feelings about taking him where I'm normally looking to grab my first baseman, particularly since doing so preempts me from drafting Christian Yelich and Herrera, whose price tags are even harder for me to resist.

these \"sleepers,\" but it's less an expression of my own personal enthusiasm for them than a recognition that we don't really know what they'll do in 2026. Maybe \"dice throws\" would be a more appropriate term, and the same goes for the \"sleepers\" in all of my other position strategies articles.  I do have a couple favorites, though, with Bryan Reynolds being one. We're used to drafting him about 100 picks earlier, and I don't think his disappointing season should have damaged his stock so much. The strikeout rate crept up a little, but he impacted the ball the same as usual and made some mechanical tweaks in the second half that seemed to put him back on proper footing. Ramon Laureano is also a prime target of mine. Would you believe he has the 19th-best wRC+ since joining the Braves midway through 2024 (playing a total of 199 games during that time), which places him ahead of Freddie Freeman, Fernando Tatis, Rafael Devers and Julio Rodriguez, to name a few. It's to his credit that he's sustained that level of production for three different teams.  \nJac Caglianone was basically useless after getting the call in June, but strikeouts weren't really the issue. For as well as he impacts the ball, the breakthrough should come in short order. Daylen Lile was unknown to me and most everyone else until the Nationals began giving him at-bats in the middle of last season, and it culminated with a ridiculous September in which he hit  .391 with six homers and seven triples. His exit velocities are suspect and he hasn't learned to optimize his speed yet, but there's enough here for me to speculate on him as my fourth outfielder.

All three have the inside track on a starting job for their respective teams, and all three have the potential to be Fantasy gold. Benge is the best all-around threat, standing out most for his hit tool and on-base skills while also contributing power and speed. An outcome between Christian Yelich and Kyle Tucker is plausible. Crawford has the most specialized skill set, excelling in batting average and stolen bases (much like his dad and former Fantasy first-rounder, Carl Crawford). It's a profile that doesn't click as often in the modern game, but Crawford is perfectly molded for it and has little competition for his role with the Phillies. Finally, Caissie, who the Marlins acquired from the Cubs in the Edward Cabrera trade, is a three-true-outcomes guy who grew into his power potential last year and is overdue for this opportunity.  I don't know if their cost will remain so low as spring training starts up and their trajectories become clearer, but at the cost of a late-round pick, the downside isn't even worth expressing. What gives me some hope that they'll remain legitimate sleeper picks is that Chase DeLauter and Dylan Beavers, two prospects who happened to get some major league action last year, seem all the more likely to claim a roster spot, and yet their cost is restrained as well. I like them, too, just not as much as those other three.  \nMickey Moniak and Dominic Canzone made a strong enough impression in part-time duty last year -- Canzone especially with his premium exit velocities -- that I'd be happy to take a late-round flier on either of them, but seeing as they're in their late 20s and still haven't broken free of a platoon role yet, I'm doubtful they ever will.     The Base-Stealers  Here's where I'd normally provide a wealth of information about all the viable base-stealers at the position in question, but there are so many in the outfield that I have to limit that information to how many bases each of them stole last year. It may not fully express the potential for everybody, particularly those who stole only a handful because of time missed, but it'll give you a close enough approximation. If nothing else, I would say that 20 steals isn't out of reach for any of these players.

    "body": "\n        INDIANAPOLIS -- Will the NCAA Tournament expand in 2027? NCAA president Charlie Baker neglected to answer that question when asked Thursday morning at the organization's headquarters. Baker met with 10 members of the media and wrapped the informal interview session by reinforcing his opinion: he would prefer to see March Madness expand. \"I think there's some very good reasons to expand the tournament, so I would like to see it expand,\" Baker said. The NCAA's men's and women's basketball committees have been debating and deliberating the concept of expanding their 68-team tournaments for close to four years now. The general public -- and much of the sports media -- stands opposed to the idea of watering down one of the country's most treasured sporting events. \n\"For now, we're still talking to the various players in this one,\" Baker said. \"You have to remember that some of the folks we're talking to are going through some pretty interesting corporate conversations of their own. And I think for us, we accept and acknowledge that, but we're still talking.\"Baker added that, regardless of what decision is made, the NCAA Tournament will remain with its 32-team automatic-qualifier format (which has never been in jeopardy of changing) in addition to the at-large bids that fill up the field. Baker is of the belief that the 36 at-large cutoff is too small for the number of teams that should get a crack on the biggest stage in the sport. \"That leaves 36 spots,\" Baker said. \"That means you're going to leave a bunch of the top 50 teams out of the tournament, right? ... I mean, couple years ago I was kind of bummed when Seton Hall and Indiana State didn't get in the tournament, because they both had quality wins and quality schedules. ... The more you do to create opportunities for the so-called bubble teams each year to get into the tournament, first of all, it puts some other really good teams that probably might belong there. But it also protects the AQs, right? Because I don't want to end up in a situation where people say we need to do something about the AQs because we're keeping too many good teams out of the tournament.\" \nCBS Sports asked Baker how much it would presumably cost the NCAA to add 16 more schools to the men's and women's tournaments. The cost element has been one of the biggest blockades in the past three years to expansion efforts.\"I think we can figure out how to pay for it. I'm not worried about that,\" Baker said. When pressed on the cost in terms of how many millions of dollars the NCAA is projecting to add to its expenses, Baker neglected to give more specifics. He was also asked what his expectation was for the 2027 NCAA Tournament and he declined to go on the record with a prediction. \nIf the NCAA is going to opt to expand for 2027, a decision is expected in the coming weeks.In addition to expansion talk, Baker spoke at length about the challenges of player eligibility and the constant battles the NCAA has been faced with in regard to rosters, NIL regulations and more. He noted the NCAA has a much better track record in court than is often reflected in the media.\"We win a lot more of those cases than we lose,\" he said.The NCAA provided the statistics: Since December of 2024, there have been 56 lawsuits filed in eligibility cases. Thirty of those 56 have seen denials for the plaintiffs and 12 have been granted. There are seven still going at the state court level now and five are pending. A local judge recently ruled against Charles Bediako's case at Alabama, while Trinidad Chambliss recently logged a victory in court to give him a sixth year of eligibility. \nBaker also said the NCAA is having conversations and bracing for the possibility that a few college football players might try to explore options to return to their college teams, should they fail to make NFL teams at training camps in the summer of 2026.\"It's certainly something we've been talking with folks about it,\" Baker said. \"The basketball piece is just different than the football piece for a whole bunch of reasons, but it's certainly something we're discussing.\"On the topic of eventual collective bargaining, Baker was passionate that it's probably not happening or feasible.\n\"You'd have to get a federal law passed to do that, first of all,\" he said. \"Secondly, student athletes don't want to do that. And third, when everybody says [to collectively bargain] they don't talk about are scholarships now taxable under that arrangement? Does this apply to all the kids in college sports? Because if it does, you can have kids in college sports who are going to have to write checks to their schools to pay for all the benefits they currently get, they don't get taxed on that become benefits that are taxable because they're employees. There's a lot to that issue that nobody ever talks about. ... Saying that is a simple answer to this is not a legitimate response.\" The NCAA has undergone massive changes in the past five years, and Baker has been a proponent for modernizing the 120-year-old organization. For all the progress that has been made with NIL legislation and player empowerment, profound problems still exist and, judging by Baker's comments on Thursday, seem unlikely to be resolved in any major, tangible way in 2026.\"People get paid a lot of money to crystal ball this stuff,\" Baker said. \"It's a hard crystal ball, because so much of it is often driven by outside elements and circumstances, which in some cases are totally unpredictable.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Charles Bediako is once again attempting to return to play for No. 17 Alabama. According to AL.com, the former Crimson Tide center filed an appeal to the Alabama Supreme Court on Monday, two weeks after a Tuscaloosa County circuit court judge denied Bediako's motion seeking a preliminary injunction against NCAA eligibility rules.While Bediako's appeal is pending, he's seeking \"interim injunctive relief\" that would allow him to play immediately.\"The request is to put an injunction in place while the Alabama Supreme Court considers the substance of our argument as to why we believe the Circuit Court's order was incorrect,\" David Holt, one of Bediako's attorneys, told ESPN.Bediako has remained a student at Alabama and helped with the scout team, per coach Nate Oats. Alabama's next game is Wednesday vs. Mississippi State.\nIt's the latest twist in what's been quite the saga for Bediako, the NCAA and eligibility rules.Bediako played for Alabama in 2021-22 and 2022-23 before forgoing the rest of his eligibility and entering the NBA Draft pool. Though he did not get drafted, he signed a two-way contract with the San Antonio Spurs. He never appeared in an NBA game but did play for the Austin Spurs of the NBA G League. He also appeared in G League games for the Grand Rapids Gold and the Motor City Cruise on Exhibit 10 contracts.\n        \n            \n                Charles Bediako ineligible after judge's ruling: Why 7-footer's journey from G League back to Alabama is over\n                \n                    Matt Norlander                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIn late January 2026, Bediako filed suit against the NCAA, requesting \"immediate preliminary and permanent injunctive relief.\" Because Bediako enrolled in Alabama in 2021, he was -- and is still -- within his five-year eligibility clock. Tuscaloosa County judge James Roberts granted Beidako a temporary restraining order against the NCAA, paving the way for him to return to the Crimson Tide. After it was later discovered Roberts is an Alabama donor; he recused himself from the case.\nUnder the order, Bediako played in five games with Alabama from Jan. 24 to Feb. 7, averaging 10 points, 4.6 rebounds and 1.4 blocks while shooting 77%.On Feb. 9, Alabama circuit court judge Daniel Pruet denied Bediako's motion seeking a preliminary injunction against NCAA eligibility rules. The aim of the preliminary injunction had been to allow Bediako to play for the rest of the season.\"Common sense won a round today,\" NCAA president Charlie Baker said in a statement. \"The court saw this for what it is: an attempt by professionals to pivot back to college and crowd out the next generation of students. College sports are for students, not for people who already walked away to go pro and now want to hit the 'undo' button at the expense of a teenager's dream.\n\"While we're glad the court upheld the rules our members actually want, one win doesn't fix the national mess of state laws. It's time for Congress to stop watching from the sidelines and help us provide some actual stability.\"Bediako's return to college basketball after signing multiple NBA contracts had caused significant consternation among NCAA higher-ups, with even SEC commissioner Greg Sankey signing an affidavit against Bediako's cause.After Pruet's ruling, it appeared Bediako's return to college basketball had ended. Now, though, he and his legal team are trying once again. With the end of the regular season (March 7) rapidly approaching, Bediako's motion indicates his request \"will become moot without interim relief\" with the appeal process \"unlikely to resolve before the season concludes.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Dynasty ranking changes from January to February are generally pretty minimal. They are mostly influenced by the smattering of news we get and my first run at 2026 Fantasy Football projections. This year, at quarterback, the changes in the rankings are almost completely nonexistent. Just don't get used to this static situation because before I release my March rankings, there are at least eight quarterbacks who could change uniforms and their Dynasty outlook radically altered.My way-too-early 2026 quarterback projections are here.The first two obvious names are Kyler Murray and Tua Tagovailoa. Both of their respective teams have new coaches and have expressed at least some interest in moving on from their very expensive quarterbacks. The risk of them not finding starting jobs has already been factored in to some degree, but it could be worse. For either of these quarterbacks, if their situations are unresolved a month from now, I will be more nervous. At the same time, if they find a new home as a starter in March, they could be risers. I am more optimistic both about Murray's chances of finding a starting job and his Fantasy upside if he does, which is why he is ranked considerably higher than Tagovailoa.Earlier in February, I had Jay Felicio from QB List on Fantasy Football Today Dynasty to discuss the state of the quarterback position. Check it out:\nThe free agent I am most interested in monitoring in the next month is Malik Willis. From my view, those two teams we just talked about, the Dolphins and the Cardinals, are the two most likely to give Willis a starter's contract in 2026. The path to him being a riser in the next month is if Willis receives a contract that offers him more long-term security than what Justin Fields received last year. These two coaching staffs have close connections to the Packers, so if anyone is willing to take that risk, it should be them. Over the past two seasons, Willis has thrown 89 passes and averaged 10.9 yards per attempt with six touchdowns and zero interceptions. Combine that with his rushing upside, and if Willis gets a three-year deal, he could vault into the top 20 in the rankings below.Other quarterbacks who could see the biggest gains or losses in the next month are Jacoby Brissett, Aaron Rodgers, Daniel Jones, and Geno Smith. Of course, we have no reason to expect Rodgers to make a decision that fast, and we'll have to wait until August at least to see how Jones' rehab is coming. One thing is for sure: We should expect far more changes in the Dynasty QB rankings next month than we got this month. We may even get to add Derek Carr back in if he decides to return to the NFL.I don't rank rookies until they are drafted, but I have already started to think about where I will put them. Assuming Fernando Mendoza is taken first overall by the Raiders, I anticipate he will rank somewhere between QB15 and QB18 in the rankings below. I would be surprised if any other rookie cracks the top 25.\nHere are my updated Dynasty QB rankings:\n            ",

Javonte Williams is staying in Dallas on a three-year deal that assures he will be the starting running back at the beginning of the 2026 season. This is a big win for Williams, but you don't see a lot of movement in his Dynasty ranking below because it is also pretty much what I expect. Williams is still a low-end RB2 with high-end RB2 upside. The truth his that Williams' value did increase, but he is at the top of a tier and still behind Saquon Barkley and RJ Harvey who are at the bottom of the tier above him. But there are several free agent backs around him that could pass him in either direction in the coming month.Breece Hall seems likely to stay in New York with the Jets, as much as we are all hoping he won't. He remains my highest ranked free agent running back, at RB11, but the idea of him being stuck in New York for one more year does not make that ranking as appetizing. He's still just 24 years old and has posted at least 1,300 yards from scrimmage each of the past three years, but the Jets' lack of touchdowns has held down Hall's upside. I don't really expect that to improve much in 2026, but if they could sign a veteran QB who is more willing to dump the ball off to his backs, that would be a help.Check out my way-too-early look at running back projections for 2026 here.Travis Etienne and Kenneth Walker III are the other two top-20 Dynasty backs who don't have a team yet. So far all we have to go on with them is rumors and rumors of rumors. If you believe those, Walker won't be tagged by Seattle and Etienne would like to go to Kansas City. Uncertainty keeps these two backs just behind Williams for now, but a good landing spot could propel either of them in front of him. I'd also be happy with either of them returning to their former team, particularly if Zach Charbonnet misses extended time in Seattle next year.\nEarlier in February I had Dave Kluge from Footballguys on Fantasy Football Today Dynasty to discuss the state of the running back position in Dynasty. Check it out:Of course there are many other backs who could see wild swings in their value in the next month. Rico Dowdle, Isiah Pacheco, Rachaad White, Kenneth Gainwell, and Tyler Allgeier are just a few of them. While I am not sure any of them get starting jobs next year, they could absolutely torpedo a back that we are currently hoping will be a workhorse.As for the rookies, I have pretty low expectations for this class and won't be adding any of them to my Dynasty rankings until after the 2026 NFL Draft. Expect Jeremiyah Love to crack my top seven and don't expect any other rookies to crack my top 20, barring a surprise during the draft.\nHere are my updated Dynasty running back rankings:\n            \n",

    "body": "\n        The WNBA made enough money in 2025 to trigger revenue sharing for the first time in league history, the Women's National Basketball Players Association told ESPN on Monday. The 13 teams that played last season will receive a total of $8 million to disperse to players. It's unclear how much revenue the league made last season or the amount needed to generate revenue sharing. The WNBPA did not disclose bank statements to ESPN, and the league declined to comment. In addition, the WNBPA is set to disperse $9.25 million to players from revenue generated from licensing agreements for jersey sales, trading cards and video games, among other items, since 2020. Payments will be determined based on years played from 2020-2025, with a maximum of $50,000 for each player. The news comes amid the ongoing labor battle between the league and the players, which has lasted for more than a year and is threatening to shorten or, in a worst-case scenario, cancel the 2026 WNBA season. With less than three months until the 2026 campaign is set to tip off on May 8, the two sides have still not agreed to a new collective bargaining agreement. \n\"This shows our value and how what we're fighting for makes sense and how we should keep fighting,\" WNBPA treasurer Brianna Turner told ESPN.Later on Monday, ESPN reported that the WNBA has set a key deadline in negotiations. The league has reportedly told players that terms for a new CBA should be agreed to by March 10 (15 days from Monday) in order to avoid impacting the schedule for the 2026 season. This is the first time either side has mentioned a date as a potential negotiating deadline.\"I've been through so many cycles of collective bargaining, and often things tend to get done at the 11th hour,\" NBA commissioner Adam Silver said a press conference on Feb. 14. \"We're getting awfully close to the 11th hour now when it comes to bargaining. We need to now move towards the next-level sense of urgency and not lose momentum in terms of the amazing amount of progress we've seen in women's basketball.\"\nThe revenue targets in the 2020 CBA (which officially expired in January) were based on numbers for the 2019 season and compounded 20% across the subsequent seasons, but the COVID-19 pandemic shortened the 2020 season to 22 games and the 2021 season to 32 games. As a result, revenue sharing was thought to be extremely under the most recent CBA. Per the 2020 CBA, players would receive 50% of shared revenue (amount of revenue over a pre-determeined threshold, minus 30% for expenses). In 2025, the players' portion of the shared revenue was $16 million, the WNBPA told ESPN. Of that $16 million, $8 million will go to players who were active in 2025 and $8 million will be used for league marketing agreements. Revenue sharing remains the biggest obstacle to a new CBA. The WNBPA is fighting for a share of gross revenue, while the league is still offering a share of net revenue -- that is, the revenue remaining when league-specified operating expenses are removed from the pot.\nThe WNBPA's most recent proposal would see the players receive an average of 27.5% of the gross revenue over the course of the agreement (with a $9.5 million salary cap in 2026), sources familiar with the negotiations confirmed to CBS Sports. The league's most recent prosposal would offer the players 70% of net revenue over the course of the deal (with a $5.65 million salary cap in 2026). Last month, the WNBA announced the full schedule for the 2026 season. Training camps are scheduled to begin on April 19, with preseason games to begin on April 25 and opening night set for May 8. With just over two months until training camps are supposed to open, the two sides not only have to come to terms on a new CBA, but hold a double expansion draft for the Toronto Tempo and Portland Fire, and conduct the busiest free agency period in league history.\n\"Time is of the essence,\" WNBPA vice president Breanna Stewart told CBS Sports earlier this month. \"I think that both sides are very aware that this has gone on way longer than it needed to. But hopefully we can really start to be hearing each other and they hear us on things that are non-negotiables.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The PGA Florida Swing gets underway on Thursday with the 2026 Cognizant Classic in the Palm Beaches at the PGA National Champion Course. Coming off two Signature Events, the Cognizant Classic field is missing some of the top names on tour, but it does feature past major winners such as Shane Lowry and Brooks Koepka, who is playing in his third event since rejoining the PGA this season. The latest 2026 Cognizant Classic odds via FanDuel Sportsbook list Lowry as the +1400 favorite, followed by Ryan Gerard at +1900. Koepka is +2700 after missing the cut in his last prior event, the WM Phoenix Open. Before locking in any 2026 Cognizant Classic picks, or making any PGA DFS picks on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, simulated every PGA Tour event 10,000 times and reveals golf betting picks that have a history of being extremely profitable. This same model has also nailed a whopping 16 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- as well as this year's PGA Championship and Open Championship.

Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard. 2026 Cognizant Classic predictions One major surprise the model is calling for at the Cognizant Classic 2026: Lowry, the favorite this week and the 2019 Open Championship winner, doesn't even crack the top 3. He's a golfer to fade this week. Lowry hasn't won an individual event on the PGA Tour since that major championship, though he did team up with Rory McIlroy to win the Zurich Classic of New Orleans in 2024. Lowry finished T8 at Pebble Beach earlier this month, but that marked his first top-10 finish since May of 2025. See who else to fade here. Another surprise: The model is extremely high on Daniel Berger as a +3000 longshot, saying he's a top-six contender despite not being in the top 10 on the odds board. Berger struggled in his past two events, though he does have a pair of top-20 finishes this season -- one at the Sony Open and another at the WM Phoenix Open. He has three top-five finishes at this event, which used to be known as the Honda Classic, including one in 2022. See who else to pick here. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $100 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your first $5+ bet wins:How to make 2026 Cognizant Classic picksThe model is also targeting four other longshots with odds of +3000 or higher as top-10 contenders. You can only see the model's picks here. Who will win the 2026 Cognizant Classic, and which massive longshots will stun the golfing world?

    "body": "\n        The Army-Navy Game, which has been held on the second Saturday of December since 2009, has been at the center of recent discussions with regard to College Football Playoff expansion and scheduling due to its unique placement on the regular-season schedule. In a departure from recent tradition, Army coach Jeff Monken said he would like to see the historic rivalry game move up a week to pave the way for the CFP to start earlier.The rivalry series, dubbed \"America's Game,\" holds its contests the week after conference championship games to retain its own timeslot. The pageantry and tradition involved with one of college football's most storied rivalries has long justified the separate window. But amid calls for the season to wrap up earlier than late-January, Monken said moving the Army-Navy Game back to Thanksgiving weekend is necessary.\"There's not an appetite for the college football season to go all the way to the end of January,\" Monken said to The Athletic. \"There's a real hope that we can get this thing into one semester, and have the championship game around Jan. 1, which I think would be awesome.\"Because the CFP avoids broadcast competition with the NFL and prioritizes giving teams a full week between games, the playoff schedule for the next two years comes with lengthy layoffs (nearly two weeks between rounds) and national championship games scheduled for Jan. 25 and Jan. 24. Playoff expansion from four teams to 12 only led to the season extending deeper into the winter.If the Army-Navy Game were to move back to Thanksgiving weekend, or even to conference championship week, the CFP could begin a week earlier and thus prevent such late winter championship games.\nAny proposal to move the annual contest from its protected window would likely receive pushback. President Donald Trump last month said that he plans to sign an executive order which would prevent any football games from going head-to-head with the Army-Navy Game. That came after the now-defunct LA Bowl kicked off a half hour after the start of the 2025 installment.\"I think Army-Navy is a huge part of the history of college football, and what it is today, even,\" Monken said. \"Give us a four-hour block on Thanksgiving, or on Friday of Thanksgiving, or on Saturday of Thanksgiving, and give us a four-hour block, and just say nobody else plays during this four-hour block. That's still protecting the game.\"The Army-Navy series began in 1890, and the football game has been contested every year since 1930. Navy holds a 64-55-7 all-time advantage and won the last two meetings, including a 17-16 thriller last season.\nCBS Sports has held the broadcast rights for the Army-Navy Game since 1996 and will continue to air the game on its networks through 2038. The 2026 meeting will take place on Dec. 12 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, as part of commemorating the 25th anniversary of 9/11. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Boston Celtics star Jaylen Brown led all scorers in Sunday's 111-89 road rout of the Los Angeles Lakers with 32 points, and his performance prompted LeBron James to speak up for him as an NBA MVP candidate. While Brown ranks fourth in the league in scoring and is the face of a surprisingly successful Celtics squad, he stands behind numerous stars in the award race, and that is a reality that James cannot get behind.This has been a career year for Brown, whose 29.2 points per game are by far a personal high and who leads the league in field goal attempts per game.\"JB is playing great basketball, man,\" James said after the rivalry game. \"This whole MVP thing, I don't understand why his name is not getting talked about some, as well. Nobody gave them a shot to start the season. He's averaging, what, 30? Just under 30. It's a popularity contest sometimes.\"The only knock against Brown's production is that he is less efficient than some of his elite counterparts. His usage rate has spiked this year as he flourished into the Celtics' ringleader with Jayson Tatum out with a torn Achilles. Because his increased workload is such a large catalyst behind his elevated play, he ranks No. 12 in the NBA's efficiency metric, well behind the premier MVP contenders.That, and Brown's lack of superstar pedigree, are likely the most to blame for his sixth-place standing in the MVP race, per FanDuel odds.\nNBA MVP oddsShai Gilgeous-Alexander, Thunder (-145)Nikola Jokić, Nuggets (+270)Cade Cunningham, Pistons (+650)Victor Wembanyama, Spurs (+2500)Luka Dončić, Lakers (+4000)Jaylen Brown, Celtics (+5000)Jaylen Brown's value goes beyond career-best scoring outputWhile Brown cannot compete with the likes of Jokić, Dončić and Gilgeous-Alexander from an efficiency standpoint, the value he brings to the Celtics is undeniably important for a team that seeks to contend in what was supposed to be a down year.In past years he was a prominent wingman to Tatum, but this season, Brown has proven an ability to put a franchise on his shoulders and lead it to championship contention. The Celtics are second in the Eastern Conference, while preseason projected win totals suggested they should have been in firm danger of missing the playoffs.\"I think he's just using motivation of a lot of people saying that they're going to have a down year because of JT being out, them losing Jrue [Holiday],\" James said. \"Al [Horford] leaves. [Kristaps] Porziņģis leaves. Their whole championship team pretty much is revamped. He uses that as motivation to keep them afloat. They're playing great basketball, and it's because of him and the rest of those guys. He's taken that next step.\"\nWhat's more, Brown has been highly available, playing 51 of the Celtics' 56 games. That is more than any of the MVP candidates who stand ahead of him on the odds board.\n            ",

He joined the Chargers ahead of the 2024 season on a two-year deal and was set to become a free agent this offseason. Bozeman started in 33 of the Chargers' 34 regular-season games over the past two years but struggled in 2025, finishing last in Pro Football Focus' center grades.\nChargers set to overhaul offensive lineWith Bozeman retiring, left guard Zion Johnson hitting free agency and right guard Mekhi Becton coming off a disappointing first season in Los Angeles, the Chargers are in line to make major moves among their offensive line, which was among the NFL's worst in 2025.Chargers OL who played at least 500 snaps in 2025PFF position rankOT Jamaree SalyerT-55th out of 70OT Trey Pipkins67th out of 70OT Bobby Hart68th out of 70OT Austin Deculus70th out of 70OG Zion Johnson47th out of 66OG Trevor Penning56th out of 66OG Mekhi Becton65th out of 66C Bradley Bozeman34th out of 34The Chargers finished 31st in pass blocking and 32nd in run blocking in Pro Football Focus' grades.\n        \n            \n                Justin Herbert still hasn't won a playoff game.

The Chargers also have the 22nd pick in the NFL Draft.\nJustin Herbert took 54 sacks -- one shy of the league lead -- and was pressured on an NFL-high 42.8% of his dropbacks in 2025.\n            ",

Between now and then is the small matter of rounding out the field for the last 16. For plenty of the big sides there is work to do with Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid holding onto one goal leads and Atletico Madrid licking their wounds after a 3-3 draw.The biggest pressure is on the Serie A giants however. Last year's finalists Inter returned from Bodo/Glimt having been utterly chastened in a 3-1 loss that has their Champions League hopes on the brink. Juventus' might already have slipped off their after they were obliterated by Galatasaray, whose star forward is where we'll kick all of this off.Get ready for the Knockout Stage like never before with the UEFA Champions League Bracket Games!

Is Osimhen a top five striker in the world?Without wishing to state the obvious, the very best center forwards in the world tend to be the ones who score the most. You might get the odd Roberto Firmino type whose qualities lie in facilitation, but if you wear the No. 9 shirt (or one whose digits add up to nine), you'd best be putting the ball in the onion bag. Move to the very best of the very best, though, and you enter the class of players who can deliver all the goals you need but still, on those rare off days, bend a big contest to their will without scoring. A prime reference point for that might be Victor Osimhen's obliterating of Juventus in a 5-2 win that will almost certainly have Galatasaray in the last 16 of the Champions League for the first time in 12 years.\nWhat was funny about the devastation wrought by Osimhen on his former boss Luciano Spalletti was that it really didn't show up on a cursory glance at the stats sheet. Three shots for 0.13 xG, 11 of 18 passes completed, no chances created. You're telling me this is the guy you're considering placing behind Erling Haaland and Kylian Mbappe in the pantheon of center forwards, maybe on a par with Ousmane Dembele and Harry Kane? Dig a little deeper though and you see something. Ten touches in the opposition box is usually the sort of number a Champions League striker registers when they're on the positive end of a severe talent mismatch. The 0.41 expected assists is pretty sprightly too, though Opta does not have any assists logged for the Nigerian international. Check UEFA's data and you will find two and it was those moments that typified the chaos Osimhen created both before and after Juventus went down to 10 men. His pressing was ferocious, his commitment in the duels relentless. Gabriel Sara's opener would not have come about if Osimhen hadn't sensed a heavy touch by Kenan Yildiz and hit him hard. Galatasaray's fourth is the poacher's instinct of a striker reinterpreted for when the other team has possession. Lurking on the blind side, waiting for the moment when Juventus think they can breath because the initial wave of pressure has crashed against them. They never see Osimhen coming.\nSuch elite off ball play tends to be one of the first things that goes when strikers enter the pantheon of the best on earth. So many reason that they need to save their energy for what they do best. You would figure the intensity would drop off even more when a player moves out of Europe's top five leagues to the sort of environment he can dominate at 80% energy. And yet Osimhen averages an incredibly impressive 1.75 interceptions per 90 minutes in the Super Lig this season, four times what Mbappe, for instance, does for Real Madrid in league play. It translates on the European stage too. Only eight players win possession in the attacking third more frequently than Osimhen has in this season's Champions League. All that is to say nothing for how he holds possession when he gets it, bringing others into play.As for the thing that really matters for strikers, you know that Osimhen delivers on that front. Perhaps not quite with the consistency of last year but 15 goals in 23 games is not to be sniffed at, all the more so when six of them have come in the Champions League. There might not have been any in his last four games but there is no shame in struggling to find the net against Manchester City and Atletico Madrid, particularly when even after Galatasaray's recent aggressive investment they are not a club that can go toe to toe with those sides on talent terms.So Osimhen then is quite clearly one of Europe's outstanding strikers, right? Well probably, when he's fit. That has been the recurring problem for the 27-year-old, who missed the weekend's defeat to Konyaspor with a knee injury. He is said to be a doubt for the trip to Turin too, albeit he is expected to travel. Per Transfermarkt, this was the eighth separate injury he has suffered since leaving Napoli, initially on loan, at the start of last season. They say availability is the best ability. Whether that is or isn't the case (it isn't), it might be the only one a striker needs that Osimhen is missing.\n2. Can Bodo/Glimt see out their upset on the road?So, how much of Bodo/Glimt's stunning 3-1 win over Inter was down to what is probably the most significant home field advantage in the Champions League this season. The artificial turf and freezing temperatures have been a pretty helpful swing factor against not just Inter but Manchester City, Lazio and Porto in the last 18 months. Since the start of the 2020-21 season, Bodo/Glimt have a European record at the Aspmyra Stadion that can stand up against all but the continent's superteams: 19 wins, two draws and nine defeats. That's a smidge under two points per game. Their opponents, twice Champions League finalists in that same time period, average exactly two.And so Bodo/Glimt's win was one we might have seen coming, but was it enough? Because as good as the Norwegian champions are at home, their road record is pretty abysmal: seven wins, 14 draws and 19 defeats. Most notably they seem to struggle when travelling for knockout games. There are isolated periods of success, winning against Celtic in Glasgow and getting the result they needed away to AZ in the 2021-22 Conference League. The following year the giants of Bohemians and Pyunik fell at home to Bodo/Glimt but not a lot else. Across their last 40 away European matches a goal difference of -20 is bad but it could have been so much worse, their non-penalty xG difference is -29.36. Historically they're three-quarters of a goal per game worse than their opponents on the road and most of those opponents are not Inter.So historically Bodo/Glimt have the look of a team that could very plausibly cede a two goal lead to a European juggernaut. But this isn't 2021-22 Bodo/Glimt. Their money-spinning runs through the Europa League have not only allowed this club to recruit and retain Norwegian stars like Frederik Bjorkan and Kasper Hogh, but to bring back the likes of Patrick Berg and Jens Petter Hauge after moves to the big five leagues. As their manager Kjetil Knutsen explained, this is a team that have only improved from their many trips across the continent.\n\"I really believe in our identity and in the work we do over time,\" he said. \"That [way] it becomes second nature, there's loyalty, and a culture where we trust the quality we have within the team. We've also been extremely fortunate because we've been in the Europa [League] over a sustained period, facing stronger and stronger opposition. Both personally and as a [coaching] team, we've trusted the process.\"The current iteration shouldn't be written off as just a side who do the business at home. Kjetil Knutsen's men took five points on their travels in the league phase, the memorable win against Atletico Madrid following draws at Borussia Dortmund and Slavia Prague, the latter a fighting performance to overturn a two goal deficit in the final 12 minutes. Most worryingly of all for Inter, Bodo/Glimt are proving themselves to be a team who can execute in the particular scenario ahead of them. Four of their 17 goals in this season's Champions League have come on the counter attack, a tally bettered only by Real Madrid and they average a breakout that ends in a shot once per game. If they can just convert that moment when it comes their way, they will set Inter an almighty task.3. Will Mbappe break Ronaldo's single season scoring record?Even with the new Champions League format exposing players to as many as four extra games in the competition, it feels remarkable that before spring has sprung Kylian Mbappe finds himself so close to what once seemed an unbreakable Champions League record. The 17 goals that Cristiano Ronaldo hammered home in the 2013-14 competition included a healthy dose of group stage output against lesser opposition and some thundering beatdowns on the likes of Schalke, Bayern Munich and Atletico Madrid. Thereafter only Ronaldo got within one again and those who even sniffed it were the best striker in the world in the form of their lives (Robert Lewandowski in 2019-20 and Karim Benzema two years later).\nKylian Mbappe might be the first of those things, only time will tell if the latter is true. What he is not, for the moment at least, is at the head of an all-conquering attack like those led by Lewandowski, Benzema and Ronaldo. Even so he needs just four more goals to match the single season scoring record in this competition.\n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            You suspect a player averaging 5.7 shots and 0.73 non-penalty xG per 90 will back himself to add a few more against Benfica this week, who have given up nine shots to Mbappe in two games so far in the competition. What bodes best for him in this Champions League iteration is that he has had that very Ronaldo-ish quality of scoring in bunches: two against Monaco, three on Kairat, four against Olympiacos.The only question is whether Madrid can go far enough in this competition to allow Mbappe to get up to and ahead of his predecessor. Much will depend on Friday's draw, assuming Los Merengues are in it. If Madrid drop on Manchester City's side then we are in crapshoot territory, two sides that have hardly inspired great faith in their Champions League chops duking it out once more in games that are reliably incomprehensible. The other option though is Sporting and while any team that has beaten PSG and won in Bilbao will deserve Madrid's respect, they will also have plenty to fear from an in form Mbappe. Get this guy to the quarterfinals and he might already have delivered the greatest scoring season this competition has seen.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Phoenix Suns have been one of the NBA's best stories this season, and Dillon Brooks has been at the heart of it. He's scoring at a rate (and in ways) we've never seen from him before on any kind of a consistent basis. He's defending, as always. His competitive prints are all over one of the grittiest teams in the league. And now he has a broken hand.There are bummers and there are bummers. This is the latter. Here's to hoping Brooks can get back in time for the playoffs/Play-In tournament (ESPN reports he'll be out 4-6 weeks), but in the meantime the Suns, who are also without Devin Booker (hip strain) for at least the next week, need to find a way to replace at least some of Brooks' 21 points per game. The natural next man for that job would be Jalen Green, who also came over from Houston with Brooks in the Kevin Durant trade. You're forgiven if you forgot Green even played for the Suns. He's missed most of the season with a hamstring issue that has refused to fully repair. But he's back and healthy (for) now. He had 26 points and four 3-pointers against San Antonio coming out of the All-Star break. On Saturday, he made up for a miserable shooting night by knocking down a fading corner 3 at the buzzer to beat the Magic in overtime. \nGreen is an electric athlete who had a legitimate superstar stretch last season in Houston, but he's never been a consistent shooter or anything close to an efficient scorer on the whole. He's only 24, but he's making $33.5 million. Next year that number rises to $36.2 million, and the year after that he has a $36 million player option as the first player to ever sign a 2+1 rookie extension on a nine-figure contract. It's a lot of money if Green doesn't pan out. But if he does, it has a chance to become a team-friendly deal. He's not going to defend like Brooks, if at all. He's not going to go to work in the post. But he'll never have a better opportunity to prove his value than right now, with the Suns badly in need of anyone who can contribute to the cause of recreating Brooks' production in the aggregate, particularly as a self creator. One of the notable strides Brooks has made this year is as a guy who can get buckets on his own; over 55% of his field goals have been unassisted. For better or worse, this is what Green does. Last season 63% of his non-garbage-time buckets were unassisted (that was the highest percentage for any wing in the league, per Cleaning the Glass). \nAgain, it's never been efficient. And so far it hasn't been with the Suns. On Sunday, Green cooked up a donut in the first half of Phoenix's loss to Portland and finished 1 of 7 from 3. So far this season he's averaging 13.3 points and shooting 38% from the field over 10 games. Small and randomized sample notwithstanding, that's obviously not going to cut it. \nBut don't be fooled, there is a big-time-scorer version of Jalen Green that is going to come out, and the Suns need it to be sooner than later. The dream of him turning into the actual superstar his talent theoretically suggests he could be is almost surely dead, but the question remains whether he can be winning player on a winning team. We've seen in in stretches, but the Rockets, all told, were more than eight points per 100 possessions better with him off the floor last season, per CTG. He's probably regarded as a negative asset at this point with $70 million in guaranteed money still on the books, but winning looks good on everyone. He's playing for another contract, be it in Phoenix or elsewhere. \nThese next six weeks aren't do-or-die for Green; he'll have a big opportunity next season, as well. But it has to start now. NBA perceptions can become sort of irreversible at some point, and Green is toeing that line as the dreaded empty-stats scorer. It just so happens that the Suns -- who are just two games back of the No. 6 Timberwolves with one head-to-head remaining and the tiebreaker already secured, but are also just two games up on the No. 8 Warriors -- are not in a position to consider any scoring stat empty without Brooks. They scored 77 points on Sunday. They need every bucket they can get. And if there's one thing Green can do, it's get buckets. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Amid an otherwise quiet period in the NFL calendar, the combine breaks the ice (often literally and figuratively) and shakes up draft boards two months ahead of the draft.The National Invitational Camp began in 1982, and by 1985 it served as the one central location to assess prospects. By 1987, it moved to Indianapolis, where it's been ever since.It's an intensive job interview. In addition to the physical testing, players interview with teams and media, undergo medical examinations and participate in a variety of other tests.\n        \n            \n                Biggest need for every NFL team entering the combine: DL in the NFC North, priorities for new head coaches\n                \n                    Josh Edwards                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhile the on-field portion is sometimes derisively referred to as the \"underwear Olympics,\" it's also a key chance for players to show off their skills and potentially boost their stock. Though it's far from the only thing -- and, in many cases, far from the most important thing -- that goes on at the combine, it is the most transparent portion for the viewing public; over five million people watched across the four days last year. And let's not forget: speed, strength, agility and explosiveness still make up a huge part of the sport. While strong performances can boost draft stock, poor performances can no only lower draft stock but also potentially show major flaws in a player's game.\nHere's a look at the best performances in all of the events going back to 2006, when the most widely available and comprehensive data is available. The NFL does not keep official combine records.40-yard dashXavier Worthy (2024) -- 4.21 secondsJohn Ross (2017) -- 4.22 secondsKalon Barnes (2022) -- 4.23 secondsChris Johnson (2008) -- 4.24 secondsDJ Turner II (2023), Riq Woolen (2022), Dri Archer (2014) -- 4.26 secondsWorthy thrilled the crowd two years ago when he blazed to the fastest 40-yard dash in combine history. Unofficially ruled a 4.22 initially, the official time was one one-hundredth of a second faster. The Texas product ended up going to the Chiefs in the first round two months later.\nVertical jump1. Chris Conley (2015), Donald Washington (2009): 45\"3. Donovan Peoples-Jones (2020), Byron Jones (2015): 44.5\"5. Quan Martin (2023), Juan Thornhill (2019), Obi Melifonwu (2017), A.J. Jefferson (2010): 44\"\nJones had an all-time combine in 2015, and his 44.5\" vertical was only part of it. Still, he wasn't even the best jumper that year, with Conley's 45\" leap tying Washington's record from six years earlier. Gerald Sensabaugh jumped 46\" in 2005, just outside our range.Broad jumpByron Jones (2015): 12'3\"Tyler Owens (2024): 12'2\"Emanuel Hall (2019), Juan Thornhill (2019), Obi Melifonwu (2017): 11'9\"Jones' 12'3\" broad jump was not just a combine record, but a world record.\nJones ended up being a first-round pick of the Cowboys, and he played seven years in the NFL.3-cone drillJordan Thomas (2018): 6.28 secondsSedrick Curry (2000): 6.34 secondsJeff Maehl (2011): 6.42 secondsBuster Skrine (2011): 6.44 secondsDavid Long Jr. (2019), Scott Long (2010): 6.45 secondsThe 3-cone drill has been less and less popular of late, and the fastest player last year was Tez Johnson at 6.65 seconds. Thomas never played in the NFL.\n20-yard shuttle1. Brandin Cooks (2014), Jason Allen (2006): 3.81 seconds3. Bobby McCain (2015): 3.82 seconds4. B.W. Webb (2013): 3.84 seconds5. Justin Simmons (2016), Desmond Trufant (2013): 3.85 secondsAnother agility drill that has largely gone by the wayside, the 20-yard shuttle didn't feature a single player under 4.03 seconds last year. Cooks' and Allen's shared mark appears safe for now -- and maybe forever. In 2004, Dunta Robinson ran a 3.75, which is the all-time record per ESPN.Bench press1. Stephen Paea (2011): 49 reps2. Mitch Petrus (2010), Mike Kudla (2006): 45 reps4. Netane Muti (2020), Dontari Poe (2012), Jeff Owens (2010), Brodrick Bunkley (2006): 44 reps\nGive it up for the big guys in the trenches. On a week where speed, agility and explosiveness draw the most headlines, the bench press is the one place for the linemen to shine, and Paea certainly did so in 2011.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Jaxon Smith-Njigba picked the perfect time to have the best season of his career. The NFL's reigning Offensive Player of the Year led the league in receiving yards in 2025 during a career season that saw him go off for 1,793 yards and 10 touchdown catches. The timing couldn't have been better for the Seahawks star, who just finished his third NFL season, which means he's now eligible to get a contract extension for the first time. Smith-Njigba, who was selected with the 23rd overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft, has developed into one of the top receivers in the NFL and he definitely wants to be paid like one of the top receivers. During a recent interview with Jonah Javad of WFAA, the 24-year-old was asked if wants to be the highest paid receiver in the NFL and he didn't hesitate with his answer. \"I think, I believe I deserve to be the highest paid in my position, just what I give to the game and the community, I give it my all,\" JSN said. \"I think that's worth a lot.\"\nSmith-Njigba made just $1.55 million in base salary last season during the third year of his rookie deal and he's only scheduled to make $2.72 million in 2026 (He signed a four-year, $14.42 million rookie deal that included a $7.49 million signing bonus), so he's certainly underpaid. After his huge 2025 season, he's clearly looking for a raise. So what does that mean for the Seahawks? Glad you asked. Let's check out the receiver market. Highest-paid receivers in the NFLThe NFL's highest-paid receiver right now is Ja'Marr Chase, who signed a four-year, $161 million contract extension back in March. Chase's deal pays him an average of $40.25 million per year, so if Smith-Njigba is looking to top that number, that means he's aiming to get $40.3 million per year at the minimum.\nThe second-highest paid receiver in the NFL is Minnesota's Justin Jefferson, who's pulling in an average of $35 million per year. There's a huge gap between Chase and Jefferson and it's possible the Seahawks could try to fit Smith-Njigba's new contract number somewhere in there, but with JSN saying \"I deserve to be the highest paid,\" there may not be a lot of wiggle room. This could be a situation where the Seahawks either agree to pay him what he's asking for or things could get contentious. The Seahawks will also likely need to include more than $110 million in guaranteed money to top both Chase and Jefferson in that department. The Seahawks do have Smith-Njigba under contract for one more year (2026), plus a potential fifth-year option in 2027 on top of that, so they could conceivably kick the can until next offseason. Yes, JSN wants to get paid, but he doesn't seem to be in a hurry. \"I'm really not too pressed right now to get it done,\" Smith-Njigba said. \"I know my time is coming and when we get it done it's gonna be a great deal. And, you know, God's timing is perfect timing. So, whenever that may come, we'll be ready for it.\"\nBasically, a deal could certainly get done this season, but there's also a chance that it would take until next offseason. One big reason why Smith-Njigba might be willing to wait is because the receiver market could be going up in the next few months, which takes us to our next topic. Why the Rams should be paying close attentionAs things currently stand, there are only really two players who have any shot of resetting the receiving market over the next 12 months. One of them is Smith-Njigba and the other one is Puka Nacua. The Rams receiver has been one of the biggest bargains in NFL history over the past three years. During the 2025 season, he made just $1.03 million in base salary under the terms of his rookie contract and that will go up to just $5.66 million in 2026. Although JSN's rookie contract could technically keep him tied to Seattle until 2027, the Rams are in a more pressing situation with Nacua. Since he was taken in the fifth-round, there's no fifth-year option with his contract. His deal expires after the 2026 season, so the Rams need to get something done now (or they could face a situation where they're forced to hit him with the franchise tag next year). \nNacua led the NFL in yards per game (107.2) and receptions in 2025 (129). He's also averaged 104.3 catches per year during his three NFL seasons. Rams general manager Les Snead is well aware that his team is going to have to pay Nacua a boatload of money in the very near future.  \"If you're one of the best at what you do and obviously he's evolved into one of the best things, that's a pretty simple contract because it's pretty self-explanatory where you fall in the ecosystem and the hierarchy,\" Snead said in early February. The Rams general manager also added that he's hoping to negotiate a win-win contract with Nacua so that the Rams have some money left over to pay other guys. \n\"There are also so many variables,\" Snead said of negotiating this type of contract. \"There are other players whose contracts are up. Maybe there are so many variables that go into to that make it more complex than it would seem on the surface level. Similar to a few players we've had in the past that have been at that level in the ecosystem, you have to begin communication and begin working through it to come up with win-win solution.\"The Nacua negotiation and the Smith-Njigba negotiation are almost certainly going to have an impact on each other, which is why the Rams will be paying close attention to the Seahawks and the Seahawks will be paying close attention to the Rams. If Nacua gets a deal first that makes him the highest-paid receiver in the NFL, then Smith-Njigba will likely turn around and look to top that number. If JSN gets his deal first, then Nacua may look to top that number, and due to that dynamic, that would explain why Smith-Njigba isn't in any rush to get his deal done. If Nacua gets his new contrac first, that will likely mean even more money for JSN. In this case, being patient could pay off big for Smith-Njigba. \nOf course, the Seahawks could always try and talk JSN into playing for nothing, which he almost seems open to. Almost. \"I would play this game for free,\" Smith-Njigba said on WFAA. \"I love this game so much, but you don't have to [play for free]. I'm learning to be a good businessman and we need that check at the end of the day.\"If Smith-Njigba gets an extension done this offseason, his next check could end up being worth more than his entire rookie contract. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2028 Summer Olympics are still two years away, but athletes are already confirming that they intend to compete when Los Angeles serves as host. Four-time Olympic gold medalist Kevin Durant is one of those athletes, as he told ESPN that he has every intention to compete at the 2028 Games.\"Hell yeah, I want to play,\" Durant said. \"I would love to, but I've got to stay on top of my game. I'm not expecting, I want to produce on the floor and make Grant [Hill] and whoever is making the decisions, want to put me on the team. I don't want -- not just for seniority. I want to still prove I can help the team win.\"Durant will be just two months shy of turning 40 when the 2028 Summer Olympics happen, but if he maintains the level of play that we've seen this season over the next two years, there would be no reason to not include him on the Olympic roster.Health will certainly be a major factor in the matter, but Durant's been durable in each of the last three seasons including the current one, and if that trend keeps, he should be a no-brainer to make the roster. The way Durant plays lends itself to aging well in the NBA, and we've seen that in the years since he tore his Achilles in 2019. He's been an All-Star in six of the seven years since that injury cost him a full season in the NBA, and the outlier year was because he was limited to 39 games due to injury.\nDurant earning a roster spot on Team USA isn't the surprising part, it's that he still wants to compete in the Olympics. There was an assumption that the 2024 Paris Games would be the final year he, LeBron James and Stephen Curry would all compete with Team USA. James has already said publicly that he doesn't plan on suiting up for the 2028 Games. Curry hasn't said if he'll play, but he'll also be 40 by then.But Durant is letting us know that we were all wrong with that line of thinking.\"You guys, the media, have projected that,\" Durant said. \"That narrative, where did the last dance thing come from? I didn't say I wasn't playing. LeBron said he wasn't. You didn't hear that from me or Steph.\"For now we can pencil Durant's name in for the 2028 Olympic roster, which will certainly see some turnover with all the aging stars likely not participating. Cade Cunningham stated his desire to play in the 2028 Olympics in a recent GQ profile, while making the bold statement that he thinks he's the best American player. And will get some holdovers like Anthony Edwards, Jayson Tatum and Tyrese Haliburton, as well as several of the younger players who are just starting out like Rookie of the Year frontrunners Cooper Flagg and Kon Knueppel.\nTeam USA certainly won't be short on talent to pick from, but there's already this narrative that other countries are starting to catch up with them. The men's basketball team has won a gold medal in each of the last five Olympic Games, as they've been the far superior team in most cases in Olympic history. There's only been three times the U.S. men's basketball team hasn't won gold since 1936, so it's been an incredibly dominant run for them in the sport for a very long time.However, at the 2024 Games, teams like Serbia and France did put up a good fight against Team USA, and Canada's talent pool just continues to deepen with each passing year. The talent gap isn't as wide as it once was, but Durant thinks it's being overblown.\"I just don't like the talk around the USA versus European style of how you approach the game,\" Durant said. \"All I hear is, 'AAU is destroying the game; the Euros do it right while the Americans do it wrong.'\" \nDurant went on to talk about how he feels the conversation feels a bit racially charged in the way its discussed.\"It's a lot of bullshit with that,\" Durant said. \"I can read between the lines on that. It's a shot at Black Americans. We're controlling the sport. They're tired of us controlling the sport. 'France is coming for you.' Really? We smacked them boys.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Just because you don't get the call to Indianapolis doesn't mean the league isn't watching. Recent history is littered with \"snubs\" who turned that oversight into motivation and, ultimately, productive NFL careers.Every year, a handful of prospects shine at the college all-star games or on tape all fall and still don't end up among the 300-plus invites to the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis. That doesn't mean they're off the radar. More often, it simply means the evaluation process looks different for seniors than it does for underclassmen.So why do good players get overlooked in the first place? Part of it is simple math. As former podcaster-turned-Jets front-office executive Rick Spielman explained on the \"With the First Pick\" podcast back in 2023, teams have a limited number of combine spots and often prioritize underclassmen they haven't met in person, while seniors get extensive exposure at all-star events and through the fall scouting cycle. In other words, a missing invite is often about logistics, not a lack of NFL interest.\"As a general manager, we always made the point that the Senior Bowl, the East-West Shrine Bowl, and all these all-star games where the seniors are going to show up -- let's get as much work as we can get done there with the interview process and the testing so that when we get to the combine, we can focus on the juniors we haven't gotten in front of at all.\"\nThe list of combine snubs is long and impressiveHistorically, as my colleague Garrett Podell wrote back in 2024, names like Chris Harris, Malcolm Butler, Adam Thielen, Julian Edelman, Wes Welker, James Harrison and Antonio Gates -- for one reason or another -- didn't get invited to Indy and went on to careers that included Super Bowls, Super Bowl MVPs and the Pro Football Hall of Fame.Even going back a few years, the success stories remain easy to find. Let's start with some standouts, then take a look back at recent history.Phillip Lindsay, RB, signed by the Broncos. He went undrafted out of Colorado and became the first undrafted offensive rookie in NFL history to make the Pro Bowl, rushing for 1,037 yards and nine touchdowns in 2018.Bryce Huff, EDGE, signed by the Jets. He went undrafted out of Memphis, developed into one of the league's most efficient pass rushers (10 sacks in 2023) and signed a $51 million contract with the Eagles in 2024.Ja'Quan McMillian, CB, signed by the Broncos. Undrafted out of East Carolina -- and considered a notable combine snub at the time -- McMillian spent the 2022 season on the practice squad before emerging as one of the league's top nickel backs, including in 2023, when he led all cornerbacks in tackles for loss.Kobie Turner, DL, drafted by the Rams. A third-round pick out of Wake Forest, he emerged as one of the league's premier interior pass rushers, leading all NFL rookies with 9.0 sacks in 2023.Elijah Ponder, EDGE, signed by the Patriots. Undrafted out of Cal Poly, he was one of three rookie UDFAs to make the Patriots' initial 53-man roster in 2025 despite playing at the FCS level and not receiving a combine invite. Ponder finished the regular season with four sacks, four tackles for loss and two fumble recoveries -- then added a critical fumble recovery in the AFC Championship Game to help New England reach the Super Bowl.Below is a longer list of notable combine snubs, from 2018-2025.2018Russell Gage, WR, drafted by the Falcons. A sixth-round pick out of LSU, he developed into a primary target for Matt Ryan and eventually signed a three-year, $30 million contract with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.Justin Watson, WR, drafted by the Buccaneers. A fifth-round pick out of Penn (Ivy League), he transitioned from small-school standout to staple \"super-sub\" and special teams ace, winning three Super Bowl rings with the Bucs and Chiefs.Phillip Lindsay (see above)2020Kevin Dotson, OG, drafted by the Steelers. The Ragin' Cajun didn't play Power 5 football but was still a fourth-round pick and is now an important cog on the Rams' offensive line.Bryce Huff (see above)2022Isaiah Pola-Mao, DB, signed by the Raiders. Undrafted out of USC, he carved out a role on special teams before developing into a high-impact defender, recording a career-high 92 tackles, four tackles for loss and two interceptions in 2025.Kader Kohou, CB, signed by the Dolphins. Undrafted out of Division II Texas A&M-Commerce, he made the leap from small-school standout to Day 1 starter in Miami, eventually leading all undrafted rookies in snaps and passes defended in 2022.Ja'Quan McMillian (see above)2023Karl Brooks, DL, drafted by the Packers. A sixth-round pick out of Bowling Green who also had an impressive Senior Bowl week. Brooks dominated the MAC before becoming the first Packers rookie since Clay Matthews to record 4-plus sacks and multiple fumble recoveries in a single season. After his second NFL season, he joined J.J. Watt as the only players to record multiple fumble recoveries, a forced fumble and a blocked kick in back-to-back years.Kobie Turner (see above)2024Beanie Bishop Jr., DB, signed by the Steelers. Undrafted out of West Virginia despite leading the nation in pass breakups and earning second-team All-American honors, he became the first undrafted rookie in Steelers history to record four interceptions -- including a two-pick performance against Aaron Rodgers and the Jets that earned him NFL Defensive Rookie of the Month honors.2025Willie Lampkin, OC, signed by the Rams. Undrafted out of North Carolina largely because he measured just 5-foot-11 and 280 pounds -- though he certainly didn't play like it. The Legend of Willie only grew after a four-pancake preseason performance vs. the Cowboys.\nThe Rams released him before the season, but the Eagles claimed him a few days later and placed him on injured reserve.\nShaun Dolac, LB, signed by the Rams. Undrafted out of Buffalo, the All-American and nation's leading tackler in 2024 made the Rams' 53-man roster out of training camp. He played in all 17 games -- primarily on special teams -- but recorded seven tackles and a tackle for loss in his defensive debut against the Ravens in Week 6.Elijah Ponder (see above)The lesson?

So who might NFL teams be overlooking in 2026?Kaelon Black, RB, IndianaBlack projects as a downhill, north-south grinder who wins with patience, low pads and a punishing mentality between the tackles. His 213-pound frame and willingness in blitz pickup give him early rotational value in power-heavy systems.Lewis Bond, WR, Boston CollegeBond brings immediate slot utility thanks to his understanding of coverages, reliable hands and RB-like contact balance after the catch. He's at his best taking short completions and ripping off big chunks with physicality and open-field elusiveness. He's dependable and durable but lacks high-end explosiveness and may struggle to consistently separate against press-man coverage on downfield routes.\nTyren Montgomery, WR, John CarrollMontgomery's size, physicality, and contested-catch and high-point ability stand out immediately. He uses his frame to shield defenders, thrives on in-breaking routes and adds value as a perimeter blocker. He not only fit right in during Senior Bowl practices, he was one of the best players in Mobile, Alabama.Jaydn Ott, RB, OklahomaWhen healthy, Ott flashes the traits of a heady zone-scheme runner with twitchy short-area quickness and good vision. His receiving value and ability to create yards after contact give him legitimate rotational upside. The concern, however, is durability, which limited him during the 2025 season.Landon Robinson, DL, NavyRobinson plays with low pads and good leverage as a high-motor interior disruptor whose lateral agility and first-step burst make him a nightmare. He plays stronger than his 6-foot frame and shows the ability to consistently handle double teams. Fair or not, his lack of prototypical length may limit his ceiling for some teams, even if the production and motor translate.\nJames Brockermeyer, OC, MiamiA CBS Sports 2025 first-team All-American who anchored an offensive line that reached the national championship game, Brockermeyer is a technician who wins with leverage and heavy hands. He's one of the smartest offensive linemen in the class, and it wouldn't be shocking if he has a long NFL career.James Thompson Jr., DL, IllinoisA 2025 All-Big Ten standout who, at 6-foot-4 and 310 pounds, can line up anywhere along the defensive line, Thompson wins with length and a relentless motor. He flashes lateral twitch to win early in reps and the athleticism to chase down quarterbacks in the backfield. He's a power-and-leverage technician who can reset the line of scrimmage and should have a place on an NFL roster next season.\n            ",

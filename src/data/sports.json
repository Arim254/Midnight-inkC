    "body": "\n        Getting a horse to qualify for the Kentucky Derby is almost as difficult as winning it. And already this year, the road to the 2026 Kentucky Derby has seen a major withdrawal: Reigning Breeders' Cup Juvenile winner and 2-year-old champion Ted Noffey has been ruled out of all three legs of the Triple Crown because of bone bruising.Ted Noffey was the lukewarm future wager favorite for the Run for the Roses, and his absence has made an already wide-open race even more up-in-the-air. Remsen Stakes winner Paladin, who is set to run on Saturday in the 2026 Risen Star Stakes in New Orleans, is the 8-1 morning-line favorite among the 39 individual betting interests in Pool 4 of the Kentucky Derby Future Wager. The Todd Pletcher-trained Nearly, who is coming off an impressive victory in the Holy Bull Stakes, is the 10-1 second choice.  However, there are other horses that are worth considering at bigger prices in Pool 4 of the future wager, which opens at noon ET on Friday and closes at 6 p.m. ET on Sunday. Here are my top four overlays, listed in order of preference.31 Secured Freedom (90-1)After running an even fourth in his debut, this son of Practical Joke won going away in his second start, earning a solid 88 Beyer Speed Figure. Last week in the Robert B. Lewis Stakes he ran third, but the race was better than it looks on paper. He was wide on both turns and then galloped out past both of the top two finishers. He will need to get faster, but he certainly has shown the talent to do so. My biggest concern with Secured Freedom is the distance. Sons and daughters of Practical Joke do not excel beyond a mile, much less 1¼ miles. But at 90-1 or thereabouts, he's worth a sprinkle.\n38 The Puma (90-1)Though he is winless in two career starts, The Puma is arguably the most accomplished 3-year-old maiden in the country. In his career debut, he ran well but finished second to the well-regarded Chief Wallabee. Then, in the Sam F. Davis Stakes last week, he lacked room for much of the race and encountered major traffic trouble down the lane when he tried to go through a hole that wasn't there and finished third behind the talented Renegade. I'm not sure The Puma would've beaten Renegade with a fair trip, but he would've made the race much more interesting. If you like Renegade at 20-1, you have to love The Puma at 90-1. Trainer Gustavo Delgado already has won a Kentucky Derby, with Mage in 2023. 10 Commandment (25-1)Trained by Brad Cox and ridden by top jock Irad Ortiz Jr., Commandment has improved with every race and has won his last two starts, capped off by a 6¾-length romp in the Mucho Macho Man Stakes, which earned a good 91 Beyer Speed Figure. But the most impressive aspect of that race came after the wire, when he galloped out miles past the field. That suggests to me that this son of Into Mischief should have no problem stretching out in distance and going two turns, which he will do in his next start, the Fountain of Youth Stakes on Feb. 28. Now's the time to pull the trigger on this runner. 5 Canaletto (40-1)A half-brother to last year's Arkansas Derby winner, Sandman, Canaletto did not make his first career start until Jan. 25. But it was an impressive debut. He won the one-mile race by eight widening lengths and earned an 89 Beyer Speed Figure. Unlike his plodding half-brother, who was sired by Tapit, Canaletto was sired by Into Mischief and has more tactical speed. Because of his late debut, Canaletto might need to be rushed to make the Kentucky Derby, which isn't ideal, but this $1 million purchase is a horse with a future. I'm not sure you're going to get 40-1 though.\nOthers to consider: 1 Blackout Time (40-1), 13 Englishman (40-1), koming (koming-1) and koming (koming-1). 1Blackout Time40-12Boyd40-13Brant20-14Bravaro80-15Canaletto40-16Carson Street75-17Chief Wallabee20-18Chip Honcho90-19Class President90-110Commandment25-111Courting90-112Emerging Market30-113Englishman40-114Ewing50-115Further Ado25-116Golden Tempo20-117Intrepido30-118Iron Honor60-119Jackson Hole50-120Litmus Test40-121Mesquite75-122My World80-123Napoleon Solo25-124Nearly10-125Paladin8-126Plutarch20-127Potente50-128Powershift80-129Pyromancer80-130Renegade20-131Secured Freedom90-132Silent Tactic30-133Six Speed50-134So Happy40-135Soldier N Diplomat75-136Solitude Dude50-137Talk to Me Jimmy80-138The Puma90-139Thunderously25-140All other 3-year-olds4-1\n            ",

After finishing just 0.43 points behind the French team of Laurence Fournier Beaudry and Guillaume Cizeron, Chock called for more transparency from the judging process. In response, the International Skating Union (ISU) issued a statement defending how the judges -- particularly a judge from France -- landing on their respective scores.Following the rhythm dance portion of the event, Chock and Bates were just 0.46 points behind Beaudry and Cizeron. In the free dance portion of the event, with the Americans favored to take home gold, five of nine judges scored Chock and Bates higher than Beaudry and Cizeron. Three more gave the French a narrow edge.However, French judge Jezabel Dabouis scored the French duo more than seven points higher than the Americans -- a wide margin. In the end, Beaudry and Cizeron won the event by just 0.43 points. Despite some criticism of the judging process, the ISU said a wide range of scores across multiple judges is normal.\"It is normal for there to be a range of scores given by different judges in any panel and a number of mechanisms are used to mitigate these variations,\" the ISU said, per the Associated Press, adding it has \"full confidence in the scores given and remains completely committed to fairness.\"\n\n        \n            \n                2026 Winter Olympics medal count: Keep track of Team USA's quest for gold in Italy\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIn an interview with CBS News, Chock said more transparency would benefit the skaters and fans. She also called for more thorough vetting of the judges.\"I think it would definitely be helpful if it's more understandable for the viewers to see more transparent judging and understand what's really going on,\" Chock said. \"It's also important for the skaters that the judges be vetted and reviewed and that they are also putting out their best performance. There's a lot on the line for the skaters when they're out there giving it their all. We also deserve to have the judges giving it their all and for it to be a fair and even playing field.\"\nWhile Chock and Bates took home a bittersweet silver medal in the ice dance event, they did pick up a gold medal earlier in the Olympics with a victory in team figure skating.\n            \n    ",

His arrival at a guesthouse led to an alert to police, who arrested him Wednesday and brought him to the central San Vittore prison where he faces a sentence of 11 months and seven days for those crimes committed 16 years ago, per a statement from the Carabinieri police force (via Reuters).The man, whose name was not made public, was arrested prior to Slovakia's opening 4-1 win against Finland, which meant he did not get to watch his home nation triumph in a major preliminary round upset. \n\n        \n            \n                2026 Winter Olympics: Team USA men's hockey schedule, results as Americans try to end gold medal drought\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThere are few opportunities for fans to watch their national team play in Olympic competition, and even fewer that don't require a lengthy and expensive trip. For this man, the reward of seeing Slovakia compete in the Olympics was enough to outweigh the risk of the outstanding warrant for his arrest in Italy. His gamble didn't pay off with a trip to Milan's Santagiulia Arena to watch the hockey competition, and instead he'll serve a pending sentence of nearly a year in a Milan prison. \nIf there's any silver lining for the man, his beloved Slovakian hockey team also beat host nation Italy on Friday to improve to 2-0 in preliminary action. \n            \n    ",

The \"Great American Race\" will begin at 2:30 p.m. ET on FOX, Fox One, MRN Radio and SiriusXM NASCAR Radio.The drivers will race 200 laps around a 2.5-mile track, all hoping to be the one to hoist the Harley J. Earl Trophy in Victory Lane. The Daytona 500 has opened the NASCAR season every February since 1982.The NASCAR website says it is \"considered the most prestigious and important race in NASCAR.\"William Byron won last year's Daytona 500, marking his second victory in as many years. He is one of two active drivers with multiple victories in the race, alongside Denny Hamlin who has taken three checkered flags in the event. With a win, Byron would become the first driver to ever win the Daytona 500 back-to-back-to-back.Richard Petty is the all-time Daytona 500 win leader with seven and Cale Yarborough has four. Hamlin has a chance to tie for second-best all time and he's high in the conversation for drivers who could take the win. Ryan Blaney, who is after his first Daytona 500 win, and Joey Logano, who hasn't won it since 2015, are also two drivers to watch on Sunday. Last year's champ, Byron, clearly can not be ruled out either.\nSinger Miranda Lambert will perform ahead of the action and actor Kurt Russell will lead the field to the green flag.This year's race marks the 25th anniversary of the death of NASCAR legend Dale Earnhardt Sr., who died in a crash on the last lap in 2001. He has one Daytona 500 win, but he still holds the all-time record for total victories at Daytona International Speedway with 34.Where to watch the Daytona 500Date: Sunday, Feb. 15 | Time: 2:30 p.m. ETLocation: Daytona International Speedway -- Daytona Beach, FloridaTV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free) | Radio: MRN Radio, SiriusXM NASCAR Radio\nDaytona 500 starting lineup1.

Those who are knocked out will bow out empty-handed.Unlike last year's inaugural event, there weren't many upsets in the first round on Wednesday. Seven of the top eight seeds advanced, including all four No. 1 seeds: Kelsey Mitchell, Paige Bueckers, Allisha Gray and Breanna Stewart. The only top-eight seed who lost was Rhyne Howard, who was upset by Vinyl BC teammate Rae Burrell. As a reminder, the 1-on-1 tournament is single-elimination until the finals, which will be a best-of-three series. Games through the semifinals are played to 11 points, by 2s and 3s, or 10 minutes, whichever comes first.

The forward is on a tear -- in her last six Unrivaled games, she's averaging 22.3 points and 10.3 rebounds in 20.1 minutes per game, making her one of the hottest players in the league. She hasn't made a 3-pointer yet this season, but she is capable of hitting them. And last year we learned that bigs are hard to take down in this contest. I have Austin upsetting last year's finalist Aaliyah Edwards in the second round, league co-founder Stewart in the quarters and No. 1 seed Allisha Gray in the semis, before ultimately falling to Bueckers in the championship round.\nOf course, I would not be shocked if every single one of these predictions is incorrect! That is the magic of Unrivaled's 1-on-1 tournament, there is so much talent on the court and all it takes is 30 seconds of hot shooting for an upset to occur. Jack MaloneySecond roundNo. 5 Veronica Burton over No. 1 Kelsey MitchellNo. 2 Kelsey Plum over No. 7 Natisha HiedemanNo. 4 Arike Ogunbowale over No. 1 Paige BueckersNo. 2 Chelsea Gray over No. 3 Jackie YoungNo. 1 Allisha Gray over No. 8 Saniya RiversNo. 7 Rae Burrell over No. 6 Sonia CitronNo. 1 Breanna Stewart over No. 4 Aliyah BostonNo. 2 Aaliyah Edwards over No. 6 Shakira AustinQuarterfinalsVeronica Burton over Kelsey PlumArike Ogunbowale over Chelsea GrayAllisha Gray over Rae BurrellBreanna Stewart over Aaliyah EdwardsSemifinalsVeronica Burton over Arike OgunbowaleBreanna Stewart over Allisha GrayFinalsBreanna Stewart over Veronica BurtonAs we saw in the opening round, when Burton shutout Courtney Williams without even giving up possession, she was way under-seeded. Her size and defensive ability is a real problem in 1-on-1, and she'll have the strength advantage over Mitchell and either Plum or Hiedeman. Ogunbowale is one of the best 1-on-1 players in the world, and is coming off a final four appearance in last year's event. While she will be at a size disadvantage against the other guards in her bracket, her experience and offensive brilliance will be enough to upset Bueckers and get her back to the final four. \nGray received a bye to the second round due to withdrawals, so she has not competed yet, and will have a tricky second-round matchup against defensive ace Rivers. However, Gray has the clear offensive advantage there, and is better on both sides of the ball than Citron and Burrell, who were two of the few players to pull off first-round upsets. Stewart notably got shut out in the first round by Edwards last year, and while she said earlier this week that she only has small goals, she clearly wants to redeem herself. She has a tough road, but her versatility should be enough to get her through to the semis with a rematch victory over Edwards. In the final four, Ogunbowale will finally meet her match in Burton, who has the defensive capability to slow down her offense, and the size and physicality to bully her on the other side of the ball. Stewart, meanwhile will continue her redemptive run by overpowering Gray in the first forward vs. guard showdown. \nBurton's Cinderella run will end in the finals, when Stewart will prove too much. As we saw last year, the forwards have a significant advantage in this format, and Stewart will join her co-founded Napheesa Collier as an Unrivaled 1-on-1 champion. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        While UConn's Sarah Strong has been the top candidate for Player of the Year honors in the 2025-26 women's college basketball season, Vanderbilt sophomore Mikayla Blakes made a loud statement on Thursday night. Blakes scored 34 points in an 86-70 win as the No. 5 Commodores upset No. 4 Texas.\"Prove me wrong that (Mikayla Blakes) is not the SEC Player of the Year and the national Player of the Year,\" Vanderbilt coach Shea Ralph said postgame, while also saying Aubrey Galvan should be Freshman of the Year.\nIt might not be that simple because it will be difficult to take the top spot away from Strong -- the leader of the undefeated No. 1 team in the nation. But Blakes deserves serious consideration.Thursday was her fourth-straight game with at least 30 points, which is impressive in itself but even more so because she is doing it against top competition. She officially joined former UConn star Paige Bueckers as the only two players with three consecutive 30+ points games against AP Top 25 opponents in the last 15 seasons.\nBlakes is averaging 26.2 points per game and recently surpassed Iowa State's Audi Crooks as the Division I leading scorer for this season. One of her biggest strengths is her quick shooting release and high extension. Texas senior Rori Harmon is a solid on-ball defender, but Blakes still figured out how to shoot 9 of 19 from the field and 3 of 6 from beyond the arc on Thursday night. What Blakes did against the Longhorns was historic: her 34 points are the most scored against Texas in the Vic Schaefer era.Blakes is a three-level scorer, but an often overlooked part of her game is her ability to defend. She is averaging around three steals per game, which puts her in the top 25 nationally. Last month, Blakes was named to the Naismith National Defensive Player of the Year Watch List.\nWhile Ralph has no doubt in her mind about the POY award, Blakes is not too concerned about it and is just trying to stay focused on her team's goals.\"Honestly, it's a great award but I think that's not my goal,\" Blakes told SportsCenter after Thursday's game. \"I think my goal is just to do whatever my teammates need me to do. We want to go deep and far into the March Madness tournament and the SEC tournament. So whatever comes with that comes with that. But honestly I'm not really playing just for those awards. I'm playing for my teammates, my coaching staff and for Vanderbilt.\"Last year, Blakes set a new NCAA freshman record by scoring 55 points and helped the Commodores return to the NCAA Tournament for the first time in a decade. This year, Vanderbilt looks strong enough to make it to the Sweet Sixteen for the first time since 2009 and beyond.\nHere are some other takeaways from the week in women's college hoops.Vic Schaefer calls out Texas: 'Softest team I've had in years'Thursday was only Texas' third loss of the season, but coach Vic Schaefer was not pleased with the effort he saw on the court. The Longhorns fell behind to Vanderbilt by 12 at the end of the first quarter, which was Texas' worst point differential in a first quarter in six seasons under Schaefer, per ESPN. Their 26-point deficit in the third quarter was also the first time they have been down by 20+ points this season. During the postgame press conference, Schaefer said his team needed to play with more heart.\"Just quite frankly, we had no heart,\" Schaefer said. \"You want to ask me, what does it take to win at this level? What's it going to take for my team? You gotta have heart. We got no heart... I'm accountable. That's my team. It's so disappointing. It's probably the softest team I've had in years.\"\nOlivia Miles sets career-highOlivia Miles helped No. 17 TCU get a 83-67 road victory at No. 12 Baylor with a 40-point performance, a new career-high. Even more impressively is the fact that she did it by becoming the first Division-I women's basketball player in 25 years to make 10 3s on the road against a ranked opponent.\"This is why we play basketball, for moments like this,\" Miles said during her postgame interview.It was also a big night for Marta Suarez. Her career-high 27 points meant Miles and Suarez combined for the same amount of points as the entire Baylor roster.\nLeBron NXXT Gen by JuJu Even though JuJu Watkins is sidelined this season due to a torn ACL, the USC star is staying busy. She recently became the first athlete to co-create a sneaker within the Nike LeBron NXXT Gen line. The shoe will officially launch on March 12 on the Nike website and at select retailers globally.To celebrate, Watkins held a shoe unveiling event in Watts, the community where she grew up. Meanwhile, LeBron James debuted the shoe during the Lakers' 105-99 win over Golden State last weekend. \"Working with LeBron to co-create a first is wild,\" Watkins said in a statement. \"It's built for my game, my story. Shaping something to share with the next generation of hoopers means everything.\"\nGame to watch this weekendNo. 3 South Carolina at No. 6 LSU -- Saturday (8:30 p.m. ET on ABC/fubo)This will be MiLaysia Fulwiley's first time facing the Gamecocks since transferring to LSU, and that alone should be fun to see. However, this is also one of those games that could have a significant impact in March. Although the LSU fell to Texas on Feb. 5, a win over South Carolina could still help the Tigers' case regarding a potential No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament. The SEC has been extremely competitive this season, and things got even more interesting after Texas lost to Vanderbilt on Thursday night.\n            ",

Utah carried a seven-point lead into the fourth quarter against Orlando, yet fell, 120-117. The Jazz were up three points entering the final quarter against the Heat, but pulled out a 115-111 victory. The Pacers on the other hand were fined $100,000 for violating the Player Participation Policy during a Feb. 3 matchup against the Jazz. An investigation revealed that star forward Pascal Siakam and two other starters who did not play could have participated under the medical standard in the policy. In its press release, the NBA said the Pacers could have held the players out of other games that would have been in compliance with its policy.\"Overt behavior like this that prioritizes draft position over winning undermines the foundation of NBA competition and we will respond accordingly to any further actions that compromise the integrity of our games,\" NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement.  \"Additionally, we are working with our Competition Committee and Board of Governors to implement further measures to root out this type of conduct.\"\nEntering Thursday night, the 18-37 Jazz ranked third-worst in the West, while the 15-40 Pacers ranked second-worst in the East. Both teams are far outside of playoff contention and will be in the NBA Draft lottery, however, each of the three worst teams in the league have a 14% chance to win the top pick and currently the Pacers are fourth-worst and the Jazz are sixth-worst overall.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        This is an article version of the CBS Sports HQ AM Newsletter, the ultimate guide to every day in sports. You can sign up to get it in your inbox every weekday morning here. \nGood morning and happy Friday! It's Carter Bahns at the keyboard today as we enter the first weekend without football since August. I know -- it's hard to move on from one season to the next, but at least we have a plethora of fun events over the next few days to ease the process. The Winter Olympics are in full swing, NBA All-Star Weekend is upon us and the Daytona 500 is here. Sounds like a pretty entertaining weekend to me. Let's dive in.  🇺🇸 Five things to know Friday Team USA crushed Latvia in men's hockey, but the Americans had a tough day on the slopes. The 5-1 win on the ice, fueled by a pair of goals from Brock Nelson, headlined Day 6 at the Winter Olympics for the United States. The men's hockey squad bounced back after having two goals overturned to cruise to victory in its first game of the tournament. Up next is another preliminary round game against Denmark on Saturday. Not everything went Team USA's way in the Milan Cortina Games yesterday, though. Chloe Kim saw her reign over the women's snowboard halfpipe world come to an end with a silver-medal finish, and Breezy Johnson crashed out of the Super-G. But all was not lost for Johnson. She got engaged moments after her run.Trinidad Chambliss received a preliminary injunction against the NCAA. Ole Miss got its quarterback back. A Mississippi judge ruled in Chambliss' favor in one of the highest profile court cases in college football history, paving the way for the breakout star to return to the Rebels for 2026 despite having exhausted his eligibility. The injunction blocks the NCAA from enforcing its eligibility rules against Chambliss until after a later hearing, which may not come until after next season.Jaren Jackson Jr. will undergo knee surgery. Days after they acquired Jackson at the NBA trade deadline, the Utah Jazz are gearing up to be without their two-time All-Star potentially through the end of the season. Jackson is reportedly expected to make a full recovery from the procedure, which will remove a pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) growth from his left knee. The Jazz discovered the disease in a post-trade physical.Caleb Wilson is out indefinitely with a broken hand. The timing of this injury could not be worse for North Carolina, which will be without its best player for the foreseeable future as the NCAA Tournament quickly approaches. While X-rays taken during Tuesday's loss at Miami came back negative, further imaging upon UNC's return to Chapel Hill revealed a fracture in Wilson's left hand. The star freshman who is averaging 19.8 points and 9.4 rebounds per game is a projected top-five NBA Draft pick.The Nick Castellanos era in Philadelphia is over. The Phillies released Castellanos after they failed to find a trade partner for their 33-year-old outfielder. The team will owe Castellanos his $20 million salary for the 2026 season minus the prorated portion of the $780,000 league minimum if and when he signs with another club. Coming off the worst year of his career, the two-time All-Star does not have an obvious landing spot because of his shaky defense but could latch on as a designated hitter or sign with an outfield-needy squad. ⭐ Do not miss this: NBA All-Star Weekend tips off tonight in Los Angeles \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            The NBA finalized on Thursday the rosters for its new All-Star Game format, announcing De'Aaron Fox as a replacement for the injured Giannis Antetokounmpo. Fox became the 28th player selected to the All-Star Game, which features a USA vs. World format and includes three teams (USA Stars, USA Stripes, Team World) competing for cash. Players on the winning team earn $125,000 each while second-place finishers win $50,000 and the third-place squad secures $25,000 apiece. All-Star Weekend opens tonight with the All-Star Celebrity Game (7 p.m.) and Rising Stars (9 p.m.). All-Star Saturday (5 p.m.) features the 3-Point Contest, Shooting Stars and Slam Dunk Contest. And the main event, the All-Star Game, tips off at 5 p.m. on Sunday. \nHere are the betting favorites for each event: NBA Rising Stars: Team Melo (+155)Shooting Stars: Team Knicks (+150)3-Point Contest: Kon Knueppel (+380)Slam Dunk Contest: Carter Bryant (+180)All-Star Game: USA Stripes (+150)All-Star Game MVP: Victor Wembanyama (+450) 🏁 Kyle Busch takes pole position in Daytona 500 \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            The \"Great American Race\" is set for Sunday, and Kyle Busch will open in pole position after he finished first in Daytona 500 qualifying earlier this week. Last year's pole-sitter, Chase Briscoe, stands second in the lineup. The Duels on Thursday determined positions Nos. 3-40 for the famed 500-mile NASCAR Cup Series race. Corey LaJoie, Chandler Smith, BJ McLeod and JJ Yeley failed to qualify. The countdown to the green flag begins at 2:30 p.m. on Sunday. William Byron (starting 39th) has won the last two, and he's attempting to be the first driver to three-peat at the Daytona 500. Here's where to watch. Weather may not cooperate with the NASCAR season-opener, though. Rain showers are in the forecast and could force interruptions, as they did last year when precipitation caused a nearly three-hour delay. \nHere are the first 10 drivers in the Daytona 500 starting lineup: Kyle BuschChase BriscoeJoey LoganoChase ElliottRyan BlaneyCarson HocevarAustin DillonKyle LarsonBrad KeselowskiMichael McDowell 👍👎 The best (and not-so-best) of the rest \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            The NBA issued six-figure fines to the Jazz and Pacers over roster management, alleging overt tanking behavior.Maxx Crosby reportedly feels betrayed by the Raiders' front office, all the way to the top.

He would subsequently make the leap from Double-A to the majors, flourishing after developing one of the best forkballs in the sport's history. \"When he had that great year in 1959 you had to wonder how he did it, but he did, had that great forkball and I don't think he weighed more than 145 pounds,\" a bullpen catcher said of Face.Face then spent 15 of those 16 seasons with the Pirates (he would suit up for the Detroit Tigers and Montreal Expos before retiring after the 1969 season). Overall, he logged a 3.48 ERA (109 ERA+) and a 2.42 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 848 appearances, all the while recording 191 saves (the statistic did not become official until most of the way through his career) and 21.1 Wins Above Replacement. He helped the Pirates win the 1960 World Series, notching three saves in the Fall Classic against the New York Yankees.Face made three All-Star Games while pitching in six total -- Major League Baseball played multiple Midsummer Classics for a time as a means of raising funds for the players' pension funds. Face also received Most Valuable Player Award consideration on three occasions, including after his remarkable 1959 season that saw him post an 18-1 record across 57 relief appearances.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        One of the hottest players in the world over the last two weeks could not be extinguished on Thursday at Pebble Beach Golf Links. Ryo Hisatsune continued to stoke the flame in his opening round of the 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, signing for a bogey-free, 10-under 62 to grab the early lead in the first signature event of the season.Hisatsune's 62 represents his lowest career round on the PGA Tour, and it comes in his tournament debut at Pebble Beach. His previous low of 63 came just last weekend at the WM Phoenix Open, where he finished in a share of 10th place. The young man from Japan rolled in more than 150 feet of putts and even chipped in for birdie on the par-4 16th to start a run of three straight into the clubhouse. His lead going into Friday, where he will play at Spyglass Hill, is just a single stroke over American Sam Burns, who was similarly on fire on the greens en route to his 63. Keegan Bradley came in late at the same number as he missed a chance on his last hole to tie the course record on Spyglass. Burns just barely led the field in strokes gained putting on Thursday, gaining more than five strokes with the wand in hand. Hisatsune cleared more than five strokes on the greens as well.\"Anytime you can go bogey-free, regardless of where you're playing, is always a good thing, and especially to do it around here,\" Burns said. \"It was nice. I made a significant amount of putts and feel like I was hitting it pretty nice. It was a good combination for today. The weather was perfect, so we were just trying to enjoy the day.\"\nPebble Beach played nearly four strokes under par in Round 1, while Spyglass Hill played roughly two strokes more difficult. While conditions were ripe for the taking, world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler struggled yet again in the opening refrain. One week after starting his tournament with a 73, his first over-par round since June 2025, the four-time major champion signed for a 72 to fall 10 strokes off the pace -- the same deficit he faced after 18 holes at the WM Phoenix Open.Over on Spyglass Hill, Bradley was the low man with a stellar 9-under performance. The most recent U.S. Ryder Cup captain appears to have found something, while Jordan Spieth showed signs of life with a bogey-free 66. Meanwhile, last year's champion, Rory McIlroy, ran into some speed bumps on the greens and signed for a 68 to open up his title defense despite a pair of double bogeys.\nLeader1. Ryo Hisatsune (-10): The experience is beginning to stack up for the 23-year-old. Hisatsune was a member of the final group at Torrey Pines on Sunday, where he finished runner-up to Justin Rose, and he was in the final group on Saturday at the WM Phoenix Open alongside his golf hero, Hideki Matsuyama, before ultimately cashing a top 10 finish. Playing with serious confidence, the right-hander wielded the putter effectively in Round 1, cashing putts from 42, 31, 17, 16, 13 and 12 feet.  He noted that he loves putting on these poa annua putting surfaces, but his ball-striking will need to improve over the next 54 holes if he is to turn this momentum into his first victory on the PGA Tour.ContendersT2. Sam Burns, Keegan Bradley (-9)T4. Chris Gotterup, Tony Finau, Patrick Rodgers (-8)T7. Nick Taylor, Akshay Bhatia, Andrew Novak, Tom Hoge (-7)T11. Russell Henley, Jake Knapp, Jordan Spieth, Sepp Straka, Rickie Fowler, Matt Fitzpatrick, Patrick Cantlay, Mackenzie Hughes (-6)Lot of big names on the first and second pages of the leaderboard, including Gotterup, who has already won twice this season, but it is hard not to notice what Spieth accomplished on Spyglass. Not only did he hole out for eagle on the par-4 9th, he also managed his way around the par 72 without dropping a shot, maintaining the momentum he had garnered. The reason? Spieth's putting from close range. Typically good for one miss from near distance, Spieth was solid inside 10 feet and added makes from 14 and 12 feet, the latter coming on the last hole to save par and maintain his bogey-free round.\n\"I thought I was really good on and around the greens,\" Spieth said. \"I actually didn't hit many greens for how kind of well I thought I was swinging the club. I pulled a few kind of the wrong clubs. It's easy to do out here. You can pull a club you think's going to go far enough, and it just doesn't go anywhere here. So I've got to get a little tighter on some of that decision making, but when I got into trouble, I got out of trouble. \"Obviously, holing a wedge shot was probably the highlight of the day. But I just really plotted my way around. When I missed, I missed in the right spot. I'd like to get a little bit tighter as we go around Pebble, but at Spyglass 6 under may be the best I ever shot around here, so, very pleased.\"\nScheffler's strugglesFor the second straight week, Scheffler will attempt to mount a comeback from 10 strokes down across the final 54 holes of a tournament. While at the WM Phoenix Open he was upended by one hour out of an otherwise decent round, Scheffler's first round at Pebble Beach was more of a slow bleed. He missed birdie chances from 8 feet on Nos. 1-2, connected from that distance on No. 4 and then gave it back from 4 feet on No. 5. A birdie flew onto his scorecard on the par-5 6th after nearly finding the surface in two, but that was his last birdie until the last hole of the day.\nIn between them, Scheffler continued to struggle with the putter -- he missed a par putt from just inside 3 feet on No. 12 -- but it was the iron play that was uncharacteristically poor. He lost about 2.50 strokes on approach, ranked 73rd in the 80-man field in that category and failed to give himself looks from hole high consistently -- a rarity in his game.2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am updated odds, picksOdds via DraftKings SportsbookKeegan Bradley: 8-1Chris Gotterup: 19/2Sam Burns: 10-1Ryo Hisatsune: 13-1Matt Fitzpatrick: 17-1Rory McIlroy: 17-1Jake Knapp: 18-1Patrick Rodgers: 18-1For those wondering, Scheffler is listed at 35-1, a far cry from the 3-1 price tag at tournament open. No suggestion either way here, but a 65 seems certain on Friday. McIlroy may ultimately be the guy, though, as he left so many strokes out there on the greens and still managed to beat the scoring average on Spyglass by a couple of strokes. The return to his blades looked like a smart move, at least on Thursday.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        During the week leading up to the Super Bowl, there was some speculation that Derek Carr was looking to make a comeback, and now we know that's definitely the case because he confirmed it on his podcast. That's right, after sitting in retirement for just one season, it appears that Carr is ready to return to the NFL. During the most recent episode of \"Home Grown with David & Derek Carr,\" the Carr brothers talked about multiple topics, including Derek's thoughts on coming out of retirement. Carr announced his retirement back in May and a big reason made the decision to leave the NFL is because he was dealing with a shoulder injury, an injury that seems to be doing much better now. \"Would I do it? Yes,\" Carr said of coming out of retirement. \"Would I do it for anybody? Absolutely not.\"David then chimed in and pointed out that no team should even bother calling Derek unless they're a true playoff contender. \n\"Unless you're trying to make a run at this thing, the confetti falling, the Lombardi in the sky, that's what we're after,\" David said. Derek then added that he only has two qualifiers for a possible return. \"I told you two things: I'd have to be healthy and I'd want a chance to win a Super Bowl,\" Derek said. \"And obviously, that's a tough thing to find. That's hard to do. That's not easy.\"So there you have it. Derek Carr is open to a return, but he'll likely only come out of retirement for a playoff contender. With that in mind, we're going to take a look at some possible landing spots for Carr and we're only going to include teams that will likely contend for a playoff spot, which is why you won't find a team like the Jets on this list. The Jets have a very obvious need a quarterback, but they're 12 players away from being five players away from a Super Bowl contender, so it seems unlikely that Carr would want to go there. \nOne thing to remember with Carr is that the Saints still own his rights, so if he does come out of retirement, New Orleans would have to be willing to trade him away to his new destination. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. VikingsThe Vikings are currently in a nightmare situation at quarterback. They took at gamble at the position in 2024 and hit the jackpot, but then they threw all their money away in 2025. And of course, we're talk about Sam Darnold here. Darnold led Minnesota to a 14-3 record in 2024, but the Vikings got greedy and thought they could do better, so they let him walk in free agency and decided to roll the dice by going all in with J.J. McCarthy. In his first full year as a starter, McCarthy looked much closer to being a bust than someone who can eventually be Minnesota's franchise quarterback. The Vikings have already proved they can win games with the right quarterback and Carr seems like the perfect veteran who could come in and help. The Vikings won nine games in 2025 with McCarthy, Carson Wentz and Max Brosmer all starting at least two games, and Carr seems like a step up from that combo. \n If you give Carr the right weapons, he generally does pretty well, and the Vikings have some receiving weapons in Justin Jefferson, Jordan Addison and T.J. Hockenson. Carr might have to compete with McCarthy for the job, but that's likely a competition where he would be feeling pretty confident. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. SteelersThe Steelers are obviously waiting on Aaron Rodgers, but at 42 years old, there's certainly a chance that Rodgers will decide to retire instead of returning for another season. If that happens, then Pittsburgh will be in quite the quandary at quarterback. The Steelers do have Mason Rudolph and Will Howard, but you have to think Mike McCarthy would me more comfortable with a smart veteran quarterback who could efficiently run his offense and that's where Carr would come in.McCarthy has shown that he can work well with veteran quarterbacks. Aaron Rodgers won two MVPs while playing for McCarthy in Green Bay, and let's not forget about Dak Prescott, who finished second in the MVP race in 2023 while playing for McCarthy in Dallas. Carr isn't quite at that level, but McCarty could likely help him elevate his game. \nIf Carr went to Pittsburgh for one year, he could be a bridge guy in a move that would give the Steelers some time to find their eventual quarterback of the future.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Colts or ChiefsWe're lumping these two teams together for one big reason: They both have a starting quarterback who suffered a serious injury toward the end of the 2025 season. Let's start with the Colts. Daniel Jones had a strong season in his first-year with Indianapolis, but it came to a painful end in December when he tore his Achilles. That's one of the most brutal injuries in sports and there's no guarantee he's going to be ready for Week 1 in 2026. As a matter of fact, if you look at the recovery timeline for quarterbacks, it would be a borderline miracle if Jones were to play in Week 1. Aaron Rodgers and Kirk Cousins both tore their Achilles in 2023 and they ended up playing in Week 1 of the following season, but both of those injuries happened early in the season (Cousins' injury came in Week 8 while Rodgers tore his Achilles in Week 1. Jones suffered his injury in Week 14).\nNot only is Jones' health up in the air, but he's also set to be a free agent, so the Colts have fo figure out what they want to do with him, and that's where Carr comes in. If the Colts decide to re-sign Jones, Carr could sign a one-year deal and be the QB until Jones is ready to play. If Carr has proven one thing in his career, it's that he can be successful when he has some great offensive talent around him and the Colts have that. They have a solid offensive line, they have one of the best running backs in the NFL (Jonathan Taylor), they have a solid receiving group led by Michael Pittman and they have a solid young tight end in Tyler Warren. This is the kind of team that Carr could thrive on. As for the Chiefs, Patrick Mahomes is also coming back from a major injury. The two-time MVP tore his ACL in mid-December, and right now, it's not clear if he'll be able to play in Week 1. Mahomes definitely seems to be in a rush to get back, but if the Chiefs added Carr, then the Mahomes could take his time in rehab. In this case, Mahomes could circle Week 3 or Week 4 on the schedule and plan to come back then. Carr would obviously take the job knowing that he would only be the starter for the first few weeks of the season, but he would also take it knowing that he's playing for a Super Bowl contender, which is what he wants to be doing at this point in his career. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. FalconsThe Falcons feel like a wild card here. For one, it's highly unlikely that the Saints would want to do anything to help their hated rival and a trade with New Orleans is the only way Atlanta would be able to acquire Carr. \nIf the Falcons could get over that hump, adding Carr would certainly be an interesting option. The Falcons obviously have Michael Penix Jr., but new team president Matt Ryan was noncommittal when asked if Penix would be the starting QB in 2026. Ryan told CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones that Penix's role will be decided by new head coach Kevin Stefanski. \"Kevin's responsibility is to be the head coach of the football team and he's going to let you know who our starters are and who our starters are not. It's not my place to go in there,\" Ryan said during Super Bowl week. \nWith the Falcons expected to release Cousins and with them being noncommittal with Penix, that certainly leaves the door open for them to bring in a new quarterback. They could look to sign someone like Joe Flacco, but if they can get Carr for cheap from New Orleans, then the four-time Pro Bowler would definitely make some sense. \n            ",

    "body": "\nThirty-two teams resume play in the FA Cup this weekend as fourth round action gets underway, the pack of clubs left standing led by some of the Premier League's finest as the competition to lift England's most historic trophy continues.Premier League giants Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City will take on lower division sides as they target a spot in the quarterfinals, while a handful of competitive matches also await. Two all-Premier League matchups make up the 16 games on the slate, with Liverpool set to take on Brighton and Hove Albion and Aston Villa to square off against Newcastle United. A handful of Championship teams will also face off against one another, including Wrexham's match against Ipswich Town in a battle between two teams chasing promotion to the top flight and a fixture between Norwich City and West Bromwich Albion.The list of contenders for the trophy is led by 14 Premier League clubs, most of the top flight's 20 teams making it through the third round unscathed. One notable exception are reigning champions Crystal Palace, who were ousted in a historic upset by a non-league side last month.Here's what you need to know about the next round of action before tuning in.FA Cup fourth round TV scheduleAll times U.S./EasternFriday, Feb. 13Hull City vs. Chelsea, 2:45 p.m. (ESPN2)Wrexham vs. Ipswich Town, 2:45 p.m. (ESPN Select)Saturday, Feb. 14Burton Albion vs. West Ham United, 7:15 a.m. (ESPN Select)Southampton vs. Leicester City, 10 a.m. (ESPN Select)Burnley vs. Mansfield Town, 10 a.m. (ESPN Select)Norwich City vs. West Bromwich Albion, 10 a.m. (ESPN Select)Port Vale vs. Bristol City, 10 a.m. (ESPN Select)Manchester City vs. Salford City, 10 a.m. (ESPN Select)Aston Villa vs. Newcastle United, 12:45 p.m. (ESPN Select)Liverpool vs. Brighton and Hove Albion, 3 p.m. (ESPN Select)Sunday, Feb. 15Birmingham City vs. Leeds United, 7 a.m. (ESPN)Grimsby Town vs. Wolverhampton Wanderers, 8:30 a.m. (ESPN Select)Oxford United vs. Sunderland, 9 a.m. (ESPN Select)Stoke City vs. Fulham, 9 a.m. (ESPN Select)Arsenal vs. Wigan Athletic, 11:30 a.m. (ESPN Select)Monday, Feb. 16Macclesfield Town vs. Brentford, 2:45 p.m. (ESPN Select)Macclesfield Town, the last non-league team standingThere will be one clear underdog heading into the fourth round -- Macclesfield Town, the only non-league team remaining in the competition. They have already made history by beating Crystal Palace 2-0 in the third round, becoming the first non-league side to knock out the reigning champions since Palace themselves did it in the 1908-09 season. The challenge of advancing in the FA Cup does not get any easier from here, though. They next face Premier League side Brentford, who are in the midst of an impressive first season under coach Keith Andrews. The Bees are in the hunt to qualify for European competition for the first time in their history and are not all that far off from the UEFA Champions League berths, arguably making them one of the most formidable challengers for the FA Cup left.A different type of Manchester derbyManchester City, meanwhile, return to play in the FA Cup with a favorable matchup against League Two side Salford City in a local tie against a team from the Greater Manchester area -- and one owned by a batch of ex-Manchester United players. City will naturally go into this match as the heavy favorites, their might on display when they beat Salford 8-0 in FA Cup third round action last year. Pep Guardiola's side, though, also seem to have a new lease on life after a come-from-behind win against Liverpool last weekend, perhaps providing them additional incentive to come out with a win as they look to win their first trophy in two seasons. Considering the favorable circumstances, expect Guardiola to rotate through his options but considering City have several quality attackers at their disposal, the team selection may offer little reprieve for Salford.Liam Rosenior's Hull City returnChelsea have a chance to bounce back from a midweek draw against Leeds United when they return to FA Cup action on Friday, opening up the fourth round slate with a trip to Hull City. It marks a homecoming of sorts for new Blues coach Liam Rosenior, who cut his managerial teeth during a two year stint with Hull -- and offers a chance for him to prove his worth in the early weeks of his tenure at Chelsea. Rosenior inherited a team that won two trophies last season under his predecessor Enzo Maresca, the UEFA Conference League title in which a young team announced themselves and the FIFA Club World Cup title in which they proved they could contend with some of Europe's best on any given day. Rosenior, though, has also joined a team with a sputtering attack, epitomized by Cole Palmer's big miss against Leeds as a dry spell in front of goal continues. Friday's game at Hull may not offer any revealing answers on that front, but Rosenior's big task is still getting the best out of Palmer, and perhaps picking up silverware along the way in the short-term.\n            ",

The Croatian manager and former national team defender has previously managed Galatasaray, Hellas Verona, Olympique Marseille, Lazio and lastly Juventus as he replaced Thiago Motta on March 2025 before being sacked earlier this season from the Bianconeri. Tottenham have decided to hire Tudor only a few days after parting ways with Thomas Frank, who was sacked after a disappointing start of the 2025-26 season, with only two wins in the last 17 Premier League games, and will appoint Tudor as caretaker manager until June 2026 before looking for a permanent coach in the summer. \nAfter Spurs decided to sack their former manager Thomas Frank, they needed to decide between a caretaker manager or a permanent one, but then ended up hiring a short term coach. The English team is currently sitting in 14th place in the Premier League standings, only five points above the relegation zone and with only two wins in their last 17 games played in the domestic league. Despite a positive Champions League spell, where Spurs ended up in the top eight and advanced to the Round of 16 of the tournament, the club decided to sack the manager who was appointed in the summer 2025 to replace Ange Postecoglou.It makes sense to hire a caretaker coach right now as more options will be available in the summer 2026, when multiple managers are expected to leave their jobs, or even after the 2026 World Cup. On that matter, there have been rumors of a possible comeback of current USMNT manager Mauricio Pochettino in London, where he was the coach from 2014 to 2019, leading the club to a Champions League final they lost to Liverpool. \nTudor, on the other hand, could immediately instill a sense of unity and purpose, helping the team meet its short-term objectives while positioning himself for a longer deal in the summer, much like he recently attempted to do at Juventus. Appointed in March 2025 by the Italian giants to replace Thiago Motta, Tudor guided the side through the final stint of the campaign and secured Champions League qualification. However, when the Bianconeri failed to reach an agreement with either Antonio Conte or Gian Piero Gasperini, they opted to continue with Tudor. The decision ultimately proved unsuccessful: he was dismissed in October and replaced by current Juventus head coach Luciano Spalletti.\n            \n    ",

It's a Big Ten showdown between the schools currently tied for third (Michigan State) and tied for sixth (Wisconsin) in a conference projected to get 10 teams into the 2026 NCAA Tournament. Oddly, both are coming off of victories over Illinois. Michigan State's was Saturday, 85-82, in overtime. Wisconsin's was Tuesday, 92-90, also in overtime.Now back to Fears.I think I speak for everybody when I say I hope the goofy things the All-American candidate has done in recent weeks to damage his reputation are fully behind him (just like I hope Darryn Peterson's cramping-issues and hamstring-issues and ankle-issues and flu-like symptoms are fully behind him). If I have to spend a minute on Sunday's episode of the Eye On College Basketball Podcast talking about Fears for reasons other than points, assists or rebounds, it'll be disappointing.Either way, can't wait to watch!Michigan State, which is No. 12 in Friday morning's updated CBS Sports Top 25 And 1 daily college basketball rankings, is listed as a 1.5-point favorite on the road. If the Spartans win, they'll improve to 21-4 overall and 11-3 in league games. That would push them into a tie for second with Illinois in the Big Ten. Both the Spartans and the Illini would then wake up Saturday two games back of Michigan in the conference standings.\nMichigan, of course, is No. 1 in the Top 25 And 1.

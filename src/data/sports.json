He has been labeled as questionable to return. At halftime, Steelers coach Mike Tomlin told CBS Sports Melanie Collins that Rodgers was being evaluated and that they were hoping that he would return at some point. Rodgers was seen holding his wrist after being hit by multiple Bengals defenders during the Steelers' final offensive play of the first half. Rodgers was replaced by Mason Rudolph, Pittsburgh's longtime backup who has a 9-8-1 record as an NFL starting quarterback. Rudolph is 8-4-1 as the Steelers' starting quarterback that includes a 2-0 record against the Bengals. Rudolph's most memorable game against Cincinnati took place in Week 16 of the 2023 season. With the Steelers reeling (they had lost their last three games to fall to 7-7), Rudolph threw for 290 yards and two touchdowns while leading Pittsburgh to a 34-11 win over the Bengals. Rudolph then led Pittsburgh to two more wins to close out the regular season while clinching the AFC's final playoff spot. \nRodgers, 41, helped lead Pittsburgh to a 10-6 halftime lead over a Cincinnati team that defeated the Steelers back in Week 7. Rodgers gave the Steelers an early lead by throwing an 11-yard touchdown pass to running back Kenneth Gainwell on the game's opening drive. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        With the latest DraftKings promo code, new users can take advantage of $300 in bonus bets and three free months of NBA League Pass. The Denver Broncos have won seven straight games despite having a below-average offense, scoring 23.5 points per game this season. The Broncos are third in scoring defense, allowing just 17.3 points per game, a key reason why they are tied for the best record in the AFC at 8-2. They'll have one of their toughest tests of the season on Sunday, playing the Kansas City Chiefs in a 4:25 p.m. ET start that should be one of the top games of the Week 11 NFL schedule. The SportsLine model is backing the Broncos to cover as four-point underdogs as one of its Sunday best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook.The model also sees value in playing Under 48.5 points in Seahawks vs. Rams for Sunday best bets at DraftKings, despite both teams coming off high-scoring performances last week. Also, one of SportsLine's top experts has a best bet on an elite Sunday Night Football matchup of Lions vs. Eagles (-2.5, 46.5). Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins, plus 3 months of NBA League Pass free: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times. Since its inception, it has generated a betting profit of over $2,000 for $100 players on its top-rated college spread football picks. Anybody following its college football betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Sunday best bets at DraftKings SportsbookSeahawks vs. Rams: Under 48.5 total pointsBroncos (+4.5) vs. ChiefsLions (+2.5) vs. EaglesCombining the model's three picks into a Sunday parlay at DraftKings would result in a payout of +596 (risk $100 to win $596). Bet it at DraftKings here:\nSeahawks vs. Rams: Under 48.5 total pointsPlaying an Under on two teams that combined to score 86 points, with each team scoring more than 40 points last week, may seem like an odd play, but the fact that those performances have raised this over/under to nearly 50 points has the model feeling like it's an overreaction. The Rams and Seahawks both have top-five scoring offenses, with Seattle ranking third and Los Angeles fifth, but they also each have top-five scoring defenses, including the Rams ranking second at 17 ppg allowed. Both teams have the personnel to slow down the other team and put pressure on pocket passers such as Matthew Stafford and Sam Darnold, which could lead to a lower point total than the sportsbooks are forecasting. The model projects the Under to hit in 61% of simulations. Back the Under at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Broncos (+4.5) vs. ChiefsYes, the Chiefs nearly always winning off a bye with Andy Reid as the head coach has a popular narrative this week. And although that is true (Kansas City is 9-3 in the regular season after a bye under Reid), this isn't the same Kansas City team as in recent seasons. The Chiefs are 5-4 this year, and they haven't lost more than four games over an entire season in five of their last seven seasons. The Bills defeated the Chiefs, 28-21, in Week 9 before Kansas City's bye week by putting pressure on Patrick Mahomes. The Broncos have arguably the best defensive line in the NFL, and they are capable of replicating Buffalo's success, which had Patrick Mahomes finishing with a completion percentage below 50% for the first time in his career. Projecting a strong defensive performance and the offense making enough plays, the model has the Broncos covering the spread in 51% of simulations. Back the Broncos at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Lions (+2.5) vs. Eagles\"The Eagles gutted out a tough win in Green Bay on Monday, but it was not an impressive showing by their offense, which managed eight or fewer yards in six of 10 offensive series,\" SportsLine NFL expert R.J. White said. \"The defense was very much bend-but-don't-break, with the Packers scoring once on six drives into Philly territory. This is a much tougher opponent, especially with Dan Campbell taking over playcalling duties on offense. The Lions also have a D-line capable of neutralizing Philly's strength up front and limiting scoring once again.\" The last two Lions games have gone over. Back the Lions at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:\nWant more Sunday NFL picks?You've seen some of the model's Sunday NFL best bets.

    "body": "\nIt was widely expected the Philadelphia Eagles and Detroit Lions would meet in the NFC Championship Game last year, but the matchup did not come to fruition as Detroit shockingly was ousted by the Washington Commanders in the Divisional Round of the playoffs. That showdown could happen this postseason, but the clubs first will meet in Week 11 of the 2025 NFL season as the Eagles host the Lions at Lincoln Financial Field at 8:20 p.m. ET on Sunday Night Football.Philadelphia (7-2), which has a comfortable lead in the NFC East, is coming off its third consecutive victory - a 10-7 triumph over the Green Bay Packers last Monday. Detroit (6-3) rolled past Washington 44-22 last week and is tied with the Chicago Bears atop the NFC North.Eight games are on Sunday's NBA schedule, including a showdown between the Chicago Bulls (6-5) and Utah Jazz (4-8) at 8 p.m. ET at the Delta Center in Salt Lake City. The Bulls are looking to snap a four-game losing streak, while the Jazz seek just their second win in six contests.Meanwhile, the NHL has four games on its slate following a morning matchup between the Nashville Predators and Pittsburgh Penguins in the 2025 NHL Global Series in Sweden. One of the contests has the New York Rangers (10-7-2) hosting the Detroit Red Wings (10-7-1) at Madison Square Garden at 7 p.m. ET. The Rangers are riding a three-game winning streak but are just 1-6-1 at home this season.There also are more than 30 college basketball games on Sunday, with the action concluding when Miami (3-0) takes on No. 10 Florida (2-1) in the Jacksonville Hoops Showdown at 8:30 p.m. ET at the VyStar Veterans Memorial Arena in Jacksonville. Miami trounced Stetson 102-61 in its last outing, while Florida edged Florida State 78-76 last Tuesday.The Eagles are 2.5-point favorites against the Lions in the latest consensus NFL odds. The Bulls are 4.5-point favorites against the Jazz, the Rangers are -141 favorites on the money line against the Red Wings and Miami is a 10.5-point favorite against Florida.Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Sunday, Nov. 16. All times EasternNFL best bets, where to watchLions at EaglesTime: 8:20 p.m. | Location: Philadelphia | TV: NBC | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Over 46.5 (-116) | Expert: Eagles -2.5 (-121)This matchup is unlikely to be as low-scoring as Philadelphia's last game was. Each of the Eagles' previous three contests saw 50 or more combined points scored, while the Lions are second in the NFL with an average of 31.4 points per game. These clubs put up a total of 73 points in their most recent meeting in 2022 and combined for 50 in their showdown a year earlier. Factoring in all of that, the SportsLine Projection Model sees a shootout on Sunday Night Football, as the Over hits in 52% of its simulations. SportsLine expert Emory Hunt believes that even though Detroit's offense is clicking, Philadelphia will cover the spread as he feels the Eagles are a good team on both sides of the ball and play their best when things look bleak.More NFL best betsSeahawks-Rams Under 48.5 (-109, SportsLine model B-rated play)Jacoby Brissett Over 225.5 passing yards -114 (R.J.

Both of Utah's last two contests have gone Over the projected total for this matchup, but only one of Chicago's past five has done so. Keeping that in mind, the SportsLine Projection Model's simulations say the Under for Sunday's clash hits more than 56% of the time. SportsLine NBA expert Mike Barner thinks Utah's Lauri Markkanen, who is sixth in the league in scoring with an average of 29.3 points, will be productive against his former team as he is coming off a 40-point performance versus Atlanta and is averaging 33.2 per game at home this season.NHL best bets, where to watchRed Wings at RangersTime: 7 p.m. | Location: New York | TV: NHL Network | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine pick -- Model: Under 6The Rangers had a brief offensive surge, scoring a total of 13 goals in victories against the Predators and Tampa Bay Lightning, before tallying just once in a 2-1 shootout triumph over the Columbus Blue Jackets on Saturday. Detroit totaled 10 goals over its last two games after scoring a combined two times in its previous three outings. New York erupted for six tallies in its last home contest after netting only seven over its first seven games at Madison Square Garden this season, and the SportsLine Projection Model doesn't see a high-scoring affair taking place Sunday as the Under hits in almost 61% of its simulations.CBB best bets, where to watchMiami vs. FloridaTime: 8:30 p.m. | Location: Jacksonville, Fla. | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine pick -- Model: Under 171.5 (-109)Both teams have played three games thus far this season, and the total was Over the projected number for this matchup in just one of them, as Florida was defeated 93-87 by Arizona in its opener.

The Seminoles have seen extremely high highs and tremendously low lows since he took over in 2020. The high point was the 2024 season when they went undefeated in the regular season and won the ACC championship, only to controversially get left out of the College Football Playoff at 13-0. After that season, his second straight season with double-digit wins, Norvell was awarded a massive new contract extension that takes him through 2031. \n        \n            \n                Meet the candidates -- 88 of them: The only list you need for college football's wildest coaching carousel\n                \n                    Chris Hummer                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhat is Mike Norvell's contract buyout at Florida State?Norvell's extension tacked six more years on to his original contract and bumped his annual salary up north of $10 million per year, putting him in line with the elite coaches in college football. Norvell's buyout is 85% of his remaining contract, and from 2025 to 2031, Norvell is scheduled to make $72.7 million. That means his buyout before this season was $61.8 million and his buyout after this season would still be $53.3 million. The buyout can be paid in full or in monthly installments through the 2031 season. Norvell did agree to restructure his deal after last year's 2-10 debacle, taking a one-year pay cut of $4.5 million for the 2025 season to help with potential revenue sharing. However, he has the opportunity to make that money back in bonuses through the remainder of his contract -- and would get the full amount back in his buyout if fired after this season -- and then a pro rated amount of that $4.5 million, decreasing by $750,000 each year until his contract runs up in 2031.\nNorvell's buyout being north of $50 million makes him one of the ten most expensive coaches in the country to fire. That means things would have to go from bad to worse for Florida State to consider firing him. But after a 3-0 start pushed the Seminoles up into the top 10 in the rankings, things have gone south quickly for Norvell and he will need to steady the ship to avoid his seat getting even hotter. \n            \n    ",

However, a divisional round exit for Detroit paved the way for Philadelphia to enjoy home-field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs, and they parlayed that into the franchise's second Super Bowl title. Now both teams are in contention for home-field advantage again as division leaders through 10 weeks and both teams are 6-3 against the spread on the season. However, Philadelphia is only 2-2 against the number at home while Detroit is 3-2 against the spread on the road. The Lions get the slight nod to cover in 51% of simulations.Over 46.5 pointsThese two teams last met in 2022 for a 38-35 shootout in Detroit. The rosters have turned over a bit since then, but the cores for both teams remain the same with Dan Campbell and Nick Sirianni both coaching by that point and Jared Goff and Jalen Hurts installed as the starting quarterbacks. Both of these defenses are good and not great, and the model is expecting playmakers like Amon-Ra St. Brown, Saquon Barkley, Jahmyr Gibbs and DeVonta Smith to win the day. It predicts that the Over hits in 58% of simulations.Responsible gamingResponsible gaming is a serious topic, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users play responsibly.

    "body": "\n        Familiar matchups may incentivize Week 11 NFL bets, and there's no shortage of those on the NFL schedule. There are nine divisional contests you could make Week 11 NFL picks on, the most of any week thus far. The entire AFC North and NFC West will do battle with Steelers vs. Bengals (+5.5), Ravens vs. Browns (+7.5), Rams vs. Seahawks (+3) and 49ers vs. Cardinals (+3.5), as Brock Purdy will return for San Fran. In terms of non-divisional games, there's a potential Super Bowl preview at 1 p.m. ET on Sunday as Buffalo is a 5.5-point home favorite over Tampa, per the latest Week 11 NFL odds, in a matchup of 6-3 teams coming off defeats. The NFC East is featured in the Week 11 NFL schedule with its teams taking part in three standalone games. Washington is taking on Miami in the first NFL game in Madrid, while Eagles vs. Lions (+2.5) takes place on SNF in what's a potential NFC Title Game preview. Finally on Monday, the Cowboys visit Las Vegas for the first time in the regular season, which has Dak Prescott and Dallas as 3.5-point road favorites over the Raiders, according to the latest Week 11 NFL spreads. All of the updated Week 11 NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Week 11 NFL picks now. LIMITED TIME: Use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1 JOIN NOW. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your initial $5 bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

Being at home doesn't appear to be much of an advantage for the Vikings, who committed eight false starts during a Sunday home loss to Baltimore. That's the second-most false starts by a home team in a game since 2000, as J.J. McCarthy has struggled in his debut season. He has six interceptions and four fumbles (one lost) across his four starts while being sacked 15 times. Meanwhile, Chicago has won six of its last seven games, going 5-2 ATS over that stretch. The model has Chicago prevailing versus the spread over 50% of the time. See which other teams to pick here.\nAnother one of its Week 11 NFL predictions: the Steelers (-5.5, 48.5) cover at home versus the Bengals in well over 50% of simulations. Cincy owns the worst defense, by far, in the NFL, ranking dead last in points allowed and yards allowed, with bottom-three rankings in pass defense, takeaways and redzone defense. Additionally, its three spread victories this year are tied for the fewest in the league, and coming off a bye won't give the Bengals much of an edge as the team is 1-5 ATS over its last six games with a rest advantage. On the other hand, Pittsburgh is 8-4 ATS at home since the start of last year, and its No. 16 offense could look like a top-five unit versus Cincy. The model projects Pittsburgh to score a touchdown more than its season average as the Steelers cover. SportsLine's advanced model also says the Over hits in well over 50% of simulations. See which other teams to pick here.\nHow to make Week 11 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 11 NFL schedule and just revealed two underdogs that outright win, potentially giving you a huge payday. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine.So what Week 11 NFL picks can you make with confidence, and which two teams should you lock in now?

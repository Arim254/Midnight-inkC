Utah carried a seven-point lead into the fourth quarter against Orlando, yet fell, 120-117. The Jazz were up three points entering the final quarter against the Heat, but pulled out a 115-111 victory. The Pacers on the other hand were fined $100,000 for violating the Player Participation Policy during a Feb. 3 matchup against the Jazz. An investigation revealed that star forward Pascal Siakam and two other starters who did not play could have participated under the medical standard in the policy. In its press release, the NBA said the Pacers could have held the players out of other games that would have been in compliance with its policy.\"Overt behavior like this that prioritizes draft position over winning undermines the foundation of NBA competition and we will respond accordingly to any further actions that compromise the integrity of our games,\" NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement.  \"Additionally, we are working with our Competition Committee and Board of Governors to implement further measures to root out this type of conduct.\"\nEntering Thursday night, the 18-37 Jazz ranked third-worst in the West, while the 15-40 Pacers ranked second-worst in the East. Both teams are far outside of playoff contention and will be in the NBA Draft lottery, however, each of the three worst teams in the league have a 14% chance to win the top pick and currently the Pacers are fourth-worst and the Jazz are sixth-worst overall.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The current DraftKings promo code gives new users $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins. Thursday features a three-game NBA slate that features LeBron James in action as the Los Angeles Lakers host the Dallas Mavericks at 10 p.m. ET. Although James will play in the NBA All-Star Game, he'll have time to rest after Thursday, which could lead to more minutes and larger usage. With James active and the Mavericks without multiple players, including Cooper Flagg (foot), the SportsLine Projection Model backs the Lakers to cover as 7.5-point favorites as one of its Thursday NBA best bets at DraftKings. The over/under for Lakers vs. Mavericks is 235.5, the highest total on Thursday's NBA odds board. The model is also backing the Oklahoma City Thunder to cover as 13.5-point favorites against the Milwaukee Bucks in a 7:30 p.m. ET matchup that will not feature Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (abdominal) or Giannis Antetokounmpo (calf). One of SportsLine's top experts has also locked in a college basketball bet for Northern Iowa vs. Belmont at 9 p.m. ET. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every NBA game 10,000 times and has returned well over $10,000 in betting profit for $100 players on its top-rated NBA picks over the past eight-plus seasons.

Anyone following its NBA betting advice at sportsbooks and on betting apps could have seen huge returns.Thursday best bets at DraftKings SportsbookThunder (-13.5) vs. Bucks (-112)Northern Iowa (+5.5) vs. Belmont (-118)Lakers (-7.5) vs. Mavericks (-112)Combining the three picks into a Thursday parlay at DraftKings would result in a payout of +541 (risk $100 to win $541). Bet it at DraftKings here: (Odds subject to change):\nThunder (-13.5) vs. Bucks (-112)The Thunder certainly aren't the same team without Shai Gilgeous-Alexander in the lineup, but they are still 3-2 over their five games with the reigning NBA MVP out with an abdominal injury. They've won two of those three games by at least 27 points, with an average margin of victory of 24 points in the three wins. Oklahoma City is coming off a 136-109 win over the Suns on Wednesday to improve to 42-13 this season. Meanwhile, the Bucks are 4-4 in their eight games with Giannis Antetokounmpo out, but 1-3 against teams with a winning record. The model projects the Thunder to cover in 64% of simulations. Back the Thunder to cover at DraftKings here:Northern Iowa (+5.5) vs. Belmont (-118)\"Belmont saw its nine-game win streak snapped in an OT loss at Bradley, and now the Bruins return home to face a Northern Iowa team they dismantled by 13 in Cedar Falls,\" SportsLine expert Larry Hartstein said. \"But Northern Iowa is playing much better now. The Panthers just destroyed Murray State, the MVC's second-place team, 89-60 on the road, for their third straight win. None of Northern Iowa's last four opponents has scored more than 60 points. While the Bruins are highly efficient offensively, the Panthers hold opponents to 26.5 percent from deep. Northern Iowa has been an underdog six times this season. The Panthers have covered five of those -- the miss coming by 1.5 points at Bradley -- and beaten market expectations by an average of 8.2 points.\" Back Northern Iowa to cover at DraftKings here:Lakers (-7.5) vs. Mavericks (-112)This Dallas Mavericks lineup is certainly not what NBA fans expected to see on display at the start of the season. The Mavericks still haven't seen Kyrie Irving this season, who remains out with a knee injury. They traded away Anthony Davis. And now, No. 1 pick Cooper Flagg, who has dominated lately, is out with a foot injury. The Lakers aren't at full strength either, with Luka Doncic (hamstring) out, but only Doncic and Deandre Ayton (knee, questionable) are on the LA injury report. Meanwhile, Dallas has eight players on its injury report as either questionable, doubtful or out. LeBron James should be additionally rested, as he hasn't played since Monday, and could take on a larger role with the upcoming break. The Lakers are 32-21 compared to the Mavericks at 19-34 this season, and the model projects the Lakers to cover in 67% of simulations.\" Back the Lakers to cover at DraftKings here:\nWant more NBA, college basketball picks on Thursday?You've seen some of the model's Thursday best bets.

Both the men's and women's hockey team should be in the running for a gold medal, Jordan Stolz is a favorite in speed skating, Chloe Kim is hitting the halfpipe in snowboarding and Mikaela Shiffrin will once again be on the ski slopes. And figure skaters Alysa Liu and Ilia Malinin have high potential to reach the podium.\nNorway will attempt to defend its title as the most awarded country in the Winter Olympics, both from 2022 and all-time. The Norwegians won 16 gold medals and 37 total medals at the Beijing Games four years ago, and they possess a large edge in the all-time medal count. Norway has won 148 gold medals and 406 total medals in its 24 appearances at the Winter Olympics. The Americans are a distant second with 330 total medals.Russian and Belarusian athletes are permitted to compete, but only as individuals under a neutral flag. They'll be classified as \"Individual Neutral Athletes,\" and their medals won't factor into the overall count. Russian and Belarusian teams are still banned from competing the Olympics.\nKeep track of the live medal count over the next couple weeks as the United States looks to fill up its trophy case while competing across Northern Italy.

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        First and third base coaches will have to remain in the coach's box until the pitch is thrown after MLB's owners voted to enforce the rule at their quarterly meetings Thursday, reports ESPN. The goal is to cut down on pitch-tipping, specifically the base coaches positioning themselves in a way to pick up a \"tell\" on the pitcher.The Blue Jays and Dodgers were both asked to keep their base coaches inside the coach's box prior to Game 7 of the World Series last year, according to ESPN,. Two years ago, the Blue Jays and Yankees traded barbs after Toronto took exception to Yankees' third-base coach Luis Rojas wandering outside his box. This has become a greater and more widespread issue within the last year or so as teams look to pick up on the pitcher's pitches, sometimes with a base coach looking directly into the pitcher's glove to see his grip.\nSimilar to the foreign substance ban a few years ago, this is not a new rule. MLB will merely ramp up enforcement of an existing rule that has often been ignored over the years. Rule 5.03(c) covers the positioning of first and third base coaches:Base coaches must remain within the coach's box consistent with this Rule, except that a coach who has a play at his base may leave the coach's box to signal the player to slide, advance or return to a base if the coach does not interfere with the play in any manner. Other than exchanging equipment, all base coaches shall refrain from physically touching base runners, especially when signs are being given.Base coaches who violate Rule 5.03 are given a warning for the first offense and are ejected for the second offense, and are subject to further discipline from the commissioner. The base coaches are allowed to move once the pitch is delivered. This most commonly comes into play when the third base coach comes down the line to throw up the stop sign or wave a runner home.\nPicking up on a pitcher tipping his pitches, even by looking into his glove to see his grip, is not against the rules. That falls under on-field gamesmanship. Don't like it? Hide your grip better. Sign-stealing via electronic equipment has largely been eliminated thanks to the PitchCom system, so teams are looking for other ways to gain an advantage.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        One of the hottest players in the world over the last two weeks could not be extinguished on Thursday at Pebble Beach Golf Links. Ryo Hisatsune continued to stoke the flame in his opening round of the 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, signing for a bogey-free, 10-under 62 to grab the early lead in the first signature event of the season.Hisatsune's 62 represents his lowest career round on the PGA Tour, and it comes in his tournament debut at Pebble Beach. His previous low of 63 came just last weekend at the WM Phoenix Open, where he finished in a share of 10th place. The young man from Japan rolled in more than 150 feet of putts and even chipped in for birdie on the par-4 16th to start a run of three straight into the clubhouse. His lead going into Friday, where he will play at Spyglass Hill, is just a single stroke over American Sam Burns, who was similarly on fire on the greens en route to his 63. Keegan Bradley came in late at the same number as he missed a chance on his last hole to tie the course record on Spyglass. Burns just barely led the field in strokes gained putting on Thursday, gaining more than five strokes with the wand in hand. Hisatsune cleared more than five strokes on the greens as well.\"Anytime you can go bogey-free, regardless of where you're playing, is always a good thing, and especially to do it around here,\" Burns said. \"It was nice. I made a significant amount of putts and feel like I was hitting it pretty nice. It was a good combination for today. The weather was perfect, so we were just trying to enjoy the day.\"\nPebble Beach played nearly four strokes under par in Round 1, while Spyglass Hill played roughly two strokes more difficult. While conditions were ripe for the taking, world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler struggled yet again in the opening refrain. One week after starting his tournament with a 73, his first over-par round since June 2025, the four-time major champion signed for a 72 to fall 10 strokes off the pace -- the same deficit he faced after 18 holes at the WM Phoenix Open.Over on Spyglass Hill, Bradley was the low man with a stellar 9-under performance. The most recent U.S. Ryder Cup captain appears to have found something, while Jordan Spieth showed signs of life with a bogey-free 66. Meanwhile, last year's champion, Rory McIlroy, ran into some speed bumps on the greens and signed for a 68 to open up his title defense despite a pair of double bogeys.\nLeader1. Ryo Hisatsune (-10): The experience is beginning to stack up for the 23-year-old. Hisatsune was a member of the final group at Torrey Pines on Sunday, where he finished runner-up to Justin Rose, and he was in the final group on Saturday at the WM Phoenix Open alongside his golf hero, Hideki Matsuyama, before ultimately cashing a top 10 finish. Playing with serious confidence, the right-hander wielded the putter effectively in Round 1, cashing putts from 42, 31, 17, 16, 13 and 12 feet.  He noted that he loves putting on these poa annua putting surfaces, but his ball-striking will need to improve over the next 54 holes if he is to turn this momentum into his first victory on the PGA Tour.ContendersT2. Sam Burns, Keegan Bradley (-9)T4. Chris Gotterup, Tony Finau, Patrick Rodgers (-8)T7. Nick Taylor, Akshay Bhatia, Andrew Novak, Tom Hoge (-7)T11. Russell Henley, Jake Knapp, Jordan Spieth, Sepp Straka, Rickie Fowler, Matt Fitzpatrick, Patrick Cantlay, Mackenzie Hughes (-6)Lot of big names on the first and second pages of the leaderboard, including Gotterup, who has already won twice this season, but it is hard not to notice what Spieth accomplished on Spyglass. Not only did he hole out for eagle on the par-4 9th, he also managed his way around the par 72 without dropping a shot, maintaining the momentum he had garnered. The reason? Spieth's putting from close range. Typically good for one miss from near distance, Spieth was solid inside 10 feet and added makes from 14 and 12 feet, the latter coming on the last hole to save par and maintain his bogey-free round.\n\"I thought I was really good on and around the greens,\" Spieth said. \"I actually didn't hit many greens for how kind of well I thought I was swinging the club. I pulled a few kind of the wrong clubs. It's easy to do out here. You can pull a club you think's going to go far enough, and it just doesn't go anywhere here. So I've got to get a little tighter on some of that decision making, but when I got into trouble, I got out of trouble. \"Obviously, holing a wedge shot was probably the highlight of the day. But I just really plotted my way around. When I missed, I missed in the right spot. I'd like to get a little bit tighter as we go around Pebble, but at Spyglass 6 under may be the best I ever shot around here, so, very pleased.\"\nScheffler's strugglesFor the second straight week, Scheffler will attempt to mount a comeback from 10 strokes down across the final 54 holes of a tournament. While at the WM Phoenix Open he was upended by one hour out of an otherwise decent round, Scheffler's first round at Pebble Beach was more of a slow bleed. He missed birdie chances from 8 feet on Nos. 1-2, connected from that distance on No. 4 and then gave it back from 4 feet on No. 5. A birdie flew onto his scorecard on the par-5 6th after nearly finding the surface in two, but that was his last birdie until the last hole of the day.\nIn between them, Scheffler continued to struggle with the putter -- he missed a par putt from just inside 3 feet on No. 12 -- but it was the iron play that was uncharacteristically poor. He lost about 2.50 strokes on approach, ranked 73rd in the 80-man field in that category and failed to give himself looks from hole high consistently -- a rarity in his game.2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am updated odds, picksOdds via DraftKings SportsbookKeegan Bradley: 8-1Chris Gotterup: 19/2Sam Burns: 10-1Ryo Hisatsune: 13-1Matt Fitzpatrick: 17-1Rory McIlroy: 17-1Jake Knapp: 18-1Patrick Rodgers: 18-1For those wondering, Scheffler is listed at 35-1, a far cry from the 3-1 price tag at tournament open. No suggestion either way here, but a 65 seems certain on Friday. McIlroy may ultimately be the guy, though, as he left so many strokes out there on the greens and still managed to beat the scoring average on Spyglass by a couple of strokes. The return to his blades looked like a smart move, at least on Thursday.\n            ",

The game is being held Sunday afternoon at the Clippers' Intuit Dome, and with a few days to go, the rosters have been fully set now with injury replacements named. The league has changed the format once again in 2026, with a USA vs. World format featuring three teams in a round-robin tournament. Twenty-eight players in total were named All-Stars this season as Spurs guard De'Aaron Fox joined the ranks Thursday as an injury replacement.The format will consist of a mini-tournament, where each team plays each other once to determine who will face off in a title game. There will be a USA Stars team and a USA Stripes team to split up the American talent, while Team World will have all the international NBA talent.Some liberties were taken in dividing up the roster to even up the numbers. For instance, Karl-Anthony Towns, who was born in New Jersey but has played for the Dominican Republic national team, will be on Team World, although he also could've been placed on one of the two USA teams. The same goes for Norman Powell, who was slid over to Team World to replace the injured Giannis Antetokounmpo after first being placed on USA Stripes. Powell, born in San Diego, has played for the Jamaican national team. As far as the schedule goes, USA Stars -- made up of the younger American All-Stars like Scottie Barnes, Cade Cunningham and Tyrese Maxey -- and Team World will face Team World in Game 1. The winner of that matchup will face USA Stripes -- made up of American vets like Kevin Durant, LeBron James and Kawhi Leonard -- in Game 2. The loser of Game 1 will then also play USA Stripes in Game 3. At the end of the first three games, the two teams with the best record will face off in Game 4 to determine the champions. If there is a three-way tie, point differential will be used to determine the two teams that will advance.Here are the rosters for all three teams:\n2026 NBA All-Star Game rostersUSA Stars USA StripesTeam WorldScottie BarnesJaylen BrownGiannis Antetokounmpo (injured)Devin BookerJalen BrunsonDeni AvdijaCade CunninghamStephen Curry (injured)Luka DončićJalen DurenKevin DurantShai Gilgeous-Alexander (injured)Anthony EdwardsBrandon Ingram (injury replacement)Nikola JokićChet HolmgrenLeBron JamesJamal MurrayJalen JohnsonKawhi LeonardAlperen Sengun (injury replacement)Tyrese MaxeyDonovan MitchellPascal SiakamDe'Aaron Fox (injury replacement)Karl-Anthony TownsVictor WembanyamaNorman PowellThe 2026 All-Star game tips off at 5 p.m. EST on NBC and Peacock.

    "body": "\n        A new era of Pac-12 football is near with the rebuilt conference set to debut this fall. The eight-team league announced its 2026 schedule on Wednesday, which features a round-robin slate and a unique \"flex\" matchup for each team in Week 13. That flex week could prove instrumental in determining the College Football Playoff picture as the Pac-12 seeks to establish itself as the preeminent Group of Six league and send one of its members to the 12-team tournament.The modest size of the reimagined Pac-12 creates a reality in which teams cannot play more than seven conference games. Maintaining a three-game nonconference slate with a bye week leaves one unclaimed date on each squad's schedule, and it is with that open slot that the Pac-12 will introduce the flex games.The flex week introduces one repeat matchup per team. Every program will play a Pac-12 team it faced earlier in the year, but importantly, the Week 13 rematch will not count towards conference standings. Last year effectively provided a trial run of this format, as Oregon State and Washington State played a home-and-home wherein the first game counted as an official Pac-12 contest and the second was a non-conference battle.Here is everything we know about the Pac-12 flex week and what it could mean for the conference's CFP outlook.\nFlex week gives Pac-12 unique advantage in CFP raceAs with every other Group of Six conference, the Pac-12 aims to produce one of the five highest-ranked league champions in college football to secure an automatic bid into the CFP. Pairing two former power conference programs in Oregon State and Washington State with five top-flight Mountain West schools and a rising Sun Belt contender gives this league a bevy of potential playoff hopefuls.The flex week allows the Pac-12 to assess late in the season which of its teams have the most realistic paths to the CFP and to dynamically adjust their schedules to increase their odds of earning berths.Say Boise State stands at No. 15 in the CFP rankings in mid-November and that no other Group of Six teams are in the top 25. The Pac-12 could hand the Broncos a highly winnable matchup in the flex week to ensure they remain undefeated.\nOr perhaps Fresno State is in a battle with teams from the American and Sun Belt and needs a marquee win to set itself apart. The conference could pit the Bulldogs against the second-best team in the league in hopes that they win and boost their profile.Furthermore, since the flex game is a nonconference matchup, the top two teams in the league can lose in Week 13 and still participate in the Pac-12 Championship Game. That offers some margin for error where a highly regarded team could still qualify for the CFP as a conference champion even with a late-season loss.Pac-12 flex week stipulationsWhile the Pac-12 has complete authority over which teams play which in Week 13, it still must abide by one key rule with regard to game locations. That is, teams are guaranteed at least six home games in total and four against conference opponents. Since half of the league will only play three conference home games, the other half is guaranteed to play at home during the flex week.\nColorado State, Fresno State, Utah State and Washington State will host their flex games regardless of their opponents.Additional considerations could come into play in determining the matchups, but there are no guarantees. The Pac-12 specifically noted in its schedule release that it will attempt to prevent repeat road trips. For example, since Boise State has a road game at Fresno State in Week 6, the league would try not to force the Broncos to play the Bulldogs at Valley Children's Stadium again in Week 13.Projected Pac-12 flex matchupsThe Pac-12 announced four projected matchups for Week 13. These contests follow the aforementioned criterion of no team playing two road games against the same opponent.\nBoise State at Utah StateTexas State at Colorado StateSan Diego State at Fresno StateOregon State at Washington StateIn practice, the conference will likely need to be lenient when it comes to repeat road trips. Any deviation from these projections will almost certainly force at least one team to play a second game in an away stadium.When will Pac-12 flex games be determined?Flex games will be finalized no later than six days ahead of kickoff. That makes Sunday, Nov. 22 the deadline to announce the Week 13 pairings. Matchups could be determined before that date, though.One disadvantage of this deadline is that the Pac-12 must set its flex games prior to the Week 13 CFP Top 25 rankings release. That is less than ideal since the conference aims to use the flex week to better position its playoff contenders, but the Week 12 rankings and results should help the conference to make an informed decision.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        After an offseason of trade speculation, the Philadelphia Phillies are cutting ties with Nick Castellanos. Castellanos has been released, the team announced Thursday. The Phillies will owe him his $20 million salary this season minus the prorated portion of the $780,000 league minimum if/when he signs with another club.Castellanos, 34 next month, is coming off a career-worst season in 2025. He hit .240/.294/.400 with 17 home runs and bumped heads with manager Rob Thomson at times. On Thursday, Castellanos admitted to bringing a beer into the dugout after being removed from a game last June. Add in right field defense that borders on unplayable, and Castellanos was a minus-0.6 WAR player in 2025. All told, he put up only plus-0.8 WAR in four seasons with the Phillies. POBO Dave Dombrowski indicated the Phillies would look to move Castellanos at the outset of the offseason, though his salary and declining production made that difficult.  The Phillies waited as long as possible -- position players report to camp Monday -- to see whether a team would take on even a small part of Castellanos' salary in a trade, which didn't happen. That was always going to be a challenge. It was clear the Phillies were ready to move on. Interested teams knew he would be available as a free agent eventually. \nPhiladelphia signed Adolis García to a one-year, $10 million contract earlier in the offseason to replace Castellanos. They are similar hitters with power and plate discipline issues, though García is a much better defender. If nothing else, he will be an enormous defensive upgrade in right field. Thomson's regular lineup will look something like this: SS Trea Turner, RHBDH Kyle Schwarber, LHB1B Bryce Harper, LHB3B Alec Bohm, RHBLF Brandon Marsh (LHB) and Otto Kemp (RHB)RF Adolis García, RHB2B Bryson Stott, LHBC J.T. Realmuto, RHBCF Justin Crawford, LHBOnce he clears release waivers, Castellanos will be free to sign with any team for the prorated minimum. The San Diego Padres were said to have interest in Castellanos in the offseason, though they recently signed Miguel Andujar to be their DH. The Toronto Blue Jays could show interest after losing Anthony Santander to shoulder surgery, though George Springer is locked in as the designated hitter. Non-contenders like the Chicago White Sox and Washington Nationals might be Castellanos' best shot at a job in the short-term. The better move would be waiting until spring training games get underway and seeing whether injuries create any needs league-wide. Right now, it doesn't appear there would be much demand for a sub-replacement level DH. \nThe Phillies went 96-66 and won the NL East last season, then were eliminated by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLDS. Castellanos started three of the four NLDS games and went 2 for 15 in the series. \n            ",

Just a day after the San Antonio Spurs agreed to release him, Sochan plans to sign with the New York Knicks for the remainder of the season after he clears waivers, ESPN's Shams Charania is reporting.Sochan, 22, was the No. 9 overall pick out of Baylor in 2022, back when the Spurs were very much in a rebuilding mode. At times placed into a sort of point-forward role as a developmental project with defensive promise, Sochan showed glimpses but generally struggled to find consistency. He averaged 11.0 points on 43% shooting as a rookie and 11.6 points on 44% shooting in his second season.\n        \n            \n                NBA standings predictions: Projecting 1-15 in each conference with two months left in regular season\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLast year, he had his most efficient season, scoring 11.4 points per game on 54% shooting. But persistent perimeter shooting woes -- he's a career 29% 3-point shooter -- came to a head this year, especially with rookie Carter Bryant's emergence. Sochan appeared in just 28 games (zero starts) for the Spurs this season, averaging 12.8 minutes and 4.1 points. He appeared in just two of San Antonio's last 12 games before his release.The Knicks targeted the 6-foot-8 Sochan at the trade deadline but couldn't get a deal done, per SNY's Ian Begley. Given his defensive versatility and athleticism, he could end of figuring into New York's rotation, even for just certain matchups. Even if he doesn't, New York is in essence simply taking a flyer for a young player with upside; Charania reported Sochan had 10 potential suitors.\nNew York is 35-20 this season, third in the East and a half-game behind the Boston Celtics for second. The Knicks also added defensive-minded guard Jose Alvarado at the trade deadline.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        One of the top NFL storylines this offseason is the saga between the Las Vegas Raiders and their star pass rusher, Maxx Crosby. The five-time Pro Bowler was shut down by the franchise in December due to a knee injury -- a decision Crosby \"vehemently\" disagreed with, according to Jay Glazer of Fox. After the way that situation was handled, Crosby is reportedly going to reevaluate his future with the organization. There has been some mixed messaging with this situation. Glazer for example believes Crosby's time with the Raiders is over, but Crosby has not requested a trade, and is in a \"great place\" with the team, according to NFL Media. However, according to Albert Breer of The MMQB, the Raiders have a lot of work to do to repair their relationship with Crosby. And his frustration with the franchise reportedly goes all the way to the top.\"There's a lot of fence-mending that's going to need to happen if the Raiders are going to hang onto Maxx Crosby,\" Breer said on NBC Sports Boston. \"It goes all the way to the top of the organization with Tom Brady and Alex Guerrero. The way the communication happened with the injury in December left a mark. This is a guy who's incredibly loyal to the Raiders organization, wanted to spend his entire career there, and is loyal to Mark Davis as well. Now, he feels betrayed.\"\n        \n            \n                Maxx Crosby mock trades: Five blockbuster deals that could shake up the NFL\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nYou may recognize Guerrero's name. He's been connected to Brady since his New England Patriots days as a trainer and former business partner. Now, Guerrero is listed on the Raiders' official website as the team's wellness coordinator where he \"oversees several departments to ensure and enhance the health and well-being of players, coaches, and staff.\"\nAccording to Breer, a lot of people in the organization report to Guerrero now, and he's viewed as the \"eyes and ears\" of Brady.  Where he comes into the equation with Crosby is that Guerrero was apparently part of communicating to the star pass rusher that he was being shut down. This \"really angered Maxx,\" Breer said.  Crosby also reportedly had a \"strong suspicion\" that the reason he was shut down was for the Raiders to tank for the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. Vegas was successful in doing so. \nCrosby has refused to address the noise surrounding him, saying recently on the \"Let's Go!\" podcast that he's focused on his family and training. \n\"My focus has been on getting healthy because that's all I can control right now,\" Crosby said, via NFL.com. \"That's all that matters to me is being with my daughters and being with my wife and taking care of myself. People are gonna have rumors.\"I just looked at my phone -- I've been working all morning. Everyone's hitting me up, 'Did you say this?' I can't control that. You earn that as a player. If I wasn't doing the right things and if I wasn't the person and player I was, people wouldn't be talking about all the nonsense. But that's what comes with it. If you have drama, if you have a losing season, they just try to throw gasoline on the fire and make things a certain way.\"New Raiders coach Klint Kubiak was introduced earlier this week, and he was able to meet with Crosby -- who apparently was the first player in the building working out. Kubiak could play an important role in soothing whatever tensions may exist between Crosby and the Raiders. \"We want him to be a part of our success going forward, theres no doubt about that,\" Kubiak said. \"He's one of the best players in the NFL. That's a no-brainer, to get to work with Maxx and see him continue to have success with this organization.\"Crosby is indeed one of the best players in the NFL regardless of position. Since entering the league as a fourth-round pick out of Eastern Michigan in 2019, he has recorded the most tackles for loss (133), the fifth-most QB hits (164) and sixth-most sacks (69.5) while playing the most snaps among all defensive linemen (6,112). Breer says a \"bunch of contenders\" will have interest if Crosby is made available for trade. It remains to be seen if Vegas will do that. \n            ",

    "body": "\nThe Los Angeles Lakers don't want to enter the NBA All-Star break on a sour note. They have the perfect opponent lined up to prevent such an occurrence.Los Angeles (32-21) looks to avoid a third consecutive defeat when it hosts the struggling Dallas Mavericks (19-34) at 10 p.m. ET on Thursday at Crypto.com Arena. The Lakers won the first two contests of their eight-game homestand but lost the next two and hope to avert their third three-game losing streak of the season in their final outing before the league pauses for a week.They'll have good chance to do that against the Mavericks, who are in the midst of an eight-game slide that began on Jan. 24 with a 116-110 home setback against Los Angeles. It was Dallas' fourth consecutive loss to the Lakers and second this season, as it also was beaten 129-119 at Crypto.com Arena in late November.Two other games are on Thursday's NBA schedule, including a matchup that has the Portland Trail Blazers (26-29) visiting the Delta Center in Salt Lake City to take on the Utah Jazz (18-37) at 9 p.m. ET. The Trail Blazers attempt to bounce back from a 133-109 loss to the Timberwolves in Minnesota on Wednesday that halted their three-game winning streak, while the Jazz seek their season-high third straight victory a day after routing the Sacramento Kings 121-93 at home. Portland won the first two meetings between the teams this season.There is an abundance of games on the college basketball slate, one of which is a Missouri Valley Conference clash between Northern Iowa (16-9) and host Belmont (22-4) at 9 p.m. ET at the Curb Event Center in Nashville. The Panthers are seeking their fourth consecutive triumph while the Bruins hope to rebound from an overtime loss at Bradley on Monday that ended a nine-game winning streak that began on Jan. 7 with a 78-65 victory at Northern Iowa. Another compelling contest is a MAAC showdown that has Marist (16-8) visiting Lawler Arena in North Andover, Mass. to square off against Merrimack (16-9) at 7 p.m. ET. The Warriors, who posted a 68-55 win at Marist last month, are pursuing their fifth straight victory and the Red Foxes aim for their fifth in six contests.The Lakers are 7.5-point favorites against the Mavericks in the latest consensus NBA odds, while the Trail Blazers are 8.5-point favorites over the Jazz. Belmont is a 4.5-point favorite against Northern Iowa and Merrimack is a 3.5-point favorite against Marist.Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Thursday, Feb. 12. All times EasternNBA best bets, where to watchTrail Blazers at JazzTime: 9 p.m. | Location: Salt Lake City | TV: NBA League Pass | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Jazz +8.5 (-109) | Expert: Under 239.5 (-110, Matt Severance)The Jazz have split their last six games, and they were competitive in the losses over that stretch as each setback was by seven points or fewer. They'll likely put up another good fight against the Trail Blazers, who posted a two-point victory when they visited the Delta Center earlier this season. The SportsLine Projection Model thinks so, as the Jazz cover the spread in 64% of its simulations. SportsLine expert Matt Severance (14-7, +616.5 on his last 21 NBA picks) likes the Under to hit, even though Utah is the worst defensive team in the league.Mavericks at LakersTime: 10 p.m. | Location: Los Angeles | TV: Prime Video | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine pick -- Model: Lakers -7.5 (-109)While Luka Doncic (hamstring) remains sidelined, LeBron James is expected to be back in the lineup after sitting out Los Angeles' 136-108 home loss to the San Antonio Spurs on Tuesday. The Mavericks have lost eight straight and likely will have their minds on how they'll spend their week off during the All-Star break. Each of Dallas' last four defeats were by nine or more points, and the SportsLine Projection Model doesn't see the Mavs keeping this contest very close as its simulations say the Lakers cover the spread 67% of the time.CBB best bets, where to watchMarist at MerrimackTime: 7 p.m. | Location: North Andover, Mass. | TV: ESPN+ | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Marist +3.5 (-110) | Expert: Merrimack -3.5 (-108, Chip Patterson)The Red Foxes have gone 4-1 since suffering back-to-back double-digit losses three weeks ago, with the lone setback during the stretch was by three points. One of those double-figure losses was a 68-55 defeat against the Warriors, so don't think that revenge won't be on the Red Foxes' minds. The SportsLine Projection Model believes they'll definitely put up a good fight as the Red Foxes cover the spread in 65% of simulations. SportsLine expert Chip Patterson is leaning the other way, however, as he feels Merrimack will take care of business and cover as it improves to 9-0 straight up and 8-1 against the spread at home.Northern Iowa at BelmontTime: 9 p.m. | Location: Nashville | TV: ESPN+ | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Over 138.5 (-113) | Expert: Northern Iowa +5.5 (-114, Larry Hartstein)The Panthers are the top defensive team in the nation as they are allowing an average of 60 points per game. That's exactly how many they gave up last Monday in a victory against Murray State, which leads the MVC with an 85.3 points per game average. But can they come up with another strong effort versus the Bruins, who scored 78 points in the first meeting between the schools and are second in the conference at 83.4 points per game after recently posting back-to-back 103-point performances? The SportsLine Projection Model doesn't see Belmont reaching triple digits on Thursday, but it simulations say the Over hits more than 74% of the time. SportsLine expert Larry Hartstein (6-2, +385 on his last eight spread picks involving Northern Iowa) feels the Panthers will cover in this matchup, something they did five of the previous six times they've been underdogs this season.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        UEFA Women's Champions League returned to action with the knockout phase playoffs, and the first-leg fixtures delivered decisive results but also left the door open for others. Defending champions Arsenal traveled to Belgium to face tournament underdog favorite OH Leuven and defeated the home side, 4-0, in a ruthless display of their recent top form. Real Madrid visited Paris FC and weathered the storm in the French capital with a 3-2 come-from-behind victory. Wolfsburg and Juventus offered a captivating look at how anything can happen in the Champions League. Juventus, led twice, only to let victory slip in the final minutes of stoppage time, and settled for a 2-2 draw. Meanwhile, Man United cruised to a convincing 3-0 win at Atletico Madrid.Here are some takeaways from the first-leg matches:Arsenal's return to formThe Gunners might be fourth on the table domestically and now contending for a spot in the UWCL quarterfinals, but they're looking like the team that no one wants to face right now. For Arsenal, their 4-0 win against OH Leuven was a performance that reminded everyone that they're returning to form at the perfect moment. Despite an inconsistent league phase that kept them out of the top-four quarterfinal spots, the group also picked up a fourth consecutive clean sheet. It shows off a run of defensive prowess and clinical attacking that all but implies the title holders are peaking at the right time. \n\"They're making my job so easy, man, this retirement life is great. When your old team is doing phenomenally well, they just keep winning. And look still early stages, right? We just got knockouts, but I think you guys summed it up really well, and I'm glad we get to continue the conversation, because they're a joy to watch right now,\" former Arsenal defender Jen Beattie said on CBS Sports' post-game coverage.\"To break down a team that plays in a low block takes a lot of patience, and I think when a lot of rotations are in a squad, we spoke about this before, it's hard to get [those] connections. And I think it was a really professional performance, and one that is really confident going back playing at the Emirates, knowing you've got that level of occasion.\"The blowout win by the Gunners reflected their current form and the gap between a team that's the reigning title holders and tournament debutants. Arsenal generated 2.67 xG from 19 shots, while Leuven managed just 0.14 xG from five attempts, and a brace by Frida Maanum and relentless efforts by Olivia Smith, who also scored a goal, paced the winners.\nSmith led the team with the most touches in the box (16) and a match-high five shots. She also won eight duels and completed six of 10 dribbles. Unfortunately, a late yellow card for time wasting means she'll miss the second leg, but Arsenal look well on their way to a quarterfinal meeting against Chelsea FC. Manager Renee Slegers' adjustments have paid off with four consecutive wins in the Champions League, and she'll have to make them again for the next leg.\"I'm still close with the girls still playing, and everything that you would want from a manager, I always think as a player, you just wanted to know what your role was. I think that was the key to a happy camp ... When you're playing for a top team, you never know what 11 is going to come up in the team sheet. And I generally think that competitiveness is why everyone wants to play for a top team. So it's the communication. I think she's [Slegers] very, very direct. I think that she doesn't go off on tangents when players go and ask for explanations of why certain things might be happening,\" said Beattie.\n\"The more directness that someone can tell you exactly where you stand, and I think their plans have been exceptional ... They just have this versatility about them. And I think coming up to the business end of the season, as I love to call it, is where you have to be playing against so many different teams. They're going to come at you in different ways. And to be versatile in those moments are really key. So, I think she's used her squad phenomenally well and been direct and communication of how she's handled every single character in there\"\nReal Madrid hang on for decisive game at homeIf Arsenal's display was one of successful dominance, Real Madrid's was a nervy ride that needed resilience to get through. The Spanish side had never defeated Paris FC in Champions League competition, and it nearly looked like things were trending in history's favor after just ten minutes when the Parisians got on the scoreboard first thanks to Kaja Korosec's volley. \n\"Real Madrid showed a really good game. I think both of these teams have a lot of tenacity, and you cannot write them off. Even Paris FC getting a goal late into the match, trying to claw their way back at home, I think, gives them extra motivation, in a way,\" said Darian Jenkins on CBS Sports. \n\"This is a team that's never lost to Real Madrid until now, they're gonna want that back. And I think when you're a team like Paris FC, use that as motivation, but the game is still open. It almost feels like a draw, in a way. It doesn't feel like a full win, just because the game was so choppy and back and forth.\"The back-and-forth continued during the match before Real Madrid leveled just before halftime, with newly appointed Scotland captain Caroline Weir tipping the momentum in Madrid's favor. Colombian international Linda Caicedo maintained the tempo and ultimately delivered the game-winner for the visitors. For her crucial intervention, Caicedo earned Player of the Match honors. The 20-year-old has four goal involvements in her last five tournament appearances. Her run of form is a strong example of how she's evolving into the game-changing star that the club signed at 18. Despite Caicedo's heroics, there was a final jolt of nerves when Paris FC's Maeline Mendy reduced the deficit with a goal and gave the team a lifeline heading into the second leg. \n\"When you're up three one, and then you get scored on the last minute of the game, you're still winning three two. But it does feel like, 'Oh, I didn't, maybe I didn't do enough.' And I think Real Madrid might be feeling that way, but I think they also have to look at the positive side of this. They're winning 3-2. They're going home with an advantage. They finally broke that spell. They beat Paris FC, and they're playing well, defensively they just have to be better,\" said Janelly Farias.\"I think it's just they're being passive. Maybe they're being complacent, like individually, giving the ball away, someone gets a shot from long range, like little details. I think as a defender, if that's your primary role, you want to block the shot. You want to step to the player with the right timing. You want to not let the player turn if the cross comes in; you want to block the cross. I think it just comes down to them wanting it that much more. They have the quality, they have the talent. Now they just have to want it that much more, not just when they're in the final third, not just when they're attacking, but when they're defending their own goal.\"Wolfsburg and Juventus duke it out for a drawJuventus had a chance to deliver an upset in Germany and instead will settle for no advantage in the second leg against Wolfsburg. \nThe Italians took control of the game early, thanks to Ana Capeta, the club's January signing from Benfica. A near-post finish in just her second start with the team got them going. Juventus frustrated Wolfsburg with their defensive shape, and were unafraid to get physical at times, which further annoyed the German side for large stretches of the game. Capeta was a key component for Juventus' successes, and played provider on the go-ahead goal just past the hour mark for Amalie Vangsgaard's header. It was a game-stopping moment, with the home crowd at AOK Stadium going silent and upset watch was on.Unfortunately, Juventus are no strangers to letting game leads slip away, and Wolfsburg took advantage of a game-changing moment. Janina Minge converted a penalty in the 82nd minute to cut into the deficit, and heartbreak for the Italians followed in stoppage time. \nSarai Linder nailed a world-class finish at the death, getting on the ball 20 yards out and striking a curling ball inside the far post to end the match, 2-2.\nWhile both sides will have an even slate during the second leg, it's hard to ignore that this was one that got away for Juventus. The Serie A side were five minutes from defeating a European giant on their own turf, and instead, they leave Germany with a draw that feels like a defeat. A missed opportunity, and they'll have to carry the weight into Turin.Manchester United keep putting up clean sheetsManchester United's defense is part of their Champions League DNA, and their first-leg knockout phase match was another reminder at Atletico Madrid's expense. \nUnited center back Maya Le Tisser is a major factor on the backline. Alongside centerback partner Dominique Janssen and in front of U.S. women's national team goalkeeper Phallon Tunis-Joyce, Le Tisser came up with big shot blocks in the second half to maintain United's lead. \n\"Manchester United are known for their clean sheets in the WSL and the Champions League. I think the way that they've shot out in the top side and kept those really low scoring games has been really key to their center back painting. Of course, American [Phallon] Tullis-Joyce in the net, we love to see it, but the center back painting for me, for sure. Dominique Janssen and [Maya] Le Tisser are really key, staying connected, organizing everyone in front of them. So key for tonight,\" said Beattie.\n\"She's one of the most underrated center backs in European football, and I think it is because of her age and lack of caps for the Lionesses, but then you're talking about other strong Lionesses, England internationals that play ahead of her, Alex Greenwood, Leah Williamson, players we know very well. Maya Le Tisser is that next top center back in Europe.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Now that the Super Bowl is over and it's seven long months until NFL action resumes, bettors are left with a couple of options. Some are taking a deep breath, perhaps calculating their profits and losses from the NFL season on a spreadsheet, celebrating or lamenting their luck from Super Bowl 60 wagers and perhaps preparing to turn their attention to another sport for the time being. Others are already exploring what NFL bets for next season they can make now. For this camp, DraftKings Sportsbook already has posted live 2026 NFL future odds for all potential division winners. This option not only provides a needed alternative to Super Bowl futures wagers, which historically are about the only such NFL future offered this time of year, but this market has proven to be a gold mine for NFL handicappers and bettors who have a talent for accurately pegging the projections of teams in the parity-heavy NFL. This past season serves as a prime example of the volatility in the NFL divisional winner futures market. The Philadelphia Eagles (-160) were the only favorite in the eight division races to reward their supporters as they repeated as NFC East champions with an 11-6 record. The seven others featured underdog winners, including two worst-to-first turnarounds. Those milestones were achieved by the New England Patriots (+550), who went from 4-13 to 13-4 on their way to a Super Bowl 60 appearance, where they were drubbed 29-13 by the Seattle Seahawks, and the Chicago Bears (+600), who conquered the talent-rich NFC North at 11-6 in their first season under Ben Johnson and reached the Divisional Round of the playoffs. It stands to reason that this upcoming season will likely feature at least one similar turnaround, and now is the best time to scalp potential value despite the uncertainty surrounding the NFL Draft and free agency that concerns all 32 clubs. However, even if you lean toward playing chalk, the good news is that zero teams come with a hefty price tag. The Eagles (-110) are the only repeat favorites, while the Ravens (-110) and Bills (-115) carry discount price tags to win their respective divisions. The following are the current DraftKings odds for every 2026 NFL division winner: Place NFL futures bets at DraftKings and get bonus bets:AFC East 2026 divisional oddsBuffalo Bills -115New England Patriots +115 New York Jets +2000Miami Dolphins +2000 AFC North 2026 divisional oddsBaltimore Ravens -110 Cincinnati Bengals +210Pittsburgh Steelers +450Cleveland Browns +1200 AFC South 2026 divisional oddsHouston Texans +160  Jacksonville Jaguars +180Indianapolis Colts +350Tennessee Titans +750AFC West 2026 divisional oddsLos Angeles Chargers +175Kansas City Chiefs +175Denver Broncos +210 Las Vegas Raiders +3000 NFC East 2026 divisional oddsPhiladelphia Eagles -110 Dallas Cowboys +475 Washington Commanders +500New York Giants +700 NFC North 2026 divisional oddsDetroit Lions +160 Green Bay Packers +185 Chicago Bears +350 Minnesota Vikings +700 NFC South 2026 divisional oddsTampa Bay Buccaneers +115 New Orleans Saints +340 Atlanta Falcons +400 Carolina Panthers +425 NFC West 2026 divisional oddsLos Angeles Rams +155 Seattle Seahawks +160San Francisco 49ers +250 Arizona Cardinals +5000Initial sleeper/value leans:Here are our initial value/sleeper picks for each NFL division:AFC East, Patriots (+115): Of course, it's an inherent contradiction to call a Super Bowl participant a \"sleeper,\" but we can put the Patriots in the value category. This is one division in which we can safely rule out the massive underdogs and, though it could be a mistake to disrespect Josh Allen and the Bills, we weren't wild about their head-coaching hire in Joe Brady and the embarrassing public fallout amid the firing of former coach Sean McDermott that suggested organizational dysfunction. We'll take the plus-money price on the more stable team that appeared to be at least one year ahead of schedule with its memorable run to the Super Bowl. AFC North, Bengals (+210): For better or worse, Zac Taylor is the lone returning AFC North coach. Quarterback Joe Burrow's late-season return from injury showed that the Cincinnati offense still has immense upside. If the franchise can make the necessary moves to field a simply serviceable defense, the opportunity is there for the Bengals to take advantage of a division that is otherwise filled with transitional franchises. AFC South, Jaguars (+180): In their first year under coach Liam Cohen, the Jags were among the biggest surprises amid their 13-4 finish and playoff appearance. We understand that the elite defensive profile of the Texans, who finished the regular season with nice consecutive wins, is why they are the slight chalk. But as their playoff struggles illustrated, they could be facing a dilemma at quarterback while Trevor Lawrence and friends are likely to take another step forward. AFC West, Chiefs (+170): Last year, the Chiefs experienced regression with their record in close games and saw their season lost amid an injury to quarterback Patrick Mahomes. While this is far from a confident bounce-back spot for a club that has some areas to address, we still like the principle value of backing Mahomes and coach Andy Reid to return to prominence in the tight division, and the price overlay is a lot more enticing than the -250 or so tag that came with them for the past several seasons. NFC East, Giants (+700): The Giants appear to have the most promising profile to follow in the footsteps of the Patriots and Bears for a worst-to-first turnaround. They immediately nabbed the best coach in the division as winners of the John Harbaugh sweepstakes and, with a franchise quarterback in place, a strong defensive line and last-place schedule to feast upon, the needed elements are present. Moreover, the Eagles are shrouded in instability amid a new, unproven offensive coordinator and the uncertain futures of stars such as mercurial wideout A.J. Brown. NFC North, Bears (+350): The Bears appeared to be just hitting their offensive peak as the playoffs approached, and another step forward could make this club as potent as the one Johnson led while he was with the Lions. Their leaky defense is a major concern, but we've often seen one or two personnel changes or an adjustment in scheme make a huge difference for a specific unit. We expect the Lions, who swept the Bears last year, to return to relevance, but the price is nice for backing Chicago to continue its upward trajectory. NFC South, Falcons (+400): This club underachieved relative to its talent level the past two seasons and new coach Kevin Stefanski, who led the Browns to the playoffs in his first year with the franchise, could be poised to exploit the NFL's most vulnerable division. The recent legal troubles of breakout rookie defensive end James Pearce Jr. (he's currently facing five felony charges) is a massive concern for a defense that made major strides last season. Even so, this team should have enough talent to threaten for the NFC South title. NFC West, Seahawks (+160): With all due respect to the possibility of the proverbial Super Bowl hangover, it still stands to reason that the this division will likely come down to a Week 17 or 18 showdown for the Seahawks against the Rams or 49ers. This club has proven to answer the call in such spots under coaching wunderkind Mike Macdonald and, as such, we're tipping our proverbial hats by not fading the Super Bowl champions in their quest to repeat. Sign up with DraftKings and start earning bonus bets today:\n            ",

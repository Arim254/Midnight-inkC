    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL playoffs are down to the final four teams, with the 2026 Championship Round NFL schedule taking place on Sunday. Both No. 1 seeds will host, though one is a favorite and one is an underdog, per the Championship Round NFL odds via DraftKings Sportsbook. Seattle is giving 2.5 points to the Rams in the NFC title game at 6:30 p.m. ET, and the Seahawks have made the Super Bowl in each of its three previous times being a top seed. However, the first Super Bowl participant will come from the AFC Title Game at 3 p.m. ET, and the top-seeded Broncos are 5.5-point home underdogs to utilize in Championship Round NFL picks.Of course, Bo Nix (ankle) being done for the year has much to do with this Championship Round NFL spread as Denver's new starting quarterback, Jarrett Stidham, hasn't thrown a pass in two years. The Broncos do have the rest edge, and Drake Maye had four total fumbles plus an interception against Houston last week. Thus, there's lots to consider before making any NFL playoffs bets for the title games. All of the updated Championship Round   NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Championship Round   NFL picks now.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters the AFC and NFC Championship Games on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now, it has turned its attention to the latest Championship Round NFL odds and NFL betting lines and locked in betting picks for every NFL matchup. Head here to see every pick. Top Championship Round   NFL predictionsOne of the model's strongest Championship Round   NFL picks is the Under (42.5) hits in Patriots vs. Broncos at 3 p.m. ET. Denver has been an underdog five times this season, and the Under has hit in four of those games. Meanwhile, the Pats have failed to reach the total in four of their last six games as an away favorite. With Nix out, the Broncos' offense will take a step back, but Sean Payton will also adjust his game plan and run the ball more to eat up the clock. For the Pats, Maye has looked shaky during the postseason with six total fumbles (three lost), two interceptions and getting sacked 10 times across two games. Thus, many New England drives end up in kicks, or turnovers, which prevents the scoring running up. The model has the teams combining for 40 points as the Under hits in well over 50% of simulations. See which other teams to pick here, and bet the Under using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nHow to make Championship Round   NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in both games of the Championship Round   NFL schedule, and it has two A-rated picks, including one versus the spread. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine.So what NFL Championship Round picks can you make with confidence, and which A-rated picks should you lock in now?

    "body": "\n        After an abbreviated stop in Hawaii, the 2026 PGA Tour schedule tees off the West Coast Swing with The American Express 2026 beginning on Thursday at the Pete Dye Stadium Course in La Quinta, Calif. After skipping the one-week Hawaii Swing, World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler is set to make his debut as part of The American Express 2026 field. The four-time major winner hasn't played particularly well in this event, however, recording just one top-10 finish in five tries. The first tee times come at 11:30 a.m. ET, with Scheffler beginning at 12:14 p.m. ETThe 2026 American Express odds list Scheffler as the +300 favorite (risk $100 to win $300). Ben Griffin, ranked No. 8 in the world, is next on the PGA odds board at +2000, with Robert MacIntyre and Russell Henley at +2200 and Ludvig Aberg at +2500. Patrick Cantlay and Sam Burns, both at +2700, are the only other golfers getting lower than +3000.Before locking in any 2026 American Express picks, or making any PGA DFS picks on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up over $8,000 on its golf betting picks since that point, nailing tournament after tournament.\nThis same model has also nailed a whopping 16 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- as well as this year's PGA Championship and Open Championship. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting sites. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Now that the 2026 American Express field is locked in, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard. \n2026 American Express predictions One major surprise the model is calling for at The American Express 2026: Sam Burns, one of the favorites, stumbles and barely cracks the top 10. He's a golfer to avoid at La Quinta this week. Burns had some highlights in 2025, including finishing T7 at the Tour Championship after a strong playoff run. There were also some low points as well like going nine straight tournaments without a top-20 finish, including three straight missed cuts in that run. He has a pair of top-10 finishes at The American Express, but no top-5s, and he finished T29 last year, so the model doesn't like him as a top contender this week. See who else to fade here. Another surprise: The model calls Matt Fitzpatrick a top-four contender this week despite being a +3500 longshot. He's a golfer to target if you're looking for a big return. This will be his debut at The American Express, but he finished 2025 strong with four top-10 finishes in his last six events. He finished the season 34th in Strokes Gained: Total and 30th in Strokes Gained: Putting, making him a golfer to target with slightly longer odds this week. See who else to pick here. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:\nHow to make 2026 American Express picksThe model is also targeting three other golfers with odds of +2700 or higher as top-10 contenders. You can only see the model's picks here. Who will win the 2026 American Express, and which longshots will stun the golfing world?

Chicago will receive two players in exchange: infielder Luisangel Acuña and pitching prospect Truman Pauley.For Chicago, the trade continues what's been a long rebuilding process that's yielded some historically terrible on-field results. With the young talent received in their recent trades in place or trickling into the majors, the goal for the White Sox now shifts to possible contention in the coming seasons. For Robert, he gets a new start as a reclamation project of sorts in New York, where he joins an outfield likely to also include Juan Soto and top prospect Carson Benge.Robert, 28, has tools aplenty and a deserved All-Star selection to his credit. However, injuries and inconsistency at the plate have impeded what at one point looked like a star career in the making. The last two seasons, Robert has bottomed out to a .223/.288/.372 (85 OPS+) batting line, though he is two years removed from hitting 38 home runs, and center fielders who can do that are rare.Poor 2024-25 slash line aside, Robert is still more than capable of manning center and he still adds value on the bases (33 stolen bases in 2025). As well, Robert finished this past season strong, hitting .298/.352/.456 in 31 second-half games around a hamstring injury. We have seen flashes of the player who received MVP votes in 2023 these last two years, just not often enough. \nRobert is the latest notable addition in a Mets offseason that has also seen them obtain infielders Bo Bichette, Marcus Semien, and Jorge Polanco, as well as relievers Devin Williams and Luke Weaver.The White Sox declined to trade Robert at the deadline and instead picked up his $20 million club option for 2026. There is another $20 million club option in his contract for 2027. With a $2 million buyout, it's an $18 million decision, and $18 million could be a bargain if Robert stays healthy and performs well next season.  On the White Sox's end, they'll try to coax better play at the big-league level from Acuña. The 23-year-old has hit .248/.299/.341 (82 OPS+) in 109 career games. He was considered a quality prospect at one point, however, and he's seen action at various infield positions and in the outfield.\nPauley, 22, was the Mets' 12th-round draft pick last summer. He appeared in three Florida State League games as a professional, walking more batters than he struck out while delivering a low-to-mid-90s fastball, a cutter, and a pair of breaking balls from a lower release point than his 6-foot-2 frame suggests.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        For the first time in 11 years, the NFL's top-scoring offense and No. 1 defense will meet in a conference championship game as the Los Angeles Rams and Seattle Seahawks go to war for the NFC crown.Rams quarterback and MVP candidate Matthew Stafford needs to bring his best against the Seahawks, who split regular-season with Los Angeles. Seattle arrives on a seven-game winning streak, including a 38-37 overtime thriller against the Rams.Stafford thew for 457 yards and three touchdowns in that matchup.\"As good a defense as we faced all year,\" Stafford said on this week's Let's Go! podcast. \"They've got four guys they rotate on the outside, on edge rushers. They've got guys in the middle that are really, really talented players. Second-level players are great. Ernest (Jones IV) is having a hell of a year. And then in the secondary, they're long and fast and aggressive. It's a swarming group.\"The No. 1 scoring offense is winless against the No. 1 scoring defense when they meet in the conference championship or Super Bowl since 1990, according to NFL.com. The Seahawks are 7-2 at home, including a 41-6 pasting of the San Francisco 49ers in last weekend's NFC Divisional Round.\n\"It is as good an atmosphere as there is in football,\" Stafford said. \"I can't imagine the NFC Championship not just exceeding those expectations. They do a great job of creating that home-field advantage. And you gotta go play in the elements there with their crowd and all that goes along with it but really, you're playing against the guys on the grass and that's as talented a football team as you'll see in the NFL. They've got a great roster top to bottom. I think they're really well coached. They play fast and physical.\"The Rams reached their first conference title game since winning the Super Bowl in 2021. Los Angeles posted consecutive road wins in the playoffs after beating the Carolina Panthers and then the Chicago Bears in overtime.\"I just try to enjoy the team that I'm on and the moment that I'm in,\" Stafford said. \"I love coming to work. I love the group that we get to do it with. These, like I said, opportunities don't come every single year, so I just try to live in 'em and cherish 'em when they're here. \n\"I sure hope it's not my last opportunity, but we'll see. You never know. Take these games and these seasons one at a time and figure it out from there. But I just know that I'm happy in the moment that I am right now doing what I'm doing.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Major League Baseball's offseason continues to wind down, with just three weeks remaining until pitchers and catchers report for camp across sites in Arizona and Florida. That doesn't mean teams can just take it easy until then, however, since several top free agents remain unsigned, including left-hander Framber Valdez and outfielder Cody Bellinger. Below, CBS Sports has compiled all of Wednesday's most notable murmurs and moves in one spot for your convenience.Mets land RobertThe Mets and White Sox agreed to a three-player swap late Tuesday night that was headlined by outfielder Luis Robert Jr. In return, the White Sox acquired utility player Luisangel Acuña and right-handed pitching prospect Truman Pauley.Cardinals interested in outfielderCount the Cardinals among the clubs to show interest in veteran outfielder Austin Hays, per the New York Post. Hays, 30, spent last season with the Reds. In 103 games, he batted .266/.315/.453 (105 OPS+) with 15 home runs and seven stolen bases. Throughout his career, he's been more effective against left-handed pitchers, posting an .819 OPS with the platoon advantage (as opposed to a .717 mark without). \nThat platoon split makes Hays a sensible target for a Cardinals roster that, as of the moment, features several left-handed outfielders and corner players, including Alec Burleson and Lars Nootbaar. \nIn addition to the Cardinals, Hays has been linked to the Yankees, Mets, and other clubs throughout the offseason.Twins, Red Sox make tradeThe Twins have acquired infielder Tristan Gray from the Red Sox in exchange for minor-league catcher Nate Baez, the teams announced Wednesday morning.\nGray, 29, has appeared in 47 big-league games to date in his career, most recently appearing in 30 contests with the Rays in 2025. Although he's only posted a 77 OPS+, he has shown a feel for making authoritative contact, as demonstrated by his 46.8% hard-hit percentage. (The league-average is around 40%.) He figures to compete for playing time on the Minnesota infield.\nBaez, 24, hit .278/.371/.423 in 96 games last year across High- and Double-A. He's a former 12th-round pick by way of Arizona State University. \n            ",

Before turning the page to 2026 and another year of sorting the sport's best teams, the college football rankings receive one final update.Voters in the CBS Sports 136 -- our comprehensive ranking of every FBS team -- had not submitted ballots since the day after the CFP field was announced. This final update accounts for each team's closing statement, whether it was a playoff run like Indiana's or Miami's, or a bowl result when applicable. Full-season resumes were weighed, along with those final nonconference data points that help separate teams against comparable peers.It should come as no surprise, then, that Miami made one of the most significant jumps in the rankings. The Hurricanes reeled off consecutive wins against Texas A&M, Ohio State and Ole Miss before falling by six points to Indiana in the title game. That surge pushed Miami up eight spots to No. 2, buoyed by strong -- though not unanimous -- support for the CFP runner-up as the nation's second-best team. Indiana, unsurprisingly, finished as the unanimous No. 1.Ohio State, Ole Miss and Oregon followed at Nos. 3-5, though there was little consensus on that order. Each posted an average ballot ranking between 4.0 and 4.8. The Buckeyes received credit for their regular-season résumé despite a one-and-done CFP appearance, while the Rebels and Ducks were rewarded for runs to the semifinals.\nNotre Dame remained one of the most polarizing teams after opting out of the postseason. With no additional results to evaluate, voters made only minor adjustments, slotting the Fighting Irish at No. 8 -- up one spot from their pre-postseason ranking.Further down the rankings, a logjam emerged among fringe top-25 teams. No. 22 Arizona through No. 28 Navy were tightly grouped in the balloting, while more substantial movement occurred deeper in the CBS Sports 136. Those shifts are detailed in the Movers Report, which appears below the top 25 table.College football experts from CBS Sports and 247Sports contribute ballots each week, which are averaged together for our rankings. You can see the top 25 below and 26-136 on our rankings page.\nRankTeamRecordPrevious1Indiana16-012Miami13-3103Ohio State12-224Ole Miss13-275Oregon13-256Georgia12-237Texas Tech12-248Notre Dame10-299Texas A&M11-2610BYU12-21211Alabama11-41112Oklahoma10-3813Texas10-31514Utah11-21415Vanderbilt10-31316USC9-41617Virginia11-32118Tulane11-31919James Madison12-22020Michigan9-41721Iowa9-42522Arizona9-41823Houston10-32424North Texas12-22325Georgia Tech9-422Biggest movers No. 43 Old Dominion (+10): The Monarchs closed the season with a 24-10 bowl win against a South Florida team that carried significant regard among voters throughout the year. Context includes the absence of the Bulls' coach and starting quarterback, but there is little appetite to penalize Old Dominion for a 10-win season in which two of its three losses came against CFP teams -- including eventual champion Indiana.No. 2 Miami (+8): Miami's path to the top of the rankings included wins against teams voters ranked No. 3 (Ohio State), No. 4 (Ole Miss) and No. 9 (Texas A&M). Add an early-season victory against No. 8 Notre Dame and a narrow loss to Indiana, and Miami built a résumé strong enough to overcome its two regular-season defeats to Louisville and SMU.No. 44 Minnesota (+8): Voters have been relatively high on New Mexico and the Mountain West's top tier throughout the season, which meant Minnesota's bowl win against the Lobos created room for upward movement to reflect the head-to-head result.No. 30 Duke (+7): A win against Virginia in the ACC Championship Game was backed up by a Sun Bowl thriller against Arizona State, and the 9-5 Blue Devils produced enough notable head-to-head results to offset a relatively high loss total for a team in this range of the rankings.No. 48 Nebraska (-5): Matt Rhule's group lost four of its final five games and was beaten by Utah 44-22 in the Las Vegas Bowl. A midseason injury to Dylan Raiola clearly impacted Nebraska's ability to reach its ceiling in 2025, but voters had to judge the team as it finished. Three losses by 20-plus points to close the year led to a slight step back in the rankings.No. 37 South Florida (-5): As mentioned earlier the Bulls were a team that our voters valued highly, particularly after the 6-1 start with the only loss coming to Miami. But late season defeats to Memphis and Navy led to slight steps back on ballots and then the bowl loss to ODU really set up a slide for the final ranking. No. 53 LSU (-6): From Oct. 15 until the end of the season, the only power conference win for LSU was a 23-22 home win against 2-10 Arkansas. The Tigers did not quit after Brian Kelly was fired, in fact they battled in close losses to Oklahoma and Houston, but the lack of results made it easy for voters to slide the Tigers back behind other teams with better postseason showings. No. 52 UConn (-8): ACC wins against Duke and Boston College set UConn up for a decent final ranking, but 41-16 blowout loss to Army in the bowl game made it tougher for voters to fight for the Huskies as a top-50 team in the sport. Check out the rest of the CBS Sports 136: Teams ranked 26-136\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        The Golden State Warriors have a Jimmy Butler problem. It's not his fault. Injuries happen. A torn ACL is little more than rotten luck. Butler's knee bent at an unnatural angle and now Golden State's season (and really, the next handful of seasons) is suddenly on the brink of collapse. In the Warriors' first full game without Butler, they lost by 18 at home to the Raptors on Tuesday as Toronto scored 145 points.Even with Butler, the Warriors were the No. 8 seed in the Western Conference. They weren't championship contenders. Now they'll attempt to navigate life without their second-best player. That's $54.1 million in salary on this year's books going unused, with a good chunk of next year's $56.8 million going to waste as well. Do nothing and the competitive portion of the Stephen Curry era is effectively over. Do something small and you're basically just shuffling deck chairs. It's going to take something seismic to get the Warriors back on course. So let's explore the trade market. Below, we'll concoct five mock trades to help the Warriors address their Butler problem.\n        \n            \n                Stephen Curry's championship window with the Warriors has probably closed, one way or another\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThese trades are not necessarily going to be realistic. That's sort of the reality of trading super max contracts. Doing so almost always takes creativity. We're going to be applying a lot of it. We'll start slow, with somewhat plausible maneuvers. But with each trade, we're going to dial the ridiculousness scale up a level. By the end, we'll be so far off the deep end you'll forget where we started. Now enjoy the most irresponsible half-hour I've ever spent on the trade machine.\nTrade 1: Butler to for Zach LaVineWarriors receive: Zach LaVine, Dario ŠarićKings receive: Jimmy Butler, 2030 second-round pickThis is about as straightforward as a Butler trade gets. Golden State receives a player who is worse than Butler, but still valuable in LaVine. Sacramento receives a token draft asset in that second round pick, but really, just hastens its teardown by giving away a healthy player for an injured one, thus helping the Kings tank. Butler almost certainly wouldn't play a game for the Kings, either getting flipped or bought out down the line. Šarić is just here to help make the money work. Butler and LaVine both become free agents in 2027, so there's no long-term financial issue on either side.There are a number of more interesting constructions you could build with Sacramento. The Kings want Jonathan Kuminga? Great. He can go to Sacramento in exchange for more matching salary (let's say Malik Monk, though he overlaps with LaVine and some incumbent Warriors in terms of skill set) and valuable younger 3-and-D guard Keon Ellis. Would Golden State have any interest in Domantas Sabonis? Take Monk out, add some draft picks and more salary on the Golden State side (let's say Buddy Hield and Moses Moody) and baby we've got a stew going.Golden State and Sacramento are fairly customizable fake trade partners. Their salaries and needs can overlap in several ways at this point, so there are a variety of potential deals between them. Butler for LaVine is just the simplest. Would LaVine really address Golden State's needs? Probably not. The last thing they need is another small shooting guard. But he's a healthy, useful player. Butler, at the moment, is not. Better to have the wrong sort of player than no player at all, at least if that wrong player is good. It's rare to say that a Kings trade is the sanest in a set, but that's where we are.\nTrade 2: Butler for Anthony DavisWarriors receive: Anthony Davis, Klay Thompson, Jaden Hardy, Naji MarshallMavericks receive: Jimmy Butler, Jonathan Kuminga, Buddy Hield, lottery-protected 2026 first-round pickNow we're talking. Golden State had been linked to Davis in the past, but matching salary was the major obstacle. Now that Butler is out, that obstacle has been cleared. Though not helpful for Golden State, Dallas would benefit from turning a hefty three-year contract in Davis into a hefty two-year contract for Butler. The real question is figuring out everything else in the deal.The value for Dallas would be Kuminga and that lottery-protected first-round pick. Not exactly Luka Dončić, but not bad in light of the wrist injury that almost ended his season and the expensive contract extension Davis reportedly wants. Meanwhile, the Mavericks probably wouldn't mind getting off of Thompson as they pivot towards youth. The Warriors could use him as a PR stunt more than anything, especially with Davis still slated to be out until at least March. If Dwyane Wade and Miami could mend fences and reunite, why couldn't Thompson and the Warriors?Would Davis fix Golden State? Probably not, just given his own health concerns. But the cost here would be pretty minimal. Kuminga is headed out one way or another, and the lottery protection mitigates the damage that first-round pick could do. The Warriors wouldn't be encumbering themselves deep into the future with this deal, just giving away what would probably be a pick in the middle of the first round over the next few years (we'll have the pick roll over and retain the protection until it conveys, much like the lottery-protected pick Portland traded to Chicago all the way back in 2021). Nabbing Marshall as a big-wing defender to replace Butler would just be the icing on the cake.\nTrade 3: Butler for Anthony Davis... and LeBron JamesWarriors receive: Anthony Davis, LeBron James, Bronny James, Dwight PowellLakers receive: Jimmy Butler, Will Richard, 2028 first-round pick (via Warriors)Mavericks receive: Draymond Green, Jonathan Kuminga, Buddy Hield, 2026 first-round pick (via Warriors)I promised you weird trades, didn't I? We've covered Davis to Golden State. The package for Dallas would be similar, albeit with Green coming in the deal in place of Butler. That should suit Dallas just fine. He'd help them compete next season. The questions emerge on the Lakers' side of the trade.Los Angeles wouldn't just need value for James. Frankly, no 41-year-old making more than $50 million has that much of it. No, that 2028 first-round pick is really payment for renting out their cap space in the summer of 2026. As it stands, the Lakers are slated for max cap space in 2026. Make this trade and instead, they get max cap space in the summer of 2027. There's a world in which that's their preference anyway. If they can get another valuable asset they can flip in a future trade, that delay might be worthwhile. They might even be able to use Butler as an expiring contract as they pursue a star this offseason. With this trade, they'd have four tradable first-round picks by then.The Warriors sniffed around LeBron in 2023. James told the Lakers he didn't want to go. He has a no-trade clause. He could easily squash another deal. But if James wants to get paid next season, Golden State probably offers a cleaner path than Los Angeles, which might want to spend cap space on free agents and let James walk. A reunion with Davis would surely appeal to both James and his representatives at Klutch Sports, and both would surely enjoy playing with Stephen Curry.\nThere's real danger in giving away multiple first-round picks for such a short window as the Warriors. The hope is that a James-Davis-Curry trio would be so dangerous (and such a box office draw) that it would be worthwhile even if it only lasted a year or two. You could theoretically protect the picks, though the 2030 pick Golden State owes Washington complicates that idea. That's a solvable problem if it came to that, though. We're officially in 2K mode here. This would be Rich Paul's design as much as it would be the teams', but with Butler now out, it's not an idea that should be dismissed entirely out of hand.\n        \n            \n                Jimmy Butler's torn ACL ruins a Warriors season that looked increasingly promising\n                \n                    James Herbert                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTrade 4: Butler for Joel EmbiidWarriors receive: Joel Embiid, Quentin Grimes76ers receive: Jimmy Butler, Nikola Vučević, Gary Payton IIBulls receive: Buddy Hield, Kelly Oubre Jr., Andre Drummond, four second-round picks (via 76ers)We're officially in \"hear me out\" territory here. Very few teams should be open to taking the Embiid risk, but based on where the Warriors are, they're relatively high on that list if anyone truly qualifies. Yes, there is an overwhelming likelihood that injuries prevent him from playing at an MVP level ever again. But the Warriors are so far away that they genuinely need MVP-caliber upside out of the Butler salary slot. After all, they weren't true contenders even with Butler. Embiid has a higher ceiling than any other player in this mix. But in the event that he doesn't reach it, that injuries do indeed ruin the rest of his career, well, that's not the worst thing for Golden State either. At some point in the near future, the Warriors are probably going to have to tank. An injured Embiid on their books probably makes that easier.They'll be able to say they took a home run swing, but they've actually given up nothing of note. If the Warriors care about the optics of looking like they're trying but ultimately want to preserve their future, well, this is a way to do it. They'd even get Quentin Grimes in the exchange! As loaded as they are at shooting guard, the notion of a perimeter player that can shoot, dribble and defend would be very welcome right about now. If it makes the trade go down any easier, think of it as Butler for Grimes with a lottery ticket attached.\nPhiladelphia's motives are different from Golden State's. With Tyrese Maxey and VJ Edgecombe, they have a real future to build on. Embiid's long-term contract is standing in the way of that. The 76ers would effectively be paying Butler for the next 15 months as well as whatever Grimes could give them over moving forward for the right to clean up their books by getting Embiid off of them. They'd be turning the page on the Process era once and for all. With plenty of leftover draft picks, Daryl Morey could do quite a bit with that added cap flexibility, potentially building a new winner around those two young guards in the very near future. Golden State's books are far better suited to absorbing Embiid. They're basically blank after 2027.Chicago is mostly a facilitator here. The 76ers need a center, so we get them Nikola Vučević. We need to park a bit of money there as well, so the Bulls get compensated for their troubles to the tune of four second-round picks. And if Butler is able to return for Philadelphia next season? Then all the better.There's a far easier version of this trade to be made here. Butler for Paul George is a pretty easy contract match. George is healthy, but his contract goes one year longer. The Warriors pursued George in the summer of 2024. That's the simple version of this trade. The Warriors don't take on two extra years of money, only one. The 76ers don't have to give up Grimes. But the complicated one is higher upside for both sides here. ESPN's Marc Spears has reported that the Warriors don't want to add salary, so this is probably all a moot point anyway, but there's a sensible deal here if you really squint.\nTrade 5: The nuclear optionWarriors receive: Fred VanVleet, Dorian Finney-Smith, Jabari Smith, Reed Sheppard, 2029 first-round pick (most favorable of Suns, Mavericks, Rockets)Rockets receive: Stephen CurryNets receive: Buddy Hield, Gui Santos, 2030 first-round pick (top-four protected)Both of the following are probably true:The Golden State Warriors would never trade Stephen Curry unless he directly asked them to. End of story. He's their Tim Duncan or Dirk Nowitzki, an utterly unimpeachable franchise icon. He's not getting dumped in the dead of night like Luka Dončić. Fans would riot.In a purely utilitarian world in which nothing mattered except for championship equity, Curry asking for a trade would be a net positive for Golden State.Again, that second point is purely utilitarian. Warriors fans would rather watch Curry lose for them than win elsewhere. But if you believe this current group has no real championship equity, then purely logically speaking, a Curry trade potentially recouping meaningful assets is the best long-term decision because it could increase championship equity at a point in the future in which actually winning a championship is somewhat more plausible. These ideas are supposed to grow more ridiculous with each passing trade. What's more ridiculous than exploring a Stephen Curry trade? It only happens with his say-so. We're pretending we live in a world in which he's decided he'd rather win elsewhere than lose in Golden State.So who would be interested in that world? Well, everyone, honestly. But let's narrow it down. It would have to be a team equipped to win the title here and now. He's 37. He's not waiting around. He'd probably go to a team with a ton of defense and a shooting deficit, and there are fortunately plenty such contenders this year. The funniest outcome would be Oklahoma City. The Thunder have so much draft capital that if this ever became real, they could just send Golden State matching salary (say, Isaiah Hartenstein, Lu Dort and Isaiah Joe) along with a mountain of picks and potentially lock up a second-consecutive title or possible even a three-peat without really compromising their future. If Curry has any interest in chasing Michael Jordan's six rings, it'd have to be at least a little tempting. But the Thunder don't act this way, as terrifying as it would be for the rest of the league.How about Detroit? The Pistons kill opponents in the paint but struggle from deep. Curry obviously corrects that, and he'd clear out the area near the basket for everyone else quite a bit. Detroit controls all of its own first-round picks and has plenty of mid-sized salaries and young players to dangle. They're just so early in their run, it's hard to see them selling out for a player near the end of a Hall of Fame career.\nThat leaves Houston as the best fit, ironically reuniting him with Kevin Durant. The two would share a starting lineup with Amen Thompson, Alperen Sengun and Tari Eason, creating probably the best single lineup in basketball while preserving Steven Adams as a lethal bench curveball. Golden State still walks away with plenty here: Sheppard and Smith as prospects to groom for the future, plus a very valuable 2029 first-round pick. If Golden State needs more picks, Houston has a surplus to work with, and those young Rockets could be dealt for picks elsewhere if needed. A trade like this would position the Rockets as the probable 2026 championship favorite while setting Golden State up to tank for a few years and then rebuild. In a fictional world in which those are their primary goals, a trade like this makes sense.But we don't live in that fictional world. Stephen Curry is almost certainly never asking for a trade, so this exercise is purely academic. Even if the Warriors wanted to kick off a rebuild right now... too bad. If the cost of winning four championships is wasting a couple of years meandering with a mediocre roster at the end then so be it. Curry gets to decide how his story ends, and unless we hear otherwise, the assumption should be that it does with the Warriors. Still, it's tantalizing to imagine what sort of market would develop for Curry if that ever changed. I mean... it's Stephen Curry. He's probably the single easiest offensive player to fit onto any team in the history of basketball. Every team remotely interested in winning now would probably register some level of interest.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        After a wild regular season and an even crazier postseason, there are only four teams left standing in the NFL, which means there are now only four possible Super Bowl matchups still in play, so we're going to rank them. Of the four matchups that could still happen, three of them would be a rematch of a previous Super Bowl, which means there's only one matchup we could still get that has never happened (and we'll cover that later). Of the three possible rematches, all of them have happened at some point over the past 15 years: 2013: Super Bowl XLVIII (Seahawks over Broncos)2014: Super Bowl XLIX (Patriots over Seahawks)2018: Super Bowl LIII (Patriots over Rams)Note: The Rams lost to the Patriots in Super Bowl XXXVI in 2002 when they were located in St. Louis.Basically, if the Patriots make the Super Bowl, they'll be facing a team that will be out for some revenge. \nThis year's Super Bowl is being played at Levi's Stadium, which just happens to be the same building where Denver won its last Super Bowl in 2015. Speaking of the Broncos, they won't have Bo Nix if they make the Super Bowl. Nix is out for the year after fracturing a bone in his ankle during Denver's 33-30 overtime win against Buffalo in the divisional round. The loss of Nix definitely makes any Super Bowl with the Broncos a little less attractive, and we certainly took that into account with these rankings. By the way, if you still haven't marked your calendar for the Super Bowl, you should go ahead and do that now: The game will kick off at 6:30 p.m. ET on Feb. 8 and will be broadcast on NBC. So what's the best potential matchup for Super Bowl LX? Let's get to the rankings and find out.4. Seahawks vs. BroncosHypothetical point spread: Seahawks -9.5This game would give us Jarrett Stidham going up against the best defense in the NFL and I'm pretty sure we all know how that would turn out. The fact that the Seahawks would be nearly a 10-point favorite isn't surprising at all and if this game did turn into a blowout, it would actually fit a trend that's developed over the past five decades. \nOver the past 50 years, the two top seeds have faced each other in the Super Bowl 14 times, and for the most part, those games have turned into blowouts. Out of those 14 games, 10 have been decided by double digits, including Super Bowl XLVIII, when the Seahawks smashed the Broncos 43-8.One interesting storyline in this game is that it would be the Russell Wilson Bowl, and it might give future teams some confidence that you can turn your roster around quicker than you think. These two teams made one of the biggest trades in NFL history when the Seahawks shipped Russell Wilson off to Denver in 2022. It was a bold move that's already paid off for the Seahawks, because they've already rebuilt the franchise. As for the Broncos, they foolishly gave Wilson a huge contract extension following the trade, and after it became clear he wasn't working out, they decided to cut him and take an NFL record-setting dead-cap hit. If the Broncos are in the Super Bowl, that would mean they got to the big game less than 24 months after eating all the dead money on Wilson's contract. The moral of the story is that you can survive a bad trade or a bad move or a bad contract as long as you're willing to acknowledge it didn't work and quickly move on. \n3. Rams vs. Broncos Hypothetical point spread: Rams -8.5If the Broncos make the Super Bowl, they'll either have to face the best defense (Seahawks) or the highest-scoring offense (Rams), so there's really no good option for a Denver team that won't have Nix. The one upside of this game is that it's the only one still possible that's NOT a rematch. We would get a NEW SUPER BOWL MATCHUP. We actually almost got a Rams-Broncos Super Bowl in 1989. Denver advanced to the Super Bowl that year, but the Rams ended up losing to the 49ers in the NFC title game. The Broncos probably would have preferred to play the Rams since they ended up losing to the 49ers, 55-10, a score that still stands as the biggest blowout in Super Bowl history. \nThis game would also give us one very interesting storyline with Sean McVay and Sean Payton coaching against each other in a postseason game for the first time since McVay's Rams beat Payton's Saints in the 2018 NFC title game, which involved arguably the most controversial pass interference no-call in NFL history. I'm guessing we would see the replay of that no-call at least 400 times during Super Bowl week. If this game does happen, the biggest winner would be the Walton family. The Rams are owned by Stan Kroenke, who is married to Walmart heiress Ann Walton Kroenke. The Broncos are owned by the Walton-Penner group, with one of their main investors being Rob Walton, who is Ann's cousin. If we actually get this Super Bowl matchup, the NFL should just go all in and sell tickets to the game at Walmart. Besides the ownership ties, this game would also give us the Rams' high-flying offense going up against a Broncos defense that surrendered the third-fewest points in the NFL this year.\n\n        \n            \n                Prisco's NFL Championship Sunday picks: Jarrett Stidham does enough for Broncos, Seahawks lean on defense\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n2. Seahawks vs. Patriots Hypothetical point spread: Seahawks -3.5This game would be a rematch of Super Bowl XLIX, and if that happens, the NFL should just go all out and totally embrace it. They should let Marshawn Lynch handle the honorary coin toss, but have the toss at the 1-yard line, and then just before the coin is actually tossed, Russell Wilson would come in and toss it, but it would get intercepted by Malcolm Butler who would then actually toss the coin. Super Bowl XLIX was on NBC with Cris Collinsworth in the booth, and this year, Collinsworth will once again be on the call for NBC. Maybe we could involve him in the coin toss.One big reason why this game would be so attractive is because it would give us an unbelievable matchup on both sides of the ball. For one, we'd get to see AFC's highest-scoring offense going up against a Seahawks defense that gave up the fewest points in the NFL this year. Not only that, but we'd get to see the NFL's third-highest scoring offense in Seattle going up against a Patriots defense that surrendered the fourth-fewest points. \nA great AFC offense vs. a great NFC defense? A great AFC defense vs. a great NFC offense? You'd never be able to take your eyes off the game. The Patriots have forced six turnovers in two playoff games and they'd be facing a quarterback in Sam Darnold had the most turnovers in the NFL during the regular season with 20. The Seahawks would essentially have to defy recent history to win with Darnold. Since 1990, only one QB has led the NFL in turnovers and won the Super Bowl in the same year, and that was Eli Manning, who did it thanks to a miracle run by the Giants in 2007.  1. Rams vs. Patriots Hypothetical point spread: Rams -3If this Super Bowl happens, the NFL needs to cancel the MVP vote and just give the award to the quarterback who wins the game. Matthew Stafford and Drake Maye were the two MVP front-runners for most of the year, and having the season end with these two quarterbacks dueling it out with the Lombardi on the line would make this a must-watch game. \nThere's a good chance that Stafford and Maye will end up as the top two vote-getters in the MVP race this year, and if that happens, it would mark the fourth time this century that the top two vote-getters have faced each other in the Super Bowl. The only other times it happened came in 2009 (MVP Peyton Manning vs. runner-up Drew Brees), 2016 (MVP Matt Ryan vs. runner-up Tom Brady) and 2022 (MVP Patrick Mahomes vs. runner-up Jalen Hurts).In the first two games, the MVP runner-up got revenge by beating the MVP in the Super Bowl. In the third game, Mahomes became the first MVP since 2000 to win the Super Bowl (The 2025 MVP award will be handed out just three days before the Super Bowl on Thursday, Feb. 5). If Stafford were to be voted MVP and win this game, that would likely cement his status as a Hall of Famer.\nAnother reason we should want this game to happen is because it would give us two of the smartest head coaches going head to head, with offensive genius Sean McVay battling wits with defensive mastermind Mike Vrabel. The Patriots coach won three Super Bowls while playing for the Patriots, and this would give him a chance to win one for the first time as a head coach.If this Super Bowl happened, it would mark the third time the Rams and Patriots have met in the big game, tying Cowboys-Steelers as the only other Super Bowl matchup to happen three times. Vrabel was on the field as a player in the first Patriots-Rams Super Bowl, a game where New England pulled off a stunning 20-17 upset as a 14-point underdog. McVay was the Rams' head coach in the second Patriots-Rams Super Bowl, a game where Bill Belichick's defense held McVay's offense to just three points in a 13-3 win. \nThe Patriots' first Super Bowl win over the Rams kick-started their dynasty with Tom Brady and Bill Belichick in 2001. Their second win over the Rams was the unofficial end of that dynasty in 2018. Now, in a cosmic twist, Vrabel and Maye could kick-start their own dynasty with a win over the Rams. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        There are a number of reasons why Iowa State went from 16-0 to 16-2 last week -- most of them on the defensive end of the court. But somewhere on the list of things that took a dip was also Joshua Jefferson.In the loss at Kansas, he was 4 of 14 from the field. In the loss at Cincinnati, he was 4 of 12 from the field. Those performances doubled as two of his four worst shooting efforts of the season. So I was eager to see how Jefferson would respond when Iowa State returned home for the first time in 10 days to host UCF inside Hilton Coliseum on CBS Sports Network.If you watched Tuesday night, you know he was great.Final score: Iowa State 87, UCF 57Jefferson took 11 shots, made six of them and finished with 17 points, 12 assists, 10 rebounds and zero turnovers in 34 minutes. That stat-line represented the 6-foot-9 senior's second triple-double of the season and thus made him the first Iowa State player to ever record multiple triple-doubles in the same season.\n\"I'd say, defensively, he had an edge to how he played, right?\" said Iowa State coach TJ Otzelberger. \"Like he was really helping pressure and getting turnovers, and then for him, we've got to do the best job we can trying to [get into the] open the court. But when he can get a dunk in transition, and he can get a finish where the whole defense isn't loaded up, that's going to build his confidence. I think he earned that on the defensive end. And then he took a leadership position in terms of, we're going to move the ball, we're going to share the ball, we're going to keep it on the move. And, I mean, to have 12 assists and no turnovers, I mean, that's ridiculous. And not to mention the rebounds and the points. So, I'm just proud of his ability mentally to lock in on the things that are important for us to be successful, and now we just gotta work together and maintain that every night out.\"Iowa State is No. 11 in Wednesday morning's updated CBS Sports Top 25 And 1 daily college basketball rankings, where Arizona remains No. 1 for the 11th consecutive day. The only new addition to the Top 25 And 1 is Miami (Ohio), which won 107-101 on Tuesday to improve to 20-0 on the season.The Redhawks are now 26th in the Top 25 And 1.Is Miami really the 26th-best team in the sport? Man, who knows? And I know the Redhawks haven't played the toughest schedule -- but that's at least partly because they had a hard time scheduling non-league games because everybody assumed they'd be good. Either way, 20-0 against their schedule to date is still undeniably impressive -- and one way to illustrate that is to highlight that Miami's strength of record ranks 21st nationally.\nSo ... welcome to the Top 25 And 1, Redhawks! Now tell your most famous alum to stop bullying me at work, please.

You can sign up to get it in your inbox every weekday morning here. \nGood morning and happy hump day, sports fans! It's Austin Nivison greeting you on this fine Wednesday, and there is plenty to discuss. The Baseball Hall of Fame added two new members, the Chargers have a new offensive coordinator and we have picks for the NFC and AFC Championship games on deck. Let's get right into it, shall we?  ⚾ Five things to know Wednesday Carlos Beltrán and Andruw Jones were elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame. Although he had the résumé to reach the Hall of Fame sooner, Beltrán will get into Cooperstown on his fourth try. He is top 50 all-time in home runs (48th), RBI (41st), total bases (34th), doubles (29th) and extra-base hits (24th). It took nine attempts for Jones to finally reach the necessary 75% threshold after receiving 7.3% of the vote his first time, but the wait was worth it. Arguably the best defensive outfielder ever, Jones will now take his place among baseball legends. Here's what this year's vote means for other Hall of Fame hopefuls.The Chargers are expected to hire Mike McDaniel as their next OC. If McDaniel didn't get another head coaching job, he was going to be one of the hottest offensive coordinator candidates on the market, and Jim Harbaugh made is move. McDaniel is set to take the reins of the Chargers offense, replacing the fired Greg Roman. McDaniel's tenure with the Dolphins had some highs and lows, but his ability to scheme up an offense has never been in question.Duke filed a lawsuit against star QB Darian Mensah. One year ago, Duke paid up to land Mensah out of the transfer portal from Tulane, and that investment yielded results in the form of an ACC title. Mensah announced last week his intentions to enter the transfer portal, but he received pushback from the school. Duke filed a lawsuit against Mensah, arguing he broke his contract by attempting to enter the portal. If Mensah does officially hit the open market, expect Miami to be in the mix.Illinois guard Kylan Boswell will miss a month due to a hand injury. The Fighting Illini suffered a tough blow on Tuesday when coach Brad Underwood announced Boswell would be sideline with a fractured hand. In addition to being Illinois' second-leading scorer, Boswell has also become one of the best defenders at the college level. The timing of this injury couldn't be much worse with a top-15 showdown against No. 4 Purdue coming up on Saturday.Individual NCAA champion Michael La Sasso joins Phil Mickelson's LIV Golf team. Few amateurs, when presented with the opportunity to play at The Masters, would pass that up. However, La Sasso did just that when he joined the HyFlyers of LIV Golf, a team captained by Mickelson. La Sasso was the No. 13 ranked amateur golfer entering 2026 after winning an NCAA championship for Ole Miss last year. 🏈 Do not miss this: AFC, NFC Championship picks \n                                                                    Imagn Images\n                                                            With the college football season now in the books, we have just three meaningful NFL games remaining. Two of them will be played this Sunday. The Broncos and Patriots square off in the AFC, and the Rams and Seahawks go head-to-head in the NFC. It should be a terrific day of football, and our own John Breech peered into his crystal ball to make picks and predictions on each game. \nIn Denver, the Broncos have a tough hill to climb following a season-ending ankle injury to quarterback Bo Nix. Jarrett Stidham, who hasn't thrown an actual NFL pass in just over two years, will start in his place against a defense that just forced five turnovers. Think this one has all the makings of a blowout? Think again. The Broncos are hosting and their defense is more than capable of giving Drake Maye some trouble. Breech: \"Maye struggled against one of the best defenses in the NFL, and now, he has to once again play one of the best defenses in the NFL, except this time, he has to go on the road. Maye has taken a beating this postseason (he's been sacked 10 times in two games) and it could get worse this week. He took the fourth-most sacks in the NFL this year and he's facing a defense that recorded the FIFTH-MOST sacks in a single season in NFL history. I have no idea how the Patriots offensive line is going to stop the Broncos' pass-rush.\"The weather in Denver will certainly be conducive for a low-scoring defensive slugfest. The forecast calls for temperatures hovering around freezing with some white flakes coming down.  📈 College football's way-too-early top 25 for 2026 \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Congratulations to Indiana on winning its first national championship, but that's in the past, and there are only eight months until the 2026 college football season begins. With that in mind, Brandon Marcello compiled our way-too-early top 25 rankings. \nExpect the usual suspects -- Ohio State, Georgia and Oregon -- to fight for a national championship again next season. But what about the Hoosiers, the team that just flipped the sport on its head? Indiana remains in the top 10, thanks to a strong transfer class headlined by TCU quarterback Josh Hoover. Marcello: \"We doubted Indiana could replicate the 2024 season by reloading again, and yet the Hoosiers were much better. Curt Cignetti will side with a different transfer quarterback for a third straight year, snagging the nation's passing leader, TCU's Josh Hoover, to lead the offense. The transfer class included more power conference players than ever before under Cignetti, a sign that the Hoosiers are here to stay.\"For Hoosier fans hoping to bask in the glow of the 2025 season a little longer, we have you covered: Curt Cignetti cemented himself as college football's top coach.The Hoosiers issued a warning to the sport's traditional powerhouses.Where Indiana vs. Miami ranks among the best CFP title games.These seven James Madison transfers changed Indiana football forever. 👍👎 The best (and not-so-best) of the rest \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Has Steph Curry's championship window closed with the Warriors?The Knicks called a players-only meeting amidst a horrific stretch.Robert Saleh vs. Liam Coen is the AFC South's hottest new rivalry.Baker Mayfield vs. Kevin Stefanski is the NFC South's hottest new rivalry.John Harbaugh insists the Giants' new reporting structure isn't a big deal.The Packers released All-Pro CB Trevon Diggs after the briefest of stints.Alberto Mendoza, brother of quarterback Fernando Mendoza, is transferring from Indiana to Georgia Tech.Lane Kiffin says Nick Saban nudged him toward the LSU gig.Here are the undercard fighters to keep an eye on at UFC 324 in Las Vegas.Nebraska is ascending quickly in our latest edition of Bracketology.In women's Bracketology, Iowa State is squarely on the March Madness bubble.Arsenal just keeps mowing down its competition in the Champions League.A former Alabama center is suing the NCAA in hopes of a CBB return. 📺 What we're watching Wednesday ⚽ UEFA Champions League: Atlético Madrid at Galatasaray, 12:45 p.m. on CBSSN ⚽ UEFA Champions League: PSV Eindhoven at Newcastle United, 3 p.m. on CBSSN ⚽ UEFA Champions League: Pafos at Chelsea, 3 p.m. on Paramount+ ...

The Rams are now headed to the NFC Championship game for the first time since 2021, a season that ended with them winning the Super Bowl. In the NFC title game, the Rams will be heading to Seattle to face the Seahawks for the third time this season. The teams split their two regular-season meetings with the Rams winning in Week 11 (21-19) and the Seahawks winning in Week 16 (38-37). The Seahawks earned their way to the NFC Championship by absolutely destroying the 49ers in a 41-6 win on Saturday night. The Seahawks are in the NFC title game for the first time in 11 years. In the AFC, the Denver Broncos are headed to the conference title game after beating the Buffalo Bills, 33-30 in overtime, in what was easily the wildest game of the divisional round. The Broncos' vaunted defense forced five turnovers, including four from Josh Allen, who threw two interceptions while also losing two fumbles. The top-seeded Broncos will now host New England in the AFC title game with a trip to Super Bowl LX on the line. The Patriots advanced on Sunday after beating the Texans, 28-16. The Broncos and Patriots are facing each other in the AFC title game for the third time in 13 years. The two previous meetings were both played in Denver and the Broncos won both of them. If the Broncos are going to get to the Super Bowl this year, they're going to have to do it without Bo Nix, who suffered a season-ending ankle injury against Buffalo. For the Patriots, it will mark their first trip to the conference title game since 2018 in what ended up being the final appearance by Tom Brady and Bill Belichick. With that in mind, let's take a look at the full playoff schedule.Divisional Round scheduleSaturday, Jan. 17(1) Broncos 33-30 (OT) over (6) Bills. The Broncos have had one of the best defenses in the NFL all year and Josh Allen found out firsthand why they're so good. The Bills turned the ball over five times with four of those coming from Allen. The Bills QB threw an interception in overtime that set up Denver's game-winning drive. Bo Nix also came up big for the Broncos, throwing for 279 yards and three touchdowns in the win. (1) Seahawks 41-6 over (6) 49ers. Rashid Shaheed returned the opening kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown and this game was essentially over after that. The Seahawks defense absolutely suffocated the 49ers, forcing three turnovers while sacking Brock Purdy twice. They also kept San Francisco out of the end zone for the second straight time after also holding the 49ers without a touchdown in Week 18. With Sam Darnold dealing with an oblique injury, the Seahawks put their offense in the hands of Kenneth Walker, who rushed for 116 yards and three touchdowns. Sunday, Jan. 18(2) Patriots 28-16 over (5) Texans. The Texans' defense was the best in the NFL all season, but it was the Patriots' defense that stole the show in this game. The Patriots forced five turnovers, including a pick-six from Marcus Jones in the second quarter that gave New England an early 14-10 lead. Drake Maye had some fumbling problems, but he also came up with some huge plays, including a 32-yard touchdown pass to Kayshon Boutte in the fourth quarter that iced the win. The Texans are now 0-7 in the divisional round in franchise history and are the only team in the NFL that has yet to make it to the conference title game. (5) Rams 20-17 (OT) over (2) Bears. The Rams pulled off a dramatic win that wasn't decided until Harrison Mevis drilled a 42-yard field goal in overtime. The only reason the game made it to overtime is because Caleb Williams threw a miraculous 14-yard touchdown pass on fourth down with under 30 seconds left to play. The Bears looked like they were going to pull out the win in overtime, but Williams threw an interception that set up the Rams' game-winning drive. Championship SundaySunday, Jan. 25\nAFC ChampionshipPatriots at Broncos, 3 p.m. ET (CBS, Paramount+)NFC ChampionshipRams at Seahawks, 6:30 p.m. ET (Fox; Fubo, try for free)Super Bowl LXSunday, Feb. 8AFC champion vs. NFC champion at Levi's Stadium (Santa Clara, California), 6:30 p.m. ET (NBC)Wild Card resultsSaturday, Jan. 10(5) Rams 34-31 over (4) PanthersRams vs. Panthers recap: The Panthers almost pulled off the upset, but they couldn't stop Matthew Stafford with the game on the line.

    "body": "\n        As it turns out, the \"slow market\" everyone was complaining about a few weeks ago might have just been a result of MLB teams … taking time off for the holidays. Yes, things were slow around the turn of the new year, but we've had a flurry of legitimately huge news stories come around in the past week or so. First, Kyle Tucker signed with the Dodgers on a four-year contract that will pay him $240 million – and potentially land him back in the first round of Fantasy drafts, if you ask Scott White. The Mets then pivoted from Tucker to sign Bo Bichette, a move that carries some risk for Fantasy with a park downgrade, though Bichette should benefit from two things: Hitting behind Juan Soto and Francisco Lindor; and making an expected transition to third base, giving him a bit of positional flexibility at arguably the two weakest spots on the infield. We then saw J.T. Realmuto re-sign with the Phillies, and Josh Lowe traded to the Angels, two moves Scott White also covered in the Offseason Tracker, which you can and should read here. And then on Tuesday night, we got another big move … well, it's a big name, at least. The Mets traded for Luis Robert from the White Sox, which fills their center field hole … with a guy who might not actually be an upgrade over Tyrone Taylor.Okay, fine, Robert is probably an upgrade over Taylor. But Taylor's 84 wRC+ over the past two seasons is actually identical to Robert's mark in that same span. You can make a case that Robert has been held back by a terrible White Sox team, except that team was significantly more competitive in 2025 than 2024, and Robert was almost exactly as hopeless as he was the year before. It seems unlikely that Robert is just totally finished as a productive MLB player at 28, and the ceiling he showed in 2023 – remember, he had 38 homers and 20 steals in just 145 games – will have Fantasy players continuing to chase him. \nBut I was iffy on his 130.6 ADP in NFBC drafts to date, and that number seems all but certain to rise as a result of this signing. And, given how little he's shown over the past two seasons, I just can't really get on board with that.It's possible Robert has a big bounce-back season, but I'm not betting on it. In fact, in the rest of today's newsletter, I'm talking about three different categories of breakout for 2026, and \"Bouncebacks to buy\" are exactly one of those categories. And spoiler alert: Robert didn't make the list! As for the other two categories of breakout I'm writing about today, let's go with a couple of examples: One for a player who needs to make the leap to superstardom to justify the breakout tag and another who just needs to make the jump to stardom. \nOn the one hand, you've got someone like Eury Perez. He's already being drafted as if he's proven to be a reliable Fantasy option, even if he hasn't quite been that just yet. Through his first 186.2 innings of work, Perez has a 3.71 ERA and 10.3 K/9, which is solid enough, but that's also come across two separate seasons separated by a full year in between them after he underwent Tommy John surgery in 2024. Perez has shown potential, and that potential is already enough to justify a 95.3 ADP in early drafts – a price that I suspect is only going to rise from here. Which is to say, Perez doesn't need to just be as good as he has been so far to justify his price; he needs to get better. Potentially a lot better. It's a bet that I'm willing to make in Perez's case. Let's not forget this: Despite making his MLB debut three years ago, Perez won't even be 23 years old under a few weeks after Opening Day – for context, that makes him younger than two of the three top pitching prospects in Scott White's Top 100 Prospects column, and he's only a few months older than Trey Yesavage, the third. He's held his own as a major-league pitcher despite being one of the youngest players in the league, and he was solid last season despite coming back from Tommy John surgery. Pitchers who are this good this young tend to become aces. It's mostly just a question of when. \nThen you go down the rankings a bit, and you've got Chase Burns. Burns isn't significantly cheaper than Perez, with an ADP sitting at 125.5, but that does reflect the difference between how Fantasy players are viewing them. There might be similar upside, but Burns is less of a sure thing than Perez. But that also means he doesn't have to hit quite as high a ceiling as Perez to justify his draft cost. Perez probably needs to make the leap to being a top-50 player, maybe even a top-25 one, to really end up being a big win; if Burns ends up a top-75 player in 2026, that's a pretty big win, on the other hand.And, of course, Burns might be a whole lot better than that. He was arguably the top pitching prospect in baseball when he made his debut last summer, and while there were some growing pains, there were also some flashes of brilliance, most notably when he matched the MLB best mark with three straight starts with at least 10 strikeouts; he would follow that streak up with another 10-start outing two starts later. Burns' home park and team context won't help him out much, but with that kind of bat-missing upside, he could follow his teammate Hunter Greene's footsteps to become one of the most dominant pitchers in the game, even without much help from his surroundings.I think Burns has that kind of upside, but even if he doesn't get there, I think he could justify this price and this tag. If he's more like a high-3.00s ERA pitcher with a ton of strikeouts but some headaches along the way, that's still a totally fine outcome given Burns' price, even if it would be at least mildly disappointing for Perez.\nThere's the difference. Now, let's get to the breakouts: Breakouts 1.0The bounce-back candidatesHe had a bad month. If you're wondering why Alvarez went from three straight seasons of an OPS of at least .959 to last year's .797 mark, that's it; one bad month. When he went on the IL in early May, he was hitting just .210/.306/.340; after he returned, he hit .369/.462/.569. There was nothing concerning at all in his underlying numbers, and he put those numbers up while playing through and then returning from a misdiagnosed hand fracture. Yes, he's missed a lot of time over the years with injuries, but even that looks like more of a fluke for 2025, when he had the misdiagnosed hand injury and then suffered an ankle sprain – his previous injuries were typically to his knees, but that hasn't really been an issue for him in a couple of years. In terms of pure skill as a hitter, I think Alvarez is in the Aaron Judge/Juan Soto/Shohei Ohtani tier, and now you can get him in the third or fourth round in most drafts. He'll remind anyone who has forgotten why he's a first-round caliber player in 2025. Jackson Merrill, OF, PadresWhen Merrill went on the IL with a concussion in mid-June, he was hitting .304/.349/.474 and was on pace for 19 homers, 96 RBI, and 88 runs. Was it exactly what you drafted him to be? No, we were hoping for more power, and just one steal in 44 games was certainly disappointing. But you weren't really complaining about him at that point, either (especially since the lack of speed could be easily explained by a hamstring injury). Merrill was cleared to return shortly after going on the IL, but clearly wasn't the same guy for the next couple of months, as he hit .219/.286/.354 in his next 47 games before going on the IL with an ankle injury in mid-August. It's that stretch that made Merrill such a disappointment, and even a .946 OPS in September couldn't fully save his season. I know nobody likes to talk about excuses, but it sure seems like Merrill has a few pretty good ones. Being a major-league hitter is hard enough, let alone while being younger than most prospects still toiling away in the minors. We know Merrill has a terrific swing that can combine for both tons of contact and tons of hard-hit balls, and we know he's a plus athlete. This is a 22-year-old who everyone was convinced was going to be a top-25 player (at least!) for the next decade (at least!) this time a year ago. Buying the dip here is one of the easier calls on the board. \nDylan Cease, SP, Blue JaysPersonally, I don't like roller coasters. When I went on a road trip with some friends after we graduated high school, two of them went to Cedar Rapids, and I stayed at our motel in Sandusky, Ohio, eating dinner at the world's saddest Ruby Tuesday's. Why? Because I know Cedar Rapids is all about the roller coasters, and I'm not a fan. Why spend my money going on a bunch of rides I know I won't like?That's what life with Dylan Cease is like. If you've got the stomach for it, it can be a thrilling experience, but I know for many of you at this point, he might be persona non grata in drafts coming off a 4.55 ERA – his second time in three years with an ERA north of 4.50. And I don't blame you – even during his good seasons, there are often stretches where it feels like it's hurting you more than it's helping to have Cease around. I get the criticisms. But I also don't think they are entirely fair. In 2023, Cease struggled and deserved to struggle, pitching to an ugly 4.16 xERA that mostly matched his actual 4.58 mark. But the comparison to 2025 falls apart when you dig past the ugly ERA he shared in both seasons. His strikeout rate was 2.5% higher in 2025, while his walk rate was a tad lower, and his results on balls in play were quite a bit better. That's how you get an xERA of 3.46, compared to 2023's 4.16. \nThat doesn't mean Cease will pitch that well, much less that you'll enjoy the experience of having him on your team. But it's a good sign that his skills didn't actually atrophy – as is the fact that the Blue Jays aggressively jumped out ahead of the market and signed him to a $210 million deal to kick off free agency. If they're that confident in him, why shouldn't I be? Cease can be frustrating, but he's just about the best bet for strikeouts in the game (five seasons in a row of at least 210), and has a pretty good chance at 15-plus wins if he gets a bit better luck this time around. Sandy Alcantara, SP, MarlinsIf you didn't notice, I can't blame you, but Alcantara's bounce-back may have already happened in 2025. After closing out the first half with a trio of disastrous starts where he allowed 18 runs in 17 innings, Alcantara more or less immediately turned things around at the All-Star break, ultimately putting up a 3.33 ERA in his final 13 starts. The strikeout rate wasn't quite where we want it to be at 21.3%, but he did lower the walk rate to 6.0% from 9.0% – the strikeout rate was also a 4% improvement. Alcantara's stuff remains very impressive, and once he got his command back, he looked a lot like the guy who was one of the most dependable starters in baseball. Expect him to build on last year's 174.2 innings and push to be one of the few 200-inning pitchers in baseball, with an ERA a lot closer to what he managed in the second half of the season.The superstar leapRoman Anthony, OF, Red SoxFull disclosure: I toyed with putting Anthony on my \"Busts\" list. There are a lot of ways things could go wrong for a second-year bat being drafted near the top-50 without any real stolen base upside, and it requires him to take a step forward to justify that price. \nBut, ultimately, I think he's going to take that step. Let's start with where Anthony left things off as a rookie: in 71 games, he hit .292/.396/.463, showcasing an impressive command of the strike zone, at least plus raw power, and enough present-day skills as a hitter to put up a 183-run-plus-RBI pace. And that's without his swing being geared for tapping into the raw power consistently. And even that is something Anthony started to show signs of figuring out, as he put up a .407 xwOBA over his final 100 plate appearances, which would have been a top-five mark among all hitters in 2025. There's no guarantee Anthony will reach those highs, but he's certainly capable of it. It's hard to become a first-rounder for Fantasy if you don't consistently steal 15-plus bases, and Anthony's swing and home park aren't set up to make him a 30-homer threat, yet. But the baseline level of skills here is so high that I can't really see things going that poorly for him. And the upside looks something like a healthy Yordan Alvarez season. Samuel Basallo, C, OriolesBasallo might be in that weird spot where, if he had just stayed down at Triple-A destroying baseballs, his price might actually be even higher than it is right now. That's because, just days after turning 21, the Orioles called him up to the majors, where he struggled, hitting just .165/.229/.330 in 31 games. Nobody is out on Basallo because of those struggles, but there's a bit less hype than there likely would have been if all we saw was his .270/.377/.589 line in Triple-A – a line, mind you, that made him the fifth-best hitter in the International League while also being the youngest player in that league to even reach 300 plate appearances. \nThe breakout call doesn't have much to hang on from his time in the majors, as Basallo naturally looked pretty overmatched. And, as is often the case with young catchers, it might take him a while to figure things out against MLB competition. But the upside here simply cannot be ignored. He put up a 94.2 mph average exit velocity (with a max of 115.9, both elite marks) at Triple-A without striking out even 24% of the time, and he did it while putting that power into action in games, hitting 23 homers in just 76 games. He should be in the lineup most days at either catcher or DH and has the upside to be the No. 1 player at the position if all goes right. As a No. 2 catcher, he's well worth the risk. Cade Smith, RP, GuardiansAll that's left, really, is to see Smith do it for a full year as the closer. He has two seasons under his belt in the majors with a 2.42 ERA and 35.1% strikeout rate, but we only have a few months of him actually serving as the closer to go on. I have no concerns about his ability to live up to the job, and I think his ceiling is as high as literally any reliever in baseball on a Guardians team that has consistently created enough save volume for 40-plus saves. He has the opportunity; now all he has to do is go out there and take advantage of it. The star leapJackson Holliday, 2B, OriolesI wish I had something concrete to point to with Holliday to explain the enthusiasm. He was much better in 2025 than 2024, but he also struggled mightily down the stretch, putting up just a .641 OPS in the second half. When you look under the hood, nothing really stands out, either good or bad – he's got a pretty good sense of barrel control and pretty good approach at the plate, but he comes out right around average in most plate discipline measures, including strikeout and walk rates. Similarly, his quality of contact metrics all pretty much come out to average or perhaps even a tick below. If we're just going based on what Holliday has shown at the MLB level, there really isn't very much to get excited about.\nThe argument here is more for the men of faith than our men of science, in other words. Holliday was the top prospect in baseball not long ago, and he has 857 plate appearances through his age-21 season, one of those 17 players with that many PA at that young of an age. It's worth noting that, among that 17, Holliday ranks just 16th in OPS+ through his age-21 season, ahead of just Elvis Andrus and directly behind Delmon Young. Young never quite figured it out, though he did hit .290 as a 22-year-old and eventually had a 100-RBI season while hitting .298 in 2010; Andrus would go on to be a Fantasy stalwart, though more for his speed than his bat outside of a few double-digit homer seasons. Getting this much playing time at Holliday's precocious age doesn't guarantee superstardom, in other words. But he more or less held his own in the majors last season, at a time when most prospects, even very good ones, are just being challenged for the first time in the high-minors. Including Holliday here requires a leap of faith. But it's a kind of bet that often works out. Luke Keaschall, 2B, TwinsHere's what it comes down to: I believe in the speed. Keaschall is fast (85th percentile sprint speed), but more than that, he's opportunistic. He knows how to get on base, he knows when to pick his spots, and at least last season, he had a blaring green light. And that was true both in the majors, where he ran at a 45-steal pace, and in Triple-A, where he had a 64-steal pace. I don't think it's realistic to expect anything like a 60-steal pace over a full season, but 40 seems like a reasonable expectation at the top of the Twins lineup. The biggest question I have about Keaschall comes down to power. Is he just a Nico Hoerner type with worse contact skills? I don't think the .302 average he had last season will prove sustainable, but I don't expect him to be a terrible source of average – he hit .294 in the minors and had a very strong 14% strikeout rate as a rookie. But he doesn't hit the ball particularly hard and, at least in the majors, didn't hit the ball to the pull side in the air often, which is how an otherwise punchless hitter would put the ball in the seats. However, there was some hope that he would develop at least above-average power back in his prospect days, especially on pull-side fly balls, and it's worth noting that he was returning from Tommy John surgery at the end of 2024 and then missed over three months with a fractured arm just a few weeks into his rookie season. There could be a bit more juice left to squeeze here, and if he has a 20-homer ceiling to go along with his speed and contact skills, we could very quickly be talking about a top-three guy at second base. Ryan Pepiot, SP, RaysThe thing about Tropicana Field is that pitches seem to move differently there, or maybe it would be more accurate to say that Tropicana Field, by dint of being the only truly domed stadium in baseball, is the part where pitches move the way they are supposed to in a neutral environment. Everywhere else, you've gotta deal with changes in wind or humidity based on the time of day, but Tropicana is a truly climate-controlled environment, one that has always benefited pitchers. Pepiot didn't really suffer from the year he pitched in Steinbrenner Field, going from a 3.60 ERA in 2024 to a 3.87 mark in 2025. But he lost a couple points of strikeout rate, mostly because his four-seamer was just a bit less effective than it had been the year before, when he was pitching at Tropicana. Where he'll be pitching roughly half his games in 2026. You get where I'm going with this. Because Pepiot is so reliant on his four-seamer for success, he might be uniquely well-suited to pitch in Tropicana, where he has a 28% strikeout rate for his career. And now he's back there with another year of development under his belt and no reason to think the Rays will play any games with his innings after he got to nearly 170 in 31 starts last season. I expect the best season of Pepiot's career in 2026. \n            ",

Let's take a look here at some of the biggest current names. I'd like to start, though, by examining three very interesting names right now, given the seasons that these guys put up in 2025. Tarik SkubalSkubal won the American League Cy Young in both 2024 and 2025, making him the first repeat AL winner in more than two decades. Coming off his age-28 season, he's set himself up pretty well to possibly win a third Cy Young; every pitcher who has done that so far is either in the Hall of Fame (Randy Johnson, Greg Maddux, Steve Carlton, Pedro Martinez, Jim Palmer, Tom Seaver, Sandy Koufax), is connected to PED (Roger Clemens) or isn't yet eligible for the Hall (Clayton Kershaw, Max Scherzer, Justin Verlander).\nFurther, the only pitchers to have won two Cy Youngs before their age-29 season are Clemens, Maddux, Kershaw, Martinez, Seaver, Tim Lincecum, Johan Santana, Bret Saberhagan, Denny McLain and Skubal. With 54 wins, and 889 strikeouts in 766 ⅔ innings, Skubal needs to stockpile a ton more counting stats, but there's plenty of time for that. He's been the best pitcher in the world the last two seasons -- or at least neck-and-neck with the next guy we'll discuss -- and if he keeps that going for four or five more years, he'll be in great shape for the Hall of Fame.Paul SkenesHe's only made 55 career starts, but Skenes doesn't even turn 24 until May 29. He's already finished with a sub-2.00 ERA twice and won a Cy Young while having started the All-Star Game twice. He's struck out 386 in 320 ⅔ innings. It's difficult to compare Skenes to most Hall of Famers because what he's doing is in some ways unprecedented. To wit, the list of pitchers since the Deadball Era to make at least 50 starts with an ERA under 2.00 before they turn 25 is as follows: Paul Skenes.\nYeah, that's it. If we expanded our search to \"all time,\" we could add five others, including Walter Johnson. If we lowered the criteria to 30 starts, at minimum, we still don't get anyone more recent than 1913 other than Skenes. Nolan Ryan is the all-time strikeout king. He had 356 through age 23. Skenes has 386. Seaver, a young prodigy, had a 2.47 ERA (129 ERA+) through two seasons through age 23. Skenes is at 1.96 (215 ERA+). He has the eye test and fame factor too. We might really be watching something special here, right?\nCal RaleighWe just saw something special from the Mariners' catcher. He set single-season records for home runs both as a catcher and a switch-hitter. He hit 60 homers in a season! One season does not a Hall of Famer make, of course. Raleigh, though, did himself quite the favor with that monster year. He was already an above-average or even well-above-average catcher through his age-27 season. Then he went into the stratosphere at age 28. Avert your eyes from the batting average without taking into account Raleigh being a very good defensive catcher and recognizing the other factors conspiring against him, such as his ballpark. Just lock in on the 153 home runs, 376 RBI and 313 runs with 18.8 WAR heading toward his age-29 season. He's already 46th all-time among catchers in career home runs.\nI don't think Raleigh has another season even close to 2025 in him, but he doesn't necessarily need one to be a Hall of Famer. His track is through the power. Only eight catchers have ever reached 300 home runs; Mike Piazza's 427 is the only figure above 389 (Johnny Bench, who sits second). \nGiven his age, immense power, ability to avoid the platoon due to switch-hitting and skills behind the plate -- which will keep him in the lineup a lot longer than his triple slash line will say he should -- there's a decent chance Raleigh powers his way into the Hall.Now, onto the rest of the exercise.The locks: Six playersThis means any of the following players could retire right now and make the Hall of Fame. We aren't assuming things will happen in the future. No, the résumé as it stands is already Hall-worthy. Right off the top, this means any players with less than 10 years of service time can't be included, as the Hall of Fame requires 10 years. We don't need to spend much time on Mike Trout, Justin Verlander or Max Scherzer. If you don't know they are already Hall of Famers, I have no idea why you'd be reading this (though I'm still grateful, of course).Mookie Betts: He's only 33 years old, but Mookie already has four World Series rings along with an MVP, eight trips to the All-Star Game, seven Silver Sluggers and six Gold Gloves. He's a career .290/.369/.512 (135 OPS+) hitter with a batting title and has led the majors in WAR three times. There are those who won't like his counting stats -- 1,767 hits, 394 doubles, 41 triples, 291 home runs, 913 RBI, 1,166 runs and 196 steals -- but his all-around contributions have him already home for me. Keep in mind he was established as an exceptional defensive right fielder and volunteered to move to the infield, last year rating out as one of the best defensive shortstops in baseball. For JAWS purposes, he's still listed as a right fielder and is eighth all time behind seven Hall of Famers, sitting ahead of players like Reggie Jackson, Paul Waner, Larry Walker, Sam Crawford, Tony Gwynn, Ichiro Suzuki, Dave Winfield and Vladimir Guerrero. Freddie Freeman - I examined his case after the World Series. I think Freeman is safely in now.Aaron Judge - I think he's in. Sure, he hasn't hit any counting stat benchmarks (yet) and the Yankees haven't won the World Series with him around, but he's won three MVPs and has been, pretty easily, the best hitter in baseball for the last four years (.311/.439/.677 for a 209 OPS+ from 2022-25). Special Case: One playerShohei Ohtani only has eight years of service time, but I think his Hall of Fame credentials are already enough to get him in. Let's imagine -- and hope it doesn't happen, because this would suck -- Ohtani suffers season-ending injuries after one game in 2026 and then after one game in 2027 and retires. He'd still be a Hall of Famer. The only thing missing here in 2026 is his 10 years of required service time.\nOn the cusp: Seven playersIt's possible the following players already have Hall of Fame résumés, but it's also possible they wouldn't make the cut. For some, just stay the course. For others, a slight nudge forward solidifies things. To be clear, I think every player mentioned in this section is going to be a Hall of Famer. They just might not make it as things stand today. Paul Goldschmidt - His case is either complete or nearing completion. Goldy has 2,190 hits, 477 doubles, 372 homers, 1,232 RBI, 1,280 runs, 174 steals along with an MVP and is above the Hall of Fame standard, per JAWS, for first basemen (just ahead of Todd Helton and Eddie Murray). He should make it, but it isn't a slam-dunk case.Manny Machado - It's difficult to envision any realistic scenario where he doesn't make it. You could argue that I should move him up a tier.José Ramírez - I could just repeat what I said about Machado here.   Nolan Arenado - It's funny. Third base has been long known to be under-represented in the Hall of Fame, but I've got three of them listed here, and I think all three will make it. None of them, at present, are locks, though. Arenado sits 20th in JAWS at the position with Machado 18th and Ramírez 19th. Arenado is the one who has the least left in the tank on the field, too. There's a Coors Field stigma to overcome from the first half of his career, but I have a feeling his earned reputation as an all-time great defender can cancel that out.Chris Sale - Though he started slow and missed a chunk of the year due to injury, Sale last season showed he wasn't done after his first Cy Young. He's won 145 games with a 3.01 ERA (141 ERA+) and 2,579 strikeouts in 2,084 innings. I think he gets to 3,000 strikeouts and, when he does, we can move him up to the top tier.Bryce Harper - If he retired right now, he might not make the Hall of Fame, but c'mon. We all know he's headed there.Francisco Lindor - Through his age-31 season, Lindor now has five straight 5-WAR seasons, 1,664 hits, 339 doubles, 279 home runs, 856 RBI, 1,011 runs and 216 steals. He's a .273 hitter with a 120 OPS+ who plays great defense at an incredibly important position. The most statistically similar player through age 31? Cal Ripken Jr. On track: Seven playersThe following players look like they might be headed toward the Hall of Fame, but there's still a little something holding them back and that could be rectified here in the next few years. Jose Altuve: Altuve has an MVP, two World Series rings, three batting titles, 2,388 hits and one of the most prolific postseason dossiers we've ever seen. He would already be a slam-dunk Hall of Famer, but that sign-stealing scandal looms large in his case. I have no idea how it's going to go for him with voters. Beltrán's induction certainly helps his case.Giancarlo Stanton - There is just one number to watch here: Stanton has 453 career home runs. If he gets to 500, he's got a good shot to make the Hall. He's 36 years old. Will he make it?Gerrit Cole - That Tommy John surgery last year was significant. Cole is now 35. If he has a Verlander-like post-surgery career, he'll make the Hall. If not, I don't think there's enough there just yet. Cole has 153 wins with a 3.18 ERA (130 OPS+) and 2,251 strikeouts in 1,954 innings. He's won a Cy Young and two ERA titles. He's also 152nd in pitcher JAWS. Salvador Perez - Sal is now above 300 home runs and 1,000 RBI with an outstanding reputation as a leader and working with the pitching staff. He's 32nd in JAWS among catchers, sitting between Russell Martin and Brian McCann, who both fell off the ballot after one year. I think he gets a reputation boost, though, and it'll be close.Kenley Jansen, Aroldis Chapman and/or Craig Kimbrel: It's difficult to know how voters will treat the next generation of closers. Billy Wagner made the Hall, but it took all 10 years on the ballot. Francisco Rodríguez is in ballot purgatory and he's sixth all time in saves. Jansen is fourth with Kimbrel fifth and Chapman 12th. Chapman had one of the best years of his career last season. I just don't know here, other than that they'll have a decent chance to make it.Work to be done: 16 playersHere, I will point out a little bit of what needs to come next, because every player here is short of the Hall of Fame but still has a chance to get there. They just have some heavy lifting in front of them. \nAndrew McCutchen: Things are winding down for Cutch and I think he's going to fall shy, at least on the BBWAA ballot. He's a .271/.365/.457 (125 OPS+) hitter with 2,266 hits, 451 doubles, 332 home runs, 1,152 RBI, 1,290 runs and 220 steals. He won an MVP, but is 28th among center fielders in JAWS and his most statistically similar players are mostly Hall of the Very Good types (Chili Davis, Torii Hunter and Luis Gonzalez are the top three).Marcus Semien: The bad news here is that Semien is a volume player and last year had a rare injured list stint while also continuing to take a step back in his rate stats. He's now 35 with 1,613 hits, 323 doubles, 253 home runs, 801 RBI, 968 runs and 49.2 WAR. It looks like he'll end up short, but there's always the chance he flourishes in his first two years in New York and gives himself a chance.Jacob deGrom: The late start and extensive injury history probably keep deGrom out. His rate stats are ridiculous (2.57 ERA, 151 ERA+, 10.8 K/9, a 5.37 K/BB rate which is the best all time, etc.), but he still only has 96 wins and 1,851 strikeouts in 1,539 ⅔ innings. He's turning 38 years old this season.Christian Yelich: A few injuries also might've done in Yelich's chances, but he's still only 34 with a decent foundation in place. There's a good argument he was the best player in baseball from 2018-19. Since then it's been tougher sledding, but he's a .285/.374/.464 (129 OPS+) hitter with 1,741 hits, 327 doubles, 233 home runs and 221 steals. Zack Wheeler: A blood clot and thoracic outlet surgery ended Wheeler's 2025 season. He's now going to get a late start in 2026 and turns 36 in late May. He's 113-75 with a 3.28 ERA (123 ERA+) and 1,820 strikeouts in 1,728 ⅓ innings in his career. There's enough here to start with that if he somehow lasts as long as, say, Verlander and pitches like an ace, he can get to the Hall of Fame. It's just unlikely. Blake Snell: Two Cy Youngs is a hell of a starting point. He's 33 years old with 81 wins and 1,440 strikeouts, though. His path starts with at least another Cy Young and maybe two more. Then we could talk.J.T. Realmuto: It doesn't feel like he can get there, but he's above Perez in JAWS and within striking range of Yadier Molina. You never know.Xander Bogaerts: The only reason he's here is 1,822 career hits heading to his age-33 season. If he somehow gets to 3,000, we'll have to discuss. Edwin Díaz: He's 38th in career saves and is heading to the best team/organization in baseball at age 31. Watch the cases of Jansen, Kimbrel and Chapman, first, and then see where Díaz ends up for a guide. Would take a big late surge: Matt Olson, Alex Bregman, Matt Chapman, Carlos Correa, Corey Seager, Trea Turner and George SpringerStrong foundation: 13 playersThese players are several years away from consideration, but there are some who already have that \"Hall of Fame\" feel with others are building a nice little foundation. Skenes, Skubal and Raleigh all reside here. More on them above.Juan Soto: The most statistically similar players to Soto through age 26 are Harper, Ken Griffey Jr. and Frank Robinson. Yep.Ronald Acuña Jr.: He's still only 28. He won MVP in 2023 with a season for the ages. Bobby Witt Jr.: He already has 722 hits, 151 doubles, 34 triples, 105 home runs, 373 RBI, 403 runs, 148 steals and 21.7 WAR. The only Royals position players with multiple 7-WAR seasons are Witt and George Brett. Witt is 25 years old.Vladimir Guerrero Jr. - Through his age-26 season, Vlad Jr. is already over 1,000 hits with 183 home runs and 591 RBI. Fernando Tatis Jr. - The PED suspension certainly will cost him votes, but by then who knows how the electorate as a whole will feel? The numbers already pop for a 27 year old.Julio Rodríguez - He's only 25! He already has 654 hits, 112 home runs, 116 steals and 22.9 WAR. Garrett Crochet - Crochet was finally, sort of, a full-time starter in 2024 and was very good, though he was limited to 146 innings in 32 starts. Last year, he finished second in AL Cy Young voting to Skubal after going 18-5 with a 2.59 ERA and 255 strikeouts in 205 ⅓ innings. A few more of those and this becomes a pretty serious discussion.Others to watch: Gunnar Henderson, Corbin Carroll, Elly De La Cruz\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

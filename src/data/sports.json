    "body": "\n        UFC's Seattle return has its main event. Israel Adesanya vs. Joe Pyfer will headline UFC Fight Night on March 28.UFC CEO Dana White announced the fight, which streams exclusively on Paramount+, on Tuesday via Instagram. The card will also feature a pivotal women's flyweight showdown between Alexa Grasso and Maycee Barber.Former UFC middleweight champion Adesanya looks to course correct amid his first losing streak. \"The Last Stylebender\" finds himself on a three-fight skid after knocking out current light heavyweight champion Alex Pereira to reclaim the 185-pound title. Adesanya subsequently lost the title to Sean Strickland, before being finished by Dricus du Plessis and Nassourdine Imavov.Pyfer has made progress in rehabilitating his image. His reputation as an elite prospect took a hit after losing to Jack Hermansson in Pyfer's first main event. Since then, he's won three consecutive fights. A decision win over Kelvin Gastelum -- who gave Adesanya the most exciting fight of his career -- is sandwiched between Performance of the Night wins over Marc-Andre Barriault and Abus Magomedov.\nUFC visited Seattle last February, a card headlined by Henry Cejudo vs. Song Yadong. It marked the first time the promotion had visited the Emerald City in 12 years. Afterwards, White promised the promotion would be back soon.\n\"Let me tell you what, America, Seattle is an awesome city,\" White said during a post-fight press conference in February. \"The people here are amazing. We were walking around the area, lots of different people from everywhere. The shops they have here, the boutiques, the restaurants, the hotels, I forgot how awesome Seattle is. I'm so glad we came back to Seattle.\"White revealed that last year's sellout event at Climate Pledge Arena broke the UFC's North American live gate record for Fight Nights. The 18,000 attendees generated $3.84 million in revenue.\"We will not wait 10 years to come back here,\" White said.\nThe promotion has also booked former UFC women's flyweight champion Grasso against rising contender Barber. Grasso, who famously dethroned Valentina Shevchenko in the first of their three fights, is coming off a last to Natalia Silva. Barber is on a seven fight win streak, most recently beating Karine Silva at UFC 323.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        After quite a knockout stage so far, four teams remain in the Africa Cup of Nations with Senegal, Egypt, Nigeria, and Morocco set to play in the semifinals on Wednesday. Morocco may have been among the favorites to win the tournament with it taking place in their home nation, but given the performances of others around them, this will be no cakewalk despite the hot form of Brahim Diaz, who has five goals in five games played to lead the way for the Golden Boot.Morocco will be one of Africa's representatives at the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, alongside Senegal and Egypt, but for Nigeria, after failing to qualify for the World Cup, they'll be throwing everything that they can at being cChampions of Africa. With four goals and two assists, Victor Osimhen is doing everything that he can to push Nigeria forward, along with the three goals and two assists that Ademola Lookman has provided too.  Defensively, this side has some questions, but when it comes to going forward, there may not be a team on the continent that can beat them in a shootout.Senegal vs. EgyptWednesday, Jan. 14, 12 p.m. ET (beIN Sports and Fubo)This is more than just the Mohamed Salah team as Egypt prepare for their semifinal match, which will be a tough one. In fact, during the group stage, Egypt struggled to score at all, scoring only three goals during the group stage before breaking out to score six in the two knockout stage matches so far. Salah has four goals and one assist, but he has been closely followed by Omar Marmoush, who has two goals. \nFor Senegal, Salah's former teammate Sadio Mane has been thriving as a creator with three assists, but it has been a very balanced attack with three players having scored two goals. Senegal have been among the most impressive teams at the tournament, with Iliman Ndiaye and Ismaila Sarr helping balance the attack. In any given game, a new player can step up to win a match for Senegal, and they'll need just that to win their first tournament since 2021. Egypt has to go back much further for when they last lifted this trophy in 2010, but it's anyone's guess who will come out of this tie.Nigeria vs. MoroccoWednesday, Jan 14, 3 p.m. ET (beIN Sports and Fubo)It feels like the winner of AFCON will come out of this tie. Nigeria have felt unstoppable as they look to claim their first continental title since 2013, but Morocco are looking to ride home field advantage to their first title since 1976. Given their World Cup success in recent years, this doesn't feel real, but Morocco are still looking to conquer their continent and have all the quality to do so. Diaz is doing everything he can to push the Atlas Lions to the top, and he's gotten help from striker Ayoub El Kaabi's three goals and an assist. Right back Achraf Hakimi has also returned from injury to push the squad forward. Morocco haven't had a challenge that could stop them yet, but in facing Nigeria, that's where things could change.\nGiven their talent, there are few sides who have been bigger disappointments globally than Nigeria after not qualifying for the World Cup. They have been on a mission to show that they're a serious soccer side. Osimhen has been among the best strikers in the world for Galatasaray, and he hasn't missed a beat during AFCON, leading the Super Eagles, but to get past Morocco, they'll need everything to come together to near perfection.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Time waits for no one, especially at the top levels of global soccer. On Monday, Real Madrid moved on from manager Xabi Alonso, swiftly hiring Alvaro Arbeloa to be, they hope, the second coming of Jose Mourinho, and on Wednesday, they'll be right back in action in the Copa del Rey with an away trip to second division side Albacete. While it's now the round of 16 of the Spanish Cup, this is as good a draw as Real Madrid could've gotten at this stage of the tournament, especially considering that they need to balance playing in LaLiga on Saturday before Champions League play returns on Jan. 20 with Los Blancos hosting Monaco live on Paramount+.How to watch Albacete vs. Real Madrid, oddsDate: Wednesday, Jan. 14 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Estadio Carlos Belmonte -- Albacete, SpainLive stream: ESPN+Odds: Albacete +700; Draw +600; Real Madrid -455The goal is clear that not only are Real Madrid expected to win this match, but to win emphatically. In the Supercopa De España, Kylian Mbappe returned from his knee injury, and while this is a match that he may not start due to how many matches are coming in quick succession for Los Blancos. But with a week that has been a tumultuous one, the club needs anything that can take the spotlight off of Florentino Perez's power and the decision to move on from Alonso, so it's good that this match comes before a LaLiga one.Only trailing Barcelona by four points in the league, things are wide open for Arbeloa, but he'll also need to keep some of the good that Madrid were doing under Alonso. The defense was much more balanced under Alonso than they were under Carlo Ancelotti last season, and he also got Mbappe to play as a proper number nine. Resulting in 27 goals in all competitions, Mbappe will be central to any success that Madrid have.Moving on from Alonso shows that anything but a trophy is unacceptable this season, and the Copa del Rey will be Madrid's best chance at one. Already in the round of 16, it doesn't take much to be able to see a title in their future, but as long as they can get the Arbeloa   era off to a good start, it will be a job well done.\nImmense pressure is on the 42-year-old whose only managerial experience was with the Real Madrid youth teams and Real Madrid B, but he offers a change back to a world where Perez has the final say on what Madrid do. If Arbeloa   struggles, it'll open questions about whether Perez's way of running the club is still sustainable post Ancelotti, but only time will tell if that's the case.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        On Monday, Buffalo Bills coach Sean McDermott revealed wide receiver Gabe Davis tore his ACL in the Bills' 27-24 wild card round win over the Jacksonville Jaguars and Tyrell Shavers was being evaluated for a knee injury.Tuesday, the bad news continued to come in: Shavers also tore his ACL, leaving the Bills with just three healthy wide receivers on their active roster: Brandin Cooks, Keon Coleman and Khalil ShakirNicknamed \"Big Game Gabe\" for his previous playoff performances -- including a four-touchdown game against the Kansas City Chiefs four years ago -- Davis, 26, returned to Buffalo this season after spending last season with the Jaguars. He didn't make his season debut until Week 11 but quickly took a prominent role in the receiver rotation. He started five of the Bills' final eight games and finished the regular season with 12 catches for 129 yards.Davis caught two of three targets for 14 yards against Jacksonville on Sunday before taking a nasty hit to his knee early in the fourth quarter. He was helped to the sideline and then eventually carted off the field. He had played roughly half of Buffalo's snaps to that point.\nShavers, 26, had started to come on as an important piece. After catching just one pass last year, he had 15 catches for 245 yards and one touchdown this season. He also had a 14-yard catch against the Jaguars for a key first down.McDermott said Shavers suffered the injury during a punt in the first half but played through it in the second half. He called the effort \"unbelievable\" and \"remarkable.\"\n        \n            \n                2026 NFL playoff schedule and bracket: Dates, times, TV for every round from divisional to Super Bowl\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBills receiver situation vs. BroncosBuffalo has been rolling with a by committee receiver approach all season, though the members of that committee often rotate.\nShakir has been the one constant. The slot man played on 71% of Buffalo's offensive snaps against Jacksonville, the highest of any receiver. He finished with 12 catches for 82 yards; no other player had more than three catches.Shavers (54% snap share) and Cooks (48%) were next in line Sunday. Cooks had three catches for 58 yards, including a crucial 36-yarder on the game-winning drive. Cooks, a midseason addition, has been up and down in his short time in Buffalo, seemingly alternating big plays and drops.The only other receiver with a catch was Keon Coleman, who brought in his lone target for a 36-yard gain. Coleman, the 2024 second-round pick who was a healthy scratch at times this season, played 43% of Buffalo's offensive snaps. He was only active Sunday because Josh Palmer (ankle) was unable to play; Palmer was ultimately placed on injured reserve.\nWith Davis, Palmer and Shavers out, Coleman's role could increase. He's a big body (6-foot-4, 215 pounds) who has flashed the ability to win 50-50 balls but struggled with consistency throughout his brief career.The Bills also opened the practice window for Curtis Samuel, who has not played since mid-November due to neck and elbow injuries. It remains to be determined whether he will be able to play.The Bills also added Kristian Wilkerson to the practice squad Tuesday, and he joins Mecole Hardman and Stephen Gosnell there. Wilkerson has not appeared in a game this season, Hardman has appeared in just two games this season while battling injuries, and Gosnell has never appeared in an NFL game.\n            ",

The former University of Georgia standout will be seeking his sixth PGA Tour win and ninth as a professional. His last win came at last year's Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay   Hill, Fla., in March. This year's event gets underway on Thursday at 1:49 p.m. ET from Waialae Country Club in Honolulu,  Hawaii. The tournament will be played on a par-70 course measuring 7,044 yards.

He's +20000 in the outright market, and Kannon is staying away from him there and in bets like making the cut and head-to-head. \"The TCU Horned Frog has dipped to 99th in the OWGR and in five starts over the FedExCup Fall, Hoge missed the cut three times,\" Kannon said. \"In fact, dating back to the PGA Championship last May, Hoge has missed nine cuts over 15 starts on Tour. Hoge has played the Sony Open 10 times and despite a third-place finish in 2018, he has missed the cut four times. I am not banking on him returning to form just yet.\" See who Kannon is backing at SportsLine.Another golfer that Kannon is fading is Tony Finau, who is +1100. The 36-year-old turned pro in 2007 and has earned six wins on the PGA Tour, one on the Korn Ferry Tour as well as two others. He registered his last win at the Mexico Open in April 2023.\"It has been a tumultuous past year or so for Finau, battling legal issues and a golf game that saw him finish top-10 just one time in 2025,\" Kannon said. \"Approach play, Scrambling, Greens in Regulation, Putting – you name it, Finau has dropped to 125th to 150th territory in the Tour rankings across the board statistically. I imagine it will turn around for a player of his caliber, but I am not going to count on it happening just yet. In five prior visits to Waialae, Finau has missed the cut twice and never finished better than 20th.

    "body": "\n        Speaking to the media days after firing John Harbaugh, Baltimore Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti said he hopes to have a Lamar Jackson extension done by the start of free agency in March, with the goal of lowering Jackson's $74.5 million cap hit in 2026.For reference, the highest cap hit in 2025 was Dak Prescott at just over $50 million.\"I want [Jackson] to be my quarterback,\" Bisciotti said. \"... The urgency of that matters to me because we've got free agents, and I don't want to go into free agency with that hanging over our head. And I made that clear to Lamar and I think he was very appreciative of my stance and hopefully willing to work with [Ravens GM] Eric [DeCosta] and not get this thing dragged out into April like the last time. It was very hard for [DeCosta] to build a roster when that thing is not settled.\"\"Like the last time\" is worth noting. Jackson, who does not have an agent and represents himself in contract negotiations, has stated multiple times that he wants to stay in Baltimore. But the last time the two sides worked on a contract extension, it took three years. Jackson was eligible for an extension in 2021, after his third NFL season, but the two sides didn't come to an agreement. In 2022, Bisciotti seemed to pin the lack of negotiations on Jackson.\n\"Unless he has a change of heart and calls Eric and says 'I'm ready,' Eric can't keep calling him and say, 'You really need to get in here,'\" Bisciotti said in March 2022. \"That's not a GM's job.\"In 2023, the situation reached fever pitch. The Ravens used the non-exclusive franchise tag on him, a move that allowed him to negotiate with other teams. A few days later, Jackson revealed he had requested a trade weeks prior as Baltimore wasn't \"interested  in meeting [his] value.\"Then in late April 2023, Jackson signed a five-year, $260 million extension with Baltimore.\n\n        \n            \n                Assessing past, present, future of Lamar Jackson, John Harbaugh, Ravens as contract negotiations loom\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBisciotti also said Tuesday that if the two sides couldn't agree to an extension, the team would lower Jackson's cap hit by spreading it into void years, though that's a far less desirable outcome.\"We want another window, and Lamar knows that,\" Bisciotti said. \"I think that he's amenable to doing something that mirrors the last deal he did, although the annual number will be a little higher. But I'm hoping that it's 'Plug a new number in the same contract he signed last year' and move on.\"The Ravens are coming off arguably the most disappointing season in the NFL, falling from preseason Super Bowl favorites to an 8-9 record and missing the playoffs entirely. Baltimore fired Harbaugh after 18 years and will look to reload around Jackson, 29. The two-time MVP, who missed four games due to injury, will be actively involved and have \"a lot of say\" in the hiring process, Bisciotti added.\n\n        \n            \n                What's next for the Ravens? Big questions for Lamar Jackson, John Harbaugh after disappointing 2025 season\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Bryson DeChambeau, Jon Rahm and Cameron Smith have all committed to play on LIV Golf for the 2026 season following the departure of Brooks Koepka for the PGA Tour. Talking at LIV Golf's media week in South Florida, DeChambeau noted that he is under contract for the upcoming season while Rahm and Smith stated they had no plans to go anywhere.\"I'm contracted through 2026, so excited about this year,\" DeChambeau said.\"Yeah, I'm not planning on going anywhere, so very similar answer to what Bryson gave,\" Rahm said. \"I wish Brooks the best, and as far as I'm concerned, I'm focused on LIV for this year and hoping my team can repeat as champs.\"Meanwhile, Smith told Golf Digest's Evin Priest, \"I made a decision to come here and I stand by it.\"\nOn Monday, the PGA Tour announced the creation of the Returning Member Program targeted at four members of LIV Golf -- Koepka, Rahm, DeChambeau and Smith. Under the pathway back to the PGA Tour, those players who had won a major championship or the Players Championship from 2022-25 would be allow to play on the PGA Tour in 2026. The transfer window opened Monday and will close on Feb. 2 -- two days before LIV Golf's first tournament of its 2026 season.Koepka mutually parted ways with LIV Golf on Dec. 23, 2025 citing the desire to spend more time with his family. The five-time major champion applied for his PGA Tour membership to be reinstated and utilized this newly-created mechanism to return in 2026 with his first start coming at the Farmers Insurance Open at the end of January.DeChambeau and Smith have both been with LIV Golf since the summer of 2022 while Rahm came over to the league at the onset of 2024. Since then, Rahm has collected two straight season-long individual crowns with his Legion XIII squad taking home the team title as well in 2025. Smith's Ripper GC won the team competition in 2024 while DeChambeau's Crushers raised the trophy the year prior.\nLIV Golf is moving to 72 holes for the first time in league history in the 2026 season in hopes of appeasing the Official World Golf Rankings for its players to earn points from. The league applied again recently for that purpose. Its season begins Feb. 4 when the circuit travels to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. \n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Mavericks' star Anthony Davis will be sidelined for at least six weeks as he recovers from ligament damage in his left hand, according to ESPN. Davis had been out for the past two games for Dallas, seeking multiple opinions on if surgery was needed for the injury. It's been determined that surgery will not be needed, per ESPN and he'll be reevaluated in six weeks. He sustained the injury during Dallas' 116-114 loss to the Utah Jazz last week, when his hand got caught in Lauri Markkanen's jersey while defending him under the basket.When the injury occurred, Davis immediately began grabbing at his hand in pain and came out of the game. He walked back to the locker room, but paused for a moment in the tunnel doubled over in pain.\nWhen the Mavericks traveled to Chicago to face the Bulls Jan. 10, Davis was seen in a sling with his hand heavily wrapped. Missing the next six weeks means Davis won't return until after the Feb. 5 trade deadline, but that seemingly won't stop the Mavericks from shopping him around on the trade market.\nIf Davis returns to the floor this season, he could be doing so for a different team, as ESPN reports that Dallas still plans to make him available on the trade market. Given Davis' current injured status, as well as his hefty contract and lengthy injury history, determining what team would be willing to take the risk to take him on is difficult.There was thought that the Hawks could make a run at Davis, especially after they traded Trae Young to the Wizards, which makes them able to take on the $54.1 million Davis is owed this season. That interest may have dissipated with him now out for at least a month and a half.\nIf there is a team out there who still wants Davis, the Mavericks will have to sell low on the big man. That's a consequence of trading for an oft-injured player who hasn't been able to stay on the floor long enough to rebuild his trade value. The Raptors have been linked to Davis in the past, so too have the Bulls and Warriors at one point or another. But at this point, it would be more shocking for Davis to be traded before the deadline than to see him suit up for the Mavericks again this season.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Notre Dame coach Marcus Freeman had already signaled his intention to return to South Bend in 2026 and not pursue NFL opportunities after publicly posting \"run it back\" on social media in late December. That message only temporarily slowed rumors that Freeman would consider leaving the Fighting Irish to pursue an NFL job.Those rumors kicked up again on Tuesday, shortly after Mike Tomlin stepped down as Pittsburgh Steelers coach after 19 seasons, with the announcement that Freeman would hold a press conference on Wednesday. Despite the timing of the press conference announcement, ESPN reported that Freeman is expected to remain in South Bend.Freeman agreed to a restructured contract that puts him in the \"top tier\" of compensation among college coaches after turning down interest from two NFL franchises, Sports Illustrated reported. The New York Giants were among the teams in pursuit of Freeman, CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones previously reported.Notre Dame athletic director Pete Bevacqua said throughout the process he was working on keeping Freeman in tow for the long haul, but understood why interested NFL parties had interest in one of college football's fastest-rising coaches. Freeman's been relatively quiet about NFL murmurs, only once responding to a question about potential interest from various franchises, including the Giants.\n\n        \n            \n                Marcus Freeman will not face charges after Notre Dame coach was accused of battery at wrestling event\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"Well, I think the gratitude you have for being mentioned by an organization like that. I have a lot of respect for all NFL teams, but the history of the Giants is tremendous,\" Freeman said before Christmas. \"It reminds me of the honor I have to be in the position I'm in. You wouldn't have said that statement if I didn't have this job and we weren't having success. It's a reminder for me that the people in our program, the work they put in results in an output that's successful.\"Bevacqua previously acknowledged \"everybody has eyes on Marcus\" given his 43-11 overall record as the Fighting Irish coach, which includes a national championship appearance.Bevacqua is a former executive at Creative Artists Agency (CAA) and was the chairman of NBC Sports, so he has vast experience at the negotiating table. Freeman signed a lucrative extension ahead of last season's playoff appearance and the Fighting Irish were prepared if an NFL team were to try and swoop in.\n\"I would never say we wouldn't match anything when it comes to Marcus,\" Bevacqua said. \"I make sure that he knows that he will be where he deserves to be, and that is at the top, top, top tier of college football coaches when it comes to compensation every year. I view his contract -- although a multi-year contract -- as a living, breathing document that we will revise every year as need be to make sure he's where he needs to be. He knows he has that commitment from me, and more important from the university.\"Freeman was promoted from defensive coordinator to head coach in 2021 after Brian Kelly's departure for LSU. On the heels of last season's run to the national championship, a 34-23 loss to Ohio State, Freeman led the Irish to a 10-2 record this season. After starting 0-2, Notre Dame reeled off 10 consecutive victories before being controversially kept out of the College Football Playoff. After that decision, Notre Dame decided not to play in a bowl game. Notre Dame should enter 2026 as national title contenderDespite losing running backs Jeremiyah Love and Jadarian Price, a couple of offensive line captains a few notable defenders off this season's 10-2 squad, the Fighting Irish will be on the short list of national title frontrunners next fall.\nQuarterback C.J. Carr returns for his second campaign as the starter while there's a strong nucleus of budding talent around him. A favorable slate should assist Notre Dame in getting back to the playoff for the second time in three years as well, given the Fighting Irish's memorandum of understanding signed last spring which guarantees a spot in the bracket if they rank inside the top 12 of the final rankings.Not all dates are finalized, but Notre Dame plays only three true road games -- North Carolina, Syracuse and Purdue -- and has neutral-site contests against Wisconsin and Navy.And with the transfer portal opening Jan. 2 with resources to put toward talent acquisition, Freeman should be able to fill any areas of need ahead of spring camp. Notre Dame's incoming 2026 signing class is rated as the fourth-best recruiting haul nationally, per 247Sports, and includes three five-star prospects -- edge rusher Rodney Dunham (Charlotte, N.C.), tight end Ian Premer (Great Bend, Kan.) and safety Joey O'Brien (Wyndmoor, Penn.).\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The change Philadelphia Eagles fans have been waiting for is finally here: head coach Nick Sirianni is making a change at offensive coordinator and removing Kevin Patullo from that role. Philadelphia took a significant step back offensively with Patullo as the offensive play caller in place of Kellen Moore after he departed to become the New Orleans Saints head coach following the Eagles' Super Bowl LIX triumph. Quarterback Jalen Hurts threw for under 200 yards nine times in the 2025 regular season, which was the second most such games with Carolina Panthers quarterback Bryce Young (12) having more. That's astounding considering Hurts possesses running back Saquon Barkley, wide receiver A.J. Brown, wide receiver DeVonta Smith and tight end Dallas Goedert at his disposal with a stout offensive line in front of him. Barkley averaged just 71.3 rush yards per game this season after averaging 125.3 in his 2024 NFL Offensive Player of the Year campaign in 2024. Brown had zero catches in the second half of a game five times, which is the same amount times the following top wide receivers had combined in 2025: Ja'Marr Chase (one), Justin Jefferson (one), Puka Nacua (one), Jaxon Smith-Njigba (zero), Amon-Ra St. Brown (one), CeeDee Lamb (one) and George Pickens (zero). Eagles last two seasons20242025Record14-311-6Playoff resultWon Super BowlLost wild cardPPG27.2 22.3Total YPG367.2*311.2Rush YPG179.3*116.9* Top 10 in NFL So which established offensive minds will Sirianni pursue in an effort to elevate his squad back to true Super Bowl contention? Here is a look at five potential candidates.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Mike McDaniel, former Miami Dolphins head coachMike McDaniel has already been requested to interview for multiple head-coaching vacancies, so there's a good chance he will remain an NFL head coach in 2026. However, on the off chance he doesn't get one of the NFL's nine vacancies that are currently available, he would be the most coveted offensive coordinator option. His Dolphins offenses averaged 5.78 yards per play, the seventh-best among head coaches in the Super Bowl era (since 1966), minimum 50 games as an NFL head coach.Tua Tagovailoa's connection to Tyreek Hill in McDaniel's first two seasons in Miami, 2022 to 2023, was electric. Hill produced over 1,700 yards receiving in both years, which earned him consecutive first-team All-Pro honors. Perhaps he could do the same with Hurts and Brown if he doesn't become a head coach in 2026.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Brian Daboll, former New York Giants head coachBrian Daboll knows a thing or two about building capable NFL offenses around quarterbacks who have limited passing skillsets. Daboll went to the playoffs in 2022 with then-New York Giants quarterback Daniel Jones averaging 6.5 air yards per pass attempt, which ranked 31st of 33 qualified quarterbacks that season. Barkley still produced 1,312 yards rushing and 10 rushing touchdowns on under 300 carries, 295 to be exact, that year.Daboll could certainly put together a high-flying offense after being reunited with Barkley and having Brown and Smith at his disposal. Rookie first-round quarterback Jaxson Dart looked like a dual-threat dynamo with Daboll calling the plays before his midseason firing, so there's no reason why he couldn't get Hurts looking more like he did in 2022 and 2024 when Philadelphia went to the Super Bowl. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Frank Reich, former Indianapolis Colts head coachSirianni was Frank Reich's Indianapolis Colts' offensive coordinator for three seasons from 2018 to 2020 before being hired to be the Eagles head coach in 2021. Reich was also the Eagles' offensive coordinator in 2017 for the franchise's first Super Bowl championship team. Hiring Reich would give Sirianni a trusted confidant and a coordinator who once upon a time had Carson Wentz playing like an NFL MVP candidate. Reich is also available right now after spending one season as Stanford's interim head coach for former Colts quarterback Andrew Luck, who is now the general manager of his alma mater's football program. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Kliff Kingsbury, former Washington Commanders offensive coordinatorKliff Kingsbury helped Washington Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels produce what stands statistically as the greatest rookie quarterback season in NFL history after their run to the 2024 NFC Championship game. Wide receiver Terry McLaurin caught a Washington franchise record 13 receiving touchdowns in 2024 as well. With Daniels missing 10 games because of injury in 2025, Washington took a step back, which led to Kingsbury parting ways with Washington.If Kingsbury doesn't get his second NFL head-coaching job this offseason, perhaps he could come to the Eagles where he could certainly uplift a talented Philadelphia offense. Jayden Daniels 2024 season with Kliff Kingsbury, including playoffsAll-time rookie rankWins14T-1st*Total yards5,4161stTotal TD371st* Tied with Ben Roethlisberger (2004)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Philip Rivers, former Indianapolis Colts and Los Angeles Chargers quarterbackPhilip Rivers is now done playing professional football, but that doesn't mean his time with the NFL is finished. He's been the head coach at Fairhope (Ala.) St. Michael Catholic, but after getting a taste of football at the highest level again after playing for the Colts in 2025, could he be interested in coaching in the league? If he is, Rivers coming to work with Sirianni to coach the uber-talented Eagles offense would make sense.Sirianni was Rivers' quarterbacks coach on the Chargers for the 2013 and 2024 seasons, and he was Rivers' offensive coordinator with the Colts in 2020. There's a high level of familiarity there, and there wouldn't be a much better opportunity for the eight-time Pro Bowl quarterback to begin his NFL coaching career than with an offense as loaded as the Eagles' unit is entering 2026. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        All bets appear to be off as Mike Tomlin has become the latest former NFL coach to leave his post. While many of his peers were fired since the 2025 regular season concluded, Tomlin was one of the fortunate few NFL coaches who was able to leave on his terms. That's what happened on Tuesday, mere hours after the Steelers' 2025 season came to an end after Pittsburgh lost its seventh straight playoff game under Tomlin. Tomlin and the Steelers' lack of recent playoff success somewhat overshadowed his overall body of work in Pittsburgh that included a Super Bowl win, two AFC titles, eight division titles, 13 playoff appearances and 19 straight non-losing seasons. Still just 53 years old, Tomlin will surely have his share of options regarding what he will do next. And while some potential options are more realistic than others, the recent turnover in the NFL should be a reminder to not rule anything out when it comes to Tomlin and what he might do next. \n        \n            \n                Mike Tomlin stepping away could give the Steelers the reset they need. It'll be easier said than done\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHere's a quick rundown of Tomlin's likely options as he charts out on a new path. \nCoaching in 2026 While many assumed that Pittsburgh would be his last team, Tomlin recently acknowledged on the Rich Eisen Show that he still loves coaching despite the obvious challenges that come with it. \"Hey, I'm institutionalized,\" he said. \"Man, I gotta have it. I just love the challenges week in and week out that this job provides. The growth in it, the collective growth, the individual growth. A lot of lessons that I've learned in life have been through my football experiences. I've been on the team every year of my life since 1980, and so I really appreciate it.\" In that vein, it shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone if Tomlin is back on the sidelines in 2026. And if he chooses to coach again, he will likely have his pick of several jobs that are currently open. Having the opportunity to interview for one of the league's current openings may have been one of the reasons why he chose to step down less than 24 hours after the Steelers' season ended. \nOne thing we know is that Tomlin doesn't want to spend time on a rebuild. There's a reason why the Steelers never had a losing season under his watch. He wants the opportunity to win now and every year moving forward. That means that Tomlin's next potential team would have to have a roster that is in position to win now. That could lead to the Atlanta Falcons, who are coming off two disappointing 8-9 seasons despite having several stars on their roster that includes running back Bijan Robinson, wideout Drake London, tight end Kyle Pitts, safety Jessie Bates III, and pass rushers James Pearce Jr. and Jalon Walker, among others. Quarterback remains a question in Atlanta, although the Falcons don't have a bad situation after Kirk Cousins showed major signs of his old form last year after replacing Michael Penix Jr. in the starting lineup. \nOutside of Atlanta, the Ravens would be another appealing landing spot. In Baltimore, Tomlin would have his coveted franchise quarterback in Lamar Jackson and a team that was a play away from defeating the Bills and reaching the AFC title game in 2024. While less appealing, the Browns could also be a possible landing spot for Tomlin. Unlike Atlanta and Baltimore, Tomlin would likely get a statue in Cleveland if he led the Browns to their first division title since 1989. While his consistent streak of non-losing season probably wasn't properly appreciated in Pittsburgh, it undoubtedly would in Cleveland. The Browns are coming off consecutive losing seasons, but they fielded one of the NFL's defenses last season and have an intriguing quarterback room in Shedeur Sanders and Dillon Gabriel. Those things could be selling points for Tomlin, who also wouldn't have to move very far if he ended up in Cleveland. \nThere's a major roadblock, though, which would likely prevent Tomlin from ending up in either Baltimore or Cleveland. That's the fact that the Steelers still own his rights, which means that Pittsburgh would have to approve and then receive compensation should a team try to land Tomlin, which leads us to our next scenario. A jump to media Similar to coaching, there's a belief that Tomlin would have his pick of several media jobs should he chose to go that route. While it probably wouldn't be as gratifying as coaching, a job in the media would allow Tomlin to stay close to the game while working significantly less hours and giving him the chance to showcase his impressive communication skills. Tomlin-isms have become the stuff of legend in Pittsburgh. His weekly Tuesday press conferences typically included some of his patented sayings (my personal favorite was \"When you have red paint, you paint your barn red\") that were often as humurous as they were insightful. \nIt might help that Tomlin's mentor, Tony Dungy, has enjoyed an extremely successful career in broadcasting since he left coaching nearly 20 years ago. Tomlin's predecessor, Bill Cowher, has also enjoyed a highly-successful career in broadcasting that has actually lasted longer than his time as the Steelers coach. From a legacy standpoint, there's no doubt that Dungy and Cowher's relevancy as broadcasters helped both receive induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. It would likely do the same for Tomlin, whose career in Pittsburgh largely mimicked the success that Dungy and Cowher had as coaches. A year offIn my opinion, this is the most unlikely scenario. For someone whose boundless energy became the stuff of legend in Pittsburgh, it's far-fetched to imagine Tomlin stashing that energy away for a year in lieu of some down time. \nThat being said, it is definitely possible that Tomlin takes a year to himself before making his next move. Coaching in the NFL is a grind, after all, and Tomlin might be ready for a well-deserved break. A year off would given Tomlin more time with his wife and three adult children. It would also give him some time to enjoy what he was able to accomplish in Pittsburgh before he delves into his next challenge. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        For just the fourth time since 1969, the Pittsburgh Steelers must look for a new coach. Longtime coach Mike Tomlin has decided to step down from his post in Pittsburgh, signaling the end of a 19-year run in Pittsburgh as the longest tenured coach in the league.In 2024, Steelers president Art Rooney II extended Tomlin's contract while exuding confidence that Tomlin would get the franchise back to winning playoff games. Since that extension, the Steelers have lost two more playoff games while extending their drought without a playoff win to nine seasons. \"During our meeting today, coach Tomlin informed me that he has decided to step down as our head coach,\" Rooney said in a statement. \"Obviously, I am extremely grateful to Mike for all the hard work, dedication and success we shared over the last 19 years. It is hard for me to put into words the level of respect and appreciate I have for coach Tomlin. He guided the franchise to our sixth Super Bowl championship and made the playoffs 13 times during his tenure, including winning the AFC North eight times in his career. His track record of never having a losing season in 19 years will likely never be duplicated. \"My family and I, and everyone connected to Steelers management, are forever grateful for the passion and dedication Mike Tomlin has devoted to Steelers football.\"\nTomlin, 53, served as the Steelers' coach from 2007-25. He won a Super Bowl during his second season (becoming the youngest head coach to do so at the time), guided the Steelers to another Super Bowl appearance during his fourth season. Tomlin then made NFL history by becoming the first coach to begin his career with 19 consecutive non-losing seasons. \"This organization has bene a huge part of my life for many years, and it has been an absolute honor to lead this team,\" Tomlin said in a statement. \"I am deeply grateful to Art Rooney II and the late Ambassador Rooney for their trust and support. I am also thankful to the players who gave everything they had every day, and to the coaches and staff whose commitment and dedication made this journey so meaningful.\"While this chapter comes to a close, my respect and love for the Pittsburgh Steelers will never change. I am excited for what the future holds for this organization, and I will forever be grateful for my time coaching in Pittsburgh.\" \nThis past season, Tomlin tied former Steelers Hall of Fame coach Chuck Noll with 193 regular season wins, the ninth-highest total in league history. Including the postseason, Tomlin won 201 games during his nearly two-decade long run with the Steelers. He also led the Steelers to their eighth AFC North division titles that included this past season after Pittsburgh went 10-7.Tomlin's ability to consistently churn out competitive teams is unrivaled, but his teams have struggled of late in the postseason. After winning five of his first six playoff games, Tomlin went just 3-11 in his final 14 playoff games in Pittsburgh. He joined Bengals coach Marvin Lewis as the only two coaches in history to lose seven consecutive postseason games after the Steelers lost to the Texans in this year's AFC wild card round. Pittsburgh was largely outplayed in each of those losses. Of those seven losses, six were of double-digit variety. In the one outlier (a 45-42 loss to the Jaguars in the 2017 divisional round), the Steelers trailed 28-7 before mounting an unsuccessful rally that included a touchdown with one second remaining that made the final score closer than the game actually was. \nLack of stability at the quarterback position was one of Pittsburgh's major issues during Tomlin's final seasons with the team. Following Ben Roethlisberger's retirement at the end of the 2021 season, the Steelers had six different starting quarterbacks. And while each one had pockets of success, they were unable to take the Steelers to the next level in terms of winning a playoff game and making a serious run at a Super Bowl. As noted above, the Steelers have had just three head coaches since 1969: Noll, Tomlin and Bill Cowher, whose 15 years in Pittsburgh resulted in a Hall of Fame induction in 2021. Tomlin will likely join his predecessors in Canton, Ohio sometime down the road. As far as the Steelers' next coach, the Steelers have historically hired first-time coaches who had had success as assistant coaches while working alongside some of the best head coaches. Noll served on Don Shula's staff before getting the Steelers' job, and Cowher was mentored by Marty Schottenheimer (who is eighth on the all-time wins list) before he came to Pittsburgh in 1992. \nTomlin was a position coach under both Tony Dungy and Jon Gruden and won a Super Bowl as a member of the 2002 Buccaneers' coaching staff. He then had a successful stint as the Vikings' defensive coordinator before being hired by then-Steelers owner Dan Rooney in 2007. Whoever is the Steelers' next coach will not only have the tall task in following in those coaches' footsteps, he will also be charged with snapping the franchise's drought without a playoff win, which dates back to the 2016 season. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Through the first three quarters on Sunday night, Anthony Edwards missed 10 of 16 shots and all four of his 3-pointers. The Wolves trailed the Spurs by as many as 19. Good players have bad nights, but great players are able to flip those bad nights in an instant. Edwards is a great player, and he relishes the responsibility of carrying the late-game load regardless of how things have gone to that point. \"I don't care what happens in the first three quarters,\" Edwards said on Sunday. \"...I feel like my teammates know, in the last four minutes of the fourth quarter, we giving the ball to [No.] 5.\" Indeed, Edwards got the ball in crunch time on Sunday and knew just what to do with it, hitting four of his five fourth-quarter shots including this sick fadeaway to give Minnesota its first lead of the game with 2:19 to play. \nA couple minutes later, Edwards put Victor Wembanyama into his bag, shook him up, and kissed in what proved to be the game-winner with 24 seconds to play. \n\"A few years ago, he probably shoots a step-back 3 over Wemby,\" Rudy Gobert said of Edwards' game-winner. \"He can make [the step-back], but it's not a super high percentage shot. Tonight, he was patient and poised.\"For a guy who can make any shot on the floor, deciding which one to take, and when to take it, can be a surprisingly difficult task. There's no wrong choice, necessarily. But there are better choices. This season, Edwards is making the better choices -- and when a player who possesses all the shot-making ability the basketball gods could possibly put into one body starts actually taking the right shots, results are going to follow. Following Sunday's performance, Edwards is shooting a remarkable 70.7% (57% from 3) of his shots in the \"clutch\" -- defined as any possession inside the final five minutes when the score is within five points. Nobody else who has taken at least 15 clutch shots is even close to those marks, and they are a huge jump from Ant's 37.5/29.9 combined clutch shooting splits over the previous three seasons. \n\"I think [earlier in his career], his decision-making at the end of games was a little too much hero ball, to be honest,\" Gobert said. \"I feel like he [now] values the ball more. He understands these possessions are really important.\"CLUTCH ANTTS%EFG%NET RATINGTOTAL +/-2024-2558.051.7-9.9-512025-2682.180.5+9.4+21This started on opening night. The Wolves, who are 11-7 in clutch games so far after going 20-25 last year, were trailing Portland with just over a minute to play when Ant dropped Jerami Grant on a step-back 3. On Christmas, the Wolves trailed the Nuggets by 15 halfway through the fourth quarter only for Edwards to score 11 points over the final five minutes including this fadeaway corner 3 to send the game to overtime. How about down two with inside a minute to play against the defending champs?\nThese are the types of shots that Inpredictable tracks as part of its Clutch Win Probability Added metric, in which Edwards ranks seventh league-wide and No. 1 overall based solely on made and missed field goals. By Inpredictable's count, Edwards has attempted 41 shots this season that have had an \"elevated impact on win probability,\" and on those shots he has posted a staggering 75.6 eFG%. You don't chart that kind of number just taking the highlight shots you just watched. To Gobert's earlier point, Edwards is recognizing how, and by whom, he's being guarded in crunch time, and when given a choice between contested jumpers and attacking -- as he did on Wemby -- when he has the advantage, he's more open to the latter. Here he is tying the game in the closing seconds against New Orleans:And here again with the Wolves down two in the final minute of overtime on Christmas:Only seven players have scored more clutch points in the paint than Edwards' 31 this season, and all of them have played in more clutch games. That's a testament to an all-around attack on the most pivotal possessions, when, as we've all seen far too many times, it is so easy even for the most gifted scorers to concede their inherent creative advantages and fire up 20-footers by default. Edwards doesn't play that game anymore. He plays his game. And he doesn't deviate in the clutch. If the jumper is the shot, he takes it. If the lane is open or he has the mismatch, he attacks it. It has been said of clutch hitters in baseball that they don't necessarily get better when the stakes are highest, they just don't get worse. In other words, they stay the same player regardless of circumstance. That's Edwards in now his sixth NBA season. He's had all the talent in the world from Day 1, but every year he has sharpened. He went from an inefficient shooter to leading league with 320 made 3-pointers a season ago at almost 40%. This year he's at 41% from deep with a career-high 62.6 true-shooting clip. If you double him now, he understands the power of getting off the ball and letting someone else tally both the bucket and the assist. Beyond the scoring and highlight dunks, these are all required steps in the pursuit of true superstardom. The one frontier Edwards had left to conquer was the clutch, and this season, at least so far, he's doing that. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        After 19 seasons in Pittsburgh, Mike Tomlin decided to step down as head coach of the Steelers on Tuesday. That means the NFL's two longest-tenured head coaches going into the 2025 season -- Tomlin and John Harbaugh -- are now both out of a job. The NFL is a cutthroat league where no one lasts forever and the past seven days have been proof of that. Harbaugh was fired by the Ravens less than 48 hours after losing to Tomlin's Steelers in a wild Week 18 game that kept Baltimore out of the playoffs. As for Tomlin, he decided to step down just one day after losing his seventh playoff game in a row, which ties him with former Bengals coach Marvin Lewis for the most consecutive postseason losses in NFL history. With Tomlin out of a job, that means there is only one head coach in the NFL who's been with the same team for at least 10 seasons: Andy Reid. Let's take a look at the five longest-tenured coaches in the NFL along with the year they were hired: \n1. Chiefs coach Andy Reid (2013) T-2. Bills coach Sean McDermott (2017) T-2. Rams coach Sean McVay (2017) T-2. 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan (2017) T-5. Bengals coach Zac Taylor (2019)T-5. Packers coach Matt LaFleur (2019)This list really shows you how fleeting a career can be for an NFL head coach. There's only one coach on this list who hasn't really hasn't been mentioned as a possible hot seat candidate over the past 12 months and that's McVay. Reid led the the Chiefs to the Super Bowl in five out of six seasons from 2019 through 2024, but even some fans were calling for his head after Kansas City finished 6-11 this year. \nDespite the fan unhappiness, Reid's job seems pretty safe. In Buffalo, McDermott has the Bills in the divisional round of the playoffs for the sixth straight year, which is the longest active streak in the NFL, but he still hasn't been able to reach the promised land with Josh Allen, which has rankled some fans. According to ESPN, there's been some speculation around the league that McDermott could actually be on the hot seat if the Bills don't \"make a playoff run\" this year. If the Bills lose on Saturday in Denver, things could certainly get interesting. \n        \n            \n                Eight Steelers coaching candidates to watch after Mike Tomlin steps down\n                \n                    Bryan DeArdo                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nFor the 49ers, there was some talk that Shanahan was on the hot seat after a 2024 season where his team finished just 6-11, but John Lynch shot down that chatter during an interview near the end of the 2024 season. \"I've found the whole discussion on Kyle rather comical,\" Lynch said, via NFL.com. \"We have won four of the last five division championships. We've been to two Super Bowls. The standard here is to win championships, and we've fallen short of that, I understand. But we have an excellent head coach, and the fact that people are talking about stuff like that, I do find it comical.\"\nThe 49ers stuck with Shanahan for 2025 and the decision paid off, because he's pulled off one of the most impressive coaching jobs of the season. Despite losing multiple key players to injury, Shanahan has led the 49ers to the divisional round of the playoffs. And then there's Zac Taylor, who is officially the last man standing in the AFC North with the Browns, Ravens and Steelers all getting rid of their coaches. Although the Bengals have missed the playoffs for three straight years, Taylor got a vote of confidence from owner Mike Brown in early January. \"Our focus is on building a team that can consistently compete at the highest level, with the goal of winning championships,\" Brown said in a statement on Jan. 5. \"After thoughtful consideration, I am confident that Duke Tobin and Zac Taylor are the right leaders to guide us forward. They have proven they can build and lead teams that compete for championships.\"\nTaylor might be safe now, but the pressure will certainly be on him in 2026. If he can't make the playoffs with Joe Burrow in a division that will have three new head coaches, then it will likely be time for the Bengals to cut ties with him. In Green Bay, Matt LaFleur has a contract that expires at the end of the 2026 season. The Packers are expected to try to work out a contract extension with LaFleur, but until that gets done, it's impossible to say for sure what might happen there. LaFleur has been extremely successful in the regular season, but that hasn't translated to playoff success. He has just a 3-6 career record in the playoffs, including Saturday's shocking 31-27 loss to the Bears where the Packers blew an 18-point lead. The bottom line here is that if you don't produce in the NFL, you won't last long, and even if you do produce, you won't last long it you're not producing playoff wins or Lombardi Trophies. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Anyone looking for signs of Chelsea's era under new management would have been left wanting on Saturday night. The scoreline might have been more impressive than most in the dog days of Enzo Maresca's tenure, a 5-1 win at Charlton Athletic of the Championship, but this was still a team that hoarded possession and that was prepared to be patient in its pursuit of high quality chances.As Liam Rosenior explained after the game, he had doing \"nothing tactical, nothing technical\" with his new squad. The former Strasbourg manager believes he has inherited a \"good team\" that has been \"well-coached.\" This is not a club intent on reinventing the wheel.New manager, same Chelsea  Chelsea are not changing. No wonder. Those who can deliver the most profound impact on Chelsea's squad, their fitness, the tone of the club, arguably even the playing style are all in situ.There are at least five directors at Chelsea whose impact on the first team might be said to eclipse Rosenior's. Co-sporting directors Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley might have drawn the ire of supporters but CBS Sports sources suggest there is no evidence that those frustrations are shared by their employers. The most recent appointment, Dave Fallows, leads areas that include \"scouting and data, loans and player pathways.\" As with Winstanley and Stewart he is contracted until 2031.\nJoe Shields was appointed in 2022 as \"co-director of recruitment and talent\". Two years later Sam Jewell came from Brighton becoming the sporting director for global recruiting. This quintet were established as the sporting leadership team in November. Conspicuous in their absence from that list of power brokers was the first team head coach.That group is to say nothing for Behdad Eghbali, who has certainly taken a hands on approach to this particular slice of the Clearlake Capital portfolio. It is something of a ritual for Stamford Bridge regulars to see him walking across the field in the direction of the dressing room.A head coach with limited powerInto this fray, Rosenior will function as a voice among many. It would be wrong to suggest that Maresca was not consulted on Chelsea's transfer business but he did not have the deciding vote that it seemed was what he wanted. Take the near-season ending injury suffered by Levi Colwill in the summer. Maresca made no secret of his desire to supplement his squad with an experienced alternative and, according to CBS Sports sources, that was a market that was explored by the club. However, there was a high bar to be set for any possible replacement, particularly when the silver lining to the injury was the space opened up for Josh Acheampong to play more frequently.\nCome the summer, Rosenior will be able to offer input into whatever business Chelsea might conduct, but it will be input, not an overbearing voice. He should probably expect a fair bit of that business. After all, the most recent set of accounts show an annual amortization charge of around $250 million, the highest in the Premier League. A space will have to be found in the squad for Geovany Quenda, due to arrive from Sporting CP, while strikers Dastan Satpayev and Emmanuel Emegha are also signed up for the summer.Todd Boehly has previously spoken of Chelsea having \"a portfolio of players that are going to be consistent and reliable and have the potential to be together for a very long time.\" It now seems more likely that that will be the core of Rosenior's squad, the likes of Cole Palmer, Moises Caicedo and perhaps soon Estevao. Around them, expect the parts to be more interchangeable. In a matter of months Nicolas Jackson could go from Maresca's \"perfect number nine\" to a player Chelsea were eager to move on.If recruitment was one of the flashpoints between Maresca and his employers, though not specifically in the case of Jackson, the involvement of the medical department was another. Indeed it was said to be the intervention of that particular group that prompted the comments about the \"worst 48 hours\" that would set in motion events that ended in the Italian's sacking.\nThere is said to be a level of autonomy to the medical department that Maresca brushed up against. Then again, whatever Chelsea have been doing has worked well. Last season, when they did have the benefit of being able to win the Conference League with what often amounted to a shadow squad, they lost significantly fewer minutes than the likes of Arsenal, Manchester City and Tottenham to injuries. Club captain Reece James has been fit for an entire year.The input, let alone perceived interference, of sports scientists and physios in the decisions of head coaches and managers may seem like anathema to many in the English game but it is also an inevitable reality of an age of ever more football played at ever more intensity. If reports of clashing between Maresca and his medical team are indeed the case, Chelsea may be ahead of the curve in regards to the power of the latter. Sources within the game, however, expect others to follow.An American vision for an English soccer teamAnd while it might seem strange on English shores for head coaches to be overruled in questions of squad building and load management, it is perfectly normal State-side. Boehly, for instance, got the silverware bug at the Los Angeles Dodgers. Few who follow them more closely than this column would argue that Dave Roberts' voice holds the greatest sway at Dodgers Stadium.\nCertainly the broader march of the sport is in the same direction as Chelsea. There are ever-fewer elite coaches empowered with the authority that Rosenior's opponent on Wednesday night have. Mikel Arteta found an Arsenal bereft of purpose and imbued it with identity. The club hierarchy went to their-then head coach and asked him to be their manager. It seemed that Maresca had similarly lofty ambitions and that Chelsea's response was to invite him to explore those reported links with Manchester City and Juventus at his own leisure.Now if all of the above makes it seem like Rosenior will have nothing to do, that he is an inessential part of a broader operation, that would not be true. For starters, Rosenior must function as the public face of the Chelsea organisation. That will certainly be a challenge at a time when supporters are protesting against ownership vehicle BlueCo. So far he seems to have settled into that aspect of the role, publicly celebrating the \"limitless\" potential of the young squad he has inherited. Equally, he seems intent on carving out space for himself to operate within the sizeable org chart.\"I will make the decisions at this football club, that is why I have been brought in,\" he said in his introductory press conference. \"I understand, I am not an alien. I know what is being said. But there is no way you can be successful as a manager if you don't make the decisions for yourself.\"\nRosenior himself has set the expectation that he will not be reinventing the tactical wheel, but there was a notable upswing in the number of sequences with nine or more passes and a clear commitment to stretch the opposition with high, wide wingers. How much of this was a function of playing a struggling second tier opponent won't be clear for some time yet.There should however be time for Rosenior to show what he really envisions Chelsea being. He had a chance to prove his worth to BlueCo at the Strasbourg helm, following last season's seventh placed finish by guiding them to the same spot in the Ligue 1 standings again. Long term contracts might be the norm at Stamford Bridge but a deal through to 2032 is still a serious commitment. No manager has made it to year six at Chelsea since Dave Sexton, whose reign between 1967 and 1974 encompassed an FA Cup and a Cup Winners' Cup. Like so many of his counterparts under previous owner Roman Abramovich, Maresca might have proven that silverware is no guarantor of job security. It is still, however, the best route to fulfilling that lengthy contract.\"I'd love to be here for six years or longer,\" Rosenior said on Monday. \"I'd be here as long as possible but I'm aware in order for that to happen, I need to win. It's as simple as that. \n\"I understand every club has a different project. This word 'project' comes out a lot now in football. But the idea in any project is that every game you play, you're trying to win it. It's as simple as that. So for me, my focus is, yes, I've got ideas about what I want the team to look like in a year's time, two years, three years' time, but I think I've got enough resources and enough tools with me now to win. I've made that clear to the players.\"In that sense, while there might be new layers and different stakeholders to consider, Rosenior's job is not really all that different from any Chelsea head coach's over the last two decades. Where once it was Abramovich bequeathing the latest superstar, now it is the many cooks of the recruitment department trying to establish the ideal recipe. What will be asked of Rosenior is the same as was asked of Maresca, Thomas Tuchel or Jose Mourinho. Win an awful lot of football matches.\n            ",

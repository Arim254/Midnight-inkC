    "body": "\n        New Year's Day has traditionally been one of the biggest days in college football, and it's no different during the College Football Playoff era, with a trio of quarterfinal games on Thursday's slate. The January 1 CFP schedule begins with No. 5 Oregon vs. No. 4 Texas Tech in the Orange Bowl at noon ET, followed by No. 9 Alabama vs. No. 1 Indiana in the Rose Bowl at 4 p.m. ET, and finally No. 6 Ole Miss vs. No. 3 Georgia in the Sugar Bowl at 8 p.m. ET.The SportsLine projection model and SportsLine's team of experts have you covered on the incredible CFP slate. The model is backing a pair of underdogs later in the day, projecting Alabama to cover as 7-point underdogs and Ole Miss to cover as 6.5-point underdogs in its College Football Playoff best bets. SportsLine expert Chip Patterson is backing Oregon to cover as 2.5-point favorites for Thursday's college football best bets. Before locking in your college football picks, be sure to check out the top college football betting picks from SportsLine's advanced computer model and team of college football experts. New users can also target the all-new DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if their first $5 wager wins:The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times, and it is 31-19 on its top-rated college football money-line picks since the beginning of the 2024 season. College Football Playoff quarterfinal best bets for New Year's Day (odds subject to change): Oregon (-2.5) vs. Texas TechAlabama (+7) vs. IndianaOle Miss (+6.5) vs. GeorgiaCombining the model's three picks into a Thursday College Football Playoff parlay would result in a payout of +567 (risk $100 to win $567). Bet it now at BetMGM: Oregon (-2.5) vs. Texas Tech\"This game sets up to be a chess match throughout the afternoon, with both Oregon and Texas Tech looking to set up and eventually execute explosive plays against elite defenses,\" SportsLine expert Chip Patterson said. \"It's a chess match that will be fascinating to watch play out and likely set up a close game deep into the second half. It's just at some point, we're going to need a quarterback to make a game-saving or game-winning play, and right now, I'd rather side with Dante Moore in that discussion. He's made some huge throws late in games this season, and I like his odds more to be able to do so again.\" Back Oregon at DraftKings, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Alabama (+7) vs. Indiana Indiana defeating Ohio State in the Big Ten championship game left no doubt that the Hoosiers are capable of winning a national championship. However, defeating Alabama by more than a touchdown is a tough task for any program. Alabama had a shocking opening-week loss to Florida State, but has since won 11 of 13 games, and its only loss by more than a touchdown came in a 28-7 final against Georgia in the SEC championship game. Indiana is 13-0 in a historic season, and the deserved favorite led by Heisman Trophy winner and possible No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft in quarterback Fernando Mendoza. However, Alabama quarterback Ty Simpson is sixth in the nation with 3,500 passing yards, and the model views seven points just too many to give a program like Alabama. The model projects the Crimson Tide to cover in 63% of simulations. Back Alabama at Caesars, where new users get their first bet matched up to $250 in bonus bets:Ole Miss (+6.5) vs. GeorgiaGeorgia needed a furious fourth-quarter comeback to defeat Ole Miss despite being the home team in their regular-season matchup this year. Ole Miss led, 35-26, in Athens entering the fourth quarter before Georgia scored the game's final 17 points to win, 43-35. Although that means Georgia over this number, that was at home, and on Thursday, they'll meet at a neutral site. Ole Miss will be without head coach Lane Kiffin, who is now with LSU, but many of the assistants from their regular-season meeting will be on the sideline. Ole Miss went 12-1 this season and had no issue in a 41-10 win over Tulane in the first round of the College Football Playoff. The model projects Ole Miss to cover in 57% of simulations.

    "body": "\n        There is no guarantee that Aaron Rodgers will suit up for the 2026 NFL season. His contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers is up at the end of the present campaign, and given his increasing age and that his production has tailed off in the latter stages of his career, retirement may be on the table this offseason. But if Rodgers does desire to play another year, he said he thinks he will have a couple of options.The path of least resistance would be to re-sign with the Steelers. That would hinge on Pittsburgh being content with fielding a 43-year-old rather than seeking a younger, potential franchise quarterback. It would also be a change of plans of sorts, as Rodgers said last offseason that the reason he and the Steelers agreed to a one-year deal was because he was \"pretty sure\" this would be his final season in the NFL.\"I'm thinking about this week, but obviously I'm 42-years-old and I'm on a one-year deal, so you know what the situation is,\" Rodgers said on Wednesday. \"Whenever this season ends, I'll be a free agent. That would give me a lot of options if I still want to play. Not a lot of options, but options. I would think maybe one or two if I decide I still want to play.\"How many teams would be interested in bringing Rodgers aboard as a starter in 2026 is a grand uncertainty. He could serve as a bridge and a mentor to a younger quarterback, but asking for anything beyond that is putting a lot of faith in the future Hall of Famer returning to his old elite form.Rodgers is in danger of logging the lowest QBR of his career this season, and the last three years have been his least efficient to date.\nPerhaps joining a more refined roster would help Rodgers rekindle some of his old magic, though. He did not exactly have the most prolific supporting casts over his lone full season with the New York Jets and 2025 run with the Steelers.Rodgers is on pace to record his fewest passing yards over a 16- or 17-game season, and by a significant margin. A loss in Week 18 would eliminate him and the Steelers from playoff contention. But while his first and potentially lone season in Pittsburgh has been far from his best, Rodgers said it has been a worthwhile campaign.\"I've enjoyed this experience,\" Rodgers said. \"Everybody in Pittsburgh has been fantastic to me on and off the field. It's really what I was hoping for from this experience. It's been even better than what I was hoping.\"\nRegardless of when he hangs up his cleats, Rodgers previously said he wishes to finish his career with the Green Bay Packers. Whether that means spending a full season with the franchise that drafted him or inking a ceremonial contract remains to be seen.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Historically, it's hard to find a more stark contract in the College Football Playoff quarterfinals than you'll see in the Rose Bowl quarterfinal. No. 9 Alabama has a strong argument as the most successful college football program of all time, ranking high in all-time wins, national titles, Heisman winners, bowl wins and conference titles. On the other side, you have Indiana, outside the top 100 in all-time wins and fresh off its first outright conference title since 1945. Alabama is coming off a dramatic first-round CFP win against Oklahoma. The Crimson Tide trailed by 17 points in the first half before rallying for a 34-24 victory, becoming the first team to win a road game in the 12-team CFP format.Indiana is making its second consecutive CFP appearance and will play in the quarterfinals for the first time in program history. The Hoosiers lost to Notre Dame in the first round last season but went 13-0 this year and defeated Ohio State in the Big Ten championship game to earn the Rose Bowl berth.Here is everything you need to know ahead of the Rose Bowl.Where to watch Alabama vs. Indiana liveDate: Thursday, Jan. 1 | Time: 4 p.m. ETLocation: Rose Bowl -- Pasadena, Calif.TV: ABC | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)\nAlabama vs. Indiana: Players to watch in Rose BowlTy Simpson, QB, Alabama: Simpson is coming off one of his strongest performances in weeks after leading Alabama to a dramatic win over Oklahoma. He completed 19 of 29 passes for 232 yards and two touchdowns as the Crimson Tide erased a 17-point first-half deficit. Simpson enters the Rose Bowl having thrown for 3,500 yards and 28 touchdowns against five interceptions. For Alabama to pull the upset, the offense will need him at his best.Ryan Williams, WR, Alabama: Williams has been one of the more puzzling players in college football this season. After a standout freshman campaign, his production has been inconsistent. He has recorded two receptions or fewer in each of his past four games, including a one-catch, five-yard outing against Oklahoma. The Rose Bowl would be an ideal stage for Williams to rediscover his big-play form.Bray Hubbard, DB, Alabama: Hubbard has been one of Alabama's most reliable defenders this season. He finished with five tackles against Oklahoma in the CFP first round. On the year, Hubbard has totaled 66 tackles (40 solo), three forced fumbles and four interceptions. Alabama's defense will be under the spotlight against Indiana's potent offense.\nFernando Mendoza, QB, Indiana: Mendoza transferred from Cal this offseason and immediately elevated Indiana's offense. In 13 games, he completed 71.5% of his passes for 2,980 yards, 33 touchdowns and six interceptions. Known for his accuracy, Mendoza threw for 222 yards and a touchdown against Ohio State in the Big Ten championship game, a performance that effectively sealed the Heisman Trophy.Omar Cooper Jr., WR, Indiana: Indiana features multiple receivers capable of stretching the field, and Cooper has been the most productive. He leads the team with 58 receptions and 804 receiving yards and finished second with 11 touchdown catches, trailing only Elijah Sarratt.Rolijah Hardy, LB, Indiana: Indiana ranked second nationally in total yards allowed and points per game, and Hardy has been a central figure in that success. He leads the Hoosiers with 87 tackles and eight sacks and has added four pass breakups this season.\nAlabama vs. Oklahoma prediction, pick\nLast year, the Rose Bowl produced one of the biggest shockers of the entire football season. No. 1 seed Oregon was stunned by Ohio State after finishing the regular season with a perfect record. Not saying that will happen, but I expect this game to be competitive. Alabama coach Kalen DeBoer has proven he can lead his respective teams to wins over ranked opponents. Indiana wins, but this will be a one-score game throughout. Pick: Alabama +6.5 (-102) \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The College Football Playoff quarterfinals open on New Year's Eve with what should be among the most tantalizing defensive battles of the entire postseason. No. 2 Ohio State and No. 10 Miami are in for a showdown in the Cotton Bowl that promises to be physical, low-scoring and high on elite talent at the point of attack.The Hurricanes already put on display this month their ability to win a game with such a formula. Their 10-3 win over No. 7 Texas A&M in the first round featured the only scoreless first half in CFP history and was a masterclass in dominance on the defensive front. Ohio State followed the same blueprint in the regular season to secure the No. 2 seed and a first-round bye, which gave the Buckeyes time to recharge in their hunt for a second straight national championship.A spot in the semifinals against either No. 3 Georgia or No. 6 Ole Miss is on the line.Follow along with live updates and analysis as Ohio State takes on Miami in the 2025 Cotton Bowl. \nWhere to watch Ohio State vs. Miami liveDate: Wednesday, Dec. 31 | Time: 7:30 p.m. ETLocation: AT&T Stadium -- Arlington, TexasTV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)Ohio State vs. Miami: Players to watchJeremiah Smith, WR, Ohio State: If Miami has any chance of pulling off the upset, it has to contain Ohio State's elite stable with wide receivers, which starts with Jeremiah Smith. Many have tried, but few have even come close to stopping the sixth-place finisher in Heisman Trophy voting. Smith is the Big Ten leader with 80 catches and crossed the 1,000-yard threshold for the second time in as many years to open his career. He will be the most talented player on the field in the Cotton Bowl.Julian Sayin, QB, Ohio State: If the campaign ended today, Sayin would hold the NCAA single-season completion percentage record with his sparkling 78.4% mark. His debut as the Ohio State quarterback in 2025 has been nothing short of tremendous. Sayin benefits greatly from the best receiving corps in college football, but he is a premier talent in his own right and proved in the regular season that he can and will make every throw asked of him.\nCaleb Downs, S, Ohio State: The Buckeyes feature five All-Americans on their defense. Caleb Downs is the most highly regarded of the bunch and even finished ninth in Heisman Trophy voting. The nation's top safety covers the entire field with ease and, boasting an impeccable football IQ, is a leader in more ways than one for a defense that is statistically among the stingiest groups in modern college football history.Malachi Toney, WR, Miami: Miami may have to go punch-for-punch with Ohio State through the air in order to hang with the Buckeyes, and it might just be capable of doing so because of Malachi Toney. The most electrifying freshman in the country racked up 89 catches for 992 yards and an ACC-best eight touchdowns through his first 13 games. That does not even cover what he does on the ground and on special teams as a special all-around contributor.Rueben Bain Jr., DL, Miami: All-American pass rusher Rueben Bain Jr. enjoyed the best game of his career with three sacks in the first-round matchup with Texas A&M. He was integral in the Hurricanes' defensive masterclass, in which it limited the Aggies to just three points. And that performance came as no surprise given his multi-year track record as an unstoppable force on a formidable defensive front.\nCarson Beck, QB, Miami: Carson Beck is quietly playing his best football of the season at the perfect time. While his 10 interceptions are the most among ACC quarterbacks, he threw just one in his last five games and completed no fewer than 70% of his passes in any of those contests. Beck's bounce-back year is a transfer portal success story that reconstructed his NFL Draft stock and may not be done just yet.Ohio State vs. Miami prediction, pick\nOhio State has not allowed more than 16 points in a game all season. Miami has not surrendered more than 24 points in regulation. It would take an outlier performance from one or both teams for the over of 42.5 to hit. A look at how these teams have fared against elite competition reinforces that point. Miami is coming off a 10-3 win over a playoff team, and one of Ohio State's games against top-15 opponents was the only instance in which more than 36 total points were scored. The numbers back up what is evident on film: these are two dominant defenses built to thrive on the biggest stage. Pick: Under 42.5\n            ",

    "body": "\n        For the third time this year, the College Football Playoff will feature a regular-season rematch when SEC foes No. 6 Ole Miss and No. 3 Georgia face off in the Sugar Bowl quarterfinal. The Rebels controlled the first meeting between these two for three quarters in Athens, but watched as Georgia ripped off 17 unanswered points in the fourth quarter to escape with a 43-35 victory. Both teams are undefeated since that game, but that fourth-quarter comeback from Georgia seemed to pull out another level from the Bulldogs that they've shown in a dominant second half of the season. Ole Miss, meanwhile, has famously gone through a tumultuous last month, with Lane Kiffin leaving for LSU hanging over the team for weeks. Despite all of the drama surrounding Kiffin's departure, the Rebels looked like a focused team that hadn't lost a step in their first-round matchup with Tulane, dismantling the Green Wave for a second time this season in a 41-10 victory. Now they'll have their sights set on avenging their lone loss of the season in the Sugar Bowl against a Georgia team that finished the season in elite form, but will be having to get going again after a four-week layoff. \nWill we see a refreshed, well-rested Georgia team or a Bulldogs team trying to shake off rust? Will Ole Miss exact revenge or was that first meeting the best they could muster against this Georgia team? We dive into a fascinating Sugar Bowl matchup below. Where to watch Georgia vs. Ole Miss liveDate: Thursday, Jan. 1 | Time: 8 p.m. ETLocation: Caesars Superdome -- New Orleans, LouisianaTV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)Georgia vs. Ole Miss: Players to watch in Sugar BowlTrinidad Chambliss, QB, Ole Miss: The first meeting between Ole Miss and Georgia was a shootout with 78 combined points. Chambliss played a huge role in that, throwing for 263 yards and one touchdown, while adding 42 yards and a pair of TDs on the ground. He was lights-out for the first three quarters, but struggled in the fourth quarter going 1-for-10 passing as Georgia came back to win. That fourth quarter was the catalyst for this Georgia defense's second-half improvement, and Chambliss will have to find a way to produce for all 60 minutes in this one for Ole Miss to have a chance. All season, Chambliss has found ways to rise to the occasion, and his emergence in taking over as the starter in Week 3 saw this Ole Miss team go from good to great. He may have to find a way to level up again this week if the Rebels are to make it to the semifinals, but nothing he's done this year suggests he won't be ready for this stage. \nGunner Stockton, QB, Georgia: Stockton had perhaps his best game of the season against the Rebels the first go around, completing 26 of 31 passes for 289 yards and four touchdowns. It was a sensational performance and indicative of how he seems capable of giving the Bulldogs exactly what they need in any given situation. Stockton isn't a draft darling and may not have a professional future, but there's an argument to be made that he's Kirby Smart's ideal quarterback. Georgia wants to run the football, control the tempo and grind teams to dust with a physical attack on both sides of the ball, which Stockton helps as a solid runner and accurate short-throw passer. However, what's made this particular Georgia team so good this year is Stockton's ability to raise his level as a passer when the Bulldogs have been forced to shift to Plan B. Against Tennessee and Ole Miss, Stockton proved he can sling it downfield when Georgia needs it, throwing for a combined 591 yards and six touchdowns in those games, with an average yards per attempt of 9.5 -- compared to a season average of 7.6. Kewan Lacy, RB, Ole Miss: Lacy ran for 1,366 yards and 21 touchdowns this season as one of the most productive backs in all of college football. However, he had just 12 carries for 31 yards in the first meeting, and Ole Miss' fourth-quarter collapse happened in part because of a lack of commitment to running the ball. In the fourth quarter, they ran the ball one time (for 12 yards) on their three drives. Given Georgia's improvement in the second half of the season in getting pressure on the quarterback, Ole Miss is going to need to commit to giving Lacy the ball to create some offensive balance if they're going to keep the Dawgs' pass rushers from teeing off. C.J. Allen, LB, Georgia: The All-American linebacker sets the tone for the Georgia defense and will be leading the charge against Chambliss and Lacy. He does a bit of everything, leading the team in tackles (85) and tackles for loss (8) and is second in sacks (3.5), and he'll be at the center of the Bulldogs' plan to slow down the Ole Miss attack. He had 10 tackles in their first meeting and figures to be similarly active in this one. \nZachariah Branch, WR, Georgia: Branch is Georgia's big-play threat in the passing game, but it's often through the quick game and letting him go to work in the open field. Ole Miss will have to be locked in on the perimeter and their defensive backs are going to be challenged to make tackles in space. All it takes is one miss for Branch to create an explosive play, and the Dawgs will likely look to give him numerous opportunities to make that happen. Wydett Williams Jr., S, Ole Miss: This feels like a game where Ole Miss may need its defense to steal a possession or two via turnover. Georgia doesn't turn it over often, but if Ole Miss can make this thing a shootout again where Georgia feels the need to throw it downfield a bunch, Williams is the best bet to create a turnover. He leads the team with three interceptions and eight passes defended this season, and he might look to jump a route and create a big play to swing this game. Georgia vs. Ole Miss prediction, pick\nOle Miss will have some confidence that they can put up points on this Georgia defense, but I expect them to run into a different level of resistance from the Bulldogs this time around. I don't think Stockton will replicate his scintillating passing performance from the first meeting, but largely because he won't be asked to. This Georgia squad seems to be peaking at the right time and I just believe they're a tier above this Ole Miss squad. I wouldn't be surprised if the Rebels find some early offensive success on script, but I don't think it'll be as sustainable as the first meeting and, eventually, Georgia breaks it open and wins fairly comfortably. PICK: Georgia -6.5\n            ",

The Eagles want to keep Hurts healthy as they aim to repeat as Super Bowl champs.There are still some seeding implications for the Eagles, but the No. 1 seed in the NFC is out of reach. Philadelphia could finish as high as No. 2 or as low as No. 3. With the top seed out of play, the Eagles have chosen to rest their starting quarterback for the regular season finale.Eagles coach Nick Sirianni has shown a willingness to rest his stars before with McKee starting against the New York Giants in Week 18 last season. In that game, McKee completed 27 of his 41 passes for 269 yards and two touchdowns en route to a 20-13 win.This season, McKee has only seen action in three games, completing all three of his passes for 33 yards. A sixth-round pick out of Stanford in 2023, McKee has connected on 68.8% of his throws at the NFL level for 356 yards, four touchdowns and zero interceptions.\nIn the wake of the Eagles securing the NFC East crown, going back-to-back for the first time since 2001, Hurts said it's a special time for the franchise. Still, Hurts knows the team can't lose focus of the ultimate goal.\"I've said it multiple times: These times, they're rare times,\" Hurts said. \"So something that we all need to soak in and relish in this moment right now and take it a day at a time as we always have. But keep the main thing the main thing. Keep the main thing the main thing. That's what we've done for five years since everybody's collectively been here. That's been my approach since I've been an Eagle.\"\nThe Eagles will close out the 2025 regular season on Sunday afternoon when they kick off against the Commanders at 4:25 p.m. ET. The game will air on CBS.\n            \n    ",

In claiming Diggs, the Packers will take on the $472,000 he's due for his base salary in Week 18. Diggs was waived by the Cowboys earlier this week after \"a cumulation of multiple factors both on and off the field,\" per CBS Sports insider Jonathan Jones. Among the final disputes between Diggs and the team came when Diggs reportedly requested to stay at home in Washington after Dallas' game against the Commanders on Christmas. The Cowboys denied that request, but Diggs opted to stay anyway and was waived days later. Now he will join a Packers team that is 9-6-1 and locked into the NFC's 7-seed. The Packers have lost three games in a row as injuries have piled up on both sides of the ball. Star pass rusher Micah Parsons is out for the season after suffering a torn ACL, while quarterback Jordan Love missed the Packers last game with a concussion and remains in protocol going into Week 18. \nDiggs will join a cornerback rotation led by Keisean Nixon, who has started all 16 games for Green Bay so far, but has been a bit shaky beyond Nixon. Carrington Valentine (11 starts) and Nate Hobbs (five starts) have occupied the spot opposite Nixon this season, but Diggs will give the Packers another potential option in the defensive backfield. How quickly Diggs can get up to speed with the defense and whether he'll get on the field in Week 18 remains to be seen, but the Packers will hope to get him comfortable enough with at least some packages to contribute once the playoffs arrive. \nDiggs played in eight games for the Cowboys this season, starting six, and had 25 tackles in 2025 for Dallas. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        No. 3 Georgia will seek redemption in the Sugar Bowl on Thursday, when it takes on No. 6 Ole Miss inside the Superdome in New Orleans. The Bulldogs were in an identical situation a year ago in the College Football Playoff semifinal when they were eliminated by a surging Notre Dame team that finished as the national runner up.Back then, UGA was relying on unproven quarterback Gunner Stockton, who was making his first career start in a high-stakes showdown against one of the nation's best defenses. This time around, Stockton is a seasoned veteran who emerged as one of the nation's top QBs while guiding the Bulldogs to an SEC championship.On the other side, Ole Miss will also be seeking some redemption after the Rebels lost 43-35 at Georgia on Oct. 18. Head coach Lane Kiffin has since departed for LSU, leaving Ole Miss in the care of new coach Pete Golding for the program's first-ever CFP appearance.Despite the strangely timed coaching transition, the Rebels looked strong in a 41-10 first-round beatdown of Tulane. With star quarterback Trinidad Chambliss spearheading a dynamic offense, Ole Miss remains a force to be reckoned with.\nGeorgia is entering off a bye, but the Bulldogs were dominant in a 28-7 SEC title game win over Alabama. The UGA defense has gone four straight games without allowing more than 10 points.Georgia vs. Ole Miss: Need to know for Sugar BowlKewan Lacy's status: The top injury-related storyline entering the Sugar Bowl appears to be the health of Ole Miss star running back Kewan Lacy. The Missouri transfer exited the Rebels' first-round win over Tulane in the third quarter with an apparent shoulder injury. Though he returned, he appeared to be less than 100%, which has cast his status for the quarterfinals into doubt. Lacy is second nationally among all players with 21 rushing touchdowns. Though he tallied just 31 yards rushing on 12 carries in the Rebels' October loss at Georgia, he did score two touchdowns against the Bulldogs.The last meeting: Georgia scored on every offensive possession against Ole Miss in its 43-35 win over the Rebels on Oct. 18 until it was time to take a knee. It was an unbelievable performance from the UGA offense and quarterback Gunner Stockton. But that doesn't mean the victory came easy for the Bulldogs. Ole Miss proved unstoppable for three quarters and took a 35-26 lead into the fourth inside Sanford Stadium. Finally, when the game was on the line, Georgia's defense stepped up and came up with critical stops to hand Ole Miss its only loss of the season.\nNew coaching rivalry: Add another chapter to college football's long-running saga of former Nick Saban assistants coaching against each other. Georgia coach Kirby Smart and new Ole Miss coach Pete Golding each share the distinction of being former Alabama defensive coordinators who are now running their own SEC programs. Smart is the most-accomplished branch of the Saban tree, whereas Golding is just one game into his head coaching career and has a lot to prove. While they didn't overlap at Alabama, they learned under the same teacher, and both helped the Crimson Tide win national titles.  Where to watch Georgia vs. Ole Miss live  Date: Thursday, Jan. 1 | Time: 8 p.m. ET  Location: Caesars Superdome -- New Orleans, Louisiana  TV: ESPN | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)Georgia vs. Ole Miss prediction, picks  \nSince giving up 35 points against Ole Miss in a 43-35 home victory over the Rebels on Oct. 18, Georgia has grown into one of college football's premier defensive outfits. The Bulldogs' last four opponents have averaged a paltry 7.25 points per game as coordinator Glenn Schumann's unit has developed the teeth needed to make UGA a legitimate national championship contender. It's hard to imagine Ole Miss playing as perfectly offensively as it did through the first three quarters of the first meeting. Look for Georgia's defense to come up with enough key stops to help Georgia pull away and reach the semifinals. Pick: Georgia -6.5\n\n                    \n    \n

    "body": "\n        The 2025 College Football Playoff field will see a downsizing from eight to four over two days of action, starting with a New Year's Eve showdown between (10) Miami and (2) Ohio State in the Cotton Bowl. The marquee matchup marks the first time the two blue blood brands have faced off since the 2003 BCS National Championship. New Year's Day begins with (5) Oregon facing (4) Texas Tech in the Orange Bowl. Later in the day, (1) Indiana will face (9) Alabama with a spot in the semifinals on the line. The Crimson Tide became the first team in the expanded playoff format to win a game on the road when they knocked off (8) Oklahoma.The final quarterfinal matchup will feature (6) Ole Miss take on (3) Georgia in the Sugar Bowl. The Bulldogs defeated the Rebels 43-35 earlier this season in Athens, which marked Ole Miss' first loss of the 2025 campaignAs the College Football Playoff continues, here's a viewer's guide to help you navigate all the quarterfinal games through New Year's Day.All times Eastern\nCollege Football Playoff quarterfinal TV scheduleCotton Bowl -- (10) Miami vs. (2) Ohio State -- Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. on ESPN, fuboTV (try for free): Miami won its first CFP game in program history in a low-scoring battle against Texas A&M on the road. The Hurricanes' reward? A date with reigning national champion Ohio State on New Year's Eve. The Buckeyes are fresh off their first loss of the season to Indiana in the Big Ten title game. Ohio State star wide receiver Jeremiah Smith, who happens to be from South Florida, will face a team and place he is familiar with. Smith has already talked about the 2003 Fiesta Bowl between Miami and Ohio State in the days leading up to the game.Orange Bowl -- (5) Oregon vs. (4) Texas Tech -- Thursday at noon on ESPN, fuboTV (try for free): Oregon has a chance at CFP quarterfinal redemption after getting blown out against Ohio State last season in the Rose Bowl as the No. 1 overall seed. The Ducks are coming off a win over James Madison in the first round and will face a stout Texas Tech defense with a spot in the semifinals on the line. The Red Raiders are making their first appearance in the CFP after winning the Big 12 title.Rose Bowl -- (9) Alabama vs. (1) Indiana -- Wednesday at 4 p.m. on ESPN, fuboTV (try for free): Out of all the quarterfinal games on deck, this game has the chance to be the best one. Alabama is coming off a dramatic comeback win over Oklahoma in the first round, while Indiana is riding high on its best season in program history after knocking off Ohio State in the Big Ten title game. Indiana is led by Heisman Trophy winner and potential No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, Fernando Mendoza. One of the questions to ponder: Will Alabama wide receiver Ryan Williams be involved? He finished with just one catch for five yards against OU.\nSugar Bowl -- (6) OIe Miss vs. (3) Georgia -- Thursday at 8 p.m. on ESPN, fuboTV (try for free): The last time Ole Miss played Georgia, Lane Kiffin was still on the sidelines. That obviously is no longer the case, as Kiffin accepted the job at LSU before the Rebels played in the CFP. Ole Miss defeated Tulane in the first round -- which also happened to be another rematch from the regular season -- for its first CFP win in program history. As for Georgia, quarterback Gunner Stockton made his first career start in last season's Sugar Bowl against Notre Dame.\n            ",

    "body": "\nSportsLine NFL expert Jeff Hochman is back with another betting system, this time for Week 18. Betting on Week 18 games can be tricky considering some teams are resting starters ahead of the postseason while others are just trying to get across the finish line, but Hochman has identified an intriguing system targeting underdogs eliminated from playoff contention against playoff-hopeful squads. The \"Spoiler\" System (Eliminated vs. Playoff Hopefuls)Win Rate: 108-69-4 ATS (61%)Sample Size: Since 2009Criteria: Any eliminated underdog playing against a team fighting for seed or berthEdge: Spreads of +7 or higherWhy does this work?The public overwhelmingly bets on teams that \"need\" the win to make the playoffs, assuming they will play harder. In reality, the pressure often causes these teams to play tight, while the eliminated team plays loose, aggressive and \"spoiler-minded\" football. Oddsmakers inflate the line for the \"motivated\" team because they know the public will pay a \"motivation tax.\" This creates value on the underdog.Week 18 qualifiersTennessee Titans +12.5 at Jacksonville Jaguars | Confidence: 5 out of 5  \nCan the Titans, standing at 3-13, cash as a double-digit underdog for the fifth time this season? They have nothing to lose. The Jaguars feel all the pressure as they chase the No. 1 seed, even if their chances are slim. If you've watched these end-of-season divisional games before, you know they're always unpredictable, much like the chaos that defines Week 1. More often than not, double-digit underdogs seem to cover because the favorites just want to get the win and move on -- they're not out to run up the score. If Jacksonville builds a lead, they might bench their starters or shift into cruise control. That could open the door for the Titans to slip in a late cover.Jacksonville comes in hot at 12-4, riding a seven-game winning streak both outright and against the spread. The Jags have already punched their ticket to the postseason and are mostly just wrapping up the division, as there's not much at stake since Houston is behind in the tiebreaker and Jacksonville is almost certainly landing the No. 3 seed. When you look at the playoff picture, the Jaguars have just a 3% shot at the top seed, a 26% chance at the No. 2 seed and are most likely to end up as the No. 3 seed at nearly 60%. In other words, Jacksonville is probably more focused on getting through this game healthy than chasing the slimmest of playoff advantages.\nJacksonville's seven-game winning streak has a lot to do with its defense stepping up in a big way. Over the past five weeks, the Jaguars have held opponents to just 15.8 points per game and have forced at least two turnovers in every contest, piling up 19 takeaways in seven contests. Still, relying on turnovers every week isn't a sustainable strategy in the NFL.On the flip side, the Titans are 3-13 and totally out of the playoff picture. You might think they'd have checked out by now, but that's not the case -- they've actually looked much better lately. Over their last four games, they've split 2-2 both straight up and against the spread, and those losses were by just one score. They've covered the spread in five of their last eight games. While the season's been rough, the team is still showing plenty of fight under interim head coach Mike McCoy.The Titans have quietly gone 5-1 against the spread in their last six games after a straight-up loss, including last week's close one against the Saints. They're also looking to get even after dropping the Week 13 matchup as 6-point home underdogs. This line looks pretty high to me -- my numbers make the home team only a 10.5-point favorite. I'm factoring in recent performance, motivation, injuries, and strength of schedule -- data points the market might see differently. Since everyone seems to be on the Jaguars, I'll take the other side with the sportsbooks and root for the underdog to come through.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Baltimore Ravens surprisingly have one more chance to potentially save their season when they visit the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 18. Whether Lamar Jackson (back contusion) would be a part of that effort remains up in the air, though things are trending in a positive direction as Jackson was a full participant in Wednesday's practice.Baltimore coach John Harbaugh told reporters, \"He looked good,\" after watching Jackson practice.Harbaugh said on Monday that the team would have more information about its star quarterback's status come their first practice, saying, \"He's coming off a very serious injury, and he's working at it -- saw him in here today working at it -- so I think we'll know a lot more on Wednesday.\"If Harbaugh's words on Wednesday are any indication, they'll have the two-time MVP under center with their playoff hopes on the line in Week 18 when the Ravens play the Steelers with the AFC North on the line.\nJackson dealt with a plethora of injuries this year, not just an early-season hamstring strain (missed three games) and his current back contusion. Ankle, toe and knee issues and popped up for Jackson on the injury report throughout the year, and he has had just one full week of practice since returning from the hamstring injury. The back contusion was significant enough that Jackson struggled to even toss a ball with a member of the team's training staff in the locker room during the Week 16 game against the New England Patriots, and he did not practice at all leading up to last week's game against the Green Bay Packers.\"It was not good at all early in the week, and it improved as the week went on, and that was cause for optimism,\" Harbaugh said Monday.\n        \n            \n                NFL playoff picture: Ravens-Steelers decide AFC North in Week 18; Seahawks-49ers play for No. 1 seed in NFC\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAfter Week 16, the Ravens' playoff hopes appeared slim: Baltimore blew a 11-point fourth quarter lead in a 28-24 loss to New England -- a game Jackson left in the first half after getting kneed in the back by safety Craig Woodson. \nFurthermore, the Steelers dramatically held off the Detroit Lions, 29-24. That meant either a Ravens loss or a Steelers win in Week 17 would hand the division to Pittsburgh. But the Ravens did their part, beating the Packers 41-24 behind a 216-yard, four-touchdown performance by Derrick Henry and solid play by Jackson's backup, Tyler Huntley, on Saturday night. Then the Cleveland Browns upset the Steelers 13-6 on Sunday, pushing the AFC North race to the final week.Huntley, 27, would again get the call against Pittsburgh if Jackson cannot play. He went 16 for 20 for 107 yards and a touchdown and ran for 60 yards against Green Bay.\"A+,\" Harbaugh said after the game. \"A+. Give [Huntley] two pluses on top of that, maybe three. That's how it was. It couldn't have been any better. I just thought [he had] some of the clutch plays -- the kind of plays that you have to make. I see Tyler every day in practice, so I'm not surprised. I see him execute every day in practice, but for him to make the third-down conversions, the scramble plays, the throws, the on-time throws, the accurate throws that he made to run the offense in Lambeau field -- it's loud. In Lambeau Field, to run the offense the way he did, make the checks the way he did, get us in the plays we needed to get in, just A+.\"\nHarbaugh said Monday that the team's confidence in Huntley would not factor into the Jackson decision and that if Jackson is ready to play, he will play.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Once dubbed by the legendary Keith Jackson as \"The Granddaddy of them All,\" the Rose Bowl has changed dramatically in recent years -- a reflection of college football as a whole. While it no longer features the best of the Big Ten and the Pac-12, it's still one of the most anticipated events on the college football calendar every year as an annual site for the College Football Playoff quarterfinal.What hasn't changed is the time the game is played, or the beautiful setting. Also, as luck would have it, the Big Ten champion will play in the game this year, with the No. 1 Indiana Hoosiers squaring off against No. 9 Alabama.This is Indiana's second straight season reaching the College Football Playoff, and the Hoosiers are hoping it goes better than last year when they lost a first-round game at Notre Dame. Alabama did not make the 12-team field last season, but is a playoff regular, and came back from a 17-0 deficit to beat No. 8 Oklahoma in the first round.It's the first matchup between these two schools with very different backgrounds, and the winner will move on to face the winner of the Orange Bowl in the Peach Bowl on Jan. 9.\nAlabama vs. Indiana: Need to know for Rose BowlThis is the first time Indiana will play a game as the No. 1 team in the country: When the Hoosiers beat Ohio State in the Big Ten Championship it didn't just result in their first Big Ten championship since 1967, it moved them to No. 1 in the CFP poll as well as the AP Top 25. It's the first time in history the Hoosiers have been No. 1 in the AP poll, which means that when they take the field in Pasadena, it'll be the first time they've played a game as the No. 1 team in the country. How ironic that it comes against the program that's been considered the most dominant of the BCS and playoff era?  Alabama has been to more Rose Bowls than Indiana: The SEC has never had a tie-in with the Rose Bowl, but this will be Alabama's ninth appearance in the game. The Tide were last here for a College Football Playoff semifinal against Michigan on New Year's Day of 2024, losing to the Wolverines. They also won a Rose Bowl during the 2020 College Football Playoff. Their last trip to the game that wasn't a playoff appearance was in 1945, which was one of their six appearances from 1926 to 1946.  Fernando Mendoza is the first Heisman winner in Indiana program history: Given Indiana's lack of overall success in football, this shouldn't come as a surprise. Mendoza won the Heisman Trophy this year after leading the Hoosiers to an undefeated season and a Big Ten title. It's his first year with Indiana, as he began his college football career at California before transferring to the Big Ten. It seems the move was a wise decision on Mendoza's part.\n  Where to watch Alabama vs. Indiana live  Date: Thursday, Jan. 1 | Time: 4 p.m. ET  Location: The Rose Bowl -- Pasadena, California  TV: ESPN | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)Alabama vs. Indiana prediction, picks  \nThe total for this one feels a little low. I'm not expecting a shootout, but I do believe both offenses are capable of moving the ball against these opposing defenses. Oklahoma probably should've scored more than it did against Alabama in the first round, and while Indiana's defense has been exceptional, it has been prone to allowing explosive passes this season, which is an area Alabama thrives. Won't be a shootout, but it won't be a rock fight, either. Pick: Over 48.5\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n

    "body": "\n        FRISCO, Texas -- To those on the outside looking in, the Dallas Cowboys' decision to release two-time Pro Bowl cornerback Trevon Diggs on Tuesday may appear abrupt. However, this dissention between Diggs and the organization has been brewing for some time.  Cowboys coach Brian Schottenheimer acknowledged as much on Wednesday. \"It was really an accumulation of multiple factors. Performance, other elements. He's been an incredible player for this organization and ... I like Trevon a lot,\" Schottenheimer said. \"I wish him nothing but the best. I'm excited to see where he lands and continue his career.\"The divorce between Diggs and Dallas has been brewing since the offseason, He skipped out on OTAs to rehab from a knee procedure, publicly clashed with defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus over the rate of zone coverage versus man coverage and had an awkward, extended stay on injured reserve after he and the team disagreed about his health regarding his knee and a home accident that resulted in a concussion. The final straw or cherry on top of the disconnection sundae was Diggs' request to fly back from the Cowboys Christmas Day win over the Washington Commanders by himself since he has family in the DC metro area. Schottenheimer's and the team's protocol is that everyone flies back on the team plane after every game outside of exceptions for family emergencies. Diggs chose to stay back anyway after Schottenheimer denied his request. \"Yeah, it was one of many factors, it was not the only factor. I'm not the Grinch that stole Christmas, okay. I love Christmas. I love my family,\" Schottenheimer said. \"But at the end of the day, we got a protocol we go through and the process was not followed. The first time I heard about it, Trevon grabbed me after the game and I'm celebrating a big win and I explained to him the protocol, which it's always been the protocol of we go up as a team, we come back as a team. He decided to make a different decision. It was not the only reason that this decision was made. ... But at the end of the day, I want to make this very clear. That was not the only reason that this happened. This happened for multiple factors, performance and other elements over the course of time. And I truly do wish him nothing but the best. I told him that yesterday when I talked to him.\"  \n\n        \n            \n                Trevon Diggs joins Packers: Green Bay claims former Cowboys cornerback off waivers to bolster playoff depth\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Cowboys have moved on from the Diggs decision quickly. Schottenheimer addressed his locker room about Dallas' decision to move on from All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons, but he didn't feel the need to do so with the move off of Diggs. \"I think the biggest one that we probably addressed was the Micah [Parsons] trade, and that was the start of the season and all of that. I've had conversations with a couple of players, but I didn't feel like I had to stand up in front of the room,\" Schottenheimer said. \"Guys can come talk to me. I talk to you guys every day. They know my door is always open, and if they have questions or concerns, I would love to talk about it, but I'm going to say this again, this decision that was made was very difficult. ... To me, this team and what we're building, this culture that we're building is about the 53 strongest, most connected group of people. I believe that, and that's why the team element to me is so important.\"Dallas terminated Diggs' five-year, $97 million extension with three seasons remaining, but they'll now only be responsible for a $5.9 million cap charge in 2026 while not owing the 27-year-old a cent in terms of actual cash going forward. The 2021 NFL interceptions leader posted a goodbye statement on Instagram shortly after his release. \n\"I want to thank the Dallas Cowboys organization for the opportunity they gave me and for changing my life, both on and off the field. I'll always be grateful for what my time here meant for me and my family,\" Diggs posted. \"I want to thank all the coaches and staff who believed in me, pushed me, and helped me grow as a player and as a man. I'm thankful for the relationships and brotherhood I built in that locker room—those bonds will always mean a lot to me. With that said, I'm excited for a new journey and a fresh start. I'm motivated, focused, and ready for what's next. To the fans who supported me throughout this journey, you are truly appreciated. Thank you for the love and support along the way. God is great.\"What's next for both Dallas and DiggsThe Cowboys cornerback room is obviously guaranteed to look different in 2026, but there are a few key contributors who will return. Pro Bowler DaRon Bland, who re-signed with the Cowboys on a four-year, $90 million extension shortly after the Micah Parsons trade, will be back. He did reaggravate the foot he suffered a stress fracture in at the end of training camp in 2024, and he'll be working closely with the Cowboys training staff to get right in the offseason. Rookie third-round pick Shavon Revel is someone Dallas sees as a high potential player the further removed he is from the torn ACL injury he suffered his last season at East Carolina in 2024. Any further upgrades the team would like to do to the position in the offseason will likely be veteran bargain bin signings in free agency. The Cowboys do have two first-round picks in 2026, the extra one from the Green Bay Packers because of the Parsons trade, but Dallas doesn't have a second round pick (Quinnen Williams trade) or a third round pick (George Pickens trade) in the upcoming draft. Other defensive needs at edge rusher and linebacker could be seen as more glaring than their cornerback position. \n\"It's certainly an area we'll look at. We got a guy in Shavon Revel that we like. We like Caelen Carson. Trikweze Bridges is a talented young player that needs development and seasoning. You guys get it,\" Schottenheimer said. \"You guys have been around this business. Personnel changes fast. I told the guys today, today is the last Wednesday of the 2025 Dallas Cowboys. So be grateful for that. Enjoy that. Celebrate that. Because this team will never be back together for another Wednesday. And that's the life of an NFL employee. There's gonna be change. I like some of the pieces that we have. And we'll always be looking to add and keep putting the puzzle together.\"  Diggs already found a new home in a reunion with Parsons as a Green Bay Packer. Green Bay claimed him off of waivers on Wednesday with the playoff-bound Packers picking up the $472,000 he's due for his base salary in Week 18. Green Bay is 9-6-1 and locked into the NFC's No. 7 seed. He'll have a chance to become a part of a cornerback rotation with Keisean Nixon, Carrington Valentine and Nate Hobbs. Green Bay has allowed a 92.8 passer rating this season, which ranks 18th in the NFL in 2025. The Packers needed bodies with Kamal Hadden (leg) out for the season and Hobbs currently sidelined with a knee injury he suffered in Week 17 against the Baltimore Ravens. Diggs played in eight games for the Cowboys this season, starting six, and had 25 tackles in 2025 for Dallas.   Parsons is already celebrating his BFF following him up north to Green Bay for the postseason while he recovers from a torn ACL.\nDiggs' on-field fit with the Packers in defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley's scheme will be an interesting storyline to follow. Hafley's Green Bay defense runs zone on 79.3% of plays per TruMedia, the eighth-highest rate in the NFL. Diggs and Cowboys defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus clashed on Dallas' zone vs. man coverage mix. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The College Football Playoff meeting to feature two top-five teams this season will happen in the quarterfinals at the Orange Bowl, when No. 4 Texas Tech takes on No. 5 Oregon. The Ducks enter the game with one CFP win under their belts this postseason, rolling over James Madison by a 51-34 final score in the first round. The Red Raiders earned a bye to the quarterfinals after going 12-1 in the regular season and winning the Big 12 Championship, setting a slew of school records in what is already one of the most successful seasons ever for Texas Tech. It should be no surprise that these two teams have reached the point of being two wins away from playing for a national championship. Texas Tech and Oregon both rank in the top 11 nationally for scoring offense and scoring defense, as well as total offense and total defense. They have a combined 24-2 record, and the combined margin of those two losses is just 14 points. It may be the first-ever appearance in the College Football Playoff for the Red Raiders, and just the third for the Ducks, but these are two programs that have clearly mastered the art of roster-building in the modern era and will be considered contenders on a frequent basis. Even though the future is bright for both schools and programs in this celebratory moment, the focus is on the present and doing what's necessary to advance to the CFP semifinal at the Peach Bowl and continue the pursuit of a national championship. Because while 12 wins and a playoff appearance have made this a successful campaign, neither of these top-five title contenders is ready for the season to end yet.   Oregon vs. Texas Tech: Need to know for Orange BowlTexas Tech among the most dominant teams all-time: The Red Raiders have outscored their opponents 555-142 overall, boasting an FBS-best +31.5 average point differential. And this is not a season that has been skewed by one or two blowouts and a handful of nail-biters along the way. Each of Texas Tech's 12 victories have come by at least 20 points, making this year's group just the fifth team in the AP poll era (since 1936) to record 12 or more wins by 20-plus points. The 2018 Clemson Tigers hold the record with 13 wins by 20+ points, the Red Raiders have tied themselves with 1971 Nebraska, 2013 Florida State and 2018 Alabama as teams to win by 20 points or more a dozen times. In search of explosiveness: The Orange Bowl may feature two of the top defenses in the land, but those groups will be tested by two of the most explosive offenses around. Oregon leads the nation with 91 plays of 20-plus yards this season, but Texas Tech is right on their heels ranking second with 90. The skill talent on both teams is capable of turning ordinary plays into extraordinary gains, making it key for both of those elite defenses to be dialed in on every detail.  \nDante Moore is a difference maker: Oregon quarterback Dante Moore could have an NFL Draft decision in his future, but first he's got an opportunity to extend what's been a stellar first season as the Ducks' starter. The one-time Oregon commit who started his career at UCLA before transferring back, Moore spent last season backing up Dillon Gabriel before assuming the starter's role in the offseason. Heading into the Orange Bowl, Moore is tied for No. 3 nationally in completion percentage (72.4), fifth nationally in passer rating (170.08) and tied for seventh with 28 touchdown passes on the year. He was locked in during Oregon's CFP opener, completing 19-of-27 passes for a career-high 313 yards and four touchdowns in the 51-34 win, showing no rust from the layoff heading into the postseason.  Where to watch Oregon vs. Texas Tech live  Date: Thursday, Jan. 1 | Time: 12 p.m. ET  Location: Hard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Florida  TV: ESPN | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)  Oregon vs. Texas Tech prediction, picks  \nThis game sets up to be a chess match throughout the afternoon, with both Oregon and Texas Tech looking to set up and eventually execute explosive plays against elite defenses. It's a chess match that will be fascinating to watch play out and likely set up a close game deep into the second half. It's just at some point we're going to need a quarterback to make a game-saving or game-winning play and right now I'd rather side with Dante Moore in that discussion. He's made some huge throws late in games this season and I like his odds more to be able and do so again.  Pick: Oregon -2.5 \n\n                    \n    \n

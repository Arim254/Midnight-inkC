    "body": "\n        The first UFC event of the landmark media rights deal with Paramount takes place on Saturday when the Octagon lands in Las Vegas for UFC 324. The card is loaded with former champions, record holders and rising stars, making for a potentially explosive Paramount+ debut.In the night's main event, Paddy Pimblett will meet Justin Gaethje for the interim lightweight championship. Gaethje is a former interim champ and also held the symbolic BMF title, while this is Pimblett's first chance as UFC gold.There's also sure to be plenty of buzz when the co-main event hits the Octagon as former bantamweight champion Sean O'Malley takes on Song Yadong. The pair are both looking to remain relevant in a suddenly interesting title picture after Petr Yan scored a stunning upset of Merab Dvalishvili at UFC 323. O'Malley owns a win over Yan in a non-title fight and could get himself right back in contention with a win on Saturday after back-to-back losses to the former champ Dvalishvili. Yadong is 3-1 in his last four fights.There are plenty more big fights and familiar names on the card, which takes place from T-Mobile Arena and streams live on Paramount+.\nSign up for Paramount+ and watch UFC 324 live on Saturday night for no additional fee -- every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with the price of your subscription!

It should go without saying that Pimblett will need to show a sturdy chin early and live up to his slogan that \"Scousers don't get knocked out.\" But for as dangerous as Gaethje is, Pimblett holds a distinct advantage on the ground with his submission game opposite a strong amateur wrestling background for Gaethje that surprisingly never gets utilized in his UFC bouts. Pimblett will take his time and eventually expose the aging chin of his 37-year-old opponent in a breakthrough win. Pimblett via TKO4Brookhouse: Gaethje hasn't been very active in recent years and is now 37. Add in that he's taken a more patient and tactical approach to fighting in the later stages of his career and I think you have the recipe for Pimblett to win this fight. Pimblett has the length to punish Gaethje on the outside and can tangle Gaethje up and use trips to take the fight to the ground. If the fight hits the floor, that's far more Pimblett's world, whether he is attacking with submissions or dominating position to deliver strikes. This feels like a great fight for Pimblett to get the biggest win of his career. Pimblett via SUB2Mahjouri: I promised to stop picking against Pimblett after he thrashed Michael Chandler. He doesn't make it easy. Statistically, it's hard to see Pimblett's path to victory.  Pimblett is a dual-finishing threat, but falls short in key categories. Gaethje is the more powerful and experienced striker with surprisingly higher striking defense. Pimblett has the biggest advantage on the ground, but historically lacks the offensive wrestling required to take the fight there. What these overall statistics don't conclude are their recent trajectories. Pimblett, 31, makes meaningful improvements from fight to fight. Chandler and King Green are indeed over the hill, but Pimblett beat them with such ease that you can't dismiss his growth. Gaethje, 37, is nearing the end by his own admission. Pimblett will properly prepare for this dangerous task. He'll know to keep his chin down -- a recurring bad habit of his -- against a juggernaut like Gaethje. Pimblett via SUB4\nMormile: Gaethje via TKOWise: Gaethje via UDSean O'Malley vs. Song Yadong predictionsCampbell: O'Malley badly needs a win following back-to-back title losses to former champion Merab Dvalishvili. But the fact that Petr Yan, who defeated Dvashvili in their December rematch to once again become bantamweight king, holds a 2022 loss to O'Malley by split decision means that a rematch could be next if \"Suga\" can keep pace atop the division rankings. For as strong and solid as Yadong has become at age 28 following eight years as a UFC fighter, his style is still too basic for O'Malley not to expose over 15 minutes with his dynamic striking attack. While Yadong is durable enough to prevent O'Malley from delivering a highlight-reel statement and should prove able to keep the fight competitive, expect a return to form from the former champion. O'Malley via UDBrookhouse: We've seen O'Malley struggle against men who bring heavy pressure and can make him uncomfortable with grappling. Yadong isn't that fighter, though. Yadong is a good striker, but he is going to struggle to stay in his striking range, while O'Malley can work from the outside and utilize his length. Yadong doesn't really have the game to force O'Malley out of his comfort zone or rhythm and that should let O'Malley cruise to a decision win. O'Malley via UDMahjouri: O'Malley still has life in him as an elite bantamweight. He admits taking consecutive fights against Dvalishvili was a mistake, and took ample time off to address nagging injuries. He's a precise, powerful striker with a solid grappling game. Song is one of the more well-rounded fighters in the division, but his experience with elite bantamweights suggests his ceiling is below the title level. Song's win over Henry Cejudo was too competitive, considering the future Hall of Famer retired one fight later. His losses to Cory Sandhagen and Yan further drive home the point. Song can certainly play spoiler, but I fear we forget how thoroughly O'Malley dissected Marlon Vera in their rematch. O'Malley via UD\nMormile: O'Malley via UDWise: Yadong via TKO2Cortes-Acosta vs. Lewis predictionsCampbell: With four wins in five appearances alone over the past 10 months, Cortes-Acosta has rapidly become a legitimate threat to the heavyweight title picture. But the grind of constantly being in training camp can become a grind that sneaks up on fighters over time. And Lewis, who claims he is entering this fight in arguably the best shape of his career, is the wrong fighter to potentially make a mistake against or have an off night. Even at 40, the UFC's record holder for career knockouts is still as dangerous as ever. Lewis has won three of his last four fights, all by stoppage, and still owns the ability to weather damage before delivering the dramatic finish. The fact that Lewis feels so healthy after years of nagging injuries and fluctuating weight should be taken seriously here. Lewis via KO2Brookhouse: Lewis has an unbelievable ability to find ways to land fight-ending bombs against almost anyone, so he can never be counted out in any fight. That said, Cortes-Acosta is the more well-rounded fighter and has shown the ability to shift from striking to a measured, slower-paced approach to neutralizing dangerous big men. Cortes-Acosta may be willing to risk some exchanges early, but he'll likely shift to takedowns to try and keep Lewis grounded and away from throwing his looping power shots. It may not be pretty, but this is a fight Cortes-Acosta can grind away with repeated takedowns. Cortes-Acosta via decisionMahjouri: The jury is out on Cortes-Acosta. Is he a legitimate elite heavyweight or the type of hype train that Lewis feeds on? I believe it's the former. Cortes-Acosta has won seven of his last eight fights and took a round off interim title challenger Serghei Pavlovich in his lone loss during that stretch. It's Cortes-Acosta's striking defense that inspires confidence. Don't let his recent string of knockouts fool you; he knows how to stay safe and win fights over 15 minutes. Cortes-Acosta should employ a responsible style, mixing distance and footwork with carefully timed takedown attempts. If he can avoid Lewis' blitzes, an admittedly hard ask against the UFC KO record holder, he should win the fight on the scorecards or with a late knockout.

Bet it at bet365 here:Ohio State +15.5 vs. Michigan (-105)\nMichigan is playing for the fourth time in 10 days, with two of those games on the West Coast, so fatigue could be an issue for the Wolverines on Friday night. They have failed to cover the spread in five straight games, including their 86-72 win over Indiana on Tuesday. Ohio State has won three of its last four games, starting with a road win at Oregon earlier this month. The Buckeyes could use a win to improve their NCAA Tournament chances, especially against their rivals. While the model is not picking Ohio State to win outright, it has the Buckeyes covering the spread in 70% of simulations. Back Ohio State at bet365 here:Hawks +3 vs. Suns (-110)The Suns are riding a three-game winning streak, but they are playing the final game of a six-game road trip. Every game during that stretch has come down to the end, so they are in a difficult scheduling spot on Friday. Atlanta is coming off a 124-122 win at Memphis on Wednesday, as Jalen Johnson finished with 32 points and 15 rebounds. Newly acquired CJ McCollum had a key defensive play late in the game as well. The model has Atlanta winning outright and covering the spread 60% of the time on Friday. Back the Hawks at bet365 here:Over 214.5 in Bucks vs. Nuggets (-110)Denver and Milwaukee just met on Jan. 11, with the Nuggets notching a 108-104 win in a game that had a closing total of 218.5. However, there were a combined 13 missed free throws in that contest, along with both teams shooting worse than 45% from the floor. The Nuggets (49.8%) and Bucks (48.3%) both have better season-long field-goal percentages than they displayed in that game, and the missed free throws provide more room for scoring improvement on Friday. The model has the rematch cruising over the total, projecting 226 points to help the Over cash 68% of the time. Back the Over at bet365 here:\nLooking for NBA and college basketball picks?You've seen the model's best bets for Friday.

    "body": "\n        Saturday marks the first UFC event of the year, as well as the first UFC event of the Paramount Era, when UFC 324 comes to Las Vegas. The stacked card is headlined by an interim lightweight title fight between Justin Gaethje and Paddy Pimblett.Gaethje has already held the interim lightweight title once in his career, as well as holding the ceremonial BMF title, but has never managed to hold an undisputed UFC championship. Regaining the interim title on Saturday is likely Gaethje's last path to finally achieving that feat.To do so, Gaethje will have to get past a rising star in Pimblett, who is undefeated in his Octagon career and looking to score the biggest win of his career when he faces one of the most exciting fighters in MMA history.Sign up for Paramount+ and watch UFC 324 live on Saturday night for no additional fee -- every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with the price of your subscription! Plans start as low as $8.99/month or $89.99/year!\nThere's also sure to be plenty of buzz when the co-main event hits the Octagon as former bantamweight champion Sean O'Malley takes on Song Yadong. The pair are both looking to remain relevant in a suddenly interesting title picture after Petr Yan scored a stunning upset of Merab Dvalishvili at UFC 323. O'Malley owns a win over Yan in a non-title fight and could get himself right back in contention with a win on Saturday after back-to-back losses to the former champ Dvalishvili. Yadong is 3-1 in his last four fights.As with any UFC pay-per-view event, there's sure to be plenty of action at the sportsbook window, and with that in mind, we are taking a look at the best bet to make for every main card fight at UFC 324.  \n        \n            \n                UFC 324: Now more mature, Paddy Pimblett can make good on lofty expectations he had upon his UFC debut\n                \n                    Brent Brookhouse                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAfter going 31-25 for our best bets in 2025, we'll look keep our roll going to start the year on Saturday, with our only rule remaining that all bets must be at odds of -250 or better. Let's take a look at this week's picks with odds via DraftKings Sportsbook. Bet UFC 324 at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:\nArnold Allen\tvs.\tJean SilvaJean Silva via KO/TKO/DQ or submission +120Silva is a -258 favorite and you can get a line on him to win via either KO or decision at -250. Still, it seems the value is in taking Silva by some form of stoppage. Allen is a tough fighter who has never been stopped in his career. But Silva is nasty and dynamic in his attack, presenting a lot of problems for opponents. Allen has also been sidelined since a July 2024 win over Giga Chikadze. Coming back after a year and a half on the sidelines and having to face someone who brings the kind of wild pace that Silva does is a big ask. Silva's game is a little too wild at times, and Diego Lopes delivered a crushing reality check with a TKO win over Silva in September, but Silva has the right kind of opportunity to bounce back in a big way against Allen, who has lost two of his three most recent fights.Natalia Silva\tvs.\tRose NamajunasNatalia Silva via decision (-225)The line has moved slightly, with Namajunas having been around +320 a few days ago and now sitting at +300. This is a tough fight for the multiple-time former strawweight champion. Silva is on an absolute tear right now, with a 7-0 record in the Octagon and back-to-back wins over former UFC champions Jessica Andrade and Alexa Grasso. Namajunas' best chance to win is to get the fight to the ground, but Silva has shown excellent takedown defense against very good fighters. Namajunas has found ways to claw back from the brink of falling out of contention several times in her career, but Silva appears to be at the head of the next wave of flyweights. Five of Silva's seven UFC wins have come via decision and Namajunas seems unlikely to get stopped in a three-round fight, even if Silva gets the win.Waldo Cortes-Acosta\tvs.\tDerrick LewisOver 1.5 rounds (-145)Heavyweight is always something of a crapshoot, and it's entirely possible that picking the over in a fight involving UFC's all-time leader in knockouts (Lewis with 16) is the wrong play. Still, Lewis is facing a man in Cortes-Acosta who has played it safe in many of his fights. While he has back-to-back impressive knockouts of Ante Delija and Shamil Gaziev, it feels like Cortes-Acosta knows that the easiest path to victory is probably to work for takedowns off of leg kicks and try to score a grinding win. Lewis is good at getting up after being taken down, but he only defends takedowns at a 52% clip. That should lead to a fight that gets past the halfway point unless Lewis can find the opportunity to land one of his patented bombs for an early knockout.\nSean O'Malley\tvs.\tSong YadongSean O'Malley moneyline (-205)After winning the bantamweight title, O'Malley ran into the exact wrong kind of opponent in Merab Dvalishvili. Dvalishvili's relentless pace and takedown attack served as the perfect kryptonite to O'Malley's game. Fortunately for O'Malley, Yadong's game is nothing like that. Yadong does not have a strong takedown game and wants to operate on the feet. In the striking realm, O'Malley had the edge, with more creativity and sharpness, as well as high-level accuracy that should be enough for him to win almost every exchange. Add in that O'Malley knows this fight is close to do-or-die for his standing as a top bantamweight, and I expect the former champion to roll on Saturday night.\nJustin Gaethje\tvs.\tPaddy PimblettPaddy Pimblett moneyline (-230)Gaethje is the quintessential all-action fighter, and he has enough power to be a threat at any moment in any fight. Pimblett's length, creativity in pressuring with grappling and dynamic top game are going to present challenges for Gaethje, however. Gaethje is 37 and with a lot of miles on his body. He also has fought just once since his April 2024 last-second knockout loss to Max Holloway at UFC 300. There are too many things working in Pimblett's favor entering this fight to pick against him getting the biggest win of his career in the first main event of the Paramount era.Who wins Gaethje vs. Pimblett, and how exactly does the fight end? Visit SportsLine now to get detailed picks and analysis from the incomparable expert who is up over $21,000 on his UFC picks since May 19, 2018, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        While it should come as no surprise to any MMA fan why all-action legend Justin Gaethje is nicknamed \"The Highlight,\" following 14 unforgettable walks to the Octagon over the past eight years as a former UFC interim lightweight and BMF champion, the origin of the moniker dates back to 2011. Gaethje, who was just two months removed from concluding a Division I All-American run as a wrestler at the University of Northern Colorado, was a 21-year-old set for his pro MMA debut against future Bellator MMA and UFC veteran Kevin Croom at Ring of Fire 41 in Broomfield, Colorado. \"I had only wrestled [before] and had never been punched or thrown a punch in my life,\" Gaethje told CBS Sports on Tuesday. \"I picked [Croom] up and [Quinton] 'Rampage' [Jackson]-esque bodyslammed him. He was asleep for 10 minutes and pissed himself. I hate to tell that story because it's embarrassing for him but if he could push a button and change sides with me, he certainly would.\"Subscribe now to Paramount+ to get access to UFC 324 for as little as $8.99 per month\nGaethje, who would need just 61 seconds to finish Croom off by slamming him on his face, was anointed as \"The Highlight\" that night by the event's promoter. And nearly 15 years later, as the 37-year-old Gaethje (26-5) prepares for his final run at an elusive full UFC championship when he faces Paddy Pimblett (23-3) on Saturday for the interim 155-pound title in the main event of UFC 324 in Las Vegas, neither his mindset nor his ability to create violent and viral moments has changed.  \"I hope I make Paddy piss himself in front of millions of people on Saturday,\" Gaethje said.\nThe fighting career of Gaethje, who was raised in Safford, Arizona, has been as unique as any in the modern era of the sport. \nEven before he fully evolved from the standpoint of skills and technique as a pro fighter, he was finding success (and slowly building his name among hard-core fans) simply by outlasting his opponents in one all-out brawl after another. In his 11th pro fight, he captured the inaugural lightweight title in World Series of Fighting (which would later become PFL) and made five unforgettable title defenses. In 2017, Gaethje brought his 18-0 record to the UFC in the main event of \"The Ultimate Fighter: Redemption\" finale in Las Vegas against lightweight veteran Michael Johnson. The result was nearly 10 minutes of carnage highlighted by such insane and dramatic shifts of momentum that it looked more like a \"Rocky\" movie scene than a typical UFC fight. Gaethje, who twice rebounded from getting wobbled into near unconsciousness, rallied to stop Johnson late in Round 2 and cemented his iconic UFC debut by landing his patented backflip off the top of the Octagon wall. \n\"For me, personally, I think Michael Johnson was my favorite [fight],\" Gaethje said. \"He was ranked No. 5 at the time and it was my first time getting to come into the UFC and fight in front of a crowd like that. To prove that I was the best in the world and top five in the world was a great honor for me and something that I haven't stepped out of. I have been in the top five since 2017. We have seen guys come and go and I have been here the whole time.\"\nNot only did Gaethje prove he belonged despite engaging in a fighting style that appeared to be anything but sustainable over the longhaul, the victory kicked off an insane run of consistently great fights that have left many fans and critics debating the same question: Is it too much to declare that Justin Gaethje is the greatest action fighter in the history of MMA, if not all of combat sports? \"No, it's not [too much],\" UFC president and CEO Dana White told CBS Sports on Wednesday. \"[Gaethje] is never in a bad fight. The kid is always exciting and action-packed.\"\nBeing exciting typically only gets you so far in the UFC, particularly against elite competition. And even though Gaethje's name value was still buzzing from the sheer savagery of the Johnson fight, he would find out a humbling lesson in his next two fights when \"The Highlight\" finally met a pair of fellow lightweight legends in Eddie Alvarez and Dustin Poirier who could both endure Gaethje's unyielding offensive attack without folding. \"When I was young and I hadn't lost, I just said that I am going to go through these guys and try to kill them. They were never able to withstand my pressure,\" Gaethje said. \"Then, I started fighting the best guys in the world and I had to realize that I needed to use different variables to win.\"Even though Gaethje's back-to-back bouts against Alvarez and Poirier would only continue his run of producing fight-of-the-year contenders, he lost both fights via brutal late stoppages due to the accumulation of damage he had endured. The fallout would lead to a turning point in Gaethje's career following a series of conversations with career-long coach Trevor Wittman that forced Gaethje to understand that fighting smart and avoiding mistakes was just as important as aggression and attitude.\nGaethje, who made sure to emphasize that he agreed to change tactics but not his all-action mentality, ran off an immediate four-fight win streak of knockouts that culminated in a 2020 dismantling of Tony Ferguson at UFC 249 that saw Gaethje snap his opponent's 12-fight win streak and capture the interim lightweight title. \"Justin has grown so much as a fighter. He has become a lot more savvy and smart,\" Wittman told \"UFC Countdown\" cameras during a recent tour of his ONX Sports gym in Colorado. \"When his purpose used to be, 'I want to be the most exciting fighter out there,' he lived by that. Then, he wanted to go on a title run and we had to adjust to what his purpose was. Every time I asked him his purpose, he said, 'I want to be a champion but I want to make sure that if someone pays for an event, they will remember my fight.'\"But even though Gaethje succeeded in becoming an elite fighter without compromising his barbaric ethos, climbing that final hurdle to become full UFC champion wasn't meant to be. Gaethje would go on to twice fight for the lightweight crown and twice succumb to submissions in disappointing losses to Khabib Nurmagomedov in 2020 and against Charles Oliveira for the vacant title in 2022. \nGaethje, who would rebound in 2023 by avenging the loss to Poirier with a head-kick knockout win at UFC 291 to win the symbolic BMF title, still believes that his surefire Hall-of-Fame career remains incomplete without a lightweight title and that's the reason why he's embarking upon this final run. \"Of course, I have to that [title] in my body [of work],\" Gaethje said. \"I want to be the best in the world and prove that I am the best in the world. People need to understand how crazy this sport is. It's the most intriguing sport in the world because anything can happen at any moment. When a [football] team is up 42-10, there is no chance the [other] team is coming back. But when I was up 4-0 [in rounds] against Tony Ferguson, there was still a chance he could knock me out.\"Even though Gaethje enters the Pimblett fight on a bit of a rejuvenated run having won three of his last four (including a pair of hard-fought decisions against contender Rafael Fiziev), it was the one loss during that stretch -- a one-punch knockout at the hands of Max Holloway with one second to go in Round 5 of their BMF title bout at UFC 300 in 2024 -- that proved to be his true \"Welcome to the UFC\" moment of humbling, despite it having come 13 fights into his run.  \nIt's the reason why Gaethje has done nothing but show respect ahead of UFC 324 for the danger that his opponent brings after he failed to do the same inside the cage against Holloway. \"That's the first time I ever approached this game as this is just for fun,\" Gaethje said. \"I love what I do and I was just going to go out there to fight rather than understanding how dangerous what I do is. I've always convinced myself they are going to kill me and I've always been willing to kill them and that just wasn't where my mindset was in that fight. That was a come-to-Jesus moment that I better take it seriously, especially because it's the most serious repercussions that I suffered.\"It's the only time I have ever been knocked out and I know how detrimental that was to my family and I never want to put them through that again.\"\nEven though Wittman has said publicly that Gaethje will retire if he loses to Pimblett, those are words that Gaethje said never came from his mouth and currently aren't part of his plans. After having been a betting underdog in 10 of his 14 UFC fights, Gaethje is embracing that role once more against Pimblett and believes not only will he regain the interim title on Saturday, it will set him up for a White House fight in June against either full champion Ilia Topuria or the winner of the March 7 BMF title rematch between two fighters who previously beat him: Holloway and Oliveira. \"I'm happy I'm the underdog and I'm happy to be fighting someone so confident with so much momentum behind them because one thing you must understand in this game is, I don't care how confident you are, you better be perfect,\" Gaethje said. \"And he's going to make mistakes and I'm going to take advantage of his mistakes. I've said it before but I don't plan on being alive after Saturday night. I have to tell myself that he's going to kill me so that I can go into my most primal place.\"I love the pressure, I love the moments and I love the adrenaline -- it's the best drug in the world.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\nA trip to Super Bowl LX will be on the line Sunday with both the AFC and NFC Championship Games. In the AFC, Drake Maye and the New England Patriots take on backup quarterback Jarrett Stidham and the Denver Broncos, after Bo Nix had his season come to an end with an ankle injury. In the NFC, Matthew Stafford and the Los Angeles Rams will battle Sam Darnold and the Seattle Seahawks. New England enters the AFC title game as a 3.5-point favorite at DraftKings Sportsbook after opening as 5.5-point favorites. Seattle, meanwhile, is a 2.5-point home favorite for the NFC Championship, with the total at 46.5. The Seahawks won't have running back Zach Charbonnet (knee) for the rest of the NFL playoffs. Denver and New England are the top two seeds in the AFC, and the Broncos are tied for being the biggest home underdog in conference championship game history.

    "body": "\n        The 2025 NFL regular season is in the books, and change is already in the air. The offseason is a time of immense turnover, as players switch teams via free agency or trade, teams change their rosters by acquiring them through one of those avenues or in the draft, and plenty of clubs swap out their coaches as they look to improve from one year to the next.We're here today to talk about the latter group of teams. Nine NFL teams have fired their coaches and one, Mike Tomlin, has stepped down. The Titans and Giants fired Brian Callahan and Brian Daboll during the regular season.The Falcons fired Raheem Morris right after their season ended. On Black Monday, the Browns fired Kevin Stefanski, the Raiders fired Pete Carroll and the Cardinals fired Jonathan Gannon.A day later, the Ravens fired John Harbaugh after 18 seasons.Two days after that, the Dolphins fired Mike McDaniel.After a wild card round loss, Tomlin stepped down from his post as the Steelers head coach after 19 seasons. Following a playoff loss to the Broncos in the divisional round, the Bills entered the coaching hunt after firing Sean McDermott. Five hires have since been made -- including Harbaugh and Stefanski landing new jobs -- but five vacancies remain. Let's rank them in order of desirability.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. BillsThe Bills have arguably the best player in the league at the most important position in the sport in Josh Allen. That alone makes this the most coveted job of this cycle, after the Bills fired Sean McDermott after their latest playoff loss to the Denver Broncos. Pairing yourself next to Allen has championship potential, so every head coach who hasn't already accepted a job will almost certainly stop what they're doing and see if they can align themselves with Allen. \nOutside of the elite QB, Buffalo does have other things going for it. James Cook is coming off a 2025 regular season where he led the NFL in rushing, the defense allowed a league-low 156.9 passing yards per game, and they are just about to move into a brand new stadium. That said, whoever is hired will need to help improve a horrid run defense and get the most out of a lacking pass-catching group to truly help Allen get over the hump in the postseason. \n        \n            \n                Bills coaching search: Buffalo to interview Mike McDaniel with Josh Allen 'significantly' involved in process\n                \n                    Shanna McCarriston                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. RaidersThe Raiders are here for four reasons: Brock Bowers, Ashton Jeanty, the No. 1 pick in the draft and $100 million in cap room. (You could say five reasons and include Maxx Crosby, but there are already rumors swirling that the Raiders are finally willing to listen to trade offers for the star edge rusher, so he may not be long for Las Vegas.) There is just not much talent on this team outside of those players. There is a loooong way to go before the Raiders can be remotely competitive, and it doesn't help that they play in the AFC West, which is one of the most competitive divisions in football. Like the Titans, though, they can take a jump next season if they hit on their coach and whichever quarterback they presumably draft with the No. 1 pick, and spend their free-agent money to upgrade the talent level on the roster.\nOne drawback here is the ownership situation, where Mark Davis seems to flail wildly from one plan to the next in quick succession. The Vegas job is not exactly stable, and doesn't come with a lot of job security, as evidenced by all the changes the Raiders have made over the last several years. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. SteelersThe Pittsburgh Steelers have a patient ownership group under the Rooney family: they've only had three head coaches since the 1970 AFL/NFL merger. Their defense remains stout led by All-Pro edge rusher T.J. Watt with the Steelers generating three takeaways -- an interception and two fumbles recoveries -- off of Houston Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud in an eventual defeat thanks to their crumbling offense around Aaron Rodgers. This is an organization headed for a rebuild after five consecutive seasons with 9 or 10 wins with four of those years ending with wild card round defeats. \nPittsburgh does have $23.6 million in effective cap space according to OverTheCap.com, but this offseason doesn't have a great free agency quarterback class, notable considering the Steelers haven't had a long-term quarterback since Ben Roethlisberger's retirement after the 2021 season. The best options are Daniel Jones coming off of a torn Achiles, Rodgers entering his age-43 season or Green Bay Packers backup quarterback Malik Willis who shined in relief of Jordan Love the last two seasons. On the trade market, Kyler Murray is likely the best choice. Whoever takes this job will be tasked with helping the Steelers build around that elusive franchise quarterback, rebuild a stale offense and manage what's becoming a quickly aging defense.  \n        \n            \n                Nine years without a Steelers playoff win and the quiet cost of never losing enough in Pittsburgh\n                \n                    Ryan Wilson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. BrownsThe Browns have a good defense built around Myles Garrett, who is just an inhuman monster coming around the edge. They drafted a pair of star rookies in tight end Harold Fannin Jr. and linebacker Carson Schwesinger. They have multiple first-round picks in this year's draft thanks to last year's Travis Hunter trade. What the Browns don't have is much other talent on offense (Quinshon Judkins will be coming off a dislocated ankle and fractured fibula), an answer at quarterback or any cap space to solve their various issues. Cleveland is set to begin the offseason more than $12 million over the cap, according to Over the Cap, and it still has the albatross of Deshaun Watson's contract weighing down its books in both 2026 and 2027, at least.\nThe Browns also have an ownership and management situation that is, shall we say, not all that desirable. The Haslam family has run one of the most unstable organizations in the league, and Andrew Berry hasn't exactly put together a great roster. (The combination of the Haslams and Berry was responsible for the disastrous Watson trade.)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. CardinalsArizona lost 14 of its final 15 games this season and looked incredibly listless in doing so. The Cardinals have an uncertain quarterback situation with Kyler Murray seemingly not long for the team, and they really have no viable path to solving that situation this offseason unless it becomes a three-quarterback draft or the Jets decide to pass on someone like Dante Moore (if he enters) or Fernando Mendoza at No. 2 overall. Arizona is set to have only around $21 million in cap room (and only $9.8 million in effective cap space), per Over the Cap, so it's not like there are a lot of resources here to solve the various roster issues. \nThey do have players like Trey McBride, Michael Wilson, Paris Johnson Jr., Josh Sweat, Budda Baker, Garrett Williams, Walter Nolen and Will Johnson, but there are still a lot of holes here and not that much to build around.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        No coach in college football has been more apprehensive about the transfer portal than Clemson's Dabo Swinney, and after the way the 2026 transfer portal window ended for Clemson, Swinney isn't feeling any better about the new ways of the college football world. After signing former Cal linebacker Luke Ferrelli early in the portal window, the Tigers saw Ole Miss swoop in and flip Ferrelli to Oxford at the last minute. That drew the ire of Swinney, who used his press conference on Friday to call out Pete Golding by name and detail Ole Miss' operation to tamper with Ferrelli after he signed, calling and texting him during classes and offering a two-year, $2 million contract to get him to leave Clemson for Ole Miss. Swinney, reading from a prepared statement with dates and times of various communication, laid out the timeline of events that saw Ferrelli go from committing Jan. 6 to signing on Jan. 7. Clemson has not specified whether what Ferrelli signed was a financial aid agreement or a rev-share contract, the likes of which have given more schools leverage this cycle (in the case of Demond Williams Jr. and Washington) or, for Duke and Darian Mensah, at least provide the school a grounds to claw some money back via lawsuit, if they choose to pursue that route, which can be publicly messy. After enrolling at Clemson on Jan. 11, Ferrelli again entered the portal on Jan. 16 to leave for Ole Miss. Ferrelli was the ACC Defensive Rookie of the Year in 2025, leading all first-year players in solo tackles (87). \nPer Swinney, Ferrelli's agent, Ryan Williams, alerted Clemson to the fact that Ole Miss was continuing to contact Ferrelli. Swinney then had Clemson GM Jordan Sorrells reach out to Ole Miss' GM Austin Thomas to warn them that they'd turn Ole Miss in if communication didn't stop. Per Swinney, Thomas said he wasn't involved but that Golding played by his own rules. \"The GM assured Jordan that he had communicated to the agent that he wanted no part of this and that his relationship with Jordan was more important to him than Luke Ferrelli, but that 'Pete Golding just does what he does,'\" Swinney said. After that conversation, Sorrells met with Ferrelli and learned that Golding had texted Ferrelli to ask about the buyout from his Clemson deal and offer him a $1 million contract -- and that he'd enlisted some Ole Miss stars to call Ferrelli to steer him to Oxford. \n\"Sorrells met with Luke face-to-face in his office and Luke communicated to Jordan and Ben Boulware that Pete texted him on Wednesday morning -- the head coach at Ole Miss -- when he was in his 8 a.m. class,\" Swinney said. \"And he said the text message said, 'I know you're signed. What's the buyout?' And Luke said that coach Golding also text him a picture of a $1 million contract. Luke also mentioned to Jordan and to Ben that coach Golding had Trinidad Chambliss call him from his phone and that coach Golding was there continuing to talk on his phone to push him to re-enter the transfer portal. He also said that Jaxson Dart had reached out and called him. But Luke again assured Jordan that he had no intention of leaving.\"On Friday Jan. 16, Swinney says Ferrelli's agent (Williams) again reached out to Sorrells to let him know Ole Miss had upped their offer to two years, $2 million. Sorrells asked for the text messages so Clemson could have some evidence to turn in, which Williams refused unless Clemson added a second year and another $1 million to the offer, which Clemson refused. Williams works for the agency Athletes First and, in addition to Ferrelli and other college players, reps high-profile NFL players such as Tua Tagovailoa and Brandon Aiyuk. Ultimately, Ferrelli re-entered the portal and left Clemson for Ole Miss despite a late push from Sorrells and Clemson defensive coordinator Tom Allen, who tried to meet with him at his apartment. Swinney said Clemson turned everything into the NCAA regarding what they believe to be a tampering violation by Ole Miss, noting \"there's tampering, and then there's blatant tampering.\" \"It's total hypocrisy, because all this is going on while they on the other side are trying to fight their defensive end from going in the portal. They have accused publicly others of tampering with their roster and their players, while they are over here tampering,\" Swinney said. \"This is just a really sad state of affairs and it's, to me, we have a broken system. If there are no consequences for tampering, then we have no rules and we have no governance. This is not about a linebacker at Clemson. I feel sorry for the young man, to be honest with you. I blame the adults. If you want to have adult world, there needs to be adult consequences.\" This is far from the first time this type of thing has happened, but rarely do coaches call out another by name for it -- largely because most of them are doing the same thing somewhere else. Swinney, as one of the longest holdouts in using the portal at all, is one of the rare ones who earnestly believes in doing things by the book, and as such he's one of the few that would even consider going this hard after another coach. \nThe situation will be a fascinating test case for whether the NCAA has any teeth left in terms of its ability to enforce rules against tampering. If tampering is proven, the belief is that may amount to it a Level II infraction, i.e. a significant breach of conduct, in the NCAA's eyes. For Ole Miss that could mean penalties such as fines, recruiting restrictions and probation. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NFL hiring cycle is as robust as it's been in recent memory. In all, 10 openings popped up across the league this go-around, meaning over 30% of franchises were looking for new head coaches.When we look at the array of openings, they are quite different. On the one hand, teams like the Browns, Giants, Raiders, Titans and Cardinals all fired their head coaches -- some midseason -- after years that left them with some of the league's worst records and in the top 10 of the 2026 NFL Draft. Then, there are clubs like the Bills, Ravens and Steelers that moved on from their head coaches after their tenures -- which were considered successful overall -- ran stale and failed to meet expectations.Now, each of those teams will have new faces leading their organizations into what they all hope will be a brighter tomorrow. With five coaching positions filled, let's begin rolling out our grades for each hire.Teams yet to hire a head coach: Buffalo Bills, Pittsburgh Steelers, Cleveland Browns, Arizona Cardinals and Las Vegas Raiders\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Kevin Stefanski: B+The new brain trust in Atlanta, headlined by president of football Matt Ryan and head coach Kevin Stefanski, is quite powerful.With Stefanski, he found himself in a quarterback tornado as head coach of the Browns, particularly over the last few seasons -- beginning with the arrival of Deshaun Watson and double-dipping in last year's draft with Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders.Even with that instability under center, Stefanski was still able to win two NFL Coach of the Year awards (2020 and 2023), so he comes to the Falcons with a strong reputation.\nSimilar to the Browns, however, Stefanski's tenure could be defined by how he develops the quarterback position, particularly with Michael Penix Jr. Unlike Cleveland, Stefanski will now have a plethora of weapons at his disposal to help Penix, most notably Bijan Robinson and Drake London. He also has Kirk Cousins currently in the fold as a veteran backup option. Stefanski was the offensive coordinator for the Vikings in 2019, when Cousins earned a Pro Bowl nod after posting a career-high 107.4 passer rating.From an offensive standpoint, this is a strong attempt by the Falcons brass to maximize what they have in Penix. It was also a savvy move to retain defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich as well.\n\n        \n            \n                Falcons hire Kevin Stefanski: Former Browns coach takes over in Atlanta in Matt Ryan's first major move\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Jesse Minter: AWhile some may have expected Baltimore to go with an offensive-minded head coach to pair with Lamar Jackson, I believe hiring Minter is the better approach.One of the biggest obstacles in the Ravens' pursuit of a Super Bowl berth has been their defense falling short, despite having elite talent like Kyle Hamilton and Roquan Smith. Injuries played a major role, but the unit also simply didn't perform to its level.Minter should help fix that, as his Chargers defense ranked top five in the NFL in several key categories this season as defensive coordinator.\nChargers defense in 2025StatsNFL rankTotal YPG285.25thPassing YPG179.95thTD-INT ratio16-191stINT19T-3rdPasser rating75.01stOf course, Minter also has ties to the organization, having worked as a defensive assistant under John Harbaugh from 2017 to 2020. From there, he rose through the ranks largely under Jim Harbaugh — first as his defensive coordinator at Michigan and then with the Chargers.The biggest X-factor will be who Minter brings in as offensive coordinator, but he comes from a strong coaching tree and should be able to find the right conductor for Baltimore's high-octane offense.\n        \n            \n                Ravens hiring Jesse Minter: Chargers defensive coordinator set to replace coach John Harbaugh in Baltimore\n                \n                    Bryan DeArdo                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Jeff Hafley: C+When Miami hired former Packers vice president of player personnel Jon-Eric Sullivan as its next general manager, the writing was on the wall that the Dolphins would keep that Green Bay pipeline flowing with the hiring of Jeff Hafley.This move leans into what made Miami feisty down the stretch, as it went 6-4 over its final 10 games thanks in part to improved defensive play. The Dolphins allowed 21.9 points per game over that span after surrendering 29.3 points per game in the seven games prior. With Hafley's bread and butter on defense, that unit should remain a strength in 2026.Under Hafley, Green Bay allowed 20.5 points per game, 5.1 yards per play and 108.5 rushing yards per game over the last two seasons -- all top-10 marks in the NFL. Hafley's group did stumble a bit down the stretch of the 2025 campaign, however.The bigger concern as Hafley ascends to head coach, despite his experience at the college level (he led Boston College from 2020 to 2023), comes on the offensive side of the ball. Miami appears poised to part ways with Tua Tagovailoa this offseason, and given the team's cap constraints, there's no clear path to a suitable replacement.With Hafley not coming from an offensive background, he may not be able to mask those deficiencies as effectively as a coach with more experience on that side of the ball. That could result in a lean 2026 for the franchise.\n        \n            \n                Tua Tagovailoa benched by Dolphins: Why numbers don't add up now to jettison Miami QB\n                \n                    Joel Corry                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    John Harbaugh: AThis is a great marriage between the Giants and Harbaugh.From New York's perspective, the team needed to bring in a head coach with immediate credibility, particularly after three of its previous four hires were first-time head coaches. The Giants were searching for a Tom Coughlin-like figure who can stabilize the organization, and Harbaugh is certainly capable of that.Harbaugh is also the first head coach the Giants have hired who has previously won a Super Bowl, so he brings a winning pedigree that no recent coach has carried into the building.Giants during/post Tom Coughlin eraDuringSinceSpan2004-152016-25W-L102-9055-109-1Rank15th31stFrom Harbaugh's standpoint, this was the top job on the market when he accepted the gig (Buffalo had not opened up yet). New York already has a franchise quarterback in Jaxson Dart, intriguing skill-position weapons in Malik Nabers and Cam Skattebo, and a defensive line stocked with stud pass rushers like Brian Burns, Dexter Lawrence and Abdul Carter.The Giants also hold the fifth overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, creating even more avenues to add blue-chip talent. It wouldn't be surprising to see a Harbaugh-led rebound in 2026.\n        \n            \n                John Harbaugh's first 100 days: The blueprint to rebuild the Giants\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Robert Saleh: BThere's an argument to be made that the Titans should have opted for an offensive-minded head coach to pair with rising second-year quarterback Cam Ward. After all, the franchise finished 30th in points per game (16.7) and 31st in total yards per game (259.6) during the 2025 season.That said, Saleh is worthy of a second stint as a head coach. While his offenses with the Jets never fully panned out, he did have New York's defense playing at a high level. If he's able to provide a similar boost in Tennessee, that would be a welcome development, particularly after the Titans have given up 27.6 points per game over the last two seasons (31st in the NFL over that span).Saleh was saddled with Zach Wilson to begin his tenure with the Jets, and after that pick flamed out, the team pivoted to Aaron Rodgers, who tore his Achilles just a handful of plays into his first season. That prevented Saleh from ever truly getting off the ground in New York, but he won't have that same problem in Tennessee, particularly if Ward carries over his second-half leap into Year 2.Cam WardFirst 10 gamesLast 7 gamesTeam PPG14.320.1Completion percentage58.4%62.0%Total TD-TO6-1211-2Passer rating73.890.5With his quarterback secure, Saleh will need to hire the right offensive coordinator, but the head coach is positioned to succeed. Beyond already having Ward in place, Saleh inherits a Titans team holding the No. 4 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft and the most available cap space in the NFL, with a projected $100.7 million. That's an awfully strong starting point.\n        \n            \n                Robert Saleh rightfully gets a second chance with the Titans, but his OC hire will determine success\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n            ",

    "body": "\n        This offseason's coaching carousel is one of the wildest in recent memory.Not only did two head-coaching jobs open during the season, but EIGHT more have become available since the end of the regular season, including two from teams that made the playoffs. The 10 total available head-coaching jobs -- Giants, Falcons, Cardinals, Bills, Dolphins, Browns, Ravens, Steelers, Titans and Raiders -- tie the record for most in a given offseason. One job that remains open belongs to a teams with a past regular-season MVP, and one belongs to a franchise with arguably the most job stability in league history. There were -- and still are -- plenty of coordinator openings on both sides of the ball, and more could open depending on what happens with the remaining head-coaching slots.With that in mind, it's important to take stock of what has happened to date during the hiring cycle. We compiled a quick list of early winners and losers and will keep it updated as more openings get filled.Winner: New York GiantsThe Giants acted quickly and aggressively to land the top available coach of this hiring cycle, finalizing a five-year deal with former Baltimore Ravens head coach John Harbaugh before he could take planned meetings with the Tennessee Titans and Atlanta Falcons. \nAs we wrote last week, Harbaugh should bring immediate stability and competence to a Giants organization that has desperately needed both for at least the past decade, cycling through coach after coach and disappointment after disappointment. Harbaugh should also bring over a strong staff of assistant coaches, and the Giants will be better for having hired him.\n        \n            \n                John Harbaugh's first 100 days: The blueprint to rebuild the Giants\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLoser: Buffalo BillsThe Bills' decision to fire Sean McDermott in the wake of their divisional-round loss to the Denver Broncos is somewhat understandable. It has been nine years of the McDermott era and seven of McDermott and Josh Allen, and they have yet to achieve their Super Bowl goals. McDermott might not have been the issue standing in Buffalo's way, but teams can only make changes in so many ways, and swapping out the coach is one of them.The Bills land here less because of the firing itself and more because they elevated Brandon Beane to an even more powerful role despite his presiding over a roster that has backslid over the past several years, then followed it with a disastrous press conference from Beane and owner Terry Pegula explaining both the firing and the promotion. \nAdd in the fact that this is not an ideal hiring cycle in which to search for McDermott's replacement, and the Bills land here with relative ease.\n        \n            \n                Bills owner Terry Pegula throws Keon Coleman under the bus, claims coaching staff pushed to pick wide receiver\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWinner (and loser): Los Angeles ChargersWhatever one thinks of Mike McDaniel's head-coaching bona fides, there is no arguing that he can dial up an offense. He is one of the best in the NFL at putting players in position to succeed, specifically by getting playmakers the ball in space so they can make things happen after the catch. He also excels at designing a run game. The Chargers have struggled to run the ball for a while, and McDaniel should be able to alleviate that. McDaniel has done all of this over the past few years with a quarterback -- Tua Tagovailoa -- who has clear limitations, yet McDaniel schemed around them. Expected to be hired as the Chargers' offensive coordinator, McDaniel can build an offense around a quarterback with significantly more physical talent. The marriage between McDaniel and head coach Jim Harbaugh may be an odd one personality-wise, but from a football-fit standpoint, it's hard to believe the Chargers could have done a better job finding their next OC.\nThe Chargers are also a loser this cycle, though, because they will no longer have defensive coordinator Jesse Minter, who will become the next coach of the Baltimore Ravens. (See below.)Loser: Cleveland Browns (so far)Cleveland is still in its second round of interviews, with coaches such as Todd Monken and Jim Schwartz already getting their turns and others like Jesse Minter, Grant Udinski and Nate Scheelhaase reportedly in the mix. There is still a chance the Browns can land the plane here, and this designation could change if they make a home-run hire. (We'll switch them from loser to winner if and when they do.) For now, though, they belong here. Cleveland fired Kevin Stefanski, and he immediately landed another -- and probably more desirable -- job as the head coach of the Atlanta Falcons. The aforementioned McDaniel pulled his name out of consideration for the Browns' top job before deciding to become an offensive coordinator instead. Meanwhile, more jobs keep opening and pushing this one further down the pecking order.\nWinner: Tennessee Titans (kind of)The Titans hired former San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator and New York Jets head coach Robert Saleh as their next coach. Perhaps just as importantly, they did not hire now two-time former Kansas City Chiefs offensive coordinator Matt Nagy, which had been heavily rumored before the Saleh news broke, given the connection between Nagy and Titans general manager Mike Borgonzi from their time in Kansas City. Nagy showed little propensity for putting players in position to succeed during his tenure as head coach of the Chicago Bears, and the Chiefs' offense backslid significantly upon his return to his previous role, so it never made much sense that he was considered the favorite to land this job.Saleh's time in New York did not go particularly well, but that stemmed almost entirely from the revolving-door situation at quarterback. His defense ranked as the best in the league during that stretch. If the Titans are right about Cam Ward, things could be different this time around.\n\n        \n            \n                Robert Saleh rightfully gets a second chance with the Titans, but his OC hire will determine success\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLoser: Miami DolphinsThe Dolphins fired McDaniel, and he immediately became the top candidate for nearly every offensive coordinator opening while also interviewing for multiple head-coaching jobs. In the wake of his firing, the rumor mill kicked into high gear that Miami wanted to pursue Harbaugh, but he showed more interest in other opportunities.The Dolphins ultimately hired the Green Bay Packers tandem of Jon-Eric Sullivan and Jeff Hafley as their general manager and head coach, respectively. Hafley went 22-26 in four seasons as the head coach at Boston College before becoming Green Bay's defensive coordinator, where his defenses played very well early in the season before slipping down the stretch. He is a well-respected defensive mind, but it's fair to question whether this was the most inspiring hire in the grand scheme of things.Winner: Baltimore RavensBaltimore moved on from Harbaugh to kick off its offseason, but rebounded from that by making what seems like the most sensible hire the Ravens could have made in Jesse Minter. Minter was with the Ravens as as a defensive assistant and then defensive backs coach for four years (2017 through 2020) before moving to the college ranks at Vanderbilt and then Michigan, where he worked as Jim Harbaugh's defensive coordinator before making the jump to the NFL and handling the same role with the Chargers. \nHis defense over the last couple of seasons has been very good, and he's shown that he's able to build quality units despite not having elite talent. At the very least, he should get the Ravens closer to playing the kind of defense they did under Mike Macdonald. A lot will obviously depend on his offensive coordinator hire -- and there are already rumors of Kliff Kingsbury -- but this hire itself is a good one.Winner: Dallas CowboysDallas moved on from former defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus, whose unit was arguably the worst in the league this season. Eberflus was thrust upon head coach Brian Schottenheimer by the Jones family, and while he was dealt a bad hand with the trade of Micah Parsons just before the start of the season, he also played that hand badly and things were a disaster on that side of the ball to the point that a change had to be made after just one year. The Cowboys landed on former Eagles defensive backs coach and passing game coordinator Christian Parker as his replacement, and it's an inspired move in a similar way that landing former Cardinals offensive line coach Klayton Adams as their offensive coordinator was last year. Parker is a Vic Fangio disciple who is very highly respected and who quickly built one of the best secondaries in the league with Philadelphia.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Conference championship Sunday is nearly upon us. We're now just two days away from finding out what the Super Bowl LX matchup will be to close the 2025 season. After 272 regular-season games and 10 playoff contests, only three games remain before we crown an NFL champion. With a trip to Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara on the line, health -- as it always does in football -- will play a massive role in determining the outcomes of both the AFC Championship Game between the second-seeded New England Patriots and the top-seeded Denver Broncos and the NFC Championship Game between the fifth-seeded Los Angeles Rams and the top-seeded Seattle Seahawks.It's already known that the Broncos will be without starting quarterback Bo Nix after he broke a bone in his ankle during their divisional-round victory over the Buffalo Bills, and that the Seahawks will be without running back Zach Charbonnet after he tore his ACL in a divisional-round blowout over the San Francisco 49ers.Now that the final injury reports have been released for each of the NFL's final four teams, here's who is ruled out and who still has a chance to play Sunday.New England Patriots (-4.5) at Denver BroncosSunday, 3 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nTEAMPLAYERPOSITIONINJURYSTATUSPatriotsHarold Landry IIILBKneeOutMarte MapuLBHipQuestionableCarlton Davis IIICBConcussion protocolQuestionableMack HollinsWRAbdomenQuestionableBroncosBo NixQBAnkleOutJ.K. DobbinsRBFootOutDrew SandersLBAnkleOutLucas KrullTEFootOutLuke WattenbergCShoulderQuestionableAlex ForsythCAnkleQuestionableTroy FranklinWRHamstringQuestionableJL SkinnerSQuadQuestionableThe Patriots suffered a major blow Friday when the team ruled out 2025 sacks leader Harold Landry III (knee). Landry, who posted a team-high 8.5 sacks during the regular season, didn't practice all week, leading to him not suiting up in Denver on Sunday. Starting outside cornerback Carlton Davis III (concussion protocol) is questionable after being a limited participant Wednesday and Thursday before practicing fully Friday. Linebacker Marte Mapu (hip) is also questionable after missing practice Wednesday and Thursday and then being limited Friday.The Broncos are, of course, without quarterback Bo Nix (ankle), who is done for the season. Running back J.K. Dobbins (foot), who has been out since Week 10, practiced as a limited participant all week, but the Broncos decided he wasn't ready to return. Starting center Luke Wattenberg (shoulder) appears poised to play Sunday after practicing fully all week and is listed as questionable. Center Alex Forsyth (ankle), his fill-in, was limited all week and is also questionable. Wide receiver Troy Franklin (hamstring) was limited throughout the week as well, leaving him questionable, too.\nLos Angeles Rams at Seattle Seahawks (-2.5)Sunday, 6:30 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)TEAMPLAYERPOSITIONINJURYSTATUSRamsRob HavensteinOTAnkleOutByron YoungLBKneeQuestionableSeahawksChazz SurrattLBAnkleOutAmari KightOTKneeDoubtfulJosh JonesOLKnee/AnkleQuestionableRobbie OuztsFBNeckQuestionableThe Rams ruled out just one player, offensive tackle Rob Havenstein (ankle), after he was a limited practice participant Thursday and Friday. The only player listed as questionable for the Rams is edge rusher Byron Young (knee). He didn't practice Wednesday or Thursday but was limited Friday. That's a significant question mark given the Pro Bowl pass rusher led Los Angeles with 12.0 sacks during the regular season.\nLast week, Seahawks Pro Bowl quarterback Sam Darnold was listed as questionable for the divisional round with an oblique injury, but he ended up starting and throwing for 124 yards and a touchdown on 12 of 17 passing. For the NFC Championship Game this week, Darnold is off the final injury report and carries no game status, meaning he's good to go. Seattle did rule out linebacker Chazz Surratt (ankle) despite him practicing fully all week. Offensive tackle Amari Kight (knee) is doubtful, and swing lineman Josh Jones (knee/ankle) is questionable.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The best player in the world has made his presence felt in his first tournament of the season as Scottie Scheffler backed up his Thursday 63 with a Friday 64 to post a leading line of 17 entering the weekend at the 2026 American Express. Scheffler is bogey-free through two rounds at the American Express, as he has torched La Quinta Country Club and the Nicklaus Tournament Course, taking advantage of ideal desert conditions.The lack of wind has given the three-course rotation for this tournament little defense against the best players in the world, and no one has attacked them better than Scheffler. \nThe No. 1 golfer in the world will now move over to the Stadium Course at PGA West, which presents a bigger challenge than the other two courses across the final 36 holes. Scheffler is excited about playing a course that rewards great play and punishes mistakes. \"That golf course is a lot tougher than these other two, ball-striking-wise. You've got to get the ball in play,\" Scheffler said. \"You can shoot a low number out there, but you've gotta really be getting the ball in play. It can punish you pretty quick. There's a lot of water on the golf course. I think it's a really good challenge. I think it's a great course in terms of, when you're hitting it well and you're putting the ball in position, you can shoot a really low number. And if not, you're gonna get punished pretty severely for it.\" \nJoining Scheffler at the top of the leaderboard is 18-year-old Blades Brown, who played his sixth consecutive competitive round of golf on Friday after participating in a Korn Ferry Tour event located in the Bahamas from Sunday to Wednesday. Brown also played the Nicklaus Tournament Course on Friday and came out of the gates firing, going 8 under through his first seven holes (starting on the back nine) to firmly put himself on 59 watch. Brown got to 12 under through 15 holes, meaning he needed just one birdie on the final three holes to post the 16th round of 59 or better in PGA Tour history. Brown couldn't capitalize on the par-5 7th or a terrific tee shot on the par-3 8th, leaving himself needing a birdie on No. 9 -- his 18th -- to shoot a 59. After bombing a drive, he had just a gap wedge left for his approach and stuffed it within 5 feet to set up a short birdie putt. \nUnfortunately for Brown, he pushed his birdie putt off the right edge and finished par-par-par to shoot 60 and post a course record on the Nicklaus Tournament Course. \"Absolutely ... of course I did, yeah,\" Brown said with a laugh when asked if he felt added pressure on the last three holes. \"I just stuck to my game plan. I said I'm going to execute shots that I can control, and unfortunately, I wasn't able to get the job done this time. But I am so stoked to have shot 60 on the PGA Tour.\"Over at La Quinta Country Club, Andrew Putnam matched Brown with a 12-under 60 to tie the course record, but he likewise couldn't make a birdie on his final hole to shoot 59. Putnam's 60 came after a lackluster 72 on Thursday, moving him up 114 spots into the top 20 of the leaderboard.\nBrown's 60 vaulted him 50 spots and into a share of the lead with Scheffler heading into the weekend. Like Scheffler, he'll play his third round on the tougher Stadium Course before the 54-hole cut gets made and everyone finishes on Pete Dye's test in the desert. LeadersT1. Scottie Scheffler, Blades Brown (-17): With a 54-hole cut, we won't see repairings until Sunday, which means Scheffler and Brown won't play together on Moving Day. Perhaps that could help young Brown, who will get at least an extra day without the added stress and pressure of going toe-to-toe with the game's best golfer. It'll be hard to follow up his Friday 60, but he's in line for the best finish of his young career after making three cuts in eight starts in 2025 but failing to notch a top 25 finish. Scheffler, meanwhile, is looking to do something he's never done in his illustrious career to this point: win in one of his first five events of the season. If anyone is built to continue going low at the Stadium Course, it's Scheffler, and he'll have his eyes on a wire-to-wire victory to open his 2026 campaign. \nContenders3. Si Woo Kim (-16)T4. S.H. Kim, Matt McCarty (-15)T6. Eric Cole, Rickie Fowler, Nico Echavarria, Wyndham Clark, Jacob Bridgeman, Nick Taylor (-14)T12. Russell Henley, Patrick Cantlay, Ben Griffin and three others (-13) While Kim did not post a 60, his 7-under effort on the Stadium Course was wildly impressive to keep pace with Scheffler before he gets a crack at La Quinta Country Club on Saturday. Clark's 64 at the Stadium Course was the low round of the day there, as he climbed into the top 10 and will likewise move to La Quinta CC to try and make up more ground in the third round. Beyond those two, multiple heavy-hitters are lurking in the top 20 with Fowler, Griffin, Henley and Cantlay all plodding along nicely to give themselves a look going into the weekend. \nIf the wind stays light all weekend, there will be more scores in the low 60s, and players will have plenty of opportunities to make big moves up the leaderboard. The challenge for all of them is the name at the top as Scheffler gets to enjoy those conditions like the rest, and he's a hard man to catch. With just about any other player in the lead, this would still feel like a wide-open tournament given what's possible on these courses, but Scheffler's presence makes it far more unlikely he creates a big opening for those well back in the pack. That said, we saw that a 59 could be in the cards this week, and for those who still have a crack at La Quinta CC or the Nicklaus Tournament Course on Saturday, they'll have visions of a similar move to what we saw from Brown and Putnam on Friday. Finishing in styleTony Finau hasn't had the scoring gear needed to contend so far this week, but he gave himself a boost going into the weekend with his approach on his final hole on Friday, holing out from the fairway with a wedge for eagle on No. 9 on the Nicklaus Tournament Course.\nThat moved him to 8 under for the tournament and into T61 going into Saturday. With the cut still to be settled, Finau's eagle to close out his second round could prove very important to his chances of getting a Sunday tee time. 2026 American Express updated odds, picksOdds via DraftKings SportsbookScottie Scheffler (+134)Si Woo Kim (+410)Ben Griffin (+1450)Wyndham Clark (+1650)Patrick Cantlay (+1850)Blades Brown (+1950)Jacob Bridgeman (+2100)With scoring this good and a leaderboard this crowded, you want to take a few swings at some longer shots -- especially those who get another round not on the Stadium Course. At the same time, with Scheffler in first, you probably don't want to get overly aggressive in adding positions outside of Scottie. Clark is particularly interesting given he gets La Quinta CC and appears to be in much better form to start 2026 than we saw from him in 2025. He's a guy that can go low and his low round of the week so far is on the Stadium Course, which means he should have plenty of confidence on Sunday if he gets into a position to contend. I also wouldn't hate a nibble at Sam Burns further down the board at 92-1. He's just five shots back and has been known to get red-hot with the putter and post some really low scores. \n            ",

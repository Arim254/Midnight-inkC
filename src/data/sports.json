    "body": "\n        A cross-conference NFL Week 14 matchup has the Los Angeles Chargers hosting the Philadelphia Eagles on 'Monday Night Football' at 8:15 p.m. ET. A MNF SGP could consist of NFL picks on the money line, and the Chargers have won five of their last six home games versus the Eagles. Philadelphia is a 2.5-point favorite and the over/under is 41.5, per the latest Eagles vs. Chargers odds, with spread and total picks also being popular bets to include in NFL same-game parlays. Many will also go the route of including prop picks, with the likes of Jalen Hurts, Saquon Barkley, Keenan Allen and Ladd McConkey top players to target, especially with the questionable tag on Justin Herbert (hand) and Omarion Hampton (ankle).Hurts and Barkley have similar NFL prop odds as an anytime touchdown scorer with Barkley at +105 and Hurts at +110. Neither found the end zone last week, however, while Hampton (+190), who was activated from the IR on Monday, has the shortest odds to score amongst Chargers. Adding a plus-money NFL prop like this could result in a huge payday on your MNF same-game parlay.

Brown goes Under 61.5 receiving yards (-112). With Philly's offensive struggles, Brown is having the worst season of his career as his 63.5 receiving yards per game are the lowest of his seven NFL seasons. While he's found success against poor teams, that hasn't been the case against the league's better squads. Brown hasn't even reached 50 receiving yards in four of his last five versus teams that currently have winning records.The 8-4 Chargers fit the bill, and they will be the best pass defense that the Eagles have seen all year. L.A. ranks second versus the pass as it is built to prevent big days from wide receivers. Only one wideout has had more than 46 receiving yards versus the Chargers over the last four games. Brown is projected to have 52.2 receiving yards on average, as this NFL prop rated 4.5 stars could be a part of a winning 'Monday Night Football' SGP. See which other MNF same-game parlay picks to make here, and bet this prop here:How to make Eagles vs. Chargers SGP picksIn addition, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model has two other NFL props that are rated 4.5 stars or better that could be a part of your Chargers vs. Eagles SGP picks. You can only see the Machine Learning Model's Monday Night Football NFL parlay at SportsLine.What are the model's top same-game parlay picks you should target with your Eagles vs. Chargers predictions?

Hurts is running more as of late, with 30+ yards rushing in three straight, and his eight scores on the ground rank seventh in the NFL. Hurts' running could be a weapon versus L.A. as just two teams have allowed more rushing TDs to opposing quarterbacks. See who else to roster at SportsLine.McClure is also rostering Chargers receiver Ladd McConkey, who has been one of the most productive wideouts after a slow start. Since Week 5, McConkey ranks 11th amongst wide receivers in Fantasy points.

The Buccaneers have signed defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul to their practice squad following a workout with team, according to Ian Rapoport.The 36-year-old Pierre-Paul hasn't played in the NFL since Dec. 11, 2023, when he was a member of the Miami Dolphins. The Dolphins waved Pierre-Paul shortly after that game.Pierre-Paul does have experience in Tampa, spending four seasons there 2018-21. As a member of the Bucs, Pierre-Paul won Super Bowl LV and recorded two sacks in the NFC Championship Game against the Green Bay Packers. In his first stint with Tampa Bay, Pierre-Paul totaled 131 tackles, 35 tackles for loss and 33 sacks.\nFollowing the 2021 season, Pierre-Paul spent one year with the Baltimore Ravens in 2022 before splitting time with the New Orleans Saints and Dolphins in 2023.Prior to joining the Bucs, Pierre-Paul was a star for the New York Giants from 2010-17. In that time, Pierre-Paul earned first-team All-Pro honors and was named to the Pro Bowl roster twice. In 2011, Pierre-Paul and the rest of the defensive line powered the Giants to a Super Bowl LXVI win over the New England Patriots.\nIn his 14-year NFL career, Pierre-Paul has amassed 631 tackles, 127 tackles for loss and 94.5 sacks.\n            \n    ",

Chimaev told ESPN that he will make one defense of his championship before jumping to light heavyweight in pursuit of a championship in a second division.Chimaev won the middleweight championship at UFC 319, using his dominant wrestling and smothering top game to easily dispatch of Dricus Du Plessis. Challenging fights have been few and far between for Chimaev, who exploded onto the scene with two wins in 10 days at \"Fight Island\" in July 2020.Chimaev bounced between welterweight and middleweight until settling in at 185 pounds, where he defeated former welterweight champion Kamaru Usman and former middleweight champ Robert Whittaker before his championship-grabbing performance against Du Plessis.\"These [middleweight] fights don't make me excited, but I need to do my job,\" Chimaev said. \"I need to make money. If there is a big name to make more money, then I will be excited. If you get $3 million for a fight, but then you have a good [opponent], and you make $6 million, of course you'll be excited.\"\nRather than return to welterweight in pursuit of a second belt, Chimaev said that a move to light heavyweight would follow his first middleweight title defense, with designs on a bout with two-time -- and current -- 205-pound champion Alex Pereira.\"That's a good fight for me,\" Chimaev said of facing Pereira. \"Everyone knows that. The UFC knows that. The UFC doesn't want to give me this guy. And this guy said, 'Oh, I'll come to you and [have a grappling match].' Grappling is not our job. UFC is our job. He said he could fight Du Plessis [when Du Plessis was the champion], he accepted that fight. But now he says, 'Khamzat is not a good fight for me.'\"\nPereira comes from a kickboxing background, and while he has developed decent takedown defense, wrestling is still likely the weakest dimension of his game. Chimaev averages 5.29 takedowns per 15 minutes of Octagon time, making the perspective of a smaller man with tremendous wrestling against the thunderous strikes of Pereira an intriguing potential fight.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Kansas City Chiefs spent the better part of a decade treating the AFC playoff race as a formality. This year, it became a weekly math problem, and the numbers don't lie. Sunday night's 20-10 loss to the Houston Texans dropped Kansas City to 6-7, pushing the franchise into unfamiliar territory: 10th place in the AFC with four games remaining and below .500 in December for the first time since 2012. The defeat also ended the Chiefs' run of nine straight AFC West titles. Patrick Mahomes didn't hide the reality of the moment.\"We know the (playoff) chances are getting lower and lower, but I know the guys on this team are going to give everything they have, every opportunity we get,\" Mahomes said. Kansas City's night unraveled in familiar fashion. Drives stalled, chances slipped away and the Chiefs' offense never found a rhythm. Mahomes finished with just 160 passing yards on 14-of-33 throwing with three picks -- a stat line shaped as much by his own miscues as by the help he never received. The Chiefs dropped six passes, including one from Travis Kelce in the fourth quarter that deflected into the arms of Texans linebacker Azeez Al-Shaair, and another from Rashee Rice on a must-have fourth-and-4.The protection issues were just as damaging. Kansas City entered the game already patching together an offensive line with three starters unavailable, then lost tackle Wanya Morris on the first snap. On the other side of the ball, cornerback Trent McDuffie exited after suffering a knee injury following a 46-yard completion to Nico Collins. With the lineup thinning, Houston consistently collapsed the pocket, pressuring Mahomes on roughly half of his dropbacks and contributing to what became the lowest passer rating of his career.\n\"They are upset,\" Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. \"They put it all out there and it didn't work out for them. The guys that had some mishaps, they [are] upset. These guys take responsibility for things.\"Mahomes has never missed the NFL postseason.\"I know we're not winning games, but that mindset the guys have in this locker room, in the games that we're not winning, you can never question the fight of this team,\" Mahomes said. \"Obviously, we're not executing at the right moments and we're not making those plays, but at the end of the day you can never question that, and I think you'll see that for these last four weeks.\"Kansas City's path back to the playoffs is narrow, but not impossible. The Chiefs close the season with home games against AFC West rivals Denver Broncos (11-2) and Los Angeles Chargers (8-4), and road contests against struggling Tennessee Titans (2-11) and Las Vegas Raiders (2-11).\nTo keep their postseason chances alive, they will need to win out and hope the Wild Card teams ahead of them stumble.\n            ",

Jones' replacement, the rookie Riley Leonard, isn't 100% healthy either.According to ESPN, Leonard is dealing with a strained knee ligament that has him \"week to week.\" The Colts are uncertain if he will be able to start on Sunday against the Seattle Seahawks. Coach Shane Steichen told reporters Monday that Leonard is dealing with a right knee injury, but that he will \"hopefully\" be available for Week 15. How Leonard fares in practice this week should determine whether he makes his first career start.With Anthony Richardson still on injured reserve after fracturing his orbital bone, and Leonard nursing a banged-up knee, the only other quarterback the Colts have is Brett Rypien, who is on the practice squad. It's a reason why the Colts are bringing in 44-year-old Philip Rivers for a workout. Rivers was the last quarterback to lead the Colts to the playoffs, as he went 11-5 in his one season with Indy back in 2020.  As for Leonard, he completed 18 of 29 passes for 145 yards and one interception in his first extensive NFL action on Sunday, and also rushed for a touchdown. The sixth-round pick out of Notre Dame led the Fighting Irish to the College Football Playoff National Championship game last year, where they fell to the Ohio State Buckeyes. In 16 games played, he completed 66.7% of his passes for 2,861 yards, 21 touchdowns and eight interceptions. Leonard also racked up 906 yards and a whopping 17 touchdowns on the ground.\nThe Colts have one of the toughest remaining schedules in the NFL. After playing in Seattle, they host the San Francisco 49ers in Week 16 and the Jaguars in Week 17, before finishing the season in Houston against the Texans. According to SportsLine, the Colts have a 6.7% chance to win the division, and 45.7% chance to make the playoffs.\n            \n    ",

The Chargers are getting healthier here with the return of running back Omarion Hampton, but they'll have to navigate the injury to Justin Herbert. They're looking to keep pace in the AFC wild card race and stay within potential striking distance of the Denver Broncos in the AFC West.Philadelphia has lost back-to-back games to drop its record to 8-4 and looks like it is in a bad way at the moment. The coaching staff and the players are increasingly coming under fire despite the fact that the Eagles look to be in full control of the division and on their way to a playoff spot. There's a lot of angst in Philadelphia right now, and a win in this game would go a long way toward alleviating it.Will the Chargers deal the Eagles their third loss in a row, or will Philadelphia break the streak? We'll find out soon enough. But before we clue you into some key storylines for this matchup, here's a look at how you can watch the game.Where to watch Eagles vs. ChargersDate: Monday, Dec. 8 | Time: 8:15 p.m. ETLocation: SoFi Stadium (Inglewood, California)TV: ESPN/ABC | Stream: Fubo (Try for free) Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Eagles -1.5, O/U 41.5 via DraftKings SportsbookLIVE updates: Follow along with all the action as the Eagles battle the Chargers on \"Monday Night Football.\"\nKey storylinesJustin Herbert's injury. Herbert broke a bone in his hand last week against the Raiders. He briefly left the game and was replaced by Trey Lance, but he later returned wearing a padded glove. He had surgery on the hand last week and was limited in practices throughout the week. It'll be interesting to see how he handles snaps from under center, or whether the Chargers go exclusively shotgun throughout the game to protect his hand. How he handles the Eagles pass rush is also worth monitoring, given that he probably doesn't want to take very many hits and risk injuring the hand any further. Eagles offensive struggles. Philadelphia has not scored more than 21 points since its Week 9 bye. The Eagles have struggled to run the ball and they have struggled to throw the ball with any degree of consistency, and they've also turned the ball over five times in their four post-bye games. The Chargers have an excellent defense that is fresh off holding the Raiders to an anemic 156 total yards and 31 rushing yards, so it could be some tough sledding if the Eagles can't get back to doing the things they used to do well. Nick Sirianni reportedly had a greater hand in the offensive game plan this week, so we'll see how he and OC Kevin Patullo decide to attack L.A.'s defense.Omarion Hampton's return. Hampton has been out since Week 5, when he suffered a fracture in his ankle. He was off to a terrific start to his rookie season before going down, but he's also been out for more than two full months. He's expected to split carries with Kimani Vidal in some form or fashion, but we don't yet know how that split will look. Vidal had some really good games in Hampton's absence, but was also somewhat inconsistent, seemingly going off every other week. Still, he should provide a nice one-two punch with Hampton and keep the latter fresh as he works his way back into the lineup.Playoff picture. The Chargers are currently 8-4 and in sixth place in the AFC. They're a half-game behind the Bills for the No. 5 seed. With a win, they would jump ahead of Buffalo and take over that fifth slot. With a loss, they'd drop to 8-5 and move behind the Colts and Texans, out of the field entirely. Philadelphia is also 8-4 and owns the No. 3 seed in the NFC thanks to its control of the NFC East. The Eagles can't move up or drop down in the NFC standings based on the result of this game, but they could extend their division lead over the Cowboys and keep pace with the 9-3-1 Packers for the No. 2 seed if they come away with a win. Bet Chargers vs. Eagles at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if their first bet of at least $5 wins.Chargers vs. Eagles prediction, pick\nThe Justin Herbert hand surgery has me off the Chargers in this game. Even if they get Omarion Hampton back, I don't know how effective we can expect the offense to be -- even against a defense that has struggled the last two weeks. We know the type of ceiling Vic Fangio's unit can reach. Do I trust the Eagles' offense at all here? Nope. But I'll back the team whose quarterback at least is not injured. \nPick: Eagles 21, Chargers 17 | (Philadelphia -1.5, Under 41.5)\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

He consented to a breathalyzer test which then showed a .178 blood alcohol content (BAC), more than twice the legal limit of .08. He received citations for DUI and failure to drive within a single lane. The Ravens re-signed him to a one-year deal the following month.Cleveland, 27, recently received probation as part of a plea deal, per Jeff Zrebiec of The Athletic.\nThe Ravens selected Cleveland in the third round (94th overall) in the 2021 NFL Draft. The Georgia product appeared in 64 games with seven starts across five seasons in Baltimore; he has been a healthy scratch each of the past three weeks. Baltimore (6-7) is on the outside looking in on the AFC playoff picture after a home loss to the Steelers in Week 14.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier appeared in federal court in New York on Monday and pleaded not guilty to two charges stemming from the FBI's investigation into sports betting and illegal gambling. Rozier, who was arrested in October along with suspended Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups, former NBA player Damon Jones and more than 30 others, is among the latest defendants to be arraigned in the case.Rozier faces federal conspiracy wire fraud and money laundering charges, and after he entered his not guilty plea, the court released him on $3 million bond. Magistrate Judge Clay Kaminsky also instructed him not to gamble, possess firearms or make contact with victims, co-defendants and witnesses in the case. Rozier surrendered his passport, as well, and was restricted to traveling between Florida, Ohio and New York.Co-defendant De'Niro Laster, a former college football player at Kentucky, Minnesota and North Carolina Central, joined Rozier in court. He also pleaded not guilty to two charges and was released on $50,000 bond.Rozier was implicated in the sports betting case for his alleged involvement in a sports betting ring that involved current and former NBA players trading inside, non-public information generally about injuries and illnesses. Rozier allegedly informed Laster ahead of a March 2023 game that he would remove himself early from the contest, and the indictment states that Laster sold that information to gamblers, who then distributed it through a betting syndicate.\nRozier, then a member of the Charlotte Hornets, played just 10 minutes in that game against the New Orleans Pelicans before he left with a foot injury. Sportsbooks received $200,000 in wagers on prop bets for Rozier's points, rebounds and assists totals.The NBA previously launched its own investigation into Rozier, but the league did not find evidence of rules violations. It placed Rozier on leave after his arrest on federal charges.The next procedural hearing for all of the defendants is set for March 4, 2026. Judge Ramon Reyes said at a previous hearing that the defendants will remain grouped together and that he intends for the trial to begin by next September.\nChauncey Billups sells Oregon home after not guilty pleaBillups, was arraigned on Nov. 24 and pleaded not guilty to charges of wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy. The Trail Blazers coach, who has been suspended since his arrest, was allegedly involved in a separate gambling scheme to Rozier's -- one in which he lured high-net worth individuals into rigged poker games tied to the mafia.While Billups was not named in the indictment for illegal sports betting, a person referred to as \"Co-Conspirator 8\" matches his description. The Hall of Famer's attorney previously described the former NBA star as a \"man of integrity\" and denied the charges.The latest development involving Billups came this week when he sold his home in Lake Oswego, Oregon. Public records show that Billups' home in the Portland suburb is pending sale as of Dec. 4. While Billups and the Trail Blazers have not officially parted ways, the sale could indicate that his time with the team is all but over.\nDamon Jones pleads not guiltyJones is implicated in both the sports betting and illegal gambling cases and pleaded not guilty on Nov. 6 to two charges. He was released on $200,000 bond and prohibited from gambling or making contact with organized crime.Jones allegedly relayed inside information on two Los Angeles Lakers games to a co-conspirator, who then used the data for betting purposes. He was also charged for luring players, along with Billups, into rigged poker games. Jones and Billups are both accused of taking a cut of the money from those games as compensation for their roles.\n            ",

Eight teams have three wins or fewer on the year. Looking forward to Week 15, Commanders at Giants is the game expected to have the greatest impact on the 2026 NFL Draft order.As a reminder, there are four teams -- Atlanta, Green Bay, Indianapolis and Jacksonville -- without a first-round pick in 2026 as a result of draft-day trades and the Micah Parsons and Sauce Gardner deals. Here is the current 2026 NFL Draft order (via Tankathon) as well as potential team needs:\n1. New York Giants (2-11)Projected needs: WR, CB, IOL, LB, OTNew York is on a Bye this week, so there were not any NFL Draft stakes on the line. 2. Las Vegas Raiders (2-11)Projected needs: CB, LB, S, DL, OTLas Vegas kept it close in the first half, but slowly bled out over the course of the evening. 3. Tennessee Titans (2-11)Projected needs: OT, IOL, WR, DL, EDGEIn a battle of top-5 overall projected teams, Tennessee emerged victorious over Cleveland with the snow falling. \n4. Cleveland Browns (3-10)Projected needs: OT, WR, QB, CB, IOLCleveland made a valiant effort at a comeback down two scores to the Titans, but poorly executed a two-point conversion. 5. New Orleans Saints (3-10)Projected needs: CB, S, DL, RB, WRTyler Shough was far from perfect as a passer, but showed a lot of toughness and determination on his two rushing touchdowns. The rookie has given New Orleans some reason for optimism. 6. Washington Commanders (3-10)Projected needs: EDGE, LB, CB, TE, WRWashington went down without as much as a whimper Sunday versus the struggling Vikings. Jayden Daniels returned to the lineup, but did not solve the team's offensive issues. \n7. New York Jets (3-10)Projected needs: QB, WR, DL, CB, TEThe Jets lost seven straight games to open the season, but have shown some life over the past five games. The team was on life support Sunday, however, as the game against Miami was never really competitive. 8. Arizona Cardinals (3-10)Projected needs: OT, IOL, LB, DL, RBThe Cardinals are limping to the finish line with Jacoby Brissett at quarterback. Arizona has a decision to make at quarterback this offseason. 9. Los Angeles Rams via Atlanta Falcons (4-9)Projected needs: CB, OT, LB, S, IOLAtlanta's first-round pick continues to climb, which only benefits the Rams. Los Angeles is looking at a situation where they could theoretically make a play for the heir apparent to Matthew Stafford while simultaneously contending for the NFC. \n10. Cincinnati Bengals (4-9)Projected needs: IOL, CB, S, TE, EDGEJoe Burrow returned from injury in hopes of keeping the team's playoff chances alive, but the dream may be dead with this week's loss to Buffalo. 11. Minnesota Vikings (5-8)Projected needs: LB, CB, S, DL, RBJ.J. McCarthy managed the game just as he had done at Michigan. He was not the driving force on offense, but he avoided the critical errors that he had been accumulating in recent weeks. Minnesota put an end to a four-game losing streak. 12. Miami Dolphins (6-7)Projected needs: CB, WR, TE, IOL, SMiami's rebound has been one of the most improbable stories of the season. The Dolphins have won five of their past six games to force their way back into the AFC Playoff picture. \n13. Baltimore Ravens (6-7)Projected needs: EDGE, DL, IOL, TE, CBThe AFC North is typically a competitive division with multiple playoff representatives. In 2025, it is trending toward only the division winner emerging.14. Kansas City Chiefs (6-7)Projected needs: DL, RB, CB, LB, TEKansas City's playoff hopes took a massive hit with their home loss to the surging Texans. 15. Dallas Cowboys (6-6-1)Projected needs: S, LB, EDGE, RB, CBDallas' three-game win streak came to an abrupt end Thursday night against a desperate Lions team. The Cowboys are exactly .500 with four games to play.\n16. Carolina Panthers (7-6)Projected needs: CB, S, IOL, WR, DLCarolina is tied atop the NFC South after the Buccaneers' loss to the Saints. The two teams play each other twice over the final four weeks.17. Detroit Lions (8-5)Projected needs: EDGE, DL, LB, CB, OTDetroit knocked off Dallas on Thursday night to keep its NFC North chances alive. \\18. New York Jets via Indianapolis Colts (8-5)Projected needs: LB, CB, EDGE, IOL, DLJacksonville took a commanding lead in the division as the Colts continue reeling from Daniel Jones' injury. The real winner is the Jets, who acquired Indianapolis' first-round pick as part of the Sauce Gardner deal. \n19. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-6)Projected needs: LB, DL, EDGE, IOL, TEThe Buccaneers continue on their downward spiral, as the team has now lost four of their past five games. The division is very much attainable with three games remaining against the Falcons and Panthers. 20. Pittsburgh Steelers (7-6)Projected needs: QB, DL, WR, CB, IOLPittsburgh has taken over sole possession of first place in the AFC North after hanging on to beat the Ravens on Sunday.21. Philadelphia Eagles (8-5)Projected needs: TE, CB, EDGE, S, IOLPhiladelphia won four games to open the season, then lost two games, then won four straight, and is now on a three-game losing streak after falling to the Chargers in overtime.\n22. Houston Texans (8-5)Projected needs: IOL, OT, TE, DL, SThe red-hot Texans traveled to Kansas City and knocked off Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs.23. Chicago Bears (9-4)Projected needs: DL, S, IOL, RB, OTChicago battled back from a two-score deficit against Green Bay, but it was too little, too late in the end. 24. Buffalo Bills (9-4)Projected needs: S, LB, EDGE, CB, WRIt was a classic Joe-Burrow vs. Josh Allen showdown Sunday in Buffalo. The Bills keep pace in the AFC East. \n25. Los Angeles Chargers (9-4)Projected needs: IOL, EDGE, CB, TE, DLThe Chargers took down the Eagles in overtime on \"Monday Night Football.\"26. San Francisco 49ers (9-4)Projected needs: OT, IOL, DL, WR, TESan Francisco rides a three-game win streak into its bye before returning in Week 15 against the Titans.27. Cleveland Browns via Jacksonville Jaguars (9-4)Projected needs: OT, WR, QB, CB, IOLCleveland is not going to get a top-half-of-the-round pick from Jacksonville. The Jaguars have a firm grip on the divisional lead; the Browns will have to wait to learn where they will be picking.28. Dallas Cowboys via Green Bay Packers (9-3-1)Projected needs: S, LB, EDGE, RB, CBGreen Bay was able to fend off Chicago not only in Sunday's game, but also the NFC North divisional race. The two teams will meet again before the end of the season. 29. Seattle Seahawks (10-3)Projected needs: CB, DL, IOL, S, WRAtlanta served as a thorn in the side of Seattle in the first half, but the Seahawks pulled away for a decisive win.30. New England Patriots (11-2)Projected needs: OT, TE, WR, LB, EDGEDrake Maye has yet to throw for 300 yards in a game, but the Patriots will carry the league's best record for at least one more week.31. Los Angeles Rams (10-3)Projected needs: CB, OT, LB, S, IOLSeattle and Los Angeles are deadlocked in the NFL's most competitive division. Three of four NFC West teams have at least nine wins.32. Denver Broncos (11-2)Projected needs: LB, TE, S, WR, OTSunday was just the third time this season in which a Broncos outcome was decided by one score or less. Yet they have the league's best record.The 2026 NFL Draft will take place from April 23-25 in Pittsburgh.

    "body": "\n        Washington Commanders tight end Zach Ertz suffered a torn ACL in Sunday's loss to the Minnesota Vikings, the team announced. Ertz exited the game in the third quarter after taking an ugly hit to the leg from Vikings defensive back Jay Ward.On the play, Ertz leapt as he tried to reel in a high throw from quarterback Marcus Mariota. As Ertz was in the air, Ward undercut him with a hit directly to his knee. The blow bent Ertz' knee backward and flipped him in midair. Trainers quickly rushed onto the field to attend to Ertz, and he had to be carted off the field.In his Monday press conference, Commanders coach Dan Quinn said Ertz has been an \"ideal teammate\" since joining the team in 2024. He also said Ertz helped build a culture of hard work and attention to detail.\"The habits, that what stuck out to me more than anything,\" Quinn said of Ertz. \"Just doing the extra and not getting bored with the details whether it was hitting the Jugs, footwork or the technique part of it. ... Those are the type of elite habits when you're putting a program together that's like, 'That's what it looks like, and I want to point that out whenever I can.' It's been significant for us.\"\nThe 35-year-old Ertz was the Commanders' second-leading receiver on the season with 50 catches for 504 yards and four touchdowns. With Ertz on a one-year contract, his NFL future is now in question.A second-round pick by the Philadelphia Eagles in 2013, Ertz established himself as one of the most productive tight ends of his era. In 13 seasons, split between the Eagles, Commanders and Arizona Cardinals, Ertz totaled 825 receptions for 8,527 yards and 57 touchdowns.As a member of the Eagles, Ertz earned Pro Bowl honors in three consecutive seasons from 2017-19. He was also a hero in Philadelphia's Super Bowl LII win over the New England Patriots with seven catches, 67 receiving yards and what proved to be the game-winning touchdown reception.\nIn 2020, injuries and the emergence of Dallas Goedert reduced Ertz's role within the Eagles' offense. Just six games into the 2021 season, the Eagles traded Ertz to the Arizona Cardinals, where he played for three seasons before signing with the Commanders in 2024.Ertz had a late-career resurgence with the Commanders last season as he caught 66 passes for 654 yards and seven touchdowns. He helped Washington reach the NFC Championship Game, where he caught 11 passes for 104 yards in a losing effort against the Eagles.The loss of Ertz is just another in a long line of devastating injuries the Commanders have dealt with in 2025. Most notably, star quarterback Jayden Daniels and No. 1 wide receiver Terry McLaurin both missed significant time. Daniels even left Sunday's game shortly before Ertz did, although Quinn said Daniels could have gone back in but was held out for precautionary reasons.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        When the final College Football Playoff rankings were announced, Notre Dame saw its postseason hopes dissolve. Alabama remained at No. 9 after getting blasted in the SEC Championship. Despite both teams being idle, Miami jumped the Irish for the No. 10 spot after weeks of being ranked behind them. It was both shocking and somewhat predictable, as there was never going to be an acceptable outcome given the way the committee handled this situation all year. Notre Dame felt bamboozled by a number of parties; the committee; the CFP's TV partner, ESPN; and the ACC. As a result, Notre Dame declined all bowl bids, a move some believe was a bit of a parting shot at ESPN, which broadcasts and operates most bowl games. Pete Bevacqua, the school's athletic director, has been making the rounds to voice Notre Dame's displeasure with the situation. He joined the Dan Patrick Show Monday where he addressed the ACC's role in the situation.\"We have no gripes about any of the schools in the ACC. But we were mystified by the actions of the conference to attack their biggest business partner in football and a member of their conference in 24 of our other sports,\" Bevacqua said. \"And I wouldn't be honest with you if I didn't say that they've certainly done permanent damage between the conference and Notre Dame.\"\n\"Just we didn't appreciate the fact that we were singled out repeatedly and compared to Miami,\" Bevacqua explained when asked to elaborate. \"Not by Miami -- Miami has every right to do that -- but it raised a lot of eyebrows here that the conference was taking shots at us.\" The relationship between Notre Dame and the ACC certainly complicated matters here, but when push came to shove, there was never a world where the ACC wouldn't back one of their actual member programs in favor of a \"business partner,\" as Bevacqua put it.ACC commissioner Jim Phillips said as much in a statement on Monday.\"The University of Notre Dame is an incredibly valued member of the ACC and there is tremendous respect and appreciation for the entire institution,\" Phillips said. \"With that said, when it comes to football, we have a responsibility to support and advocate for all 17 of our football-playing member institutions, and I stand behind our conference efforts to do just that leading up to the College Football Playoff Committee selections on Sunday.\n\"At no time was it suggested by the ACC that Notre Dame was not a worthy candidate for inclusion in the field. We are thrilled for the University of Miami while also understanding and appreciating the significant disappointment of the Notre Dame players, coaches and program.\"Notre Dame is an ACC member in most other sports. In football, they have a deal to play five games per season against ACC teams while retaining their beloved independency. They recently added a long-term scheduling agreement with Clemson to play each year from 2027-38 that raised some questions among other ACC programs about how that will impact the Irish's agreement, and it seems there is some serious tension building within their partnership. As for what the ramifications are for the \"permanent damage\" Bevacqua claims has been done by the ACC stumping for the Canes, that's not abundantly clear. Perhaps the Irish will look to solidify more scheduling deals with the ACC's biggest programs, frustrating others who could lose home games with Notre Dame that would be huge revenue drivers. \nThe biggest problem Notre Dame should have with the ACC is that they could have avoided this debacle with a better tiebreaker policy to put the highest ranked teams in the ACC title game. Miami winning the ACC would have kept Notre Dame in the field as the final at-large team, but instead the Canes watched as their old friend Manny Diaz and Duke win an ACC title before them. All of this will become a moot issue next year when Notre Dame's MOU with the Playoff kicks in and they're guaranteed a spot if they rank inside the top 12. That doesn't help the Irish this year, and in the meantime they're searching for anyone to blame other than themselves for losing their first two games against their two best opponents. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Chiefs offensive lineman Wanya Morris is out for the season due to a knee injury he suffered on Kansas City's opening play of their Week 14 \"Sunday Night Football\" loss to the Texans, ESPN is reporting. The broadcast declined to show replays, but social media clips showed Morris' left knee hyperextending at a gruesome angle.Morris was only starting because normal starting left tackle Josh Simmons is on IR after undergoing surgery to repair his dislocated and fractured left wrist suffered in Kansas City's Thanksgiving Day loss to the Cowboys. Esa Pole, an undrafted rookie out of Washington State who was only called up to the active roster after Simmons' injury, came in to take Morris' place in the eventual 20-10 loss.Chiefs offensive line injuries continueIt's yet another devastating loss up front for Kansas City, which is also without Pro Bowl right guard Trey Smith and right tackle Jawaan Taylor.Chiefs offensive lineWeek 1 vs. ChargersEnd of Week 14 vs. TexansLeft tackleJosh SimmonsEsa PoleLeft guardKingsley SuamataiaKingsley SuamataiaCenterCreed HumphreyCreed HumphreyRight guardTrey SmithMike CaliendoRight tackleJawaan TaylorJaylon MooreOverall, the Chiefs have used 17 different offensive line combinations this season. The most-used group -- the Week 1 starters -- has played 379 offensive snaps together, 14th-most of all offensive line combinations, but that group has played in just two games since Week 6.Simmons, the 32nd overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, was away from the team from Weeks 6-10 for personal reasons. Smith (ankle) got hurt in a Week 12 win over the Colts, and Taylor (triceps/ankle), like Simmons, got hurt in Week 13 against the Cowboys.What's next for Chiefs?Both Smith and Taylor were listed as doubtful ahead of the Texans game before being ruled out. Neither have been placed on injured reserve, a potentially good sign, but Simmons will miss at least another three weeks due to his placement on IR.Should Taylor be able to return soon, Kansas City could try to flip Moore back to left tackle, which is where he played during Simmons' first absence.It's been a trying season for Kansas City (6-7) for several reasons, including the rotating offensive line groups. Sunday, Patrick Mahomes threw three interceptions and took two sacks. It was Mahomes' fourth career three-interception game, and his first with three interceptions and no passing touchdowns.The Chiefs currently occupy the No. 10 seed in the AFC standings and are two games behind No. 7 Houston, who are in the final playoff spot, and No. 8 Indianapolis. The Chiefs have the head-to-head edge over the Colts but do not over the Texans.Kansas City's road doesn't get much easier, either. The Chiefs host the Chargers, whom they lost to in Week 1, in Week 15. They finish the season with the Titans, Broncos and Raiders.SportsLine currently gives Kansas City a 9% chance to make the playoffs; it has not missed the playoffs since 2014.\n            ",

Salah is not the only title-winning veteran struggling for form lately and Inter's forwards will be hopeful that the stuttering, error-addled version of Van Dijk from recent weeks takes to the field in the San Siro. At his best Liverpool's captain played with a serenity that radiated across his team mates. Now his struggles seem to be doing the same. -- James BengeMan of the match: Lautaro Martinez, Inter -- The Argentinian striker is in great form and scored three goals in his last two Serie A matches, and scored a total of 11 goals in 18 games in all competitions, including four in the Champions League. Considering the issues Liverpool are facing right now defensively, his skills can definitely become a problem for the team coached by Arne Slot. The Inter captain scored in all five of his Champions League games at the San Siro in 2025 (8 goals). The only player to score in more than six consecutive home appearances in the competition for an Italian club was Andriy Shevchenko for AC Milan (seven from March 2004 to September 2005). -- Francesco Porzio\nPrediction: Inter 2, Liverpool 1 -- Salah's shadow looms large over this match, though that may only rattle Liverpool so much considering the Egypt international has been far from his peak this season. The Reds' real problem is that no matter how hard manager Arne Slot tries, he cannot seem to find a balance with the players at his disposal. They are inconsistent in more ways than one, making Tuesday's game much more favorable to Inter than one may have anticipated when the league phase schedule came out several months ago.--  Pardeep CattryBest bet: Inter Milan to win (+110) -- Even without the Mohamed Salah drama at Liverpool, this is quite a mismatch of teams. Since losing to Atletico Madrid in UCL, Milan have responded by winning their last three matches by an aggregate score of 11-1. Lautaro Martinez is going to give Virgil Van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate nightmares in defense, but even if he's stopped, this squad is a unit that will be hard to stop. -- Chuck Booth Barcelona vs. Eintracht FrankfurtPlayer to watch: Lamine Yamal, Barcelona -- At 18 years of age, Yamal is already one of the best wingers in the world. Pressed into central areas amid an injury crisis, Yamal proved he's not too shabby as a number 10 either, delivering gaudy chance creation and possession value numbers in a 5-3 win at Real Betis that cemented Barcelona's lead at the top of La Liga. In a clash that is sure to offer plenty of space to operate, this could be another game for Yamal to unleash his precocious talents. -- James BengeMan of the match: Robert Lewandowski, Barcelona -- After losing 3-0 in the last Champions League game against Chelsea, the team coached by Hansi Flick got back on track in the league and have won three matches in a row and thanks to the results of their competitors, they are now four points ahead of Real Madrid. This is an important game for Lewandoski, who faced Frankfurt multiple times over his career. He has scored 15 goals in his last 15 starts against Eintracht Frankfurt across all competitions, including two hat-tricks in two 5-0 victories as a Bayern Munich player. -- Francesco Porzio\nPrediction: Barcelona 3, Eintracht Frankfurt 2 -- Neither of these teams have any real ability to defend, with Barcelona conceding 10 goals and Eintracht Frankfurt letting in 14 through five Champions League games so far. An entertaining, and perhaps silly, game is likely in store as a result, but in the end, this will be Barcelona's fixture to lose. Their attackers are likely to show their quality against a porous back line, giving them the edge in an important fixture weeks after their loss at Chelsea. --  Pardeep CattryBest bet:  First half over 1.5 goals (-144): This is almost an auto bet at this point. Barcelona games are box office for plenty of reasons, and the goals allowed are one of them. Both of these teams play an all gas, no brakes brand of soccer that leads to goals left and right. This is likely a ladder scenario especially when Barcelona needs points to make up for their loss to Chelsea. -- Chuck BoothChampions League matches on WednesdayMatchup\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    James Benge\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Francesco Porzio\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Pardeep Cattry\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Chuck Booth\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Roger Gonzalez\n                            \n            Qarabag vs. Ajax1-02-01-02-02-0Villarreal vs. Copenhagen2-01-01-00-12-1Benfica vs. Napoli2-21-20-21-21-1Bilbao vs. PSG0-22-30-20-30-3Club Brugge vs. Arsenal1-20-30-20-21-3Dortmund vs. Bodo/Glimt2-02-12-12-01-2Leverkusen vs. Newcastle0-01-10-10-11-2Juventus vs. Pafos4-03-03-02-13-0Real Madrid vs. Man City2-12-21-21-12-2Game of the day: Real Madrid vs. Man CityPlayer to watch: Kylian Mbappe, Real Madrid -- For all the drama that swirls around the Santiago Bernabeu, where there already seem to be questions over Xabi Alonso's future, one thing has remained constant this season. Kylian Mbappe scores goals. Twenty-five in 21 club games this season, to be precise. It was against Manchester City nearly nine years ago that the then-Monaco forward first showed his prodigious talents and he has rarely let up on them since, netting a brilliant hat trick to knock them out of last season's Champions League. -- James BengeMan of the match: Jeremy Doku, Manchester City -- Pep Guardiola is back at the Bernabeu again playing against Real Madrid, the fourth most-faced team in his coaching career after Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United. The Citizens are in great form and are back in contention for the Premier League as well while Real Madrid are facing a crisis with only one win in the last five LaLiga games (three draws, one win, one defeat). The pace and the technique of Doku can definitely become a big issue for the team managed by Xabi Alonso. -- Francesco Porzio\nPrediction: Real Madrid 1, Manchester City 2 -- He may have started the job a few months ago, but it's already time to talk about Xabi Alonso's job security, momentum perhaps swinging in Manchester City's favor ahead of the most anticipated game on Matchday 6. Momentum is not the only reason to pick City -- flawed as they are in Pep Guardiola's latest rebuild, the ideas seem to be clicking more often than not, plus Erling Haaland's always impressive form always makes them a contender. --  Pardeep CattryBest bet: Kylian Mbappe and Erling Haaland to have 2+ shots on target (+164): Back your stars? Both of these teams are in a bit of a rut but they'll look to get their star strikers shots to get out of them. Mbappe has continued to score no matter what happens with the club, and City's only option is to feed Haaland, so let's back them.-- Chuck BoothLeverkusen vs. NewcastlePlayer to watch: Bruno Guimaraes, Newcastle -- After Alexander Isak's departure, Eddie Howe needed others to step up and share a scoring load that would have weighed too strongly on Nick Woltemade otherwise. Guimaraes has certainly done that, his five increasingly impressive goals so far this season, culminating in a wicked corner that swerved straight in in Saturday's 2-1 win over Burnley. That Guimaraes has the quality to impose himself on Leverkusen's talented midfield only makes it more important that he excels at the Bay Arena. -- James BengeMan of the match: Patrick Schick, Bayer Leverkusen -- The German side has had some ups and down in the past weeks, but also won 2-0 in their last Champions League tie against Manchester City, one of the most surprising results of the season so far. Facing Newcastle at home, they have an immense chance to score some big points ahead of the next phase. Patrick Schick is in great form and has already scored two goals in the three Champions League matches he played so far. -- Francesco Porzio\nPrediction: Bayer Leverkusen 0, Newcastle United 1 -- It has been an up and down season for both of these teams, who are likely to keep things tight in a closely-contested game. Newcastle United, though, have the quality needed to take all three points home with them, calling upon the likes of Nick Woltemade and Anthony Gordon to get the job done in attack. --  Pardeep CattryBest bet: Under 2.5 goals (+110): With Leverkusen finding their feet, this is a hard matchup to pick, but it could turn into a defensive slugfest. Newcastle United have only allowed more than one goal in three of their last 11 games so it's safe to say that Leverkusen will struggle to score, but the Magpies' attack has also struggled to get things going. -- Chuck Booth\n            ",

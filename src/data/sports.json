Tyler Huntley helped them get a much-needed win in Week 8, though, and in a watered-down AFC North, the Ravens are hoping to rally and become just the fifth team to make the postseason after a 1-5 start.The Dolphins are 2-6 but are also coming off an impressive win, beating the Atlanta Falcons 34-10 to snap a three-game losing streak. Tua Tagovailoa threw four touchdown passes, and the defense allowed just 45 rushing yards after allowing 100+ in each of the first seven games.Here's how to watch the action, as well as betting information, keys to the game and a prediction.\nWhere to watch Ravens vs. Dolphins liveDate: Thursday, Oct. 30 | Time: 8:15 p.m. ETWhere: Hard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, FloridaStream: Amazon PrimeFollow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Ravens -10.5; O/U 50.5 (via FanDuel)You can bet Ravens vs. Dolphins at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:Dolphins vs. Ravens: Need to knowWhat does Lamar Jackson have in store in his return? Even amid Baltimore's difficult start, Jackson was playing at a high level. He currently leads the NFL with a 130.5 passer rating, and his 10-1 touchdown-to-interception ratio ranks fourth. Jackson also had the league's highest sack rate, though, so he will have to improve in those aspects. Still, he should revitalize a passing attack that went mostly dormant during his absence. From Weeks 5-8, the Ravens had the second-fewest passing yards in the NFL, and their one passing touchdown over that span was tied for the fewest in the league.Both defenses are playing better. The Ravens and the Dolphins both rank in the bottom 10 of the NFL in terms of yards per play allowed, but both have improved lately thanks in large part to better rush defense. Over their past two games, the Ravens have allowed just 3.7 yards per carry, down from 4.7 prior to that this season. The Dolphins, meanwhile, have allowed just 3.0 yards per carry over the past two weeks, second in the NFL. Miami had allowed 5.6 yards per carry prior to that this season.It's a clash of styles. The Dolphins field one of the NFL's lightest and fastest offenses, highlighted by De'Von Achane. The Ravens aim to be bigger and more physical, as evidenced by Derrick Henry. It's a fascinating clash of styles. Miami's safeties and linebackers will have their hands full trying to keep up with Achane, whose 37 receptions are second-most by a running back this season.Prediction\nThe Ravens are finally rounding into form on defense, and Jackson's return should help them do the same on offense, but don't sleep on Miami's speed. Tagovailoa led Miami to a 42-38 stunner over Baltimore in 2022, only for Jackson to lead a 56-19 rout the following year. Expect plenty of fireworks and, ultimately, a Ravens win.\nPick: Ravens +7.5, Over 50.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Austin Reaves didn't even technically arrive on the Los Angeles Lakers as a fully rostered player. His initial contract as an undrafted free agent was a two-way deal. A strong summer got him bumped up to a standard deal and roster spot before his 2021-22 rookie season began, but that set the stage for what the beginning of his career has looked like.Every year, Reaves is asked to prove himself. Can this undrafted rookie play on a team with championship hopes? Can he be the third-scorer and secondary after the Lakers traded away Russell Westbrook? Can he be a full-time starter? A core part of a contender?He's met every challenge. His growth has been remarkably linear. His scoring has jumped 5.7, 2.9 and 4.3 points per game with each successive season. His assists grew similarly over his first three seasons before plateauing last year, when he suddenly had to share the floor with two Hall of Famers. One of those Hall of Famers, LeBron James, hasn't yet played this season. Frankly, Reaves has been so good in Year 5 that it might now be incumbent upon James to adjust to him. Through five games, Reaves is averaging 34.2 points and 10 assists per game. On Wednesday, he sent the same Minnesota Timberwolves team that bottled him up in the first round last season home on a game-winning buzzer-beating runner. Despite scoring 28 points in the victory, he's been so hot lately that his scoring average went down after the game. \nAt this point, his successful five-year partnership with James is a lesser concern. Really, it's the other Hall of Famer that matters here, because everything the Los Angeles Lakers have done since acquiring Luka Dončić has seemingly been to land exactly the sort of co-star Reaves is becoming.They've hoarded cap space for max free agents. They've preserved draft picks knowing they'll have three first-rounders to deal this offseason. Renouncing the Mark Williams trade was primarily a medical issue, yes, but it's hard not to view it as an asset-allocation matter as well. Why take this sort of risk on an injured role player when those same chips could be cashed in for someone far better down the line? With Reaves headed for unrestricted free agency in 2026, he could even have potentially been signed-and-traded out in a package for such a bigger fish. It was incumbent upon him to prove he was too good to be shopped in that matter.And if 34 points and 10 assists per game thus far isn't enough to do that? Well, nothing will be. The individual stats don't quite do him justice. Look at how well Dončić played in his first two games with just Reaves and no James by his side: 46 points, 11.5 rebounds and 8.5 assists per game on 62% shooting from the floor. Not only is Reaves ascending, specifically, but he's doing so in ways that are inherently beneficial to Dončić. He's a good enough on-ball creator to take pressure off of him. And he's not so ball-dominant that he'll get in Dončić's way. His foul-bating stops the clock, giving Dončić extra breathers. His shooting spaces the floor for him. The partnership, thus far, is everything the Lakers could have hoped it would be.\nAnd if that's the case, well, it changes quite a bit about how the Lakers can approach building this team in both the short- and long-term. If there's less of an imperative to hoard assets for another superstar in the future, for instance, those assets could be spent in the present on badly-needed defensive role players. Doing so would allow the Lakers to capitalize on that other legend they already have, James, who doesn't seem all that likely to be around much longer. Trading picks for win-now help doesn't compromise the Dončić timeline as much if the Lakers believe they already have their second star in Reaves to keep beside him for the long haul.The hardest thing to do for a prospective champion is get the true superstar. The Lakers pulled that particular rabbit out of their hat in February. They've acted as though the next step is the logical, linear progression: get him the sidekick. But if the early portion of this season is any indication, the sidekick is already here. Finding those two players is the hardest part, because as Dončić showed in Dallas, just give him one other All-Star-caliber offensive teammate and he can take you to the NBA Finals. The Lakers have seemingly done so. They may still try to get another, of course. These are the Lakers we're talking about, after all. If they think they have any prayer at a player like Giannis Antetokounmpo or Nikola Jokić as 2027 free agents, they're not going to punt that hope away. But there's no longer that desperation, that fixation on potentially wasting a year or more waiting for the chance to trade for something they thought they needed. Austin Reaves is an All-Star now. He and Dončić can be the foundation of a championship-level offense. And if that's the case, all that remains is building a defense worthy of their gifts. Dallas did so with far less draft ammunition to spend in a far less desirable market. While the Lakers still have a ways to go, the path to building their eventual winner has never looked cleaner.\n            ",

Trey Yesavage dominated the Los Angeles Dodgers hitters in Game 5 Wednesday, setting the rookie World Series record with 12 strikeouts, and the Blue Jays offense came through again, including back-to-back home runs by Davis Schneider and Vladimir Guerrero Jr. to lead off the game. The series now shifts back to Toronto for Game 6 Friday.The Dodgers are trying to become the first back-to-back World Series champions since the 1998-2000 New York Yankees. The Blue Jays are looking for their first title since back-to-back wins in 1992 and 1993.The Jays punched their ticket to the Fall Classic with an ALCS Game 7 win over the Seattle Mariners. This is Toronto's first World Series appearance since 1993, when they won their second consecutive title. The Dodgers thoroughly dismantled the Milwaukee Brewers, owners of MLB's best record during the regular season, in the NLCS to return to the World Series. They are the first defending champion to reach the World Series the next season since the 2008-09 Philadelphia Phillies, and, in more than a few ways, this year's Dodgers are better than last year's.The Blue Jays (94-68) have home-field advantage over the Dodgers (93-69) in the World Series because they had the better regular-season record.

    "body": "\n        LOS ANGELES -- I did something on Wednesday that I've never done before: I changed my pick. On CBS Sports HQ at noon ET, I said the Dodgers would win Game 5 of the World Series. Six hours later, back on CBS Sports HQ from Dodger Stadium, I said that I changed my mind and was taking the Blue Jays. After the hit, a colleague asked me who I thought would win the series. And I said I think the Blue Jays. Before the series started, I predicted he Dodgers would win in five.Now, after a 6-1 Blue Jays win in Game 5, I'm convinced on the Blue Jays. They've got this series.There's just been a total vibe shift for me and much of it is based on the fortitude the Blue Jays continue to display. There's a feeling in the clubhouse that's almost palpable. Sure, every team that has ever been in the World Series has said similar things and every team that gets here believes they are going to win it. But there's a feel that is difficult to describe. This Blue Jays team feels like they simply will not be denied. There's been plenty of adversity, but they respond every single time.If they haven't lost this series yet, they just aren't going to lose it.They lost one of their best hitters, George Springer, to injury; he hasn't played since leaving Game 3 early. They are using a guy who didn't return from Tommy John surgery until August in the rotation alongside a rookie who only made three MLB starts before the playoffs. They have a patchwork bullpen. There's a 31-year-old rookie in Nathan Lukes, who spent 10 years in the minors. Bo Bichette is playing injured. Their big offseason addition, Anthony Santander, was a relative bust in the regular season and is now injured and out. They lost the first two games of the ALCS at home and still won the series. They fell behind 2-1 in the World Series after a heartbreaking, 18-inning Game 3 loss. Now, they have a 3-2 lead. And they are going back home, where they were 54-27 this season. Including the playoffs, that home record jumps to 59-30, the best mark in all of baseball. \n\"I can't wait to see what the Rogers Centre is going to look, feel, and sound like,\" manager John Schneider said after Game 5.They've been on a mission since late May. After a loss on May 27, they were 26-28. They went 68-40 the rest of the way, clinching their first AL East title since 2015.\"This is what we do. This is what we've been doing for the last four months of the year,\" Max Scherzer said Wednesday. \"Once we got going in mid-May, June, when this clubhouse clicked, everybody in here knew what was up. Then we started playing a different brand of ball. We leveled up.\" \nThe aforementioned rookie, 22-year-old Trey Yesavage, completely dominated the Dodgers' offense in Game 5. He was breathtaking and served as the star of the show in Game 5. He was heavy with his excellent slider and, as usual, used the splitter as his out pitch. He got 10 swings on the splitter, including seven whiffs. In all, he struck out 12 Dodgers, breaking the rookie record in a World Series game -- coincidentally, it was Dodgers pitcher Don Newcombe who previously had the record (1949 Game 1).\"The best part about it was that he wasn't any different than a game in September,\" Chris Bassitt said. \"He's just complete, composed and the moment's not too big for him, which is crazy for how young he is... Some guys are just built different and he's built different. To walk in with that kind of confidence and come into this place, it's like, damn.\" \"That first game [Yesavage pitched], you could just see, this is different,\" Scherzer said. \"He can go up against anybody right now.\" \nYesavage only allowed three hits in Game 5; two of them were infield singles. He had never before thrown a pitch in the seventh inning in a start, not even in the minors. He completed seven innings in this one. It was masterful.\"The maturity he's shown to handle these moments is really impressive,\" Bo Bichette said.How about Davis Schneider? He had only started four playoff games so far out of 15 Blue Jays postseason games. He hadn't hit leadoff. He was thrown into the spot, in part due to the Springer injury. He homered on the first pitch of the game from two-time Cy Young winner Blake Snell. It's just a next-man-up mentality with this team. Clement and Addison Barger and Daulton Varsho and Andrés Giménez and, well, pretty much everyone. Isiah Kiner-Falefa even had an RBI single in this one.\nOf course, there was also the superstar, Vladimir Guerrero Jr., with a home run right after Schneider. It was the first time in history that a team hit back-to-back home runs to start a World Series game. Snell had never given up two first-inning home runs in his career previously, so it was a double dose of history. It was a special start to the game, followed by a special performance from Yesavage. It's a special team. Snell, by the way, was on a monster run of dominance before the World Series. The Blue Jays pounced on him twice this series. He's given up 10 runs on 14 hits in 11 ⅔ innings. That's a 7.71 ERA. In his previous three playoff starts, he had an 0.86 ERA. \nThe Jays just can't be stopped. The team that led the majors in batting average during the regular season that can also hit for power is relentless, even short a few guys due to injury. It was on display in both Games 4 and 5. They'll club big home runs but also string hits together and make you pay for your mistakes. Take the third run. The Dodgers had just cut the lead to 2-1. Daulton Varsho sent a shot down the right field line. It was clearly a hit, but Teoscar Hernández misplayed it into a triple. Varsho then scored immediately on a sac fly. They just find ways to punish their opponents. Again and again. A single and a walk both came around to score in the seventh inning, pushing the lead to 5-1. A wild pitch contributed to a run in the eighth. They've also hit 27 home runs in 16 postseason games. They just attack from every angle. To reiterate, yes, every single World Series team should believe in themselves, but there is an air about these Jays. Just look at the other dugout. Did the Dodgers look like a hungry team fighting for its life in Game 5 or did they appear lifeless? Some of that is the dominant pitching from Yesavage, but the Dodgers made plenty of mistakes on the pitching and defense side of things. \nLook, the Dodgers could very well still win this series by bouncing back and looking like the elite version of themselves. They could win two games in Toronto. Would anyone be shocked? The Blue Jays are ready. \"We've been in situations where you know the series can change,\" Scherzer said. \"We just gotta take care of business. We've gotta go 1-0, take it one game at a time and play the game we always play.\" \"That's an amazing team and they're defending champs,\" Bichette said of the Dodgers. \"They're gonna come out and fight, so we need to be ready.\"\nI just don't think a Dodgers comeback will happen. I think the Blue Jays have this series. They are in control right now and just need to win one game in two chances at home. It won't take two. Blue Jays in six. I was wrong before the series, but I'm tired of being wrong about this group of uncommon men. They will soon be crowned World Series champions.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Motor sports have skyrocketed in popularity over the last few years, which has brought mainstream sports fans to F1 betting and NASCAR betting through pop culture. We'll take a look at how sportsbooks operate when it comes to motor sports, how bettors can wager on racing events and go over some of the best strategies and tips when it comes to racing betting.Finding the best sportsbook promos for motor sports bettingHere's a look at some of the promotions going on at top sportsbooks for fans interested in getting into motor sports betting.BrandPromoCBS promo codeDraftKingsBet $5, get $300 in bonus bets + 3 months free NBA League PassJust click hereFanDuelBet $5, get $300 in bonus bets if your bet winsJust click hereCaesarsBet $1, double your winnings your next 20 betsCBS20XBetMGMUp to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet losesCBSSPORTSFanaticsBet and Get Up To $2,000 in Bet Insurance FanCashJust click herebet365Bet $5, get $200 in bonus bets win or loseCBSBET365DraftKings, FanDuel and bet365 are all offering \"bet and get\" promotions where users get bonus bets after wagering $5 or more. FanDuel requires a user's first bet to win, while DraftKings and bet365 provide bonus bets regardless of the outcome of the qualifying bet. DraftKings is also giving users a discount on NFL Sunday Ticket for the 2025 season.BetMGM and Fanatics Sportsbook are also giving out bonus bets but in a different way. BetMGM covers a user's first bet up to $1,500 with bonus bets if that first bet loses, but users must wager at least $1,500 to be eligible for the full amount. Fanatics has shifted its promotion to specific days where users can wager up to $100 on football and receive bonus bets back if their wager loses.Caesars Sportsbook has gone away from bonus bets, instead offering 20 100% profit boost after users wager $1 or more at the sportsbook.Before you get into motor sports betting, it's important to find a sportsbook which consistently provides odds for races. There's always value in shopping around multiple sportsbooks for the best lines, but some platforms do not offer extensive betting markets for motorsports compared to others.What do motor sports odds mean?When it comes to motorsports and racing markets, odds are displayed and read similarly to how they are for most sports. Let's say a driver is priced at -150 to win the Dutch Grand Prix on Aug. 31, and the next best driver has +200 odds. That means the driver at -150 is a decent favorite to win, and you'd have to risk $150 to win $100. The second driver is a contender but is unlikely to win in the eyes of oddsmakers, but you'd win $200 after risking $100 if he does indeed pull off the upset.When you can bet on motor sports oddsThe racing schedule varies across NASCAR, F1 and IndyCar but there are usually weekly races with occasional breaks. NASCAR has multiple series, so there's usually at least one race across the series every weekend. F1 has a set calendar for the year with some breaks in between, but there are junior Formula racing series which might be going on in some of the gaps on the main circuit.Typically, the actual race will take place on a Sunday. There will be practice on either Thursday or Friday, with a qualifying event to set up the grid on either Friday or Saturday depending on the race schedule. Qualifying usually takes place the day before the race. Bettors can wager on qualifying outcomes as well, and those results will shift the race odds.Biggest races for motor sports bettingNetflix's \"Drive to Survive,\" NASCAR's Chicago Street Race and big-budget films like Ford v. Ferrari and F1: The Movie have brought a new audience to racing, and that means more action when it comes to racing betting. Arguably the biggest sporting event in the racing world is the Indianapolis 500, which is traditionally held on Memorial Day weekend. That's the premier IndyCar event.NASCAR has several big races, with the Daytona 500, a Crown Jewel event, regarded as the richest race on the circuit. The Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte and the Brickyard 400 are also considered Crown Jewel events. Talladega Speedway is a widely known track thanks to the movie \"Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby\" but it is not a Crown Jewel event.Every F1 race has its unique twist, as the tracks are different in each city, but Monaco is considered the biggest spectacle of the season. The race itself is somewhat mundane, as there's little opportunity for drivers to pass each other. The British Grand Prix at Silverstone, the Italian Grand Prix at Monza and the Singapore Grand Prix are considered some marquee events on the F1 calendar. The Abu Dhabi Grand Prix is also a high-profile event as it is typically last on the calendar and could decide who wins the drivers championship and constructors championship. F1 has also added special events like Miami and Las Vegas.Types of bets and how motor sports betting works Like all sports betting markets, there are a variety of ways prospective bettors can wager on motor sports. Here's a look at some of them.Outright/To Win oddsThis market is straightforward. Users are betting on which driver will win the event. There are also markets here for which team/constructor car will win the event, which will have multiple cars involved.Placement/Top Finish oddsMotor sports betting offers users the ability to wager on drivers or teams having a certain placement or finishing within a certain range. For example, you can wager on drivers to place in the top 5 or top 10 of the event. You can do the same with teams/constructors.While it rarely occurs in racing, there's a possibility of multiple drivers tying for a position. In this case, technically there are multiple winning bets but sportsbooks grade dead heats differently and the payouts can be different. If FanDuel declares a dead heat, half the stake is applied at the original odds and half the stake is lost. If there are more than two dead heats, the stakes are proportioned accordingly.Dual ForecastThis is where bettors can place a wager on which drivers will finish first and second. Both drivers must finish in the correct order for this wager to be paid out as a win. For example, you can wager on Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton to finish first and second, respectively in a Dual Forecast market in F1 betting. However, if Verstappen finishes second and Hamilton finishes first, your bet will lose even though you did correctly pick the top two drivers for the race.Each Way BettingThis might not be as common in motor sports but can be applied to racing betting. An each way bet basically places two wagers: a driver to win and to finish above another position. If the driver wins, both bets get paid out. The same applies for team bets in this market.Stage WinnerThis is prevalent in NASCAR and IndyCar, which has more laps than Formula One. You can bet on which driver or team will be in the lead after 25 laps, 50 laps, 100 laps and so on. These are the stages.Matchups/Head-to-HeadSportsbooks will put two drivers or two teams against each other and bettors can choose which one will place higher. For teams, the bet is usually on the highest-placed driver for that particular team. For example, if a market was being offered on F1 to see if Ferrari or Mercedes placed higher, a winning Ferrari driver would give Ferrari bettors the win even if the Mercedes drivers combined to finish higher than the Ferrari drivers.Group WinnerThis is offered in NASCAR. Sportsbooks will put a handful of drivers in groups and ask which will be the winner of the group.Top Car Make DriverThis is also specific to NASCAR, where you can bet on whether the winning driver will be in a particular car manufacturer, like Ford or Chevy. It's more applicable here since there are only two drivers on each F1 constructor, while car brands can span several NASCAR teams.Team of Race WinnerThis is similar to Outright Winner for drivers but applies to teams and constructors.Qualifying BetsBettors can wager on who will take pole position and which cars will be on pole. These are determined during qualifying racing, which typically takes place the day before the race. You can also bet on markets offering odds for who will finish in the top 5 or top 10 in qualifying, though these necessarily aren't available for every race. The results of qualifying will often shift the race odds.Motor sports futures bettingFormula 1 bettingIn most cases, F1 futures usually apply to the next race. However, you can bet on season-long futures for the drivers and constructors championships. The drivers championship is straightforward as it will be given to the driver who accumulates the most points over the season. The constructors championship takes into account the points for both team drivers. Only the top 10 finishers in each race score points, and those points are tallied over the season. The winning driver can be part of a constructors championship, but that's not always the case.NASCAR bettingNASCAR has different portions of the season. There are also different circuits like the Cup Series, the Xfinity Series and Truck Series. You can bet on marquee races for NASCAR in the futures market, and you can also wager on winners for these particular series.IndyCarThe major marquee futures market for IndyCar is the Indianapolis 500. Other than that race, there's season-long championship odds for the circuit.Can you parlay wagers in motor sports betting?While parlaying is generally not advised as you don't get appropriate odds from sportsbooks which correspond to the actual chance of your bet winning, you are able to parlay outcomes in motor sports betting. While you can't pick multiple drivers to win an event in a parlay, you can pick multiple drivers to finish in the top 5 or top 10. You can also pick teams to finish in the top 5 or top 10.How to bet on motor sports live during a raceSportsbooks do offer live odds for motor sports, though this is likely a more prominent feature for NASCAR and IndyCar as opposed to F1. Driver and team odds will shift based on where they are in the grand scheme of the race. NASCAR and IndyCar allow for more leeway since there are more laps, while F1 can sometimes shift quickly towards one driver or team.Tips and strategies for how to bet on motor sportsDriver form does matter when it comes to racing, but the biggest predictor of success is usually how each team can adjust to conditions. Races can take place in all kinds of weather and team strategy can make or break the day. There are some teams that struggle to adjust, and bettors should know which teams those are before placing wagers.Historical track success does matter, but it often takes a back seat to current form. For example, Max Verstappen won the Canadian Grand Prix three years in a row and was a contender after starting second behind George Russell in 2025. Russell has had mixed results in Montreal historically but wound up winning the race after winning qualifying to take pole position.Longshots don't usually win races, but it's not uncommon to see them do well in the Placement markets. You can usually back drivers who have had success on certain tracks or who have routinely finished just outside of a certain position market to break through eventually.Occasionally, a caution flag comes out when there's a crash on the track which makes racing conditions hazardous for everyone. When this happens, there will be a safety car deployed and all drivers must line up behind the safety car until the wreck is managed. This has sometimes happened on the last lap of the race, which can completely eliminate the leader's edge on the field. There are different rules for each association and sometimes the race organizer makes a call in the moment, but usually, the race cannot end on a caution flag. If the wreck is too big to clear in a reasonable amount of time, the race will end despite the caution flag being signaled. Overtime doesn't really exist, but usually there will be at least one additional lap of racing should the fallout of the crash get removed in a timely manner and the safety car gets taken off the track.FAQCan you bet on motor sports?As long as you are of legal age in a state where sports betting is legitimate, you should be able to find a sportsbook which provides racing and motor sports odds.Who to bet on for the Indy 500?Because the Indy 500 typically takes place over Memorial Day weekend, you'll have to wait for a bit before placing wagers on who will win the signature event. Josef Newgarden won the Indy 500 in 2023 and 2024 but Alex Palou won in 2025 and is the reigning champion.Can you bet on SuperCross?SuperCross is a type of motorcycle racing and some sportsbooks do offer SuperCross odds in certain states.Can you bet on motocross at DraftKings?DraftKings does provide SuperCross odds, which is a motocross competition, in select states. You must be of legal age and residing in those states to bet on motocross at DraftKings.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Toronto Blue Jays are one win away from becoming 2025 World Series champions.Behind a record-setting Trey Yesavage start and back-to-back home runs to lead off the game, the Blue Jays took Game 5 from the Los Angeles Dodgers, giving them a 3-2 series lead. Game 6 is back in Toronto Friday.The Blue Jays got to Shohei Ohtani in Game 4 Tuesday and he was on the hook for four runs, including a two-run home run by Vladimir Guerrero Jr. Shane Bieber, on the other hand, held the Dodgers hitters to just one run, a sacrifice fly off the bat of Kiké Hernández. The Game 4 win ties the series at 2 and guarantees at least one more game in Toronto on Halloween.The Dodgers took a wild Game 3 on a Freddie Freeman walk-off home run in the 18th inning Monday. Yoshinobu Yamamoto tossed a complete game in Los Angeles' Game 2 win, while the Blue Jays won Game 1 in an 11-4 blowout, including a grand slam by Addison Barger as part of a nine-run sixth inning.\nThe Dodgers are back in the World Series for the second year in a row, looking to become the first back-to-back champion since the 1998-2000 Yankees. They completed their NLCS sweep of the Milwaukee Brewers last week and had a week off before World Series Game 1. They are the first reigning champion to return to the World Series since the 2009 Phillies. The Blue Jays, meanwhile, took a tougher route through the ALCS but came out victorious in Game 7 against the Seattle Mariners. This marks their first World Series appearance since 1993.

Texas coach Steve Sarkisian said Monday that Manning was in concussion protocol after exiting Saturday's 45-38 win over Mississippi State after his helmet made contact with the turf at the end of a 13-yard scramble.Manning knifed his way through the heart of Mississippi State's defense in overtime with the score tied at 38 before he was tackled by Bulldogs safety Isaac Smith and defensive lineman Kedrick Bingley-Jones, who hit him from behind.Manning tried to get up with the help of Texas offensive tackle Brandon Baker before motioning for trainers from a seated position on the turf.

The NCAA's concussion safety protocol management mandates Manning would need to be cleared by medical personnel before returning to play. \nFollowing Wednesday's injury report, additional status updates for Manning will be released each day leading up to gameday.At 6-2 overall and 3-1 in conference play, Texas enters a pivotal final stretch beginning with next weekend's tilt against the 10th-ranked Commodores at DKR-Texas Memorial Stadium. Sarkisian's team is off the following week before traveling to fifth-ranked Georgia, hosting Arkansas and then entertaining the SEC's lone unbeaten, Texas A&M, in the regular-season finale on Nov. 28.Winning out from here would not only guarantee a third consecutive playoff appearance for the Longhorns, but would but a ticket to Atlanta in the SEC Championship Game.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Miami Dolphins (2-6) host the Baltimore Ravens (2-5) on Thursday Night Football to open the Week 9 NFL schedule. Last week, the Ravens snapped a four-game losing streak with a 30-16 victory over the Bears, coming out of their bye week. Quarterback Lamar Jackson has missed the last three games for the Ravens due to a hamstring injury, but he's expected to play on Thursday. The Dolphins, meanwhile, are coming off a 34-10 win over the Falcons last week behind four touchdown passes by Tua Tagovailoa. The Ravens are 7.5-point favorites, according to the latest Dolphins vs. Ravens odds, while the over/under for total points scored is 50.5.There are dozens of betting options if you're wondering how to bet on the NFL, or more specifically, Ravens vs. Dolphins.

Jackson suffered his hamstring injury in Week 4 in a 37-20 loss to the Chiefs, and Baltimore went 1-2 in the last three weeks that he didn't start. Although the Dolphins are coming off a 34-10 win last week, that came against a 37-year-old Kirk Cousins making his first start of the season, and he was without his WR1 in Drake London (hip). Miami allowed at least 27 points in its prior three games, all losses against the Panthers, Chargers and Browns, as the majority of those teams don't strike much fear in opposing defenses. With Jackson back, the model expects the Ravens offense to have strong success on Thursday. The model projects the Ravens to cover in 52% of simulations.Over 50.5 pointsThe Ravens and Dolphins both have bottom-six scoring defenses in the NFL this season, with Baltimore ranking 30th at 30 points per game allowed, and Miami ranking tied for 26th at 26.9 ppg allowed this year. Both units played well last week, with the Ravens holding the Bears to 16 points and the Dolphins holding the Falcons to 10 points, but the statistics indicate that's more of an anomaly than the norm. The Dolphins have allowed at least 27 points in six of eight games, including four contests allowing more than 30 points, and the Ravens have allowed at least 37 points in four of seven games this season. Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa threw four touchdowns against an Atlanta defense that was strong against the pass over the first seven weeks, and with Jackson back on Thursday, this contest has shootout potential. The model projects the Over to hit in 68% of simulations.Responsible gamingResponsible gaming is a serious topic, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users play responsibly.

The former Alabama standout signed with the Ravens in 2024 and delivered a massive output in his first season in Baltimore, carrying the ball 325 times for 1,921 rushing yards and 16 touchdowns while averaging 5.9 yards per carry. His physical style and durability remained elite even after turning 30, showcasing several long runs and a dominance after contact that reinforced his Hall of Fame trajectory. In 2025, Henry continues to be a major factor in Baltimore's offense, though his workload has slightly decreased. Through six games, he has totaled 88 carries for 439 yards (5.0 yards per carry) and four rushing touchdowns. While those numbers are below his 2024 peak, he remains one of the most respected and productive power backs in the league. See who else to roster right here.\nPart of Kaylor's optimal NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering Dolphins running back De'Von Achane. The former third-round pick out of Texas A&M emerged as a dynamic dual-threat back for the Dolphins in 2024, rushing 203 times for 907 yards and six touchdowns while adding 78 receptions for 592 yards and six more scores. His average of 4.5 yards per carry showcased his balance of power and burst, while his impact as a receiver made him one of the NFL's most versatile backs. Through the early part of the 2025 season, Achane has maintained that explosiveness, totaling 107 carries for 539 rushing yards and three touchdowns while averaging 5.0 yards per carry. Although his touchdown pace has dipped slightly, his overall efficiency and big-play potential remain strong. Achane's combination of elite speed and pass-catching ability continues to make him a key weapon in Miami's high-octane offense. You can see the rest of Kaylor's NFL DFS picks here.New users can see the latest FanDuel promo code to get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:\nHow to build NFL DFS lineups and stacks for Ravens vs. DolphinsKaylor is also targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on Thursday.

    "body": "\n        The college football coaching carousel creates chaos on an annual basis. With 10 jobs open already before the end of October (not including two gigs filled over the offseason on what may be a temporary basis), insiders are forecasting one of busiest seasons of coaching changes we've seen in recent years. It's not just about the coaches who are fired and filling those jobs. It's then about filling whatever vacancies are left behind, creating domino effect of coaching changes. This week on CBS Sports HQ, we sought out to create the most chaotic series of coaching dominos while still maintaining some tie to reality. It is very important that you, the reader and the viewer, to understand that this is a work of fan fiction and not to be mistaken for reporting. Some of these moves very well could end up happening, but ultimately the goal was to connect as many dots as possible while also creating as much upheaval as possible across the coaching landscape. \nSo let's have some fun and set off a couple of dominos to see how far down the coaching carousel rabbit hole we can go. Domino 1: The B1G One UCLA hires James Franklin Penn State hires Mike Elko Texas A&M hires Lincoln Riley USC hires Jedd Fisch Washington hires Ryan Grubb Penn State is already open, and while candidates like Matt Rhule and Curt Cignetti were the first names mentioned after James Franklin was fired it's possible that both coaches are going to stay with their current employer through at least the 2026 season. \nThat would have the Nittany Lions looking for some of the other top names in the industry, which would include seeing if a former Penn player and New Jersey native Mike Elko would be interested in getting the keys to one of the most storied programs in the country. Texas A&M opening would be an intriguing opportunity for anyone, but here we're using it as a chance for Lincoln Riley to return to Texas to restart the clock. And while Jedd Fisch has been doing great work at Washington, USC would be smart to check his availability given his success with the Huskies and at Arizona. UCLA gets the program-builder it needs with Franklin (sorry, Virginia Tech), and finally Washington could fill its open spot with former Huskies offensive coordinator Ryan Grubb, who is currently doing great work with Ty Simpson at Alabama.  Domino 2: The Lane Train fallout Florida hires Lane Kiffin Ole Miss hires Jon Sumrall Tulane hires Hugh Freeze Auburn hires Rhett Lashlee SMU hires Eric Morris While Ole Miss fans are feeling increasingly confident that Lane Kiffin will remain in Oxford, we all realize that any chaos scenario probably requires the Lane Train to be on the move and get the dominos falling in the SEC. \nTulane head coach Jon Sumrall is widely viewed as one of the top candidates for any SEC job, and in this run we've got Ole Miss securing his commitment to take over an operation that now has the blueprint for success in the modern era. That's where things get a little tricky, because Tulane will need a coach and it's possible that Hugh Freeze will need an off ramp after some tough years at Auburn. In a very Dana Holgorsen-to-Houston type move, our fan fiction has Freeze out at Auburn and landing on his feet with the Green Wave, which then opens up another opportunity in the SEC. \n        \n            \n                As coaching carousel floods, will other big schools -- like Auburn and Florida State -- pause on changes?\n                \n                    Brandon Marcello                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhile SMU is well-funded and certainly prepared for a bidding war, we've got Rhett Lashlee leaving to return to Auburn where he was previously an offensive coordinator and then the Mustangs tap one of the top Lone Star State coaches to replace him by hiring North Texas' Eric Morris. Domino 3: LSU, Beamer Ball and Brian Kelly Virginia Tech hires Shane Beamer South Carolina hires Brent Key Georgia Tech hires Brian Kelly LSU hires Eli Drinkwitz Missouri hires Scott Satterfield Cincinnati hires Mike Denbrock Shane Beamer was very careful about his coaching moves while Frank Beamer was still at Virginia Tech, choosing to link up up with his father only near the end of his program-changing run in Blacksburg. But enough time has passed now and things have been rocky enough in Columbia to guess (again, in fan fiction) that returning to Virginia Tech looks more enticing now than it may have in September. Beamer leaving South Carolina could have the Gamecocks looking to Brent Key given the previous SEC assistant experience and success he's had with Georgia Tech. \nAs for replacing Key we're using Atlanta as a soft landing spot for Brian Kelly, who might not command the same salary in the wake of the LSU buyout.Speaking of LSU, Eli Drinkwitz remains one of the top coaches on the hot board for any power conference job that thinks they can lure him away. The Tigers have arguably one of the best jobs in America, with three national championships under three different coaches in the 21st Century (only Ohio State can also claim such an honor). So Drinkwitz lands in Baton Rouge, which then has Missouri looking to another former App State coach in Scott Satterfield, who has flipped Cincinnati into a Big 12 title contender in just a few years. Then when it's time for the Bearcats to make a hire it's not going to be running it back with Brian Kelly, but instead with a former offensive coordinator in Mike Denbrock, who is currently doing great work with Marcus Freeman at Notre Dame. \nPhew. How's all that sound? \n            ",

Unfortunately, we don't live in such a world, and injuries continue to play a central storyline every week, and Week 9 is no exception. While we do focus more on who will be sidelined in a given week, this upcoming slate does feature some positive injury updates. The Ravens will see the return of MVP quarterback Lamar Jackson after a three-game absence due to a hamstring injury. Meanwhile, Kyler Murray (foot) is in play to return this week for the Cardinals, along with J.J. McCarthy (ankle) of the Vikings. Of course, that other side of the coin is prevalent as well, with stars a bit dinged up as we begin the week, which we'll track below. There, you can find the initial injury reports from most teams as they hit the practice field for the first time on Wednesday, as well as the final reports and game designations for Baltimore and Miami. NFL odds via Caesars Sportsbook.

That includes quarterback Lamar Jackson, who practiced fully and is set to make his long-awaited return under center. Hill and Davis did not practice all week, but the Dolphins are still holding out some hope with Davis by not ruling him out on the final injury report. As for the group of questionable players, everyone logged a full practice on Wednesday except for Chubb, who was limited. Carolina Panthers at Green Bay Packers (-13.5)After missing last week's game due to an ankle injury, quarterback Bryce Young was a full participant to begin the week on Wednesday. That's a positive sign that he could make his return to action, which is even more important with veteran backup Andy Dalton not practicing due to a right thumb injury.

    "body": "\n        Ravens running back Derrick Henry surpassed Walter Payton to move into fifth on the NFL's list for all-time rushing touchdowns with two scores in a Week 8 win over the Chicago Bears. Now. Henry and the Ravens will visit the Miami Dolphins for a Thursday Night Football matchup in Week 9 that kicks off at 8:15 p.m. ET. Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson is expected to play after missing last week's game with a hamstring injury, and Baltimore is favored by 7.5 points, while the over/under is 51.5. With Jackson back to hold the defense's attention, Henry is one of our top anytime touchdown scorer picks despite the fact that you'll be paying a premium (-200) in the NFL anytime TD scorer odds.Targeting NFL player props is one way to approach NFL odds at online sports betting sites for Thursday Night Football in Week 9.

Now, it has revealed its top anytime touchdown picks for Dolphins vs. Ravens.Best Week 9 Thursday Night Football anytime TD prop picks:Derrick Henry, Ravens (-200)De'Von Achane, Dolphins (-150)DeAndre Hopkins, Ravens (+550)Parlay these picks for +1600 odds with the latest DraftKings promo code and get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 wager wins and three months free NBA League Pass:Derrick Henry, Ravens (-200, bet365)Despite Lamar Jackson being in and out of the lineup this season, Henry has rushed for six touchdowns over the first seven games of this season. He's sitting on 112 rushing touchdowns in his career, and he's scoring at a clip that brings passing Adrian Peterson (120) and possibly even Marcus Allen (123) into the realm of possibility. The Ravens have the potential to get on a roll with the schedule lightening up and Jackson returning, and Henry figures to be a major focal point of that effort. The model predicts that he scores 0.94 touchdowns on average, while the odds imply a 66.6% chance to score. Use the latest bet365 bonus code to find this price and get $200 in bonus bets after your first $5 wager win or lose.De'Von Achane, Dolphins (-150, FanDuel)We're laying more juice here, but Achane has also proven to be worth paying the premium throughout his NFL career. Despite Miami's general struggles this season, he's scored seven times in eight games, and he's now up to 30 touchdowns in 36 career regular-season outings. His involvement in the Dolphins' passing attack also helps protect him against unfavorable game scripts. The model predicts that he scores 1.04 touchdowns on average despite odds that imply a 40% chance of scoring. Use the latest FanDuel promo code to find this price and get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 wager wins.DeAndre Hopkins, Ravens (+550, DraftKings)Hopkins hasn't been a high-volume target in the Baltimore passing attack, but he has been given high-value opportunities. His lone catch last week against the Bears came on a critical third down to help seal the game in the fourth quarter, and he now has 10 catches for 192 yards and two touchdowns this season despite playing only 28.7% of the offensive snaps. A healthy Jackson should be the rising tide that lifts all boats here, and the model predicts that Hopkins scores 0.26 touchdowns on average, greatly outpacing his implied scoring probability of 15.4%.Want more Thursday Night Football picks?You've seen the model's NFL anytime touchdown prop picks for several players in Dolphins vs. Ravens.

We'll see if this leads to a bounce-back game for Deebo Samuel, who should be considered a No. 2 Fantasy receiver in the majority of leagues.Samuel has been battling a heel injury in recent weeks, and he scored 5.4 PPR points or less in each of his past two games against Chicago and Kansas City. McLaurin played against the Chiefs, but he missed the previous four outings, which was a plus for Samuel.He scored at least 20.1 PPR points in two of those outings, and hopefully he can perform at that level again. This isn't an easy matchup against the Seahawks, but five receivers have scored at least 14.8 PPR points against them this year.\nI hope Samuel can take advantage of McLaurin being out and Daniels back. Samuel is due for a big game, and this is setup for him to succeed against Seattle in Week 9.\nWRs to Start\n                        Projections powered by\n                        \n

quarterback with seven catches for 63 yards on nine targets. This week, he gets Lamar Jackson (hamstring) back, and Flowers should go off against the Dolphins. With Jackson, Flowers scored at least 14.4 PPR points in three of his first four outings this season, and Flowers has top-10 upside in Week 9. He's faced the Dolphins once in his career and had three catches for 106 yards and a touchdown on three targets in Week 17 in 2023, so hopefully he can do something similar on Thursday night.\n

touchdown on six targets. He has now scored at least 15.8 PPR points in three of his past four games since Tyreek Hill (knee) was injured, and Waddle should have the chance for another solid outing in Week 9 against Baltimore. The Ravens have allowed six receivers to score at least 16.0 PPR points this season, including three in their past three games. Waddle should add to that total in this Thursday night showdown at home.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        LAC\n                    \n                         \n                        L.A.

Ladd McConkey should be considered the No. 1 Chargers receiver, and I would still start Quentin Johnston in three-receiver leagues. Oronde Gadsden II has become a significant factor as well, but Allen has at least seven targets in all but one game this year. Five receivers have got at least seven targets against the Titans this year, and all five have scored at least 13.9 PPR points. I'm expecting Allen to perform well in this matchup on the road.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        ARI\n                    \n                         \n                        Arizona\n                    \n                                            • #18\n                                            \n                                            Age: 23\n                                                                        • Experience: 2 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        DAL\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    DAL -2.5\n                                    O/U 54\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS WR\n                                \n                                32nd\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                13.7\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    WR RNK\n                                \n                                21st\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    24\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    40\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    396\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    2\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    10.8\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Harrison struggled in two games with Jacoby Brissett when Kyler Murray (foot) was out, combining for just four catches for 90 yards and no touchdowns on eight targets against Indianapolis and Green Bay prior to Arizona's bye in Week 8. Murray is back in Week 9 against the Cowboys, and Harrison should have the chance for a big game in this matchup. Dallas is No. 1 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing receivers, and the Cowboys lead the NFL with 15 touchdowns allowed to receivers. Eight receivers have scored at least 15.2 PPR points against Dallas, and this should be one of Harrison's best Fantasy games of the season in Week 9.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        CAR\n                    \n                         \n                        Carolina\n                    \n                                            • #4\n                                            \n                                            Age: 22\n                                                                        • Experience: Rookie\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        GB\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    GB -13.5\n                                    O/U 44.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS WR\n                                \n                                22nd\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                11.2\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    WR RNK\n                                \n                                17th\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    37\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    63\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    512\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    2\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    12.5\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Bryce Young (ankle) appears on track to return for the Panthers, which makes McMillan worth trusting as a No. 2 Fantasy receiver in the majority of leagues. McMillan actually played well with Andy Dalton in Week 8 against Buffalo with seven catches for 99 yards on 10 targets, and I like the matchup for McMillan against Green Bay. The Packers have allowed at least 16.5 PPR points to three No. 1 receivers in the past four games (George Pickens in Week 4, Ja'Marr Chase in Week 6 and DK Metcalf in Week 8). I'm hopeful that McMillan will follow suit, and he should be considered a solid No. 2 Fantasy receiver in the majority of leagues.\n            \n            \n\nSleepers (Start/Sit)\n

Chiefs, Worthy has struggled with a combined eight catches for 88 yards and no touchdowns on 11 targets. We'll see if he can get going in Week 9 against the Bills, but Worthy should only be considered a No. 3 Fantasy receiver at best in the majority of leagues. The Bills are No. 11 in fewest Fantasy points allowed to receivers, but this isn't about the matchup so much as it is the targets. Rice has taken away all the momentum from Worthy since coming back.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        GB\n                    \n                         \n                        Green Bay\n                    \n                                            • #87\n                                            \n                                            Age: 25\n                                                                        • Experience: 4 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        CAR\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    GB -13.5\n                                    O/U 44.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS WR\n                                \n                                2nd\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                12\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    WR RNK\n                                \n                                33rd\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    27\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    42\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    350\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    4\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    12.6\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Christian Watson made his 2025 debut in Week 8 at Pittsburgh, and Doubs saw his fewest targets (six) since Week 3. He finished with three catches for 44 yards against the Steelers, and Doubs should be a No. 3 Fantasy receiver at best in Week 9 against the Panthers. Doubs also hasn't scored a touchdown since Week 4, and Carolina is No. 3 in fewest Fantasy points allowed to opposing receivers. Heading into Week 9, I would start Watson ahead of Doubs, and Doubs ahead of Matthew Golden, who also should be on the bench in the majority of leagues.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        DET\n                    \n                         \n                        Detroit\n                    \n                                            • #1\n                                            \n                                            Age: 24\n                                                                        • Experience: 4 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        MIN\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    DET -8.5\n                                    O/U 48.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS WR\n                                \n                                7th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                9.8\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    WR RNK\n                                \n                                42nd\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    17\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    30\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    289\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    2\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    8.3\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                It's always risky to sit Williams at home, but he failed to score a Fantasy point in Week 7 against Tampa Bay in Detroit with only two targets.

He also has scored at least 14.5 PPR points in two of his past four games heading into Week 9 at the Rams. But with the quarterback switch to Tyler Shough, as well as a tough matchup against the Rams, I would only start Shaheed in deep three-receiver leagues. He only has two touchdowns on the season, and Shough could be running for his life in his first NFL start on the road. As for Chris Olave, I would still start him in all formats, but lower expectations for him in his first full game with Shough.\n            \n            \n\nBust AlertSleepers (Start/Sit)\n

has scored 10.7 PPR points or less in two of his past three games coming into Week 9 at Houston, and he hasn't scored a touchdown since Week 4. Now, he has to face a Texans defense that is No. 4 in fewest Fantasy points allowed to opposing receivers, and Sutton will likely see a lot of Houston cornerback Derek Stingley Jr. I don't expect Sutton to get completely shut down, but he's more of a No. 3 Fantasy receiver in the majority of leagues in this matchup on the road.\n            \n            \n\n            \n    \n\n        \n\n

    "body": "\n        LSU will conduct its second coaching search in four years after firing Brian Kelly last weekend. Don't expect the person who helped poach Kelly from Notre Dame in 2021 to make the next hire. Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry told reporters Wednesday that the LSU Board of Supervisors will form a committee to find the school's next coach, rather than leaving the decision to athletic director Scott Woodward.\"We are not going down a failed path,\" Landry said. \"And I wanted to tell you something. This is a pattern. The guy that wrote [Kelly's] contract cost Texas A&M $70-something million. We have a $53 million liability. I believe that we are going to find a great coach … the board of supervisors are going to come up with a committee and they're going to find us a coach.\"While taking decision-making power away from Woodward makes sense given his recent track record, there was one issue with Landry's proclamation that the Board of Supervisors would be running the search. Scott Ballard, the board's chairman, was unaware of that plan.\"No, I didn't know that,\" Ballard told WBRZ.\"The next steps are we're gonna hire the best coach for Louisiana State University,\" Ballard continued. \"I promise you. Go Tigers.\"\nWoodward has been responsible for two of the largest buyouts in college football history. Before arriving at LSU in 2019, he orchestrated one of the sport's most stunning hires as Texas A&M's athletic director, landing Jimbo Fisher from Florida State.The Fisher era at Texas A&M fell short of expectations, and the school fired him before the conclusion of the 2023 season. Fisher had signed a 10-year, $95 million extension in 2021, leaving Texas A&M on the hook for a buyout exceeding $76 million.Kelly is also due a massive payout following last weekend's loss to Texas A&M. His 10-year contract, signed in 2021, paid him $9.4 million this season and still had six years and $58.2 million remaining. His buyout calls for 90% of the remaining salary, totaling $52.38 million.\nThe upcoming coaching carousel is expected to be full of movement, with LSU likely at the center. SportsLine oddsmakers list Ole Miss' Lane Kiffin, Tulane's Jon Sumrall, and Buffalo Bills offensive coordinator Joe Brady -- who held the same role at LSU during its 2019 national title season -- as names to watch in the search.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        San Francisco 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy has only played two games this season due to turf toe but has a chance to return this weekend when his team faces the New York Giants on the road. Purdy last played on Sept. 28, with Mac Jones taking over the starting QB duties while Purdy has been sidelined.49ers coach Kyle Shanahan on Monday expressed some optimism that Purdy could be back in the lineup on Sunday, but said the team would learn more at Wednesday's practice. Once Wednesday rolled around, Purdy was again a limited participant.Purdy initially injured the toe in Week 1, but was able to return for Week 4 -- only to re-aggravate the injury. So what does Purdy need to show in order to return to the field? Shanahan said it's confidence. \"If he gets out there, and he's hobbling around and stuff, he won't be out there [on Sunday]. So he's got to go out there and go through the practices and stuff and really let us know how good he feels because it's hard to know what's going on with the toe,\" Shanahan told reporters. \"They're really iffy things. Last time, we felt like he was feeling pretty good, looked pretty good in practice and then in the game, one hit and it set him back five or six weeks, whatever this has been ... four weeks.\"\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 9 injury report: Lamar Jackson good to go for Ravens, Bryce Young returns to practice\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe team wants Purdy, who signed a five-year, $265 million extension in May, to avoid another setback, but Shanahan noted it's not easy to detect whether one is coming, \n\"It's kind of a sensitive situation and hopefully getting some reps in practice and stuff will give him that confidence that it's better than it was last time,\" Shanahan said. When asked if Purdy will let them know by the end of the week if he feels good enough to play, Shanahan quipped, \"I mean, I didn't give him a deadline.\"\"It's not as black and white as you guys want it to be\" the coach added.\nJones is dealing with a knee contusion but was a full participant in Wednesday's practice. He will get yet another start if Purdy is unable to go as the 49ers (5-3) look to bounce back from last week's 26-15 loss to the Houston Texans. \n            ",

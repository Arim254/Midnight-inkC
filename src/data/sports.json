There is also a full slate of college basketball games during the opening day of the season, including No. 13 Arizona vs. No. 3 Florida and No. 8 BYU vs. Villanova. The Cardinals are on a five-game losing streak, so SportsLine's proven computer model is backing the Cowboys to cover the spread as 3-point favorites. It has also revealed its college basketball best bets. Claim the latest bet365 bonus code here:Check out our bet365 promo code review for full details.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every NFL game 10,000 times. The model enters Week 9 on a sizzling 45-28 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. The model also simulates every Division 1 college basketball game 10,000 times. It finished last season on a 229-169 roll (+1805) on all top-rated college basketball picks dating back to 2023.

Bet it at bet365 here:\nCowboys -3 vs. CardinalsDallas has not lost back-to-back games all season, and two of those bounce-back wins came at home following losses the previous week. The Cowboys cruised to a 44-22 win over the Commanders two weeks ago, and they are facing a Cardinals team that is on a five-game losing streak. Quarterback Kyler Murray is not going to start on Monday after being limited all week in practice due to a foot injury. SportsLine's model trusts Dallas to bounce back, as the Cowboys are winning by four points in the latest simulations. Bet it at bet365 here:  Under 163.5 points in Florida vs. ArizonaFlorida returns to the spotlight immediately after winning the national championship last season, bringing a 12-game winning streak into its opener. The Gators lost some serious firepower from last year's team, including star guard Walter Clayton Jr., Alijah Martin and Will Richard. Head coach Todd Golden is having to replace more than 45 points per game along with Clayton's 4.2 assists per game. Arizona lost guard Caleb Love, so the model has the Under cashing 58% of the time. Bet it at bet365 here:  Villanova +9 vs. BYUBYU enters the season with sky-high expectations, as it is coming off its first Sweet 16 appearance since 2011 and brought in star freshman AJ Dybantsa. However, this is a tough opening game against a Villanova program that is led by first-year head coach Kevin Willard, who led Maryland to the NCAA Tournament twice in three seasons. The Wildcats were able to get some valuable preseason experience in exhibition games against VCU and Virginia, and the model has them covering in 66% of simulations. Bet it at bet365 here:  \nLooking for more NFL picks?You've seen the model's best bets for Monday.

Dallas hosts Arizona in a crucial NFC matchup at 8:15 p.m. ET, with the Cardinals trying to snap a five-game losing streak. SportsLine's proven computer model is backing the Over (53.5) in that game since the Cowboys have the second-highest scoring offense in the NFL. The model also likes the Under (163.5) in No. 3 Florida vs. No. 13 Arizona and is backing No. 7 Michigan to cover as a 24.5-point favorite against Oakland.

Quarterback Dak Prescott has racked up 2,069 passing yards and 16 passing touchdowns, while running back Javonte Williams has eight rushing scores. The Cowboys have also been leaky defensively, giving up the second-most points per game (31.3). This adds up to high-scoring games, and the model has the Over cashing in 53% of simulations on Monday night. Bet on the NFL at FanDuel Sportsbook:Under 163.5 in Florida vs. ArizonaFlorida is coming off its third title in school history, but it lost three players to the NBA in Walter Clayton Jr., Alijah Martin and Will Richard. The Gators are having to replace more than 45 points per game, but they still have three elite big men to anchor their defense. Arizona lost leading scorer Caleb Love, so a slow start offensively would not be surprising on either side. The model has the Under hitting 58% of the time in this early-season showdown. Bet on college basketball at FanDuel Sportsbook:Michigan -24.5 vs. OaklandMichigan enters the season as the No. 7-ranked team in college basketball after bringing in several high-profile transfers following its Big Ten Tournament title and Sweet 16 run last season. Potential NBA lottery pick Yaxel Lendeborg joins Aday Mara and Morez Johnson in the frontcourt, while North Carolina transfer Elliot Cadeau headlines the backcourt. Oakland is dealing with significant roster turnover and wants to play at a faster pace this season, which means the score could get out of hand even earlier on Monday.

    "body": "\n        Available for Maryland users only, Crab Sports is fairly new to the sports betting market in the state, having obtained its license to operate in 2023.

The player can win up to a $500 profit if their first straight, parlay, or Same Game Parlay (SGP) wager hits.

Sign up here:How does the Crab Sports promo compare to other sports betting app bonus offers?Crab Sports offers a competitive initial offer for Maryland residents, giving new users the chance to win up to $500 in cash with a successful first bet. Here's how their offer stacks up against the best sportsbook promos from around the industry.SportsbookBonus OfferPromo CodeCrab Sports100% profit boost on first bet up to $500CBSSPORTSDraftKingsBet $5, get $300 in bonus bets if your first bet wins + 3 Months of NBA League PassNone requiredFanDuelBet $5, get $150 in bonus bets if your first bet winsNone requiredFanaticsBet and get up to $2,000 in No Sweat Bets FanCashNone requiredBetMGMUp to $1500 in bonus bets if your first bet losesCBSSPORTSCaesarsBet $1, double your winnings next 20 betsCBS20Xbet365Bet $5, get $200 in bonus bets win or loseCBSBET365ESPNBetBet $10, get $100 in bonus betsNone requiredTypes of welcome promosFanDuel and DraftKings offer bet and get offers where the customer must win the first wager to receive the bonus bets (which expire after seven days). bet365 and ESPNBet offer similar bet and get welcome bonuses but the player will receive their bonus bets from each regardless of the outcome of their initial wager.BetMGM's offer of a no sweat bet up to $1500 essentially gives the customer a do-over if their first bet loses. However, the no sweat bet is paid in bonus bets so if that second bet hits, the player will not receive the stake, only the winnings.Crab Sports' introductory offer most resembles Caesars, where a 100% profit boost is available to new customers. The difference is that Caesars offers 20 100% profit boosts (with a max. stake of $25 each) while Crab Sports gives new users one chance to go big up to $500.How to sign up for Crab Sports and claim the promo codeThose looking to sign up for CrabSports and claim this offer can follow these outlined steps:1.   Click on the link in this article to begin the process.2.   Click the SIGNUP button to start registration.3.   Fill in your personal details including name, email, address, and date of birth.4.   The next screen will ask for your address and last four digits of your social security number.5.   When prompted on the third screen, enter Crab Sports promo code CBSSPORTS.6.   Configure 2 Factor Authentication.7.   Make your first deposit. You can use the various deposit methods including debit card, credit card, or bank transfer.8.   Place your first wager up to $500 to redeem your 100% profit boost. How to place a bet on Crab SportsPlacing a straight wager is relatively straightforward on Crab Sports, with the user needing to click on the sport, game, and market of their choosing before selecting the dollar amount and placing the bet. For parlays and round robins, tabs appear in the betting slip making this process easy. For SGPs, it's a bit trickier compared to most other sportsbooks. A user must click on the game of choice, followed by the Same Game Parlay option, select multiple plays, and click Add to Betslip before placing the wager. Multiple SGPs are able to be combined into parlays. Get started now:Crab Sports promo and bonuses for existing usersLike most sportsbooks, Crab Sports features promotions for existing users that can enhance the value of their bets. With both profit boosts and no sweat options, there is plenty for Maryland users to enjoy after the initial welcome bonus.Best Crab Sports promos this weekEvery day SGP 50% bet insurance – users can place a $50 or greater bet on a three-or-more-leg SGP (+500 odds or longer). If that first eligible bet each day loses, the player will receive a 50% free bet up to $50. This promotion is unique to Crab Sports on a daily basis and most sportsbooks will offer a similar promotion occasionally at best.Crab Parlay Boost – With qualifying bets, a percentage boost will be added for each leg of the parlay up to 50% for the 15th leg.Social giveaway – Players who win the Crab Sports social media giveaway will receive a $25 Lottery Ticket Free Bet that must be used within four days of issuance.Refer a friend – New referrals and those who refer a friend will each receive a $10 Lottery Ticket Free Bet upon using a unique code given by the existing member.Deposit matchesOccasionally, sportsbooks offer deposit matches in which the user must deposit a required amount or more before receiving additional funds via cash or bonus bets. Most sportsbooks will require the deposit + bonus amount to be wagered before requesting a withdrawal. For Crab Sports, after the first bet, all cash winnings may be withdrawn as any no sweat bets aren't considered cash.No Sweat Bet tokensUsers can apply a token where if the selected bet loses, the player will get a refund in the form of a free bet, which is not redeemable for cash.Boosted OddsGenerally two leg Same Game Parlays where the sportsbook will enhance the odds to make it more enticing to bettors.Profit boosts / SGP profit boostsLike most sportsbooks, Crab Sports offers profit boosts for parlays and occasionally straight wagers. Some profit boosts incentivize adding more legs to the parlay for a greater boost.Crab Sports user experienceThe user experience at Crab Sports is friendly as the sportsbook relies on a simplistic design where the odds pop due to a different color scheme than the rest of the text. The menus are easy to follow and choosing a sport or game is no more difficult than at any other sportsbook. User InterfaceThe design of the site is appealing with several variations of blue mixed with a grey color scheme, with black, white, and blue text. I like that the odds pop on the site, with a larger font and navy-blue text against a grey background. While the design looks a bit antiquated compared to the national competition, I can't say that it's a deterrent by any means from playing on the site.Crab Sports Home Screen LayoutOn desktop, the home screen features rotating banners with promotions and top games for that night. Live betting is prominently featured in the center with the games from around the world currently in play. On the left side, Links, Popular, and All Sports give the user plenty of menu options, as does a bar with each sport's icon towards the top. The My Selections tab on the right is visible throughout so you can see which picks you have selected. Overall, Crab Sports provides a clean look and is easily navigable on computers.On mobile, the home screen shows the sport icons at the very top, followed by rotating banners, and the live games. The menus at the bottom include Home, A-Z Sports, an icon to view your selections, Live, and My Bets. Once again, a very clean design for users and easy to navigate for both new and experienced players.Sportsbook app design, speed, functionalitySimilar to the desktop site, the odds pop on the app with larger navy-blue text against a lighter background. The functionality works similarly to the desktop site and lag doesn't seem to be an issue in my testing. But it's hard to compare Crab Sports' app to the feature-rich national brands such as DraftKings and FanDuel.For players who know what they want to bet when coming to the site, Crab Sports provides a fine experience. But if you're looking to browse random odds and categories, you have to go game-by-game at Crab Sports vs. menu items showing all games on several other sites.Geolocation issues can be common on any sportsbook app but in most cases has not been a major complaint of Crab Sports customers thus far.

When it comes to props though, the selections are much fewer compared to the larger sportsbooks, which allow more customization as compared to just over/under a set yardage or hits total for example.The Same Game Parlay builder seems like a first-generation version of what we see on the likes of DraftKings, FanDuel, and Fanatics now and can be tedious. You must click on the builder before adding SGP picks which is a feature of the past on most books. There have been customer reviews stating that live betting cashout offers don't compare favorably to most other sportsbooks, with early cashout offers seemingly lower than other books.Crab Sports key betting featuresCrab Sports offers many of the same betting features found in most apps including:Early CashoutWhile its offers are not as financially friendly as some of the larger sportsbooks, Crab Sports does offer the ability for users to get out of eligible bets before their conclusion with a profit or loss.Live BettingCrab Sports gives Maryland users the opportunity to bet during just about any sporting event while in progress. Odds changes are easy to note with green and red arrows upon any line movement.SGP generationNot only can users create SGPs, they may parlay multiple SGPs, albeit each one must be created separately. For eligible games, a Same Game Parlay button appears which must be selected before options are chosen.How to track your bets on Crab SportsOn desktop, the My Selection tab on the right side of the page makes it easy to follow along with your bets. The My Bets tab allows you to view your existing wagers. On the app, the icon of a ticket in the center at the bottom makes it easy for players to make their selections. To track selections on the app, My Bets on the bottom right is the place to click.Crab Sports customer supportIn addition to comprehensive help, rules, and FAQ pages, users with an issue may email support@crabsports.com, with the response time usually within an hour or two. Crab Sports does not feature a live chat as most other sportsbooks offer.Betting on Maryland sports teamsCrab Sports is a sportsbook exclusively for Maryland sports bettors. All championship odds are for the 2025-26 seasons and from Crab Sports (updated 10/10/25).Baltimore Ravens (NFL) (+1700)With superstars (quarterback) Lamar Jackson and (running back) Derrick Henry, the Ravens were expected to be a Super Bowl contender again in 2025. Baltimore seeks its third Super Bowl title, having won in the 2001 and 2013 seasons. As long as Jackson is healthy and leading Baltimore, the Ravens should remain a threat in the AFC playoffs.Washington Commanders (NFL) (+1900)Led 2024 Offensive Rookie of the Year, QB Jayden Daniels, Washington D.C.'s team is capable of making another sustained run in the playoffs. Daniels looks like an elite quarterback as he was projected to be after winning the Heisman Trophy in college.Washington Wizards (NBA) (+49900)As the team with the worst odds to win it all per Crab Sports, this doesn't appear to be a year of promise for the rebuilding Wizards franchise.Baltimore Orioles (MLB) (2026 odds: TBD)At 75-87, the Orioles finished last in the American League East Division, which produced three playoff teams. They will look to bounce back in 2026 with a young core including shortstop Gunnar Henderson and second baseman Jackson Holliday.Washington Nationals (MLB) (2026 odds: TBD)The 2019 World Series champions are in rebuilding mode for the next few years, as evidenced by a 66-96 campaign in 2025. Outfielder James Wood is the team's brightest star with some additional promising prospects in need of more MLB seasoning.Washington Capitals (NHL) (+2900)The NHL's all-time leading goal scorer, Alex Ovechkin, looks to close out his career in style, adding a second Stanley Cup championship to his resume. Washington most recently won sports' greatest trophy in 2017.Crab Sports responsible gaming toolsAt the bottom of the page on both desktop and mobile, users can click on the Responsible Gambling section.The sections on that page's FAQ include:How to play responsiblyWhat is Problem Gambling?What support is available?What tools can you use to manage your gambling?Voluntary ExclusionUnderage GamblingLinks on the page for gambling help resources include:MD Gambling HelpMD Problem GamblingMD LotteryMaryland State Lottery & Gaming Control AgencyNational Council on Problem GamblingGamblers AnonymousGam-AnonInternational Center for Responsible Gaming988 Suicide & Crising Lifeline Crab Sports banking methodsCrab Sports offers a number of ways for customers to deposit and withdraw money.Deposit methodsThese deposit methods are available for most users.Quick deposit methodsFeesProcess timeMin. depositOnline Banking (via Plaid)$0Instant$10Debit Card (VISA, Mastercard, Discover)$0Instant$10Credit Card ((VISA, Mastercard, Discover)$0Instant$10Withdrawal methodsHere are the primary ways to withdraw money at Crab Sports.Withdrawal optionProcess TimeMax withdrawalOnline Banking (via Plaid)1-2 business daysUnknownDebit Card (VISA, Mastercard, Discover)1-2 business daysUnknownCrab Sports review: Final verdictFor Maryland users, Crab Sports is a fine alternative to the national sportsbooks. The design is simplistic but the interface is easy to use. If you're looking for the bells and whistles of additional menus, a search function, and more individual player betting options, then this isn't the right sportsbook for you. But if you're located in the state and want to take advantage of the generous signup offer, Crab Sports is worth a long look.The app works well and betting pregame or during the live action is easy. Betting SGPs is slower than at other sportsbooks, but at least it is still possible. There are limited options for deposits / withdrawals and the customer support is only via email. This sportsbook does not offer a rewards program as of now. Nonetheless, I recommend giving Crab Sports a shot if you're in Maryland.Honest feedback for how Crab Sports can improveEnhance Same Game Parlay betting: Compared to other sportsbooks, betting SGPs is slow. Clicking on multiple lines / props from the same game should automatically trigger an SGP, whereas now it only works if you press a specific button.Offer more menus for betting selected markets: Similar to BetMGM who also falls short in this category, Crab Sports should create menus so users don't have to click on each game separately to add a certain market.More deposit and withdrawal options: It seems almost standard that options such as PayPal and Venmo, which allow seamless money transfers, should be allowed at every sportsbook. This is a necessary addition in due time for Crab Sports.Crab Sports FAQHow do you get the Crab Sports promo?Use promo code CBSSPORTS on the third page of the registration screen and deposit up to $500 to receive a 100% profit boost on your first wager.How long do Crab Sports withdrawals take?Generally 1-2 business days, if not faster for withdrawals via debit card and online banking.Can you cash out bonus bets on Crab Sports?No, all bonus bets must be played through before attempting to redeem them for cash.How do you contact Crab Sports?Email support@crabsports.com with any questions or inquiries.Do you need a promo code for Crab Sports?Yes, use promo code CBSSPORTS when initially signing up.Does Crab Sports have a good rewards program?To date, there has been no mention of a rewards program for Crab Sports.Where is Crab Sports available?You may only play on Crab Sports if you're physically located in Maryland and are 21 years of age or older.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        NFC squads looking to crawl their way back into the postseason picture will meet in Week 9 of 'Monday Night Football' when the Dallas Cowboys host the Arizona Cardinals. Dallas (3-4-1) is undefeated at home but enters off a 44-24 defeat at Denver last Sunday. Arizona (2-5) has the NFL's longest losing streak at five games and fell to Green Bay, 27-23, in Week 7 before having a bye last week. Jacoby Brissett will remain the starting quarterback for Arizona in place of the still recovering Kyler Murray (foot), according to coach Jonathan Gannon. Though he won't start, Murray is questionable to be active as a backup.Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. Arizona has won seven of the last eight meetings between the teams, including three straight on the road. Dallas is the 3.5-point favorite in the latest Cardinals vs. Cowboys odds, while the over/under for total points scored is 54.

The Cards have won both three straight overall against the Cowboys as well as each of their last three trips to Dallas. Arizona's spread record has mirrored its outright record in these eight contests as the Cardinals have covered in seven of the eight. Despite a five-game losing streak this season, Arizona has covered in back-to-back contests, while Dallas is coming off both a straight-up and spread defeat.The Cardinals can take advantage of Dallas' porous defense on Monday as the Cowboys rank second-worst in points allowed, yards allowed and passing defense. Dallas is dead last in third-down defense, which plays into Arizona's strength as the latter ranks fifth in third-down offense. Plus, having Brissett under center isn't much of a downgrade for the team as the journeyman has back-to-back games with two touchdown passes against a pair of one-loss teams in Green Bay and Indianapolis, so he should find success versus the Cowboys. See which team to back at SportsLine.New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states:Why the Cowboys can coverFew teams can match the offensive firepower of Dallas, which leads the NFL in passing offense, ranks second in points scored and is also second in total yards gained. Dak Prescott leads the league in QBR while running back, Javonte Williams, ranks among the top four in both rushing yards and rushing touchdowns. George Pickens is third in both receiving yards and receiving touchdowns, while No. 1 wideout, CeeDee Lamb, has 184 yards and a score in his two games since returning from injury.While Arizona coming off a bye would seemingly help its chances of winning, it may not help its chances of covering. The Cardinals have lost each of their last three games versus the spread after a bye, and they are 2-5 ATS with a rest advantage since 2022. Meanwhile, the Cowboys have a knack for rising to the occasion when an opponent has an advantageous schedule. Dallas is 6-2 ATS when at a rest disadvantage since the start of the 2022 season. See which team to back at SportsLine. Check out the latest BetMGM promo code CBSSPORTS, where new users can get up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses.How to make Cowboys vs. Cardinals picksFor Cardinals vs. Cowboys   on 'Monday Night Football,' the model is leaning Over the total, projecting 56 combined points.

    "body": "\n        Prior to the bye week, Justin Fields led the New York Jets to their first win of the 2025 season. Despite that performance, coach Aaron Glenn isn't committing to Fields as the Week 10 starter, at least not publicly.During his Monday press conference, Glenn was asked who would start against the Cleveland Browns. In what has become a weekly trend, Glenn declined to say whether Fields or Tyrod Taylor would get the starting nod.\"You know I'm not gonna give you that answer,\" Glenn said. \"You'll find out soon who our starting quarterback will be. Justin did a hell of a job against Cincinnati, but you know I'm gonna keep that close to the vest.\"Glenn explained that he has his \"own reasons\" for refusing to announce a starting quarterback. The Jets coach also dismissed the notion that Fields' confidence could be damaged by Glenn not announcing the starting quarterback publicly.\"It helps the quarterback's confidence when the player and coach talk, and they know who the guy is, not that I'm telling it to you guys,\" Glenn said. \"That has nothing to do with the player's confidence.\"\nIn Fields' last start, which was a 39-38 win over the Bengals, he threw for 244 yards and a touchdown while picking up 31 yards on the ground. It was New York's best offensive game of the season to this point, and it resulted in their only win.So, what message would it send to the 1-7 Jets if Taylor started over Fields after that outing? Glenn had an interesting response to that question.\"That is nothing for you to worry about, isn't it?\" Glenn replied.Glenn has been keeping his starting quarterback decisions under wraps for several weeks now, but Fields has started every game but one. In his seven starts, Fields has completed 64.1% of his throws for 1,089 yards, five touchdowns and no interceptions. He has also rushed for 288 yards.\nTaylor has been battling a knee injury, but Glenn said he expects the veteran to resume practicing this week. Taylor has appeared in three games with one start under his belt, and he's completed 62.3% of his passes for 379 yards, three touchdowns and three interceptions.\n            ",

The Chiefs Week 9 loss to the Buffalo Bills moved the defending AFC champions down a spot in the playoff picture, to No. 8. Only seven teams from each conference reach the postseason.Despite being outside of the playoff bubble, the Chiefs are still among the favorites to not just make Super Bowl LX, but win it all. Kansas City's recent history of success is enough to make bettors believe in the team, even with an uncharacteristic start.The Chiefs have the second-highest odds (+330) of making the Super Bowl and have the second-highest odds (+650) hoisting the Lombardi Trophy, per DraftKings Sportsbook. Only the Bills carry higher odds of winning the conference championship (+290) and winning the Super Bowl (+600).The Chiefs have better odds of winning the championship than the 6-2 Los Angeles Rams (+800), 5-3 Detroit Lions (+900), 5-2-1 Green Bay Packers (+950) and defending Super Bowl champions, the 6-2 Philadelphia Eagles (+1000).\nIf the season ended today, Indianapolis holds the No. 1 seed, followed by the New England Patriots and Denver Broncos. SeedTeamNo. 1Indianapolis Colts (7-2)No. 2New England Patriots (7-2)No. 3Denver Broncos (7-2)No. 4Pittsburgh Steelers (5-3)No. 5Buffalo Bills (6-2)No. 6Los Angeles Chargers (6-3)No. 7Jacksonville Jaguars (5-3)The Chiefs sit at 5-4 and third in the AFC West, behind the 7-2 Denver Broncos and 6-3 Los Angeles Chargers. Kansas City's next few games are not easy. They are on a bye this week and will return in Week 11 to face the Broncos at Mile High, before hosting the Colts and heading to AT&T Stadium to play the Dallas Cowboys. \nThis year's Super Bowl will be played at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, home of the San Francisco 49ers. Will the Chiefs be there? The odds are in their favor.\n            \n    ",

This marks the second straight year Stefanski has done this, as he relinquished play-calling duties to Ken Dorsey last year.\"We have to be better,\" Stefanski said, via Fox8News. \"Tommy is somebody I believe in. This is the right time.\"Stefanski came to this decision during the Browns' Week 9 bye, which came after the 32-13 loss to the New England Patriots last Sunday. Cleveland has lost 12 straight road games, and seven straight road games by at least 13 points.\nOnce again, the Browns have one of the worst offenses in the league, as they average 263.5 total yards per game (second-worst in the NFL) and 15.8 points per game (third-worst in the NFL). Cleveland swapped quarterbacks in Week 5, benching Joe Flacco for rookie Dillon Gabriel. In four starts (1-3), Gabriel has completed 59.4% of his passes while averaging 170.8 passing yards per game with four passing touchdowns and two interceptions. Rees has been on staff with the Browns for two years, serving as Stefanski's pass game specialist and tight ends coach in 2024 before being promoted to offensive coordinator. The former Notre Dame quarterback previously served as the offensive coordinator at his alma mater and the University of Alabama. \nThe two-time NFL Coach of the Year is now 42-50 as lead man in Cleveland, and looking to spark his team. The change in play caller didn't lead to success last year, as the Browns went 3-14 and lost their last six games. \n            \n    ",

The move means that Kapler will now be the club's second-ranking executive in baseball operations under president of baseball operations Peter Bendix. In other front office moves, the Marlins also announced that Frankie Piliere has been elevated to vice president of amateur forecasting and player evaluation initiatives and Vinesh Kanthan has been promoted to senior director of baseball operations.\"These three leaders have each made a meaningful impact since joining our team, exemplifying the values that define our culture: driving innovation across every area of the team, leading with a forward-thinking mindset and elevating those around them as great teammates,\" Bendix said in a statement. \"Their advancement is a testament to the caliber of talent and person within our organization and our continued commitment to building a culture of collaboration and excellence.\"\nKapler, 50, has spent the past two seasons in the assistant GM role for the Marlins. As a player, he spent parts of 12 seasons in MLB as an outfielder, including with the Tampa Bay Rays from 2009-10, when Bendix was in the team's front office. After his playing days, Kapler most notably served as manager of the Philadelphia Phillies from 2018-19 and the San Francisco Giants from 2020-23. Over those six seasons as a big-league manager, Kapler compiled a record of 456-411. In 2021, he guided the Giants to 107 wins and a National League West title before being eliminated by the rival Dodgers in the NLDS.\"It is an exciting time to be part of the Marlins' organization, and I am ready to continue the great work we are doing here, alongside Peter and our entire baseball operations staff,\" Kapler said in a statement. \"The growth and momentum we've built are a direct reflection of a clear vision, a strong culture and an incredible team working together toward a shared goal. I'm proud to help continue that progress and contribute to what's ahead.\"\nAs for the Marlins, they've endured losing seasons in four of the last five years. In 2025, however, they improved their win total by 17 games over their 100-loss season in 2024. The Marlins this offseason face a number of questions, most notably about whether or not to trade Sandy Alcantara.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The National Baseball Hall of Fame on Monday released the Contemporary Baseball Era Committee ballot for 2026 induction, and among the eight names are firebrand candidates Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens. In addition to Bonds and Clemens, this year's Era Committee ballot also includes Carlos Delgado, Jeff Kent, Don Mattingly, Dale Murphy, Gary Sheffield, and the late Fernando Valenzuela. The Contemporary Era for these purposes covers players whose primary contribution to the game came since 1980. Here's a quick rundown of each of the eight candidates named above: Barry Bonds: One of the greatest players in baseball history, Bonds is the all-time leader in home runs (762), and his career WAR of 162.8 ranks fourth all-time. Bonds is a seven-time MVP who failed to be elected via the BBWAA ballot -- the more conventional path for election -- only because of allegations of performance-enhancing drug use. \nRoger Clemens: Clemens won 354 games in his career and has seven Cy Young awards and an MVP to his credit. He also racked up 4,672 strikeouts and a WAR of 138.7. Like Bonds, Clemens is an inner-circle all-time great whose associations with PED use prevented him from earning election on the writers' ballot. Carlos Delgado: One of the greatest players ever to come out of Puerto Rico, Delgado in his career hit 473 home runs, earned a pair of All-Star selections, and authored a career WAR of 44.4. Don Mattingly: He was a skilled craftsman at the plate whose career was undone by injuries. Mattingly was a nine-time Gold Glove winner and an MVP who amassed 2,153 hits in his career and a WAR of 42.4. Mattingly also managed for 12 seasons and during that span guided the Dodgers to three division titles and the Marlins to a postseason berth in the COVID-abbreviated 2020 season. \nDale Murphy: A two-time MVP and one of the most beloved players of his era, Murphy was also a seven-time All-Star and a five-time Gold Glover winner in center field. He retired from playing with a career WAR of 46.5. Gary Sheffield: Perhaps this ballot's strongest candidate after Bonds and Clemens, Sheffield boasts a career OPS+ of 140; 509 home runs; 2,689 hits; 1,475 walks; and a WAR of 60.5 across parts of 22 MLB seasons. Sheffield also earned nine All-Star selections in his career and won five Silver Slugger awards. Sheffield has previously admitted to using PEDs during his playing career. Fernando Valenzuela: One of the most beloved figures in Dodgers history and the greatest player ever to come out of Mexico, Valenzuela has to his credit a Cy Young award, a career WAR of 37.3, and the phenomenon of \"Fernandomania\" in the early 1980s. After his retirement, Valenzuela was a popular Spanish-language color commentator on Dodgers television broadcasts. Valenzuela died in October 2024, mere days shy of his 64th birthday. \nThe 16-member Hall of Fame Board-appointed electorates who will vote on the eight names above will be announced later this fall. A candidate must be named on 75% of ballots, or 12 ballots in this instance, to earn election. The results of the Committee vote will be announced on Sunday, Dec. 7, at the outset of baseball's Winter Meetings. Players elected will be inducted into Cooperstown next summer.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Atlanta Falcons coach Raheem Morris had some interesting things to say on Sunday after watching his team go down in a tight 24-23 loss to the New England Patriots. During his postgame press conference, Morris essentially accused the Patriots of cheating by implying that they illegally simulated the Falcons' snap count on a key drive that came late in the fourth quarter of the game. With 2:09 left to play, the Falcons were trailing 24-23 and sitting at New England's 48-yard line. On a second-and-10 play, center Ryan Neuzil sent a snap back to Michael Penix Jr. that the QB wasn't ready for. The Patriots quickly rushed Penix and the QB didn't want to take a sack, so he quickly got rid of the ball and he ended up getting called for intentional grounding, which is a 10-yard penalty with a loss of down. So Atlanta's second-and-10 turned into a third-and-20 from its own 42. According to Morris, the only reason the bad snap happened is because the Patriots confused his center by simulating Atlanta's snap count. \"They did a nice job, they simulated a snap,\" Morris said. \"The ball came early, it was snapped early. Within that snap, that was when we got the intentional grounding.\"\nSimulating a snap is illegal in the NFL and it's a strong accusation, so Morris was asked to clarify that he was in fact accusing the Patriots of doing that. \"They were clapping. Simulated our snap, got us to snap the ball,\" Morris said. \"That's why the ball was snapped early to [Penix], and he wasn't ready for the snap.\"If a defense is caught simulating a snap count, that's known as a \"disconcerting signal\" and it's illegal under NFL rules. If you get flagged for that in a game, it's a 15-yard penalty. If a flag had been thrown, the Falcons would have gotten a first-and-10 at New England's 33-yard line.\nSo did the clapping actually happen? You can judge for yourself by checking out a video of the play below. \nHere are the two biggest takeaways from the replay: The nine Patriots defenders closest to the line of scrimmage definitely did NOT clap. If there was a clap, it came from Patriots safety Jaylinn Hawkins. Starting at the five-second mark, it appears that he's looking at the Patriots' sideline trying to get someone's attention. It's hard to tell if he actually clapped his hands, but Neuzil did snap the ball just as Hawkins stopped moving his hands. Falcons reactionPenix was asked about the clapping after the game and although he couldn't say with 100% certainty that it actually happened, he did say that Neuzil definitely heard clapping. \"Supposedly they were clapping,\" Penix said. \"For us, whenever I'm clapping, that means I want the ball. I knew [Neuzil] said he heard them clapping, and he thought it was my clap, and he snapped the ball. I threw the ball in [Kyle Pitts'] direction. He had just released on a route. I thought I was going to be okay with the grounding part. Obviously that wasn't the case.\"\nSo Neuzil definitely heard someone clapping, but he didn't know exactly where the clapping was coming from. Patriots deny all wrongdoingIf Neuzil heard some clapping, you'd think someone else on the field would have heard it, but that's not the case on New England's side. Patriots defensive tackle Milton Williams doesn't believe that anyone on his team was clapping. \"Who was clapping? Did it look like I was clapping?\" Williams said, via MassLive.com. \"I'm going to go watch and see who was clapping. I didn't hear no clapping. I'm looking at the ball. The ball moves, I'm gone.\"\nIf it was Hawkins -- and that's a big if -- he was lined up 12 to 13 yards off the line of scrimmage so it seems like a few other people would have heard his claps if Neuzil did. During a press conference on Monday, Patriots coach Vrabel was asked about the possibility that Hawkins may have been clapping his hands to try and mess up the Falcons' snap count and he dismissed that theory. \"That wasn't anybody's intent, and I don't think that we've ever coached that or talked about that,\" Vrabel said. \"I can't spend that much time focused on it. I did look at it briefly. I certainly didn't think that that was anything that we did -- I mean, I think it's pretty loud, guys are trying to get lined up and I'm glad that we took off when they snapped the ball.\"\nVrabel was also asked if he was annoyed about the fact that Morris was accusing his team of cheating. \"I don't think annoyed. I'm trying to not waste any more time looking for anybody clapping,\" the Patriots coach said. \"I don't see anything.\"With Morris making public accusations against the Patriots, the NFL will likely be looking into this and it will be very interesting to see what the league finds. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Since arriving in Utah with a breakout season in 2022-23, Lauri Markkanen has been one of the NBA's best stretch fours and the ninth-year pro is off to a sizzling start this season. Markkanen is averaging 33.0 points per game thus far and has scored 29 points or more in five consecutive games. However, his scoring average is inflated by a 51-point game against the Suns earlier in the year and he needed 28 shots to get to 29 points against the Hornets on Sunday. Now he'll be playing in the second game of a back-to-back against the Celtics, who will have a point to prove defensively after a blowout loss to the Rockets. With the latest NBA prop odds inflating Markkanen's over/under for total points to 26.5, the SportsLine Projection Model is targeting the Under (-125) as one of its top NBA player props on Monday.

    "description": "\n        There will now be plenty of time for Hugh Freeze to golf after Auburn fired him Sunday following an abysmal 15-19 record over three seasons. ",
    "body": "\n        There will now be plenty of time for Hugh Freeze to golf after Auburn fired him Sunday following an abysmal 15-19 record over three seasons. That might feel like a too easy, and frankly unoriginal, punchline about the now-fired Auburn football coach. But in talking to multiple sources within Auburn football and around the Auburn community, it is striking just how much Freeze seemed to prioritize his golf game over working to improve the Tigers' football program. Last season, for instance, he was spotted on the golf course multiple times on Sundays after losses the previous day.  After multiple stories about his affinity for golf came out this summer, Freeze seemed a bit more sheepish about being seen publicly playing golf during the season. He was sensitive about all the golf jokes -- he claimed publicly it didn't detract from his work -- and was particularly upset over comments Ole Miss head coach Lane Kiffin made. But he still couldn't help himself. On the Friday before a home game this season, Freeze again showed up to the golf course. As an Auburn booster told CBS Sports, \"Freeze just came out to the golf course without clubs to watch guys play golf.\"\nAs it became more and more clear that Freeze wasn't the right guy to right the ship at Auburn, there were naturally questions about why it didn't work. On paper, it seemed to make perfect sense for Freeze to succeed on the Plains. It was weird, though -- almost from the start -- and there were more and more whispers among staffers and boosters that Freeze had lost the mojo that made him an unequivocal success at Ole Miss and Liberty. He looked deflated and tired, even before a cancer prognosis this year, and didn't seem to have any real plan to fix things. \"The only problem we didn't foresee,\" one booster said, \"is that he wanted to play golf way more than coach anymore!\" ****Auburn will pay $15.8 million to make Freeze go away, the latest eight-figure payment the university has approved for a failed football coach. In just the last five years, that number totals more than $52 million. No Auburn coach has left on his own terms since 1975, despite at least one of them winning a national championship. \nFreeze had every resource and advantage available to him in ways his recent predecessors hadn't. Bryan Harsin never fit in at Auburn. The Boise native had won plenty at Boise State but quickly looked over-his-head in trying to navigate an insular community like Auburn. Harsin didn't understand the politics of the place, upset the wrong powerful boosters who preferred different coaching candidates and had the money spigot turned off in the early days of Name, Image and Likeness. By the time he figured out how important it was to have certain boosters on his side, it was too late and he was fired midway through his second season.After going outside the box to hire Harsin, Auburn went as inside the box as possible with Freeze. Never mind the fact Freeze had to resign from Ole Miss because of a \"pattern of conduct\" unbecoming of a head coach which included a dozen phone calls to escorts. Or that as Liberty's head coach he sent unsolicited messages to sexual assault survivors, including one embroiled in an active lawsuit against Liberty, defending his boss as the \"most Jesus like leader I have ever seen or been around but you take every chance you can to take a shot at him.\" \nIn a craven desire to be relevant again, Auburn valued Freeze's two wins over Nick Saban and Alabama over the litany of red flags that followed him everywhere he went. It wasn't like Auburn leaders were unaware either, even hiring a crisis public relations firm before they hired Freeze to help them navigate the potential fallout. A lesson to ADs everywhere: If you have to hire a crisis PR firm to help sell your toxic hire, just don't. Auburn hiring Freeze was a win-at-all-costs move that ultimately just delivered shame rather than any win of consequence. Unlike Harsin, the power brokers all coalesced around Freeze. After a failed coup to insert Kevin Steele as head coach after Gus Malzahn was fired in 2020, Freeze was actually the preferred candidate of many of those top Auburn supporters. He was never able to get any traction that first time around with then-university president Jay Gogue, who made clear he wouldn't support a Freeze hire. \nWhen Freeze was hired in November 2022, Auburn put a robust NIL operation behind him to go get the players he needed to get Auburn back to where it belonged. Freeze recruited the high school ranks well, signing back-to-back top 10 classes in 2024 and 2025, but in terms of overall roster management, he never really got it. Freeze admitted to his staff early on that he didn't have to deal with NIL much at Liberty and didn't really know how it worked. Despite that, according to sources, he still surrounded himself with Liberty staff who hadn't managed NIL or the transfer portal. \"From Day 1 of when they got there, I knew it'd be a shitshow,\" said a former Auburn staffer. \nWith the portal, Freeze could be slow to act and miss out on players he needed, including offensive linemen, to more aggressive programs. He'd complain about having to get on the phone with high-profile transfer portal players, according to sources, and try to pass it off to other staffers. Freeze struggled with the fast-paced nature of transfer recruiting -- how much his program is willing to pay and what the vision for the upcoming season will be -- and how different it was from his usual approach with high school recruits. Never was that more frustrating than how Freeze approached the quarterback position. ****For the many reasons Freeze lost his job, his inability to fix an increasingly predictable offense or pick the right quarterback rank at the top. \nNo one got more mileage off two wins to earn an offensive guru title than Freeze. He seemed perpetually stuck in his brief glory years back in Oxford when he beat Alabama in 2014 and 2015 before it all came crashing down. He was resistant to outside advice, especially when it came to trying to improve a stale offense that somehow got worse by the day. \"It's arrogance. It's never his fault,\" said a former Auburn staffer. \"It's always the guys on the field.\"Freeze never got the quarterback position right in his three years at Auburn. Grabbing Michigan State quarterback Payton Thorne in 2023 made some sense on paper, even if beneath the surface there were concerns. Thorne had a big 2021 season for the Spartans, where he threw for 3,232 yards and 27 touchdowns, but was coming off a much more modest 19 touchdowns and 11 interception season when the Tigers signed him. The underlying issue was Thorne no longer had running back Kenneth Walker or receiver Jalen Nailor to help him. \nEven if there were those in the building who were against taking Thorne in the first place -- and there were, according to multiple sources -- the bigger issue was that Freeze doubled down on Thorne for a second season. Despite the Tigers going 6-6 in Year 1 behind Thorne, who threw for 1,755 yards, 16 touchdowns and 10 interceptions, Freeze thought the best strategy was to surround him with more talent the way Michigan State had in 2021. Auburn went out and got highly-regarded Penn State transfer receiver Keandre Lambert-Smith and a recruiting class that included five-star Cam Coleman. Freeze opted to stick with Thorne despite multiple coaches and personnel staffers in the building pushing him to consider Washington State transfer Cam Ward. There was an internal push to go after Ward from the jump, but Freeze and quarterbacks coach Kent Austin were resistant. They didn't want to upset what they believed was a young, talented QB room that included four-star freshman Walker White and redshirt freshman Hank Brown. They did check in very late in the process with Ward, who ultimately landed at Miami, to see if he'd still consider Auburn but never went all-in to get him. They preferred to stick with what they had. \"They legitimately thought Thorne was the answer,\" said an Auburn source \"and they were wrong.\"\nFreeze was warned my multiple people in the building that keeping Thorne was the wrong move.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Ward was terrific at Miami and finished as a Heisman Trophy finalist. White and Brown both transferred after the 2024 season to Baylor and Iowa, respectively. In recent months, Senator Tommy Tuberville, a former Auburn head coach, has told a story to Auburn supporters that he had tried to convince Freeze to go after New Mexico State transfer Diego Pavia instead of keeping Thorne. Freeze was plenty familiar with Pavia, who led NMSU to a shocking upset win over Auburn in that 2023 season and has been a revelation since transferring to Vanderbilt. But Freeze told the senior Alabama senator he preferred to keep Thorne and build around him in the transfer portal. \"You're a dead man if you don't have a quarterback,\" Tuberville said he told Freeze. And all it took was a few games for Freeze to realize he'd made a mistake. On the Friday before a home game against Oklahoma last season, which turned out to be another loss, Freeze admitted to a source he blew it with Thorne and should have taken a transfer quarterback instead. Auburn limped to the end of a 5-7 season knowing it had to get the quarterback position right. \nIt's one reason there was so much industry surprise when Auburn went all-in on Oklahoma transfer Jackson Arnold. The pedigree was there as a former five-star, but it had been an up-and-down first season in Norman for Arnold which included a benching. In fact, the Oklahoma team Freeze lost to was led by Michael Hawkins, who replaced Arnold as the Sooners' starter for a month. Arnold was anything but a surefire pick in a critical year Freeze needed to win big. Perhaps all it took was watching Arnold run all over Alabama in a late season win for Freeze to dream of what he could do for him in the Iron Bowl. \"He went wrong with the quarterback,\" said a Power Four personnel source who has studied Auburn. \"He f—-- that up. They've got a really good defense. You can't argue with their wide receiver group. Obviously they're not doing anything, but they're not doing anything because they had nobody to get them the football.\"It's not solely Arnold's fault -- a mediocre offensive line and uninspiring play-calling haven't done him any favors -- but when you surveyed the roster it again looked like the quarterback Freeze hand-picked over more reliable options was yet again holding Auburn back. In five SEC losses this season, Auburn lost by an average margin of 7.2 points. In those same five losses, Auburn averaged 11.4 points and 178.4 passing yards per game. The Tigers were a dreadful 20 for 74 on third-down conversions. This despite a talented group of receivers that includes Coleman and Georgia Tech transfer Eric Singleton, who are both believed to be earning seven figures annually. Freeze benched Arnold in favor of Ashton Daniels in Auburn's lone SEC win over Arkansas last week. Both played in a 10-3 loss to Kentucky that was the final straw for Auburn AD John Cohen. In a bizarre season that has included Cohen comparing Freeze to a car that may or may not start, there was no coming back from a loss to the Wildcats that elicited loud chants calling for the head coach's dismissal. DJ Durkin's defense did what it needed to keep Auburn in the game, but the offense was again listless and helpless. Auburn was too talented -- and too much money had been invested in the roster -- to accept any more failure. Freeze had been given Michelin star-caliber ingredients, but he was still serving up elementary school cafeteria meals. There was no need to prolong the inevitable any longer. ****The days of Freeze being relevant within major college football are all but over. He's all baggage and no upside at this point in his career. If you're going to sell your soul for football success as Auburn attempted, you want national championships -- not a guy who was somehow worse than Bryan Harsin. There won't be another comeback story after this. \n        \n            \n                What's next for Hugh Freeze after Auburn firing? Don't expect him to lead a Power Four program anytime soon\n                \n                    Chris Hummer                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nFreeze leaves Auburn as one of the worst hires in school history. Given all the resources at his disposal, a 15-19 (6-16 in the SEC) record is an abject failure. He was never able to come close to replicating the Ole Miss magic that made schools want to keep giving him more chances. He still believed he was an offensive wizard until the very end even if the results were abysmal. At the time of Freeze's firing, Auburn ranked 121st in rushing offense, 104th in passing offense and 110th in scoring offense. All three of those rank in the bottom three of the SEC. For a man who used to reach out to reporters and fans and offer to pray for them over stories and tweets he didn't like, he may want to stay off the internet for a few days. The downfall of Freeze, who until the very end insisted Auburn was close to turning it around, has prompted schadenfreude across college football. Even in the face of professional disappointment, there are silver linings. It will be in the 70s and sunny this week in Auburn -- the perfect weather for a golf round or two. \n    \n                                        \n    The Auburn Tigers are searching for their next head football coach following the dismissal of Hugh Freeze.

    "body": "\n        Enhanced email blasts and social media spreaders have started at Ohio State for this college football season's Heisman Trophy race. The top-ranked and unbeaten Buckeyes are campaigning for two potential finalists in the conversation -- quarterback Julian Sayin and wide receiver Jeremiah Smith -- and are trying to become the eighth team since 2000 to send multiple players to New York for the ceremony.Troy Smith became Ohio State's sixth Heisman winner in 2006 and is the last Buckeyes player to earn the prestigious honor despite producing a couple of finalists and national championships since.According to FanDuel Sportsbook's updated odds entering Week 11, Sayin, a redshirt freshman, is the frontrunner with his teammate a few players behind him.Locked in a legitimate competition with redshirt sophomore Lincoln Kienholz during spring camp and the early portion of fall practice, Sayin was Day's pick to lead based on a year-long evaluation that went well beyond arm strength and accuracy.\nSayin needed to be a dependable facilitator given Ohio State's weaponry, like Smith, and be able to move around the pocket given the Buckeyes' changes along the offensive line. His numbers have impressed through eight starts -- 2,188 yards passing and 23 touchdowns -- and Sayin's become even more lethal as the season has progressed.Teams with multiple Heisman finalists since the turn of the century include 2020 Alabama with DeVonta Smith and Mac Jones, the 2019 Buckeyes with Chase Young and Justin Fields, 2016 Oklahoma with Baker Mayfield and Dede Westbrook, 2004 and 2005 USC with Matt Leinart and Reggie Bush, 2004 Oklahoma with Jason White and Adrian Peterson and 2002 Miami with Ken Dorsey and Willis McGahee.PlayerOddsStatisticsJulian Sayin, Ohio State+175176-of-218, 2,188 yards, 23 TD, 3 INTFernando Mendoza, Indiana+220162-of-224, 2,125 yards, 25 TD, 4 INTTy Simpson, Alabama+340177-of-261, 2,184 yards, 20 TD, INTMarcel Reed, Texas A&M+6501,972 yards, 17 TD, 6 INT; 349 rushing, 6 TDGunner Stockton, Georgia+2500161-of-229, 1,176 yards, 12 TD, 2 INTJeremiah Smith, Ohio State+400055 catches, 729 yards, 9 TDDiego Pavia, Vanderbilt+40002,063 yards, 18 TD, 5 INT; 501 rushing, 6 TDTrinidad Chambliss, Ole Miss+40002,023 yards, 10 TD, 2 INT; 435 rushing, 6 TDJeremiyah Love, Notre Dame+4000141 carries, 894 yards, 11 TDThe case for SayinThis is what quarterbacks in Day's system do -- spread the football with heightened accuracy while finding themselves at the top of the Heisman picture thanks to maximum individual and team success. Sayin leads the FBS in passer rating (197.1), completion rate (80.7%) and ranks third in yards per attempt (10.0). The last Heisman winner at quarterback, former LSU star Jayden Daniels, led college football in passer rating (208.0) and yards per attempt (11.7).If Sayin's current completion percentage holds, he would eclipse former Oregon signal caller Bo Nix's single-season record after he was true on 77.5% of his throws in 2023 for the Ducks. Nix finished third that season in Heisman voting behind Daniels and Washington's Michael Penix Jr.Sayin's current eight-game pace exceeds Joe Burrow's mark of 78.8% in 2019 when he led LSU to a national championship and won the Heisman in a historic landslide.Sayin has 14 touchdowns and zero interceptions against Power Four competition this season and hasn't turned it over through the air since a couple of errant throws in his third career start against Ohio in Week 3. Consecutive four-touchdown outings against Penn Sate and Wisconsin -- two winless teams in Big Ten play -- have summoned momentum in the race.Looking closer, most of Sayin's 27 incompletions in Big Ten play are explainable. Five were throwaways, three were tipped near the line of scrimmage and one was dropped by Smith against the Nittany Lions. Only a third of Sayin's misfires in the Big Ten as a first-year starter have been uncatchable, off-target throws.\n        \n            \n                CBS Sports 136: Notre Dame crashes top 10 in college football rankings, resurgent Texas climbs\n                \n                    Chip Patterson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe case for SmithIf the Buckeyes ramp up the targets for Smith over the next four games and make him the featured option in the Big Ten Championship Game, the nation's most-talented wideout would likely best the numbers he posted last season as a freshman.Smith finished with 76 catches for 1,315 yards and 15 scores in 2024, but much of that total came after the Heisman ceremony and over four playoff games. Smith hauled in 19 receptions for 381 yards and three touchdowns in the postseason.If Smith merely hits his season averages -- 6.9 catches, 90.6 yards per game every week — over his final four starts of the regular season along with a title game appearance, that statistical projection would sit at 89 catches for 1,178 yards and 14 touchdowns.Now, those aren't numbers that would win the award, but if he dominates down the stretch and has a monster outing or two, the conversation changes completely.He's Mr. Consistent when it comes to production, regardless of how opposing defenses try and take him out of the game plan. In last week's win over Penn State, Smith beat quarters coverage with a 57-yard reception after beating a cornerback off the line before running past a safety.That's not supposed to happen against that look, neither was his one-handed snare at the goal line on a tipped pass that went for a touchdown.\nThis speaks to his athleticism as the total package at the position and how much confidence Sayin has in the sophomore alongside another extremely productive talent, Carnell Tate.When Alabama's DeVonta Smith won the Heisman in 2020 and became the first wide receiver to take the award in nearly three decades, he did so as the top target of a trifecta of sorts that included John Metchie III and Jaylen Waddle. So it can be done despite a wide dispersal in the passing game.DeVonta Smith's quarterback, Mac Jones, finished third in Heisman voting that season behind Clemson's Trevor Lawrence and like Sayin, led the country in passer rating (203.1) and completion rate (77.4).Smith briefly touched on his Heisman candidacy before the season while maintaining his laser-like focus on defending Ohio State's crown.\"I definitely want to win it,\" Smith said. \"But I'm just all about the team first. I just want to win that big one, that national championship. That's all I really care about. We've gotta repeat and win it again.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        TORONTO -- As baseball would have it, the fate of the Dodgers' season -- and their place in history -- took the form of a ground ball headed for Mookie Betts. Of course it was Betts. Five years ago, the Dodgers started this run after luring him away from Boston and signing him to the second-largest contract ever at the time. After losing back-to-back World Series in 2017 and 2018, Hollywood's team committed to buying a trophy. Betts was the foundational piece. The cornerstone of the Dodgers' championship splurge. They paid for his talent, for his championship pedigree. And the six-time Gold Glove right fielder was so versatile in his capacity that he moved to shortstop this season.The ball found him. Betts stepped on second and fired to Freddie Freeman -- another star who followed Betts to L.A. earlier this decade -- for the final two outs of one of the best World Series games ever. Dodgers 5, Blue Jays 4 in 11 thrilling Game 7 innings. The Dodgers' third title in six tries.  A fitting punctuation for sports' latest dynasty. \"Honestly, nobody knows, because they weren't in my head, but I was so nervous,\" Betts said. \"I've never been in that situation. And I was so nervous, and I literally, as he was pitching the ball, I was talking to myself, saying, 'Be nasty, Mook. Just make a play. Be nasty. Be nasty.'\" \nMoney spent doesn't guarantee titles. But in the intensity of Game 7, with the stakes of the World Series at center table, and the magic of the underdog Blue Jays threatening to doom their dynastic bid, the Dodgers' embarrassment of riches flexed. They leaned on it hard, pressed every ounce of expertise they expensed.Will Smith, the $140 million catcher, hit the go-ahead home run in the 11th. Yoshinobu Yamamoto, baseball's only $325 million pitcher, got the win in relief -- a day after getting the win as a starter. And Betts, the $365 superstar, sealed it by scooping up the grounder, stepping on second and firing a laser to Freeman, the $160 million first baseman.Money well spent. \"We've put together something pretty special, I do know that,\" manager Dave Roberts said. \"I'm proud of the players for the fans, scouting, player development, all the stuff. To do what we've done in this span of time is pretty remarkable. I guess let the pundits and all the fans talk about if it's a dynasty or not, but I'm pretty happy with where we're at.\" \nIt took everything the Dodgers had to outlast the Blue Jays. But even the destiny that seemed to push Toronto ran out of gas. The fervor of Canada, the spirit of Joe Carter, the hunger of Vladimir Guerrero Jr., couldn't match the depths of Dodger excellence. Los Angeles was too talented, too experienced, too layered.Winning a championship is hard. Repeating in baseball is even harder. The last team to pull it off was the 2000 Yankees, carried by stars in their own right. Derek Jeter among them, who watched the Dodgers celebrate firsthand Saturday night.Dynasties don't come in shiny suits. Oftentimes, they appear in battered form, pushed to the limit. Worn. Bloodied. The Dodgers wore that crown. Proudly. They got punched by a Bo Bichette three-run homer that sent the Rogers Centre into a frenzy. But Los Angeles responded. When Toronto punched again, when Andrés Giménez laced an RBI double to right-center field, it was Max Muncy who counterpunched. He launched a homer off Trey Yesavage in the eighth to pull the club within one.\nThen in the ninth inning, the tides turned. For all the money spent on the big names, like Shohei Ohtani and Blake Snell, just as important to a dynasty are players like Miguel Rojas, a veteran glue who helps keep his team grounded. That's the genius of the Dodgers empire. Yeah, they have deep pockets. And they use them to acquire everything necessary to win. The superstars and the superglues.Down to their last two outs, Rojas took a Jeff Hoffman hanging slider, hooking it for a game-tying solo shot in the top of the ninth. \nThen in the bottom half, the defensive play of the night -- even better than Betts' game-ending double play -- was the game-saving catch by Pages. In a gesture of the Dodgers' never-ending options, he came in for defense. When a sac fly would win it for Toronto, manager Dave Roberts needed a strong arm for a potential throw to the plate. Pages entered the game with one out. One batter later, Pages displayed his glove, tracking down a deep fly ball and running over his teammate Kiké Hernandez to snare it. Crisis averted.\n\"They get the three-run bomb early and the roof exploded off this place,\" Muncy said. \"Loudest place I think I've ever been. As a hitting group, we kind of met and talked about what we talked about in Philly -- there's going to be a moment where it gets extremely loud. But it's going to be extremely silent when we're on top at the end.\" \n        \n            \n                Ranking seven craziest moments from Dodgers' unforgettable World Series Game 7 win vs. Blue Jays\n                \n                    Matt Snyder                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAnd it was. Yamamoto was the hero, worthy of a World Series MVP, tossing 2 ⅔ scoreless frames to close it. This was one night after a six-inning outing in Game 6 where he threw 96 pitches. This is how dynasties are molded. Through shared experience. Through resolve. Through the pain showing up as product, not just promise. Enduring even when the road isn't the swiftest.\n\"In baseball, three titles in six years is a dynasty,\" Dodgers minority owner Magic Johnson said. \"It's not like we've been doing it for a long time, but in a short period of time to have three World Series. And to win back-to-back, because it's so hard in baseball to do that, that's why I'm saying it. It's so difficult in baseball to achieve what we just achieved.\" Achievement spilled into the batting cage, where champagne and beer became the spokesmen for success. Ohtani and Yamamoto were the first to emerge in the clubhouse, washing away what had felt so heavy for so long. The $1.025 billion the Dodgers spent on them comes with responsibility. They both fulfilled them during this postseason to help push their team to a Game 7 and into the history books. Freeman, to the right of the pair, noted that the expectations will grow more. No team has three-peated since Jeter's Yankees. That's now the standard. The blueprint they will try to measure. \nBetts, meanwhile, embraced his family. Sheer joy that was hard for him to find this season. He's the linchpin. The common denominator of what this organization has become. \n            ",

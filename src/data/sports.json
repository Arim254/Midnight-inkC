    "body": "\n        The Miami Dolphins have hired Jon-Eric Sullivan as their next general manager, the team announced on Friday evening. Sullivan is a long-time Green Bay Packers executive who started with the team in 2003 and has worked as the vice president of player personnel since 2022.\"What an incredible honor it is to serve as general manager of the Miami Dolphins, an organization of history, tradition and great pride,\" said Sullivan in a statement. \"I want to express my gratitude to Stephen Ross and his family for this exceptional opportunity and the belief they've placed in me to lead this storied franchise forward. I also want to thank the entire Packers organization, especially Brian Gutekunst and the late Ted Thompson, for their leadership and allowing me to be entrenched in a process that has brought more than 30 years of sustained success to Green Bay.\"Now, as we forge ahead, we will build a football team that is resilient, physical and tough. We will compete no matter the circumstances, with the ultimate goal of competing for division championships and Super Bowls. Our team building process will be intentional, disciplined and sound. And we will do it together, with collaboration and hard work. It has always been and always will be a team sport. I can't wait to get started.\"\nSullivan was a scout with the Packers when they won Super Bowl XLV to cap off the 2010 season and has worked closely with Packers GM Brian Gutekunst to build a perennial playoff contender in Green Bay. Sullivan is the son of long-time college and NFL coach Jerry Sullivan, who spent 40 years on various sidelines and worked for the Dolphins as a wide receivers coach in 2004.In Miami, Sullivan replaces Chris Grier, who was fired by the Dolphins in October after serving as the team's GM since 2016, when he was promoted from director of college scouting. During Grier's tenure as general manager, the Dolphins experienced seven losing seasons and reached the postseason only three times. Miami has not won a playoff game since 2000.\n        \n            \n                Dolphins fire Mike McDaniel: Offensive guru out after second straight losing season, benching Tua Tagovailoa\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSullivan's first task in Miami will be hiring a new coach to replace Mike McDaniel, who was fired Thursday after the team's 7-10 finish to the 2025 season, his fourth as coach. The Dolphins started the year 2-7 but rallied by winning five of their final eight. Ultimately, it was not enough to save McDaniel's job as owner Stephen Ross said the team is in need of \"comprehensive change.\"\n\"I could not be more excited to welcome Jon-Eric Sullivan as our next general manager. Jon-Eric brings a clear vision for how to build and run a football team, founded upon his own experience at a winning organization,\" Dolphins wner Stephen Ross said in a statement. \"As we went through our search process, it became undeniable the respect Jon-Eric has across the league as a talent evaluator, leader and man of integrity.\"Miami's season included the benching of former No. 5 overall pick Tua Tagovailoa one year after the Dolphins signed him to a four-year, $212.4 million contract extension. Tagovailoa said Monday he would \"be good with\" a new opportunity elsewhere. After hiring a new coach, figuring out what to with Tagovailoa, who has a $56.4 million cap hit in 2026, will surely be one of Sullivan's top priorities. \n            ",

Brady Kannon, who is 26-9-2 (+1590) over his last 37 NFL ATS picks, is backing the Chargers (+3.5) to cover versus New England on Sunday night.\"Patriots' schedule has been a sore spot for their supporters all season but there is no denying, they played hardly any good teams. They were 2-2 vs playoff teams, splitting with the Bills and also splitting with the Panthers and Steelers, the two worst teams in the tournament. Chargers were 3-2 vs playoff teams (not counting Week 18) and had to face Denver, Philly, Steelers, Jaguars, and Texans. LAC also has the better point differential vs common opponents. They have an excellent formula for playoff football: a rushing attack, a pass rush, and an excellent defense. When I crunch my numbers, I come up with LAC as a 1-point favorite. I'll gladly take anything greater than a field goal and they just might win outright.\" Kannon's Wild Card NFL picks can be found here.Bet the Chargers to cover at DraftKings:\nSteelers vs. Texans Monday night picks Something has to give on NFL Wild Card Monday as the Steelers have lost six straight postseason games, while the Texans are 0-6, all-time, in road playoff games. Both of these squads enter their Monday night meeting with nine against-the-spread wins this season as they will meet in a playoff game for the first time ever. R.J. White, who is 37-20-1 (+1455) over his last 58 ATS picks in Steelers games, is backing Pittsburgh (+3) to cover.\"The Steelers are in the playoffs by the skin of their teeth, and the market is treating them as DOA. But I'm not underrating a team that scored 25+ points in nine of its last 12 games, even managing it in the finale without DK Metcalf. He's back, as is T.J. Watt, and when you throw in Mike Tomlin as one of the best coaches in football, the current version of Pittsburgh rates above average for me. The Texans' elite defense gave up 30 points to Riley Leonard and the offense has been inconsistent, getting shut down in Week 16 by the Raiders of all teams. Pittsburgh is live for the win here at home against an indoors team playing in a tough road environment.\" See more Texans vs. Steelers picks here.Pick Pittsburgh to cover at DraftKings:\n            ",

These teams have the same 9-8 spread record, but Pittsburgh is 4-1 ATS over its last five, while Houston has failed to cover in two of its last three. While Houston has an elite defense, it allowed its most points (30) all year in Week 18 to a Colts team with a fourth-string rookie quarterback, which is no comparison to an Aaron Rodgers-led unit getting back a rested DK Metcalf. As for C.J. Stroud, he is 0-2 on the road in his playoffs career, failing to account for a touchdown in either loss. The Steelers are forecasted to cover over 50% of the time, with the Over hitting in well over 50% of simulations. See which other teams to pick here, and bet the Steelers using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nHow to make Wild Card NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Wild Card Weekend NFL schedule and just revealed three teams projected to outright win over 60% of the time, potentially giving you a huge payday.

Davis underwent testing that reportedly revealed ligament damage. Davis and the Mavericks will consult a second opinion to determine the best course of action. If surgery is required the oft-injured big man could miss extended time. Davis has appeared in 20 games this season for the Mavericks, averaging 20.4 points and 11.1 rebounds per game, but injuries have kept him from consistently being on the floor -- as has been the case for much of his career. Davis missed 15 games early this season with a calf injury, then suffered a groin injury in Dallas' Christmas Day game that cost him two more games. \n\n        \n            \n                The Hawks have a good thing going... as long as they don't screw it up by trading for Anthony Davis\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe injury impacts not only the Mavericks, but some other teams that were considering Davis as a target ahead of the Feb. 5 trade deadline. The Atlanta Hawks were reportedly one of the top potential suitors for Davis, having cleared some space after trading Trae Young to the Washington Wizards. However, this latest injury for Davis would drastically impact his trade market if he is sidelined for a significant period of time\nDallas, Atlanta and other potential suitors will await word on whether Davis will require surgery and what kind of timeline for a return to the court he's facing. In the meantime, the 14-24 Mavericks will prepare for another stretch of the season without their star center. \n            \n    ",

Kepler played the entire 2025 season with the Philadelphia Phillies.Under MLB's Joint Drug Agreement, PED suspensions cover regular season and postseason games \"in which the Player would have been eligible to play.\" Kepler can serve the suspension while a free agent, should he remain unsigned. If he does sign, he will not be paid during the suspension. Kepler will not be eligible to play in the 2026 postseason.Kepler, 33 next month, authored a .216/.300/.391 batting line with 18 home runs in 2025. That includes .216/.305/.399 line against righties. By OPS+, Kepler has been a below-average hitter four times in the last four years. Corner outfield defense is only so valuable. Kepler was likely to settle for a small one-year control prior to the suspension.In parts of 11 MLB seasons, the first 10 of which were spent with the Minnesota Twins, Kepler owns a .235/.316/.425 line with 179 home runs and 20.6 WAR. His best year was 2019, when he slugged 36 home runs. (Lots of homer records were set that year.)\nWe did not rank Kepler among the offseason's top 50 free agents.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        UFC paints on a fresh canvas in 2026. A seven-year deal between UFC and Paramount+ begins later this month, removing the pay-per-view model and reimagining matchmaking elements.There are differences between dream fights, fights the UFC can make, and the ones they'll book. A Ronda Rousey comeback would be front-page news, but it's unlikely to happen. Alex Pereira vs. Khamzat Chimaev is gangbusters, but the timing doesn't line up well for 2026 -- Chimaev hasn't defended the middleweight title yet, and Pereira wants to move up and challenge at heavyweight. Even Jon Jones' return is unlikely based on UFC CEO Dana White's statements. Fortunately, grounding expectations still leaves us with numerous blockbuster fights. With 2026 underway, let's explore the five biggest fights to make this year, rooted in reality.Get ready for the start of the Paramount+ era with our UFC Fan Guides: Brief history of the sport | Active fighters to know | Most exciting fights to watch ahead of UFC 324 | Important rules to know\nWelterweight title: Islam Makhachev vs. Ilia Topuria Can you name a bigger super fight you can make right now? I don't think it's possible. Makhachev and Topuria are the very best the promotion has to offer: reigning UFC champions, two-division champs and the active top two pound-for-pound fighters. Topuria and Makhachev are among the sport's most popular fighters and have an existing rivalry to build on. Very rarely do the stars align so strongly. The UFC has hurdles to overcome before booking this fight. Topuria will miss the first quarter of 2025, at minimum, while battling an alleged extortion plot. The UFC needs championship main events, meaning Makhachev will likely defend his title before then. The four welterweight contenders that come to mind are Kamaru Usman, Ian Machado Garry, Shavkat Rakhmonov and Michael Morales. Whatever direction the UFC goes, a successful title defense gives Makhachev enough time to fight Topuria in the back half of 2026. Topuria's timeline might be even tighter with a rightful challenger awaiting him.\nLightweight title: Ilia Topuria vs. Paddy PimblettUFC 324 will be headlined by an interim lightweight title fight in Topuria's absence. The winner, either Justin Gaethje or Pimblett, should be in line for a title unifier. With complete respect to Gaethje, arguably the most exciting fighter in UFC history, Topuria vs. Pimblett is the bigger box office fight. Topuria and Pimblett's heated rivalry dates back years. In 2022, Topuria and Pimblett had a heated altercation in a London hotel. \nPimblett was a lightweight prospect whose commercial appeal far outweighed his critical success. Topuria was an unheralded featherweight. A fight between them made little sense. Topuria eclipsed Pimblett in a few short years, becoming a two-division champion and graduating to Pimblett's weight class. \"The Baddy\" took more time to mature into an elite fighter, but is now on the cusp of holding an interim title. UFC 324 has shades of Conor McGregor vs. Chad Mendes -- the loudmouth European fighting the heavy-handed American, with a shot at a decorated international champion in the balance. Pimblett parading around with the interim title while mocking Topuria makes for excellent television. A press conference tour would kick it into overdrive. Pimblett needs to overcome Gaethje for any of this to come to fruition, but it'll be a big deal if it does.Women's bantamweight title: Amanda Nunes or Kayla Harrison vs. Valentina Shevchenko  Nunes and Harrison are keeping the women's bantamweight division afloat. Raquel Pennington and Julianna Pena failed to generate interest as UFC champions. In hindsight, they were detours between Nunes' retirement and Harrison's reign. The division gets back on track at UFC 324. \nHarrison vs. Nunes serves as the co-main event. It immediately stands among the most pivotal women's fights of all time. Nunes is the greatest women's MMA fighter ever: a former two-division champion who beat Rousey, Cris Cyborg, Valentina Shevchenko (twice) and many more. Harrison is among the most decorated women's combat athletes: a two-time gold medalist judoka, two-time PFL tournament winner, and reigning UFC champion. The promotion should get creative if they want to keep the momentum rolling coming out of UFC 324.UFC women's flyweight champion Shevchenko is coming off arguably her career-defining win, preventing former UFC women's champ Zhang Weili from joining the exclusive champ-champ club. \"Bullet\" doesn't have much left to prove at 125 pounds. She's the division's best fighter by a mile and long ago solidified her spot on the women's MMA Mount Rushmore. Natalia Silva and Erin Blanchfield are suitable contenders, but they can wait. Shevchenko has expressed interest in fighting Harrison, an idea floated by the women's bantamweight champ. She also wants to avenge her two losses to Nunes. Their second fight, a split decision, is heavily disputed as fans continue debating who should have left Canada as women's bantamweight champion.\nConor McGregor vs. Anyone A decade ago, the UFC sold for more than $4 billion. McGregor was pivotal to the sport's popularity boom at the time. He and Rousey were the biggest stars MMA has ever seen. Now, his reputation couldn't be much lower. Consecutive losses to Dustin Poirier hurt his competitive standing, and pulling out of his 2024 return against Michael Chandler with a broken pinky toe killed his goodwill with fans. He was also suspended for 18 months for a UFC anti-doping violation.Despite all of that, McGregor probably outdraws every current fighter on the UFC roster. His name, for better or worse, transcends MMA. It doesn't matter who he fights at this point. Chandler is still the most suitable opponent, especially in his current state. He also deserves it after McGregor stalled his career. UFC could also re-sign Nate Diaz for a long-overdue trilogy that should tap into a big market.McGregor has feverishly campaigned to fight at the White House card. He'll be eligible to compete by then. Unlike Jones, UFC CEO Dana White has expressed interest in bringing McGregor back for the event.\nBantamweight title: Petr Yan vs. Sean O'MalleyA new champion brings new possibilities. Dvalishvili nearly cleaned out the bantamweight division before Yan spoiled his plans to be the first UFC champion to make four title defenses in one year. CBS Sports' 2025 Fighter of the Year has numerous exciting options in his future. A trilogy fight with Dvalishvili and a first-time encounter with Umar Nurmagomedov sound terrific, but something about the Sean O'Malley rematch stands out. The two men previously fought in 2022. It was considered a mismatch at the time. Yan was the former champion and top contender against the rising star O'Malley who seemed to have more bark than bite.The fight overdelivered. It was a competitive three-round battle that earned Fight of the Night honors. O'Malley gave a great account of himself, though most believe Yan edged him out -- 96% of media scores gathered by MMA Decisions saw it for Yan. The judges disagreed. O'Malley was awarded a controversial split decision that expedited his trajectory to becoming UFC champion. Yan demolished Dvalishvili in their rematch, so why not continue the revenge tour against O'Malley? O'Malley fights Song Yadong on the UFC 324 main card; meanwhile, Nurmagomedov fights Deiveson Figueiredo on the undercard. A victory puts either man in a prime position to challenge Yan, but O'Malley's elevated position on the card suggests the promotion sees him as the more valuable player.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Fight sports are a funny thing. The goal is simple: hurt your opponent. It's something that everyone understands. But the sportification of mixed martial arts introduces rules and concepts that sometimes confuse UFC viewers.There is no need to explain why Conor McGregor became the featherweight champion after knocking out Jose Aldo at UFC 194, or who the victor was when McGregor tapped to Khabib Nurmagomedov at UFC 229. But, whether Alexander Volkanovski truly beat Max Holloway in their second meeting? That one will be endlessly debated. UFC is more accessible than ever before under the new Paramount+ partnership. Before the new era takes off, beginning with UFC 324 on Jan. 24, let's take a deep dive or refresher course on how UFC fights are won, what moves are illegal, how rounds are scored, and what it takes to become a UFC champion. More UFC Fan Guide: Brief history of the sport | Active fighters to know | Most exciting fights to watch ahead of UFC 324\nHow fights are wonMethods of victory fall under one of four categories: knockouts, submissions, decisions and disqualifications. Let's break down each of them. Knockout: The most common striking finishes are a KO or technical knockout (TKO). A KO ruling is made when a fighter cannot intelligently defend themselves. A TKO is different because a fighter is not intelligently defending themselves. A referee will often intervene with a TKO stoppage when a conscious fighter is visibly hurt and doing little more than covering up under a barrage of strikes. TKOs are also awarded if there's a doctor stoppage, a corner stoppage (e.g., throwing in the towel), or a fighter fails to answer the bell to begin a round. Doctor stoppages are usually rendered because of severe lacerations or injuries that compromise a fighter's ability to compete safely.Submission: There are three subcategories for submission rulings. The most common is a physical tap out, where an opponent uses their body, most often in the form of short, rapid taps with their hand, to indicate surrender. Verbal tapouts are more nuanced. A fighter can verbally announce their surrender, but a voluntary or involuntary screen of pain or distress also counts. Lastly, there are technical submissions, where a submission move renders the opponent unconscious or breaks/dislocates their bones or joints.\nDecision: Each fight is scored by three judges at Octagon side. Four different decision outcomes can result in a winner. A unanimous decision is read when all three judges score the fight in favor of one fighter. A split decision occurs when two judges score the fight for one combatant, and the other judge scores it for the opponent. A majority decision is similar, with two judges scoring the fight for one contestant, but the dissenting judge scoring a draw. Technical decisions are very rare. If a fight is stopped prematurely because of an injury from an accidental foul, and the majority of the rounds have been completed (two rounds in a three-round fight, or three rounds in a five-round fight), a winner will be determined based on the scorecards at that point. This happened last February when Henry Cejudo, the recipient of unintentional eye pokes, was unable to continue after Round 3 of his main event fight. There are also two conditions for fights that result in no winner: a no-contest or a draw. A no-contest occurs when a fight is stopped prematurely due to an accidental foul, and the conditions for a technical decision have not been reached. There are various types of draws, but they all amount to the same core principle: no fighter has an edge on more than one judge's scorecard.\nDisqualifications: The intentionality of fouls is a hot-button topic in MMA. Referees are hesitant to penalize fighters, often resulting in situations where even repeat fouls are deemed unintentional. DQs are rarely exercised for this reason. A fighter can be disqualified if they injure their opponent with a severe intentional foul -- this is the most common utilization of the rule. DQs can also occur if a fighter commits multiple fouls or flagrantly disregards the rules or referee's commands, but good luck seeing that happen.What's illegal in MMA?MMA is a legitimate and widely accepted sport. Use this guide as trivia the next time your grandmother asks you why you're watching that barbaric, \"no-holds-barred\" cagefighting at Christmas dinner. There are many different types of fouls in MMA, far too many to list here. Some of the most significant ones are head-butting, eye-gouging, groin attacks, and biting. Determining whether fouls are intentional or not, and how referees reprimand fighters, is a sticking point for the previously mentioned debate. It doesn't have to be a DQ or nothing situation. Referees can penalize fighters by deducting points for severe or repeated fouls. It's rarely done, but there seems to be an uptick in referee intervention after recent, high-profile eye poke situations, like Tom Aspinall at UFC 320, where he was unable to continue from an apparent accidental foul. Even extending fingers forward to an opponent's face or eyes is already considered a foul. \nNumerous location-specific strikes are also illegal. Strikes to the spine, throat, and the back of the head are off limits. Kicking or kneeing a grounded fighter is also illegal. A fighter is considered grounded if any part of their body, other than their hands or feet, is on the mat. The rule was updated in 2024 to stop fighters from intentionally placing one hand on the mat -- at the time, a qualifier for being \"grounded\" -- thus gaming the system. The Association of Boxing Commissions also legalized 12-6 elbows, a move that famously resulted in the only loss, a DQ ruling, of Jon Jones' career.While most state athletic commissions followed suit with the ABC's updates, they are not explicitly required to. A small handful of commissions have held onto older versions of the rule, creating a perplexing situation for fighters and viewers.How rounds are scored (and why it's confusing)Scoring criteria is probably the most confusing and divisive subject among fans, fighters and analysts. In 2022, CBS Sports published a long-form feature with multiple experts breaking down the issues with it.\nUFC fights are contested across three five-minute rounds. The exceptions come in championship fights, main events and some special attractions that are held for a maximum of five five-minute rounds. Each round is scored independently. Whatever success you have in Round 1 bears no numeric influence on how judges score subsequent rounds. Three judges sit Octagonside, working separately from one another. Should the fight reach the final buzzer, their scorecards are tabulated, round-by-round, to determine a winner. Most often, whoever wins the majority of the rounds wins the fight, but that's where things get confusing. Each judge awards 10 points to the fighter they believe won the round, with their opponent earning nine or fewer. In close rounds, this means judges might submit contradictory scores. A round too close to call, and one with a clear winner, can both be scored 10-9. This is because judges are disincentivized from scoring 10-10 rounds, and the margin between a nine and an eight is wide. A fighter can win a round 10-8 if they are dominant and create a large gap between winning and losing the round. This is where MMA and boxing differ as a boxer can win a round 10-8 by scoring a knockdown.So, how are rounds actually scored? This is where things get messy. The Unified MMA Rules, the system UFC adopts for most of its fights, has a hierarchical criteria system: effective striking/grappling, effective aggressiveness and control of the fighting area, in that order. Think of it as having a Plan A, B, and C. If the judges can determine which fighter fulfilled the condition for Plan A more effectively, Plan B or C isn't considered. \n\"Effective\" is another important word in the language. Holding onto your opponent for dear life, or clamping down on a position, shouldn't net you much favor with the judges. \"Effective\" fighting involves progressing to a finish. Think hard strikes, legitimate submission attempts, or advancing to more advantageous positions on the ground. The judges are told to reward these actions. You can begin to see the nuance and elements of subjectivity that creep into objective scoring. Take a closer look at effective striking, for example. Effective striking is defined as \"impact/effect of legal strikes\" with the immediate outweighing the cumulative. A knockdown punch or strike that wobbles an opponent is more valuable than a handful of jabs. But what if someone lands one lucky punch in a round where they were severely outstruck? This is where nuance creeps in. Naturally, the damage accrued by striking will often be seen as more valuable than submission attempts, unless the opponent escaped by the narrowest window. If your head hurts, that's OK, but try to keep these principles in mind. Rounds are scored independently; most rounds will be scored 10-9, and the round winner is the person who most effectively progressed the fight towards a finish through impact, dominance, and duration.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Memphis Grizzlies are reportedly seriously listening to trade offers for former All-Star guard Ja Morant for the first time ahead of the Feb. 5 NBA trade deadline. The challenge Memphis faces in trade discussions regarding Morant are similar to what Atlanta dealt with in dealing their own former All-Star guard Trae Young. The Hawks ultimately traded Young to Washington for CJ McCollum and Corey Kispert earlier this week, with neither side sending out any draft compensation in the deal. It was a paltry return for a player of Young's stature, but it was representative of the decrease in how the league values undersized, score-first point guards with defensive deficiencies on large contracts. That poses a problem for the Grizzlies in exploring trade opportunities for Morant. Memphis reportedly is prioritizing young players and/or draft compensation in a deal, but as we saw with the Young trade, there isn't a lot of interest in giving up valuable assets for a player of Morant's archetype right now. \nGiven we have a very recent example of a similar player (albeit with a differing skill set) getting traded, one can't help but wonder who has more trade value between Morant and Young. The Contract DifferenceLet's start with the biggest difference between the two that could work in Memphis' favor. That is the contract situation, where Morant has two more years and $87 million remaining on his deal after the 2025-26 season (with no options). Young, meanwhile, can hit free agency this summer if he chooses or pick up a $49 million player option for the 2026-27 season. Young will be looking to get paid again soon and had the ability to apply a bit of pressure to a team trading for him given his impending option decision. Any time a player will be seeking a new extension, that often works to the detriment of a player's overall trade value. Morant, meanwhile, will be under contract through the 2027-28 season. If a team still believes he can get back to the All-Star level he once showed, that could make him more attractive on the trade market. There are some teams that could view this as a buy low opportunity on an All-Star talent who may just be in need of a fresh start. For teams that don't typically have the opportunity to easily bring in star caliber players, that might be enough to take a swing and hope Morant can find his form again. \nAt 26 years old, Morant still can point to the potential to get his career back on track if he can get back healthy. When he was able to play consistently, the Grizzlies were consistently a competitive team that finished in the top half of the West. That's the pitch for Morant, the hope that if he can tap into the player he was four seasons ago, his Memphis teams always won at a high level. Morant vs. Young: Stats ComparisonUnfortunately, that's about the extent of the positives when it comes to comparing Morant to Young if you're the Grizzlies hoping to extract a better return from another team. Young and Morant are closely comparable statistically over the past four seasons (going back to 2022-23), but Young has played in nearly a full season of games more than the Grizzlies' star in that span. Stats since start of 2022-23 seasonTrae Young: 213 games played, 25.1 ppg, 10.8 apg 42.3/34.7/87.4 shooting splitsJa Morant: 138 games played, 24.1 ppg, 7.7 apg, 45.5/29.5/79.3 shooting splitsIf we were to take it to advanced stats, here's how they compare:Trae Young: 20.1 PER, 17.8 WS, .114 WS/48, 2.0 BPM, 7.6 VORPJa Morant: 20.7 PER, 10.6 WS, .118 WS/48, 3.3 BPM, 5.8 VORPIf you were to take away the 2022-23 season -- Morant's last All-Star campaign -- things tilt considerably toward Young in each of those advanced stat categories. \nMorant's availability has been a concern throughout his career -- he's never played in more than 67 games in a season, and that was as a rookie. Since the start of the 2023-24 season, he's appeared in just 77 games due to a combination of suspensions and injuries. When he has been on the court, Morant's productivity and efficiency have steadily declined. This season, as he's battled more injury issues, he has posted career lows in a number of areas -- much like Young had in Atlanta before being effectively salary dumped to Washington. Morant is averaging 19.0 points and 7.6 assists per game on 40.1/20.8/90.0 shooting splits in his 18 appearances this season. Just as we started to see glimpses of the old Morant, he went back on the injury report with a calf issue. \nAny team considering trading for Morant has to consider the possibility his best basketball is behind him. It's incredibly unfortunate that could be the case, because at his peak, Morant was one of the most entertaining and exciting players in the league. His explosiveness and fearlessness was astonishing to watch, but the latter part of that equation possibly contributed to his decline. Morant has dealt with numerous leg injuries in his career, and it has sapped some of that burst that made him such a terror to defend. Morant once lived at the rim, but his rim frequency has declined in every season of his career. This season, he's dipped to just 22.1% of field goal attempts coming within three feet of the rim -- as a rookie, that number was 39.6%. The 2025-26 season is also the first year of his career that more than 50% of his field goal attempts have come from beyond 10 feet from the basket. For a player whose main offensive weakness is his perimeter shooting, that's a concerning trend. \nSome of that could be attributed to roster changes in Memphis. The context of the team around him has changed, most notably with the departure of Desmond Bane, long the Grizzlies most-feared 3-point shooter. Perhaps another team could believe they could create more space for Morant to attack, but there's no doubt he's taken a step back in terms of his ability to threaten the rim as constantly as he did as a young phenom. Ultimately, it's hard to make a strong argument that Morant is a better player currently than Young, or that he even has more upside for the future. All of that produces a conundrum for Memphis as they begin listening to offers for Morant. It will be exceedingly difficult to get a high-quality young player or a first round pick back for Morant given what we saw with Young's market. \nThe Hawks prioritized getting out of Young's deal without having to give up any draft compensation and not take on any significant long-term money. If the Grizzlies decide to do the same, it's certainly possible they could find a similar deal. As the deadline approaches, we'll find out whether Memphis is truly just testing the waters or if they've reached a point where they want to simply get out of the Morant business. If the latter is true, I'd expect Morant to end up being traded in a similar deal to Young's, where a large veteran contract (or two) comes back to Memphis along with filler. If it's the former, Morant's time as a Grizzly will continue into the summer unless there's one team out there that has more belief in Morant's ability to return to a level we haven't seen in three years than most everyone else. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        In the middle of the fourth quarter on Thursday, Anthony Edwards posted up on the right side of the floor and called for the ball. After catching a high lob from Naz Reid, he pump faked, took one dribble to create space and drained a fadeaway jumper over multiple defenders. The bucket gave Edwards 23 points for the night and 10,000 for his career, making him the third-youngest player in NBA history to reach the milestone. Only LeBron James and Kevin Durant have done so quicker than Edwards, who is 24 years and 156 days old. After finishing with 25 points, seven rebounds and nine assists to help the Minnesota Timberwolves defeat the Cleveland Cavaliers for their fourth win in a row -- the Wolves are now 25-13, they're just 1½ games back of the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference --  Edwards joked that he wished he had been a bit slower to the accomplishment: \"I'm kind of sick that I got it from Kobe. I wish I would have waited like 100 days or something. But it's all good,\"Thanks to Edwards, Bryant is now fourth on the all-time list. PlayerAge when reaching 10K pointsLeBron James23 years, 59 daysKevin Durant24 years, 33 daysAnthony Edwards24 years, 156 daysKobe Bryant24 years, 195 daysThe Timberwolves certainly aren't complaining about the speed with which Edwards has established himself as one of the best scorers in the league. There were plenty of questions about Edwards after the Wolves selected him with the No. 1 pick in the 2020 NBA Draft. He had 40.2/29.4/77.2 shooting splits during his lone collegiate season at Georgia, and gave an infamous quote in an interview with ESPN in which he said he was \"still not really into\" basketball. Six years later, there are no more doubts about Edwards' ability or his love of the game. His rookie campaign is the only time he's been under 20 points per game, and he's increased his scoring average every single season, up to a career-high 29.2 points per game this season. Edwards has also been more efficient than ever. He's above 50% from the field -- up from 44.7% last season -- and 40% from 3 for the first time. In NBA history, only four players have averaged at least 29 points while shooting at least 50% from the field and 40% from 3-point range for a season: Larry Bird, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant and Nikola Jokić. It's still fairly early, but Edwards has a real chance to join that list. After Edwards' historic effort in yet another Wolves win, let's take a closer look at how he's having his best scoring season yet. Changing his shot dietEdwards made major waves last season when he suddenly became a high-volume 3-point shooter. He went from 6.7 3s per game in 2024 to 10.3 per game last season, which checked in at fourth in the league. In terms of total attempts, no one took more than Edwards' 811. He made 39.5% of them, so it was hard to argue with the approach, but it was still jarring to see him pulling up from any and everywhere. While Edwards is still happy to let it fly, he's dialed back the 3-point shooting a bit this season to 8.2 per game. He's taking a few more mid-range attempts these days, but he's primarily replaced the 3s with attempts in the paint. Notably, his average shot distance has dropped from a career-high 16.9 feet last season to 15.3 feet this season. Here's a look at Edwards' percent of field goal attempts by distance over the last two seasons (via Basketball-Reference):Season0-3 ft.3-10 ft.10-16 ft.16 ft. -- 3pt2P3P2024-2517.6%15.8%8.4%8%49.7%50.4%2025-2620.4%16.8%10.8%10.4%58.4%41.6%Catch-and-shoot machineThe 3s Edwards has given up from last season have almost all been pull-up attempts. He's taking about the same amount of catch-and-shoot 3s as he has in the last three seasons. The difference is he rarely misses now. His catch-and-shoot 3-point percentage has jumped a staggering 11.4% from last season to a career-high 53.5%. \nHere are Edwards' catch-and-shoot numbers throughout his career. As you can see, he was consistently in the low 40s percentage wise until his massive jump this season. SeasonC&S 3PAC&S 3P%2020-213.433.5%2021-223.141.3%2022-232.541.7%2023-242.141.1%2024-252.642.1%2025-262.353.5%Of the 182 players in the NBA taking at least two catch-and-shoot 3s per game (min. 25 games played), none have made a higher percentage than Edwards. Phoenix Suns guard Collin Gillespie (51.5%) is the only other player above 50%. What Edwards is doing this season is historic. Shot tracking data on the NBA's stats website goes back to the 2013-14 season. There have only been seven previous instances of a player shooting 50% or better on at least two catch-and-shoot 3s per game (min. 58 games played, or 50 in the shortened 2021 and 2022 seasons). The list is a who's who of the best shooters from the last decade. \nPlayerSeasonC&S 3PAC&S 3P%Kyle Korver2013-144.750%Kyle Korver2014-155.250.6%JJ Redick2015-164.450.2%Buddy Hield2017-182.950.2%Joe Harris2020-215.151.5%Anfernee Simons2020-212.251.4%Luke Kennard2022-233.652.6%Collin Gillespie2025-263.551.5%Anthony Edwards2025-262.353.5%Again, Edwards shot 29.4% from 3-point range in college and 32.9% as a rookie. Now, he's hitting no-dip 3s and is on lists with Kyle Korver and JJ Redick. \nEarlier this season, Edwards became the youngest player to reach 1,200 career 3s. No one in NBA history has reached that milestone before turning 25. Unstoppable at the rimEdwards has always been able to get to the rim with ease, but he's never finished around the basket as well as he is this season. Earlier in his career he would often charge in without much of a plan. There's none of that these days. Edwards is in complete control, and has a vast array of finishes he can go to with either hand. \nAfter taking a career-low 17.6% of his shot attempts from 0-3 feet last season, Edwards has increased that mark to 20.4% this season, per Basketball-Reference. At the same time, he's raised his efficiency in that range by nearly 10% from 67.8% last season to 77.6% this season. The NBA's stats site breaks things down slightly differently, and has Edwards at 71.5% on 4.9 attempts per game in the restricted area per game. Of the 32 guards taking at least four attempts per game in the restricted area, only Amen Thompson (72.6%) is making a higher percentage than Edwards. Finally, we'll look at Synergy Sports, which charts \"at rim\" attempts. There, Edwards is at 68.5% on 6.5 attempts per game, and scoring 1.43 points per possession -- better than Victor Wembanyama, who is at 1.4 points per possession on \"at rim\" attempts. Here's a look at Edwards' \"at rim\" efficiency throughout his career, which shows just how much better he's been this season:SeasonAt rim PPPAt rim rank (Percentile)2020-211.170Average (40%)2021-221.207Average (43%)2022-231.248Average (45%)2023-241.307Good (61%)2024-251.264Average (47%)2025-261.430Excellent (85%)Edwards, who is regarded as one of the best in-game dunkers around, is also throwing down slams at his highest rate since his rookie season, when he had 70 dunks in 72 games (0.97 per game). Through 31 games this season -- he's missed seven due to injury -- he has 28 dunks (0.9 per game). That's well up from last season, when he had a career-low 54 dunks in 79 games (0.68 per game). \nMore free throwsAnother minor factor in Edwards' career season is his increased free throw rate. Trading some 3s for rim attempts hasn't just helped Edwards be more efficient, it's helped him get to the line more often than ever. His .372 free throw rate (number of free throw attempts per field goal attempt) and 7.4 free throw attempts per game are both career bests. Here are Edwards' free throw numbers over the last two seasons:SeasonFT RateFTAFT%2024-25.3086.383.7%2025-26.3727.479.8%Edwards' free throw percentage has dropped slightly this season, so he's only making 0.6 more free throws per game compared to last season, but every little bit helps. \n            ",

    "body": "\nThe 2025 NFL playoffs kick off with a six-game slate as part of NFL Super Wild Card Weekend. The Seattle Seahawks and Denver Broncos secured first-round byes as the top seeds in the NFC and AFC, respectively, and 12 other teams will be fighting to advance to the Divisional Round next week. Many teams were able to rest starters in Week 18 to get healthy for the playoffs, but there are still some notable injuries that bettors should keep in mind for these six wild card games. Here, we break down those injuries as well as the latest NFL betting lines from DraftKings Sportsbook. We will update this post with inactives lists for every team prior to kickoff.Rams at Panthers (4:30 p.m. ET, Saturday)LAR WR Davante Adams (quad, will play)\nDespite missing three games to close out the year, star Rams receiver Davante Adams led the NFL in receiving touchdowns with 14. Los Angeles dropped two of those three games without Adams to fall out of the race for the NFC West and No. 1 seed in the conference. Now, Adams will return for Saturday's matchup with the Panthers, who beat Los Angeles 31-28 in Carolina at the end of November. Los Angeles is a 10.5-point favorite. The total is 45.5.Packers at Bears (8 p.m. ET, Saturday)GB QB Jordan Love (concussion, will play)GB QB Malik Willis (shoulder and hamstring, questionable)GB WR Dontayvion Wicks (concussion, out)CHI WR Rome Odunze (foot, will play)\nThe Packers get Jordan Love back after he was banged up to close out the year, though his backup, Malik Willis, is questionable to suit up behind him. Additionally, receiver Dontayvion Wicks is out for Green Bay after a 332-yard season. As for Chicago, the Bears will get receiver Rome Odunze back after a foot injury cost him considerable time late in the season. Odunze missed the final five games of 2025 after tallying 661 yards and six touchdowns over 12 games. Green Bay is a slight 1.5-point favorite on the road here, and the total is 44.5.Bills at Jaguars (1 p.m. ET, Sunday)BUFF TE Dalton Kincaid (knee, will play)BUFF RB Ty Johnson (ankle, questionable)\nThis matchup sees the No. 1 rushing offense in the Bills face off with the Jaguars' No. 1-ranked run defense. That will be a key matchup to watch, and Buffalo receiving back Ty Johnson is questionable. He had 263 receiving yards and five total touchdowns as the backup to NFL rushing leader James Cook. The good news for the Bills is Josh Allen's favorite target is back, as tight end Dalton Kincaid is off the injury report after missing considerable time with a nagging knee injury.Buffalo is a 1.5-point road favorite. And at 51.5, this total is the highest of the entire six-game Wild Card Weekend slate.49ers at Eagles (4:30 p.m. ET, Sunday)SF WR Ricky Pearsall (knee, questionable)SF OT Trent Williams (hamstring, questionable)PHI OT Lane Johnson (foot, questionable)\nAfter missing nearly half of the season, star Philadelphia right tackle Lane Johnson appears to be on track to return to the lineup on Sunday as he practiced this week and is listed as questionable. The 49ers are also hoping to get their star tackle back as left tackle Trent Williams is questionable after missing Week 18. Second-year receiver Ricky Pearsall is also questionable. He's missed eight games in 2025.The Eagles are -6 on the spread and the total is 44.5.Chargers at Patriots (8 p.m. ET, Sunday)LAC RB Omarion Hampton (ankle, questionable)NE WR Kayshon Boutte (hamstring, questionable)\nThe Chargers have been utterly decimated by injuries on offense this year, particularly at running back and offensive line. Star rookie back Omarion Hampton missed eight games this year but still compiled 737 scrimmage yards and five touchdowns in nine games. He's questionable for this contest with an ankle injury, though he told reporters he expects to play on Sunday. As for the Patriots, explosive receiver Kayshon Boutte is questionable. He cooled off after a three-week stretch with four touchdowns, but Boutte can take the tops off of defenses for Drake Maye. New England is favored by 3.5 points. The total is 45.5.Texans at Steelers (8:15 p.m. ET, Monday)PITT RB Jaylen Warren (illness, TBD)\nThe final injury report for this Monday showdown doesn't come out until Saturday, but one big name who missed practice this week is Steelers starting running back Jaylen Warren. Warren is dealing with an illness, per the report, which is likely a better sign than a different injury. Warren had 958 rushing yards in his first full season as the Steelers' lead running back. Houston is favored by 3-points. The total is 38.5 -- the lowest of the first round.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        No. 1 Indiana will face No. 5 Oregon on Friday night in the Peach Bowl for the right to play Miami for the national championship.If the Hoosiers are able to replicate their performance from earlier in the season when they beat the Ducks on the road in Eugene, it'll be Indiana's first appearance in a national championship game, continuing one of the most remarkable turnarounds in college football history under coach Curt Cignetti. Cignetti's arrival, coupled with his aggressive transfer portal approach, made Indiana an overnight contender, and his greatest transfer success story is quarterback Fernando Mendoza. In his lone season in Bloomington, Mendoza earned the Heisman Trophy and became a projected top-five NFL Draft pick, something few anticipated before the year began.Cignetti was one of those few, and explained to CBS Sports' Jenny Dell what he's seen from Mendoza in terms of development and preparation that's allowed him to reach those heights and made the Hoosiers the title favorites. \n\"I was very excited that we got him. When he went in the portal, it didn't take me long -- in terms of plays,\" Cignetti said. \"When we got him, he was a little behind in the pocket, relative to where I thought he would be in terms of footwork, timing, rhythm and processing. That took a little bit of time. We had a new quarterback coach also, but the development he's made, I can't say enough great things about him. He competes like a lion. He plays his best when the game is on the line. His legs have been invaluable. He can make all the throws, extremely intelligent and I've never seen a guy prepare like him. That's why he's put together the kind of year he's had.\" It's a perfectly Cignetti quote. He can't help but start with all the work Mendoza needed in terms of development when he got there -- and even a bit of disappointment that he wasn't quite as far along as he thought based on tape. However, he then gushes about the strides he's taken in those areas, the various ways he impacts the game and, most importantly to Cignetti, the way he prepares mentally in a way he's never seen from a college player. That last part seems to have endeared Mendoza to Cignetti more than any of the physical attributes or great plays. There are plenty of quarterbacks who can make all the throws and are athletic enough to make plays with their legs, but nothing gets more appreciation from a coach than a quarterback who is fully prepared for each game. \nThat preparation is part of what makes Mendoza and Indiana so good late in games, as he knows what he'll be facing from the opposition and has the confidence to make the plays needed to win. We saw that multiple times this season, including in Eugene against the Ducks, and as he and Indiana get set for the biggest game in program history on Friday night, that preparation is what they hope offers an edge if the game comes down to the fourth quarter once again. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        With an empty-net goal on Thursday night, Patrick Kane became just the sixth American-born NHL player to score 500 goals in his career. It was another major milestone that cements Kane's place as one of the greatest -- if not the greatest -- American ever to play the game.With under four minutes remaining in the Detroit Red Wings' win over the Vancouver Canucks, Kane got the puck at the neutral zone and stared down an empty cage at the other end. He took a few strides inside the blue line and flicked a shot into the net, joining the 500-goal club.\nThat was just the latest in a long list of accomplishments and accolades that Kane has accrued over his career. The three-time Stanley Cup champion also has a Hart Trophy, Conn Smythe Trophy and Calder Trophy on his shelf. That resume stacks up very favorably with other American players throughout history, and it gives Kane a real case to be No. 1.Still, Kane has some stiff competition with players like Mike Modano, Chris Chelios and Brian Leetch among the all-time greats. That's without even considering the modern era of American players like Auston Matthews, Connor Hellebuyck, Matthew Tkachuk and Quinn Hughes.\nNow that Kane has reached the 500-goal mark, here are the top 10 American-born players throughout NHL history.*Brett Hull was not included on this list because, despite playing for Team USA via dual citizenship, he was born in Canada.Below * denotes active player10. Jack Eichel, C*Goals: 252Assists: 401Points: 653The first half of Eichel's career, which he spent with the Buffalo Sabres, was tumultuous. Still, he was a productive player, and it was clear that he could be a true game-changer with a more competent organization. Enter the Vegas Golden Knights. Eichel has established himself as one of the best two-way centers in the game, and he played a pivotal role in the Golden Knights winning their first Stanley Cup in 2023 as he led the league in assists that postseason. Eichel's resume should only get more impressive because it doesn't seem like Vegas is dropping out of contention anytime soon, and he is a big reason for that.\n9. Matthew Tkachuk, RW*Goals: 240Assists: 396Points: 636There is a Tkachuk on this list, but it's not Keith. Instead, his eldest son slots in here after an incredible run over the last four seasons. Even before getting dealt to the Florida Panthers, Tkachuk put up 104 points with the Calgary Flames in 2021-22, and he's completely changed the fortunes of the franchise since arriving in Sunrise. Florida has reached the Stanley Cup Final in each season with Tkachuk on the roster, and they've now won it all in back-to-back years. While playing through some gnarly injuries, Tkachuk has tallied 69 points in 67 playoff games with Florida, including some huge game-winning goals.8. Phil Housley, DGoals: 338Assists: 894Points: 1,232Housley is one of the best offensive defensemen in history, and that's regardless of nationality. His 338 goals are the most by an American defenseman, and they rank fourth-most all-time behind only Ray Bourque, Paul Coffey and Al MacInnis. Housley may not have the Stanley Cups or awards to match some of his American peers, but he is one of the best in a rich and growing history of great defensemen from the United States when he played from 1982-2003.7. Pat LaFontaine, CGoals: 468Assists: 545Points: 1,013While the totals may not be as gaudy as some players left off this list, it should be noted that LaFontaine did all that damage in just 865 games. In terms of points per game, no American player was better than LaFontaine. From 1987-1993, he tallied at least 41 goals and 88 points in each season. In the 1992-93 campaign, LaFontaine put up 148 points, falling just 12 short of the league-leading Mario Lemieux.\n6. Auston Matthews, C*Goals: 422Assists: 339Points: 761At the ripe old age of 28, Matthews is already one of the best scorers in American history. He's easily on pace to become the first American-born 600-goal scorer, and 700 career goals certainly isn't out of the question. He's won the Maurice Rocket Richard Trophy as the NHL's leading scorer three times, and he's one of three Americans to win the Hart Trophy in the expansion era. If he can ever get over the playoff hump, he will vault up this list, possibly to No. 1.5. Connor Hellebuyck, G*Wins: 331GAA: 2.56SV%: .917Shutouts: 45Hellebuyck is already the greatest American goaltender in history, and he still has plenty of saves left in those pads. In 2024-25, Hellebuyck picked up his third Vezina Trophy, and he also earned his first Hart Trophy as the league MVP. Hellebuyck is not only one of the best American goalies, but he will go down as one of the greatest overall by the time he's done. Oh, and if he can backstop Team USA to a gold medal at the 2026 Olympics, his legacy will only grow.4. Brian Leetch, DGoals: 247Assists: 781Points: 1,028I think Leetch has a real case to be at least one spot higher, but there's nothing wrong with sitting in the top four. Much like Kane, Leetch's career has been littered with awards. He started his career with the Calder Trophy in 1989, and he added two Norris Trophy wins in the years after that. To top it all off, he led the New York Rangers to a Stanley Cup in 1994 and won the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoffs MVP.\n3. Mike Modano, CGoals: 561Assists: 813Points: 1,374Modano still holds the record for most goals by an American-born player. While I think that will fall over the next few seasons, that doesn't change the fact that Modano was one of the best players of his generation. When the Dallas Stars won the Stanley Cup in 1999, Modano led all playoff performers in assists with 18, and then he did it again in the 2000 playoffs with 13. Modano finished his prolific career with 1,499 games played, and we should never forgive Mike Babcock for robbing him of 1,500.2. Chris Chelios, DGoals: 185Assists: 763Points: 948A true iron man, Chelios holds the record for most games played by an American-born player with 1,651. Throughout his 26 seasons, Chelios established a legacy as one of the greatest defensemen ever to hit the ice. He won the Norris Trophy three times, and he has three Stanley Cup rings (one with the Montreal Canadiens and two with the Detroit Red Wings). Between his production, accolades and longevity, Chelios was extremely close to taking the top spot in these rankings.1. Patrick Kane, RW*Goals: 500Assists: 869Points: 1,369Call it recency bias. Blame my age. Whatever the case, Kane is the best American-born player in NHL history right now, especially after joining the 500-goal club. Going beyond the raw numbers, and his Hart Trophy win, Kane's case is also built upon his ability to turn the Chicago Blackhawks from perennial losers into a semi-dynasty with three Stanley Cup wins in six seasons. In 136 career playoff games, he has 132 points, and he took home the Conn Smythe Trophy in 2015. Injuries plagued Kane toward the end of his tenure with the Blackhawks -- and they still have lingering effects today -- but he was a true superstar at his peak.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        If you want to defend the Washington Wizards' acquisition of Trae Young, as I did, you can point to the fact that they haven't turned over the franchise to him. It didn't cost the Wizards all that much to get Young, and, crucially, they didn't sign him to an extension as part of the deal. Young has a $49 million player option next season; assuming he picks it up, Washington can see how he fits with its core before even talking to him about sticking around beyond that.Without an extension, this is a low-risk move. If Young stunts the development of the up-and-coming Wizards rather than helping them grow, the team won't be stuck with him. There will be an opportunity cost -- Washington would have had a bunch of extra cap space had it simply let CJ McCollum's contract come off the books -- but, given that it still has a plenty of financial flexibility, it's not that big of a deal.If an extension is coming, though, the calculus changes. And it turns out that might be the case.ESPN's Shams Charania, in the news story about the trade, reported Wednesday that the Wizards were \"not expected\" to discuss an extension with Young right away. Two days later, ESPN's Tim Bontemps and Brian Windhorst reported that \"the strong expectation around the league\" is that there will be an extension, likening the acquisition to the Toronto Raptors' trade for Brandon Ingram at last year's trade deadline. Washington is reportedly hoping that its new point guard can do for its young players what Chris Paul did for the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2019-20 and what Fred VanVleet did for the Houston Rockets a couple of years ago.Generally speaking, I like this deal less for the Wizards if they sign Young to an extension. It means this is less let's take a flier on a primary playmaker and more we need this to work. But the devil is in the details. There's a massive difference, for example, between extending him on a near-max contract and extending him for, say, $30 million annually.\nAccording to the Dallas Hoops Journal's Grant Afseth, Washington is interested in signing Young to a three-year extension worth around $120 million, which is exactly the deal that Ingram got from Toronto.If they agree to something like that, I'd have questions: Does either side get an option on Year 3? Is it ascending, descending or a flat $40 million per season? I wouldn't love it for the Wizards, particularly if it's ascending and there's no team option.To be clear, though, any extension Young signs would begin next season. If the alternative is Young picking up his player option and making $49 million in 2026-27, then it effectively adds only two years, not three. A deal in the $140 million range would mean that Young will be paid less next season than he would otherwise. The question for Washington is whether this is a good investment for 2027-28 and 2028-29. It could be, especially if his jumper returns to form, but if I were in the front office, I'd push for a team option.\nYoung is on the Wizards' roster because his former team accepted that he had little trade value on his current contract. If they sign him to an extension, they need to be sure that they're not setting themselves up to be in the same position down the road.\n            ",

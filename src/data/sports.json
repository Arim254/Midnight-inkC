    "body": "\n        The 2026 Peach Bowl will see Big Ten teams squaring off on Friday as the No. 1 Indiana Hoosiers face the No. 5 Oregon Ducks. This 2026 College Football Playoff semifinal contest is a rematch of a mid-October game in which the Hoosiers prevailed on the road, 30-20. That remains the only loss for the 13-1 Ducks, who are coming off a dominant 23-0 shutout win over Texas Tech. As for the 14-0 Hoosiers, they are coming off a 38-3 blowout of Alabama and have aspirations of becoming the first 16-0 team in college football history. The winner of this matchup advances to take on Miami in the national title game on Jan. 19Kickoff is at 7:30 p.m. ET from Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. The Hoosiers are 3.5-point favorites in the latest Oregon vs. Indiana odds per SportsLine consensus. The over/under for total points is 48.5, having risen 2 points since the opening line.

The Ducks have also covered at at 75% clip as an underdog since 2023, while IU is just 5-4 ATS over its last nine versus Big Ten teams. On the field, Oregon possesses the better offense both on the ground and through the air. The Ducks average more passing yards than Indiana, with a higher completion percentage, in addition to averaging more rushing yards, as well as more yards per carry. On the other side of the ball, Oregon is coming off a season-high of four takeaways in the win over Texas Tech, and the Ducks had a pick-six of Fernando Mendoza in the first contest. Mendoza has also been under pressure as of late as he's been sacked three-plus times in four of his last five games. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why Indiana can coverNo one can match Indiana's production on both sides of the ball, as it has the No. 2 scoring defense and No. 3 scoring offense, and no other FBS team ranks in the top five of both. The Hoosiers have allowed two touchdowns, total, over their last four games, and they've given up a rushing touchdown in just one of their last nine games. Mendoza leads the nation with both 36 passing touchdowns and with a 184.7 passer rating, and Indiana isn't the type of team that hurts itself. Just one team in all of college football commits fewer penalty yards per game, while just two teams in the country commit fewer turnovers per game. Indiana appears to be the healthier team as well with Oregon running back Jordon Davison among the dozen players ruled out for the Ducks. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Indiana vs. Oregon picksSportsLine's model has simulated Oregon vs. Indiana 10,000 times and is going Under on the total, projecting 46 combined points.

Despite having a losing record, the Panthers are the home team as the NFC South champions, and despite not winning their division, the Rams have the second-shortest odds at the majority of sportsbooks to win the 2026 Super Bowl. The Rams are 10.5-point favorites over the Panthers in the latest NFL Wild Card Weekend odds, while the over/under is 46.5. The Packers are 1.5-point favorites against the Bears in an NFC North battle, with an over/under of 45.5 in the latest NFL odds. There are dozens of betting options if you're wondering how to bet on the NFL Wild Card Weekend, specifically on Rams vs. Panthers and Bears vs. Packers on Saturday.

SportsLine's proven computer model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model entered the 2026 NFL playoffs on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024.Saturday Wild Card Weekend betting preview, picksRams (-10.5) vs. PanthersThe Panthers defeated the Rams, 31-28, in Carolina in Week 13. However, a one-of-17 regular-season game and a win-or-go-home postseason contest are two completely different situations, and the model expects two completely different results. The Rams have the No. 1 scoring offense at 30.5 points per game this season, and the No. 10 scoring defense at 20.4 ppg allowed. Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford is the betting favorite to win the NFL MVP this year after leading the league in passing yards (4,707) and touchdowns (46) while throwing eight interceptions. Two of those eight interceptions came against the Panthers, and those are mistakes the 37-year-old quarterback is unlikely to make in a postseason game. The Panthers lost back-to-back games to end the season and made the playoffs after the Saints defeated the Falcons on Sunday, after Carolina lost to Tampa Bay the day before with the chance to lock up the division themselves. The model projects the Rams to cover in 53% of simulations. Bet on the Rams at FanDuel, where new users get $200 if your first bet of at least $5 wins:Bears (+1.5) vs. PackersThe Bears host the Packers on Saturday, and although it came via a fourth-quarter and overtime comeback, Chicago defeated Green Bay at Soldier Field, 22-16, less than a month ago. The Bears erased a 10-point deficit in the final two minutes of the fourth quarter to force overtime, and then defeated the Packers on a 46-yard touchdown from Caleb Williams to D.J. Moore in the extra period. Although it came late, Chicago showed how it can score points in bunches, and the Bears have the No. 9 scoring offense at 23.9 ppg in Ben Johnson's first season as the team's head coach. The Packers have lost four straight games in a streak that started the game in which Micah Parsons tore his ACL. Parsons was a significant defensive loss for the Packers, hindering the entire unit. The model projects the Bears to cover in 54% of simulations. Bet the Bears at Caesars Sportsbook, where new users get your first bet up to $250 in bonus bets, whether it wins or loses.Responsible gamingResponsible gaming is a serious topic, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users play responsibly.

    "body": "\nThe three-day 2026 NFL Wild Card Weekend kicks off on Saturday, and it's one of the most exciting times of the year for online sports betting. Many people will dabble in the traditional bets of picking the winner, against the spread and over/under for total points, but anytime touchdown scorer bets have become increasingly popular over the years. With six games over the next three days, many of the sport's biggest stars, including Davante Adams and Christian McCaffrey, will take the field, and the SportsLine Machine Learning Model has included these two in its NFL Wild Card Weekend anytime touchdown scorer best bets. Targeting anytime touchdown bets is one way to approach Wild Card Weekend NFL betting at online sports betting sites. With NFL props available for almost every player in every game at DraftKings, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model can help you find value to add to your Wild Card Weekend NFL picks. Wild Card Weekend NFL anytime touchdown picks:Davante Adams, Rams (-135)Rome Odunze, Bears (+220)Bhayshul Tuten, Jaguars (+260)Christian McCaffrey, 49ers (-130)TreVeyon Henderson, Patriots (+130)Woody Marks, Texans (+165)Davante Adams, Rams (-135)\nAdams is expected to return after missing the last three games with a hamstring injury. Despite playing just 14 games this season, he still led the NFL with 14 touchdown receptions, with at least one score in nine of 14 games after forming an immediate chemistry with Matthew Stafford. He had two touchdowns in the Rams' first meeting against the Panthers, and the model projects him to score in 65% of simulations, compared to his implied odds of 57.45%.Rome Odunze, Bears (+220)\nOdunze is also expected to make his return on Saturday after missing the last five games with a foot injury. The 23-year-old had six touchdowns over 12 games this season, including scoring in five different contests. He leads the Bears in receiving yards per game as Caleb Williams' top option when on the field, leading the model to project value in him at odds greater than 2-1. The model projects Odunze to score in 37% of simulations, compared to his implied odds of 31.25%.Bhayshul Tuten, Jaguars (+260)\nTuten scored a touchdown last week in his return from a two-game absence, marking the second straight game he played in where he scored a touchdown. He's scored in three of his last four games as he's become an increasingly important part of Jacksonville's offense. After scoring just two touchdowns over the first seven games, he has scored in five of his eight contests. The Bills have allowed the most rushing touchdowns (18) to running backs this season, and although Travis Etienne Jr. is the RB1, Tuten has proven the ability to score as well. The model projects him to score in 40% of simulations, showcasing strong value at his current price.Christian McCaffrey, 49ers (-130)\nMcCaffrey has been a touchdown machine over his career, and don't expect that usage to change in the biggest game of the season. The star San Francisco running back has stayed healthy throughout the season, resulting in 17 touchdowns in 17 games. He had 21 touchdowns in 16 games in 2023 in his last healthy season before this year, and McCaffrey scored five touchdowns in three games in their run to the Super Bowl that year. He scores in more than 60% of the model's simulations.TreVeyon Henderson, Patriots (+130)\nThe rookie has excelled since being given more opportunities about midway through the season, and with his big-play ability, he has touchdown potential every time he touches the ball. Henderson had two touchdowns last week against Miami, giving him four touchdowns over his last four games. Henderson scored nine of his 10 touchdowns over the final eight games of the season, and given his explosiveness, the model expects a heavier workload on Sunday. Henderson scores in 48% of simulations, creating value for anytime TD scorer bets at plus-money odds.Woody Marks, Texans (+165)\nMarks has taken over as the team's clear RB1 when healthy, and he appears to be at full health heading into Monday Night Football. The dynamic rookie could see a heavier workload in what will likely be a cold night in Pittsburgh, making the rushing attack a more popular option. The model projects him to score in 41% of simulations, with Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin likely to focus the defense on containing WR Nico Collins. Want more Wild Card Weekend NFL picks?You've seen the model's NFL picks for some top anytime touchdown scorer NFL player props for Wild Card Weekend.

    "body": "\n        The 2026 College Football Playoff semifinals conclude on Friday when the top-seeded Indiana Hoosiers take on the fifth-seeded Oregon Ducks. It's a rematch of the Oct. 11 meeting that Indiana won 30-20 at Oregon despite being a 7-point underdog entering that game. The Ducks beat James Madison and Texas Tech to advance to the CFP semifinals. Indiana had a bye and then stomped Alabama 38-3 in the quarterfinals. The winner of this matchup advances to face Miami in the national title game on January 19. Oregon running back Jordon Davison has been ruled out, while running back Noah Whittington is listed as questionable. Kickoff is at 7:30 p.m. ET from Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. The Hoosiers are 3.5-point favorites in the latest Oregon vs. Indiana odds from SportsLine consensus, while the over/under for total points scored is 48.5. Before making any Indiana vs. Oregon picks, make sure to see the College Football Playoff semifinal predictions from SportsLine's Micah Roberts. New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your initial bet wins:Roberts has worked in the Las Vegas sportsbook industry for 20-plus years, including a 13-year run as Station Casinos' book director.

Indiana also knocked off Ohio State in the Big Ten Championship Game despite entering that matchup as a 3.5-point underdog. Both sides of the ball are performing at a high level, but the defense has been particularly dominant in the past two games, holding Alabama and Ohio State to a combined 13 points. Quarterback Fernando Mendoza, the Heisman winner and likely top overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, leads a balanced offense that features two 800-yard backs and two 700-yard receivers. The Hoosiers have already knocked off Oregon once by double digits, and that was on the road, so they should be extremely confident entering this one. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why Oregon can cover It's tough to beat a great team twice, and that's what Indiana will be attempting to do. This is the sixth rematch of a regular season game in College Football Playoff history, and four of the previous five have been won by the team that lost in the regular season. If Indiana was the most dominant team in the quarterfinals, the Ducks weren't too far behind. Oregon stifled Texas Tech's offense, forcing four turnovers and giving up just 215 total yards of offense. Offensively, the Ducks can boast many of the same qualities that Indiana can, including a likely first-round pick at quarterback in Dante Moore. Tight end Kenyon Sadiq, another possible first-round pick, leads the Ducks with 46 receptions and eight touchdown catches. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Indiana vs. Oregon picksRoberts has analyzied Oregon vs. Indiana and is leaning Over on the total.

However, both teams' defenses actually rank even higher than their offenses in total scoring, with Indiana having the No. 2 scoring defense at 11.1 points per game allowed, and Oregon sixth at 15.3 ppg. Neither team allowed a touchdown in its quarterfinal games despite challenging matchups, with Indiana playing Alabama and Oregon going against Texas A&M. These two teams combined for 50 points in their regular-season matchup, but with this being the second time they meet, plus the increased attention to detail in preparing for a semifinal, the model projects a lower-scoring matchup tonight.

    "body": "\n        Next week provides a scheduling quirk that could have significant fantasy implications. While the majority of teams play three or four games, there are four teams that will play just twice each. There is also one team that will play five games. Let's keep the schedule in mind as we target some players to add off the waiver wire who are still available in the majority of CBS leagues.Egor Demin, Brooklyn Nets (44% rostered)Demin has averaged just 25 minutes per game during his rookie season, but he has played more lately. Across his last nine games, he has averaged 29 minutes. With more playing time in hand, Demin provided 15.3 points, 3.8 rebounds, 3.3 assists, one steal, and 3.6 3-pointers during that span. He also improved his efficiency compared to his season numbers, shooting 43.8% from the field and 43.8% from behind the arc.The Nets are one of the worst teams in the league, so they have nothing left to play for other than improving their lottery odds. That means that not only does Demin have fantasy appeal for their upcoming four-game week, but he's also someone to consider rostering for the long haul. Around 30 minutes a game could be coming his way on a regular basis.Moussa Diabate, Charlotte Hornets (40% rostered)Ryan Kalkbrenner (elbow) has missed 10 straight games for the Hornets. The team hasn't given any positive updates regarding his recovery, so consider him out indefinitely for the time being. Diabate played in eight of the games that Kalkbrenner was sidelined, averaging 8.7 points, 10.7 rebounds, and 2.4 assists.\nThe key to Diabate's increase in production is that he has logged 32 minutes per game since Kalkbrenner got hurt, compared to his season average of 24 minutes. Diabate has always been a good rebounder, which was evident when he grabbed 6.2 rebounds over just 18 minutes per game last season. The Hornets play four games next week, so Diabate could provide fantasy managers with a significant boost in rebounds.Jake LaRavia, Los Angeles Lakers (36% rostered)Rui Hachimura (calf) has missed five straight games for the Lakers. LaRavia started each game that he missed, averaging 15.4 points, 6.0 rebounds, two steals, and 2.4 3-pointers. He logged a whopping 37 minutes per game during that span, which is a huge increase over his season average of 27 minutes a night.It's important to note that Hachimura practiced with the Lakers' G League team Wednesday, so his return might be imminent. However, that doesn't mean that LaRavia still isn't worth rostering. The Lakers are the lone team that will play five games next week. Those five games include two back-to-back sets. It would be a surprise if LeBron James played in more than four of those games, and he might not play more than three. Even if Hachimura is back by then, he could sit out a game or two for rest. LaRavia should still play enough to be able to provide value. \nCollin Murray-Boyles, Toronto Raptors (18% rostered)Murray-Boyles has averaged 28 minutes across his last six games, which is a significant increase from his season average of 20 minutes. He has taken advantage of his added opportunities, averaging eight points, 9.7 rebounds, 2.7 assists, 1.5 steals, and 1.3 blocks. Not only did Murray-Boyles play well, but the Raptors went 5-1 during that span. That certainly helps Murray-Boyles' case to remain in this increased role moving forward.Jakob Poeltl (back) being out has been beneficial to Murray-Boyles. Poeltl returned to practice Thursday, so he might be close to taking the floor again with the Raptors. His return wouldn't be a benefit for Murray-Boyles, but the Raptors do play four games next week. That's enough for Murray-Boyles to be worth rostering in deeper formats.Marcus Smart, Los Angeles Lakers (15% rostered)Smart hasn't exactly been shining with his averages of 9.5 points, three rebounds, and 3.1 assists this season. However, he has chipped in 1.4 steals and 1.5 3-pointers per game. The Lakers need him on the floor for defense, which has resulted in him playing 28 minutes per game. Gabe Vincent made his return from a back injury Wednesday, but he likely won't have a significant negative impact on Smart's role.\nSince Smart doesn't score a ton or provide a lot in terms of rebounds and assists, he's strictly someone to consider for steals and 3-pointers when the schedule works in his favor. That's exactly the case next week with the Lakers playing five times. Among those games are favorable matchups against the Kings and Hornets. If there was ever a week to feel good about streaming Smart, this is it.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Fight sports are a funny thing. The goal is simple: hurt your opponent. It's something that everyone understands. But the sportification of mixed martial arts introduces rules and concepts that sometimes confuse UFC viewers.There is no need to explain why Conor McGregor became the featherweight champion after knocking out Jose Aldo at UFC 194, or who the victor was when McGregor tapped to Khabib Nurmagomedov at UFC 229. But, whether Alexander Volkanovski truly beat Max Holloway in their second meeting? That one will be endlessly debated. UFC is more accessible than ever before under the new Paramount+ partnership. Before the new era takes off, beginning with UFC 324 on Jan. 24, let's take a deep dive or refresher course on how UFC fights are won, what moves are illegal, how rounds are scored, and what it takes to become a UFC champion. More UFC Fan Guide: Brief history of the sport | Active fighters to know | Most exciting fights to watch ahead of UFC 324\nHow fights are wonMethods of victory fall under one of four categories: knockouts, submissions, decisions and disqualifications. Let's break down each of them. Knockout: The most common striking finishes are a KO or technical knockout (TKO). A KO ruling is made when a fighter cannot intelligently defend themselves. A TKO is different because a fighter is not intelligently defending themselves. A referee will often intervene with a TKO stoppage when a conscious fighter is visibly hurt and doing little more than covering up under a barrage of strikes. TKOs are also awarded if there's a doctor stoppage, a corner stoppage (e.g., throwing in the towel), or a fighter fails to answer the bell to begin a round. Doctor stoppages are usually rendered because of severe lacerations or injuries that compromise a fighter's ability to compete safely.Submission: There are three subcategories for submission rulings. The most common is a physical tap out, where an opponent uses their body, most often in the form of short, rapid taps with their hand, to indicate surrender. Verbal tapouts are more nuanced. A fighter can verbally announce their surrender, but a voluntary or involuntary screen of pain or distress also counts. Lastly, there are technical submissions, where a submission move renders the opponent unconscious or breaks/dislocates their bones or joints.\nDecision: Each fight is scored by three judges at Octagon side. Four different decision outcomes can result in a winner. A unanimous decision is read when all three judges score the fight in favor of one fighter. A split decision occurs when two judges score the fight for one combatant, and the other judge scores it for the opponent. A majority decision is similar, with two judges scoring the fight for one contestant, but the dissenting judge scoring a draw. Technical decisions are very rare. If a fight is stopped prematurely because of an injury from an accidental foul, and the majority of the rounds have been completed (two rounds in a three-round fight, or three rounds in a five-round fight), a winner will be determined based on the scorecards at that point. This happened last February when Henry Cejudo, the recipient of unintentional eye pokes, was unable to continue after Round 3 of his main event fight. There are also two conditions for fights that result in no winner: a no-contest or a draw. A no-contest occurs when a fight is stopped prematurely due to an accidental foul, and the conditions for a technical decision have not been reached. There are various types of draws, but they all amount to the same core principle: no fighter has an edge on more than one judge's scorecard.\nDisqualifications: The intentionality of fouls is a hot-button topic in MMA. Referees are hesitant to penalize fighters, often resulting in situations where even repeat fouls are deemed unintentional. DQs are rarely exercised for this reason. A fighter can be disqualified if they injure their opponent with a severe intentional foul -- this is the most common utilization of the rule. DQs can also occur if a fighter commits multiple fouls or flagrantly disregards the rules or referee's commands, but good luck seeing that happen.What's illegal in MMA?MMA is a legitimate and widely accepted sport. Use this guide as trivia the next time your grandmother asks you why you're watching that barbaric, \"no-holds-barred\" cagefighting at Christmas dinner. There are many different types of fouls in MMA, far too many to list here. Some of the most significant ones are head-butting, eye-gouging, groin attacks, and biting. Determining whether fouls are intentional or not, and how referees reprimand fighters, is a sticking point for the previously mentioned debate. It doesn't have to be a DQ or nothing situation. Referees can penalize fighters by deducting points for severe or repeated fouls. It's rarely done, but there seems to be an uptick in referee intervention after recent, high-profile eye poke situations, like Tom Aspinall at UFC 320, where he was unable to continue from an apparent accidental foul. Even extending fingers forward to an opponent's face or eyes is already considered a foul. \nNumerous location-specific strikes are also illegal. Strikes to the spine, throat, and the back of the head are off limits. Kicking or kneeing a grounded fighter is also illegal. A fighter is considered grounded if any part of their body, other than their hands or feet, is on the mat. The rule was updated in 2024 to stop fighters from intentionally placing one hand on the mat -- at the time, a qualifier for being \"grounded\" -- thus gaming the system. The Association of Boxing Commissions also legalized 12-6 elbows, a move that famously resulted in the only loss, a DQ ruling, of Jon Jones' career.While most state athletic commissions followed suit with the ABC's updates, they are not explicitly required to. A small handful of commissions have held onto older versions of the rule, creating a perplexing situation for fighters and viewers.How rounds are scored (and why it's confusing)Scoring criteria is probably the most confusing and divisive subject among fans, fighters and analysts. In 2022, CBS Sports published a long-form feature with multiple experts breaking down the issues with it.\nUFC fights are contested across three five-minute rounds. The exceptions come in championship fights, main events and some special attractions that are held for a maximum of five five-minute rounds. Each round is scored independently. Whatever success you have in Round 1 bears no numeric influence on how judges score subsequent rounds. Three judges sit Octagonside, working separately from one another. Should the fight reach the final buzzer, their scorecards are tabulated, round-by-round, to determine a winner. Most often, whoever wins the majority of the rounds wins the fight, but that's where things get confusing. Each judge awards 10 points to the fighter they believe won the round, with their opponent earning nine or fewer. In close rounds, this means judges might submit contradictory scores. A round too close to call, and one with a clear winner, can both be scored 10-9. This is because judges are disincentivized from scoring 10-10 rounds, and the margin between a nine and an eight is wide. A fighter can win a round 10-8 if they are dominant and create a large gap between winning and losing the round. This is where MMA and boxing differ as a boxer can win a round 10-8 by scoring a knockdown.So, how are rounds actually scored? This is where things get messy. The Unified MMA Rules, the system UFC adopts for most of its fights, has a hierarchical criteria system: effective striking/grappling, effective aggressiveness and control of the fighting area, in that order. Think of it as having a Plan A, B, and C. If the judges can determine which fighter fulfilled the condition for Plan A more effectively, Plan B or C isn't considered. \n\"Effective\" is another important word in the language. Holding onto your opponent for dear life, or clamping down on a position, shouldn't net you much favor with the judges. \"Effective\" fighting involves progressing to a finish. Think hard strikes, legitimate submission attempts, or advancing to more advantageous positions on the ground. The judges are told to reward these actions. You can begin to see the nuance and elements of subjectivity that creep into objective scoring. Take a closer look at effective striking, for example. Effective striking is defined as \"impact/effect of legal strikes\" with the immediate outweighing the cumulative. A knockdown punch or strike that wobbles an opponent is more valuable than a handful of jabs. But what if someone lands one lucky punch in a round where they were severely outstruck? This is where nuance creeps in. Naturally, the damage accrued by striking will often be seen as more valuable than submission attempts, unless the opponent escaped by the narrowest window. If your head hurts, that's OK, but try to keep these principles in mind. Rounds are scored independently; most rounds will be scored 10-9, and the round winner is the person who most effectively progressed the fight towards a finish through impact, dominance, and duration.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Retirement is looming for LeBron James, but no one knows when that day will come -- even Rich Paul, his agent and closest professional confidant. The 41-year-old James hasn't ruled out playing another year or two, at least publicly, and is shooting 51.2% from the floor this season, just above his career average, as the Los Angeles Lakers enter Friday night at 23-12 overall, good for fifth in the Western Conference.\"Everyone's like, 'do the farewell,' and it's his last year and this and that,\" Paul said during this week's \"Game Over\" podcast. \"But like, I don't know what it is, but I hope it is not his last year. I hope it's not his last year, [but] I don't talk to him about it.\"James said before the season he has a \"timeline\" on an announcement, but hasn't revealed that yet. The four-time NBA champion is playing a career-low 33.3 minutes per game, yet is still averaging 21.7 points, 5.4 rebounds and 6.8 assists as one of the Lakers' most important players.\n        \n            \n                LeBron James celebrates 41st birthday: Lakers superstar still proving things on the court as retirement looms\n                \n                    John Gonzalez                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nPaul said there's a chance James could extend his career with the Lakers if he's willing to settle into his current role, a secondary option behind Luka Dončić.\n\"I am a little jaded. Because I made a comment before, I said that, obviously, the ceiling is who he is, or who he has been for his career, but the floor is Karl Malone,\" Paul said. \"If LeBron just decided to set screens and pop... if Deandre Ayton sets a screen, they're going to blitz Luka and make Deandre Ayton make a decision. If LeBron sets the screen, you pretty much have to switch it. Because if you blitz him, now he is short rolling as the decision maker.\"James admitted this week that Los Angeles' offense works better through Dončić.\"Luka don't need to bend his game [for me],\" James said. \"Luka is our franchise for this ballclub. He don't need to bend his game. It's up to us to bend our game around him and figure it out.\"We just try to be dynamic and work off of him. We know he is an unbelievable pick-and-roll player, unbelievable shotmaker. He commands the defense. He has four eyes, sometimes six eyes on him. So, it's up to us to put ourselves in the right position. ... It's not a problem for me; it's not an issue for me.\"James missed the first month of the season with sciatica while Dončić carried the franchise in his absence. He's averaging a league-leading 33.7 points per game, which is only a step behind his brilliance in 2023-24 with the Dallas Mavericks. \nDončić has been exactly what the Lakers have needed alongside James, a player he can eventually pass the torch to upon his exit from the NBA.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        For the United States men's national team, much of 2025 was spent worrying about whether they would be up to the task at hand of performing in a World Cup on home soil. They were struggling to score, defend, and lacked any real identity under new manager Mauricio Pochettino. It wasn't until September that things began to change, when Tristan Blackmon, Tim Ream and Chris Richards all started together in a back three for the first time in a friendly against Japan. It would lead to a 2-0 victory which sparked a five match unbeaten run to close out 2025, a run where the USMNT faced five sides who will all be in action at the World Cup.The shift is something that impressed Ream, who spoke about it on Call it What you Want, a CBS Sports Golazo network podcast.\"I think it was a stroke of genius to have three center backs. But in doing that, I think it unlocked the thought of guys being able to play in a fluid four for whatever reason, we went to three center backs, we seemed a lot more comfortable,\" Ream said.He's right as the change in defending not only helped provide defensive cover, but it also allowed fullbacks to push further forward into the attack, giving support to Christian Pulisic and Folarin Balogun to put the ball in the net. It created a more repeatable system and added flexibility for the USMNT to go back to a back four if needed.\n\"Flexibility gives us incredible options to change on the fly in game... it gives guys a better understanding of what everybody needs, but it gives them a better understanding of positionally where they should be at all times,\" Ream said.\nWhy was the shift needed?Without Tyler Adams, the USMNT tried out different midfielders to see if they could operate as adequate shields for the defense, and they came to the same conclusion that Bournemouth are coming to in the Premier League. Adams is irreplaceable in a one to one shift, so changing the system was needed to make it happen. It shows Pochettino ensuring that he's creating the best system for the players at his disposal instead of trying to force something that isn't working on his team. Calling in 70 different players during his time so far as manager, Pochettino has taken a deep look at the squad, and at the moment, this is the best available setup. Adams is currently recovering from an MCL injury with Bournemouth, so even during the March international break, Pochettino could need to continue seeing how to operate without his best defensive midfielder.\nRaising the barOn the bright side, the shift has given the USMNT an identity and made the system repeatable. Even with Pochettino changing the players in his XI from game to game, performance levels didn't drop off, and players knew what was expected from them tactically. It's a departure from when players sometimes didn't understand what their roles were during the end of Gregg Berhalter's tenure as manager. With time to spare ahead of the World Cup, Pochettino has been able to instill his tactics, which are about to be put to the test in upcoming March friendlies facing Belgium and Portugal. It's an important step to getting past the round of 16 and the USMNT are on the right track under the Argentine.\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe NFL playoff field seedings have been set, and the road to Super Bowl 60 begins this weekend with six playoff games, three each in the AFC and NFC.The Seahawks are the +300 favorites to lift the Lombardi Trophy among the 14 teams, according to DraftKings. They have the most desired path to the big game on Feb. 8 as the top seed in the NFC. Denver, the No. 1 seed in the AFC, is the +650 third favorite, with Seattle's NFC West rival the Los Angeles Rams the +425 second choice.Seattle has the clearest path to the Super Bowl, but some other teams could have an edge based on matchups. The SportsLine Inside the Lines team and Projection Model have crunched the numbers and identified the Seahawks' and every other NFC team's most favorable path to the title. And according to the model, all of the NFC teams, with the exception of the Rams, have one thing in common: They should all be rooting for the Panthers.SeahawksSeattle being the Super Bowl favorite is no surprise. As the No. 1 seed in the NFC, Sam Darnold and the Seahawks are enjoying a bye week and will have home field advantage throughout the playoffs. The Projection Model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, gives Seattle at least a 50.9% chance to beat every other team still alive in the postseason. But the model says that the Seahawks should be big fans of Carolina on Saturday against the Rams. According to the model, Seattle has a better chance to win against the Panthers (74.4%) than any team remaining in the playoffs, including the perceived worst teams in the AFC. In addition, a Carolina win would knock out the Rams, who have the best chance (43.6%) to beat the Seahawks of all of the NFC squads in the model's simulations. Los Angeles and Seattle split their two matchups this year, with each team winning at home.Should the Seahawks get to the Super Bowl, the model gives Jacksonville the best chance against them, at 49.1%.OpponentSeahawks' average win %Bears68.5Eagles57.6Panthers74.4Rams56.449ers65.9Packers65.8Bears\nThe Projection Model is not a big fan of the NFC North champs. Even though Chicago is the No. 2 seed in the NFC, the model says Caleb Williams & Co. have a better than 50.0% chance to win against only the Panthers (67.1%), Packers (54.5%) and 49ers (52.8%) in the NFC. So the Bears will be rooting hard for Carolina over the Rams on Saturday prior to taking the field against rival Green Bay. (Chicago is a 1.5-point underdog at DraftKings despite playing at home.)If the Bears navigate the NFC to get to the Super Bowl, the model gives them a better than 50-50 chance against only one AFC team: the Chargers. OpponentBears' average win %Seahawks31.5Eagles47.1Panthers67.1Rams44.949ers52.8Packers54.5Eagles\nLike the rest of the teams in the NFC, the reigning Super Bowl champions would be best served if they didn't have to face the Seahawks. According to the Projection Model Philadelphia would have at least a 52.9% chance against any NFC team not named Seattle. And in a matchup between the No. 2-seeded Bears and the No. 3-seeded Eagles, the model prefers Philadelphia even though that game would be played in Chicago.Interestingly, the Eagles are one of two NFC teams (the Panthers are the other) that the model says would have their worst chance against the Texans over any other AFC team in the Super Bowl.OpponentEagles' average win %Seahawks42.4Bears52.9Panthers70.1Rams55.549ers60.6Packers61.5Panthers\nCarolina is the longest shot at DraftKings to win the Super Bowl (+20000), and the Projection Model agrees that the Panthers' road to lifting the Lombardi will be tough. But just how tough? According to the model, Carolina has only a 24.4% chance to beat the Rams on Saturday, even though the Panthers already beat the Rams this season, 31-28. That's Carolina's worst average win percentage against any team remaining in the playoffs, even worse than having to face the top-seeded Seahawks in Seattle (25.6%).But since we're discussing hypotheticals, let's throw out the most unlikely hypothetical of them all. If the Panthers knock off Los Angeles on Saturday, their dream path to the Super Bowl title would be a Divisional Round matchup against the 49ers, an NFC Championship Game meeting against the Packers and a Super Bowl battle against the Chargers.OpponentPanthers' average win %Seahawks25.6Bears32.9Eagles29.9Rams24.449ers36.0Packers39.1Rams\nThe Projection Model loves L.A. The simulations give Matthew Stafford & Co. the third-best chance to win the Super Bowl (10.0%), behind only the Seahawks (22.3%) and Broncos (16.2%) despite being a wild card team and the No. 5 seed in the NFC. Interestingly, the model says Los Angeles would have almost as difficult a time against the Eagles (44.5%) as it would against the Seahawks (43.6%). The Rams, however, would have a much easier time against the Bears (55.1%).If Los Angeles gets to Santa Clara, the model likes the team's chances against all but two AFC teams: the Jaguars and Texans. OpponentRams' average win %Seahawks43.6Bears55.1Eagles44.5Panthers75.649ers61.0Packers63.549ers\nLosing the Week 18 showdown against the Seahawks really diminished San Francisco's chances to reach — and win — the Super Bowl. According to the Projection Model, the 49ers, who now have to face the Eagles in Philadelphia instead of being at home for the rest of the postseason, have a better than 50% chance to beat only two NFC teams: the Panthers (64.0) and Packers (53.4). And if San Francisco beats the Eagles on Sunday, there's a more than significant chance that the 49ers will have to knock off either or both NFC West postseason rivals, the Seahawks and Rams, to get to the Super Bowl.If San Francisco gets to the big game, the 49ers will have the advantage of playing at home, at Levi's Stadium. But that advantage may not be as big as you may think. The model gives them a better than 50% chance of winning against just two AFC teams: the Chargers (55.3%) and Steelers (53.8%).Opponent49ers' average win %Seahawks34.1Bears47.2Eagles39.4Panthers64.0Rams39.0Packers53.4Packers\nWith Green Bay the No. 7 seed in the seven-team NFC bracket, the team's path is pretty well laid out. If the Packers beat the Bears on Saturday, Jordan Love & Co. will have to face the top-seeded Seahawks in Seattle in the Divisional Round. The Projection Model gives the Packers a 45.5% chance to conquer Chicago and just a 34.2% chance to slay the Seahawks.The good news? If Green Bay reaches the NFC Championship Game, the road gets easier; no remaining possible opponent offers a more difficult matchup for Green Bay than Seattle, according to the model.OpponentPackers' average win %Seahawks34.2Bears45.5Eagles38.5Panthers60.9Rams36.549ers46.6\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe turn of a new year is marked by FA Cup third-round action in England, the country's most historic cup competition set to welcome all 20 Premier League teams for a jam-packed weekend of matches beginning Friday.A majority of the 20 Premier League clubs will be facing off against lower league opposition, though not all cup ties are created equal. New Chelsea manager Liam Rosenior will take charge of his first game against Charlton Athletic, a mismatch that could allow the 41-year-old to settle into his new role ahead of a busy stretch of fixtures. Nottingham Forest's trip to Wrexham, though, does not exactly inspire comparisons to David and Goliath -- a battle between a relegation contender in one division and a promotion hopeful in the next league down means chatter of an upset is hard to avoid.Some Premier League clubs, though, will be facing off against each other. The list includes Aston Villa's visit to Tottenham Hotspur, a faceoff between two teams in very different form, and Brighton and Hove Albion's trip to Manchester United as the Red Devils settle into life without recently fired manager Ruben Amorim.Here's what to keep an eye on ahead of a busy weekend in England.FA Cup third round TV scheduleAll times U.S./EasternFriday, Jan. 9MK Dons vs. Oxford United, 2:30 p.m. (ESPN+)Preston North End vs. Wigan Athletic, 2:30 p.m. (ESPN+)Wrexham vs. Nottingham Forest, 2:30 p.m. (ESPN+)Port Vale vs. Fleetwood Town, 2:30 p.m. (ESPN+)Saturday, Jan. 10Macclesfield Town vs. Crystal Palace, 7:15 a.m. (ESPN+)Everton vs. Sunderland, 7:15 a.m. (ESPN2)Wolverhampton Wanderers vs. Shrewsbury Town, 7:15 a.m. (ESPN+)Cheltenham Town vs. Leicester City, 7:15 p.m. (ESPN+)Doncaster Rovers vs. Southampton, 10 a.m. (ESPN+)Stoke City vs. Coventry City, 10 a.m. (ESPN+)Sheffield Wednesday vs. Brentford, 10 a.m. (ESPN+)Newcastle United vs. Bournemouth, 10 a.m. (ESPN+)Fulham vs. Middlesbrough, 10 a.m. (ESPN+)Ipswich Town vs. Blackpool, 10 a.m. (ESPN+)Manchester City vs. Exeter City, 10 a.m. (ESPN+)Burnley vs. Millwall, 10 a.m. (ESPN+)Boreham Wood vs. Burton Albion, 10 a.m. (ESPN+)Salford City vs. Swindon Town, 10 a.m. (ESPN+)Cambridge United vs. Birmingham City, 12:45 p.m. (ESPN+)Tottenham Hotspur vs. Aston Villa, 12:45 p.m. (ESPN+)Grimsby Town vs. Weston-super-Mare, 12:45 p.m. (ESPN+)Bristol City vs. Watford, 12:45 p.m. (ESPN+)Charlton Athletic vs. Chelsea, 3 p.m. (ESPN+)Sunday, Jan. 11Derby County vs. Leeds United, 7 a.m. (ESPN+)Portsmouth vs. Arsenal, 9 a.m. (ESPN2)Hull City vs. Blackburn Rovers, 9:30 a.m. (ESPN+)Swansea vs. West Bromwich Albion, 9:30 a.m. (ESPN+)Norwich City vs. Walsall, 9:30 a.m. (ESPN+)West Ham United vs. Queens Park Rangers, 9:30 a.m. (ESPN+)Sheffield United vs. Mansfield Town, 9:30 a.m. (ESPN+)Manchester United vs. Brighton and Hove Albion, 11:30 a.m. (ESPN+)Monday, Jan. 12Liverpool vs. Barnsley, 2:45 p.m. (ESPN+)Liam Rosenior's Chelsea debutDays after officially joining Chelsea on a five-and-a-half year deal, Liam Rosenior will make his touchline debut for the Blues with an FA Cup tie at Charlton Athletic on Saturday. It is currently unclear what exactly to expect, though – BlueCo, the consortium that owns both Chelsea and Rosenior's ex-club Strasbourg, have put a lot of stock in the England native and from a stylistic standpoint, his philosophy is not a great departure from Enzo Maresca's. Rosenior is inheriting a team that has been inconsistent at times this season, currently sitting eighth in the Premier League but in the midst of a top four race in which fourth place Liverpool and 10th place Sunderland are separated by just four points. A clash against Charlton, who currently sit 19th in the Championship, offers a favorable start for Rosenior before an important batch of matches -- his first weeks in the most high-profile job of his managerial career include the two-legged EFL Cup semifinal against Arsenal, as well as final league phase matches in the UEFA Champions League against Pafos and Napoli.A tale of two contrasting teamsFA Cup third round action includes a couple of matchups between Premier League sides, including Aston Villa's trip to Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday. Villa have just one loss in their last 16 matches and will be favored in this tie, which comes in the midst of a strong league campaign that currently sees them in third place and equal on points with title contender Manchester City. Spurs, meanwhile, are one of several Premier League teams in the midst of a rocky period, but unlike many of the others, have chosen to stick by manager Thomas Frank. They have just one win in their last six, a signal that Frank has yet to properly instill an identity halfway through his first season in charge – and is not a good sign ahead of what could be one of the more evenly-contested FA Cup ties of the third round.Upset watch in Wales?Nottingham Forest will be the favorites at Wrexham in one of the weekend's first games on Friday but if recent form means anything, the Premier League side may be at risk of an early exit in the FA Cup. Forest have just one win in their last five and are much closer to the relegation race than they were a year ago, when they finished high enough to qualify for European competition, though the seven point cushion between them and 18th place West Ham may be enough to assuage fears of dropping down a division for the time being. Wrexham, meanwhile, are finding their footing in the Championship and have won four in a row, bringing them up to ninth in the league and one point outside of a promotion playoff spot. An upset might be a big ask for the Wales-based club but the opportunity is certainly ripe, especially for a Forest team that might depiroitize the FA Cup after a busy festive period in the Premier League and ahead of their final matches in the Europa League's league phase.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        If we've learned anything from the first week of 2026, it's that no opponent should be overlooked in women's college basketball. While there are multiple examples we could mention, Ole Miss stole the spotlight on Thursday night with its 74-69 upset over No. 5 Oklahoma.The No. 18 Rebels almost upset No. 2 Texas on Sunday, but ultimately fell 67-64. Coach Yolett McPhee-McCuin was grateful for that experience because it sparked the fire her team needed to get the job against the Sooner days later.\"I was really grateful for the Texas loss,\" she said postgame. \"The Texas game, I thought it prepared us for tonight. After we lost to Texas, I told my team, if they're No. 2, I guess we are No. 3. We just never stopped believing in ourselves. This is just the beginning.\"\nCoach Yo's Rebels are known for how hard they fight, but they don't want to be known as the comeback team – they want to throw the first punch. That's how they managed to get a road victory against a tough opponent in Norman.\nIt all started with a defensive clinic in the first quarter. The Rebels held Oklahoma to just 11 points in the first 10 minutes and just 5 of 22 shooting from the field. The Sooners had three turnovers and zero field goals in the first six minutes of the game. Their leading scorers Aaliyah Chavez and Raegan Beers were a combined 1 of 10 shooting in that period.Chavez eventually finished the night with 26 points, while Raegan Beers registered her sixth consecutive double-double with 15 points and 20 rebounds. However, Ole Miss was able to disrupt Beers's game enough to limit her to a single field goal attempt in the third quarter. Oklahoma found its first lead of the game almost five minutes into the fourth quarter while going on a 7-0 run. The win could've gotten away from Ole Miss at that point, but the Rebels refused to back down.\n\"We've just been working on just being the tougher team,\" Cotie McMahon, who led Ole Miss' offense with 22 points, said postgame. \"Practice has been, we gotta push through. The stuff Coach Yo has been having us doing this week literally was for moments like this. We just had to push through our breaking point and make sure we don't have a breaking point, we keep pushing. Keep pushing.\"\nFor those who have not been following along, Ole Miss is coming off its second Sweet 16 appearance in three years. However, this is practically a whole new team with nine newcomers and only three returners. The SEC is currently the toughest conference to play in, but the Rebels have put everyone on notice.Here are some other noteworthy recent events and the top games to watch this weekend:Kentucky falls to AlabamaThe Wildcats climbed to No. 6 in the AP Top 25 poll after upsetting LSU last week. However, they found themselves on the wrong side of an upset on Thursday with a 64-51 loss to Alabama. While the Crimson Tide are not currently ranked, they have been receiving votes. \nKentucky was playing without starting forward Teonni Key (elbow), and it didn't help that leading scorer Clara Strack had an off game with only four points while going 1 of 14 from the field.\"We were very disconnected,\" Kentucky head coach Kenny Brooks said after the game. \"I don't want to sound like the sky is falling, but it was one of the worst games that we've had collectively. We just weren't together. Actually had a really good start, just couldn't capitalize on it.\"Flau'jae Johnson bounces backLSU started SEC play 0-2 with losses to Kentucky and Vanderbilt last week. Flau'jae Johnson particularly struggled against Vanderbilt as she went scoreless and rolled her ankle.\nOn Thursday, the Tigers finally got into the winning column with an 80-59 victory over Georgia. Johnson led the way with a season-high 25 points. In the process, she became just the ninth player in program history to surpass 1,800 career points.\"This is a different situation for me. I've never ever in my life started SEC play on a losing trajectory,\"Johnson said. \"So for me, having that experience, I just came into the game with the utmost confidence in myself but on my team as well... I'm just trying to pour into them and let them know, like coach said, the sky is not falling. We're going to be OK, it's January. It's the beginning of January. We got a lot of basketball to play.\"\nClemson gets first win over NC State in 15 yearsClemson got a 75-65 win over NC State with Rachael Rose's 19 points leading the five Tigers who scored in double figures. This was Clemson's first win over NC State since 2011. \nWhile NC State wasn't officially ranked in the AP Top 25, the Wolfpack was receiving votes and had cracked the CBS Sports power rankings. The SEC and Big Ten have received a lot of the attention this season, but the ACC has also been quite intriguing.\nJaloni Cambridge has career night in front of A'ja WilsonJaloni Cambridge registered a career-high 41 points in Ohio State's 78-69 win over Illinois on Wednesday. She became the first Buckeye to reach 40+ points against a Big Ten opponent since Kelsey Mitchell scored 43 against Rutgers on March 4, 2016.Even more exciting is the fact that she did this in front of WNBA star A'ja Wilson, which was a dream come true for Jaloni and her sister/teammate Kennedy.\n\"She [Wilson] told me I had a good game,\" Cambridge said. \"So, I think I'm going to take that and run with that for rest of my life, no matter how bad I play. She told me I had a good game, so that is all that matters.\"\nGames to watch this weekendAll times are Eastern TimeNo. 17 Texas Tech at Cincinnati -- Saturday at 2 p.m. on ESPN+Texas Tech is off to its best start in program history and is currently one of just four undefeated women's basketball teams remaining. Cincinnati is not ranked but the Bearcats can't be taken lightly as they pulled off a 71-63 upset against No. 11 Iowa State on Wednesday.No. 22 North Carolina at Notre Dame -- Sunday at 1 p.m. on ESPNNorth Carolina lost to Stanford in overtime last weekend, while Notre Dame fell out of the AP Top 25 this week following back-to-back losses to Georgia Tech and Duke. These two teams are hungry to bounce back, which means this could be a competitive ACC battle.\nNo. 2 Texas at No. 12 LSU -- 3 p.m. on ESPNVic Schaefer's Longhorns arrived to Baton Rouge with a perfect 18-0 record, but they can't take anything for granted -- especially when facing a Kim Mulkey team looking to prove they can still compete against the best in the SEC.No. 5 Oklahoma at No. 6 Kentucky -- 4 p.m on SEC NetworkKentucky's loss to Alabama was arguably worse than Oklahoma falling to Ole Miss. The Wildcats will be at home doing their best to shake off their offensive struggles.No. 19 Ohio State at No. 8 Maryland -- 4 p.m. on PeacockMaryland is fresh off an 88-41 victory over Rutgers in which the Terrapins registered 16 3-pointers with Yarden Garzon going a perfect 6 of 6 from beyond the arc. Meanwhile, Ohio State's Jaloni Cambridge has bragging rights for a lifetime after scoring 41 points in front of A'ja Wilson.\nDuke at Stanford -- 5 p.m. on ESPNNeither of these teams are currently ranked but both have experience against some of the top teams in the nation. Duke dropped out of the rankings earlier this season, but it seems like the Blue Devils are getting back on the right path. Stanford has been on a roller coaster this season, so this is a great matchup for both of them to figure out where they are.No. 4 UCLA at No. 25 Nebraska -- 7 p.m. on BTNUCLA has one of the most impressive resumes in the nation, but coach Cori Close wants to see her team stay locked in all 40 minutes and play with urgency. A road game against a ranked Nebraska team could be another good challenge.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Arizona State quarterback transfer Sam Leavitt has already visited LSU and Tennessee this portal cycle and is planning to hear Miami's sales pitch very soon, CBS Sports' Chris Hummer reports. The Hurricanes, coming off Thursday night's College Football Playoff semifinal victory, are expected to host Leavitt after his visit with the Vols is complete.Miami's in the market for a top-end quarterback with Carson Beck prepping for his final start at the program on Jan. 19 in the national championship game ahead of the 2026 NFL Draft. One of the highest-paid transfers in the 2025 class, Beck starred several years at Georgia before signing with the Hurricanes in the offseason.Through 15 starts at Miami, Beck has thrown for 3,581 yards and 29 touchdowns with 11 interceptions. His second touchdown run of the season in the Fiesta Bowl with 18 seconds left pushed the Hurricanes to a 31-27 win over Ole Miss.\n        \n            \n                Where Miami's thrilling 2026 Fiesta Bowl win over Ole Miss ranks among all-time greatest CFP games\n                \n                    Will Backus                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLeavitt is the top-ranked player in the portal, per 247Sports. He threw for 1,628 yards with 10 touchdowns, three interceptions and five scores on the ground in limited duty before a season-ending injury in October. In addition to LSU and Tennessee, Leavitt has also visited  Kentucky and Texas Tech as musical chairs at the quarterback position continues.\nCould Alabama's Ty Simpson be a wild card? Multiple sources close to Miami's program told CBS Sports on Friday that while Leavitt is the primary target for the Hurricanes, there's a chance other signal callers enter the picture, including Alabama's Ty Simpson, who recently declared for the NFL Draft. Jan. 14 is the deadline for Simpson to keep his name in the draft or withdraw to play another season of college football.The transfer portal's entry deadline is two days after that, making it feasible that Simpson could enter if he chooses not to turn pro. Simpson led the Crimson Tide to the playoff in his only season as Alabama's starter, finishing with 3,567 yards passing, 28 touchdowns and five interceptions.During the 2024 transfer cycle, future No. 1 overall pick Cam Ward — then at Washington State — declared for the draft before briefly entering the portal and ultimately landing at Miami. Beck did the same following Georgia's Sugar Bowl loss to Notre Dame last December prior to signing with the Hurricanes over an offer to stay with the Bulldogs.\nBoth Leavitt and Simpson would be considered \"ideal fits\" in Shannon Dawson's offensive scheme for the Hurricanes, one source put it. Simpson is more of the pocket passer while Leavitt has shown success on the ground, similar to Beck at times this season in third-down situations.Leavitt is a former Michigan State transfer and was the 2024 Big 12 Offensive Freshman of the Year for the playoff-bound Sun Devils under coach Kenny Dillingham. Arizona State recently filled the void left at QB1 by Leavitt's departure with Kentucky's Cutter Boley.\"High-end\" quarterbacks in the portal this cycle are expected to fetch over the $3.5 million threshold for the 2026 campaign. Washington's Demond Williams is returning to the Huskies on a deal around $4 million after previously saying he was planning to enter the transfer portal days after signing a new contract.\nNew Texas Tech quarterback Brendan Sorsby signed with the Red Raiders for $5 million, despite interest from other programs, including Lane Kiffin and LSU, who failed in their bid to get him.\n    \n                                        \n    InsideTheU is your source for intel and analysis on the Miami Hurricanes.

    "description": "\n        Giannis Antetokounmpo gave The Athletic's Sam Amick an 11-minute interview on Wednesday night. The entire interview was illuminating and well",
    "body": "\n        Giannis Antetokounmpo gave The Athletic's Sam Amick an 11-minute interview on Wednesday night. The entire interview was illuminating and well worth a read, but as so often happens when a superstar grants any sort of exclusive, the social media aggregation machine honed in on only a single, newsy quote. Antetokounmpo has been the subject of trade rumors since last spring. Those rumors have become the dominant story of the 2025-26 season. The Bucks are 16-21 as of this writing, have limited control over their future draft capital and have $20 million or so in dead Damian Lillard money squatting on their books for the next four seasons. In other words, their outlook is grim, but by all accounts, they would not entertain the notion of trading Antetokounmpo unless he asked for it. This makes Antetokounmpo's declaration to Amick that he would not request a trade seemingly quite significant.\"There will never be a chance, and there will never be a moment that I will come out and say, 'I want a trade,' \" Antetokounmpo said. \"That's not … in … my … nature. OK?\"Predictably, this quote has made the rounds. Bucks fans are understandably thrilled to hear this sort of talk out of their franchise player. But within the same interview, Antetokounmpo suggested that while this is his stance right now, it may not be forever. \n\"Until today, my wife is great. She's a great mother. She's a great partner. She supports me. Until today. Tomorrow, she might wake up and be like, 'I don't want this. I fell out of love,' he said. \"Until today, me and (Bucks general manager) Jon (Horst) have a good relationship. Tomorrow, (Horst) might think there's something else out there, and he might have to do whatever he has to do.\"When Amick asked if he planned to spend the rest of his career in Milwaukee, Antetokounmpo said yes, unless a time comes in which the Bucks don't want him anymore. When Amick suggested he wielded the power in the situation, Antetokounmpo responded, \"I'm not the one in charge. I am an employee.\" He has taken this tone quite a bit amid these rumors. During December's rumor flare up, Antetokounmpo essentially argued that he could not be held responsible for what his representatives do. \"If my agent is talking to the Bucks about it, he's his own person,\" he said. After owner Wes Edens mentioned a productive meeting between him and Antetokounmpo in June, Antetokounmpo responded at Bucks media day \"I cannot recall that meeting.\"All of this together paints a picture of Antetokounmpo trying to distance himself from these backroom dealings. Maybe these conversations are happening behind the scenes. He wants it known that he's not a part of them and that he does not want to be a part of them. But until Antetokounmpo puts pen to paper on the contract extension that he is eligible to sign this offseason, nobody outside of Milwaukee is going to believe that he is committed to the Bucks for life. For now, these quotes amount to little more than semantic games. Even if he's not directly participating in them, these conversations are happening. He has said in the past that winning a second championship is more important to him than retiring as a Buck. It's all talk until he has to make a binding, contractual decision.\nAmick asked a direct and important question. Antetokounmpo gave an answer that made for an easy quote. The news cycle ran with it, and in the process, largely missed what was ultimately the most interesting part of the interview. The final question Amick asked was quick and to the point: can the Bucks figure it out? Normally, this is the sort of question that yields a quick soundbite, almost alway in the affirmative with perhaps a single minor adjustment or improvement that needs to be made. But instead, Antetokounmpo gave a deep, thoughtful answer about what he believes a winning team needs in the NBA. After the first paragraph of his transcription, Amick notes that Antetokunmpo, \"with his passion rising as he speaks over the loud beeping sounds of a nearby forklift, starts clapping his hands together.\" After the third paragraph, Amick notes that a Bucks staffer essentially tells Antetokounpo to hurry up, but the star shouts \"one second\" so he can finish his thought. The answer, essentially, is a guide from a one of the greatest players in NBA history to the rest of his team about what he thinks they need to do in order to save to this season. In short: Antetokounmpo wants sacrifice. Here is the full, lengthy quote.\"You cannot win on your own terms, right? Do you think when I won the championship (in 2021), that I didn't want to have the ball down the stretch and make all the shots that (former Bucks guard) Khris (Middleton) was making? I wanted that. But at the end of the day, winning cannot be on your terms. So I feel like sometimes on young teams, you have to win by you being pretty, by you being the ball-dominant player, by you feeling good and making the plays. No, you have to be selfless. You have to be selfless. I've seen this over and over again.I have seen it over and over. There's some people that you have to play through them to win the championship. And there's some teams like, say, two years ago when Boston won. Was Jrue Holiday his 100% self? No, he played a role. He was part of a system. Al Horford. Derrick White. (Payton) Pritchard. (Jayson) Tatum and Jaylen Brown were able to thrive. Winning doesn't always look the same. It's either you're a winner, or you're not a winner. I want to win. I want to win. And the thing about this team is that as long as we figure out, 'How can we be selfless and give things away?' It's buying into winning -- really winning -- and then we are going to figure it out. And if we don't buy in, we don't come together.I've been a part of winning teams, and winning teams don't always win championships, right? Indiana was a winning team but didn't wind up with the championship. So I've seen some teams, and some players, who are buying in -- like (Kyle) Kuzma. Kuzma won a championship (with the Lakers in 2020), then went to Washington and played a lot of years. He's a vet. But he's the most bought-in player, right? He's coming off the bench making $25 million ($22.4 million this season, in fact). He could be like, 'Guys, I'm the third option. I'm second option. Give me the ball.' But he is buying in. He's coming off of the bench. Then he starts. Comes off the bench. Gets touches. Doesn't get touches. That's what winning looks like, you know?But to answer your question, I think we have to buy in more. Winning won't always look the way we want it to look. Maybe one day I have to have 20 rebounds, eight assists, 12 points. But then maybe another night (he) has to do more things. But winning doesn't always look the same.\"There is a rare honesty in this answer that says something bigger about the psyche of just about every successful NBA player. Remember, Antetokounmpo won Finals MVP in 2021. He scored 50 points in the closeout game of the series. And he's still thinking about all of the shots Middleton took instead of him. Some version of this thought process is probably playing out in the mind of almost every player in the NBA. After all, for most of their pre-NBA careers, most NBA players had only ever been stars. That's how they got to the NBA in the first place. They were the best player on their AAU team. And their high school team. And their college team.But the things that get you to the NBA and the things that keep you in the NBA aren't always the same. In this league, everyone is a star, and when everyone is a star, standing out often means doing the grunt work that stars aren't eager to do. Even at the absolute highest levels, even when you're as good as Giannis Antetokounmpo, you have to make sacrifices for the greater good of the team. You have to pass up shots that you want. You have to do dirty work. Like those older, accomplished Celtics veterans did, you have to be a part of a team.The fact that Antetokounmpo would go this far out of his way to spell out his belief on this matter when asked if the Bucks can turn their season around suggests that, at least so far, he doesn't believe his team is doing those things. And, well, there's a fair bit of evidence to support that notion.As the Bucks have attempted to load up around Antetokounmpo, they've been linked to several big-name scorers on the trade market. But look at their statistical profile. They have the second-highest effective field goal percentage in the NBA. On a per-play basis, they have one of the best half-court offenses in the NBA, and when Antetokounmpo is on the floor, they score at will. Yet the Bucks are only 13-10 with Antetokounmpo available this season, and that's having played the NBA's fourth-easiest schedule to date. So what's going wrong?In short, it's everything except the scoring. The Bucks rank 28th in rebounding rate. Now, Doc Rivers teams never get offensive rebounds, but even with Antetokounmpo, they rank just 16th in defensive rebounding. They rank 18th in defense. They foul far more often than they get fouled. They're in the middle of the pack when it comes to passing volume, and while some of that is inherent to building around Antetokounmpo's specific skills, their passing numbers actually went down during his recent eight-game absence.\nIn a way, these can be read almost as marching orders. The Bucks need to get players who can do the dirty work. Who can be selfless in the ways that Antetokounmpo described. They seemingly don't have enough players to do that right now. Interestingly, Kuzma, the one player Antetokounmpo calls out be name here as someone who is doing so, almost has to be in any big trade the Bucks make for salary purposes.Nobody really knows how much longer Antetokounmpo will play for the Bucks. Not even him, given all of that talk about how different things might be tomorrow. But for now, Antetokounmpo is laying out a sort of blueprint for what he wants the Bucks, or any team he plays for, to be. And so long as he remains a Buck, Milwaukee has the power to at least try to build that sort of team. They may not be able to control his desires, but they can control what they put around him. Unlike any of the quotes about his future, this one is actionable, and from that perspective, it is probably the most substantive thing he's said all season.\n            ",

Our records carry over to the postseason, which means it's not really a new season like they say in the NFL locker rooms right now. Week 18 is always a challenge, but I went 9-7 last week both against the spread and straight up. That takes my season spread record to 140-129-3 and the straight-up record goes to 176-95-1.Landing 11 games over .500 against the spread is a nice way to close the regular season, but I expect to be even better in the playoffs.

Matthew Stafford threw three picks in that game. That won't happen again. Look for a much better offensive effort from the Rams. The Panthers ran it well against the Rams in the last meeting, so that will again be the focus here. Bryce Young also made some key throws in that game. But this is a big challenge for a young Panthers team. The Rams are playoff tested and Stafford and gang will play like it.

Both teams come limping in here as the Packers have lost four in a row and the Bears have lost two straight. The Bears have defensive issues that have shown up lately that Jordan Love, who will be back, can exploit. The Packers will go after Caleb Williams like they did in the two other meetings. That could lead to a lot of big plays and a lot of points for both teams -- if the weather isn't a disaster. In the end, the Packers and Love will get the best of it.Pick: Packers 27, Bears 24Buffalo Bills at Jacksonville Jaguars (+1.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThis young Jaguars team is one of the bigger surprises in the league, but they do a lot of things well. They finished as the top run defense and no back ran for over 75 yards against them during the season. That will be big against James Cook, who led the league in rushing. If they can stop Cook, that will put a lot on Josh Allen, who is more than capable. On the other side, the Bills have had defensive issues, while the Jaguars have played well on offense with Trevor Lawrence. Look for that to continue. This will be fun to watch as both quarterbacks light it up with Lawrence winning it late.Pick: Jaguars 32, Bills 28San Francisco 49ers at Philadelphia Eagles (-5.5)Sunday, 4:30 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Eagles come in with a dominating defense, while the 49ers have a good offense. That's the matchup that will decide the game. The 49ers defense has struggled all year, while the Eagles offense has as well. Something has to give. I think the Eagles offense will get it going some here against the 49ers defense. Look for a big game from Saquon Barkley. On the other side, I look for the Eagles to limit Brock Purdy and the 49ers offense. The Eagles get it going some on offense and advance to the next round.Pick: Eagles 27, 49ers 17Los Angeles Chargers (+3.5) at New England PatriotsSunday, 8 p.m. ET on NBC\nThis is a long trip for the Chargers. It's also a big game for quarterback Justin Herbert, who has yet to win a playoff game. The problem is the offensive line in front of him has issues. The Patriots defense should be able to limit the Chargers' run game and pressure Herbert. On the other side, the Chargers have a top 10 defense and that could challenge Drake Maye. The Patriots have averaged 168.6 rushing yards per game and 5.8 yards per carry over the last five games, so look for them to run it early and often. If Herbert isn't protected on the other side, it could be a long night for the Chargers. But this is Maye's first playoff game and the Chargers defense is good against the pass. It's close, but the Pats win it late.   Pick: Patriots 24, Chargers 23Houston Texans at Pittsburgh Steelers (+3)Monday, 8:15 p.m. ET on ESPN/ABC (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Texans have one of the best defenses in the league and that can be a problem for a Steelers offense that is just OK. Aaron Rodgers does have a lot of playoff experience, which matters. He also gets back DK Metcalf in this one, which is big. The Steelers offensive line has also been good as of late. The Texans offense has been better during a nine-game winning streak, but this will come down to Houston's offensive line against the Steelers' front. That's a problem. Look for the Steelers to force some mistakes by C.J. Stroud as Pittsburgh advances behind its defensive front in a playoff upset.Pick: Steelers 23, Texans 20\n            ",

In 15 games, he has completed 73% of his passes for 3,349 yards and 41 touchdowns with just six interceptions. He also has rushed 83 times for 284 yards and six scores. In the national semifinal win over the Oregon Ducks, he completed 17 of 20 passes for 177 yards and five touchdowns. Mendoza's elite accuracy makes Indiana's offense extremely tough to stop, but the Hoosiers are also incredibly strong on defense. Indiana finished the regular season ranked fourth nationally in total defense. Indiana has been just has stingy in the postseason, holding Ohio State, Alabama and Oregon to an average of just 11.6 points per game.  See which team to back at SportsLine.\nWhy Miami can cover Senior quarterback Carson Beck helps guide the Hurricanes. In 15 games, he has completed 73.3% of his passes for 3,581 yards and 29 touchdowns with 11 interceptions. He has also rushed for a pair of touchdowns. In the national semifinal win over Ole Miss, he completed 23 of 37 passes for 268 yards and two touchdowns with one interception. The Miami ground attack is led by junior running back Mark Fletcher Jr. In 13 games this season, he has carried 199 times for 1,080 yards (5.4 average) and 10 touchdowns. Miami's defensive front could be an x-factor in this matchup. Defensive end Rueben Bain Jr. has been borderline unblockable at times as the likely top-10 pick in the 2026 NFL Draft has piled up four sacks in the CFP. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Indiana vs. Miami picksSportsLine's model is going Over on the total, projecting 48 combined points.

    "body": "\n        At the onset of the year, I made a list of goals I want to accomplish in my own personal golf game. They have your run-of-the-mill hits, of course, like playing more rounds, making a hole-in-one and going on a buddies trip, but there are two actions items that have been seared into my brain the last few weeks because the way in which they run, counterintuitive to each other.You see, I want to lower my handicap to the lowest figure of my life. I want to play smarter golf. I want to shoot scores in the 60s and feel the rush of stringing together birdie after birdie. I want that plus sign next to my name again. But, the thing is, I still want to be able to hit shots while I accomplish this. I want to shape them. I want to flight them. I want to use the conditions to carve them. I want to play Golf with a capital G, even if this tightrope act may ultimately be one which results in a faceplant. It's just more fun that way, score be damned.You may read this and think, \"Well, yeah, you have to hit shots in order to play golf,\" but actually, I don't think you do. At least not the type of golf you have in mind. I'm talking about the type of golf that was on display at Waialae Country Club this past weekend at the Sony Open. \nMeasuring around 7,000 yards and playing to a par 70, the Seth Raynor design should be obsolete by now. The game should have passed it by, but yet it remains and is still one of players' favorites for what it requires out of them. It's not distance that they need but rather skill -- the ability to hit different shots out of different windows at different times while considering a whole myriad of factors.Now, that is timeless.\n        \n            \n                Chris Gotterup runs pulls away from field to win 2026 Sony Open, first tournament of PGA Tour season\n                \n                    Patrick McDonald                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhen trying to compare eras in different sports, a common refrain among those who side with recent or active players is that these guys become more athletic through general evolution, right? Technology has improved. Equipment and training aids have become more helpful. Data is being implemented in ways to drive decisions like never before. Players' eating habits are way better. They rarely consume alcohol and stick to the same meals that they know fuel them in the most effective manner. Workouts are getting more out of them, while recovery methods like cold plunges and red light therapy restore muscles and alleviate aches and pains in a blink of an eye.\nWhile not basketball or football players, golfers fall in this same boat. Equipment is a far cry from what it was at the start of the century as big mis-hits continue to be a thing of the past. Driving ranges are littered with Trackman and Foresight launch monitors as some players are beholden to their numbers like toddlers with a tablet in front of them.On the golf course, players and caddies know where to press their luck and can quantify how much more advantageous it may be to take, say, driver off the tee on a certain hole as opposed to laying back and playing for position.As such, many believe golfers have gotten better. I'm not here to say they haven't -- I mean, have you seen what Scottie Scheffler has done the last four years? Have you seen Rory McIlroy when he is firing on all cylinders? -- but I don't think all of them have. I think the bulk have just become more efficient.\nThey have gotten better at identifying the path of least resistance, taking it and attempting to put as few strokes as possible on their scorecard. That's the name of the game, after all, isn't it?This weekend in golf got me thinking about this. Over in Dubai, blustery conditions wreaked havoc on players in the second round to the point that 2019 Open champion Shane Lowry took to social media and expressed how much fun he had in them. He signed for a 3-under 68 and beat the field average by nearly six strokes.\"It was refreshing playing in those conditions today,\" Lowry wrote. \"Fun needing to shape shots and hitting 8 irons 130 yards.\"\nOn the other side of the the planet, something similar unfolded at the Sony Open. In what some believe to be the last trip the PGA Tour takes to Hawaii due to future scheduling changes, Waialae Country Club enjoyed one last hoorah. From Thursday afternoon through Saturday, players were forced to play golf with a capital G. If you weren't about it, you were on your flight back to the mainland on Friday.Nearly everything had to be accounted for on every shot -- varying wind directions depending on which way the hole ran, shot shapes and run outs and how they affected the total yardage, where the correct miss was. Golf may be played in an arena during the early portion of the week, but when it actually matters and real stakes are on the line, it is best that it remains an outdoor sport.\"On a driving range you're not normally hitting a lot of those shots,\" Jordan Spieth said. \"You're not hitting 5-iron from 160 and trying to like chip it. You just get a really good gauge on where things are at, and when you're doing it well it's really fun.\"\nIn a perfect world, this would be the case every week. Golfers required to play golf, required to do more than see the target, know the number and swing away. The juggling act in between the ears of deciding which variables to weigh and which to ignore is an integral part of the game. It's where the elite separate themselves even more.Instead, there are only a handful of instances each year in which the confluence of variables set the table in such a way. It's part golf course, part time of year and part luck. For the 2026 season, it happened to be served in the first week, and although the PGA Tour may be leaving Hawaii in the future, I hope the tournament was enough to remind them it doesn't need to leave the golf behind, too.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Detroit Lions intend to hire Drew Petzing to be their next offensive coordinator, sources tell Jonathan Jones of CBS Sports. Petzing spent the last three seasons in that role with the Arizona Cardinals, producing mixed results for their offense.Petzing, 38, has been coaching since he worked as a graduate assistant at Boston College from 2010-11. He's been in the NFL since he was hired by the Cleveland Browns to be a football operations intern in 2013.Following stints as an offensive assistant with the Minnesota Vikings and Cleveland Browns, Jonathan Gannon hired Petzing to be his offensive coordinator in 2023. In Petzing's first season with the team, Arizona averaged just 19.4 points per game, but that improved to 23.5 points per game in 2024. That was good for 12th in the NFL.This past season, the Cardinals' offense was plagued by injuries to key players like Kyler Murray, James Conner and Marvin Harrison Jr. As a result, Arizona ranked 23rd in the NFL at 20.9 points per game. The Cardinals' rushing attack ranked 31st in the NFL with just 93.1 yards per game, although the passing attack was far more potent at 232.6 yards per game, which was good enough for seventh overall.\nThose numbers may not inspire much confidence in Petzing as a playcaller, but he will have far more talent with which to work in Detroit. Between Jared Goff, Jahmyr Gibbs, Amon-Ra St. Brown, Jameson Williams and Sam LaPorta, the Lions are loaded at the offensive skill positions. Besides, this was a team that averaged 28.3 points in what was considered to be a down year.That talent didn't always click under former offensive coordinator John Morton, who was fired after just one year on the job. Following a relatively slow start for the Detroit offense, coach Dan Campbell took over playcalling duties in Week 10 and never relinquished them.\"It was just, let's try something a little different,\" Campbell said about the move in November. \"Look, I know what I want to do, I know how I want to do it. Now, that being said, this is a collaborative effort. I was taking input from John Morton that whole time, and the other coaches.\"\nPetzing will be tasked with pushing the Lions offense closer to the heights of the Ben Johnson era from 2022-24. If he can do that, Detroit should be poised for a bounce back campaign after missing out on the current postseason.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Ten starter for the 2026 NBA All-Star Game, which will take place on Feb. 15 at the Intuit Dome in Los Angeles, were announced on Monday. This year's All-Star Game starters were headlined by multiple familiar faces, including Lakers guard Luka Dončić and Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo.Dončić will be making his first appearance in the All-Star game as a member of the Lakers after being traded from the Dallas Mavericks last year. The Lakers star received the most fan votes and will be appearing in sixth All-Star game. The rest of the West starters are listed below. A fan vote broke the tie between Victor Wembanyama and Timberwolves star Anthony Edwards for the final spot.NBA All-Star Game starters -- Western Conference Luka Dončić, Lakers (sixth selection)Stephen Curry, Warriors (12th)Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Thunder (fourth)Nikola Jokić, Nuggets (eighth)Victor Wembanyama, Spurs (second)Antetokounmpo led the East in fan voting and will be playing in his 10th All-Star game. Here are the rest of the East selections:NBA All-Star Game starters -- Eastern Conference Tyrese Maxey, 76ers (second selection)Jalen Brunson, Knicks (third)Cade Cunningham, Pistons (second)Jaylen Brown, Celtics (fifth)Giannis Antetokounmpo, Bucks (10th)And here are the results of the fan, player and media voting to determine starters in both conferences:\nThe format of this year's All-Star game will look drastically different. That's because the league is implementing a new format with two U.S. teams and one international team competing in a round-robin tournament of 12-minute games.\nThe 2026 NBA All-Star Game has a new USA vs. The World format, but the ASG selection process remains the same. That means there will be 12 initial All-Stars picked per conference, including the 10 players revealed Monday. Each conference will also get seven reserves. The All-Star reserves are set to be named next week, per NBC Sports.If there are not at least 16 American players or eight international players through the initial All-Star roster-building process, commissioner Adam Silver would then add additional All-Stars to fill out the rosters. The All-Star Game, taking place on Sunday, Feb. 15, will feature two American teams and one World team, all of which will have at least eight players.With the new format, we know who should be representing the starters for \"The World\" team: Dončić, Gilgeous-Alexander, Jokić, Wembanyama and Antetokounmpo. The USA starters will be determined later.\nAnother new wrinkle for the voting this year is that players are no longer being selected via backcourt and frontcourt designations.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Chicago Bears coach Ben Johnson rolled the dice often this season en route to an NFC North title and nearly eight quarters of playoff football, trusting Caleb Williams and a talented offense to convert in critical situations -- until the waning seconds of regulation on Sunday night's classic following an epic touchdown toss to Cole Kmet.Johnson said he considered a two-point conversion try with 18 seconds to play rather than tie the game with a PAT and play for overtime, but had strong reasoning for his decision prior to Chicago's 20-17 loss to the Los Angeles Rams.\"Thought about it,\" Johnson said. \"Probably what played a little bit of a factor was our goal-to-go situations hadn't gone very clean. Our inside the five-[yard line] plan hadn't worked out quite like we had hoped. I just felt better about taking our chances there in overtime.\"The Bears converted 57% of their two-point conversion attempts this season, which was above the league average per Stats Muse, and converted a NFL-leading 15 times on fourth downs en route to a playoff berth. Johnson has a handful of trick plays his team executed well this fall, but when it was time to potentially offer another one up to get to the NFC Championship, the offensive guru declined.Johnson trusted Chicago's defense, a unit that came up with a three-and-out stop on the Rams' first possession prior to Williams' interception in the extra session. The Bears turned it over three times on mistakes from their franchise quarterback and were stuffed on a fourth-and-goal attempt with 3:06 remaining in the fourth quarter on Williams' incompletion to Luther Burden.\nIt was that errant throw and run-game malfunctions near the goal line that made Johnson hesitate to gamble on a two-point conversion try rather than go with the confident approach he's shown as Chicago's play-caller in his first season.\"It's tough. In these moments you feel that you let your team down,\" Williams said his interception in overtime led to the Rams' game-winning field goal several players later. \"It's a good lesson learned for us, first time being in this situation for me and for us as a team. I'm excited for what's to come, but obviously going to go back and watch this and figure out how I can be better.\"Williams finished with 257 yards and two touchdowns, including the 14-yard heave in the back of the end zone to Kmet on a pass that traveled 51 yards in the air and sent Soldier Field into a frenzy.\n\"They all believed, man,\" Johnson said. \"They all believed that we could find a way to win each and every week. And so it's disappointing like that. I'm proud of the group. It's a special group.\"\n            ",

But it should be noted that since Dec. 1 Kelvin Sampson's program is 10-0 and rating as the best team in the country, according to BartTorvik.com. That suggests Houston is trending in the right direction, per usual.\"We're just doing what we do every year,\" said Houston coach Kelvin Sampson. \"We just get better.\"Which is scary for the rest of the Big 12.\n        \n            \n                College basketball's three undefeated teams win Saturday, but we predict two more fall before January ends\n                \n                    Kyle Boone                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nYes, Arizona is No. 1 in the Top 25 And 1 for the ninth consecutive day -- but, as I said on Inside College Basketball earlier this month, if I had to pick a national champion right now, I'd go with Houston. The Cougars have an all-time great coach still operating at an elite level at the age of 70 years old, roster-continuity from year-to-year and multiple five-star freshmen who double as projected top-20 picks in the 2026 NBA Draft. In other words, Houston has good roster-balance and everything else a team typically needs to march through that 68-team bracket.\nLast season, they won five games in it. This season, my prediction is that they'll ultimately win six games in it, cut nets and solidify Sampson's place in the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame.

    "body": "\n        With 15.2 seconds remaining in the Houston Rockets' win over the New Orleans Pelicans on Sunday, the crowd inside the Toyota Center rose to its feet as Kevin Durant strode to the free-throw line. Durant received the ball from the ref, went through his normal routine and hit nothing but net on his first attempt. Free throws, even those that help seal a victory, don't usually deserve standing ovations, but with that make Durant passed Dirk Nowitzki to move into sixth place on the NBA's all-time scoring list. \nIronically, Durant had one of his worst game of the season against the Pelicans -- 18 points on 5-of-18 shooting -- but he did enough to move up another rung on the all-time scoring ladder. Durant now has 31,562 career points, and only needs 731 to pass Michael Jordan and move into the top five. PlayerCareer points1. LeBron James42,7272. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar38,3873. Karl Malone36,9284. Kobe Bryant33,6435. Michael Jordan32,2926. Kevin Durant31,562Sunday's poor shooting performance aside, Durant is putting together another incredible scoring season: 26.1 points per game on 51/39.3/88.7 shooting splits. At that pace, he'll need just 29 more games to pass Jordan. The Rockets have 42 games remaining in the season, and assuming Durant doesn't miss any significant time, he should move ahead of Jordan in mid- to late-March. Durant (again, assuming health) should have no trouble catching Bryant, who is 2,081 points ahead of him, at some point next season. It will be a number of years until the 37-year-old Durant has a chance to move into the top three, however. He needs 5,366 points to catch Malone, and may have to play into his 40s to do so. Whether he'll be willing or able to play that long remains to be seen. \"To be up there with Dirk, somebody I looked up to, I idolized, I competed against. We had some great battles. He always was supportive of my career and my game. So, you know to be up there with a legend like that, it's just insane. And be right under Michael Jordan, it's crazy man, Durant said. \"I want to continue to keep stacking, keep climbing up the charts, just see how I finish. It's been amazing so far.\"\nLet's take a closer look at how Durant is putting together yet another incredible season for the Rockets, who have won three of their last four to climb back into fifth place in the crowded Western Conference at 25-15. 'To be up there with a legend like that, it's just insane,' Durant said about passing Nowitzki. \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            KD is still incredibly efficientDurant's historic efficiency has long been his calling card. At 24 years old he became the joint-youngest player (along with Mark Price) to join the 50/40/90 club -- 50% shooting overall, 40% from 3-point range and 90% on free throws -- and is one of three players (along with Larry Bird and Steve Nash) to have multiple 50/40/90 seasons. His 29.1 points per game in 2023 are also the third-most by a player in a 50/40/90 season. Once again, Durant is within striking distance of a 50/40/90 season and has been one of the league's most efficient scorers. His 26.1 points per game rank 13th in the league. Of the top 15 scorers, only Nikola Jokić (60.5%) and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (54.7%) have a better field goal percentage than Durant, who has made 51% of his attempts. (Giannis Antetokounmpo has not played enough games to qualify for the official leaderboards, but he has also been more efficient than Durant.) Just look at his shot chart. The NBA's stat site breaks things down in 14 specific areas of the floor. Durant is only below the league average on right wing 3s. Kevin Durant's shot chart \n                                                                    NBA.com\n                                                            Tough shot-makingFew players make difficult shots look as easy as Durant, who, in his 18th season, is still among the league's best in this department. Durant is fourth in the league in mid-range attempts at 5.6 per game, and making 49.5% of them. Of the five players averaging at least five such attempts, only Gilgeous-Alexander (50.5%) has been more efficient. PlayerMid-range attemptsMid-range %Shai Gilgeous-Alexander550.5%Kevin Durant5.649.5%Brandon Ingram5.749%DeMar DeRozan6.547.8%Jaylen Brown5.944.8%Durant often acts as a safety valve for the Rockets' offense, which lacks a true point guard and spacing. As a result, he's tied for ninth in the league in late shot clock attempts (0-4 seconds remaining) per game at 1.9. Remarkably, he's shooting 50% on those attempts. No one else in the top-10 is shooting better than 44.3% (Jalen Brunson). \nFurthermore, the NBA has a new stat called expected field goal percentage, which uses a \"Shot Difficulty\" rating to measure the expected field goal percentage for the average NBA player on every shot. You can then compare a player's expected field goal percentage to their actual field goal percentage to get an idea of which players are best at making tough shots. To no surprise, Durant is right near the top. His expected field goal percentage is 43.9%, but he's shooting 51%. +7.1% differential ranks sixth in the league. PlayerxFG%FG%FG%+Nikola Jokić47.8%60.5%+12.7%Cam Spencer39.8%47.8%+8%Shai Gilgeous-Alexander47.3%54.7%+7.4%DeMar DeRozan43.6%50.8%+7.2%Steph Curry39.8%47%+7.2%Kevin Durant43.9%51%+7.1%However you want to slice it, Durant's shot-making has once again been incredible. \nAging with graceDurant was the No. 2 overall pick in the 2007 NBA Draft, and has spent nearly half of his life in the league. While most of his peers are out of the league or relegated to bit roles off the bench, Durant is likely going to make his 16th All-Star appearance, which would move him into fourth place on the all-time list, behind only LeBron James, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Kobe Bryant. Few players in NBA history have ever matched what Durant is doing at this stage of their career. No one has averaged more points in their 18th season. The only other players to average at least 26 points per game at 37 or older are James and Steph Curry. The only other players to average at least 18 shots per game and shoot 50% or better after turning 35 are James and Karl Malone. \n\"It means a great deal to be around the league for this long. I mean, it takes playing a thousand-plus games to be in this category, at least,\" Durant said Sunday. \"I'm grateful for all the people that have helped me play this many games -- coaches, friends, family that invested in my game. You know how it goes. Without them, without the village, I wouldn't be here. I don't do anything on my own. Never have, never will. It's great to kind of celebrate that with them.\"\n            ",

The Hoosiers are seeking their first title in program history, while Miami is looking to claim its first championship since 2001.Indiana's road to the title game began earlier this month with a blowout 38-3 win over Alabama in the CFP quarterfinal at the Rose Bowl. That win marked the Hoosiers' first bowl game win of any kind since 1991. Curt Cignetti's program followed up that performance with an even more dominant showing the following week with a 56-22 win over Big Ten foe Oregon in the Peach Bowl.Bet Indiana vs. Miami at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:Miami had to win three games away from South Florida to become the first team in the CFP era to play for the national title at its own stadium.

Miami coach Mario Cristobal could become the first coach in the AP poll era (since 1936) to win a national title as a player and the coach of his alma mater. Cristobal played at Miami (1989-92) as an offensive tackle.With a win, Miami can become the third two-loss national champion in FBS history. The Hurricanes would join LSU (2007) and Ohio State (2024). It would also mark the second consecutive season that the 12-team CFP format produced a two-loss champion. Ohio State lost to Oregon and Michigan before winning four games in a row en route to a title.Miami's path to the CFP title game was difficult with three games away from home, but now the Hurricanes will do something that no team in the BCS or CFP era has done: play for a title at their home stadium. Miami has played at Hard Rock Stadium since 2008 and lost the Orange Bowl in 2017 to Wisconsin.\nIndiana: The Hoosiers are in the midst of one of the most unlikely turnarounds in college football history. The Hoosiers could become the lowest-ranked team (No. 20) in the AP preseason poll to win the national championship since Auburn, who began the season at No. 22, did it in 2010.The Big Ten (Michigan and Ohio State) has won the last two national titles. If Indiana wins, it would be the first time since the 1940s that the conference has won three consecutive national titles. It would also become the third time (SEC twice) a conference had won three consecutive national titles with three different schools.Indiana star quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner Fernado Mendoza will be returning to South Florida for the national title game. Mendoza grew up near the Miami campus, and his father, Fernando Mendoza Sr., was teammates with Cristobal at Christopher Columbus High School in Miami.\nMiami vs. Indiana prediction, pickHaving watched Indiana up close at the Rose Bowl earlier this month, Cignetti's squad feels like a team of destiny. Indiana has everything you need to win a title. The Hoosiers are physical in the trenches on both sides of the football, have a star quarterback to pair with talented skill position players and are disciplined. This game is going to come down to who can control the line of scrimmage. I'll give the edge to Indiana, although Miami is very talented up front on both sides of the football. I don't think this will be a blowout, but Indiana wins by 10. Pick: Indiana -8.5\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Miami Dolphins have found their new lead man and are expected to hire Green Bay Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley to serve as their head coach, per CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz. Hafley was a popular name this cycle and ultimately landed in Miami.Hafley, who turns 47 in April, just wrapped up his second season as the Packers' defensive coordinator. His unit ranked No. 12 in total defense, allowing 311.8 yards per game, and No. 11 in scoring defense, allowing 21.2 points per game. The Packers were eliminated in the wild card round last week after blowing the largest lead (18 points) in postseason franchise history to rival Chicago Bears.Hafley is well-traveled and experienced. He last served as the head coach at Boston College for four seasons, going 22-26 before leaving for the Packers. Before his time at Boston College, he spent a season as Ohio State's co-defensive coordinator and defensive backs coach. The Buckeyes allowed 13.7 points per game and 259.7 yards per game that season, which ranked the fewest in the FBS. Hafley also coached defensive backs with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Cleveland Browns and San Francisco 49ers, as well as at the college level at Pittsburgh and Rutgers.Miami viewed Hafley as a favorite, as the Dolphins recently hired former Packers vice president of player personnel Jon-Eric Sullivan to serve as their new general manager. Now, Sullivan brings in a familiar face to turn the franchise around.\nMiami turns to Hafley to replace Mike McDaniel, who the Dolphins fired after he registered a 33-35 record over four seasons. McDaniel posted winning records in each of his first two seasons with the Dolphins but went 15-19 over the last two years. He failed to win a single playoff game and went 4-17 against teams with winning records during his tenure.The Dolphins haven't won a postseason game since 2000, the longest active playoff win drought in the NFL. There is plenty to be figured out in South Beach this offseason, as star wide receiver Tyreek Hill is expected to be released and the Dolphins could be in the market for a new quarterback as well. The Dolphins benched Tua Tagovailoa for rookie Quinn Ewers after Tagovailoa threw a career-high 15 interceptions in 14 games. He signed a four-year, $212.4 million extension in 2024 and carries a $56.4 million cap hit in 2026.Hafley a harbinger of a particular QB?Given Tagovailoa's contract, odds are he will be on Miami's roster in 2026. A post-June 1 release would result in a $67.4 million dead cap hit for the Dolphins in 2026, a $31.8 million dead cap hit in 2027, plus an $11 million salary cap increase in 2026. \nWhat the Dolphins could do is bring in \"competition\" to battle Tagovailoa -- similar to what the Indianapolis Colts did with Anthony Richardson last year by adding Daniel Jones. Interestingly enough, Hafley comes over from a team that currently has what may be the most intriguing quarterback on its roster this offseason.\nMalik Willis is set to be a free agent this offseason, and he has earned the right to at least battle for a starting job. After Jordan Love suffered a concussion in the Packers' Week 16 loss to the Bears, Willis stepped into the starting lineup the following week against the Baltimore Ravens. While Green Bay lost that game, 41-24, Willis' performance was remarkable.Malik Willis is set to be a free agent this offseason, and he's earned the right to at least battle for a starting job. After Jordan Love suffered a concussion in the Packers' Week 16 loss to the Bears, Willis was called upon to step into the starting lineup the following week against the Baltimore Ravens. While Green Bay did lose that game, 41-24, Willis' performance was remarkable. \nThe former third-round pick out of Liberty completed 18 of 21 passes for 288 yards and one touchdown and led the Packers in rushing with 60 yards and two more touchdowns. According to CBS Sports Research, Willis became the first quarterback ever to complete 85% of his passes while averaging 13 yards per attempt and rushing for 60 yards. His 13.7 yards per attempt were the most by a quarterback with 50 rushing yards in a game in the past 50 seasons.\n        \n            \n                Ranking the top 50 NFL free agents for 2026: Early look at the stars who could hit the market in March\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSince the Tennessee Titans traded him to the Packers in 2024, Willis has gone 2-1 as a starter in Green Bay while averaging 204 passing yards per game. He has thrown three touchdowns with zero interceptions in those starts and posted a 132.4 passer rating. After his performance against Baltimore, Packers coach Matt LaFleur even had to publicly \"pump the brakes\" on the Willis hype.With Willis looking for a new opportunity, and the former Packers vice president of player personnel taking over as the Dolphins' general manager -- who then brought over the former Packers defensive coordinator to serve as head coach -- the Dolphins suddenly become a team to watch as a potential Willis landing spot.\n            ",

Fortunately for them they have Declan Rice, who might just be the best all-round central midfielder on the planet.  -- James Benge      Man of the match: Lautaro Martinez, Inter: The Nerazzurri captain will be asked to deliver a great performance this Tuesday as the Argentinian striker has recently struggled, as has the team, against the big teams. After losing to Atletico Madrid and Liverpool in the last two games of the league phase, Inter are called to not lose against the best team around Europe right now. A challenging task.  -- Francesco PorzioPrediction: Inter 0, Arsenal 1 – A battle between the league leaders in Italy and England will offer plenty of intrigue, especially as both sides contend for a top eight finish in the league phase and hope to book a direct spot in the round of 16. This game, though, is still Arsenal's to lose and it feels as if Europe's most in-form team – and deepest squad – is unlikely to do so. The Gunners' defense is as organized as it gets and their years-long effort to stockpile attackers means they probably have the goods for a narrow win against Inter and maintain top spot in the table. --  Pardeep Cattry\nBest bet: Under 2.5 goals (-140): This is a match that could go either way as these are two contenders for the Champions League crown meeting, but they also both sport two of the best defenses in the world. Goals will be hard to come by when both teams combined have conceded one goal in Champions League play so far, and a draw helps both to secure a place in the top eight of the league phase. -- Chuck Booth       Real Madrid vs. MonacoPlayer to watch: Vinicius Junior, Real Madrid: After the chorus of boos that greeted Madrid at the weekend, Vinicius is one of several with a point to prove to the Santiago Bernabeu. If the sacking of Xabi Alonso is to be justified, it will have to be because one of the most dangerous attackers in the world performs far better under Alvaro Arbeloa. Tuesday would be a good time to start proving that can be the case. -- James Benge    Man of the match: Jude Bellingham, Real Madrid: All eyes will likely be on Vinicius after what happened in Madrid last Saturday, but there were a lot of whistles also when Bellingham was announced before the game. This is why I can expect a lot from him against AS Monaco.  -- Francesco PorzioPrediction: Real Madrid 2, Monaco 2 – It is hard to know what to expect from Real Madrid after a very chaotic week that included Xabi Alonso's ouster and a surprise exit in the Copa del Rey to second division side Albacete. The pressure to perform is as clear as ever and Alonso did get the group going before his exit, so goals may not be much of an issue on Tuesday in the Champions League. Visitors Monaco have a bit of a chaotic streak, though, goals and defensive lapses coming in almost equal measure for the Ligue 1 side in European play this season. It feels like a perfect set-up for a dramatic encounter in Spain against a fellow agent of chaos in Real Madrid, who do not exactly seem positioned for a strong finish to the season without Alonso. --  Pardeep Cattry\nBest bet: Kylian Mbappe to score 2+ goals (+190): If Real Madrid are going to get anything out of this match, it will rest on the shoulders of one person, and that's Kylian Mbappe. Pressure is on Vini Jr. after being booed at the Bernebau over the weekend, but he's been at his best when sticking to the wings and getting the ball to the Frenchman in the middle. Facing a Monaco side that can pressure Real Madrid's defense, it will be imporant to get their attacking balance right and leaning on Mbappe is the best bet for that. -- Chuck Booth     Champions League matches on WednesdayMatchup\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    James Benge\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Francesco Porzio\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Pardeep Cattry\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Chuck Booth\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Roger Gonzalez\n                            \n            Galatasaray vs. Atletico2-21-21-21-31-2Qarabag vs. Eintracht Frankfurt1-01-00-01-11-2Marseille vs. Liverpool1-33-22-11-11-1Slavia Prague vs. Barcelona0-20-51-40-31-3Bayern Munich vs. Union S-G4-05-14-05-05-0Juventus vs. Benfica1-00-01-01-12-0Newcastle vs. PSV2-01-11-00-12-0Atalanta vs. Athletic Club1-02-01-01-02-1Chelsea vs. Pafos3-04-02-02-13-0   Game of the day: Marseille vs. LiverpoolPlayer to watch: Florian Wirtz, Liverpool: It has seemed the case for a while now that the Champions League might be a better vehicle for year one Wirtz than the Premier League, where defenders are still that bit too burly and robust with Liverpool's No.7. Only Kylian Mbappe has created more chances than Wirtz in this season's competition and a clash with Marseille should afford plenty of breakaway opportunities for further mayhem to be induced. -- James Benge    Man of the match: Virgil van Dijk, Liverpool: Facing OM away will be a big challenge for Liverpool and Arne Slot's side and this is why a player like the Dutch defender will be crucial for the success of the English team. Roberto De Zerbi's teams are always difficult to face when it comes to their attacking skills but the experience of Van Dijk can decide games like this one. -- Francesco PorzioPrediction: Marseille 2, Liverpool 1 – Arne Slot's strong start with Liverpool feels like a very long time ago now, the team devolving into a dull side that seem to drag themselves through games and are rarely rewarded with the result in the process. They head to France on the back of four Premier League draws, going goalless in two of those encounters. It does not inspire optimism in their output against Marseille, who may just have it in them to pull off the upset. Wins over Paris Saint-Germain in Ligue 1 play and Newcastle United in the Champions League make them an intriguing watch and a potential spoiler for a Liverpool team in need of a win. --  Pardeep Cattry\nBest bet: Marseille to win (+270): The vibes couldn't be more off at Liverpool than where they are right now, and despite Florian Wirtz's improvement for the Reds as of late, it won't be enough to keep Roberto De Zerbi's attack at bay. This is a situation where if Marseille nets a goal early, this match could get ugly, and it's hard to trust that Liverpool can break out of their doldrums to net a needed result right now. -- Chuck Booth  Slavia Prague vs. BarcelonaPlayer to watch: Marcus Rashford, Barcelona: What a loan spell this has been for the England international. The weekend's goal against Real Sociedad might have been in vain but it was his eighth of the season to go with the same number of assists. Whether as a starter or off the bench, a trip to Prague could offer him a prime opportunity to add more of either, perhaps even both. -- James Benge    Man of the match: Lamine Yamal, Barcelona: It will be difficult for any team to face the Spanish winger this season but Lamine Yamal needs to deliver after the disappointing defeat at Real Sociedad over the weekend. This is why I'm expecting big things from him this week against Slavia Prague. So far he has scored two goals in five games in the league phase and from a player like him we can definitely demand more. -- Francesco PorzioPrediction: Slavia Prague 1, Barcelona 4 – Barcelona's Champions League campaign has not always gone according to plan but in Prague on Wednesday, they are likely to thrust themselves back into the conversation for a top eight finish. Hansi Flick's side leads with attack-minded principles so expect them to put several goals past Slavia Prague, who are amongst the worst teams in the league phase with 11 goals conceded in six games, but considering Barcelona's defensive track record, the hosts might have a consolation goal in them. --  Pardeep Cattry\nBest bet: Barcelona to score 2 or more goals in the first half (+192): With Raphinha set to return to the Barcelona side, we're back to old reliable. Barcelona may be away from home, but that doesn't mean that they won't be able to run up the score against a Slavia Prague side that just doesn't have the players to keep up. Even if Raphinha is rested, Lamine Yamal and Marcus Rashford will be plenty to deal with.  -- Chuck Booth  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        We've reached the halfway point of the 2025-26 NBA season, and, as it looks right now, we're in for one hell of a stretch run and postseason. The Thunder initially looked like they were going to run away from everyone and break Golden State's 73-win record in the process, but they've come back to earth. On the flip side, the Clippers looked like they were dead in the water but have resurfaced of late. The Feb. 5 trade deadline looms. With the latter point in mind, will anyone make a move that swings the proverbial needle? I don't see it at the top, unless Detroit gets a shooter like Michael Porter Jr. or Trey Murphy III. Oklahoma City is set. The same goes for Denver, Houston and San Antonio. I know what these teams are at this point. I don't care about what seed they end up getting. They're contenders. The teams that interest me are the ones that could go either way. And even among those teams there are, for me, varying degrees of intrigue. Before I get into detail on the five teams that really have my eye me in the second half, below are five on the lower end of my interest scale. 6. Boston Celtics: I have a pretty good idea of what they are. They've been the best story in the league so far along with the Suns, but while Phoenix could still fade in the West, Boston is going to be a playoff team at worst and probably a top-four seed. The intrigue is whether they've seen enough internally to commit to a buying position at the trade deadline, or whether they'll still look to cut their tax bill and maybe move off of Anfernee Simons. And of course, will Jayson Tatum come back? 7. Los Angeles Lakers: I don't think the Lakers are a threat unless they pull off something unforeseen at the deadline. But of course there is interest in what is potentially LeBron James' final season, and whenever Austin Reaves returns we'll all be watching to see if he and Luka Dončić and rediscover their dominance together. When Dončić and Reaves have shared the court this season without LeBron James, the Lakers have outscored opponents by 14.2 points per 100 possessions, per Cleaning the Glass, with what would rank as the best offense in the league. Add LeBron to the equation, and that number falls off a cliff to -7.4 with the fifth-worst offense. If that doesn't change in a major way, the Lakers don't interest me much. 8. Los Angeles Clippers: As noted at the top, the Clippers were a dumpster fire for first two months but have since turned it around and are now well within range of a play-in spot. This is a super talented team that is capable of playing its way in to the playoffs and giving someone a hell of a time in the first round, but not if Kawhi Leonard is hurt again. This is sort of a watch-out-the-corner-of-my-eye team. 9. Cleveland Cavaliers: This is basically the same team that won 64 games last year, and for all the trouble they've had this season they're still tied in the loss column for the No. 4 seed. But now Darius Garland is hobbling again. It just doesn't feel like Cleveland's year, but obviously they are worth monitoring with as high as the No. 2 seed still well within reach. 10. Toronto Raptors: I'm interested in this team if they get Ja Morant. Otherwise the Raptors are just a nice story.\n        \n            \n                2026 NBA All-Star Game rosters: 10 starters announced for new-look ASG\n                \n                    Cameron Salerno                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAnd with that, let's get to my five most interesting second-half teams. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Philadelphia 76ersTwo straight losses to the Cavs has dampened some of the vibes, but prior to that the Sixers had won six of eight. Entering play on Monday, they're tied with the No. 4 Raptors and one game back of the No. 3 Knicks in the loss column with the sixth-easiest remaining schedule, according to Tankathon.   \nI don't think anyone is catching Detroit, but from the 2-seed down it's wide open. If Joel Embiid can stay in the lineup on a consistent basis (yes, I realize this is a massive IF), why not the Sixers, who had pretty much been left for dead beneath the weight of Embiid and Paul George's contracts?  For starters, Embiid is dominating again. It's not just the numbers. It's the decisions he's again forcing defenses to make. Single cover him, he goes right to the basket on Anthony Davis. Double him when a smaller player has wound up in a mismatch and he skips it cross court, gets you into rotation, and it all flows from there.    \nRemember when Embiid first took the court this season and literally couldn't jump? We're a long way from that.    \nEmbiid has scored at least 20 points in his last 13 games. Dating back to his season-high of 39 against the Pacers on Dec. 12, he's averaging 28 and 8, and over that span, as they primary defender, he's forcing scorers to shoot 11.7% worse on shots inside of six feet than they normally would, per NBA.com tracking. That's better than Victor Wembanyama.    Embiid has settled into a smooth flow with Tyrese Maxey, who is officially the leader of the offense now. Paul George has embraced the fact that he isn't a go-to player anymore even though he's paid like one. The Sixers need him to focus on defense and complimentary offense.    To the former, his pick and rolls, drives and pull-up shots per game are all down, while spot-up shots are accounting for 22% of his offensive diet, the highest that mark has been since his second season in the league.    \nThis isn't to say the Sixers want him standing in the corner spacing the floor and/or don't need a player of his abilities to attack offensively (which he has done more of in recent weeks as he's noted his body feeling better), but it's not a consistent primary option, and, at least from the outside looking in, George appears to be increasingly settled and comfortable in that space.    As far as the defense, the Sixers are holding opponents to 111.1 points per 100 possessions with George on the floor, per Cleaning the Glass. When he goes off, that number goes to 116.5. That's the difference in the third-best defense in the league and the 17th.    There's a reason everyone was so excited about this Maxey-Embiid-George Big 3 in Philly. They're all different sizes, different players, filling different roles. This isn't a Luka-LeBron-Austin Reaves situation where they all do the same thing. And now that they're all figuring out how to play their roles while also functioning in service of each other, it's not impossible to imagine this team becoming a serious factor down the stretch and into the playoffs if everyone somehow manages to stay healthy.    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. New York KnicksThe Knicks have lost eight of 10. Since winning the NBA Cup, they've gone 7-10 with the 28th-ranked defense. For the season, 60% of their wins have come against below-.500 teams. They've only won eight road games, the fewest of any East team currently among the top seven seeds.    Sure, Jalen Brunson being out for the last two losses against Phoenix and Golden State is an excuse if you want it, but the Knicks had lost five of previous last seven with Brunson playing. One reason why? Karl-Anthony Towns is having a dreadful shooting season.   KAT'S SHOOTINGRIM \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tMID-RANGE \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t3-POINT \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tPERCENTAGE \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t 60% \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t37% \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t35% \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tPERCENTILE \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t16th \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t29th \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t52nd \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tThe first two numbers are career lows, as is Towns' 52.3 eFG%. You have to go back to his rookie season to find a 3-point number lower than 35. And Towns isn't alone in his shooting woes of late. Mikal Bridges, who hovered around 43% on his 3s through the first three months, has fallen to 35.6% in January. Across December and January, OG Anunoby has been ice cold from deep.  Brunson can perhaps cover for some poor shooting in the regular season. The Knicks have still been a top-10 offense through this rough patch. But Towns and the wings have to be clicking if they're going to be true contenders.   Here's the good news: When Josh Hart plays, the Knicks tend to win. Miles McBride is having a sensational year. Mitchell Robinson can swing a series with his rebounding. Throughout NBA history, 18 teams have endured a 2-8 stretch and still managed to make the Finals. Six of those teams have won it all. The 2022 Warriors did it. So did the 2011 Mavericks and the 2004 Pistons. A stretch like this is not a death knell.   But it has to clean up over the second half, and given the expectations with which the Knicks entered this season, this is one of the big storylines to watch as we see what, if anything, they do at the trade deadline and make their way into March and April.   \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Minnesota Timberwolves  Why aren't more people talking about the Timberwolves? Whenever Western Conference contenders come up, it's OKC and Denver at the top, the Spurs have arrived, the Rockets aren't far behind, the Warriors need this, the Lakers need that, the Suns are the darling overachiever. Meanwhile, it's the Timberwolves who have been in the last two conference finals and are currently one of just four teams who rank in the top 10 of both offensive and defensive rating.   Entering play on Monday, Minnesota is percentage points ahead of the Rockets for the No. 4 seed. Rudy Gobert is pushing for his fifth Defensive Player of the Year. Jaden McDaniels will surely join him on an All-Defense team barring a long injury. Julius Randle is one of six players averaging at least 22 points, seven rebounds and five assists per game. Naz Reid leads the league in total bench points.   Oh by the way, they also have that Anthony Edwards guy.   Edwards is playing MVP basketball. The guy is averaging a tick under 30 PPG on 50/42 shooting splits. He had 55 against the Spurs on Saturday. He's shooting 49% from 3 on nine attempts per game since the turn of the calendar.   Every year Edwards has added something to his game. He went from an inefficient shooter to leading the league with 320 made 3-pointers last year at almost a 40% clip. This year he's at 41.8% from deep with a top-shelf (and by far career-high) 63.1 TS%. \nHe's made huge strides as a playmaker; if you double him now, he understands the power of getting off the ball and letting someone else tally both the bucket and the assist. The one frontier Edwards had left to conquer was clutch time consistency, and this season he's doing that and more. Entering play on Monday, Edwards is shooting a remarkable 71.7% overall, including 61% from 3, in the \"clutch\" -- which is defined as any possession inside the final five minutes when the score is within five points. Nobody else who has taken at least 15 clutch shots is even close to those marks, and they are a huge jump from Ant's 37.5/29.9 combined clutch shooting splits over the previous three seasons. CLUTCH ANTTS%EFG%NET RATINGTOTAL +/-2024-25 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t58.0 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t51.7 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t-9.9 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t-51 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t2025-26 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t84.8 \t\t\t\t83.7 \t\t\t\t+7.5 \t\t\t\t+21 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tThis started on opening night. The Wolves, who are 11-7 in clutch games so far after going 20-25 last year, were trailing Portland with just over a minute to play when Ant dropped Jerami Grant on a step-back 3.  \nOn Christmas, the Wolves trailed the Nuggets by 15 halfway through the fourth quarter only for Edwards to score 11 points over the final five minutes including this fadeaway corner 3 to send the game to overtime.  How about down two with inside a minute to play against the defending champs? \nThese are the types of shots that Inpredictable tracks as part of its Clutch Win Probability Added metric -- in which Edwards ranks fourth league-wide when factoring in all box-score stats and No. 1 overall based solely on made and missed field goals. By Inpredictable's count, Edwards has attempted 51 shots so far this year that have had an \"elevated impact on win probability,\" and on those shots he has posted a truly staggering 81.4 eFG%. All told, Minnesota's starting five of Edwards, Donte DiVincenzo, McDaniels, Randle and Gobert has the best point differential (+83) of any lineup on any team in the league. Do they need a true point guard to actually win the title? Maybe. And maybe they'll address that, and/or their relatively thin bench, with a trade-deadline move. \nBut again, even as currently constructed, the Timberwolves are one of just four teams who rank as a top-10 offense and defense. The other three (Oklahoma City, Houston and San Antonio) are widely considered top-tier contenders. The second half will tell us a lot about whether the Wolves belong in that same class.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Phoenix SunsNobody saw this coming from the Suns when they traded Kevin Durant and waived and stretched Bradley Beal. They were expected to be a total mess if we're being honest. Instead, they're one game back in the loss column of a top-four seed with a top-five net rating and the second-best defense in the league.   You could throw a dart blindfolded and have a good chance of hitting a Suns player having an incredible who is not being talked being talked about nearly enough. Collin Gillespie. Mark Williams. Grayson Allen. Royce O'Neale. Jordan Goodwin. Honestly, Devin Booker is flying under his relative radar; if he starts to shoot 3s at his normal clip, as opposed to the 30% mark he's put up through the first half, Phoenix can become a real threat to finish above the play-in and possibly upset someone in the first round.   \nBut the guy really worth highlighting here is Dillon Brooks, who is near the top of a short list of guys having All-Star seasons who have no chance of actually making the All-Star team, and whose villainous prints are all over a pestering defense that annoys you into submission; Phoenix leads the league steals and ranks in the top five in both deflections and loose balls recovered.   The Suns win by out-hustling you, and say what you want about Brooks, but whatever team he's on plays hard. He's a culture setter in that way. Memphis isn't the same without him. There was a reason Houston brought him in to establish its competitive, defensive-minded mantra under Ime Udoka last year, and now he's having the same effect in Phoenix.   We knew this about Brooks, though. He's going to defend. He's going to compete. He's going to talk his talk. But he's never scored like this. He's putting up over 20 a night. True, it has plenty to do with Brooks' ballooned usage rate (his overall scoring efficiency is still pretty meh), but he's never been short on scoring confidence and this season he's showing that maybe it wasn't always so irrational after all.   This guy gets buckets. Tough ones. He gets his body into you and converts shots that sometimes look like he shouldn't even be able to get them off cleanly. He does it on and off the ball. Over 30% of his field-goal attempts are spot-up jumpers, per Synergy, and his 1.09 PPP as a pick-and-roll scorer ranks right in line with Anthony Edwards and better than a long list of superstars that includes Luka Dončić, Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant.   In isolation, he scores at the per-possession rate of Jalen Brunson.   In the post, he's more efficient than Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.   His 8.1 PPG on pull-up jumpers ranks near the top of the league and is notably more than the likes of Cade Cunningham, Austin Reaves and De'Aaron Fox.   Brooks is probably destined to shoot the Suns out of a playoff game, but if they get there in the first place, he'll be a big reason why. Personally, I'm fascinated to watch them try because I, like many others, thought this team would be a disaster. Now they're one of my favorite watches and should be one of yours, too, as the best underdog story the NBA has going.   \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Golden State WarriorsSteve Kerr took a beating from the bloggers when he said the Warriors are \"not in the same class\" as teams like the Thunder and Spurs anymore, as if he was saying he's given up on the team. Taking any sort of long view, he was right. Those teams are where the Warriors were a decade ago, at the start of what looks almost certain to be an extended reign atop the competitive landscape.   That said, Kerr elaborated by saying the Warriors are still a \"good, competitive team\" that is simply looking to give itself a \"swing at the plate.\" That's what the Warriors gave themselves in 2022, and they connected for the fourth championship of the Steph Curry era with a team absolutely nobody considered to be a real threat halfway through the season.   Can they do it again? Probably not. But this team is more dangerous than its 24-19 record entering play on Monday. Curry remains at or very near the height of his powers. There is real depth here. A bunch of guys can shoot the ball. Draymond Green remains extremely impactful. Jimmy Butler is having a great season and perhaps might be willing to assert himself even more in the second half.   \nMeanwhile, the defense has ranked in the top five for much of the season. The offense has been top five since Christmas. As their brutal early schedule has stabilized, they've won 11 of their last 15 games. This remains the same team that went 22-5 after the Butler trade last season and was a good bet to make the conference finals had Curry not gotten hurt against the Wolves in Game 1 of the second round.   Actually, this is a better team than that one. De'Anthony Melton is a huge addition from last season who's been playing great. Al Horford still has chance to make the impact he wasn't really able to during the first half of the season as he dealt with injuries. Jonathan Kuminga will probably be traded at the deadline, so whoever comes back in that deal is going to be a bonus as Kuminga is currently a zero. If they get really frisky and give up some draft capital for, say, Michael Porter Jr. or Trey Murphy III, buckle up.   But again, even as currently constructed, the Warriors can make a lot noise over the second half and into the playoffs (which, at the moment, would have to come via the Play-In Tournament yet again). To continue with the baseball analogy, over time, the Warriors are no longer in a position to hit for a high championship-contending average. But if they can work or even luck themselves into a favorable count (somehow get to the first round of the playoffs, get the right matchup, have the bracket break their way, get super hot from there), it's at least fun to imagine that Curry and company might still be capable of connecting on one last swing for the fences.   \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The end of the regular season doesn't just close the book on another year in the NFL. For some franchises, it also coincides with a reevaluation of the entire organization, which can result in various firings. While some clubs made changes midseason, the more common time we see head coaches and GMs be let go comes the day after the regular season concludes, better known as Black Monday. At that juncture, we saw six teams move off of their head coach: Falcons, Browns, Cardinals, Raiders, Ravens, and Dolphins. More recently, Steelers entered the coaching carousel after Mike Tomlin stepped down, while the Bills are now looking for a head coach after firing Sean McDermott following another early playoff exit. Pair that with the two head coaching vacancies (Giants and Titans) that were already open due to firings during the season, and you have more than 25% of the league looking for a new head coach. The Falcons and Dolphins also entered this period looking for a new GM as well. So who fills all of these positions? With the Band-Aid ripped off, those teams are now beginning the process of finding their next leader. Below, we'll chronicle that pursuit by tracking the latest interviews and interview requests by each team. \nFollow live updates on NFL coaching and GM changes, firings and rumors.Head coaches\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Arizona CardinalsPrevious head coach: Jonathan GannonAfter three seasons on the job, the Cardinals decided to move on from Jonathan Gannon. He went 15-36 as the organization's head coach, which included a 3-14 season in 2025. Arizona ended the year on a nine-game losing streak.

Harbaugh was the NFL's second-longest tenured head coach after Mike Tomlin in Pittsburgh, who knocked him out of the playoffs with a Week 18 victory that may have clinched his departure. While this is the end of an era in Baltimore, the Ravens suddenly become the top available job in the NFL simply due to the presence of two-time NFL MVP Lamar Jackson. Completed interviewsMike McDaniel -- former Dolphins head coach (team announcement)Jesse Minter -- Chargers defensive coordinator (team announcement)Jim Schwartz -- Browns defensive coordinator (team announcement)Brian Flores -- Vikings defensive coordinator (team announcement)Anthony Weaver -- Dolphins defensive coordinator (team announcement)Kliff Kingsbury -- former Commanders offensive coordinator (team announcement)Matt Nagy -- Chiefs offensive coordinator (team announcement)Kevin Stefanski -- former Browns head coach (team announcement)Klint Kubiak -- Seahawks offensive coordinator (team announcement)Davis Webb -- Broncos quarterbacks coach (team announcement)Vance Joseph -- Broncos defensive coordinator (team announcement)Interview requestsRobert Saleh -- 49ers defensive coordinator (ESPN)Joe Brady -- Bills offensive coordinator (NFL Media)Nate Scheelhaase -- Rams pass game coordinator (ESPN)Chris Shula -- Rams defensive coordinator (Sports Illustrated)Joe Brady -- Bills offensive coordinator (NFL Media)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Buffalo BillsPrevious head coach: Sean McDermottFollowing a loss to the Denver Broncos in the divisional round, the Bills decided to move on from McDermott.

Hafley joins a Miami organization during a pivotal period, particularly due to the uncertainty at quarterback. \nPrevious head coach: Mike McDanielThe Dolphins waited a bit longer to make a decision regarding Mike McDaniel's future with the organization, firing him on the Thursday afte the regular season. Initially, it looked as if McDaniel had saved his job, but Stephen Ross, after a meeting this week to discuss the season, decided to cut bait and go through a total reset. It's slated to be transformative offseason in Miami, as it now needs a new head coach and general manager and is likely to move on from Tua Tagovailoa. General managers\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Atlanta FalconsPrevious GM: Terry FontenotAtlanta cleaned house after the 2025 season, not only firing Raheem Morris but also parting ways with general manager Terry Fontenot. He had been with the organization in this GM role since 2021 and was able to add some intriguing skill position players like Bijan Robinson and Drake London, but was unable to get a concrete plan in place at quarterback. A clear plan at that position will likely be the main emphasis for owner Arthur Blank, and newly hired president of football Matt Ryan as they comb through candidates this time around. Interview requestsIan Cunningham -- Bears assistant general manager (CBS Sports lead NFL insider Jonathan Jones)Josh Williams -- 49ers director of scouting and football operations (CBS Sports lead NFL insider Jonathan Jones)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Miami DolphinsHIRED: Jon-Eric Sullivan -- Packers VP of player personnel.

He started as a scout in 2000 and stayed with the franchise ever since, ascending to GM in 2016. Miami made the playoffs just three times over his 10-year stint as GM, and has been under .500 in each of the last two seasons, due to an inability to build a stable roster. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        After an abbreviated stop in Hawaii, the 2026 PGA Tour schedule begins the West Coast Swing with The American Express 2026 beginning on Thursday at the Pete Dye Stadium Course in La Quinta, Calif. After skipping the one-week Hawaii Swing, World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler is set to make his 2026 debut as part of The American Express field. The four-time major winner hasn't played particularly well in this event, however, recording just one top-10 finish in five tries. Still, the 2026 American Express odds list Scheffler as the clear-cut +300 favorite (risk $100 to win $300). Ben Griffin, ranked No. 8 in the world, is next on the PGA odds board at +1900, with Robert MacIntyre at +2000 and Ludvig Aberg at +2200. Before locking in any 2026 American Express picks, or making any PGA DFS picks on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up over $8,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.This same model has also nailed a whopping 16 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- as well as this year's PGA Championship and Open Championship. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting sites. \nNew users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Now that the 2026 American Express field is locked in, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard. 2026 American Express predictions One major surprise the model is calling for at The American Express 2026: Sam Burns, one of the favorites at +2500, stumbles and barely cracks the top 10. He's a golfer to avoid at La Quinta this week. Burns had some highlights in 2025, including finishing T7 at the Tour Championship after a strong playoff run. There were also some low points as well like going nine straight tournaments without a top-20 finish, including three straight missed cuts in that run. He has a pair of top-10 finishes at The American Express, but no top-5s, and he finished T29 last year, so the model doesn't like him as a top contender this week. See who else to fade here. \nAnother surprise: The model calls Matt Fitzpatrick a top-four contender this week even though he's tied for the eighth-lowest odds at +3000. He's a golfer to target if you're looking for a big return. This will be his debut at The American Express, but he finished 2025 strong with four top-10 finishes in his last six events. He finished the season 34th in Strokes Gained: Total and 30th in Strokes Gained: Putting, making him a golfer to target with slightly longer odds this week. See who else to pick here. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:How to make 2026 American Express picksThe model is also targeting three other golfers with odds of +2700 or higher as top-10 contenders. You can only see the model's picks here. \nWho will win the 2026 American Express, and which longshots will stun the golfing world?

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The Cincinnati Reds are bringing back a familiar face. The Reds and third baseman Eugenio Suárez have agreed to a one-year contract worth $15 million, reports ESPN. The deal includes a mutual option for 2027. The team has not yet announced the signing. Suárez, 34, played for the Reds from 2015-21 and had his greatest success in Cincinnati, including a 49-homer season in 2019. He split last season between the Arizona Diamondbacks and Seattle Mariners, hitting .228/.298/.526 with 49 homers. Suárez was much better before the trade (.897 OPS) than after (.682 OPS), which may have hurt his market. We ranked Suárez as the 14th-best free agent this offseason and was the top hitter remaining on the market entering February. Here' the write-up: \nSuárez is a min-max experiment at the plate. He hits the ball hard,  as evidenced by his second career 49-homer season, and he takes his  share of walks. All the while, he ranked near the bottom of the majors  in both whiff and strikeout rate, something that can be attributed in  part to his weakness on pitches located up and in. Suárez will likely  face scrutiny based on his age (35 come July), defense (not great), and  right-handedness. When his bat goes, his spot on a roster will, too, at  whitewater speeds. Until then, Suárez ought to find a home in the middle  of a lineup. \tKe'Bryan Hayes is owed $36 million through 2028 and is maybe the best defensive third baseman in the sport. He won't be relegated to the bench to make room for Suárez. Suárez will almost certainly DH and perhaps play some first base, which will cut into playing time for incumbent first baseman Spencer Steer and top prospect Sal Stewart. All three players are right-handed hitters. The Reds snuck into the postseason via tiebreaker over the New York Mets last season. Their offense was lacking at times, however. They finished 14th in runs and 21st in home runs, which isn't bad, but can certainly be improved upon. Prior to Suárez, Cincinnati's only additions on offense this offseason were platoon outfielders JJ Bleday and Dane Myers. \nLast year's 83-79 finish was the Reds' best since posting the same record in 2021. It was their first postseason berth since 2020, and their first in a full 162-game season since 2013. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        On Sunday at 6 p.m. ET, the NBA will announce the reserves for the 2026 All-Star Game. We already know the starters: Stephen Curry, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Luka Dončić, Victor Wembanyama and Nikola Jokić in the Western Conference; Jalen Brunson, Tyrese Maxey, Cade Cunningham, Jaylen Brown and Giannis Antetokounmpo in the Eastern Conference.The format of the actual All-Star Game will not be East vs. West. This season, it's the United States versus the rest of the world, with two teams of U.S. players and one team of international players. \n        \n            \n                NBA Slam Dunk Contest participants: Lakers' Jaxson Hayes, Spurs' Carter Bryant accept invitations, per report\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nNone of this is relevant for this exercise, though -- as usual, NBA coaches will vote in seven reserves from each conference. Just like with the starters, it's positionless.Let's pretend that I'm an NBA coach (lmao). Here are my picks:Eastern ConferenceDonovan MitchellScottie BarnesMichael Porter Jr.Jalen JohnsonJalen DurenNorman PowellPascal SiakamI put down the first five names without a second thought. Mitchell, who is scoring at a higher volume and with greater efficiency than ever before, was on my official ballot as a starter. Barnes' shooting has fallen off as the season has gone on, but he's been awesome at everything else and should be a lock for First-Team All-Defense. Porter has reinvented himself in Brooklyn -- he's now an offense unto himself, even though he's still doing the vast majority of his damage off the ball. Johnson has continued his evolution as the new face of the Hawks, averaging a triple-double in December and making the most of his increased offensive responsibility. Duren is not a go-to guy, but has taken a huge step forward as a scorer while reliably rebounding and protecting the paint for the East's toughest -- and, so far, best -- team.\nAfter that, it was tricky. The Powell selection is not because it'd be a great story, but, man, what a great story! He was picked No. 46 in the 2015 draft, and he could make his first All-Star appearance in his 11th season at the age of 32. For a Heat team that desperately needed shot creation, Powell has been a blessing and an absolute bucket. He is averaging a league-best 0.503 points per touch, essentially duplicating what he did last year in a totally different system. I shudder to think where Miami would be if he hadn't fallen into its lap last summer.If you'd have disqualified Siakam based on the Pacers' record, I get it, and I have a feeling the coaches might be with you. Porter's Nets aren't much better, though, and Siakam is definitely not to blame for the Pacers' lack of success. To me, it's not just the solid efficiency at high volume -- often in a treacherous offensive environment with more defensive pressure than he's ever seen -- that seals the deal. It's that, unlike most of the other candidates for this spot, there's nothing about his individual season to complain about. Siakam could have sulked through this gap year, but instead has played his ass off on both ends and repeatedly come up clutch for a team whose playoff hopes evaporated in November. His biggest problem is that he can't play every second of every game -- Indiana has been 15 points per 100 possessions better with him on the court than without him in non-garbage-time minutes, per Cleaning The Glass.Honorable mentions/potential injury replacements: Bam Adebayo, Evan Mobley, Karl-Anthony Towns, OG Anunoby, Derrick White, Kon Knueppel, Joel Embiid, Franz Wagner, Brandon Ingram, Josh Giddey\nWestern ConferenceAnthony EdwardsKawhi LeonardKevin DurantJamal MurrayDevin BookerDeni AvdijaChet HolmgrenThe competition is stiffer in the West, so this group will require a bit more explanation. In the case of Edwards, though, little needs to be said. I voted him in as a starter, and he's taken steps forward this year as a decision-maker, 3-point shooter and post scorer. Kawhi Leonard was a no-brainer for me, too, given that he's been perhaps the best player on the planet for the last six weeks or so and is averaging a career-high 27.9 points on a career-high 63.1% true shooting while defending like a maniac and hunting pull-up 3s. Durant is 37 years old and logging 37 minutes a game for a Houston team that can't space the floor but has an elite offense anyway. He's uber-efficient from everywhere, as always, and has given the Rockets exactly what they wanted when they traded for him. As the season has progressed, they have become more reliant on him. He's as deserving of his 16th All-Star appearance as Jamal Murray is of his first. Murray should have been a lock before Jokić's injury, and his play since then has only strengthened his case. He's been one of the league's best shooters and most clutch performers this season, essentially doing the Playoff Murray thing from opening night onward. Booker's numbers haven't changed all that much since last season, but everything else about his situation has. With Durant no longer in the picture and opponents throwing everything at him, Booker has upped his scoring on a per-possession basis with only a marginal drop in efficiency. He's compensated for a dip in 3-point accuracy by getting to the line at a career-high rate, and he's given several teammates the space they needed to have breakout seasons, leading the Suns to a 28-19 record, which precisely nobody saw coming.\nThe Wizards apparently don't regret trading Avdija, but Portland sure is thrilled to have him. Pressed into a much more ball-dominant role than anticipated, he has become the league's most prolific driver and one of its best foul-drawers. He turns the ball over too much and needs to improve his pull-up 3, but his production makes him the favorite for Most Improved Player. I think it should also make him a first-time All-Star.I could have gone a few different ways with the last spot. In the end, I settled on Chet Holmgren, and I promise this isn't just an \"OKC should have two All-Stars\" thing. Holmgren has anchored the league's best defense and scored extremely efficiently. Holmgren is not the creator that Alperen Sengun or James Harden is, but he'll be in the running for DPOY.Honorable mentions/potential injury replacements: Sengun, Harden, Jimmy Butler, Rudy Gobert, Julius Randle, Lauri Markkanen, Keyonte George, Austin Reaves, LeBron James, Cooper Flagg\n            ",

In the main event, former junior welterweight champion Jose Valenzuela will take on Diego Torres.Valenzuela started his career 12-0 before running into Edwin De Los Santos in 2022. That night, Valenzuela suffered a third-round knockout for the first loss of his career. That loss was followed by a widely disputed decision loss to Chris Colbert. Valenzuela would get revenge against Colbert in an immediate rematch, scoring a sixth-round knockout with a devastating right hand.Sign up for Paramount+ and watch Zuffa Boxing 02 live on Sunday night for no additional fee. Plus, every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with the price of your subscription! Plans start as low as $8.99/month or $89.99/year!The win over Colbert was enough to set Valenzuela up for the biggest fight of his career, a shot at Isaac \"Pitbull\" Cruz for the WBA junior welterweight title. Valenzuela made good on the opportunity with a measured performance to edge out a split decision in a major upset.\nValenzuela was unable to repeat that solid performance in his first title defense -- and most recent fight -- when he was nearly shut out by Gary Antuanne Russell to lose the belt.Valenzuela will now look to get back in the win column when he faces Torres, who has fought all but one of his career bouts in his native Mexico.\nThat lone fight in the United States was also Torres' lone professional loss, a 2023 TKO defeat against Raymond Muratalla. That loss has aged well as Muratalla has gone on to become the current IBF lightweight champion.\nTorres has rebounded from the Muratalla loss with four consecutive wins, including two by stoppage.There are other notable names on the three-fight main card, including former WBC interim junior middleweight champion Serhii Bohachuk taking on Radzhab Butaev, who is a former WBA \"regular\" welterweight champion, and former WBC light heavyweight champion Oleksandr Gvozdyk facing former world title challenger Radzhab Butaev.Let's take a look at the odds for each bout as well as how you can catch the action on Sunday before getting to a prediction and expert pick on the main event below.\nZuffa Boxing 02 fight card, oddsOdds via DraftKings SportsbookJose Valenzuela -800 vs. Diego Torres +500, lightweightsSerhii Bohachuk -175 vs. Radzhab Butaev +140, middleweightsOleksandr Gvozdyk -550 vs. Radivoje Kalajdzic +380, light heavyweightsWhere to watch Zuffa Boxing 02Date: Feb. 1 | Location: Meta APEX -- Las VegasPrelims begin at 6 p.m. ETMain card begins at 9 p.m. ETWatch live: Paramount+ (subscribe now for just $8.99 per month)PredictionAs mentioned, Torres' lone career loss came against the best fighter he has fought and in the United States. The fight with Valenzuela is very similar for Torres. Like Muratalla, Valenzuela is considerably better than the rest of the fighters on Torres' resume. And Torres is having to come to America again to take on another big challenge. This should be a chance for Valenzuela to get off to a solid start in his Zuffa Boxing debut.

    "body": "\n        Michael Carrick has three wins out of three to start his tenure as Manchester United's head coach, this time with a dramatic 3-2 win against Fulham on Sunday that allowed the Red Devils to assert themselves as contenders to finish inside the Premier League's top four.In a back-and-forth affair against Fulham, United took a 2-0 lead by the 56th minute thanks to goals from Casemiro and Matheus Cunha, though the visitors had essentially gone toe-to-toe with Carrick's side for much of the game. Fulham had outshot United nine to six just before Cunha scored, and the teams were almost level on expected goals – United had 0.89 xG tallied by that point, while Fulham clocked in at 0.8. The Cottagers continued to go toe-to-toe with the hosts even after going two goals down – both teams had 12 shots each by the 84th minute, though United edged out Fulham at that point with 1.58 xG to 1.14.\nFulham finally reaped the rewards for their effort with two goals in six minutes. Harry Maguire was booked for a challenge on Raul Jimenez, who converted a penalty in the 85th minute after a stutter-step routine, while Kevin notched the equalizer in the first minute of stoppage time in stunning fashion. He received the ball on the left flank and then played it to Ryan Sessegnon, who quickly sent it his way before Kevin took a shot from the corner of the penalty area, beating Senne Lammens in the process.United, though, scored a game-winner three minutes later with their final shot of the game. Bruno Fernandes, with his second assist of the day, won the ball near the right endline and sent it towards Benjamin Sesko, who was making a run into the box. Sesko received the ball at the penalty spot but took a heavy touch so the ball drifted away from him, though he ran towards it and then took a shot while turning and nabbed his fifth Premier League goal of the season in the process.\nUnited's strong start under Carrick, which included surprise wins against Manchester City and Arsenal, thrust them into fourth place, rising from seventh place before the ex-United player took charge in the days after Ruben Amorim's firing. They currently boast a one-point lead over Chelsea and a two-point advantage over Liverpool with 14 games to go.Carrick has benefitted from inheriting one of the Premier League's top attacks this season – by the time Amorim left the club, the Red Devils ranked third for goals scored with 34 in 20 matches and 36.14 expected goals. In some sense, their attacking output has not changed all that much – they average 1.6 expected goals per game so far under Carrick, slightly below their Premier League average all season of 1.8 xG. They have truly overperformed in that category in the last three games, though, averaging 2.7 goals per game since Carrick took over when their average for the season 1.8 goals. Cunha, in particular has been in good form under Carrick with a goal contribution in each of his matches.Whether or not there is a so-called Carrick effect is hard to determine, though. Signs point to their improvement starting back on Matchday 13. Though the foes he has faced so far have been of a high caliber, one could also make the argument that United lucked out that the City team they faced was – and still is – inconsistent, their loss in the Manchester derby a mess of their own making. The same was perhaps true for Arsenal, who crumbled at one of the first signs of adversity in a title charge that has otherwise been remarkably smooth. Fulham, meanwhile, actually beat United on expected goals on Sunday when all was said and done, the Cottagers generating 1.97 xG from 14 shots while the Red Devils trailed just behind with 1.74 xG from 13 attempts.\nThe jury's still out on what Carrick's spin on United will look like, though his strong start will likely allow him some wiggle room as he figures things out. He, at the very least, seems to have created a positive environment for a group of players who have not strayed off course all that much during a campaign in which they can put last season's disappointment in the rearview mirror.\"He's said this many, many times,\" Sesko said post-match of Carrick's insistence that players should enjoy competing for United. \"It's not just that. You can see without the ball how hard we work and it's working out in the end. Everyone is on point, covering the space, everything. In the end, that's what counts.\"Carrick's United, though, are now well-positioned to go on a run that should afford them some cushion in a still-competitive race for the UEFA Champions League spots. Five of their next six opponents in Premier League play are in the lower half of the table, including upcoming fixtures against a completely out-of-form Tottenham Hotspur and relegation contenders West Ham United.\n            ",

The Roos are playing out the string this season under departing coach Marvin Menzies; the school announced in January that it was moving on from Menzies' four-year run at season's end. Kansas City, which is 4-18 and ranks near the bottom of Division I this season, made the move official and announced Turgeon's hiring Sunday afternoon.Turgeon, who turns 61 on Feb. 5, has a 479-275 record across 23 and a half seasons. He began his career at Jacksonville State, then Turgeon upped his profile in a seven-year stint at Wichita State, including a 2006 Sweet 16 appearance. From 2007-11, Turgeon ran Texas A&M's program and took the Aggies to four straight NCAA Tournaments. That landed him his biggest job: Maryland. Turgeon had an NCAA Tournament-level team in six of his nine full seasons in College Park, though he only took the Terrapins to the Big Dance five times due to his 24-7 team not getting a chance to play in the canceled 2020 NCAA Tournament. He took over the Terps in 2011, lasting a little more than a decade. Turgeon resigned from his post at Maryland on Dec. 3, 2021, amid a rocky start and toxic situation with the fan base.\nA little more than four years removed from roaming the sidelines, Turgeon is hopping back into the profession. He does so in surprising fashion by heading to the Summit League level; it's conceivable Turgeon could have landed a bigger job in March, when dozens more will inevitably come available. Turgeon has ties to the area: He played at Kansas in the 1980s and grew up in Topeka, Kansas. A source said that Turgeon will bring his son, Will, on staff as well.Kansas City AD Brandon Martin made a significant push on Turgeon in the past two weeks (and a source said it's not the first time he tried to court a former power-conference coach). Martin ultimately swayed Turgeon, and in doing so, the Roos will boast one of the most accomplished coaches at the mid-major level.\nKansas City (formerly UMKC) has been in Division I since the late 1980s but never made the NCAA Tournament. \n            \n    ",

With a few notable-name free agents and trade candidates still on the board even at this increasingly late hour, there's a daily supply of rumors. Speaking of which, you can find Sunday's roundup just below. White Sox acquire Hicks from Boston\nThe Boston Red Sox have traded right-hander Jordan Hicks and right-handed pitching prospect David Sandlin to the Chicago White Sox in exchange for right-handed pitching prospect Gage Ziehl and a player to be named, ESPN and MassLive.com report. Hicks, 29, is one of the hardest throwers in baseball, and he has experience as both a reliever and a starting pitcher. Last season, he pitched to a 6.95 ERA and an FIP of 4.35 in a combined 67 ⅓ innings for the Red Sox and Giants. For his career, he has an ERA+ of 91 across parts of seven MLB seasons. Over that span, Hicks has made 37 starts and 238 relief appearances. He's under contract through the 2027 season and is owed $12.5 million for each of the next two seasons. The White Sox will be picking up the majority of Hicks' remaining commitment. As for Sandlin, he turns 25 on Feb. 21, and he's a former 11th-rounder out of the University of Oklahoma. He was originally drafted by the Royals. Sandlin has a 4.38 ERA in four minor league seasons -- 47 starts and 18 relief appearances -- with 279 strikeouts in 232 innings as a pro. He reached the Triple-A level in 2025. \nThe 22-year-old Ziehl, a fourth-rounder in 2024 out of the University of Miami, has an ERA of 4.12 and a K/BB ratio of 4.74 in his lone minor league season. He made 22 starts and one relief appearance. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Las Vegas Raiders aim to hire Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak as coach, NFL Media reports. The deal cannot become official until after Super Bowl LX, when Kubiak and the Seahawks take on the New England Patriots.Kubiak, 38, directs one of the NFL's top offenses with Sam Darnold at the helm. Prior to his year in Seattle, Kubiak was the New Orleans Saints' offensive coordinator in 2024, and before that, he worked as the San Francisco 49ers' pass game coordinator under Kyle Shanahan. He also worked under his own father, Gary Kubiak, as well as Kevin Stefanski with the Minnesota Vikings. Several aspects of his father's offense as well as the Shanahan and Stefanski offenses are seen in his offenses. Seattle ranked second this season in under-center rate and seventh in play-action dropback rate. The Seahawks led the NFL in yards per attempt on play action passes, too.Overall, the Seahawks' offense was eighth in points per game and yards per game, sixth in yards per play and second in net yards per pass attempt. Darnold and Jaxon Smith-Njigba (NFL-leading 1,793 receiving yards) both made the Pro Bowl.With Klint in line to become coach, he and Gary Kubiak will be the 10th father-son head-coaching duo in NFL history, joining ...Brian and Marty SchottenheimerKyle and Mike ShanahanBrian and Bill CallahanDave and Don ShulaRex and Buddy RyanWade and Bum PhillipsMike and Dick NolanJim Mora Jr. and Jim MoraJohn and Jim FasselSan Francisco 49ers offensive coordinator Klay Kubiak -- Klint's brother -- also received some head-coaching interest this hiring cycle.\nKlint Kubiak, who also interviewed with the Arizona Cardinals, will have his work cut out for him in Las Vegas. The Raiders come off a dismal 3-14 campaign under Pete Carroll, who got fired after one season. On the bright side, the Raiders own the No. 1 pick in the NFL Draft and are widely expected to select Heisman Trophy- and national championship-winning Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza. The Raiders have several holes to fill, though, and the offensive line will be the biggest question mark. Pro Football Focus graded Las Vegas as the 28th-best pass-blocking unit and the 30th-best run-blocking unit.There is some young talent, though, led by tight end Brock Bowers and running Ashton Jeanty. Bowers caught 112 passes for 1,194 yards as a rookie in 2024 before an injury-impacted 2024. Jeanty, meanwhile, finished with 1,321 yards from scrimmage and 10 touchdowns even with underwhelming surroundings. He recorded 188 yards from scrimmage and two touchdowns in Week 16 against the Houston Texans, one of the league's premier defenses.\nOn defense, one of Kubiak's first tasks will be dealing with the Maxx Crosby situation. Crosby was shelved for the season late due to a knee injury, a decision with which Crosby vehemently disagreed and left him pondering his future. Kubiak could aim to bring some Seattle defensive coaches with him to Las Vegas as he builds his staff.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        If records are indeed meant to be broken, no one apparently told the teams and players who have played in some of the recent Super Bowls. As we get ready for Super Bowl LX, a number of the Super Bowl's oldest records remain untouched despite some of being set before the creation of the fifirst Nintendo. Former Raiders linebacker Rod Martin has held the record for interceptions in a Super Bowl (three) for 45 years. No one has come within 40 yards of Timmy Smith's Super Bowl single-game rushing record in the 38 years since he rumbled for 204 in Washington's blowout win over the Broncos. A year after Smith's record-setting day, Jerry Rice racked up 215 receiving yards in the San Francisco come-from-behind win over the Cincinnati Bengals, a Super Bowl record that still stands to this day. One of those records has a decent shot a getting broken when the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks square off. Here's a rundown of that and several other records that might fall during the Super Bowl's 60th edition. Most Super Bowl wins: 6 Record-holders: Patriots, Steelers The Patriots are just one win away from having the record for most Super Bowl wins all to themselves. \nEach of New England's Super Bowl wins have come under the ownership of Robert Kraft, a former Patriots season-ticket holder who purchased the franchise in 1994. It didn't take long for the franchise to have success under Kraft; the Patriots reached the Super Bowl in 1996 (losing to the Green Bay Packers) and won their first Super Bowl title in 2001 after upsetting the heavily favored Rams. Patriots Super Bowl results GameOpponentScoreMVPXX (1986)BearsL, 46-10 DE Richard Dent (Chicago)XXXI (1997)PackersL, 35-21KR/PR Desmond Howard (Green Bay)XXXVI (2002)RamsW, 20-17QB Tom Bady (New England)XXXVIII (2004)PanthersW, 32-29QB Tom Brady (New England)XXIX (2005)EaglesW, 24-21WR Deion Branch (New England)XLII (2008)GiantsL, 17-14QB Eli Manning (New York) XLVI (2012)GiantsL, 21-17QB Eli Manning (New York) XLIX (2015)SeahawksW, 28-24QB Tom Brady (New England)LI (2017)FalconsW, 34-28 (OT)QB Tom Brady (New England)LIII (2018)EaglesL, 41-33QB Nick Foles (Philadelphia)LIII (2019)RamsW, 13-3WR Julian Edelman (New England)LX (2026)Seahawks??????The Patriots' 12 Super Bowl appearances are already a Super Bowl record. No other NFL franchise has more than eight trips to the big game. Youngest QB to win the Super Bowl: 23 years, 340 days Record-holder: Ben Roethlisberger, Steelers (Super Bowl XL) Patriots quarterback Drake Maye can break Roethlisberger's record 20 years after Big Ben won the Super Bowl at the end of the second season with the Steelers. At 23 years and 162 days old, Maye will become the second-youngest quarterback to start in a Super Bowl. Hall of Famer Dan Marino was 23 years and 127 days old when he and the Dolphins faced the 49ers in Super Bowl XIX. While the game wasn't close (the 49ers pulled away in the second quarter en route to a 38-16 win), the game was nonetheless a showcase of two of the greatest quarterbacks of all time in Marino and Joe Montana. Marino's 318 yards that day tied Terry Bradshaw's single-game Super Bowl record for passing games. Montana, however, broke that record by throwing for 333 yards and three touchdowns. He also ran for 59 yards (a then Super Bowl record for a quarterback) and added a touchdown on the ground.  Longest field goal: 57 yardsRecord-holder: Harrison Butker, Chiefs (Super Bowl LVIII) Given the accuracy of today's kickers from long range, it's a little surprising that there hasn't been a longer made field goal in the Super Bowl. That could change this year given the two kickers who will be taking part in the game. Patriots rookie kicker Andres Borregales had a season-high 59-yard field goal during the regular season and made each of his four field goal attempts from at least 50 yards out. Seattle kicker Jason Myers' season-high 57-yard field goal this season matches the Super Bowl's single-game record in terms of distance. He booted a 59-yarder in 2024 made a career-long 61-yard field goal attempt back in 2021. Myers made all nine of his kicks (including all three of his field goal tries) in Seattle's first two playoff wins. Borregales made each of his six point-after attempts and four of his six field goal attempts during New England's first three playoff games. Most receiving yards: 215Record-holder: Jerry Rice, 49ers (Super Bowl XXIII)Rice set his still-standing record just one year after Washington receiver Ricky Sanders recorded a then-Super Bowl record 193 yards in a blowout win over the Broncos. Rice's record-setting performance helped the 49ers rally to defeat the Bengals in one of the greatest Super Bowls ever played. There are several notable players in this Super Bowl who could break Rice's record, most notably Seattle's Jaxon Smith-Njigba, whose dominance this season has conjured up memories of Rice. While he's never eclipsed 180 receiving yards in an NFL game, Smith-Njigba had a whopping 347 receiving yards in college during Ohio State's comeback win over Utah in the 2022 Rose Bowl. Smith-Njigba, who caught 15 passes and three touchdowns in Ohio State's 48-45 win, set an all-time FBS bowl game record for receiving yards. It's been 37 years since Jerry Rice set the Super Bowl record for receiving yards. His 11 receptions for 215 yards led to him becoming the third receiver to earn Super Bowl MVP honors.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Most catches: 14Record-holder: James White, Patriots Super Bowl (LI) While it was eventually tied four times, no one broke former Bengals tight end Dan Ross' single-game Super Bowl record for receptions (he caught 11 passes for 104 yards and two touchdowns in Super Bowl XVI) until former Broncos wideout Demaryius Thomas pulled down 13 passes during Denver's Super Bowl loss to Seattle in 2014. White broke Thomas' record three years later while also scoring the first overtime touchdown in Super Bowl history as the Patriots overcame a 28-3 deficit. Smith-Njigba has a chance to break this record, too. Ironically, his career single-game receptions mark in the NFL was set against the Patriots. He caught 12 of 16 targets for 117 yards during Seattle's 23-20 overtime win over New England in Week 2 of the 2024 season. White's record-setting performance helped spearhead the greatest comeback in Super Bowl history.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Most return yards: 244Record-holder: Desmond Howard, Packers (Super Bowl XXXI) Like Howard did for the Packers nearly 30 years ago, Rashid Shaheed's special teams prowess this season has played a key role in the Seahawks' Super Bowl run. Shaheed, who started the season in New Orleans before being dealt before the deadline, earned his second career Pro Bowl nod this year after returning a punt and a kickoff for touchdowns. He returned the opening kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown during Seattle's eventual rout of San Francisco in the NFC divisional round. In Super Bowl XXXI, then-Patriots coach Bill Parcells decided to kick to Howard late in the third quarter despite Howard's success up to that point in the game. Howard made him pay by returning a kickoff 99 yards that proved to be the game's final score. It'll be interesting to see if current Patriots coach Mike Vrabel takes a similar approach regarding Shaheed. Howard remains the only special teams player to win Super Bowl MVP honors.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Highest completion percentage: 88%Record-holder: Phil Simms, Super Bowl XXI Simms was simply on fire in leading the Giants to their first Super Bowl win. He was actually a perfect 10 of 10 in the second half as the Giants turned a 10-9 halftime deficit into a 39-20 win over the Broncos. Simms finished the game with 268 yards and three touchdowns on 22 of 25 passing. While Simms isn't worried about his record falling, there's a chance that either Maye or Seattle quarterback Sam Darnold could break it in this year's Super Bowl. Maye completed a league-high 72% of his passes during the regular season and had two games where he completed over 90% of his throws. It should be noted, however, that both of those performances came against two of the NFL's worst teams in the Jets and Titans. Darnold completed at least 82.4% of his throws in three games this season, including completing a season-high 87.5% of his passes in a win over Washington. Like Maye, though, Darnold's most efficient games this season from a completion percentage standpoint came against several of the league's worst teams. No one has come within five points of Simms' 88% completion percentage in Super Bowl XXI.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Most combined punts: 22 Record-holder: Giants/Ravens, Super Bowl XXXV I'm sure that no one is hoping that this record comes close to being broken in this year's Super Bowl, that is unless you're a fan of defensive rock fights. While both teams possess top five scoring offenses, they have have two of the league's best defenses. Seattle and New England finished first and fourth in the NFL during the regular season in fewest points allowed, respectively. As John Madden used to say, a great defense usually beats a great offense. If that comes to fruition on Sunday, it could lead to a low-scoring, defensive affair that could include a slew of punts by both teams. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        LONDON -- Halftime in a game, Manchester City are leading 2-0, and if you're in attendance, or perhaps just watching on from afar, muscle memory takes over. You know this game is done. They'll ping it about for half an hour, the other team will wear themselves down and then City will add a bit of gloss to the scoreline at the death.If only, Pep Guardiola might ask himself, such a scenario were as deeply ingrained in his players as it is those who have seen his side dominate English football for the last decade. Right now, his team look like title challengers for 45 minutes, midtable scrappers for the rest. Maybe Tottenham's fightback today says more about the spirit and quality of Thomas Frank's side than it does the limitations of Guardiola's, but I wouldn't be so sure. If these were two points stolen by Spurs, then how to explain those taken by Manchester United, Brighton and Chelsea since the turn of the year.Something changes when City hear that halftime whistle. Whatever it is, it will probably cost them the Premier League title.\"We talk about it,\" said Guardiola of his side's issues after the break. \"The managers change tactics in the second half. When you played really, really poor in the first, you can make some substitutions and say guys this didn't work, we'll put the wingers narrower or wider or I don't know.\n\"We started really well, except one transition action in the second half. It was the goal; it changed things a little bit.\"City's second-half slumps2025-26 Premier LeagueFirst halfSecond halfGoals scored2722Goals conceded616Expected goals for23.6819.43Expected goals against7.7218.36Expected goal difference15.961.07Penalty box touches383440Penalty box touches allowed171301Possession61.9%56.5%Pass completion89.2%87.2%Passes per attacking sequence54.1Of all the points frittered away after the interval, these might be the most egregious. After all, this is the first time since April 2018 that a two-goal halftime lead for City did not result in a win, a run of 115 games across all competitions. Few of those that came before would have seemed as well situated. With 45 minutes played, the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium was on the brink of mutiny again. They had seen their side bullied by a City side that needed only to wait for a Spurs defender to chuck the ball to them in the attacking third. Rayan Cherki finished brilliantly for the opener but only after Radu Dragusin had backed halfway down the High Road, the perfect follow-up to Yves Bissouma's dawdling in central areas. Look back over City's attacking sequences in the first half and it is stark how their openings come in those short sharp sequences but what else is a team to do when Radu Dragusin is lobbing the ball to Rodri?Analysis of the first half attacking sequences in Tottenham's 2-2 draw with Manchester City \n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            At least they showed themselves capable of getting the ball down and cycling through their possession game. In the first half the average Manchester City possession lasted 8.9 passes and over 25 seconds (in the second those would collapse to 6.2 and 18.4). Spurs were losing their cool chasing after Rodri et al, typified in a Randal Kolo Muani shove on the Spaniard that somehow did not result in a yellow card. The fans were booing when Antoine Semenyo drilled in the second, plenty were in the bars long before the whistle and a few did not come back.They had abandoned faith but Thomas Frank had not. He has done little of late to earn himself credit from Spurs supporters but removing the ill Cristian Romero and switching to a back four gave Conor Gallagher and the newly introduced Pape Matar Sarr the chance to apply some muscle to midfield. \"I'm extremely happy that we finally got a point out of a big second half,\" said Frank. \"This team's ability to respond to setbacks and show itself, we're showing it bit by bit. We are showing more consistency, we are more competitive, it's going in the right direction.\"Xavi Simons was getting quick ball in space with licence to roam. Momentum came through a contentious early goal, Dominic Solanke seeming to connect with Marc Guehi rather than the ball as he battled with the defense to turn in Simons' through ball.Better City teams than this one would have taken that as the wake-up call they needed. Instead the game continued to happen to a side who are supposed to have title aspirations. \"The momentum is difficult to control, whatever happens in England,\" admitted Guardiola. The pace with which City played went up and the threat went markedly down. Each teams sequence profile in the second half of Tottenham's 2-2 draw with Manchester City \n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            Champions in waiting tend not to fritter away two-goal advantages, even if there was nothing they could do about Solanke's spectacular scorpion kick of an equalizer. If they do, they will at least mount a fight to get back into the lead. There were a handful of half openings for City: a set-piece scramble that resulted in Guehi scooping the ball over the bar, Erling Haaland nodding down for Tijani Reijnders to flick wide.The late shove never really came, though. Spurs seemed just as likely a winner at the death when Wilson Odobert was denied by the outstretched boot of Gianluigi Donnarumma. There was never any suggestion of City wrestling back that momentum that was so hard to control, even when Nico Gonzalez joined Rodri in the engine room. It was the same story from the United defeat, the draws with Brighton and Chelsea, even moments in wins over Wolves and Galatasaray. There was a team growing in purpose and belief early on and it wasn't City.Some of that can be explained by the specific experiences of playing on the road, \"the crowd and energy\" that Guardiola referenced against Tottenham was almost as impressive as Old Trafford roaring its side on in the Manchester derby. Plenty more is explained by the broader tactical trends of the Premier League, teams intent on playing long and quick, games defined more by second balls and set pieces than who can complete a few dozen passes in the pivotal moments. Guardiola's explanation deserves consideration too. The Premier League has never been more blessed with coaching talent and the on-field quality isn't too shabby either. When Frank shuffled his pack at halftime, he was able to turn to an AFCON winner in Sarr, even while Spurs were addled with injuries, there were still quicksilver attacking talent like Mathys Tel and Odobert.This cannot just be explained by what has happened to City though. Guardiola and those tasked with signing him talent have had well over a year to adjust to first Rodri's injury and then his diminishing powers, the great conductor of the Etihad orchestra only his old self in flashes. Their attack looks to have sacrificed its own ability to control the game in its sublimation to Haaland and, while Antoine Semenyo looks to be an effective running mate early in his career, this is not a team that can easily weather the cold streak that has hit their No .9. As to why so many of these issues burst forth in the second half, perhaps it takes a bit of a can't lose vibe from the opposition in the second half. Perhaps City's legs aren't what they were.It doesn't really matter because in the second half that really counts, City are being found wanting, a win, a defeat and three draws so far on the back 19, allowing Arsenal to open up a six-point lead. Just as they could not maintain their ascendancy in the second half here, so they are slipping away in the title race.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Sunday was a massive day in women's hoops -- 20 of the teams in the AP top 25 played, and seven games were between ranked opponents. It was so good we dubbed it \"Super Sunday\" in the lead-up, and the day certainly lived up to that moniker.  We had upsets, historic performances, a rivalry game settled in OT and even a Vic Schaefer jacket toss. If you missed any of it, have no fear, we have you covered. Here are the winners and losers from Feb. 1's action:Winner: UConn's winning streakThe No. 1 Huskies are still undefeated with a perfect 23-0 record thanks to a 96-66 win over No. 15 Tennessee. This one was particularly important because the Lady Vols were their last non-conference opponents and the toughest challenge remaining on their schedule.Tennessee gave UConn a battle in the first half. After a slow start, the Lady Vols fought back and led 40-36 before the break. This was the Huskies' first time trailing in the second quarter all season.\nWhile nothing guarantees UConn staying unbeaten in Big East play, there are no teams in the conference that, at least on paper, seem like they could currently challenge Geno Auriemma's squad. The Huskies have a target on their back, but this result should give them an extra boost of confidence.\nUConn is currently on a 39-game winning streak, but its last loss came to Tennessee last year. Azzi Fudd said she was \"angry, frustrated, embarrassed\" regarding her own performance in that loss, which included three turnovers, three personal fouls and just three field goals. Things were much different this time around. Fudd had 27 points via 11 of 17 shooting from the field, including five 3-pointers. She also had seven rebounds, seven assists, seven steals and even a block. -- Isabel GonzalezLoser: Tennessee's second halfThe Lady Vols beat UConn last year and then put the Huskies on upset alert in the first half of Sunday's game. That effort would have made Tennessee a winner, even if it ended up being a close loss. However, this turned into a 30-point loss, which is the largest margin of victory in series history. UConn now leads the series 18-10 since 1995, which includes winning five out of the last six matchups.\nThings started going wrong halfway through the third quarter. Tennessee went scoreless in the last 4:45 of the period while UConn went on a 14-0 run. The Lady Vols couldn't find the momentum again and have now lost back-to-back games. UConn is the toughest opponent in the nation, but Tennessee really struggled to take care of the ball. By the end of the night, Kim Caldwell's team had given up 36 points off 20 turnovers. -- Isabel GonzalezWinner: The Michigan vs. Michigan State RivalryTechnically, No. 13 Michigan State lost this game in overtime to No. 9 Michigan, 94-91, but this felt like one of those games that boosted everyone's profiles. After all, IInés Sotelo was centimeters away from winning it for the Spartans at the buzzer, but her halfcourt heave rimmed in and out.It was a phenomenal game with a total of 17 lead changes and 13 ties. Both teams shot well -- the Wolverines were 57% from the field and 41% from outside, while the Spartans shot 51% and 46%. The biggest lead for Michigan was eight points, the biggest lead for Michigan State was four points, and it was a one-possession game after each period. Mila Holloway led the way for Michigan with a career-high 26 points, six rebounds and five assists, while Jaylen Brown and Kennedy Blair both had 21 points for the Spartans, with Blair adding 10 rebounds, four assists and three steals.\nAs I mentioned in my preview, this was the first time in history that a Michigan vs. Michigan State women's basketball game has been played when both teams were ranked in the top 15. Games like this one will go a long way to turn this regional rivalry into a national attraction and elevate the profile of women's basketball inside the state and out. And the best news of all? There's a rematch in two weeks. -- Lindsay GibbsLoser: Clarity in the Big 12Headed into Sunday, one of my biggest questions was who would take control of the Big 12. With the two teams tied for first at the top of the conference, No. 12 TCU and No. 14 Baylor, playing the teams right behind them in the standings, No. 21 Texas Tech and No. 22 West Virginia, it seemed either Baylor and TCU would separate from the field or one of them would finally get some room at the top. Instead, West Virginia upset Baylor 70-60 and Texas Tech upset TCU 62-60, and now the Big 12 is a bigger question mark than ever. Baylor and TCU are still tied for first, but neither can be feeling confident right now.West Virginia had Baylor uncomfortable from the opening tip, and the Mountaineers ended up scoring 38 points on a staggering 30 Baylor turnovers. The Mountaineers also outscored the Bears 36-8 in the paint. TCU, meanwhile, lost the game on the boards and at the free-throw line; Texas Tech out-rebounded the Horned Frogs 46-34 and was 13 of 17 from the stripe, compared to Baylor's 3 of 5. -- Lindsay Gibbs\nWinner: Texas Tech's Snudda CollinsOut of all the big wins today, I'm probably most impressed with the performance of Texas Tech during its upset of TCU. The Red Raiders started the season a historic 19-0, but came into Sunday having lost three of their last four, and it was tempting to write them off as an early-season feel-good story. But by taking down TCU, Texas Tech proved that there was nothing flukey about their start and stayed in contention for a top-16 seed.And the main reason why Texas Tech's momentous season is back on track is senior guard Snudda Collins, who matched her career high with 28 points on Sunday, including a crucial 3-pointer with just 32 seconds remaining to put the Red Raiders up 57-55. Collins also had 28 points in Texas Tech's rout of Utah last week, meaning right when her team started to slip, Collins started playing the best basketball of her career. -- Lindsay GibbsLoser: Iowa's paint prowessThe No. 8 Hawkeyes are not usually a bad team near the rim. In fact, they dominated Ohio State in this area 42-14 in their most recent win. However, the tables turned in their 88-65 loss to No. 2 UCLA. Iowa just didn't have an answer in this area and the Bruins certainly took advantage of it. By the end of the third quarter, UCLA had scored more points in the paint than Iowa had scored overall. After 40 minutes, the Bruins had crushed the battle in the paint 56-26.\nWhen asked about what made it so difficult for Iowa, Hannah Stuelke highlighted UCLA center Lauren Betts' size and defense.\"I think they are really good on the inside,\" she said. \"Obviously, Lauren Betts is 6-foot-7 and it's hard to score on 6-foot-7.\"\nAs for Iowa coach Jan Jensen, she said Betts, who scored 16 points, knows how to make good decisions on offense.\"A double team can't really, I don't think, slow down Betts as much. Because I don't think she forces anything ill-advised against the double. She kind of squares ups and then she rockets it to (Gianna Kneepkens). So do you want to give up two or do you want her throw it out for three?\" -- Isabel Gonzalez\nWinner: LSU's historic offenseAfter an 0-2 start in SEC play, the No. 6 LSU Tigers have now won seven consecutive games, and they made a statement with their 103-63 victory against No. 24 Alabama. That was the 12th time this season that LSU reached the 100-point mark, which is the most by any Division I team in the last 25 seasons.It was a full team effort with eight players scoring at least eight points. Jada Richard led the way with 16 points while shooting a perfect 5 of 5 from the field, including three 3-pointers. The game started out close, but the second quarter was key for LSU to start separating itself. The Tigers forced eight turnovers while Mikaylah Williams scored 11 of her 15 total points in those ten minutes. They found a 49-29 lead at halftime and never took their foot off the gas.\nThe Tigers' bench leads the nation in scoring, and they were business as usual on Sunday with a total of 47 points. ZaKiyah Johnson put up 15, while MiLaysia Fulwiley contributed 10. -- Isabel Gonzalez\nLoser: The field's hopes for a No. 1 seedOne of the most hotly anticipated games of the day was the SEC showdown between No. 4 Texas and No. 10 Oklahoma, but even though the final score -- 78-70, Texas -- doesn't look that lopsided, it always felt like the Longhorns were in complete control of the game. Madison Booker and Rori Harmon both played well, and most notably, they got help from their supporting cast -- Justice Carleton had 16 points and eight rebounds, Jordan Lee added 14 points and Aaliyah Crump added 12 from the bench. Meanwhile, Oklahoma's star freshman Aaliyah Chavez was held to just 11 points on 3 of 13 from the field.All year long, last year's Final Four teams -- UConn, South Carolina, UCLA and Texas -- have been in the top four of the rankings. After Texas suffered losses to LSU and South Carolina, I felt it needed a win over the Sooners to keep itself from falling behind the top of the pack. That's exactly what the Longhorns achieved on Sunday. And when you combine that with the dominant wins from UCLA and UConn, it seems increasingly unlikely that those four teams are going to be displaced on the No. 1-seed line. There's a lot of basketball left to play, and a No. 1 seed doesn't guarantee anything, but I'd feel safe pencilling them in.\n            ",

    "body": "\nFrom NFL player props to Patriots vs. Seahawks (-4.5) picks against the spread, to over/under picks (45.5), to money-line picks (Seahawks -230, Patriots +190), your 2026 Super Bowl parlay can go in a number of different directions. Another option is guessing the margin of victory of the game, and there's an NFL betting trend that could help in that regard. Entering Super Bowl LX, three of the last four editions of The Big Game have been decided by exactly 3 points. So, you could back the game's winning margin to be exactly 3 points in a 2026 Super Bowl SGP, which would return +475.Seattle winning by 3 points has +950 NFL prop odds, while New England doing the same carries +1100 odds. You could also make NFL bets on winning bands, with Seattle prevailing by 1-6 points at +275. But if you want to increase your potential winnings exponentially, then you could string one of these wagers with others into a lucrative Super Bowl same-game parlay. There are countless 2026 Super Bowl picks with plus-money payouts you can target, from alternate lines to anytime TD scorers to exact score predictions. Before making any Super Bowl 60 picks and NFL parlays, you need to see the epic Super Bowl LX same game parlay from SportsLine's proven model that pays out $15,000 on just a $10 bet.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters the 2026 Super Bowl on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024.

Despite ranking 68th amongst wideouts in catches (33) in the regular season, Boutte was 18th in positional receiving touchdowns (6). He added another score in the Divisional Round and then got a redzone target in the AFC Title Game. While Seattle has an elite defense, through the air is where to exploit that unit. Eight of the last 10 touchdowns the Seahawks have allowed have been via the pass, including all three they gave up in the NFC Title Game.Boutte has more touchdowns this season than the Pats leading receiver, Stefon Diggs, despite the latter having twice as many targets and receptions. The model projects Boutte to score 0.31 touchdowns, which is the highest amongst all Patriots and brings great value to these plus-money odds as one leg of a Super Bowl SGP. See the rest of the picks in the Super Bowl LX same game parlay here, and you can bet Boutte as an anytime TD scorer using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nHow to make NFL parlay picks for a payout of $15,000The parlay also includes three additional Super Bowl picks from SportsLine's NFL model, including a must-see first NFL touchdown-scorer prop that pays out 25-1.

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The San Francisco 49ers are expected to hire Raheem Morris as their defensive coordinator, per CBS Sports lead NFL insider Jonathan Jones. Morris was fired as Atlanta Falcons coach following the end of the 2025 season. He replaces Robert Saleh after Saleh took the Tennessee Titans' coaching job.Morris, 49, went 8-9 in both seasons in his most recent stint in Atlanta. He also served as an interim coach there in 2020 and also coached the Tampa Bay Buccaneers from 2009-11. Overall, he has a 37-56 record as a head coach.However, Morris has an extensive background as a defensive coach, including as the Los Angeles Rams' defensive coordinator from 2021-23, a stretch that included a Super Bowl victory. He was also the Falcons' defensive coordinator in 2020 before taking over as interim coach.\nMorris broke into the NFL in 2022 with the Buccaneers as a defensive quality control coach and rose to defensive backs coach before he was hired as head coach at just 32 years old. After three years in that role, he joined Washington as the secondary coach, where he was on the same staff as current 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan. Morris and Shanahan were also on the same staff in Atlanta in 2015 and 2016, when Morris worked on both sides of the ball and Shanahan was the offensive coordinator.The 49ers struggled defensively in 2025, but many of those struggles can be attributed to injuries. Nick Bosa (ACL) and Fred Warner (ankle) both missed double-digit games, and first-round rookie Mykel Williams only played roughly half the season after tearing his ACL. The 49ers still managed to make the playoffs, where they beat the Philadelphia Eagles before losing to the Seattle Seahawks.\nSan Francisco had one of the NFL's least-productive pass rushes, something that will certainly be an area of focus for Morris. San Francisco spent each of its first five picks in 2025 on defenders, and their development will be crucial.\n            \n    ",

For the first time in the history of The Big Game, each team ranks in the top four in both scoring offense and scoring defense, providing a balanced Super Bowl 60 matchup. New England (14-3) went on the road to defeat Denver, 10-7, in the AFC Championship Game, while Seattle (14-3) held off the Rams, 31-27, to claim the NFC Title Game. The 2026 Super Bowl is a rematch from 11 years ago when the Pats prevailed 28-24 to win Super Bowl XLIX. New England quarterback Drake Maye didn't practice on Friday due to an illness. Kickoff is at 6:30 p.m. ET from Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif.

They enter Super Bowl LX with a 16-1 record over their last 17 games, which is not a record that even Seattle can measure up to. New England has incredible balance, ranking second in points scored and fourth in points allowed, with the offense specifically standing out. Drake Maye combines both efficiency with a big-play ability as he leads the league in both completion percentage and yards per pass attempt. Meanwhile, the defense is playing its best entering Super Bowl Sunday as New England has given up one or fewer touchdowns in each of its last five games. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Seahawks can coverIt's hard to find any holes with Seattle, including in regard to the spread, as it has both the most covers and the best cover percentage of the regular plus postseason. The Seahawks are the only NFL team to rank in the top three in both scoring offense and scoring defense, and just five teams had more takeaways in the regular season. Mike Macdonald's crew also boasts top-10 rankings on both the ground and thru the air, but the defense is the star of this team. Seattle leads the NFL in points allowed, third-down defense, yards per rush allowed and yards per pass attempt allowed while ranking second in yards per play given up and rushing touchdowns allowed. No. 1 scoring defenses, like what Seattle has, also have a great history in this game, with a 14-4 all-time Super Bowl record. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Seahawks vs. Patriots picksSportsLine's model has simulated Patriots vs. Seahawks 10,000 times and is going Under on the total, projecting 44 combined points.

Jannik Sinner has won back-to-back titles in the men's singles, and he is the -115 favorite to defend his title again this year. Aryna Sabalenka lost to Madison Keys in last year's women's singles final, but she has appeared in three straight finals. She is the +200 favorite to get past other contenders like Iga Swiatek (+600) and Elena Rybakina (+750).  The opening day of action features matches like Venus Williams vs. Olga Danilovic (3 a.m. ET) and Carlos Alcaraz vs. Adam Walton (4:30 a.m. ET).

He currently ranks among the tour's best in both service games held and return games won on outdoor hard. His win rate against top-10 opponents on the surface is outstanding, and his tiebreak record highlights how well his game holds up in pressure moments. If he's fully healthy, there's no better anchor at the top of the board.\"New users can get a first bet matched up to $250 with the latest Caesars promo code. You can claim the offer here: Carlos Alcaraz (+180)\"While Alcaraz has yet to win in Melbourne, he's already claimed Slam titles on every other surface and remains one of the most complete threats in the game,\" Onorato said. \"His hard-court metrics remain elite, with a win rate above 75 percent over the past two years and one of the highest return points won percentages against second serves. He's beaten nearly every top seed in both best-of-three and best-of-five conditions and has the physicality and resilience to handle the tough back end of a Slam. If anyone is going to stop Sinner, this is the most logical challenger.\"New users can target the all-new DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: Alex De Minaur (+7000)\"The home crowd will be behind him, but it's not just narrative. De Minaur has quietly put together a strong stretch on outdoor hard, improving his serve and finishing more points early in rallies,\" Onorato said. \"His physical conditioning is elite, and he's become more willing to step into the court and dictate when given time. He's posted quality wins over top-10 players in recent months, and his rally tolerance and court speed make him well-suited for long matches in the Australian heat. If the draw breaks his way, he could be the unexpected name in the semifinals.\"New users can get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 bet with the latest FanDuel promo code.

She's won multiple Australian Open titles and has reached the final three years in a row,\" Onorato said. \"Her power game thrives in quick conditions, and her ability to win short rallies makes her perfectly suited to this surface. Statistically, she ranks near the top of the WTA in first-serve points won, ace rate, and short-rally points (0–4 shots). If she serves well, there are very few women who can stay with her for three sets. She should be considered the top contender again in 2026.\"New users can get a first bet matched up to $250 with the latest Caesars promo code. You can claim the offer here:Iga Świątek (+600)\"Swiatek has yet to lift the trophy in Australia but remains one of the most reliable all-surface performers on the WTA. Her return game is unmatched, consistently ranking among the top two or three in return games won. She also tends to dispatch lower-ranked opponents in straight sets, which helps manage physical load across the two weeks,\" Onorato said. \"While she hasn't looked quite as comfortable on hard as she does on clay, her numbers on the surface remain elite. If her serve holds up, she's just as dangerous as Sabalenka over the course of a Slam.\"With the latest BetMGM bonus code, new users can get up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses. Claim the offer here: Mirra Andreeva (+1700)\"At just 18 years old, Andreeva already has a Slam semifinal under her belt and the tactical maturity of a veteran. Her ability to vary pace, absorb power, and construct points gives her a real shot on hard courts,\" Onorato said. \"She's posted wins over multiple top-10 players, and her game holds up under pressure. Her return positioning and ability to redirect pace make her particularly tough in fast conditions. If she handles the early rounds cleanly, her all-court game could carry her into the second week once again.\"New users can get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 bet with the latest FanDuel promo code.

That will bring it confidence, as will defeating San Francisco, 13-3, when it last took the field in Week 18. That tied for the fewest points by the Niners since Kyle Shanahan's debut season in 2017, and now San Fran will have to adjust to life without George Kittle (Achilles) while facing Seattle's No. 1 scoring defense. Additionally, the NFL schedule makers didn't do San Francisco any favors with giving it a short week after a Sunday Wild Card game on the other coast in Philadelphia. Teams are 5-10 in the playoffs since 2002 with a short week versus a team coming off a bye, and the Seahawks franchise is 10-1 over its last 11 home postseason games. See which team to back at SportsLine.Bet Darnold to go Over 1.5 passing touchdowns at DraftKings:\nHow to make 49ers vs. Seahawks picksRoberts has analyzed Seahawks vs. 49ers from every angle and he's leaning Over on the point total.

    "description": "\n        The third round of the 2026 Sony Open saw players again challenged by windy conditions in Honolulu, Hawai'i, and with 18 holes left to play, ",
    "body": "\n        The third round of the 2026 Sony Open saw players again challenged by windy conditions in Honolulu, Hawai'i, and with 18 holes left to play, Davis Riley has taken the solo lead at Waialae Country Club. Riley was tied for the lead with three others after the second round, but on a difficult afternoon, his 3-under 67 was the best of the lead pack and moved him into first alone, two ahead of the field.Riley spoke after his strong second round about how his putter was carrying him, and that continued Saturday with another terrific effort with the flat stick, picking up 2.614 strokes on the field in the third round on the greens. He leads the field in strokes gained putting for the week, and if he can keep the putter warm on Sunday, he'll put himself in position to pick up his third career win. Leading the charge behind Riley on the leaderboard are Harry Hall and Chris Gotterup. Hall shot one of the best rounds of the day with a 4-under 66 to move to 10 under and get one back of the lead going into Sunday. Gotterup matched Riley's 68 to stay attached as he carries momentum from a strong close to 2025 into the start of his 2026 season, making clear his surge wasn't a fluke. The round of the day belonged to Corey Conners and Hideki Matsuyama, as two of the top-ranked players and best ball-strikers in the field handled the challenging conditions better than anyone else to post 5-under 65s and climb the leaderboard. \nHeading into the weekend, there are nine players within three shots of the lead and 19 players within five shots, setting up an intriguing final round where plenty of players will feel like they have a legitimate shot at the first PGA Tour title of the 2026 season. Leader1. Davis Riley (-12): Riley's hot putter has been the story of the week so far, but his ball-striking seems to be improving as the week goes on, which will be critical if he's going to convert a 54-hole lead into a victory. Saturday was the first round of the week Riley gained strokes both off the tee and approaching the green, and that part of his game will have to hold up under the final round nerves right alongside his putter. ContendersT2. Harry Hall, Chris Gotterup, Kevin Roy (-10)T5. Ryan Gerard, John Parry, Nick Taylor (-9)T8. Corey Conners, Adam Svensson, Patrick Rodgers (-8)T11. Si Woo Kim, S.H. Kim (-7)T13. Hideki Matsuyama, Jordan Spieth, Robert MacIntyre and three others (-6)\nThere is a sizable chase group, headlined by Hall and Gotterup, but Roy has been near the top of the leaderboard since Thursday and hasn't shown any indication he'll simply fade away on Sunday. Taylor is the defending champion, and while a stumble early on his back nine caused him to slip out of the lead for the first time all week, a closing birdie kept him in touch. He's still got to be considered a significant threat to go back-to-back at Waialae. The rest of the big names in the top 20 will need something rather spectacular to win, but the likes of Conners and Matsuyama showed on Saturday that they're capable of it. Spieth has been the most consistent player of the week, which is not normally an attribute we think of first with Spieth, but three consecutive rounds of 68 have him in the hunt for at least a top 10 in his first start to an extremely important season for him. 2026 Sony Open updated picks, oddsOdds via FanDuel SportsbookDavis Riley (23/10)Harry Hall (47/10)Chris Gotterup (5-1)Nick Taylor (10-1)Kevin Roy (11-1)Ryan Gerard (11-1)John Parry (14-1)Corey Conners (16-1)Riley's birdie at the last made him the clear favorite going into Sunday's final round. Of the chase group, Gotterup and Roy are intriguing. Gotterup proved his ability to close out a win last year and is a strong wind player. Roy has been impressive all week, and just two back at 11-1, he offers some value as long as he continues his level of play from the first 54 holes.\n            ",

The game kicked off at 3 p.m. ET. The LA Bowl, which saw Washington defeat Boise State 38-10, kicked off at 3:30 p.m. This was an unusual situation, as Army vs. Navy is played a week after conference championship games and, for many years, with no other football games in the time slot. CBS Sports has been the broadcaster of Army vs. Navy since 1996 and holds the rights until 2038.Trump's full Truth Social post:\n\"The Army-Navy Game is one of our Greatest American Traditions - Unmatched Patriotism, Courage, and Honor! This incredible Tradition is now at risk of being pushed aside by more College Playoff Games, and Big TV Money. NOT ANYMORE!\"Under my Administration, the second Saturday in December belongs to Army-Navy, and ONLY Army-Navy! I will soon sign a Historic Executive Order securing an EXCLUSIVE 4 hour Broadcast window, so this National Event stands above Commercial Postseason Games. No other Game or Team can violate this Time Slot!!!   \"On the field, they are rivals, but on the battlefield they are America's unstoppable Patriots, defending our Country with tremendous Strength and Heart. We must protect the Tradition, and the Players, who protect us. Please let this serve as Notice to ALL Television Networks, Stations, and Outlets. God Bless America, and God Bless our great Army-Navy Game!!!\"Trump's statement does not specify whether the order will extend beyond football games to include other sports scheduled for early December. However, his reference to postseason football could imply more than bowl games. As reported by CBS Sports, some proposals to expand the College Football Playoff to 24 teams include moving Army vs. Navy up a week to the first Saturday in December.An executive order \"has the force of law within the executive branch,\" Jill Hasday, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Minnesota, explained in a 2017 interview with CBS News. Trump has used them extensively in his second term, setting a record for orders issued in the first 100 days after retaking the presidency in January 2025. Executive orders carry over to subsequent presidents, though they may be overturned.\nThe Army-Navy game has been played annually, uninterrupted, since 1930, though the rivalry began in 1890. Navy currently holds the series lead at 64-55-7. President Trump attended the most recent edition of the historic rivalry. The first president to attend the game was Theodore Roosevelt in 1901.\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        The Atlanta Falcons have hired Kevin Stefanski as their next coach, the team announced on Saturday. The addition of Stefanski is the first major move made by the Falcons since hiring franchise legend Matt Ryan as the president of football earlier this month. Stefanski, who replaces Raheem Morris, was fired Jan. 5 by the Cleveland Browns after six seasons. He posted a 45-56 record and two postseason appearances during that span. He won the AP Coach of the Year award twice in Cleveland, but was let go after going 8-26 combined over the last two seasons. Despite the recent struggles, he immediately became a hot commodity on the coaching market. \"We're thrilled to land a lead-by-example leader in Kevin Stefanski who brings a clear vision for his staff, our team and a closely aligned focus on building this team on fundamentals, toughness and active collaboration with every area of the football operation,\" Ryan said in a statement. \"Coach Stefanski is a team-first leader who puts a premium on accountability for everyone and a player-driven culture. \"His experience in Cleveland and Minnesota has given him a great understanding of the importance of working in sync with scouting, personnel and the rest of the football staff to maximize talent across the roster and in doing everything possible to put our players in the best position to succeed. Kevin's style of leadership, combined with the staff and infrastructure in place here in Atlanta, gives us confidence in our shared vision for the team and we are excited to have him as the leader of our football team.\"\nThe Falcons will hope Stefanski can help their offense improve from 2025 when they finished 24th in the NFL in scoring. The Browns' offense struggled in Stefanski's last two seasons, finishing in the bottom two in the NFL in scoring both years. However, the quarterback situation in Cleveland has been dire since Baker Mayfield's departure, as the Deshaun Watson signing turned into a disaster for the Browns and many around the league point to the quarterback rotation, not coaching, as the reason the Browns struggled. In Atlanta, Stefanski will have Michael Penix Jr. entering his third season in the NFL but coming off another ACL injury that ended his season in November. Penix completed 60.1% of his passes for 1,982 yards, nine touchdowns and three interceptions prior to his injury in the 10th game of the year. Kirk Cousins played well in his eight starts, including the final four wins that put Atlanta into a three-way tie atop the NFC South at 8-9 with the Carolina Panthers winning the tiebreaker. \nThe Falcons haven't won the division since 2016 when they went to the Super Bowl and haven't had a winning season since 2017. Stefanski certainly has experience taking a struggling franchise and quickly getting them to the playoffs, as he took the Browns to the playoffs in his first season in Cleveland, snapping a 17-year postseason drought. \n            ",

The scoring spree for the Broncos started when Bo Nix hit Lil'Jordan Humphrey for a 29-yard touchdown pass with just 22 seconds left to play in the first half. \nThe scoring play gave the Broncos a 17-10 lead. After the ensuing kickoff, the Bills took over on their own 30-yard line with just 16 seconds left in the second quarter, and at that point, it probably would have made sense to just let the half in, but instead, the Bills tried to make something happen. On a first-and-10 play, Josh Allen couldn't find an open receiver, so he decided to scramble and he ended up fumbling after taking a hit from Nik Bonitto. \nThe Broncos recovered the ball with two seconds left in the first half, which was just enough time for Wil Lutz to hit a 50-yard field goal. In a span of just 22 seconds, the divisional playoff game went from a 10-10 tie to the Broncos leading 20-10. There's only been one other instance in the Super Bowl era where a team scored 10 points in the final 30 seconds of the first half and that came in a divisional playoff game between the Cowboys and Packers back in January 1994. In that game, the Cowboys hit a 41-yard field goal with 28 seconds left in the half. The Packers then fumbled away the ensuing kickoff and Troy Aikman made them pay by throwing a 6-yard touchdown pass to Jay Novacek. The 10-point spurt gave the Cowboys a 17-3 lead at halftime in a game they ended up winning 27-17. As for the Bills-Broncos game, Allen has struggled with turnovers. Not only did he fumble at the end of the first half, but he also fumbled on Buffalo's opening drive of the second half. He also threw an interception in the third quarter and if you combine that with a James Cook fumble, the Bills have turned the ball over four times through three quarters. \nFor the latest updates from the game, including the score, be sure to check out our live blog here. \n            \n    ",

Green Bay conceded an 18-point lead in the second half despite four touchdown passes from franchise quarterback Jordan Love.\"Of course [I want to return]. This is one of one,\" LaFleur said. \"I love this place. I love the people. As much as you guys drive me nuts sometimes, I love you guys. I love our players, the locker room, everybody in our organization. I mean, this is a unique place. The community has been outstanding. I grew up in the Midwest and it's got the same type of vibe that I grew up [with] in Mt. Pleasant, Michigan. \"So, people are just -- unless you're from here, you don't understand, I think, how friendly everybody is. And it's nice no matter who you are, you're walking down the street, and people say hello to one another. I've lived other places, so I think this is a unique place, this is a special place. My kids love it here, my family loves it here.\"\nLove gave LaFleur his seal of approval after the Packers' ill-fated fourth quarter against the Bears, who scored 25 points in the final frame to win.\"Yeah, I definitely think Matt should be the head coach. I've got a lot of love for Matt. I think he does a great job. And that's it,\" Love said.\nLaFleur is currently the Packers' fourth-winningest coach with 76 victories, trailing only Vince Lombardi (89), Mike McCarthy (125) and Curly Lambeau (209). His 76 regular-season wins are tied for the second-most by a coach in his first seven seasons in NFL history, along with Hall of Famer Paul Brown.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Kentucky rallied from a 17-point deficit to stun No. 24 Tennessee 80-78 on the road Saturday, as the Wildcats completed their third straight double-digit comeback in SEC play.Just as they did at LSU on Wednesday — when Kentucky rolled from 18 down to win at the buzzer — veteran guards Denzel Aberdeen and Otega Oweh led the charge against the Volunteers.Oweh's transition dunk with 34 seconds remaining gave UK (12-6, 3-2 SEC) its first lead of the game at 78-77 and prolonged a dreadful finishing stretch for the Volunteers (12-6, 2-3), who did not make a basket from the field over the final 5:38.The senior guard finished with 10 points and two steals in the second half. Aberdeen scored 18 of his 22 points in the second half including seven straight to open the second half as Kentucky narrowed a 13-point deficit to eight. While Kentucky's comeback win over Tennessee bore some uncanny resemblance to its wins over LSU and Mississippi State, which also required big rallies, it illuminated the play of some different characters.\nMo Dioubate came off the bench to play 27 minutes, which is more than he logged in the last two games combined. The physical Alabama transfer provided some desperately needed toughness on the glass for UK after the Wildcats grabbed just one offensive rebound in the first half.\nWith Dioubate playing all but three minutes in the second half, UK grabbed 10 offensive rebounds, which it converted into 17 points. Consequently, Kentucky attempted 36 shots in the second half compared to just 22 for Tennessee. Freshman guard Jasper Johnson also added 12 points for Kentucky.Johnson's contributionsThere is mounting evidence to suggest Kentucky is a better team with Johnson on the floor. With UK's offense reeling early, the slender lefty kept the Wildcats in it with eight points off the bench in a span of fewer than six minutes. He also chipped in a couple of jumpers over the last three minutes of the first half just as Tennessee's lead ballooned to 17 points. Johnson's late surge helped the Wildcats close the half on a 7-1 run and remain within striking distance.\nIn addition to his 5-of-6 shooting performance, Johnson finished with a team-high four assists. He leads the team in assists per 40 minutes and is the most natural passer on the team now that Jaland Lowe has been ruled out for the season. Even before the strong offensive performance from Johnson, data showed UK has tended to be better with him on the floor. \nIn games against high-major opposition, five of the Wildcats' 10 most-efficient 3-man combinations involved Johnson, per CBB Analytics. Yet, he's still been struggling to get steady minutes. That ought to change moving forward. If anyone can replace the passing and on-ball playmaking that Lowe provided before UK shut him down for the season, it's Johnson, and he proved it again on Saturday at Tennessee.Bracketology implicationsThe win marks a gold-plated Quad 1 victory for Kentucky and improves the Wildcats to 3-5 in Quad 1 opportunities, providing significant insulation for the Wildcats' at-large resume. The win will have little risk of slipping outside of Quad 1, as there is virtually no scenario in which Tennessee will fall outside the top 75 of the NET. As a result, the Wildcats are expected to solidify themselves as a No. 9 seed in CBS Sports Bracketology, which calculates seedings as if Selection Sunday were tomorrow.\nThe initial CBS Sports Bracketology projection calls for Tennessee to slip from a No. 6 seed to a No. 7 seed. For the moment, the loss is a Quad 2 defeat for the Volunteers, marking their first loss outside of Quad 1. However, if UK moves into the top 30 of the NET (the Wildcats were No. 34 before the win), then it will be a Quad 1 loss.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        There's joy in Hoo-ville again after No. 16 Virginia showcased this week that a good November and a mostly fun December was not a mirage. Tuesday's road win over Louisville was impressive, but it came with a caveat: Cardinals star freshman point guard Mikel Brown Jr. was still sidelined. There are no stipulations Saturday. Virginia walked into Dallas and knocked off a talented SMU club, 72-68, to notch its fourth true road victory of the season.Virginia (16-2 overall, 5-1 ACC) is all the way legitimate and looks every bit the part of a second-weekend team that can dream of a Final Four appearance. The same Virginia program that watched Tony Bennett abruptly retire and proceeded to finish outside the top-100 in KenPom last season for the first time since 2009 is once again an ACC powerhouse.Steady, first-year coach Ryan Odom won't celebrate yet, but he's got this Cavaliers squad absolutely rolling. Saturday's upset victory will be a jewel on Selection Sunday and also offer proof-of-concept that this Virginia team can hold serve against real-deal athletes. Virginia has used beautiful ball movement and a barrage of size and shooting to build an offense that rates inside the top-15 nationally, but few teams on Virginia's slate could match the speed, height and power that SMU presents.UVa was more than up to the fight. It was Virginia who rocked SMU on the glass for 16 offensive rebounds. It was Virginia who never panicked in late-clock scenarios and went 4-for-4 down the stretch at the charity stripe to salt out a road win. It was Virginia's big men, who won their individual matchups against a SMU front-line that went toe-to-toe with Duke's Cameron Boozer last week. \nTough teams earn roadkills, and Virginia has mixed street-fighter grit with a gorgeous, layered, unselfish offense that can beat you inside, outside and everywhere in between. How did this happenDeep-in-the-weeds hoop heads started to obsess about the potential of this Virginia club after two fortunate dominoes went its way. Virginia had to be patient and work hard to get San Francisco transfer Malik Thomas an extra year of eligibility. That came through. Virginia had to be patient and work hard to get Belgium's 22-year-old Thijs De Ridder cleared to play college basketball. That also came through after the Fourth of July.That potential has turned into production. Thomas (23 points, six treys and 11 rebounds) and De Ridder (17 points, six boards) were instrumental in Saturday's upset, road victory that will be a jewel on Selection Sunday.\nThomas and De Ridder operate as No. 1 and No. 1A of this Virginia club, but the beauty of Virginia is its depth. Toledo transfer Sam Lewis has added size and shot-making. BYU veteran transfer Dallin Hall didn't make a single shot on Saturday, but he dished out nine assists. UC Irvine transfer Devin Tillis stepped up off the bench to splash three treys and finish with 11 points. Much-maligned former Kentucky and Kansas State big man Ugonna Onyenso shined with nine points and a block in his 17 minutes off the bench. Onyenso and freshman Johann Grunloh combined to help shut down SMU at the rim, holding the Mustangs to a miserable 6-of-14 shooting at the rim. When Virginia needs speed, Chance Mallory comes blitzing into the runway, just itching to go.It's coalesced into a beautiful mix. Virginia has four big men who can stretch the floor and defend. It has five guards who can pass, dribble and shoot. Virginia isn't one-sided, either. Virginia's defense now rates No. 17 nationally to go along with its No. 14-rated offense. \nInside the numbersPredictive metrics are in love with this squad. Virginia is up to No. 14 on KenPom after opening the season No. 59 in college basketball's Bible. This resume is certainly impressive, too. Road wins over Texas, NC State, Louisville and now SMU have helped Virginia soar in Wins Above Bubble, the new resume-grading metric that has been added to the seeding committee's team sheet.Virginia has added approximately +1.5 to its WAB this week alone. +0.8 for the Louisville win and +0.7 for the SMU victory. Virginia will likely rank inside the top 15 nationally in WAB after Saturday's action concludes.The resume is good.The predictive metrics are good.The eye test is good.It's Virginia, not North Carolina, that looks like the unquestioned second-best team in the ACC, and it's in the range of potential outcomes that Virginia, not big, bad Duke, has the best chance to make a run in the NCAA Tournament. \nThat Duke-or-Virginia conversation alone solidifies maybe the most important thing: Virginia basketball is back.\n            ",

They've added Jose Paradela, Agustin Palavecino, and Jeremy Marquez to the midfield in a clear goal of building a more balanced squad. Cruz haven't won the league since 2021 despite collecting the most points of any team in 2024-25 because their high-powered attack wasn't balanced by the rest of the team.With Liga MX having playoffs at the end of the season, points only mean so much when you'll have to take out the top sides in the league, and that's where Cruz Azul have struggled. Manager Nicolas Larcamon will be tasked with figuring out that puzzle, but an improved Puebla side won't go down easily, even with this being an away match for them. Cruz will be without Andres Montano, Jesus Orozco, and Kevin Mier but they also haven't lost to Puebla since 2023.It's expected for it to be an easy win for Cruz Azul but they have to ensure that they take the match seriously because Puebla will make it a fight. \nLiga MX schedule and scoresAll times EasternFriday, Jan. 16Mazaltan 1, Monterrey 5Saturday, Jan. 17Necaxa vs. Atlas, 6 p.m.Chivas Guadalajara vs. Querétaro, 6:07 p.m.Tigres UNAL vs. Toluca, 8 p.m.Cruz Azul vs. Puebla, 10:05 p.m. on CBS Sports Golazo NetworkClub Tijuana vs. Atletico San Luis, 10:06 p.m.\nSunday, Jan. 18Pumas UNAM vs. Club Leon, 1 p.m.Santos Laguna vs. Juarez, 6 p.m.Pachuca vs. Club America, 8 p.m.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Buffalo Bills suffered another painful playoff loss on Saturday, and to add to the pain, this loss came with some controversy. During Denver's 33-30 overtime win, the Broncos' game-winning drive was set up by an interception that shouldn't have counted, according to Bills coach Sean McDermott. With just under eight minutes left to play in overtime, the Bills were facing a third-and-11 from their own 36-yard line, so Josh Allen decided to throw a deep pass to Brandin Cooks. On the play, Cooks appeared to catch the ball, but after rolling on the ground, it was Ja'Quan McMillian who came up with it. \nIf Cooks was ruled to have control of the ball when his knee hit the ground, then the play would be over, but the officials ruled that Cooks didn't maintain control of the pass as he hit the ground so the ball was still live when McMillian snatched it. After the game, McDermott was asked about the play and he was upset for two reasons. For one, he didn't feel like the officiating crew took enough time to review the play. \n\"It's hard for me to -- and I've had a chance to look at it -- it's hard for me to understand why it was ruled the way it was ruled,\" McDermott said. \"If it is ruled that way, then why wasn't it slowed down just to make sure that we have this right. That would have made a lot of sense to me, to make sure that we have this thing right, because that's a pivotal play in the game. We have the ball at the 20 and we may be kicking a game-winning field goal right there, so I'll just leave it at that.\"An irate McDermott had even more to say after giving his initial answer. \"I'm saying it because I'm standing up for Buffalo, damn it,\" the Bills coach said. \"I'm standing up for us. What went on, that is not how it should go down, in my estimation. These guys spent three hours out there playing football, pouring their guts out. To not even say, 'Hey, let's slow this thing down.' That's where I'm bothered.\"McDermott was then asked if he thought the play should have been ruled a catch and he didn't hide his opinion. \n\"In my eyes, it was, but even if it wasn't, the players are owed, to me, 'Hey let's stop it, let's slow it down, let's put the head referee and give him a chance to look at the monitor,'\" McDermott said. After finishing his press conference, the Bills coach got interviewed again in a pool report and after thinking about the play some more, he was even more adamant that the officials made the wrong call on the field. \"That play is not even close,\" McDermott said, via WGR-550 in Buffalo. \"That's a catch all the way. I sat in my locker and I looked at it probably 20 times, and nobody can convince me that that ball is not caught and in possession of Buffalo. I just have no idea how the NFL handed it, in particular, the way that they did. I think the players and the fans deserve an explanation.\"\nFollowing the game, referee Carl Cheffers gave that explanation when he was asked why the play was ruled an interception. \"The receiver has to complete the process of the catch,\" Cheffers said in the pool report. \"He was going to the ground as part of the process of the catch and he lost possession of the ball when he hit the ground. The defender gained possession of it at that point. The defender is the one that completed the process of the catch, so the defender is awarded the ball.\"McDermott almost never calls out officials for a possible blown call, but he felt it was necessary in this case. \n\"I'm speaking up because I feel strongly that that was a catch and that possession should have been ball belongs to Buffalo,\" McDermott said. \"I can't agree with their assessment of a change of possession or whatever the statement was. I can't agree with that. We're not just going to sit here and take it, is what I'm saying. We're not just going to sit here and take it. I'm pissed off about it.\"The controversial interception was one of five turnovers by the Bills in the game. Allen was responsible for four of them with two interceptions and two lost fumbles. The pick by McMillian set up even more controversy: The Broncos ended up driving 75 yards for their game-winning field goal, but 47 yards of that total came on pass interference penalties. \nThe Bills have had to do deal with some painful losses in franchise history and this is another one that will certainly be sticking with them for awhile. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        For the seventh straight year, the Buffalo Bills reached the playoffs with Josh Allen, and for the seventh straight year, they didn't make it to the Super Bowl. The Bills are the Sisyphus of the NFL: They roll the boulder up the mountain every year and just as they're about to get to the top, it rolls right back down on them. But this year was supposed to be different. There was no Patrick Mahomes in the playoffs. Allen was the best quarterback in the 14-team postseason field, and if there was any season where he was going to be able to carry his team to the Super Bowl, this felt like the year it was going to happen. Allen put on his Superman cape, only to be stopped by a very unexpected form of Kryptonite: Himself. That's right: Josh Allen was his own worst enemy on Saturday. The Bills star quarterback played like he knew he had the weight of the world on him. Allen was trying to carry a Bills team that didn't have quite as much talent as its had over the past few years, and that weight proved to be too much. Allen turned the ball over four times in a 33-30 overtime loss to Denver and three of those turnovers came because he was trying to make something happen in a situation where he didn't need to do that.\n        \n            \n                Bo Nix injury: Broncos QB suffers season-ending ankle fracture in win over Bills; Jarrett Stidham to start\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLet's rewind to the end of the first half where Allen made what was easily the most inexcusable mistake of the game and possibly the most inexcusable mistake of his career. With just 16 seconds to go before halftime in a game Buffalo was trailing 17-10, the Bills decided they wanted to try and get some points. That decision turned into a disaster when Allen did this: \nThis was a mistake that was 100% on Allen. He was asking to be stripped on a play that just didn't need to happen. The Bills had no timeouts, so the half was going to end as soon as Allen was tackled. Instead, he fumbled the ball and it was recovered by the Broncos with two seconds left in the half. Denver ended up getting a field goal out of Allen's gaffe. Allen then opened the third quarter with another turnover on Buffalo's opening drive, but it's hard to blame this one on him. Broncos' star pass-rusher Nik Bonitto came in untouched from Allen's blindside and rocked him with a hit that caused a fumble. \nAfter turning the ball over twice, you'd think Allen would have been a little more protective with the football, but that wasn't the case. After the Bills defense picked off Bo Nix in the third quarter, the Buffalo offense was set up with good field position, but Allen threw that away with an interception that came on the second play after Buffalo got the ball back. \nThe Bills had the ball at Denver's 40 and were essentially already in field goal range when Allen's interception happened. After six years of playoff failures, you know that Allen was desperate to get to the AFC title game and it showed in overtime. On a third-and-11 play from his own 36-yard line, Allen went for the jugular and came up empty: He threw another interception. \nIf you watch the play, Cooks had several steps on his defender, but he had to slow up to try and make the catch. If he had come down with the ball, it would have been a spectacular catch, but instead, Ja'Quan McMillian made an even more spectacular interception. \nThere was some controversy involved on this play, because it looked like Brandin Cooks might have caught the ball and been down before Ja'Quan McMillian made the pick, but according to CBS Sports rules expert, Gene Steratore, the officials made the correct call on the field. \"I'm not sure that Cooks has possession coming to the ground,\" Steratore said.  \nAfter getting the interception, the Broncos drove 75 yards down the field for the game-winning field goal. \nWith his four turnovers, Allen became the first quarterback in 10 years to throw at least two interceptions while also losing at least two fumbles in a playoff game. The Broncos ended up getting nine points off of Allen's four turnovers, including the game-winning field goal from Wil Lutz. \"I feel like I let my teammates down tonight,\" an emotional Allen said after the game. \"Just missed opportunities throughout the game. It's been a long season. Hate how it ended. It's gonna stick with me for a long time.\"\nIt wasn't just the turnovers, though. Allen also missed several key throws, including one where he overthrew Dawson Knox on third down with under 20 seconds left to play that likely would have led to a game-winning touchdown. \nLet's be clear, Josh Allen is one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL. No one is disputing that. He had to deal with several big drops and the Bills wouldn't even have been in this game if not for Allen, who threw for 283 yards and three touchdowns to go along with his four turnovers. But on Saturday, Allen seemed to be playing with the weight of the world on his shoulders and that weight just got too heavy. The divisional round of the playoffs ended with a painful loss for a franchise that knows more about painful playoff losses than any other team in the NFL. For now, the Bills will continue to roll the boulder up the hill, but if it doesn't happen soon for Josh Allen, you certainly start to wonder if it ever will. \n            ",

    "body": "\nThe 2025 NFL playoffs are down to just eight teams as the divisional round takes place Saturday and Sunday. The Seattle Seahawks and Denver Broncos are back in action after a first-round bye last week, and each team faces a tough task as they host the San Francisco 49ers and Buffalo Bills, respectively. The Houston Texans head to New England for a date with the Patriots on Sunday after these teams knocked off the Pittsburgh Steelers and Los Angeles Chargers, respectively, and the weekend concludes with the Chicago Bears hosting the Los Angeles Rams after each team won a close one last week. Some teams are looking much better in the injury department than others entering the Divisional Round, so here, we break down the top injuries bettors should know before placing wagers, and also share the latest NFL betting odds from DraftKings Sportsbook. Buffalo Bills at Denver Broncos (4:30 p.m. ET, Saturday)BUFF LB Terrel Bernard (calf, out)BUFF DT Ed Oliver (biceps, will play)BUFF S Jordan Poyer (hamstring, out)BUFF CB Maxwell Hairston (ankle, out)BUFF RB Ty Johnson (ankle, out)BUFF WR Curtis Samuel (elbow, will play)BUFF WR Tyrell Shavers (knee, out)BUFF WR Gabe Davis (knee, out)\nIf you want to see the difference a first-round bye makes, look no further than this matchup. Buffalo is beat up on both sides of the ball, with linebacker Terrel Bernard and safety Jordan Poyer both out. Rookie cornerback Maxwell Hairston is also out. Offensively, receivers Tyrell Shavers and Gabe Davis each suffered torn ACLs last week, while No. 2 back Ty Johnson remains out of Buffalo's backfield. The Bills activated defensive tackle Ed Oliver and receiver Curtis Samuel from injured reserve, giving the team a boost on both sides of the ball. Both were officially questionable but will suit up in the Divisional Round.Denver is a 1.5-point favorite at home, and the total is 45.5.San Francisco 49ers at Seattle Seahawks (8 p.m. ET, Saturday)SF TE George Kittle (Achilles, out)SF WR Ricky Pearsall (knee, will play)SF Fred Warner (ankle, out)SEA QB Sam Darnold (oblique, will play)\nIt's always a concern when a player surprisingly pops up on the final injury report, and it's especially noteworthy when it's your starting quarterback. That's the case for Seattle's Sam Darnold as he popped up on Thursday's injury report with an oblique injury that resulted in a questionable designation for Saturday. Darnold is active, however, though reports stated he hadn't thrown a football since suffering the injury on Thursday. As for the 49ers, star tight end George Kittle is out for the rest of the postseason with a torn Achilles, veteran linebacker Fred Warner won't be activated and second-year receiver Ricky Pearsall is questionable due to a nagging knee injury.  Seattle is a 6.5-point favorite at home. The total is 43.5 after sitting at 45.5 for most of the week.Houston Texans at New England Patriots (3 p.m. ET, Sunday)HOU WR Nico Collins (concussion, out)NE CB Christian Gonzalez (concussion, will play)\nThe Texans' offense has been limited at times throughout the year, but it always had one constant in star receiver Nico Collins. That unit will not have Collins in this pivotal matchup with the Patriots, however, as he's out with a concussion he suffered in last week's win over the Steelers. With Collins out, Houston's more unproven receivers like Jayden Higgins and Jaylin Noel will have to step up as primary targets for C.J. Stroud. Making things harder is star cornerback Christian Gonzalez has cleared concussion protocol for New England and will play.The Patriots are 3-point favorites, and the total is 40.5 -- the lowest of this four-game slate.Los Angeles Rams at Chicago Bears (6:30 p.m. ET, Sunday)CHI WR Rome Odunze (foot, questionable)\nThe Rams are in a good spot when it comes to the health department, and the biggest injury news for the Bears is that second-year receiver Rome Odunze is questionable with a foot injury that cost him considerable time this year. Odunze played last week and told reporters he expects to suit up against the Rams.The Rams are 3.5-point road favorites. The total is 45.5.\n            ",

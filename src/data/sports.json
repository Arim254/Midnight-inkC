    "body": "\n        The New York Knicks look to continue their home supremacy when they battle the Cleveland Cavaliers in an Eastern Conference matchup on the 2025 NBA Christmas Day schedule. Cleveland is coming off a 141-118 win over New Orleans on Tuesday, while New  York dropped a 115-104 decision at Minnesota that same night. The Cavaliers (17-14), who are second in the Central Division, are 6-6 on the road this season. The Knicks (20-9), who are first in the Atlantic Division, are 14-2 on their home court.

    "body": "\n        Eleven 2025-26 college football bowl games and four playoff matchup are in the books, but some bowl confidence pools remain open for entries or modifications as there are around 30 matchups remaining to make college football bowl picks on before the curtain closes on this season. The biggest remaining college football spread has Utah as a 15.5-point favorite over Nebraska in the Las Vegas Bowl on Wednesday, Dec. 31 as Kyle Whittingham will coach his final game for the Utes. While putting faith in big favorites is a part of just about everyone's college football bowl confidence strategy, correctly predicting a couple upsets can give you a big edge in any football pools. Anticipated matchups outside of the CFP include Penn State vs. Clemson (-3), Vanderbilt (-5.5) vs. Iowa, Georgia Tech vs. BYU (-4), Tennessee vs. Illinois (+2.5) and Michigan vs. Texas (-7.5). Before making any college football predictions for bowl season, be sure to see the latest college football bowl confidence picks from SportsLine's proven model.New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $75 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times, and it is 31-19 on its top-rated college football money-line picks since the beginning of the 2024 season. Now, it has turned its attention to the latest college football odds and 2025-26 bowl season college football betting for confidence pools. Head here to see every pick. New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Top 2025-26 college football bowl confidence picks  One of the model's most confident picks is that No. 16 USC (-6.5), who will have quarterback Jayden Maiava, gets a comfortable win over TCU in the Alamo Bowl on Dec. 30. USC went 9-3 in the regular season, with all three defeats coming versus ranked teams. TCU found itself in the Top 25 once -- back in September -- before having a pedestrian run through the Big 12 schedule, finishing 5-4. Even with the Horned Frogs playing in the easier conference than the Trojans, USC both averaged more points and allowed fewer points per game. USC sports a 32-9 (78%) straight-up record when favored since Lincoln Riley came aboard in 2022, as it is projected to easily take care of business in San Antonio. SportsLine's model has the Trojans prevailing 70% of the time. See all of the model's college football bowl confidence picks here.Another one of the bowl confidence predictions the model is high on: Northwestern (-10.5) handles Central Michigan in the GameAbove Sports Bowl on Dec. 26. Central Michigan struggled mightily against Power 4 opponents this year, losing 63-3 to Michigan and 45-17 to Pittsburgh. Northwestern went just 6-6 this year, but that was largely thanks to a very tough Big Ten schedule that included Oregon, Michigan, USC and Illinois. For comparison, Northwestern lost to Michigan by two points on a last-second field goal. The model has Northwestern winning nearly 80% of the time, making the Wildcats the clear side to back. See the rest of the college football bowl confidence predictions here. How to make college football bowl confidence picksThe model has also made the call on who wins every other bowl game. There are several teams that win at least 70% of the time, so you need to go big on those matchups, as well as plenty of underdogs that win outright. You can get all the model's picks at SportsLine.So who wins every college football bowl game, and which matchups should you assign the most confidence points to?

    "body": "\n        It's that time of year, when Santa Claus makes dreams come true for kids across the world. What if he came to college basketball bearing gifts? What would he bring?The wish list is long for players, coaches, teams and leagues around the sport. With nonconference play wrapping up for most programs, needs are more obvious now than they were before the season. If expectations are going to be met or surpassed, a visit from college basketball's Santa Claus would be ideal for almost everyone. While no such gift-bearing phenomenon exists, we are getting in the holiday spirt for this week's Dribble Handoff. These are the gifts we would give if we could play the role of college basketball's Santa Claus.For St. John's: A point guard Unless things dramatically turn around and culminate with a deep run through the bracket of the 2026 NCAA Tournament, this season at St. John's will forever be remembered as the one that started with Rick Pitino calling Ian Jackson the Red Storm's \"next great point\" but quickly turned into something that had the Hall of Fame coach lamenting the idea that nobody on his roster qualifies as a true high-major point guard.\nIt's not ideal!Can St. John's still be good without a legitimate high-major lead-guard? Sure, I guess. The Red Storm are still 20th at BartTorvik.com and KenPom.com -- and 26th in the Top 25 And 1. They're not bad. They're just not ... great. And unfortunately for anybody who might've had them No. 1 in the preseason, it appears likely that they'll always fall something short of great because of some combination of recruiting failures and miscalculations that have left one of the sport's most talented rosters with a gaping hole. -- Gary ParrishFor Mick Cronin: Cozy clothes, sleeping pills and an airplane pillowMy colleagues are trying to gift out individual things to teams increase their chances of winning over the next three months. But I am looking at the calendar and trying to be more practical. There's an urgent matter just over the horizon that needs immediate attention.A year ago, UCLA coach Mick Cronin was furious at the sight of the Statue of Liberty and the state of the Bruins' travel schedule. He was so miffed by the team's travel arrangements, he made sure of two things last offseason: he would quietly sign a big new contract, and he his team did not leave the state of California for any of its nonconference games this November and December. But Big Ten play starts in earnest the next in less than two weeks, and I have some tough news for Cronin — It's time to hit the road\nJan. 3: @ IowaJan. 6: @ WisconsinJan. 10: vs. MarylandJan. 14: @ Penn StateJan. 17: @ Ohio StateThe 10-3 Bruins have four of their first five games of 2026 not only on the road, but two or three time zones away. The brunt of UCLA's Big Ten travel is early, which is probably preferred, but Cronin's capacity to go viral with a postgame rant is all the more probable thanks to this unforgiving start to January. The team may well lose three of its first five games after the New Year. That in mind, Cronin needs some Lululemon, travel slippers, sleeping medication for the long flights, a high-end pillow to help catch some Zs and a few podcasts to pass the time/reduce his anxiety. Obviously, Eye on College Basketball should be the go-to, but if he's looking for something outside of sports, SmartLess and Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend are as enjoyable as non-sports pods get. -- Matt NorlanderFor Illinois: A playmaking defender Illinois is scoring 127.5 points per 100 possessions, per KenPom data. That's a mark ranked second nationally in adjusted efficiency margin per the website. That's elite. They are picking teams apart by taking care of the ball, shooting it efficiently and smashing teams on the offensive glass. What's not elite for the Illini, and largely why there are 9-3 instead of 12-0: their defense.\nThey are surrendering 98.1 points per 100 possessions -- a number ranked 27th nationally in adjusted efficiency. That's perfectly fine and could get Illinois to 25 wins with ease. But it is nowhere close to elite. (Michigan, for comparison, is first, surrendering just 88.2 points per 100 possessions.)They are dead last among major conference teams in steal rate defensively and in turnover rate forced. (And, for what it's worth, this is a theme under Brad Underwood going back several years.) They don't generate enough chaos to create transition opportunities -- an area that, per Synergy data, Illinois rates in the 92nd percentile in nationally. Let's give the Illini a defensive playmaker or two and just see what happens. If this team was even at the Div. I average in steal rate or turnover rate defensively they could level up to a juggernaut potentially with the way their offense is humming. That's not the case. And it may be the one area I would pinpoint that ultimately keeps this team as a No. 3 or 4 seed in the NCAA Tournament as opposed to a No. 1 or 2 seed. It's areas on the margin holding Illinois back that separates Illinois from just a good defense to a truly great one. -- Kyle Boone\nFor Kentucky: Magic shoulder creamIf Kentucky could just have a healthy and available Lowe, it would alleviate many of its problems. With frontcourt players Mo Dioubate and Jayden Quaintance back in the rotation after working back from injuries of their own, a clean bill of health for Lowe is the final missing piece. That's why I'm getting the Wildcats some magic shoulder cream that fixes all shoulder issues for point guards. It's the second year in a row UK is grappling with this problem. Last year, it was Lamont Butler, who soldiered through shoulder issues that required him to wear a bulky brace. This year, Lowe has played in just six of UK's 13 games while navigating a problematic shoulder situation of his own.Lowe is the Wildcats' most impactful offensive player, according to EvanMiya.com's BPR metric, because he's the straw that stirs the drink. He's this roster's one true point guard, and life without him makes for some ugly offense. --David Cobb\nFor Vermont and Mercyhurst: A jump-ball victoryAccording to KenPom's glorious database, there are only two teams that have not won the opening tip against a fellow Division I club. Vermont and Mercyhurst. The basketball gods have to rectify this. Vermont is particularly confusing. John Becker has trotted out three different players to try and win the jump to no avail. Gus Yalden (0-1), Ben Michaels (0-2) and Noah Barnett (0-10) have all whiffed.Oh, and the jump ball isn't nothing. Models predict that winning the jump ball increases your chance of winning the game by 3%. Even with the opening-tip follies, Vermont is still projected to be the kings of the America East. Mercyhurst very likely won't win the NEC, but it will have that early-November victory over Loyola-Chicago on the ledger forever. -- Isaac TrotterFor Kansas: A healthy Darryn PetersonThere were not many players in college basketball (in recent memory) who arrived with more hype entering the season than Peterson. The projected No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NBA Draft is one of the best guard prospects of this generation and is an elite scorer. Simply put, it's been a shame Peterson hasn't been able to play more because I think people are forgetting how good he is. Peterson has only appeared in four games this season. For Kansas to be the best version of itself down the stretch, it's going to need him to be healthy.\nThat's why, for Christmas, I'm giving Peterson a fresh bill of health. College basketball fans deserve to watch one of the best players in the sport play more. Kansas coach Bill Self already said this week that it's a mutual agreement between Kansas and the Peterson family to hold him out until he's at full strength. -- Cameron Salerno\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Week 17 is the championship matchup in a vast majority of Fantasy football leagues, so it's the biggest week for Fantasy lineup decisions of the year for those who have made it thus far. In 2024, the players who had starred all year also showed up in the penultimate week as Joe Burrow, Saquon Barkley, Derrick Henry and Trey McBride were among the stats leaders. This year, it's the likes of Josh Allen, Jonathan Taylor and Puka Nacua who have excelled and remain must-starts as Week 17 Fantasy football picks.As for your Fantasy football start/sit decisions, targeting players on teams with something to play for that are facing teams out of playoff contention could be the way to go. So, the likes of Jaylen Warren, Baker Mayfield, Bucky Irving and Stefon Diggs may find themselves a bit higher in the Week 17 Fantasy football projections than expected. Some NFL injuries of note to consider for Fantasy include J.J. McCarthy (hand) being out and Lamar Jackson (back) and Jordan Love (concussion/shoulder) being day to day.Before setting your Week 17 Fantasy football lineups for championship matchups, be sure to check out the Week 17 Fantasy football rankings from the proven computer model at SportsLine. Bet on every NFL Week 17 game at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your $5 initial wager wins:When it comes to ranking players, SportsLine's model beat human experts in Fantasy football for the past several seasons, especially when there were big differences in ranking.

Thomas, who is owned in almost all leagues being started in nearly half of them, has been a top-25 Fantasy receiver over the last three weeks, but this has been his best stretch all season as inconsistency has defined his sophomore year. He had a season-low of 18 yards last week, as both Parker Washington and Jakobi Meyers have passed Thomas in the eyes of Trevor Lawrence, as those two are averaging more receptions and yards over the last month. Thomas may not warrant a spot in Week 17 Fantasy football lineups as he sits outside the top 30 in wide receiver rankings.Another curveball: The model is high on Rams tight end Colby Parkinson, despite him being the TE22 on the season and being started in just 38% of leagues this week. Parkinson has quietly performed as the TE6 since Week 10 as he's made the most of Tyler Higbee going on injured reserve. The former has six touchdowns over his last seven games while averaging 35.9 receiving yards over this stretch. He should continue that success on Monday night versus a Falcons defense which just allowed 11 catches and 118 yards to the tight end position on Sunday, which came a week after giving up a tight end touchdown.

    "body": "\n        We got an early Christmas gift last week, as I enjoyed one of my most successful betting weeks of the season. For the Week 16 slate, I correctly picked 12 of the 16 games on the moneyline and was 10-5-1 ATS overall. That included a 4-1 ATS mark within my five locks of the week, with my lone loss coming via the Denver Broncos falling to the Jacksonville Jaguars. That'll certainly have us rocking around the Christmas tree and having a few extra celebratory eggnogs.As I now try to keep this momentum rolling through the holiday slate, injuries are going to make Week 17 a little tricky, as a number of injured quarterbacks are dampening the overall crop of games. In part because of those injuries, I found myself leaning on favorites for the majority of this slate, as I'm taking just five underdogs to cover and only three of them to pull off outright upsets.All odds via DraftKings Sportsbook.2025 recordLocks of the Week ATS: 42-38-0ATS: 106-132-2ML: 150-89-1Denver Broncos at Kansas City ChiefsThursday, 8:15 p.m. ET (Prime Video)\nThe Broncos saw their 11-game winning streak snapped last week in a rather surprising loss at home to the Jaguars. The defense allowed 34 points, the most it has given up this season. The loss also kept the door ajar for their AFC rivals, the Chargers, to potentially leapfrog them in the standings for the No. 1 seed. But while a little air has come out of the balloon, it hasn't popped, and I have a hard time seeing the Broncos struggle in this Christmas Day matchup.The Chiefs already lost Patrick Mahomes (ACL) for the season, and now top backup Gardner Minshew is on injured reserve with a knee injury. That'll thrust Chris Oladokun in at quarterback. The former seventh-round pick in 2022 has spent the last four seasons on Kansas City's practice squad, so he does have familiarity with the offense, but he could be walking into a buzzsaw.\nI expect this Denver defense to make a statement after its worst outing of the season, and Oladokun could be on the receiving end of that, especially with a less-than-stellar offensive line in front of him.Projected score: Broncos 27, Chiefs 10The pick: Broncos -12.5Philadelphia Eagles at Buffalo BillsSunday, 4:25 p.m. ET (Fox | Fubo, try for free)\nThe Bills defense has me worried about its ability to go far in the postseason. They haven't paid for it yet, as they are 4-0 when they give up 31 points or more this season, but that's not sustainable, especially against a team like Philadelphia. This could specifically be a game where Saquon Barkley explodes, continuing his late-season resurgence that includes rushing for at least 120 yards in two of his past three games. Buffalo is giving up 5.4 yards per carry this season, which ranks as the second-highest mark in the NFL and trails only the Giants (5.5 yards per carry). For reference, the last time Barkley faced New York, he posted 150 yards on just 13 carries in Week 8. \nWhen you pair that mismatch with an improved Jalen Hurts (five touchdowns and zero interceptions over his last two games), Philly should have little problem moving the football. While Josh Allen and James Cook form one of the best one-two punches in the league, the Eagles defense allows just 5.0 yards per play this season, which ties for the fifth-lowest mark in the NFL. This smells like an upset.Projected score: Eagles 27, Bills 24The pick: Eagles +2Arizona Cardinals at Cincinnati BengalsSunday, 1 p.m. ET (Fox | Fubo, try for free)\nThe Bengals offense is finally looking like the unit we expected now that it is fully healthy, and it is coming off a Week 16 win over the Dolphins, where it dropped a season-high 45 points. Now, they take on an Arizona team that has lost seven straight entering Week 17 and is allowing 31.8 points per game since Week 6, the highest mark in the NFL over that span. This sets the stage for another high-flying day of offense for Joe Burrow's unit. Even when you account for the shutout loss to the Ravens in Week 15, Cincinnati is averaging 27.7 points per game since Burrow returned from injury in Week 13. \nAs always with the Bengals, the concern isn't whether they can score; it's whether the defense can fend off the opponent enough to pull out the win. Against this Cardinals team, I expect it to hold up its end of the bargain. Over the last three games, the Cardinals offense has averaged just 18.7 points per game. Even if Cincinnati's defense gives up a tick more than that average, the offense is potent enough to pull out the win and cover the spread.Projected score: Bengals 33, Cardinals 23The pick: Bengals -7Jacksonville Jaguars at Indianapolis ColtsSunday, 1 p.m. ET (Fox | Fubo, try for free)\nHand up, I did not think the Jaguars were capable of going into Denver and beating the Broncos. Throughout the season, I've been skeptical about how high Jacksonville's ceiling really is, but it has proven me wrong time and time again. No more. I'm looking at them as a serious player in the AFC and treating them like one of the conference's elite clubs. If they can go to Mile High and win, they are more than capable of pulling out a victory at Lucas Oil Stadium by more than a touchdown. Over his past six games, Trevor Lawrence is averaging 8.4 yards per attempt, has 19 total touchdowns and a passer rating of 108.7. All of those are the highest marks in the NFL over that stretch. Lawrence should be able to outduel Philip Rivers, who will be playing on a short week.\nProjected score: Jaguars 27, Colts 20The pick: Jaguars -6.5New Orleans Saints at Tennessee TitansSunday, 1 p.m. ET (CBS | Paramount+)\nI wrote about it on Monday in my weekly Cover 32 column, but it's worth pointing out again: Cam Ward is enjoying a full-fledged breakout. Over his last three games, he's 2-1 and has Tennessee averaging 27 points per game, while he's totaled six touchdowns and just one turnover, giving him a 97.9 passer rating. While Tyler Shough has been good himself, I think Ward will have a more balanced point of attack in this game. New Orleans' backfield is so banged up that Taysom Hill led the team with 12 rushing attempts last week, and the team as a whole dropped back to pass 50 times. That's too lopsided and creates a one-dimensional offense that is much easier to slow down. On the Tennessee side, Tony Pollard has rushed for at least 100 yards in three straight games, and Ward is getting serviceable contributions from his pass catchers like Chig Okonkwo, Tyjae Spears, and Elic Ayomannor. The Titans are live dogs.Projected score: Titans 23, Saints 21The pick: Titans +2.5Rest of the bunchCowboys at Commanders (Thursday)Projected score: Cowboys 30, Commanders 20The pick: Cowboys -7\nLions at Vikings (Thursday)Projected score: Lions 28, Vikings 17The pick: Lions -7.5Texans at Chargers (Saturday)Projected score: Texans 23, Chargers 21The pick: Texans +2.5Ravens at Packers (Saturday)Projected score: Packers 24, Ravens 20The pick: Packers -2.5\nPatriots at JetsProjected score: Patriots 30, Jets 17The pick: Patriots -12.5Steelers at BrownsProjected score: Steelers 23, Browns 20The pick: Browns +3.5Seahawks at PanthersProjected score: Seahawks 28, Panthers 21The pick: Panthers +7.5Buccaneers at DolphinsProjected score: Buccaneers 27, Dolphins 20The pick: Buccaneers -5.5Giants at RaidersProjected score: Raiders 23, Giants 17The pick: Raiders -1.5Bears at 49ers Projected score: 49ers 30, Bears 24The pick: 49ers -3Rams at Falcons (Monday)Projected score: Rams 30, Falcons 20The pick: Rams -8.5\n            ",

Pittsburgh has rolled off three straight wins -- and three straight covers -- to control its own destiny to claim the AFC North. Meanwhile, Cleveland fought valiantly in its loss to the Bills on Sunday, but the Browns are now 0-4 straight-up and 1-3 ATS over the last month. Shedeur Sanders has brought excitement to the Browns but not necessarily many winning plays as no player has more turnovers (seven) than Sanders since he became starter in Week 12. Pittsburgh capitalizes off taking the ball away as the Steelers have covered in six straight games this season when winning the turnover battle. The model has Pittsburgh prevailing versus the spread nearly 60% of the time. See which other teams to pick here, and bet the Steelers using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nAnother one of its Week 17 NFL predictions: the Bengals (-7, 53.5) cover against the Cardinals in a 1 p.m. ET kick on Sunday. Both teams are out of the playoff picture, but Cincinnati is in much better form overall. The Bengals have won two of their past four and have covered in four of their past five. The Cardinals, meanwhile, have dropped seven straight and are just 1-6 against the spread during that span. In addition to backing the Broncos, the model also says the Over hits nearly 60% of the time. See which other teams to pick here, and bet the Bengals to cover at DraftKings:\nHow to make Week 17 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 17 NFL schedule and just revealed seven teams that outright win nearly 70% of the time, or more, potentially giving you a huge payday.

The Nittany Lions cover well over 60% of the time, while the model also says the Under hits in almost 60% of simulations. See which other picks the model likes here.\nAnother prediction: Missouri (-4, 44.5) covers versus No. 20 Virginia in the Gator Bowl on Dec. 27 in almost 60% of simulations. UVA is coming off an ACC Title Game loss to Duke, in which the Cavaliers would have made the CFP if they had won. Thus, you have to wonder about motivation now that they have to settle for a lesser bowl game, and Virginia has struggled in bowls to begin with, going 1-4 over the last 19 years. Mizzou has won back-to-back bowls under Eli Drinkwitz, and the Tigers' only losses this season came versus teams ranked in the top 10 of the AP Poll at the time. Missouri is 4-1 ATS at neutral sites since Drinkwitz took over in 2020, and the Tigers are 12-4 ATS as favorites since the start of last season. See the rest of the model's picks here.How to make college football picks for bowl seasonThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every 2025-26 college football bowl game, and it's calling for five underdogs to outright win in bowl matchups of power conference teams. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine, and for a limited time you can use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1.So what college football picks can you make with confidence, and which five underdogs are projected to win outright?

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Imagn Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The second matchup of the NBA Christmas schedule is one that is growing increasingly familiar for fans. The San Antonio Spurs and Oklahoma City Thunder played perhaps the game of the year in the NBA Cup semifinals. They played again on Tuesday, just two days before Christmas. The Spurs won both games, handing the Thunder (26-4) half of their losses to this point in the season. Now they'll square off for the third time this month on Christmas itself.Somehow, I doubt any fans are complaining. The Thunder and Spurs represent what most expect to be the defining rivalry of this era of NBA history. Oklahoma City already has a championship to its name along with one of the deepest rosters in NBA history. Victor Wembanyama represents arguably the greatest threat to their impending dynasty in the NBA as an impossibly skilled giant with a seeming distaste for Thunder big man Chet Holmgren.So how are we gearing up for Thunder-Spurs Round 3? With best bets, of course. Below is our pick against the spread plus a prop bet headed into what might be the day's marquee game.\n        \n            \n                Bold predictions for each NBA Christmas Day game: Thunder-Spurs tension, a Curry flurry and more\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSpurs at Thunder: Where to watchTime: 2:30 p.m. ET | Date: Thursday, Dec. 25Location: Paycom Center -- Oklahoma CityTV channel: ABC/ESPN | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)Odds: Thunder -9.5, O/U: 235.5 (via Caesars Sportsbook) Spurs at Thunder: Odds, prediction, best bets\nLook, we're basing this off of vibes. Oklahoma City's first loss to San Antonio was a close, marquee game. Their second turned into a blowout in the fourth quarter. For the first time in the Thunder's young run, people are starting to wonder if a team has their number. Wembanyama's disdain for Holmgren should only intensify Oklahoma City's resolve. Expect the Thunder to come out motivated on Christmas, and as big as this line looks, remember, the Thunder have played 14 games in Oklahoma City this season and haven't lost one of them. In fact, they only have one single-digit home victory, which came on Oct. 28 against the Kings. The Thunder blow everyone out in their building. This should be no exception. The Pick: Thunder -9.5\nWe're sticking with the motivational theme for our prop pick. Chet Holmgren scored only seven points in Tuesday's loss to the Spurs, but it's worth noting that he scored 17 in the NBA Cup loss and had reached this over in seven of the nine previous games that he played. He's gonna go at Wembanyama on Christmas in an effort to prove that there is in fact a rivalry between the two of them. The Pick: Holmgren Over 15.5 Points\n            \n    ",

They played each other on Christmas as members of the Heat and Thunder. They did so again when James moved to the Cavaliers and Durant joined the Warriors. When James flew West for Hollywood, he faced Durant's Warriors in yet another holiday showdown. Were it not for an injury, Durant would have joined his Nets against the Lakers in 2021. Now, we're here again. The Lakers and Rockets represent the fifth unique matchup of their teams on Christmas Day.Well... \"their\" teams isn't quite the descriptor it used to be. While James and Durant are still stars, they are now supported but younger marquee players. This isn't just James vs. Durant. It's Luka Dončić vs. Alperen Sengun. It's Austin Reaves vs. Amen Thompson. It's two of the Western Conference elite slugging it out with major playoff standing implications at stake.So let's prepare for one of the best games on the Christmas slate with some best bets. Below are our picks against the spread and for the game's best prop bet.\n        \n            \n                Bold predictions for each NBA Christmas Day game: Thunder-Spurs tension, a Curry flurry and more\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nRockets at Lakers: Where to watchTime: 8 p.m. ET | Date: Thursday, Dec. 25Location: Crypto.com Arena -- Los AngelesTV channel: ABC/ESPN | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)Odds: Rockets -3, O/U: 230.5 (via Caesars Sportsbook) Rockets at Lakers: Prediction, odds, best bets\nThe Lakers are very banged up right now. Luka Dončić missed Tuesday's game. DeAndre Ayton just came back from a brief injury absence. So did Austin Reaves, and LeBron James is nearly 41, so it's safe to assume he's never quite at 100% anymore. That's exactly where you don't want to be heading into a matchup against the ultra-physical Rockets. The Lakers have had trouble with bigger, athletic teams all season. That's their weakness. Until they prove that they can overcome it, I'm expecting the Rockets to bully them in this one. The Pick: Rockets -3\nThe Lakers have holes all over their defense, but nowhere is it more glaring than in the backcourt. They are incredibly vulnerable against smaller, fast guards, and only the Clippers and Jazz are allowing a higher 3-point percentage on above-the-break 3s. In other words, I'm expecting the Lakers to build their game-plan around stopping the Rockets in the paint, and in the process Reed Sheppard will have a field day from deep. The Pick: Reed Sheppard Over 2.5 3s\n            \n    ",

The Minnesota Timberwolves and Denver Nuggets were built by the same general manager, Tim Connelly. They faced off in the 2024 playoffs, where Minnesota ended Denver's championship defense with a second-round upset. Every year, they seem to play in a thriller or two. Last year, the Timberwolves stole a double overtime victory on a terrible Russell Westbrook shooting foul.Neither team is quite at its peak. Denver is still dealing with injuries to Aaron Gordon and Christian Braun. Minnesota is still adjusting to life without Nickeil Alexander-Walker. But these are still both Western Conference contenders, and any game between the two of them is a deserving marquee regular-season event. Below is our pick against the spread as well as the best prop bet for the Christmas finale.\n        \n            \n                Bold predictions for each NBA Christmas Day game: Thunder-Spurs tension, a Curry flurry and more\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTimberwolves at Nuggets: Where to watchTime: 10:30 p.m. ET | Date: Thursday, Dec. 25Location: Ball Arena -- DenverTV channel: ABC/ESPN | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)Odds: Nuggets -3.5, O/U: 238.5 (via BetMGM) Timberwolves at Nuggets: Prediction, odds, best bets\nDenver's depth has improved significantly this season, but the injuries are just becoming too much to overcome against a great opponent like Minnesota. Aaron Gordon and Christian Braun are still out, and on Tuesday, Cam Johnson suffered a knee injury that we don't know the extent of yet, but should leave Denver without a third starter for at least some period of time. The Timberwolves always get up for Nuggets games and they've now won 10 of their last 12, including statement wins over the Knicks and Thunder. They're the safer pick with the points. The Pick: Timberwolves +3.5\nI'll admit my instinct was to pick Nikola Jokić's scoring over to account for his missing teammates, but no team limits his shot total better than Minnesota. Outside of his 61-point gem last season, which came without Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr. and took two overtimes, Jokić has averaged just 15.4 shot attempts per game against Minnesota over the past two regular seasons. So I'm going the other way and expecting a more balanced offensive night for the three-time MVP. The Pick: Jokić Under 29.5 Points\n            \n    ",

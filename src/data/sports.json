It's been a rousing success thus far. The Americans routed Italy, 6-0, in their quarterfinal matchup on Friday to advance to the medal round.The Americans only led 1-0 after the first period due in large part to the spectacular efforts of Italy goaltender Gabriella Durante. However, the U.S. eventually solved Durante and hung five goals in the second period to coast to a blowout victory in the knockout round.Defender Megan Keller got on the board first, but it was Kendall Coyne Schofield who got the ball rolling for Team USA. She had two goals in the first few minutes of the middle frame -- her first two goals of the tournament -- and those set the tone for the rest of the game. Caroline Harvey tacked on another assist, giving her eight points and the U.S. women's record for the most points in a single Olympics for a defender. Harvey's fellow Wisconsin defender, Laila Edwards, also shined with one goal and one assist.\nTeam USA has now outscored its opponents 26-1 in these Olympics, and it outshot the Italians 51-6 in this game. The Americans have faced little resistance so far, but perhaps that will change in the semifinal game on Monday against Sweden, who advanced by upsetting Czechia 2-0 on Friday.Below is everything you need to know about how to watch Team USA's semifinal clash with Sweden, as well as how they got here.U.S. women's hockey Olympic scheduleAll times EasternPreliminary roundThursday, Feb. 5: USA 5, Czechia 1 Saturday, Feb. 7: USA 5, Finland 0Monday, Feb. 9: USA 5, Switzerland 0Tuesday, Feb. 10: USA 5, Canada 0QuarterfinalFriday, Feb. 13: USA 6, Italy 0SemifinalUSA vs. Sweden | Monday, Feb. 16 | 10:40 a.m. | TBDBronze medal game\nTBD vs. TBD | Thursday, Feb. 19 | 8:40 a.m. | TBDGold medal gameTBD vs. TBD | Thursday, Feb. 19 | 1:10 p.m. | TBD\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

In the semifinals, which also took place Saturday, she fell behind Kelsey Plum 8-0, before going on a 12-0 run to end the game. Gray then lost the first game of the finals, and trailed in each of the last two games.

The Friars' Duncan Powell sparked the scuffle between Big East rivals when he committed a hard foul early in the second half   on St. John's forward Bryce Hopkins, who played at Providence from 2022-25 before transferring to the Red Storm. \nPowell, who was assessed a Flagrant-2 for the foul, and Hopkins immediately went after each other, which caused players from both benches to spill out onto the court. It took officials and security guards almost a minute to break up the ensuing scrum. Officials also paused play for 19 minutes so that they could review footage and issue appropriate punishment. St. John's coach Rick Pitino, who coached at Providence from 1985-87, also entered the play area in an attempt to remove his players from the situation. Powell was one of two Providence players ejected alongside leading scorer Jaylin Sellers, who immediately joined Powell in shoving St. John's players. Officials ejected St. John's forward Dillon Mitchell for his initial involvement in the scrap. Red Storm bench players Kelvin Odih, Ruben Prey and Lefteris Liotopoulos were all tossed for leaving the St. John's bench area. Hopkins shot two free throws for the initial foul and St. John's guard Oziyah Sellers shot free throws for the technical foul assessed on Providence's Sellers. Oziyah Sellers then scored to expand the St. John's lead to 44-40 with just over 14 minutes to play in the second half. \nPowell will also be suspended for Providence's next game against DePaul since he was ejected for fighting after the Flagrant-2.   The end of the fight caused further tempers to flare. Later in the second half, Providence forward Jameir Jones was immediately ejected after he pushed Hopkins while Hopkins was driving to the basket. Jones did not attempt to play the ball. Players from both sides jawed at each other following Jones' shove and subsequent ejection, but another scuffle was avoided. \nAfter the game Pitino avoided comment on the incident.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Florida's bid for a national title repeat is nearing full stride after Saturday's 92-83 win over No. 25 Kentucky, and the No. 14 Gators have a new piece of hardware firmly in their sights as well.A year after Auburn edged the Gators by a game for the SEC regular-season crown, Florida is in the driver's seat of the league standings with six games left. Since starting league play 0-1 with a 76-74 loss at Missouri on Jan. 3, the Gators are 10-1. In that span, they've rated as the second-most efficient team in college basketball behind only Houston, according to barttorvik.com.That efficiency was on display again against a Kentucky (17-7, 8-4) team that had won eight of its past nine games. Florida employed its typical crush of offensive rebounding to establish the tone and then used some perimeter marksmanship to keep the resilient Wildcats at arm's length.\nUrban Klavzar hit 5-of-11 attempts from beyond the arc, tying a season-high for makes and marking his eighth game of 3+ makes from 3-point range this season. The only thing standing between Kentucky and a potential 13-0 run late in the second half was a pair of Klavzar triples at 5:18 and 3:07 marks that subdued Kentucky's effort to rally from a 16-point deficit.\nKlavzar's perimeter acumen as the team's top guard option off the bench has rarely been in question. The Gators have simply needed more of that firepower from within their starting lineup.Xaivian Lee provided it against Kentucky. The Princeton transfer led all scorers with 22 points, shooting a refreshing 4 of 7 from deep in a demonstration of the potential the Gators saw when they recruited the former two-time all-Ivy League performer.\nFlorida's 3-point shooting is improvingFlorida entered ranked 354th nationally in 3-point percentage at 29.2% and making just 7.4 long-range shots per game. Last year, the Gators made 9.8 per game while shooting 35.6%, which was 87th nationally. That's a big difference.While some downtick in 3-point shooting was likely unavoidable amid the departures of star guards Walter Clayton Jr., Alijah Martin and Will Richard, the slide has been more intense than expected.Lee entered shooting just 25.5% from deep on six attempts per game after shooting 36.6% from deep for Princeton last season. Florida's other starting guard, Boogie Fland, entered with one 3-point make in his last seven games and went 0 for 3 against Kentucky.\nHow a team this bad at shooting has managed to be so good anyway is a remarkable testament to Florida's convoy of quality bigs and the rising stardom of versatile forward Thomas Haugh, who has been flexed down to the small forward position this season. That move hasn't helped Florida's perimeter shooting, but it has only made them meaner defensively and tougher to handle on the glass.\nWhen the Gators do get hot from deep like they did against Kentucky? Watch out. That's when a great team starts to like an elite team that can win it all. Florida is now 9-0 when making nine or more 3-pointers after finishing 10 of 28 against Kentucky.Florida in good position in SEC raceThe Gators now have at least a two-game edge in the loss column on everyone in the SEC standings except for Arkansas. The Razorbacks entered their Saturday game with Auburn at 8-3 in the league. Florida will host Arkansas on Feb. 28 in a game that could have SEC title ramifications.\nIt's also possible that the Gators will have separated even further from the pack by then. Their next two games are against lower-tier foes South Carolina and Ole Miss before a manageable trip to Texas on Feb. 25.A return trip to face Kentucky inside Rupp Arena on March 7 also looms at the end of the schedule. But at this rate, Florida may have the league title locked up by the time it returns to the scene of last year's thrilling 106-100 loss to the Wildcats.\n            ",

A cause of death was not released, though the UNI officials confirmed to the Des Moines Register that Cedar Falls Fire and Rescue had responded to an athletic facility on Thursday. A call log for the department shows a response at 7:15 a.m. for a report of a non-traumatic unconscious or fainting person at the UNI Dome.Sutherland, an Iowa City native, appeared in four games for the Panthers during the 2025 season.\"I'm heartbroken,\" UNI coach Todd Stepsis said in a release. \"No words can express my condolences to Adam, Jill and Georgia (his parents and sister). Parker embodied everything we look for in a UNI football Panther. His talent and potential excited us on a daily basis, but it failed to compare to the type of person and teammate he was. His character, humility, toughness and genuine love of others are what champions are made of. While I'm saddened that our time together was short, we will celebrate the bright light that he brought to our football team for the rest of our lives.\"\nSutherland was a second-team all-state selection as a senior at Iowa City High School in 2024. He also played basketball and baseball.\"It is a heartbreaking day for our Panther Athletics family with the passing of our Parker Sutherland,\" UNI athletics director Megan Franklin said in a release. \"We are devastated -- just devastated. The blessing is that we have a Panther family who will hold the Sutherland family, our football team and our athletics staff close as we grieve.\"UNI is scheduled to start the 2026 season at Eastern Washington on Sept. 5.\n            \n    ",

Sac State will serve as a replacement for Northern Illinois in the MAC. The Huskies will officially depart for the Mountain West as a football-only member this summer. According to ESPN, Sac State's cost of entry is expected to be around $18 million.Sac State has not released its 2026 football schedule, but multiple programs have announced games against the Hornets including Tarleton State, Maine and North Alabama.

After that waiver was denied by the NCAA, the school competed for one final football season in the Big Sky, finishing 7-5 overall with a 5-3 conference mark.Meanwhile, school president Luke Wood and athletic director Mark Orr went back to the drawing board, with the MAC mebership emerging as the most logical path to the FBS. The Hornets have also been preparing on the NIL front, with a budget \"north of $1 million,\" a source told CBS Sports. \nThe school hired Arizona assistant Alonzo Carter on Dec. 15 after former coach Brennan Marion departed to join Deion Sanders' Colorado staff as offensive coordinator. Carter is a first-time head coach who has spent the last eight seasons working under Brent Brennan at both San Jose State and Arizona. He has deep recruiting ties to California after starting his career as a high school coach in the state.\"We are thrilled to welcome Alonzo Carter as our next head football coach,\" Orr said in a statement released by the school. \"Coach Carter is a proven leader who has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to developing student-athletes on and off the field. His history of success in recruiting, constructing teams, and producing results at all levels of football makes him an ideal fit for Sacramento State. We look forward to welcoming him and his family back to his native Northern California and having him as part of the Sacramento community for years to come.\"\nThe Hornets will be the second FCS school to make the jump in 2026, joining North Dakota State. The Bison moved up from the Missouri Valley Conference to the Mountain West earlier this month. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        After a 2024 season in which Scottie Scheffler claimed half of the PGA Tour's signature events, all eight were won by different players in 2025. Parity was the name of the game as winner's checks worth $3.6 million and $4 million for the player invitationals were doled out to a variety of names, including not only Scheffler but Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas, among others.This week, the 2026 signature events get underway as the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am takes center stage. McIlroy enters as the reigning champion after kicking off a memorable spring in California last year, not only winning at Pebble Beach but adding The Players Championship and his first Masters green jacket to three early season wins. He will be playing his first PGA Tour event of 2026, as will Tommy Fleetwood, who won the FedEx Cup a year ago.The stakes are elevated when a signature event falls on the calendar, which means the payouts are raised, too. Not only will $3.6 million of the $20 million purse be awarded to the winner, every player inside the top 10 will clear $500,000 and those inside the top 20 will each earn north of $250,000.Let's take a look at how the payouts for the 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am will be divided among the 80 players at Pebble Beach Golf Links.2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am prize money, purseTotal Purse: $20 million\n1st: $3,600,0002nd: $2,160,0003rd: $1,360,0004th: $960,0005th: $795,0006th: $715,0007th: $665,0008th: $615,0009th: $575,00010th: $535,00011th: $495,00012th: $455,00013th: $415,00014th: $375,00015th: $352,00016th: $332,00017th: $312,00018th: $292,00019th: $272,00020th: $252,00021st: $232,00022nd: $217,00023rd: $202,00024th: $187,00025th: $172,00026th: $158,00027th: $150,00028th: $143,00029th: $137,00030th: $131,00031st: $125,00032nd: $119,00033rd: $114,00034th: $109,00035th: $104,00036th: $99,00037th: $94,00038th: $89,00039th: $84,00040th: $80,00041st: $76,00042nd: $72,00043rd: $68,00044th: $64,00045th: $60,00046th: $57,00047th: $54,00048th: $52,00049th: $50,00050th: $48,00051st: $47,00052nd: $46,00053rd: $45,00054th: $44,00055th: $43,00056th: $42,00057th: $41,00058th: $40,00059th: $39,50060th: $39,00061st: $38,50062nd: $38,00063rd: $37,50064th: $37,00065th: $36,50066th: $36,00067th: $35,50068th: $35,00069th: $34,75070th: $34,50071st: $34,25072nd: $34,00073rd: $33,75074th: $33,50075th: $33,25076th: $33,00077th: $32,75078th: $32,50079th: $32,25080th: $32,000\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 NBA Slam Dunk Contest field is set, and four high-flyers will be dunking for the trophy on Saturday evening in Los Angeles. This year's Dunk Contest field is light on star power. and the headlining event on Saturday night will be extremely light on star power. Jaxson Hayes of the Los Angeles Lakers, Carter Bryant of the San Antonio Spurs, Keshad Johnson of the Miami Heat and Jase Richardson of the Orlando Magic will be the four competing for the crown. The field does not have an All-Star in it, but Bryant, Johnson and Richardson will inject a bit of youth into the proceedings. We've seen in the past that sometimes the unknown competitors can breathe some life into the event. That's certainly what the NBA will hope for, but fans will likely enter the night a bit skeptical that the Dunk Contest will deliver high marks. Hayes recently went between the legs for a slam on a fastbreak against the Chicago Bulls and is known for his high-flying theatrics. Hayes, a 7-footer, is averaging 6.4 points and 3.8 rebounds per game this season for the Lakers.\nBryant, an athletic first-year player out of Arizona, has played in 40 games this season as a first-round pick. He is averaging 2.8 points and 1.8 rebounds in 8.6 minutes per game. Richardson, a rookie out of Michigan State, has played in 36 games this season and is averaging 5.1 points per game in 12 minuter per night in Orlando. \nJohnson is in his second year in the league with the Heat and has appeared in 21 games, averaging 3.1 points per game in 7.6 minutes of action per night. 2026 NBA Dunk Contest field, odds(Odds via FanDuel)Carter Bryant, Spurs: +180Jaxson Hayes, Lakers: +240Keshad Johnson, Heat: +310Jase Richardson, Magic: +430Why is Mac McClung not in this year's Slam Dunk Contest?Three-time reigning Slam Dunk Contest champion Mac McClung will not participate in this year's event after he was waived by the Indiana Pacers in November following a three-game stint.While his NBA opportunities have been limited, McClung made a reputation as a supreme athlete with elite dunking ability. He won the league's midseason extravaganza at each of the last three All-Star weekends. McClung also boasts a track record as a G League standout and won the MVP award at the end of a stellar year with the Osceola Magic last fall.\nRecent NBA Slam Dunk Contest winners2025: Mac McClung2024: Mac McClung2023: Mac McClung2022: Obi Toppin2021: Anfernee Simons2020: Derrick Jones Jr.2019: Hamidou Diallo2018: Donovan Mitchell2017: Glenn Robinson III2016: Zach LaVine\n            ",

    "body": "\n        No. 16 Texas Tech roared back to stun No. 1 Arizona 78-75 in overtime on Saturday in a Big 12 thriller with wide-ranging ramifications. The loss caps an 0-2 week for the Wildcats, who were the last unbeaten high-major team until Monday night's loss at Kansas.Arizona led 64-57 with just over three minutes left in regulation before going cold down the stretch while playing shorthanded. Star freshman forward Koa Peat did not play in the second half due to a lower body injury, effectively leaving Arizona with a six-man rotation.The Wildcats (23-2, 10-2 Big 12) were also without freshman forward Dwayne Aristode due to illness. Texas Tech (19-6, 9-3 Big 12) is not a deep team, either, but the Red Raiders have grown accustomed to playing long minutes this season, and they rose to the occasion late.JT Toppin led the way with 31 points and 13 rebounds in 44 minutes for the Red Raiders and scored eight in the overtime period. His offensive rebound with six seconds left also helped cement the outcome.\nChristian Anderson added 19 points and eight assists. He played all 45 minutes.\nThe outcome solidifies the chances that No. 2 Michigan jumps to No. 1 in the AP Top 25 poll on Monday. It also means No. 3 Houston (23-2, 11-1 Big 12) is now alone atop the Big 12 standings.Texas Tech has now defeated three of the No. 1 seeds in CBS Sports Bracketology, as the Red Raiders also own wins over Duke and Houston.Why Arizona will remain a No. 1 seedIt's just Arizona's second loss, and it's not a bad loss. Therefore, the Wildcats are expected to remain on the No. 1 seed line in the CBS Sports Bracketology model. \nHowever, this will create some separation between Michigan and Arizona for the time being. The model already favored Michigan as the No. 1 overall seed due to its No. 1 ranking in WAB (Wins Above Bubble) and No. 1 ranking at KenPom. But it was harder to draw a distinction between the teams when they both had just one loss. The call for No. 1 overall is certainly more obvious now.What about Texas Tech?Texas Tech is projected by the CBS Sports Bracketology model to stay a No. 4 seed but to move up within the No. 4 seed hierarchy. Over the long run, a metric-moving result like beating the nation's No. 1 team on the road will help tremendously in making a push back toward the No. 3 line practical for the Red Raiders, who reached the Elite Eight as a No. 3 seed last season. Beating the NET's No. 2 team on the road is worth a whopping 0.93 in WAB, which could result in a 3-4 spot jump for the Red Raiders, who entered the day at No. 15 in the important resume metric. Texas Tech's six losses are all of the Quad 1 variety, and it now has six Quad 1 wins to match them.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Caleb Wilson is North Carolina's best player and emotional leader; big man Henri Veesaar is North Carolina's second-best player by every metric. UNC knew it was not going to have Wilson a fracture in his left hand was discovered earlier this week, but Veesaar was under the weather and was held out of Saturday's home tilt against Pitt.And yet, the 11th-ranked Tar Heels comfortably held off Jeff Capel's Panthers 79-65 in a game that was not as close as the final score indicated without a starting front line that had been as dominant as any frontcourt in college basketball outside of Michigan, Florida and Arizona.Pitt is one of the ACC bottom-feeders, but UNC played well and showed glimpses of the new way it's going to have to win ballgames with Wilson sidelined indefinitely.\n        \n            \n                Michigan makes case to jump Arizona for the No. 1 spot in next AP Top 25 poll after dominant win over UCLA\n                \n                    Cameron Salerno                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLet's dive into key observations.Talented options shine in new rolesIt's time for Luka Bogavac to get it rolling. The international veteran had been shifted to a second-unit role, but he got re-inserted into the starting lineup and balled out with 15 points and four assists in 33 minutes. His individual creation is something this UNC offense needs to create some semblance of a jolt. \nAlabama transfer Jarin Stevenson also shined in an expanded role. Stevenson didn't shot-hunt at all. He just took what the defense gave him, and that resulted in 19 points on just seven shots. Stevenson drilled three triples and all four of his free throws. He played 36 turnover-free minutes. That's exactly what the doctor ordered.One guy can't replace Wilson's production, but Stevenson and Bogavac have to raise their level.They did just that on Saturday. Can they do it again?Don't expect much on the offensive glassUNC averages over 12 second-chance points, which ranks in the 77th percentile nationally, per CBB Analytics, thanks to the relentless effort from Wilson and Veesaar. \nUnsurprisingly, UNC was not able to be an impactful offensive-rebounding team against the Panthers. UNC totaled just six offensive rebounds on its 32 missed shots. That 18.8 offensive rebound rate is the second-lowest mark of the season for UNC.The Tar Heels' shot selection is going to have to be even better moving forward because those second-chance points that have fueled the Heels for long stretches this season is not going to be a strength while Wilson is on the mend. Dixon's steady hand steers the shipBall control will be even more paramount for UNC without the offensive rebounding to serve as a buffer. That means a freshman like Derek Dixon just has to play clean basketball.\nHe was great against Pitt. He had seven assists and just one turnover. He got the ball where it needed to go and was super unselfish in setting the table for this group and getting the ball where it needed to go. Backup big man Zayden High delivered a career-high 15 points, but it was Dixon who expertly set up High left and right.More of that, por favor.Interior defense pros and consPitt got whatever it wanted in the paint against UNC. The Panthers shot 13 for 20 at the rim and totaled 34 paint points. Pitt big man Cam Corhen got rolling early with some pick-and-pop treys and then started eating inside the arc on his way to a 23-point showing. He was terrific. UNC also struggled to contain versatile forward Roman Siulepa (14 points on 10 shots) for stretches.It just is what it is with High as the primary shot-blocker. There's just very little resistance when High and Stevenson are the primary interior defenders. \nBut Saturday was the worst it could be. Veesaar's return is imminent — he's expected to suit up for Tuesday's road tilt against rival N.C. State — and UNC's defense needs its 7-footer on the floor as soon as possible. Wilson will be unquestionably missed, but Veesaar can keep UNC's defense afloat with his interior rim protection and mobility on the perimeter. Thankfully for UNC, none of its next three opponents (NC State, Syracuse and Louisville) has that bruising center that you're terrified of.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        INGLEWOOD, Calif. -- Another year, another alteration to the NBA All-Star Game. Kevin Durant was asked about the new USA vs. the World format on Saturday during media day at the Intuit Dome and whether it would solve the league's perceived problems with the event. He mostly shrugged it off. Durant said he felt like \"fans and the media need something to complain about.\" KD wasn't the only player who was pressed on the topic. Luka Dončić. Nikola Jokić. Anthony Edwards. They all got asked various versions of the question. Adam Silver wasn't so lucky.The commissioner spoke for roughly half an hour and didn't get a single question about the All-Star festivities and having to tweak the proceedings yet again to try to juice fan interest and compel the players to actually compete. Most years, that would have been top of mind for the media and the commissioner. This is not most years for Silver or the NBA. As Silver's annual press conference predictably revealed, the league is facing any number of pressing issues that come complete with significant PR problems. Tanking. A star player partnering with a prediction market. The investigation into the alleged cap circumvention by the Clippers (who are hosting this weekend's events in an all-time well this is awkward everyone just act normal situation.) When those are the main subjects things have gone sideways. \nThis is Silver's 12th full season as commissioner. It is shaping up to be his most challenging, which is saying an awful lot considering one of the very first issues he was tasked with handling was hitting the eject button on former Clippers owner Donald Sterling, who was caught on tape making racist remarks. Earlier this week, the NBA fined the Jazz $500,000 and the Pacers $100,000 for tanking measures that the league took umbrage with. On Saturday, Silver conceded that tanking has been part of the league for a long time and even allowed that it can create a certain amount of interest at times because \"fans are rooting for their teams to be bad\" in order to potentially improve their draft position. But he also said that it's clear \"the incentives are misaligned.\"\"Are we seeing behavior that is worse this year than we've seen in recent memory?\" Silver asked rhetorically. \"Yes, in my view. Which is what led to those fines. And not just the fines, but my statement that we're going to be looking more closely at the totality of all the circumstances this season in terms of teams' behavior and very intentionally wanted teams to be on notice.\"\nThe problem with figuring out how to punish or discourage tanking, as Silver admitted, is that \"there's a bit of a know it when you see it quality to this.\" In other words, it's subjective and the league has essentially announced that it will be operating in a gray area with regard to disciplinary measures on that front. \"That,\" Silver said, \"is not necessarily a position we want to be in.\"There is no shortage of positions they would rather not be in these days. Holding All-Star weekend at the Inuit Dome while also looking at the Clippers for potential cap circumvention and tampering violations can't be comfortable for anyone. Silver reminded the assembly that the league office is not directly leading the investigation and instead that responsibility has been taken over by an outside law firm. He said from everything he's been told \"the Clippers have been fully cooperative, but as I said I'm not involved in the day to day.\" He called the matter \"enormously complex\" and added that he's reached no conclusions yet. The whole thing came off like Silver's version of the This is Fine meme. He employed the same approach when asked about Giannis Antetokounmpo announcing he had joined the prediction market Kalshi as a shareholder. The commish said \"it's an issue that I'm paying enormous amount of attention to.\" But he also downplayed Antetokounmpo's involvement, noting that the league has a rule for sports betting where players can make small investments in gambling companies. That same rule now applies to prediction markets. \n\"That means their investment cannot amount to over one percent,\" Silver explained. \"In the case of Giannis, from what I understand, it's a minuscule investment, much smaller than one percent. So that does not violate the rules.\"And yet, while not violating the rules, it's obviously not a great look for the league -- which is something Silver seemed to grasp as he tried to spin that topic into something closer to a net neutral for the NBA. \"It concerns me,\" Silver continued, \"in the totality of all this betting that we need a better handle, no pun intended, on all the different activity that's happening out there.\"Concerns over tanking. Concerns about the Clippers. Concerns about sports gambling and prediction markets. But they're looking into all of it -- or a law firm is in the case of the Clippers. And hey as far as prediction market investments and Giannis go, it's a small thing. Nothing to worry about.\nAs damage control goes, I'm not sure how effective any of Silver's efforts were. I sat through the entire press conference and read the transcript several times and mostly it came off as attempted deflection. As one reporter said to me afterward, Silver is really good at saying a lot of things without saying much at all. Maybe that's because all these issues swirling around the league don't come with quick or clear fixes. I don't envy him. But then no one said being in charge would be easy, either.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        No. 5 Iowa State staged a 20-2 run just before halftime Saturday vs. No. 9 Kansas and never looked back in a 74-56 blowout inside Hilton Coliseum, handing the Jayhawks their first loss in more than a month to shake up the Big 12 title race. The Cyclones' defense held KU to its second-lowest field goal percentage in a game all season while also forcing 13 turnovers, and their offense was equally as potent in a balanced beatdown.The win is Iowa State's largest by final margin vs. Kansas ever in a game played in Ames, Iowa, and tied for its second-largest over KU by final margin with a February 8, 1955 (!!) 18-point win. The only other bigger beatdown of the Jayhawks by the Cyclones was on March 10, 1973, when they defeated Kansas in Lawrence 89-65.Both teams entered the game as No. 3 seeds in the latest CBS Sports Bracketology with the model suggesting the Cyclones could move up to a No. 2 seed with the victory.Iowa State star Milan Momcilovic spearheaded the spectacular day on offense with 18 points and four made 3-pointers, and the quartet of Tamin Lipsey, Joshua Jefferson, Jamarion Batemon and Blake Buchanan each added 11 points of their own. Buchanan set the tone early with nine first-half points on a perfect 4-for-4 shooting, and Momcilovic closed it down with 14 of his final 18 points coming in the second half – including going 4 of 5 frame from beyond the arc.\nAt one point Momcilovic nailed a fadeaway 3-pointer from the corner over KU defensive star Flory Bidunga and could do nothing but smile at his hot hand. \nPeterson plays just 24 minutes in lopsided lossDefensively was where Iowa State really shined as it held KU, averaging 78 points per game entering the day, to a meager 56 points in the losing effort. That tied for the fewest it has scored in a game all season, and was executed by holding Bidunga, the Big 12 field-goal percentage leader shooting 68.6% on the season, to a 5-of-13 (38.5%) outing – his second-worst shooting performance by percentage in a game he's taken five or more shots in all season. The Cyclones also held Darryn Peterson, KU's star freshman to10 points on 3-of-10 shooting with three turnovers and no assists. Peterson played just 24 minutes in the loss and was not part of its closing lineup, which Kansas coach Bill Self said was due in part to game flow but also in part because of his conditioning. Peterson missed KU's victory vs. Arizona on Monday with an illness, and Self said that illness lingered throughout the week, cutting into his ability to practice and prep for Saturday's game.\n\"I tried to sub him because he's been sick,\" Self said. \"So when he needed to come out there at the end, I was thinking, 'What do we do to give us to have the best chance to have success on Wednesday.' So that was me making that decision.\"It was a rough game for the projected No. 1 pick, but as Self noted, that was true of almost every KU player — not just Peterson.\"I didn't think he was great,\" he said. \"But he hadn't practiced much. I don't think he was bad, I just don't think anybody, except Elmarko [Jackson], was great today.\"\nBig 12 race tightens-upIowa State and Kansas had diametrically different weeks leading into Saturday, which made the outcome all the more stunning. ISU fell in an ugly 62-55 road loss at TCU on Tuesday despite being 7.5-point favorites, and Kansas knocked off No. 1 Arizona 82-78 on Monday. It says a lot about the Big 12 that Iowa State – even with Saturday's outcome – is even within one game of league-leading Arizona and Houston. The Cyclones and Jayhawks are both 1.5 games back in the standings behind the Wildcats and Cougars, though there are more than a half-dozen regular-season games remaining.We could and should learn a lot about that race soon as Houston makes its way to face Iowa State in Ames on Monday, and Arizona hosts ISU in Tucson on March 2 for its penultimate regular-season game. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        With just over one month until Selection Sunday and conference races heating up across the college basketball landscape, Saturday is set to provide a platform for spectacular theater as the sport kicks into high gear near the homestretch of the regular season. There are pivotal games that could well decide conference races in the Big 12, ACC, SEC, Big Ten, WCC and plenty more.  In total there are 21 ranked teams set for Saturday tilts, which includes four ranked vs. ranked matchups and a top-10 showdown in Ames, Iowa between Kansas and Iowa State to boot.  CBS will also be the home of a major showdown in the Big Ten as No. 2 Michigan welcomes UCLA to Ann Arbor for a 12:45 p.m. tip from the Crisler Center. A win for the Wolverines would almost certainly put them at No. 1 in Monday's AP Top 25 poll for the first time in more than a decade after No. 1 Arizona stumbled Monday at Kansas.  With so much at stake and so many tremendous games on tap, our team has picks below for some of the best we'll be watching closely. Those picks are below.      \nOdds via DraftKings Sportsbook | All times ET            No. 25 Kentucky at No. 14 Florida                        \n3 p.m. on ABC, fuboTV (try for free): Kentucky has won eight of nine and done so shorthanded with Jaland Lowe and Jayden Quaintance shelved. But on the road against a team I think is the best in the SEC is a tough spot to keep that hot streak rolling. I think the Wildcats could keep this respectably close -- Florida is just 5-6 this season ATS as home favorites -- but the Gators pull away for a cushy win down the stretch. Pick: Kentucky +11.5 (Boone)    \t \t  \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            UF -11.5\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kentucky\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kentucky\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kentucky\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kentucky\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Florida\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kentucky\n                    \n    \n    STRAIGHT-UP\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Florida\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Florida\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Florida\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Florida\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Florida\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Florida\n                    \n    \n      No. 16 Texas Tech at No. 1 Arizona  \n6:30 p.m. on ESPN, fuboTV (try for free): Perhaps the 82-78 loss at Kansas on Monday was a sign that Arizona could be ducking off a bit as conference competition tightens. That's just not what I, personally, believe will happen. This Wildcats team is clearly on a different level right now even after its first of the season. I think they get back on track at home and do it in style. Pick: Arizona -9.5 (Boone)     \t \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            ZONA -9.5\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Texas Tech\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Texas Tech\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Texas Tech\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    STRAIGHT-UP\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n                No. 20 Clemson at No. 4 Duke  \n12 p.m. on ESPN, fuboTV (try for free): This feels like a big number to lay -- and yet I think I would lay it for this Duke team. They've won their last three home games by an average margin of 23.3 points, and they get a Clemson team that's a terrific matchup on paper and coming off an ugly loss to Virginia Tech. Pick: Duke -12.5 (Boone)    \n  \t \t  \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            DUKE -12.5\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Clemson\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Clemson\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Clemson\n                    \n    \n    STRAIGHT-UP\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n      UCLA at No. 2 Michigan  \n12:45 p.m. on CBS, CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App, Paramount+ Premium:  It's almost difficult to compute lines with this Michigan team because it leads college basketball in scoring margin and has been completely dominant. So even a line as big as 15.5 points won't scare me off from laying it with this Wolverines bunch. They are 7-5 ATS as home favorites on the season and they draw a UCLA matchup that, like most Michigan opponents, doesn't have the size or physicality to match up well with on paper. Pick: UM -15.5 (Boone)      \t \t  \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            UM -15.5\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            UCLA\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            UCLA\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    STRAIGHT-UP\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n          No. 9 Kansas at No. 5 Iowa State                \n1 p.m. on ABC, fuboTV (try for free): This feels like a classic spot on the schedule for Iowa State to flex its muscles and get back on track in front of its home crowd. But I am going against my gut here and taking KU to win straight up as road dogs. This Jayhawks team has won eight-straight and is coming off an impressive win over the No. 1 team in the country earlier in the week. And they are 5-3 ATS as underdogs on the season. The line feels like it should be closer to a pick. Pick: Kansas +5.5 (Boone)    \t \t  \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            ISU -5.5\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kansas\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kansas\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kansas\n                    \n    \n    STRAIGHT-UP\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kansas\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kansas\n                    \n    \n    Who will win and cover in every college basketball game? Visit SportsLine to get picks from the model that simulates each game 10,000 times and is up more than $1,200 for $100 players on its top-rated spread picks the past six years.       \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Teams hit hard by the transfer portal meet when the Florida International Panthers face the UTSA Roadrunners in the 2025 First Responder Bowl on Friday night. FIU is coming off a 56-16 win at Sam Houston  State on Nov. 29, while UTSA dropped a 27-24 decision to Army that same day. FIU (7-5), who finished tied for fourth in Conference USA at 5-3, have won four in a row. UTSA (6-6), who tied for sixth in the American Conference, have won two of three. Both sides are expected to be down multiple key players due to injuries and the transfer portal, with FIU particularly decimated in the secondary. FIU's quarterback situation is a bit unclear as well after Keyone Jenkins and Joe Pesansky both dealt with injuries late in the season. Both are expected to play in some capacity on Friday. Kickoff from Gerald J. Ford Stadium in Dallas is at 8 p.m. ET. The Roadrunners are 6.5-point favorites in the latest FIU vs. UTSA odds, while the over/under for total points scored is 61.5 via SportsLine consensus. Before making any UTSA vs. FIU picks, check out the college football predictions from the SportsLine Projection Model. New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your $5+ bet wins:The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times, and it is 31-19 on its top-rated college football money-line picks since the beginning of the 2024 season. Now, the model has set its sights on FIU vs. UTSA.

    "body": "\n        Week 17 is the championship matchup in a vast majority of Fantasy football leagues, so it's the biggest week for Fantasy lineup decisions of the year for those who have made it thus far. In 2024, the players who had starred all year also showed up in the penultimate week as Joe Burrow, Saquon Barkley, Derrick Henry and Trey McBride were among the stats leaders. This year, it's the likes of Josh Allen, Jonathan Taylor and Puka Nacua who have excelled and remain must-starts as Week 17 Fantasy football picks.As for your Fantasy football start/sit decisions, targeting players on teams with something to play for that are facing teams out of playoff contention could be the way to go. So, the likes of Jaylen Warren, Baker Mayfield, Bucky Irving and Stefon Diggs may find themselves a bit higher in the Week 17 Fantasy football projections than expected. Some NFL injuries of note to consider for Fantasy include Lamar Jackson (doubtful, back) and Jordan Love (questionable, concussion/shoulder), both of whom are scheduled to play on Saturday night.Before setting your Week 17 Fantasy football lineups for championship matchups, be sure to check out the Week 17 Fantasy football rankings from the proven computer model at SportsLine. Bet on every NFL Week 17 game at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your $5 initial wager wins:When it comes to ranking players, SportsLine's model beat human experts in Fantasy football for the past several seasons, especially when there were big differences in ranking. Over the course of a season, that could literally be the difference between winning your league or going home empty-handed.The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, including being ahead of the curve on players like A.J. Brown, Jonathan Taylor, Derrick Henry, Christian McCaffrey, Alvin Kamara and Jahmyr Gibbs. Anybody who banked on players like those could have made a run at their league title.Now, the model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, has revealed its Fantasy football rankings for Week 17 of the 2025 NFL season. Head to SportsLine now to see them. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $250 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. Top Week 17 Fantasy football picks One surprise in Week 17: The model is fading Jags wideout Brian Thomas Jr., a Pro Bowler last year who finished third in receiving yards. Thomas, who is owned in almost all leagues being started in nearly half of them, has been a top-25 Fantasy receiver over the last three weeks, but this has been his best stretch all season as inconsistency has defined his sophomore year. He had a season-low of 18 yards last week, as both Parker Washington and Jakobi Meyers have passed Thomas in the eyes of Trevor Lawrence, as those two are averaging more receptions and yards over the last month. Thomas may not warrant a spot in Week 17 Fantasy football lineups as he sits outside the top 30 in wide receiver rankings.Another curveball: The model is high on Rams tight end Colby Parkinson, despite him being the TE22 on the season and being started in just 38% of leagues this week. Parkinson has quietly performed as the TE6 since Week 10 as he's made the most of Tyler Higbee going on injured reserve. The former has six touchdowns over his last seven games while averaging 35.9 receiving yards over this stretch. He should continue that success on Monday night versus a Falcons defense which just allowed 11 catches and 118 yards to the tight end position on Sunday, which came a week after giving up a tight end touchdown.

This pick could be the difference between winning big and going home with nothing.

The Over is a combined 8-3 for the squads in road/neutral-site games in 2025. Also, the recent history of this bowl has leaned way over the total as the last two Rate Bowls have each seen 85 combined points scored.Both squads are solid versus the run but sieves versus the pass. Each allows a completion rate of over 68%, which puts them among the worst seven teams out of the 136 FBS programs. Thus, one can expect both offenses to air it out, which leads to lots of points on the scoreboard. The model forecasts the Over to hit with plenty of points to spare as simulations call for 54 combined points. Thus, the Over hits 70% of the time.The model also says one side of the spread hits nearly 60% of the time. You can see the model's pick at SportsLine.  So who wins Minnesota vs. New Mexico, and which side of the spread hits nearly 60% of the time? Visit SportsLine now to see which side of the New Mexico vs. Minnesota spread to jump on, all from the model that has simulated this matchup 10,000 times, and find out.\n            ",

Facing Aston Villa, United suffered their first loss in four matches, and it was a costly one as midfielder Bruno Fernandes left with an injury. While manager Ruben Amorim wouldn't put a timescale on how long Fernandes will be out, missing any time is already too much for  United, given their absences.How to watch Manchester United vs. Newcastle United, oddsDate: Friday, Dec. 26 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Old Trafford -- Manchester, England TV: USAOdds: Manchester United +160; Draw +260; Newcastle United +160Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbuemo are unavailable for the foreseeable future while on international duty for the Africa Cup of Nations, and midfielder Kobbie Mainoo also missed the Villa match due to a calf issue. With a shoestring squad and a tight group of teams in midtable, any dropped points during the festive period could prove to be costly for Manchester United.It'll be even tougher with Newcastle United being one of the teams looking to catch them in the league. Eddie Howe's Magpies have struggled to string together wins despite their Champions League form and sit 11th in the league entering match day 18. But with Yoan Wissa finally back to full health and Nick Woltemade finding the back of the net, they'll officially have their first choice strike force for looking to take down United. Newcastle may be six points off a European spot, but with matches coming thick and fast, this is when teams can quickly make up ground.With only one win so far in December, the time is now for Newcastle's form to turn around, as defensively, they've been one of the best teams in the league. Despite allowing six goals in December, only Arsenal has a better expected goals against than Newcastle's 3.83. The Magpies have only allowed 10 shots on goal in their four games this mont,h and with United's attacking woes, this is a match where the defense should shine yet again.\nIf things don't start turning around soon, that's where, despite Champions League success and winning the EFL Cup last season to end a lengthy trophy drought, questions will begin to circle around if more change is needed at St. James' Park with the January transfer window opening soon. It's hard to call matches a must win at this stage of the season, but given the table, it's a match that neither side can afford to lose.\n            \n    ",

The loss was the Lakers' third straight defeat, and coach JJ Redick was quick to rip into his squad after the game.\"We don't care enough right now,\" Redick said. \"And that's the part that bothers you a lot. We don't care enough to do the things that are necessary. We don't care enough to be a professional.\"Redick's frustration and questioning of his team's professionalism came after the Lakers fell to 4-6 in their last 10 games following a 15-4 start to the season. The Lakers trailed by double digits for the entirety of the second half against the Rockets, only adding fuel to Redick's post-game comments.\"The two words of the day were effort and execution,\" Redick said. \"And I feel like when we've done both of those things at a high level, we've been a good basketball team. When we haven't, we're a terrible basketball team. And tonight we were a terrible basketball team. And that started legitimately right away.\"  \nThe effort Redick questioned could be seen in nearly all facets of the game, including the Rockets outrebounding the Lakers 48-25.Redick promised an \"uncomfortable\" practice for his team on Saturday as they prepare for Sunday's game against the Sacramento Kings. The Kings sit last in the Western Conference at 7-23 and offer an opportunity for Los Angeles to get things moving in the right direction.Lakers star Luka Dončić, who leads the NBA with 33.7 points per game, echoed his coach's comments following the loss.\n\"I don't know what has to change, but definitely something needs to change,\" Dončić said. \"Think we [were] blown out the last three games. It definitely looks, like, terrible. We just got to talk about it. Everybody got to talk about it. I know JJ said it's going to be uncomfortable [for everybody]. As they should be. Everybody has got to give better effort, starting with me.\"\n            \n    ",

The Las Vegas Raiders and New York Giants have each lost nine straight games, but one of those teams will end its streak on Sunday.Both of these teams are limping to the finish line, but that's especially the case for the Giants. They lost star tackle Andrew Thomas in Sunday's loss to the Minnesota Vikings -- and it seemed like interim coach Mike Kafka had no interest in letting quarterback Jaxson Dart drop back and throw. Dart threw all of 13 times despite it being a competitive game in which the Giants trailed late. New York seems like a franchise looking ahead to the offseason and a new regime.The Raiders, on the other hand, were at least competitive against the Houston Texans. Rookie running back Ashton Jeanty had the best game of his career, which had to be a terrific sign for Las Vegas. Houston's defense is among the best units in the NFL, and Jeanty carved them up. Jeanty should have no issue repeating that effort against a porous Giants run defense. The Las Vegas defense has had its share of issues -- outside of Maxx Crosby -- but that may not matter based on how the New York offense has looked recently.Here is everything you need to know about this matchup of teams battling for the No. 1 overall pick.\nWhere to watch Giants vs. Raiders liveDate: Sunday, Dec. 28 | Time: 4:05 p.m. ETLocation: Allegiant Stadium -- Las Vegas, NevadaTV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports App Odds: Giants -1.5, O/U 41.5 (via DraftKings)Giants vs. Raiders: Need to knowDart off-target as of late. Dart's career got off to a promising star, but he has slowed down a bit since returning from his concussion. Dart hasn't been running the ball as much, and the Giants were reticent to put the ball in his hands against an aggressive Vikings defense last week. That led to Dart throwing for 33 yards and an interception while adding just seven rushing yards. At least the Raiders defense provides a soft landing spot after that outing.Dream matchup for Jeanty. Last weekend, Jeanty went off against one of the league's best rushing defenses for 128 yards and a score. He even added a 60-yard receiving touchdown for good measure. Now, he gets a much more favorable matchup as the Giants come to town. New York's rush defense has been putrid all season as it allows an average of 150.9 yards per game. Only the Cincinnati Bengals are worse in that department. Jeanty could be in for a monster outing.Tank-a-thon matchup of the week. The Giants and Raiders are both 2-13 with the former holding a tiebreaker for the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. That tiebreaker won't matter on Sunday morning since one team has to win this game (barring a tie). That means the loser of this game may wind up a winner (and vice versa). How many fans will be rooting for the opposing team to win this weekend?Giants vs. Raiders prediction, pick\nBetting on a team in the midst of a nine-game losing streak doesn't feel good, but that's the reality of this matchup. Because of how poor the Giants run defense has been all season -- and how shaky Dart has looked since returning from injury -- I do lean toward the Raiders at home. Luckily, they don't have to cover a big number. Pick: Raiders +1.5, Over 41.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

The Seahawks are in this position after pulling off an improbable, come-from-behind win over the Los Angeles Rams in Week 16. Carolina (8-7) can stay ahead of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the NFC South standings if they are able to defeat the Seahawks. The Panthers are currently holding onto the NFC's No. 4 seed after recording a 23-20 win over the Buccaneers last Sunday. \nWhere to watch Seahawks vs. Panthers liveDate: Sunday, Dec. 28 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation:  Bank of America Stadium -- Charlotte, North Carolina TV: FOX | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Seahawks -7, O/U 42.5 (via DraftKings)Seahawks vs. Panthers: Need to know Tough to beat. It's hard to find a weakness on Seattle's team. They're currently No. 3 in the league in scoring, second in points allowed, and have one of the league's top returners in Rashid Shaheed, who made the Pro Bowl less than a week after returning a punt 58 yards for a score during Seattle's win over Los Angeles. Elite WR. This has been a breakout season for former first-round pick Jaxon Smith-Njigba, who currently leads the NFL with 1,637 receiving yards. He's built a quick rapport this season with new quarterback Sam Darnold, who was just named to his second straight Pro Bowl. Just being Ernest. Seattle's defense has gotten stellar play this year from several players, especially linebacker Ernest Jones. Despite missing two games, Jones leads the team with 116 tackles and five interceptions. He had two interceptions -- including a pick-six -- during Seattle's Week 13 win over the Minnesota Vikings. Third-down woes. If the Seahawks have an Achilles heel, it's their third-down offense as they are currently 23rd in the league in that area. Fortunately for them, they'll be facing a Panthers defense that is 30th in the league on third down. Ground and pound? A strength of for a large portion of the season, the Panthers' running game hasn't been as good in recent weeks. Rico Dowdle recently crossed the 1,000-yard barrier, but he hasn't rushed for over 58 yards in six weeks. Chuba Hubbard, who had a season-high 83 rushing yards during the Panthers' Week 13 win over the Rams, has toted the rock just 14 times over the past two games. Emerging rookie. Panthers rookie wideout Tetairoa McMillan has quietly been having a highly-successful rookie season. His 924 receiving yards is nearly 600 more yards than Carolina's second leading receiver. Stingy secondary. Carolina's defense has been led by cornerbacks Jaycee Horn and Mike Jackson. The duo has combined to record eight interceptions, with Horn having a team-high five picks. Jackson's 17 pass breakups leads the entire league. Seahawks vs. Panthers prediction, pick \nOn paper, this should be a win for the Seahawks, who are trying to secure the top seed in the playoffs first the first time since 2014. That being said, the Panthers' 2025 season has largely been defined by upset wins over teams considered superior. I'm baking on that happening again on Sunday, largely because of Carolina's opportunistic defense and the reliable play of quarterback Bryce Young. Pick: Panthers +7, Under 42.5 \n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

The Bills are coming off a 23-20 victory over the Cleveland Browns, while the Eagles clinched the NFC East for the second straight year with a 29-18 victory over the Washington Commanders. Both teams have already clinched playoff berths, but seeding is to be determined.Believe it or not, Josh Allen and Jalen Hurts have faced off just once before, back in 2023. In that matchup, the Eagles defeated the Bills in overtime, 37-34. Buffalo led by 10 points entering the fourth quarter, but two Hurts passing touchdowns eventually got the game to overtime where the Eagles star QB finished off the comeback with a 12-yard touchdown run. What will happen this time around?Let's break down this interconference matchup. But first, here's how you can watch. \nWhere to watch Eagles vs. Bills liveDate: Sunday, Dec. 28 | Time: 4:25 p.m. ETLocation: Highmark Stadium -- Orchard Park, New YorkTV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Bills -1.5, O/U 43.5 (via DraftKings)Eagles vs. Bills: Need to knowHistorical clinching of the division: Last Saturday, the Eagles clinched their fifth straight playoff appearance and second straight NFC East title. Philadelphia becomes the first repeat NFC East champion since 2004, marking the end of the longest such drought in NFL/NBA/MLB/NHL history. Eagles offense finding their stride? They haven't faced the stiffest competition in recent weeks, but could we see the Eagles offense hit their stride and win the Super Bowl just like last year? Hurts has thrown five touchdowns without an interception over the past two games after throwing four interceptions and no touchdowns in that disastrous loss to the Los Angeles Chargers. His 24 passing touchdowns are the most by an Eagles player since 2017. However, this game on Sunday may be decided by the rushing attack.Bills run defense a problem: The Bills have the third-worst run defense in the NFL, allowing 144.3 rushing yards per game. Buffalo allows 5.4 yards per rush -- which ranks second-worst in the NFL. According to CBS Sports Research, those 5.4 yards per rush allowed ranks second-worst among playoff teams since 1970. The Bills have also already allowed the most 30-yard rushing touchdowns in a season in NFL history with eight.Who benefits from a high-scoring battle? The Bills' struggles defending the run are well-documented, but Allen and James Cook have often times been able to overcome it. If you want to engage in a shootout with the Bills, they usually win. Buffalo is 4-0 when allowing 31 or more points this season while the rest of the NFL is 9-93-2. Unreal.Bills' path to the No. 1 seed in the AFC: Win out + Denver Broncos loss + New England Patriots loss + Jacksonville Jaguars loss + Chargers loss. Eagles vs. Bills prediction, pick\nAt face value, the Bills probably look like the better team right now. However, I think it's possible the Eagles have turned a corner. If Kevin Patullo and Nick Sirianni are smart, Sunday is going to be about the ground game -- run the ball with Hurts and Saquon Barkley. While I'm not confident on the total, give me the Eagles in the upset. Philly is 5-1 straight up as an underdog over the last two seasons. Pick: Eagles +1.5, Over 43.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

The Dolphins are coming off a 45-21 beatdown loss that came at the hands of Joe Burrow and the Cincinnati Bengals, while the Buccaneers were upset by the rival Carolina Panthers, 23-20.Despite the loss to Carolina last Sunday, the Buccaneers aren't dead yet. The Panthers have a tough matchup this week against the Seattle Seahawks, meaning we could be looking at a win-and-in Week 18 showdown in Tampa. As for the Dolphins, they have already been eliminated from playoff contention and are trying out a new quarterback. We'll get more into that later. Let's break down this interconference matchup. But first, here's how you can watch the game. \nWhere to watch Buccaneers vs. Dolphins liveDate: Sunday, Dec. 28 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: Hard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, FloridaTV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Buccaneers -5.5, O/U 45.5 (via DraftKings)Buccaneers vs. Dolphins: Need to knowQuinn Ewers' debut. The rookie quarterback out of Texas completed 20 of 30 passes for zero touchdowns and two interceptions in his first NFL start. Miami was actually down just three points at the halftime before the Bengals scored 21 unanswered in the third quarter. Miami rushing attack. Predictably, the Dolphins wanted to run the ball to support their rookie signal-caller. De'Von Achane led the charge with 81 rushing yards and a touchdown, Jaylen Wright chipped in 35 yards and a touchdown, then Malik Washington scored a rushing touchdown as well. That made Miami the third team to have rushing touchdowns scored by three different players in a 20-point loss over the last 75 seasons. Mike McDaniel's job security. League sources indicated to CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones a belief that Mike McDaniel is likely to return as head coach of the Dolphins in 2026. Multiple prospective head coach and general manager candidates, as well as agents, told CBS Sports they are now operating under the belief the Dolphins will keep McDaniel.A season-altering losing streak. The Buccaneers have lost three straight games, and six out of the last seven following a 6-2 start. At one point, Mayfield looked like an MVP favorite while the Bucs looked like the easy choice to win the NFC South. That is no longer the case. What happened to the Bucs defense? Tampa Bay ranks No. 22 in total yards allowed per game (343.3), No. 24 in scoring defense (25.1 points allowed per game) and No. 27 in pass defense (242.0 passing yards allowed per game). The Bucs also have the second-worst opponent red-zone touchdown percentage (71.1%) in the league.CategoryFirst eight gamesLast seven gamesW-L6-21-6Points per game differential+2.4-7.0Turnover margin+7+1Buccaneers at Dolphins: prediction, pick\nThe Buccaneers have not been a good team to bet on this season. Their 5-10 against-the-spread record is tied for worst in the NFL, and they are 0-7 against the spread in their last seven games. With that being said, I'll go out on a limb and say Todd Bowles' defense and Mayfield's offense hit the field with aggression. This team is better than they've played over the past few weeks, and they understand it's do-or-die. Pick: Buccaneers -5.5, Over 45.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

The Colts are coming off a 48-27 loss to the San Francisco 49ers on \"Monday Night Football,\" while the Jaguars registered a 34-20 upset road victory over the Denver Broncos.These two teams faced off just three weeks ago, which was the matchup in which Daniel Jones tore his Achilles. Jacksonville won that game in a driving rain storm, 36-19. This recent push has the Jaguars sitting atop the division at 11-4, while the 8-7 Colts are in third place behind the 10-5 Houston Texans. The Philip Rivers experiment has been fun, but the fact of the matter is the Colts have lost five straight games, and now have only a 1.8% chance to make the playoffs, according to SportsLine's projections. Let's break down this divisional matchup. But first, here's how you can watch the game. \nWhere to watch Jaguars vs. Colts liveDate: Sunday, Dec. 28 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: Lucas Oil Stadium -- Indianapolis, IndianaTV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Jaguars -6.5, O/U 47.5 (via DraftKings)Jaguars vs. Colts: Need to knowTrevor Lawrence is on fire. Lawrence has been one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL over the last month or so, and completed 23 of 36 passes for 279 yards, three touchdowns, zero interceptions and added a touchdown on the ground vs. the Broncos. Last week, he became the fourth player all-time to score 10 touchdowns and commit zero turnovers in a two-game span, joining Josh Allen in 2024, Drew Brees in 2019 and Patrick Mahomes in 2018. Over the last six weeks, Lawrence is the NFL leader in yards per attempt (8.4), total touchdowns (19) and passer rating (108.7). Best streak in franchise history? The Jaguars' six-game win streak matches the franchise's longest single-season win streak since 1999, and the 34.2 points per game Jacksonville has averaged in that span are also the most points in a six-game span in Jags' history. The team has also scored 25 points in eight straight games, which is the longest streak in team history as well.Jonathan Taylor contained. The Colts running back looked like a legitimate MVP candidate for the majority of the season, but Taylor has been held under 100 rushing yards in five straight games. He's averaging 76 rushing yards per game and 3.7 yards per rush during that span, after averaging 113.9 rushing yards per game and 6.0 yards per rush in the first 10 games of the season.How do the Colts make the playoffs? It's unlikely, but Indy could still make the postseason. All the Colts need to do is beat the Jaguars on Sunday, and the Texans next week. The Texans also need to lose to the Los Angeles Chargers this Saturday. So, the Colts need to win out, and the Texans need to lose out.Jaguars vs. Colts prediction, pick\nThis Jaguars team is 10-5 against the spread, and clearly riding high following the upset win in Denver. As for the Colts, it was pretty notable that they gave up a whopping 48 points to the 49ers with extra time to prepare. Brock Purdy was magnificent with 295 passing yards, five touchdowns and one interception, which came late. Could Lawrence do something similar if Sauce Gardner is out again? With the number under a touchdown, I'll take the Jaguars. Pick: Jaguars -6.5, Over 47.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

Although the team's season finale at the New York Giants next weekend won't have any playoff implications, Prescott is determined to play and win.Prescott led the Cowboys to a 30-23 win over the Washington Commanders on Thursday, but he will feel the remnants of that victory for a few days. Prescott was hit 11 times, and he was brought down for six sacks.That being the case, the Cowboys may be inclined to protect their franchise quarterback next week. Prescott understands that perspective, but he wants the opportunity to close out the season with a win.\"I love this game,\" Prescott said. \"I love any opportunity I get to play it. That being said, if I get to go out there, I'm gonna give my best. I'm gonna prepare the same way. I'm gonna be the same player that you guys know. I understand the reasons why maybe not. If I'm approached with that, I'll handle that then.\"\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 17 playoff picture: Packers earn berth after Vikings eliminate Lions; Broncos chasing AFC's top seed\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nPrescott said there's a \"big difference\" between finishing 8-8-1 and 7-9-1. The Cowboys quarterback said that, in a fully healthy season, he's never finished below .500 and wants to keep that streak alive.\n\"A lot of pride,\" Prescott said. \"I think that's another reason to play at this point. I want to play. And in a season of being healthy, I've never had in all of my career life or career, a season under .500. That tie is going to come into play really well. It's a huge difference. It's just pride. It's pride, honestly.\"Cowboys coach Brian Schottenheimer said he would make a decision on Prescott after enjoying Christmas festivities.\"It's Christmas,\" Schottenheimer said. \"I'm gonna enjoy Christmas. I'm gonna have some eggnog. I'll deal with that when I get to looking back at the film. But definitely some eggnog, and we're playing to win.\"\nWith one week left to go, Prescott has put together one of the best seasons of his career. After throwing for 307 yards on Christmas, he now leads the NFL in passing yards with 4,482, and he's thrown 30 touchdowns to just 10 interceptions. If Prescott does play next week, he'll have a great opportunity to juice those numbers against an anemic Giants defense.\n            ",

Last Sunday, Arizona put up a fight but it was ultimately on the wrong end of a 26-19 final score against the visiting Atlanta Falcons. The loss dropped the Cards to 2-8 in one possession games. At 5-10, the Bengals are closing out their first losing season since 2020. But while the season as a whole has been forgettable, the Bengals have gotten encouraging play recently from some of their young defensive players. Cincinnati also has Joe Burrow back under center after he missed nine games with an injury. If there's a reason for optimism it's because the Bengals have gone 4-2 this season with Burrow, who threw four touchdown passes in last week's blowout win over the Dolphins in Miami. \nWhere to watch Cardinals vs. Bengals liveDate: Sunday, Dec. 28 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation:  Paycor Stadium -- Cincinnati, Ohio  TV: FOX | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Bengals -7, O/U 52.5 (via DraftKings)Cardinals vs. Bengals: Need to know Joe Cool. After having one of the worst games of his career, Burrow had one of his better ones last week in Miami. In his fourth game back from injury, Burrow went 25 of 32 for 309 yards in addition to his four touchdown passes. Ja'Marr Chase, the only Bengals player selected to the Pro Bowl, caught nine passes for 109 yards. Running back Chase Brown had three total touchdowns while amassing 109 all-purpose yards. Big 3. Cincinnati is a vastly better team when they have Burrow, Chase and fellow wideout Tee Higgins on the field together. The Bengals are 31-17 in games when all three players are available. Conversely, they are just 13-20 when they don't. Improving defense. While they are still last in the league in points allowed, Cincinnati's defense has nonetheless improved as the season has progressed. Over the past two weeks, the team has gotten interceptions from rookie Barrett Carter and 2023 third-round Jordan Battle. Against the Ravens two weeks ago, the Bengals got two sacks apiece from rookie linebacker Demetrius Knight Jr. and 2023 first-round pick Myles Murphy. Struggling offense. While their defense has been bad for most of the year, the Cardinals' offense has been pretty consistent this season in terms of scoring over 20 points per game until the past month. Over that span, Arizona has scored 20 points just once. Last week, the Cardinals scored 19 points despite rushing for 132 yards, their highest total since Week 10. McBride continues to produce. A Pro Bowl tight end each of the last two years, Arizona's Trey McBride has quickly a standout at his position. McBride has on pace to set new single-season highs after catching 109 passes for 1,098 yards in the Cardinals' first 15 games. He also has 10 touchdown catches, which is more than he had during his first three seasons combined. Cardinals vs. Bengals prediction, pick \nThe Cardinals are better than their record, so this game should be competitive well into in the second half. That being said, the Bengals should take care of business since Burrow, Chase, and Higgins are expected to all be on the field together. Brown's recent emergence should only make things easier for Cincinnati's \"Big Three.\" Pick: Bengals, -7, Under 52.5 \n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Travis Kelce might have played his final game at Arrowhead Stadium on Christmas night, but he isn't quite ready to make a final decision. After the Kansas City Chiefs' 20-13 loss to the Denver Broncos, Kelce addressed the ongoing speculation that the 2025 season will be his last.During player introductions, Kelce ran out of the tunnel and seemed to stop and soak in the moment. Most took that as an indicator that the seven-time All-Pro tight end would be retiring after the season, but Kelce said after the game he hasn't made up his mind.\"Honestly, I've just been focused on trying to win football games, man,\" Kelce said about the possibility of retirement. \"I'll make that decision with my family, friends and the Chiefs organization when the time comes.\"\nFor the most part, Kelce played coy when the prospect of retirement came up. The 36-year-old admitted Thursday's game was extra special with \"a whole lot of emotions,\" but only because it was \"a Christmas game.\" \n\"You've got everybody in the world watching you,\" Kelce said. \"You get to go out there with the young guys... primetime television. Excited for the guys around us, a lot of young guys getting an opportunity to taste what this NFL life on a big stage feels like.\"He also confessed to thinking that Thursday could be his last game at Arrowhead Stadium, but not for the reason most would think.\"The only time it ever crossed my mind was when I was driving in the other day and saw how big the Powerball was,\" Kelce said. \"I was like, 'Man, if I could just win that, I wouldn't have to work another day in my life.'\"\n\n        \n            \n                Agent's Take: From Patrick Mahomes' recovery, to Travis Kelce's potential retirement, Chiefs' future uncertain\n                \n                    Joel Corry                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIt was clear that Kelce wasn't ready to discuss retirement publicly, but what about privately? Kelce said he hasn't even had discussions with teammate Patrick Mahomes, who tore his ACL in Week 15, about his plans beyond 2025.\"I haven't talked to him about any of that, man,\" Kelce said. \"I wish this season wouldn't have happened the way it did with him going down.\"On the field, Kelce recorded five catches for 36 yards as fourth-year quarterback Chris Oladokun made his first career start. Kansas City managed to keep the game close but came up short once again, falling to 6-10 in what will be coach Andy Reid's first losing season with the Chiefs.\nKelce had high praise for his coach after the game, crediting Reid for setting the standard throughout his time in Kansas City.\"He's done it with integrity,\" Kelce said. \"He's done it with a lot of love and a lot of care for the people around him, not just the players but the coaches as well.\"Kelce and the Chiefs have one game remaining in the 2025 season, a road game against the Las Vegas Raiders next week. There's a chance it's Kelce's last game in a Chiefs uniform, but he isn't ready to commit to that just yet.\n            ",

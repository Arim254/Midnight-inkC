    "body": "\n        The NFL playoff race is heating up! The Pittsburgh Steelers stole first place in the AFC North from the Baltimore Ravens, the Chicago Bears fell from the No. 1 seed in the NFC to the No. 7 seed following their loss to the Green Bay Packers, and the Buffalo Bills registered an impressive fourth-quarter comeback against Joe Burrow and the Cincinnati Bengals. That loss secured Burrow's first losing season since his rookie year back in 2020. This week in the NFL, we get a rematch of Bills vs. New England Patriots, Jordan Love travels to take on one of the best defenses in the NFL in the Denver Broncos, while the \"Matthew Stafford Bowl\" takes place in Los Angeles. The Kansas City Chiefs also have a tough matchup against the Los Angeles Chargers. Following their loss to the Houston Texans, SportsLine says Kansas City has just a 6% chance to make the playoffs. Which teams should you pick in Week 15, and which should you fade? CBS Sports writers Jordan Dajani and Jared Dubin are here to break down the biggest games of the weekend. For clarity, lines for these selections were taken on Dec. 10 over at DraftKings Sportsbook. Atlanta Falcons at Tampa Bay Buccaneers (-4.5) (TNF)Dajani (Buccaneers -4.5): The Falcons looked like a disaster last Sunday. They are 1-7 in their last eight games, and are allowing almost 27 points per contest over that span. I do find it worrisome that the Buccaneers have dropped four out of their past five since starting 6-2, but with this game being at home, I have to lean towards the team still in playoff contention. Plus, Mike Evans, Bucky Irving, Chris Godwin and Jalen McMillan could be on the field together for the first time all year. The Bucs haven't covered the spread in five straight games, but this is a matchup where they can snap the streak …  Prediction: Buccaneers 27, Falcons 20\nDubin (Buccaneers -4.5): Tampa isn't exactly lighting the world on fire of late, but the Falcons seem to be dead in the water. Tampa should be able to move the ball on Thursday night, especially if Mike Evans and/or Jalen McMillan can make their returns from injury. The Falcons, meanwhile, seemingly cannot move the ball with any degree of consistency with Kirk Cousins under center. The Bucs have a good run defense and are weaker against the pass, which plays against what the Falcons would like to do given the current state of their roster.  … Prediction: Buccaneers 24, Falcons 13Baltimore Ravens (-2.5) at Cincinnati BengalsDajani (Bengals +2.5): The Ravens have lost two straight, and given the division lead back to Pittsburgh. The Bengals would have defeated the Bills last week if it were not for that mind-blowing fourth-quarter collapse, but this is Joe Burrow's first game back playing in front of his home fans, and Lamar Jackson has not looked like himself recently. For those reasons, give me the Bengals in a wildly entertaining affair …  Prediction: Bengals 35, Ravens 33Dubin (Ravens -2.5): I'm going down with the ship here. I have already gone down with the ship picking the Chiefs every week, so I might as well do it with the Ravens as well.  … Prediction: Ravens 27, Bengals 24\nLos Angeles Chargers at Kansas City Chiefs (-5.5)Dajani (Chargers +5.5): I'm not so sure that Justin Herbert didn't mess up his left hand for life. After undergoing surgery last Monday, he decided to play a week later, and was sacked a career-high seven times while rushing 10 times for 66 yards. As for the spread, this number is a bit large to me. Consider the Chargers defense ranks top 10 in yards allowed per game (282.2), points allowed per game (20.8), third-down percentage (34.4%), red zone touchdown percentage (52.5%), takeaways (18) and sacks (35). Patrick Mahomes and Co. were shut out in the first half at HOME last week for the first time since 2018, and while this Chargers defense is not exactly the Texans defense, I still believe they are going to give the Chiefs' backup offensive linemen trouble. Chiefs win this game, but I don't want to lay 5.5 points  …  Prediction: Chiefs 20, Chargers 17Dubin (Chargers +5.5): The Chargers did not look particularly good offensively on Monday night against the Eagles. Justin Herbert struggled to complete passes and looked somewhat uncomfortable in the pocket. But they still managed to win the game thanks to some solid rushing and an incredible defensive performance. I don't see Kansas City's offense exploding here, so I like the Chargers to at least keep the game close, even if Kansas City wins the game.  … Prediction: Chiefs 23, Chargers 20\n        \n            \n                Upset alert in Week 15? Why these favorites could fall, including Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBuffalo Bills (-1.5) at New England PatriotsDajani (Bills -1.5): I have a hard time imagining the Patriots sweeping the season series with the Bills -- even if Josh Allen has to win in New England this week. The Patriots have won 10 straight games, so it's probably time for an \"L,\" right? Obviously this is a good team, but how confident are we that New England is a legitimate Super Bowl contender? The Patriots have had the easiest schedule in the NFL, and their season-defining win is probably ... the Bills. Vegas agrees with me that revenge is coming for Foxborough…  Prediction: Bills 23, Patriots 21\nDubin (Bills -1.5): It took a trio of uncharacteristic turnovers for the Patriots to beat the Bills by three in the first matchup between these two teams. The bet here is that Buffalo takes better care of the ball this time around and is able to pull out a win behind Josh Allen and a defense that has forced multiple turnovers itself in five of seven games since the bye.  … Prediction: Bills 24, Patriots 21Green Bay Packers (-2.5) at Denver BroncosDajani (Broncos +2.5): \"Fraud Bowl?\" No, I like both of these teams, but I think I like the Broncos more. This Denver defense leads the NFL in yards per play (4.5), third down percentage (31%) and red zone percentage (40%). I truly think Jordan Love is going to have to have his best game of the season to get past the Broncos in Denver. And even if the Broncos get off to a slow start on Sunday, they seemingly always rebound. Denver has a +50-point differential in the fourth quarter this season, which ranks second in the league …  Prediction: Broncos 24, Packers 20Dubin (Packers -2.5): Green Bay has won four in a row and seems to be hitting its stride on both sides of the ball. The passing game has seemingly gotten on track over the last few weeks, and we know what they can do defensively. The Broncos can reach as high a ceiling defensively as any team in the NFL, but they also have a low floor offensively, and I'm not as confident in Bo Nix against the Green Bay pass rush as I am in Jordan Love against Denver's. … Prediction: Pacers 23, Broncos 20\n\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 15 picks and score predictions: Patriots and Broncos both lose, Dolphins shock Steelers\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDetroit Lions at Los Angeles Rams (-5.5)Dajani (Rams -5.5): Talk about a get-right game for L.A. last week. The Rams thumped the hapless Arizona Cardinals, 45-17, following their shocking loss to the Carolina Panthers. Now, Matthew Stafford gets his former team -- who he actually has a losing record against. Most bettors probably think this line is too large, but this Lions defense is down several starters -- including the Pro Bowler Brian Branch, who just tore his Achilles. The Lions are 7-6 ATS compared to the Rams' 9-4 ATS record. It may be a sweat in the fourth quarter, but I'll actually lay the points with the favorites  …  Prediction: Rams 28, Lions 21Dubin (Lions +5.5): The Lions are once again battered by injuries on defense, having just lost Brian Branch for the season last Thursday in addition to the various other players they already had on injured reserve. But their offense is good enough to keep them in any game with any team -- even one as good as the Rams. Jahmyr Gibbs, Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jameson Williams are so explosive that they can overcome some of the issues Detroit might have up front with L.A.'s defensive line. As long as the protection doesn't totally implode, I like Detroit to keep this close.  … Prediction: Rams 30, Lions 26Minnesota Vikings at Dallas Cowboys (-5.5) (SNF)Dajani (Cowboys -5.5): I was very wrong about how the Vikings would fare against the Washington Commanders last week, but we've seen this movie before. Remember when the Vikings went and upset the Lions in Week 9? Everyone thought Minnesota had turned a corner. Then, the Vikings lost four straight with horrific quarterback play. While the Cowboys lost to the Lions in Week 14, they had a mini bye to rest, and are surely rejuvenated by the rival Eagles' overtime loss to the Chargers on \"Monday Night Football.\" To put it simply, Dak Prescott is going to out-score J.J. McCarthy …  Prediction: Cowboys 30, Vikings 23\nDubin (Cowboys -5.5): I know the Vikings just went out and dominated the Commanders, but I'm not sure I can envision a repeat of that offensive performance. It is basically the only time all year that the offense has looked competent, let alone good, and the Dallas defense was looking improved against weaker opponents before getting torn apart by the Lions last week. Minnesota is one of those weaker opponents. I think the Cowboys can score just enough on Minnesota's defense here to keep the Vikings at a distance.  … Prediction: Cowboys 23, Vikings 13Miami Dolphins at Pittsburgh Steelers (-3) (MNF)Dajani (Steelers -3): The Dolphins lead the NFL in scoring defense (13.3 points per game), rushing yards per game (192.3) and turnover differential (+7) during this four-game winning streak, but the only decent team Miami beat was Buffalo in Week 10. The Steelers established some momentum this past week with the win over the Ravens, as controversial as it maybe was, but I'll take the home team in a close contest. The Steelers have a 22-game win streak at home on \"Monday Night Football!\" It's the longest streak all-time  …  Prediction: Steelers 20, Dolphins 14Dubin (Dolphins +3): Did you know that the Dolphins are 5-1 in their last six games since dropping to 1-6 and looking like their season was done? Mike McDaniel has this team playing really well! They can run on anybody, and we've seen that you can run on the Steelers. (Look at what the Bills did a couple weeks ago.) If they can control the game on the ground, I like their chances to pull of an upset here, considering that the Pittsburgh offense still isn't explosive enough to put an opponent away.  … Prediction: Dolphins 21, Steelers 17\n            ",

FAU transfer F Tre Carroll's 30 points was another reminder of the match-winners on Pitino's Musketeers, who have improved 3-point shooting to near 37% after the X was hovering around 25% earlier in the season.  Well-traveled G Richie Anderson III also scored 28 in a recent cruise past St Francis-Pa. Meanwhile, not sure how much progress Cuonzo Martin is making at Mizzou State, as the Bears have taken some lumps away from Springfield, such as the 98-74 loss at Tulsa last Saturday. Cuonzo's team also isn't helping itself with subpar 29.7% shooting beyond the arc.

Here they get a visit from Sean Miller's first Texas team, and while the Longhorns have not faired well against top competition they are athletic enough to do some damage with a well-executed game plan. Speaking of game plan, Miller's Xavier team played UConn tough last year and peeled off a couple wins against the eventual national champs in 2023. This spread considers Texas way too much of a pushover given the spot and the familiarity in the coaching matchup. \n                                    \n            \n    \n\n                    \n                                                                \n\n    \n            \n            \n            \n                Mike Tierney\n            \n            \n                                    \n        \n            +283\n        \n        \n            (71%)\n        \n    \n                \n                                            5-2 in Last 7 NCAAF O/U Picks\n                                    \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                                        \n                    \n                                                    NCAAF\n                                                ARMY @ NAVY • Sat 3:00pm\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                    \n    \n                                                \n                    \n                    \n    \n                                                \n                    \n                                            \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                Over 38.5\n                            \n                            \n                                -110\n                            \n                        \n                                                    \n                                Over/Under\n                            \n                                            \n                \n            \n                            \n                    Picked: Dec 9 @ 12:18am\n                \n                    \n                \n                    Analysis\n                \n                \n                                            Low as it might seem, this total is higher than it's been in several seasons. It is not high enough. Army has picked up the pace on offense, with a No. 67 ranking for snaps per game. Navy has picked up the scoring pace and forged a No. 31 ranking with 32 ppg. Midshipman QB Blake Horvath airs it out 12 times a game and is hitting on 62 percent with nine TDs. The rivals might not have quite entered the 21st century for offense but have booked a departure out of the 20th. Unless the coaches go scared conservative on play-calling, this matchup should easily find the 40s in points. \n                                    \n            \n    \n\n                    \n                                                                \n\n    \n            \n            \n            \n                Thomas Casale\n            \n            \n                                    \n                    \n                                        \n        #3\n    \n                                    \n        \n            +233\n        \n        \n            (62%)\n        \n    \n                \n                                            13-8 in Last 21 NCAAB Picks\n                                    \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                                        \n                    \n                                                    NCAAB\n                                                IND @ UK • Sat 7:30pm\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                    \n    \n                                                \n                    \n                                            \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                UK\n                            \n                            \n                                -125\n                            \n                        \n                                                    \n                                Money Line\n                            \n                                            \n                \n            \n                            \n                    Picked: Dec 11 @ 11:37pm\n                \n                    \n                \n                    Analysis\n                \n                \n                                            BetRivers opened Kentucky -1.5 with the ML -125 for Saturday. Maybe the Wildcats just aren't very good but I'm going to take them here in a buy low spot at home. Indiana has played one true road game and got smacked by a bad Minnesota team. If you can't get this early number, I'm good taking Kentucky up to -3.5. Just make sure four is the cutoff. I don't trust the Cats enough right now to lay more than 3.5. I normally won't release a CBB play unless FD or DK has odds up but I'm going to be traveling on Friday afternoon and probably won't be able to post when more books put out the line. \n                                    \n            \n    \n\n                    \n                                                                \n\n    \n            \n            \n            \n                Alex Selesnick\n            \n            \n                                    \n                    \n                                        \n        #5\n    \n                                    \n        \n            +1104\n        \n        \n            (61%)\n        \n    \n                \n                                            48-31 in Last 79 NFL Player Props Picks\n                                    \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                                        \n                    \n                                                    NFL\n                                                BUF @ NE • Sun 1:00pm\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n        \n        \n                    \n    \n                                                \n                    \n            \n                    \n                                                    \n                                H.

    "body": "\nThe first opportunity to make a Week 15 NFL SGP comes when the Tampa Bay Buccaneers host the Atlanta Falcons on 'Thursday Night Football.' Making NFL picks on the money line could be of interest for some with their TNF SGP, but perhaps there are better options. Not only have these teams split their last 20 meetings, but their all-time series is also evenly split with 32 wins apiece. Thus, your 'Thursday Night Football' same-game parlay may want to rely on NFL player props, spread bets and total predictions.The Over has hit in four of the last five Atlanta games, while it's also hit in three of the last five Tampa games. If interested in prop bets for your NFL same-game parlay, then there are intriguing ones for the likes of Bijan Robinson, Baker Mayfield, Bucky Irving and Mike Evans, who is active but is expected to be on a snap count. Before locking in any Falcons vs. Buccaneers picks for your 'Thursday Night Football' SGP, be sure to see the Buccaneers vs. Falcons prop predictions powered by SportsLine's Machine Learning AI.New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins, on picks like Bucky Irving going over 61.5 rushing yards. Bet it at DraftKings right here:\nBuilt using cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques by SportsLine's Data Science team, AI Predictions and AI Ratings are generated for each player prop. Now, the model has analyzed Buccaneers vs. Falcons on 'Thursday Night Football' and locked in three confident best bets for an NFL SGP. If you successfully parlay its picks, you'd be looking at a payout of almost 7-1. You can only see the Machine Learning Model player prop predictions for Atlanta vs. Tampa Bay here.\nTop 'Thursday Night Football' SGP picksAfter simulating Buccaneers vs. Falcons, SportsLine's Machine Learning Model says Falcons RB Bijan Robinson goes Under 4.5 receptions (+112). Robinson has gone under his receptions bar in four of his last five games, averaging 3.0 receptions over this span. While he's averaging a career high in receptions per game this year, much of that was when Michael Penix Jr. was under center as Robinson has had three or fewer catches in five of the last six games started by Kirk Cousins.Additionally, Tampa has contained running backs in the passing game recently. Only one running back has had more than three receptions versus the Bucs over their last seven games, despite facing the likes of Jahmyr Gibbs and Alvin Kamara over that span. The AI model projects Robinson to have 2.8 receptions. This plus-money NFL prop is rated 4.5 stars and could be a part of a winning Thursday Night Football SGP. See which other TNF same-game parlay picks to make here.You can bet Robinson to go under 4.5 receptions at DraftKings:\nHow to make Falcons vs. Buccaneers SGP picksIn addition, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model has 12 other NFL props that are rated 4 stars or better that could be a part of your Bucs vs. Falcons SGP picks. You can only see the Machine Learning Model's Thursday Night Football NFL parlay at SportsLine.What are the model's top TNF same-game parlay picks you should target with your Falcons vs. Bucs predictions?

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 college football bowl season kicks off on Saturday when Boise State battles Washington in the 2025 LA Bowl at 8 p.m. ET. Over the course of the next five weeks, there will be 46 bowl matchups (including all College Football Playoff games) and the college football bowl schedule includes some stylistically intriguing battles. After being snubbed by the College Football Playoff committee, Notre Dame has chosen not to participate in a bowl, but No. 12 BYU, who was also left out, will play No. 22 Georgia Tech in the Pop-Tarts Bowl on Dec. 27. Other matchups that day include Penn State vs. Clemson (-4.5), UConn vs. Army (-5.5) and LSU vs. Houston (-3.5).BYU is a 4.5-point favorite in the latest college football bowl odds, but will they actually show up motivated after it looks like they weren't given serious consideration for the 12-team playoff? Motivation is always a factor during bowl season and it's something that you'll need to consider as you make your college football bowl confidence picks along with opt-outs, transfer portal news, injuries and many more factors. Before entering any college football bowl confidence pools, be sure to see the college football picks from SportsLine's Thomas Casale.New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins:A frequent guest on national radio and TV shows to discuss college sports, Casale has been sports betting -- and winning -- for more than 30 years.So before filling out your college football pool picks or making any college football bets, you need to see Casale's college football bowl confidence picks.

The Aggies finished 11-1 and 7-1 in the SEC, tying for first place, but missed out on playing in the conference championship after losing at Texas 27-17 on Nov. 28. The Hurricanes, who tied for second with four other teams at 6-2 in the ACC and were 10-2 overall, have won four in a row.Quarterback Marcel Reed helps power the A&M offense. The sophomore has completed 61.8% of his passes for 2,932 yards and 25 touchdowns with 10 interceptions and a 153.2 rating. He has also rushed 89 times for 466 yards (5.2 average) and six touchdowns. In a 38-17 win over No. 22 Missouri on Nov. 8, he completed 20 of 29 passes for 221 yards and two touchdowns. Miami, meanwhile, is led by senior quarterback Carson Beck. He has completed 74.7% of his passes this season for 3,072 yards and 25 touchdowns with 10 interceptions and a 165.8 rating. Beck has also rushed for one score.

The Falcons are coming off a 37-9 defeat to Seattle that eliminated Atlanta from postseason contention. The Bucs, meanwhile, were just upset by New Orleans, 24-20, on Sunday. This rivalry is as even as could be as the teams have split their 64 all-time matchups, 32-32. Mike Evans (collarbone) is active for Tampa, while Cade Otton is inactive. Meanwhile, Atlanta's Kyle Pitts (knee) and first-round rookie Jalon Walker (quad) are both active after being limited in practice during the week. Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from  Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Fla. The Bucs won their Week 1 meeting, 23-20, on the road. Tampa Bay is a 5.5-point favorite at DraftKings in the latest Falcons vs. Buccaneers odds, while the over/under for total points is 43.5. Tampa is at -275 on the money line (risk $275 to win $100), while Atlanta is at +223 (risk $100 to win $223).

Also, Tampa is just 1-5 ATS at home this season. Atlanta's pass rush has come on strong as of late, averaging 4.5 sacks over the last six games, which is also notable in terms of Atlanta covering as the Bucs are 2-5 ATS when Baker Mayfield is sacked multiple times in a game this season. Speaking of Mayfield, his struggles are a big reason for Tampa's recent woes as he has under 200 yards in four straight games, with more turnovers (five) than passing touchdowns (four) over that stretch. See which team to back at SportsLine, and bet Mayfield to go Under 218.5 passing yards at DraftKings here:\nWhy the Buccaneers can coverTampa's defense can take away what Atlanta does best on offense, and that's running the ball. The Bucs have the No. 8 run defense and have contained Bijan Robinson, as he's averaged just 45.5 rushing yards, at under 4.0 yards per carry, over his last four versus Tampa. There's also the motivation factor in this game, as Tampa is tied with Carolina for the NFC South lead, so it has plenty to play for. Meanwhile, the Falcons were eliminated from any postseason possibility last week, which is, perhaps, a reason why they aren't rushing Drake London (knee) back to the field. His absence makes Atlanta's offense even easier to contain as he had more catches (8) than all other Falcons' wideouts combined (6) in their Week 1 loss to Tampa. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Bucs vs. Falcons  picksHartstein has analyzed Falcons vs. Bucs from every angle and he's leaning Under on the point total. He has also discovered a critical X-factor that has him jumping all over one side of the spread.

The Bucs have won six of the last 10 meetings against the Falcons, but Tampa Bay is just 1-4 in its past five games overall. Tampa Bay is favored by 4.5 points at home, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has identified Buccaneers (-4.5) as one of its Thursday best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook for online sports betting. The model is backing Over 222.5 total points in Rockets vs. Clippers, while one of SportsLine's top experts has a pick from No. 4 Iowa State taking on Iowa in a rivalry college basketball matchup. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

The Buccaneers are 1-4 over their last five games, however, three of those losses came to teams in the Super Bowl picture, falling to the Rams, Bills and Patriots. Meanwhile, the Falcons (4-9) are 1-7 over their last eight games and are coming off an ugly 37-9 loss to the Seahawks last week. Kirk Cousins is 37 years old as the current Atlanta QB1, and he's clearly not the quarterback he once was. He'll take the field without Drake London (knee) once again. Meanwhile, Baker Mayfield could have reinforcements his way with wide receivers Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan activated from IR. The model projects Tampa Bay to cover in 51% of simulations. Back Tampa Bay at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Clippers vs. Rockets: Over 222.5 points (-108)Kevin Durant and James Harden, former teammates with two different franchises, go head-to-head on Thursday, with Durant leading the Rockets and Harden spearheading the Clippers. Both teams are having significantly different levels of success this season, but with both teams rested and having not played since Saturday, the model projects these veteran superstars to play significant minutes, which could lead to more scoring for themselves and their teammates. The Rockets are fourth in the league in scoring at 120.9 ppg this season, and the Clippers have allowed at least 107 points in 13 of their last 14 contests. The model projects the Over to hit in 62.9% of simulations. Back the Over at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Iowa vs. Iowa State: Under 143.5 points (-110)\"It's fair to speculate if the Hawkeyes can really keep pace in \"Hoops Cy-Hawk\" after Iowa lost contact vs. Michigan State last week,\" SportsLine legendary expert Bruce Marshall said. \"The task of slowing ISU's offense (better than 94 ppg and hitting north of 54% from the floor) will likely come down to how well Ben McCollum's offense controls pace and tempo, and preventing the Cyclones from deploying their devastating transition game that helped bury top-ranked Purdue last Saturday. Easier said than done, but even if winning the game might be a real stretch for Iowa, McCollum's team can slow the pace as good as any, and with four starters (including star G Bennett Stirtz) hitting better than 50% from the floor, the Hawkeyes can afford to be patient.\" Back the Under at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:\nWant more Thursday Night Football, NBA and college basketball picks?You've seen some of the model's Thursday best bets.

Folliot must also pay a $70,000 fine and return more than $44,000 in corrupt payments. He may not play in, coach in or attend any tennis event authorized by ITIA members or any national association during the ban.An ITIA investigation, which already resulted in discipline for five other players, discovered that Folliot, 26, committed 27 breaches of the Tennis Anti-Corruption Program and was a \"central figure in a network of players operating on behalf of a match-fixing syndicate.\"\nThe time served under the provisional suspension will count toward Folliot's 20-year ban, which will end in May 2044. He will be 44 at the end of the suspension.\nFolliot denied 30 charges stemming from 11 matches between 2022-24, including eight in which he participated. Folliot was charged with contriving the outcome of matches, receiving money to not give best efforts for betting purposes, offering money to other players to fix matches, provision of inside information, conspiracy to corrupt, failure to co-operate with an ITIA investigation and destruction of evidence.Anti-Corruption Hearing Officer Amani Khalifa upheld 27 of the charges in an October hearing and later described Folliot as \"a vector for a wider criminal syndicate, actively recruiting other players and attempting to embed corruption more deeply into the professional tours.\"\nFolliot achieved a career-high world singles ranking of No. 488 in August 2022. He has since fallen to No. 1163 amid a provisional suspension which began in May 2024. Folliot has a 201-156 (.563) singles record for his professional career and is 111-113 (.496) in doubles matches.\n            \n    ",

Part of that is because of the uncertainty of the future for Kyler Murray, Daniel Jones, and other veterans. A bigger issue is how uncertain I still feel about the 2025 rookie class. This last month of the season could go a ways in clarifying that.Cam Ward, the number one pick, has been mostly awful for Fantasy Football in entirely awful circumstances. He showed some life in the middle of the season, but he has now averaged 4.9 yards per pass attempt in his last four games. If he doesn't show something more in this final month, it will be hard to keep him in the top 20.Jaxson Dart has been by far the best rookie QB, but he has also averaged 194 passing yards per game as a starter. Dart produced some insane numbers with his legs, but in his first game back from his concussion, he had a season-low four rush attempts. If Dart's last month looks anything like his first, he is probably a top 12 Dynasty QB in January. If the Giants are more hesitant to call designed runs for him and he isn't more productive as a passer, he may not crack the top 15.This week, we had a one-man mailbag on Fantasy Football Today Dynasty. We talked about the 2026 rookie class and just how valuable those 2026 rookie picks are. Check it out:\nA month ago, this article may have stopped with Dart. But Tyler Shough and Shedeur Sanders have done just enough lately to wonder if they could get a chance to start Week 1 of 2026. Both have more work to do to earn that opportunity, and winning a game or two to harm their draft position wouldn't hurt. Sanders, in particular, has an excellent opportunity to build on last week's 364-yard, 3 TD performance that led the Browns to name him their starter the rest of the season. Both Sanders and Shough will be ranked in January, with the risk that their team adds a QB this offseason. But they could skyrocket in May if they are the QB1 on the roster. Both could be good buys, particularly for rebuilders, but any offer has to factor in the risk that they are a career backup. \nAs always, you can get my weekly updated Dynasty Trade Charts over on SportsLine.

After one fight, however, Hawke realized he wouldn't cut it as a professional fighter. \"I saw 'Rocky' and I decided I wanted to be a boxer,\" Hawke told fellow actor Sydney Sweeney for Variety and CNN's \"Actors on Actors\" series. \"I took boxing lessons. I got one fight, and I didn't like boxing anymore.\"I got my ass kicked. I felt like I was a pretty good  defensive boxer, but the guy was punching my hands so hard that I was  hitting myself. I dropped it. I did not like losing.\" \nHawke fared infinitely better as an actor. His decorated resume includes a Daytime Emmy Award, as well as nominations for four Academy Awards, three Golden Globes, a British Academy Film Award, and a Tony. He came closest to experiencing the boxer lifestyle while portraying an ex-boxer in a 1999 production of Tennessee Williams' experimental play, \"Camino Real.\"Sweeney, who recently played International Boxing Hall of Famer Christy Martin in a biopic, told Hawke she had trained in boxing for roughly six months for the role. \n\"You fared better than I did,\" Hawke told Sweeney, the latter of whom suffered a concussion on set.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Before the 2025 Heisman Trophy winner is revealed on Saturday, the Heisman Trust unveiled the results for the players that finished fifth through 10th in this year's voting. Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love, Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza, Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia and Ohio State quarterback Julian Sayin were announced Monday as finalists for college football's most prestigious individual award. Those four will be on hand for the Heisman ceremony in New York City on Saturday. The players who just missed the cut are Texas Tech linebacker Jacob Rodriguez, who finished fifth ahead of Ohio State wide receiver Jeremiah Smith (sixth), Georgia quarterback Gunner Stockton (seventh), Ole Miss quarterback Trinidad Chambliss (eighth), Ohio State safety Caleb Downs (ninth), and Georgia Tech quarterback Haynes King, who finished 10th.\n        \n            \n                Heisman Trophy finalists 2025: Fernando Mendoza, Diego Pavia, Jeremiyah Love, Julian Sayin headed to New York\n                \n                    Will Backus                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nRodriguez, who won the Bronko Nagurski Trophy for the nation's top defender, heads the Red Raiders' monstrous defense.

The Red Raiders are the No. 4 seed and have a first-round bye in the College Football Playoff. \nSmith won Big Ten Receiver of the Year for the second consecutive season, and Downs won both Defensive Player of the Year and Defensive Back of the Year for the conference. No. 2 Ohio State is the first team to have three top-10 Heisman finishers in the same year since 2020, when Alabama had DeVonta Smith (who won the award), Mac Jones and Najee Harris.Stockton led No. 3 Georgia to its second straight SEC Championship Game victory. He has thrown 23 touchdown passes and just five interceptions, the third-best ratio in the SEC. Chambliss led the SEC in that metric, firing 18 touchdown passes and just three interceptions for an Ole Miss offense that leads the Power Four in yards per game.King was one of the game's best dual-threat quarterbacks, throwing for 12 touchdowns and rushing for 15 more. He was the only player to reach double digits in both categories this season.\nThe Heisman Trophy will be presented Saturday night in New York.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        FRISCO, Texas -- Dallas Cowboys wide receiver CeeDee Lamb cleared concussion protocol on Thursday, which is how he was able to be a full practice participant ahead of Dallas' \"Sunday Night Football\" matchup with the Minnesota Vikings in Week 15. Lamb is now tracking toward a return to football 10 days after suffering a concussion on \"Thursday Night Football\" at the Detroit Lions in Week 14. His brain injury occurred when his head slammed into the Ford Field turf on an end zone target in which he attempted to make an acrobatic, one-handed catch. Lamb exhibited a fencing response in the immediate aftermath of his concussive blow to the head as his hands and fingers began to make unnatural movements. Despite that moment and it being brought up to Lamb that Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Tee Higgins went right back into concussion protocol in Week 14 against the Buffalo Bills in his first game back from a concussion, he doesn't have any apprehension about the 10-day turnaround from his concussion to his return. \"Man, nah, in a situation like that, bro, as far as getting hurt or getting a concussion, it's not like you're thinking about, 'Oh, what if? What if I get hurt again?' I feel like if you live in that realm and you feed that fuel, it's going to happen,\" Lamb said after practice on Thursday. \"You don't want to live in a realm like that's never going to happen again. Really, it's [about] staying level, just being positive about each and every opportunity you get and just staying blessed. You have to go out there first and play your game and don't really think too much on it. I've been hurt a couple times and I don't dwell on it. I hit my head a couple of times. I don't dwell on it. You have to move on. It's a part of the game. That's why playing football is very important, and that's why taking care of your body is even more important.\"\n\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 15 viewer's guide: Top 10 things to watch, including Super Bowl contenders and Philip Rivers comeback\n                \n                    Douglas Clawson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDallas quarterback Dak Prescott immediately ran up to Lamb on the field in Detroit in the immediate aftermath of the concussion, which is when saw his top target's initial fencing response. That was a cause for immediate concern in the 10-year veteran's eyes, but Prescott isn't worried about Lamb's return on Sunday against the Vikings 10 days later after seeing how he's practiced. \"Yeah, zero concern. Obviously on the field, you see a guy whatever they call that, his hands getting into that formation [a fencing response] right? Whether it's your brother, teammate or somebody on the other team, you don't want to see that. So yeah, obviously there was some urgency to get him help then, but then actually when I got over there, he was almost right back to it. I was like 'you good?' He's like 'yeah,'\" Prescott said Thursday. \"You just could tell just for a moment [that Lamb was out of it]. He was back at it Monday, doing light stuff and working out. From there, I was positive in the way that he would respond, and he's been great.\"The 26-year-old All-Pro claims he hasn't suffered from any residual effects or symptoms regarding the concussion, which is why he's confident in being able to play without concern on Sunday night after completing the protocol.  \n\"Process has been cool. Obviously, it's been a lot of eye work and eye discipline and trying to, I guess, frustrate myself essentially to see if I have any more residuals of the concussion. And I haven't had any type of symptoms,\" Lamb said. \"As for me now, it's been heavy on rest, to be honest. Doing everything, me knowing my requirements, kind of getting ahead of everything, especially with the extra 2-3 days that we had off. I feel like that was big.\"Hard Knocks' latest episode on Tuesday showed Lamb begging trainers to keep him in the game while being helped off the field with him saying \"Let me play.\" When the injury happened early in the third quarter of an eventual 44-30 Dallas defeat, Lamb was on fire with 121 yards receiving on six catches. He claims to \"remember everything\" from when he suffered his concussion, which is why he asked the training staff to let him play. However, Lamb acknowledged this instance was one where he needed to be protected from himself. \"They're doing their job, and obviously me as a competitor, I want to do mine. But it's times where they do have to protect me from me. That was the situation to where that was one of them. I felt like I was having a pretty good game,\" Lamb said. \"I was just kind of getting started and getting it cooking. ... But again I'm happy for the training staff. I'm happy for everybody that's reached out. ... It was a surreal moment for me and myself and really just a quick experience. It was an opportunity for me to grow up. ... Overall, just always be grateful for each and every opportunity I can step out there.\"\nAs a result, Lamb has been practicing with the Guardian cap over his helmet in practice this week, something he said he had been doing since switching to a new helmet recently. However, he won't be wearing it during game action like Green Bay Packers wide receiver Romeo Doubs does for a simple reason. \"It's not comfortable,\" Lamb said. \nWith just 135 yards receiving across Dallas' final four games, Lamb will join Pro Football Hall of Famer Michael Irvin (1991-1995) as the only players in Cowboys history with 1,000 yards receiving in five consecutive seasons. At 6-6-1, Dallas will need much more than that total from Lamb over the next four weeks to somehow backdoor their way into the postseason. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 FIFA men's World Cup is approaching next year, and qualifying is well underway with more than half of the spots now accounted for. There are now 48 teams after FIFA decided to expand from the old 32-team format that had been in place since the 1998 World Cup. The 2026 edition will take place in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, kicking off on June 11, 2026, at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City, and will end on July 19 at MetLife Stadium in New York City.With the tournament's expansion, the European confederation (UEFA) is guaranteed 16 slots of the 48 teams, while the African confederation (CAF) has nine, and the Asian confederation (AFC) has eight. There will also be a minimum of six each from South America (CONMEBOL) and the Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football (Concacaf). On top of this, for the first time in history, the Oceania Football Confederation (OFC) has one guaranteed slot, while the remaining two spots will be decided through intercontinental playoffs.Three teams have already secured qualification to the first men's World Cup in their history. Uzbekistan, Jordan, and Cabo Verde will all be at the World Cup for the first time, and more first-timers could join them as the dust settles. With a population of 524,877, Cabo Verde became the second-smallest nation to ever qualify for the World Cup, behind only Iceland, which had a population of 350,000 when they qualified for the 2018 World Cup.Let's take a look at who has already booked their tickets to the World Cup:Already qualified for the 2026 World CupWorld Cup hostsSince the 2026 World Cup is co-hosted by three nations, they all receive an automatic qualifying spot in the tournament. United StatesMexicoCanadaAFC QualifiersIranUzbekistanSouth KoreaJordanAustraliaJapanQatarSaudi ArabiaOFC QualifierNew ZealandCONMEBOL Qualifiers\nArgentinaBrazilEcuadorParaguayUruguayCAF QualifiersMoroccoEgyptTunisiaGhanaCabo VerdeAlgeriaSouth AfricaSenegalIvory CoastUEFA qualifiersEnglandFranceCroatiaPortugal Norway Germany Netherlands Chaos in UEFATeams such as England, Portugal, France and Croatia booked their place in the World Cup, as the winners of each qualifying group will head directly to the tournament. But the second-placed team in each group will head to a playoff phase, such as Italy that might miss their third World Cup in a row. Those 12 second-placed teams will be joined by the four best UEFA Nations League group winners.That second round will see 16 teams drawn into four paths with two rounds of single-match playoffs that will lead to a final with the four overall path winners heading to the World Cup. Due to that process, no UEFA teams will take part in the inter-confederation playoffs. These also won't conclude until March of 2026.Who makes the inter-confederation playoffs?The final World Cup participants won't be determined until March of 2026, following the draw for the World Cup groups. A playoff will take place in North America in March, including one team each from the following regions: AFC, CAF, CONMEBOL, OFC, alongside two from Concacaf to determine the final two places in the World Cup. The bottom four teams in the FIFA World Rankings will be drawn into two single-elimination matches, where the winner will advance to face the top two teams in the rankings, with the winners of those two matches qualifying for the World Cup. Currently in the inter-confederation playoffs\nCAF: DR CongoOFC: New CaledoniaCONMEBOL: BoliviaWhen is the World Cup draw?Paths to the World Cup final will be revealed on Dec. 5 in a ceremony taking place at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.. At that time, teams will know what groups they will be drawn into, and while the final teams will still need to be determined, placeholders will be used for their spots in the draw.  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Every dynasty must eventually come to an end. We're not quite there with the Kansas City Chiefs, who've appeared in each of the last three Super Bowls, plus five of the last six. But plenty are fairly wondering if the perennial contenders might finally be slowing down. Sunday's loss to the rival Denver Broncos, after all, didn't just mark an unusual drop to .500 for the once-vaunted Chiefs, but a potential forfeiture of the entire AFC West.Losers of two straight thanks to Week 10's defeat at the hands of Bo Nix and the Broncos, the Chiefs are now squarely in third place in a division they've owned for the better part of the last decade. A 10th straight West title isn't impossible, but it feels increasingly like a fantasy as Denver (9-2) touts a formidable defense and the Los Angeles Chargers (7-4) boast at least a small cushion of their own in the wild-card race.How bad are things in Kansas City, really? Is the 5-5 start truly an indication the Chiefs are in trouble? Should Arrowhead faithful be concerned about the team's chances of even returning to the playoffs? Let's unpack.Do the Chiefs still have a shot at winning the AFC West? The AFC? The Super Bowl? Place your wager at FanDuel and get $150 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager.\nWhat's wrong with the Chiefs?You don't go 5-5 without a slew of issues -- some big, some small, often crossing over and compounding. But the chief concern (pun intended) in Kansas City is this: They're just not finishing. It's an odd thing to say about the Chiefs, considering coach Andy Reid's AFC powerhouse has basically been synonymous with clutch endings. But after going 11-0 in one-score games in 2024, this group is a deflating 0-5 in the same scenario this year.That doesn't fall on one person. Rather, it speaks to the streakiness of the entire operation. Patrick Mahomes has rediscovered his eye for the deep ball. He's also completing passes at a lower rate (64.5%) than at any other point in his career as a starter. Rashee Rice, Tyquan Thornton and others have flashed with splash plays. Yet 36-year-old Travis Kelce is the only player with more than 40 catches. Meanwhile, on special teams, longtime kicker Harrison Butker already has more combined field goal or extra-point misses (7) than he did a year ago.\n        \n            \n                Patrick Mahomes shoulders blame after Chiefs' 22-19 loss to Broncos damages playoff hopes: 'Starts with me'\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhat happened? What changed?The Chiefs' 2024 season should've been a clue that this was coming. And maybe even the 2023 season before that. Look, we're not going to pretend Kansas City didn't end up in the Super Bowl in both of those campaigns (and win one of them!). But the Chiefs' title contention of the last few years was so incredible in part because it felt so unsustainable. Once a rip-roaring video-game attack under Reid's direction, the Mahomes-led offense has lately relied more on interchangeable parts -- and Mahomes' crunch-time savviness, plus Spagnuolo's similarly clutch defense -- to win on the margins rather than explosively dominate opposing teams.\nThe problem is, the margins are still razor-thin, and the Chiefs haven't risen from \"really scrappy\" to \"genuinely special.\" Mahomes is Mahomes on most Sundays. But his ground support consists of an aging Kareem Hunt and oft-bruised Isiah Pacheco sharing touches, or Mahomes himself scooting off to run it himself. Reid's unit is still controlling the ball reasonably well, but the ball movement remains quite scattershot, as it was for much of the last two seasons, when Mahomes was forced to spread the rock to countless fill-in wideouts. Spagnuolo's \"D,\" meanwhile, still registers as a top-10 unit but isn't applying a ton of pressure or forcing many turnovers.There have been exceptions, yes, like this year's rout of the Detroit Lions. But there have been contrasting examples, too, like Super Bowl LIX, when the Chiefs' makeshift protection for Mahomes finally got exposed against a stellar defensive front and the Philadelphia Eagles rendered K.C. all but uncompetitive on the big stage. As ESPN's Bill Barnwell suggests, the 2025 Chiefs aren't all that different from the 2024 Chiefs, who finished 15-2, in terms of pure production ... but that's partly the issue: how much that group depended on last-gasp heroics.What can be fixed?For one, the Chiefs might consider curbing their appetite for the home run play. Everyone would rather watch Mahomes chuck it downfield, No. 15 included, but only six quarterbacks are throwing deep balls at a higher rate than Kansas City's three-time champion. As a result, the efficiency just isn't there. It may be boring, but without a proper run game, the Chiefs almost need the more conservative Mahomes to chip away at opposing clubs rather than risk surrendering the ball or setting up third-and-longs by looking for the kill shot too soon. Look no further than the Eagles who routed the Chiefs in the last Super Bowl; Jalen Hurts may be a consistent subject of debate for his un-pretty passing marks, but the one thing he excels at is controlling the ball en route to steady victory.\nIt's also much easier said than done, but juicing up the run game would also go a long way toward balancing the Chiefs' attack. Hunt and Pacheco are what they are. Is there any way for Reid to creatively integrate Brashard Smith or even Elijah Mitchell, the club's reserve ball carriers, as larger pieces of the puzzle? Or double down on the gadget-style touches for speedsters like Rice and Xavier Worthy? There is likely no magic door for K.C. to identify a workhorse in the mold of, say, the Eagles' Saquon Barkley of last season. But they need to try.The best \"solution,\" however, just might be the upcoming slate for the Chiefs, which bodes well for a quick turnaround in the standings.Chiefs' remaining 2025 scheduleWeekOpponentRecord12vs. Colts8-213@ Cowboys3-5-114vs. Texans5-515vs. Chargers7-416@ Titans1-917vs. Broncos9-218@ Raiders2-7Indianapolis is currently ranked atop the AFC, and there's certainly a scenario where the dynamic Jonathan Taylor leads the Colts over the Chiefs, but Daniel Jones has proven shakier under center as of late. Dallas, meanwhile, is still working through a defensive transition after struggling mightily to slow the pass to open the year. Including the Cowboys, in fact, four of the Chiefs' final six opponents have a non-winning record. And three of them are inside the AFC West, giving Mahomes and Co. a legitimate chance to even things up in the division race.There are complicating factors, of course, No. 1 being that three of the AFC teams ahead of the Chiefs in the wild-card picture -- the Chargers, Buffalo Bills and Jacksonville Jaguars -- would own a head-to-head tiebreaker after beating K.C. earlier this year. But then the question becomes, do we trust teams like the Chargers and Jaguars to actually finish ahead of the Chiefs, however uneven they may be, come January? We tend to think that if the Chiefs continue to hang around their games as they have, that record in one-score contests will change in a hurry. Accordingly, here's our prediction for how the rest of their 2025 season will unfold:Projection for Chiefs' remaining gamesGamePredictionRecordWeek 12 vs. ColtsW, 26-216-5Week 13 @ CowboysW, 28-227-5Week 14 vs. TexansL, 24-207-6Week 15 vs. ChargersW, 24-218-6Week 16 @ TitansW, 31-109-6Week 17 vs. BroncosW, 25-2210-6Week 18 @ RaidersW, 34-711-6An 11-6 finish would likely put the Chiefs on the edge of the wild-card picture, but we like their odds of sneaking past the Jaguars, if not also the Chargers, to return to the postseason for the 11th straight year under Reid.\n            ",

Denver has ripped off eight straight victories, seven of those being one-score games.Thanks to a nasty defense, one that leads the league in sacks with 49, and timely fourth-quarter play by Bo Nix and the offense, the Broncos have staked a claim as one of the league's best teams.In his third season with the Broncos, coach Sean Payton has Denver as a real Super Bowl threat. The offense may be inconsistent at times, but that defense is special.\nAnd we know the old adage: Defense travels in the postseason -- and this one might not need to hit the road until the Super Bowl if it gets the top seed in the AFC.The Broncos' two losses came on field goals in the final seconds early in the season. Turning that around and winning close games is a great way to prepare for the postseason. They are battle-tested.The Broncos are now up to fifth in my Power Rankings this week as they head into the bye. After the bye, their schedule has road games against the Washington Commanders and Las Vegas Raiders, then home games against Green Bay and Jacksonville before finishing up at Kansas City and home against the Chargers. The last four will decide if they are the top seed in the AFC.\nWe know Nix has been inconsistent at times and the running game needs to be better, but Payton has this team believing in the fourth quarter that they can win games, even when behind. That, coupled with the dominant defense, will make them a threat come playoff time to win it all.They've played the last three games without reigning Defensive Player of the Year cornerback Patrick Surtain II. He is expected back after the bye, which will make them even better.If you didn't believe in this team before Sunday, you should now.

The Cowboys will visit the Raiders on Monday Night Football. The Cowboys are averaging 29.2 points per game this season, including scoring at least 27 in four of their last six games. Meanwhile, the Raiders have been held to seven points or fewer in two of their last three games. The offensive discrepancies are why the SportsLine Projection Model is backing the Cowboys to cover as 3.5-point favorites as one of its Monday best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook. The over/under for Cowboys vs. Raiders is 49.5 points, according to the latest NFL odds. The model also sees value in playing the Clippers to cover as 5.5-point underdogs against the 76ers in NBA action. Also, one of SportsLine's top experts has a best bet on Oilers vs. Sabres in the NHL. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins, plus 3 months of NBA League Pass free: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

Las Vegas has the No. 20 scoring defense (24.4 ppg allowed), and the Raiders have allowed at least 30 points in two of their last three games. Meanwhile, the model doesn't project the Raiders to be able to keep pace with Dallas' offense, whether the Cowboys are at their best or just average, as the Raiders rank 31st in scoring at 15.4 ppg this year. The model projects the Cowboys to cover in 57% of simulations. Back the Dallas at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Clippers (+5.5) vs. 76ers (-112)The Clippers have been hit hard with injuries this season, but so have the 76ers. Philadelphia will be without Joel Embiid (knee) and Kelly Oubre Jr. (knee). Paul George (knee) is questionable. The Clippers were hoping for a Big Three this year of James Harden, Kawhi Leonard and Bradley Beal, but Beal is out for the season with a hip injury, and Leonard has played just six games while dealing with a foot injury. Harden has done his part, though, averaging 26 points and nine assists per game this season, with Ivica Zubac adding 16.2 points and 10.6 rebounds per game. Harden is averaging 39 points over his last two games, and the Clippers went 1-1 with their loss coming by three points over that span. Meanwhile, the 76ers have lost two of their last three games and haven't covered a 5.5-point spread in any of their last three games. The model projects the Clippers to cover in 67% of simulations. Back the Clippers at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Sabres (+1.5) vs. Oilers (-198) \"Bit of a trap game potential for Edmonton after winning a possible Cup Finals preview on Saturday at Carolina and then with Alex Ovechkin and the Caps up next.\" SportsLine expert Matt Severance said. \"The Oilers are 4-6-2 away. Buffalo is last in the Atlantic Division but 5-3-2 at home and off one of the team's better efforts of the year on Saturday in Detroit. The return of captain and blueliner Rasmus Dahlin, a former No. 1 overall pick, from a personal leave made an obvious difference in that huge comeback win.\" Back the Sabres at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:\nWant more Monday Night Football, NBA, NHL picks?You've seen some of the model's Monday best bets.

    "body": "\n        Following a Week 10 slate in the NFL that felt as though it were straight out of an alternate dimension, the league had more chalky results in Week 11. Miami's performance over the past two weeks may be working the franchise out of quarterback range if it elects to move on from Tua Tagovailoa. The Dolphins' latest victory came at the expense of Washington, which is back in top 10 overall projection after a trip to the NFC Championship game. Looking ahead, there are two games involving opponents currently in position to pick in the top 10: Browns at Raiders and Falcons at Saints -- the latter being the first of two meetings between the teams this season. As a reminder, there are four teams -- Atlanta, Green Bay, Indianapolis and Jacksonville -- without a first-round pick in 2026 as a result of draft-day trades and the Micah Parsons and Sauce Gardner deals.\nHere is the current 2026 NFL Draft order, per Tankathon, as well as potential team needs:1. Tennessee Titans (1-9)Projected needs: OT, IOL, WR, DL, EDGETennessee scored a touchdown late to push Houston to the brink of overtime, but Davis Mills executed a drive that set up a last-second game-winning field goal. The Titans remain the league's only one-win team. 2. New York Giants (2-9)Projected needs: WR, CB, IOL, LB, OTJameis Winston brought some much-needed energy after losing Jaxson Dart to a concussion. New York had an early lead and didn't go down without a fight, but ultimately succumbed to the Packers. \n3. Cleveland Browns (2-8)Projected needs: OT, WR, QB, CB, IOLCleveland's defense did everything in its power to give the team a chance to win this game, but the offense was limited with Dillon Gabriel and even more so when Shedeur Sanders was forced into action. A meaningful game, in relation to the draft order, against the Raiders is on the docket for next week. 4. New Orleans Saints (2-8)Projected needs: CB, S, DL, RB, WRNew Orleans was on a bye this week after winning in Week 10. 5. New York Jets (2-8)Projected needs: QB, WR, DL, CB, TEJustin Fields and the Jets jumped out to an early lead on Thursday Night Football, but the Patriots eventually pulled away.6. Las Vegas Raiders (2-8)Projected needs: CB, LB, S, DL, OTLas Vegas was no match for the Cowboys in a 33-16 loss on \"Monday Night Football.\"\n7. Washington Commanders (3-8)Projected needs: EDGE, LB, CB, TE, WRIt was Marcus Mariota under center for the Commanders in Spain. They continue to fall out of the playoff picture a year after appearing in the NFC Championship Game. 8. Los Angeles Rams via Atlanta Falcons (3-7)Projected needs: CB, OT, LB, S, IOLLos Angeles' pick from Atlanta continues to rise as the Falcons suffered an overtime loss to the Panthers on Sunday.9. Cincinnati Bengals (3-7)Projected needs: IOL, CB, S, TE, EDGECincinnati was without Joe Burrow, but Pittsburgh would be without Aaron Rodgers by the end of the afternoon. Burrow is slated to make his anticipated return on Thanksgiving or shortly thereafter, but the Bengals may be too far out of the hunt.\n10. Arizona Cardinals (3-7)Projected needs: OT, IOL, LB, DL, RBJacoby Brissett completed an NFL-record 47 passes on Sunday against the 49ers to little avail. San Francisco nearly doubled them up at home.11. Miami Dolphins (4-7)Projected needs: CB, WR, TE, IOL, SMiami has won back-to-back games for the first time this season. Once perceived to be dead in the water, the Dolphins have life in the wake of general manager Chris Grier's dismissal. 12. Minnesota Vikings (4-6)Projected needs: LB, CB, S, DL, RBJ.J. McCarthy and Caleb Williams each completed exactly 50% of their pass attempts Sunday. McCarthy led a late scoring drive to take the lead, but the Vikings defense surrendered a late scoring drive of their own.\n13. Dallas Cowboys (4-5-1)Projected needs: S, LB, EDGE, RB, CBDefensive tackle Quinnen Williams made a huge impact in his Cowboys debut, helping Dallas secure a blowout victory.14. Baltimore Ravens (5-5)Projected needs: EDGE, DL, IOL, TE, CBCleveland played Baltimore close but was swept by its division rival in the regular season. Baltimore has now worked its way back to .500 after starting the season 1-5.15. Kansas City Chiefs (5-5)Projected needs: DL, RB, CB, LB, TETravis Kelce willed his way into the end zone late against Denver, but the Broncos responded with a last-second field goal to win the game.\n16. Houston Texans (5-5)Projected needs: IOL, OT, TE, DL, SThe Texans are back to .500 on the season having won three of their past four games. Davis Mills was once again at quarterback, and Houston needed a last-second field goal to escape the Titans. 17. Carolina Panthers (6-5)Projected needs: CB, S, IOL, WR, DLCarolina needed a late touchdown from Bryce Young to Tetairoa McMillan to send the game into overtime. There, the Panthers kicked a field goal to secure their fifth win over the past seven.18. Detroit Lions (6-4)Projected needs: EDGE, DL, LB, CB, OTDetroit drops to third in the NFC North after getting shut down by the Eagles on \"Sunday Night Football.\" \n19. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (6-4)Projected needs: LB, DL, EDGE, IOL, TEThe AFC East has been unkind to Tampa Bay over the past two weeks. The Buccaneers went 0-2 after being competitive in both games. 20. Cleveland Browns via Jacksonville Jaguars (6-4)Projected needs: OT, WR, QB, CB, IOLJacksonville's game against Los Angeles was important to its playoff odds. The Jaguars scored early and continued to pile on for a convincing, morale-building victory.21. Pittsburgh Steelers (6-4)Projected needs: QB, DL, WR, CB, IOLTight end Darnell Washington and the Steelers offense ran through a vulnerable Cincinnati defense. It was an important win for Pittsburgh knowing that Baltimore is gaining in the rearview mirror. \n22. Los Angeles Chargers (7-4)Projected needs: IOL, EDGE, CB, TE, DLThe Chargers were a no-show in what amounted to a midseason playoff game. The offensive line has been ravaged by injuries, but the franchise has to find a way to pull out some wins.23. San Francisco 49ers (7-4)Projected needs: OT, IOL, DL, WR, TEBrock Purdy returned to the starting lineup for Kyle Shanahan's offense, but it was the George Kittle show. The veteran tight end had two touchdowns against division rival Arizona.  24. Dallas Cowboys via Green Bay Packers (6-3-1)Projected needs: S, LB, EDGE, RB, CBMalik Willis had to come into the game for Jordan Love at one point against a Giants team that was also without its starting quarterback. Jordan Love was able to play most of this game, but it was a rushing attack by committee that pushed Green Bay over the top. \n25. Chicago Bears (7-3)Projected needs: DL, S, IOL, RB, OTIt was not exactly an explosive day for either offense, but the Bears continue to win games they would have found a way to lose in the past.   26. Buffalo Bills (7-3)Projected needs: S, LB, EDGE, CB, WRBuffalo's game against Tampa Bay was much closer than the final score suggested.

Los Angeles Rams (8-2)Projected needs: CB, OT, LB, S, IOLKyren Williams nearly had as many rushing yards as Matthew Stafford had passing, but the Rams didn't need to do much more than protect the football against Seattle. 30. New England Patriots (9-2)Projected needs: OT, TE, WR, LB, EDGEDrake Maye and the Patriots continue to take care of business against lesser foes. An easy schedule continues the rest of the season.31. Philadelphia Eagles (8-2)Projected needs: TE, CB, EDGE, S, IOLPhiladelphia retains the No. 1 seed in the NFC over the Rams with a dominating defensive effort against Detroit.32. Denver Broncos (9-2)Projected needs: LB, TE, S, WR, OTIt has not always been pretty for the Broncos this season, but they have positioned themselves as well as any other team in the AFC.

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The Seattle Mariners have re-signed first baseman Josh Naylor to a five-year contract on the free-agent market, the club announced on Monday. The deal will be worth $92.5 million and includes a no-trade clause, according to FanSided. This marks the first major free-agent signing of the offseason. Naylor, 28, is coming off a 2025 season in which he slashed .295/.353/.462 in a combined 147 games for the Diamondbacks and Mariners. Seattle acquired Naylor from Arizona leading up to the trade deadline. After the trade, Naylor had an OPS+ of 138 in 54 regular-season games for the Mariners en route to their winning the American League West title for the first time since 2001. Naylor in the ALCS batted .417 with three home runs. The Mariners lost that series in seven games to the Toronto Blue Jays.Naylor in 2024 as a member of the Guardians earned his first and thus far only All-Star selection. For his career, he owns an OPS+ of 116 with a WAR of 8.4 over parts of seven MLB seasons. \nComing into the offseason, CBS Sports ranked Naylor as the No. 23 available free agent in the class. Here's part of R.J. Anderson's write-up: To oppose Naylor is to grow weary of his excitable, borderline vexatious qualities. To embrace him is to grow appreciative of his skilled offensive game, particularly against righties. Naylor has a knack for squaring up the ball that, when combined with his strength and pull-and-lift tendencies, enables him to launch 20ish home runs annually. It's to be seen if his next employer lets him run as freely as the Mariners did, but even if not he should remain a worthy most-days option at the cold corner. Seattle this winter is aiming for as much roster continuity as possible as they remain in contending mode. \"Same goals, same priorities,\" general manager Justin Hollander told reporters at the recent GM meetings in Las Vegas. \"I think No. 1 for us is ideally keeping as much of the group that we had last year, that we really believed in, together. And then filling in the rest of the roster as required.

    "body": "\n        The San Antonio Spurs announced star big man Victor Wembanyama will miss time with a left calf strain suffered in a loss to the Warriors on Friday night. Wembanyama sat out the Spurs' win over the Kings on Sunday night and is now expected to be out of action for at least a few weeks, per Shams Charania. A firm timetable for his return was not provided, but the San Antonio Express-News reports he will be re-evaluated in two or three weeks.   Wembanyama has gotten off to a phenomenal start to his third season in the league, averaging 26.2 points, 12.9 rebounds, 4.0 assists, 3.6 blocks and 1.1 steals per game on 50.2/34.5/85.7 shooting splits. Thanks to Wembanyama's emergence as one of the game's most dominant two-way figures, the Spurs have raced out to a 9-4 record and sit in fifth place in the Western Conference.If he were to miss three weeks of action, that would mean Wembanyama would be out for 10 games. For a player who became the early yet heavy favorite to win Defensive Player of the Year and put himself at least in the conversation for Most Valuable Player, a 10-game absence would leave him with little margin to fulfill the NBA's new 65-game requirement for major individual awards. \nWembanyama would only be able to miss seven additional games the remainder of the season to retain award eligibility. Given teams generally ease players back into action after calf strains -- limit the number of back-to-backs they play -- his awards candidacy could be in serious jeopardy. Thunder big man Chet Holmgren (+130) moved into being the new DPOY favorite at FanDuel, with Wembanyama (+400) sliding to second with the news of his injury. On the court, the Spurs will have to lean on De'Aaron Fox, Stephon Castle and their talented backcourt in Wembanyama's absence. San Antonio's performance against Sacramento offered a glimpse into how they can still find success without Wembanyama, pushing the tempo and leaning on their offensive talent without their defensive anchor on the floor. Luke Kornet got the start at center against the Kings and veteran Kelly Olynyk moved into the backup role. The Spurs will have two more home games to figure out their plan without Wembanyama before a heavy road stretch with six of their next seven games away from San Antonio, including difficult matchups with Denver, Minnesota, Orlando and Cleveland. \nvs. Grizzliesvs. Hawksat Sunsat Blazersat Nuggetsat Timberwolvesvs. Grizzliesat Magic at CavaliersOnly 1.5 games separate the Spurs in fifth from the Suns in eighth in the West, and the next few weeks will be a serious early season challenge for Mitch Johnson's group in learning how to handle adversity without their star. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Usually, the most interesting moves of the offseason are the ones where a player changes teams. Preferably, unexpectedly, with a dramatic change in circumstances that necessitates a wholesale re-evaluation of that player's outlook. John Naylor's return to the Mariners is a rare exception. Seattle's is an extremely pitcher-friendly home park, and some players – *cough Eugenio Suarez *cough* – seem completely overwhelmed by the park's offense-suppressing ways. A premier free agent signing with the Mariners is usually the kind of move that requires a big downgrade in the Fantasy rankings, or at least a sincere reappraisal of that player's value. But in Naylor's case, that might not be so. As a hitter, Naylor more than held his own in Seattle, hitting .299/.341/.490 in 54 games after he was traded there last summer, and while that's an awfully small sample size to go on, it's a compelling one. Naylor is a rare hitting talent; he's not necessarily an elite hitter with tremendous traits, or anything like that. No, what makes Naylor so special is that he's an endlessly adaptable hitter. He has a good approach at the plate and has really strong contact skills, but he also has more than enough power that pitchers can't just attack the zone with fastballs and dare him to do something with them. He'll take a walk, but he isn't hunting them; he'll dump a homer into the right field bleachers, but it's not all he's trying to do; he'll dump a single the other way, but it's not his goal every time he gets up there. It's a skill set that has allowed him to thrive in Cleveland, Arizona, and now Seattle, where he has hit .304/.335/.534 in 163 career plate appearances.\nGreat, so Naylor is the same guy he's always been, right? Uh, yeah, not so much. Along with his move to Seattle last summer was one of the most unexpected skill changes I've ever seen: Naylor suddenly became an elite baserunner. Naylor's never been a zero on the basepaths, stealing as many as 10 bases in 2023 despite being a slow baserunner. He was more active than usual before the trade to Seattle, swiping 11 in 93 games, but once he landed with the Mariners, he became one of the most prolific base stealers in the game. In those 54 games, he managed to swipe 19 bases without being caught stealing even once. And if you thought maybe he was just taking advantage of a lack of defensive attention in the dog days of summer – many of his steals came without even a cursory throw to second – he also stole two bases in 12 postseason games. Okay, that isn't quite the 60-steal pace he was on with the Mariners in the regular season, but it's a sign that he wasn't shy, either. And, in case you're wondering if Naylor might be, let's say, \"sneaky fast\" … nope! He was in the third percentile in sprint speed last season, by far the slowest player to steal 30 bases in the Statcast era – the second slowest was Juan Soto in 2025, who was in the 13th percentile, and before that it was Kyle Tucker in 2023, who was in the 33rd percentile. Naylor was extremely slow. Slower than any player who has stolen this many bases since at least 2015. \nHow did he manage those steals? Well, he got great jumps, predictably; among 226 players with at least 500 stolen base opportunities, only 12 gained more distance between when the pitcher began their delivery and when they released the ball, per StatCast data. Of the names ahead of him, only Agustin Ramirez was a base stealer of any renown. Naylor was incredibly opportunistic, but it's not like it is reflected in the rest of his baserunning stats. Taking his overall baserunning exploits into account, Statcast has him just about as an average baserunner in 2025. That was a big improvement from 2024, but it still highlights the fact that Naylor didn't actually become an incredible baserunner overnight – he just got a lot better at the one part of baserunning we care about for Fantasy.Is that a projectable skill moving forward? My guess is now, and that we'll see a similar regression with Naylor as we saw from Willy Adames a year ago – he stole 21 bases in his contract year in 2024 before falling back to 12 in 2025. That was still the second-highest mark of his career, but it was much more in line with what he had done before. For Naylor, that would imply something like 15 steals as a reasonable expectation, which would be a nice bonus for an otherwise only pretty good hitting first baseman, but not a difference-making number.\nBut with his return to Seattle … maybe that's underselling him? I don't think you should draft Naylor in 2026, expecting him to be a 30-steal guy again, but I would have said there was basically no chance of a repeat if he landed somewhere else. In Seattle, where he was, again, on a near-30-steal pace? Well, 30 might be possible, if not quite likely. How do you bake that into his price in drafts? Well, I still think I would keep Naylor outside of the top seven at first base, which pretty much represents the top two tiers at the position. But I do think Naylor's return to Seattle might be enough of a tiebreaker to bump him ahead of the likes of Vinnie Pasquantino and Ben Rice in the third tier, similar hitters who don't have any stolen base upside. A pick around 65th overall feels like the right place to slot Naylor in, and you'll be getting a good batting average (even for a first baseman) and rare steals from the position; he should also be a very good source of RBI in a good lineup, thanks to his contact-heavy approach. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Shedeur Sanders' house was burglarized on Sunday, the same day he received his first regular-season NFL action, multiple sources, including cleveland.com's Mary Kay Cabot, reported Monday.It's unclear if anything was stolen. No suspects have been identified.Sanders, 23, made his official NFL debut during the second half of the Browns' 23-16 loss to the Ravens after Cleveland's starting quarterback, Dillon Gabriel, went into concussion protocol during halftime. Sanders finished 4 for 16 for 47 yards with an interception and two sacks taken.The Browns, who led 16-10 when Sanders entered, managed just four first downs in the second half. It was not only Sanders' first NFL game, but his first time working with the first-team offense, coach Kevin Stefanski said after the game -- a difficult situation but not at all uncommon for a backup quarterback.\n\"I don't think I played good at all,\" Sanders said after his debut. \"I think it's a lot of things we need to look at during the week and go and just get comfortable even throwing routes with Jerry [Jeudy] and throwing routes with all those guys. I think that was my first ball to him all year. But other than that, I just think overall we just gotta go next week and understand so then we have a week to prepare stuff I like to do.\"Sanders is expected to get his first NFL start in Week 12 against the Raiders and will have to prepare while dealing with the break-in as well.Sanders is one of several notable athletes whose house has been broken into while the in the past year-plus. Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce's homes were burglarized during the 2024 season, as was Joe Burrow's. In February 2025, federal prosecutors charged seven men -- alleged members of a South American crime syndicate -- with conspiracy to commit interstate transportation of stolen property. All of those burglaries occurred when those players were out of town for games; Sanders and the Browns were home Sunday.\nThe break-ins have not been limited to the NFL. In late December, 2024, the house of Luka Dončić, then with the Mavericks, was burglarized, with about $30,000 worth of jewelry stolen. Timberwolves guard Mike Conley and Bucks forward Bobby Portis were also victims of similar crimes. The FBI warned sports leagues about crime organizations targeting athletes' homes shortly after the Dončić incident. The NFL and NBA issued memos to its players a month earlier.\n            ",

The total he'll be out: $507,156.Ramsey was ejected from Pittsburgh's 34-12 win over the Bengals after throwing a punch at Chase early in the fourth quarter. He said afterward that his actions were the byproduct of Chase spitting on him, an accusation that Chase denied. Referee Bill Vinovich said afterward that his crew did not see Chase spit on Ramsey. The NFL, however, clearly determined that Chase did in fact spit on the Steelers' free safety. \nChase's suspension is in line with what Eagles defensive tackle Jalen Carter received after he spit on Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott back in Week 1. Carter, who spit on Prescott prior to the game starting, was ejected for the entirety of that game and was also fined $57,222, which for Carter was the equivalent of losing a game check. Chase's absence will be a significant blow for a Bengals team that has won just one game since losing quarterback Joe Burrow to injury back in Week 2. \nA Pro Bowl receiver each of the past four years, Chase led the NFL with 76 receptions through 11 weeks. He wasn't much of a factor in Cincinnati's latest loss, however, as he caught just 3 of 10 targets for 30 yards during the Bengals' loss to the Steelers. \n            \n    ",

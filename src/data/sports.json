The U.S. women's national team player delivered a stunning equalizer against Racing Louisville FC, which snatched a critical point in a 2-2 draw and ensured Gotham's place in the 2025 NWSL postseason. Lavelle scored the goal off a dead-ball situation. Gotham earned a free kick in a dangerous spot in the final third, and the veteran midfielder took her place over the mark. She struck the ball with her left for a clinical finish, showing off equal parts technical brilliance and sheer will. \nShe showed her veteran presence in a big moment and only needed a little step to get behind a sensational effort. The goalkeeper was frozen for just a moment, perhaps wondering if Lavelle would go far post, and that little hesitation gave the American star enough time to curl the ball over the wall and into the goal.\nWith the draw, Gotham are on 36 points and are currently the seven seed ahead of the final day of the regular season on Nov. 2. Thanks to conceding that late goal, the dropped points leave Louisville in the eighth spot, ahead of the last game with the North Carolina Courage two points back.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The month of October is starting to near its end and the days are getting shorter. With fall in full swing, the NFL is starting to figure out which teams are going to be buyers and sellers for the trade deadline in a few weeks -- based on the results on the field. The early Sunday slate didn't have much drama, but the late games saved the day. The Miami Dolphins were blown out by the Cleveland Browns and the New York Jets lost again. The Los Angeles Rams look like Super Bowl contenders while the Philadelphia Eagles went back to their winning ways. The Kansas City Chiefs also look the part of a title team (again). Plenty of storylines mean plenty of overreactions. Which ones have merit and which are truly overreactions? The early games provided the punch. Brian Daboll should lose his job over Giants collapseOverreaction or reality: RealitySomehow, the Giants lost to the Broncos. Somehow it happened. The Broncos were trailing 19-0 entering the fourth quarter, and scored 33 points in the final 15 minutes! The Giants were up 26-8 with six minutes to go, and still allowed 25 points and lost! \nThis is one of the most incredible comebacks in NFL history, as Bo Nix combined for four touchdowns in the fourth quarter. The Broncos had 291 yards of offense in the fourth quarter, making this one of the all-time collapses in NFL history -- and the Giants took the lead in the final minute! Daboll is an offensive coach, but he hired defensive coordinator Shane Bowen. He also employs Jude McAtamney, who missed two extra points in this one. The Giants just have a losing culture under Daboll, and that was on full display in this epic meltdown. Jaxson Dart shouldn't save Daboll because he's a good quarterback. If anything, that's another reason to move on. \nCommanders are the worst team in the NFC EastOverreaction or reality: OverreactionThis is a product of having the oldest roster in the NFL and a defense that's ranked 27th in yards per game in 23rd in points allowed per game. The Commanders defense was horrendous against the cowboys, as CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens dominated an overmatched secondary in a Dallas blowout. The Cowboys may have the most explosive offense in football, but that doesn't take away from the narrative. If Jayden Daniels, who left with an injured hamstring, is out an extended period of time, the Commanders may finish last in this division. They don't have a chance at the playoffs without Daniels, especially since Terry McLaurin and Deebo Samuel just can't stay healthy. This is an old team that won a lot of games at the buzzer last year. That recipe is hard to sustain and the talent level is showing. The Eagles and Cowboys are better than the Commanders, and the Giants may be better, too, with Jaxson Dart as quarterback. \nWashington will probably miss the playoffs and finish with a losing record. 49ers are running Christian McCaffrey into the groundOverreaction or reality: RealityMcCaffrey is the reason why the 49ers are 5-2, having his best performance of the season in Sunday's win over the Falcons. He hd 31 touches for 201 scrimmage (129 rushing, 72 receiving) and two touchdowns -- carrying the 49ers offense against the Falcons. The 49ers offense has been run through McCaffrey, who has an NFL-high 185 touches through seven games (26.4 per game). The 49ers have used McCaffrey to their advantage, but they also have risked injury to an oft-injured running back. McCaffrey is on pace for 449 touches this season -- a career-high by 46 touches! They can't keep up overusing McCaffrey, can they?San Francisco doesn't use the playmakers it has at wide receiver enough, even though Ricky Pearsall, Jauan Jennings, and Kendrick Bourne can play. George Kittle is also back, but the 49ers used him as a blocker for McCaffrey on Sunday instead of in the passing game. \nUsing McCaffrey this much wins games, but how much can San Francisco risk him? If McCaffrey gets injured from overuse, the 49ers' Super Bowl hopes are dashed. This is the injury they can't afford to have, so San Francisco needs to start preserving McCaffrey. Colts are the best team in the AFC Overreaction or reality: RealityRight now, this isn't a debate. The Colts have the best record in the conference at 6-1 and steamrolled the Chargers in a battle of division leaders heading into Week 7. Indianapolis jumped out to a 23-3 lead and never looked back, completely outmatching Los Angeles. Jonathan Taylor rushed for three touchdowns and doesn't even need to carry Daniel Jones, who threw for two scores himself and finished with a 113.4 passer rating. The Colts looked like their season could be heading for disaster going to Jones in August, but instead have emerged as the best team in the conference through seven weeks.\nIndianapolis has the No. 2 offense in yards per game (380.3), No. 1 in yards per play (6.4), and No. 1 in offensive points per game (32.1). This is arguably the best offense in the NFL, as the Colts appear to be cruising to the AFC South title. Are the Colts Super Bowl contenders? That will be determined when the schedule gets tougher, but they are the best team in the AFC through seven weeks. Tua Tagovailoa's time with the Dolphins is over Overreaction or reality: OverreactionThere's little explanation for how poor Tua Tagovailoa was on Sunday against the Browns defense, as the Dolphins QB looked completely overmatched until he was removed from the game for Quinn Ewers. He was 12 of 23 for 100 yards with three interceptions and a 24.1 passer rating, the third Dolphins quarterback since 1970 with three interceptions in back-to-back games -- and the first since Dan Marino in 1986. \nThe Dolphins couldn't get anything going offensively, as Tagovailoa averaged 4.3 yards per attempt. Tagovailoa has 11 touchdowns to 10 interceptions and is averaging 6.4 yards per attempt with an 82.8 rating. He's struggled without Tyreek Hill and a poor offensive line.Without Hill, Tagovailoa has six interceptions and a 69.2 rating in three games. Perhaps the Dolphins are thinking a change is needed, which would mean the end of Tagovailoa in Miami. While that isn't likely the case, the Dolphins moving on may be in the conversation -- but it's too soon to move on (and Tagovailoa has three years left on his $1212.4 million extension).The Dolphins won't bench Tagovailoa and eat that money, giving him an opportunity to rebound with a new coach in place first. \n\n        \n            \n                Cover 32: Jets officially on 0-17 watch after Justin Fields benching, plus games balls and gaffes from Week 7\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nEagles have their offense fixedOverreaction or reality: OverreactionThe Eagles offense took a significant step in the right direction on Sunday, as Jalen Hurts and the passing offense had their best game in years. Hurts finished 19 of 23 for 326 yards with three touchdowns and no interceptions, posting a 158.3 passer rating against the NFL's No. 1 pass defense. Hurts went 4 of 4 for 189 yards on throws of 25-plus air yards, as the Eagles finally got the deep ball going. A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith each had two catches on those throws and combined for 54 yards after the catch. Hurts was 9 of 12 for 284 yards and three touchdowns on passes of 10-plus air yards -- good for a 156.3 rating and 23.7 yards per attempt. On third and fourth down, Hurts went 7 of 8 for 145 yards and a touchdown (158.3 rating). In the second half, he was 10 of 12 for 240 yards and two touchdowns.The offense is back right? The run game still struggled, having just 23 carries for 45 yards (2.0 yards per carry) as Saquon Barkley finished with only 44 yards and 2.4 yards per carry. Barkley has 369 yards rushing through seven games and is averaging 3.3 yards per carry. The communication isn't there up front and Barkley has struggled to have big gains. \nIf the pass offense can get the running game going, the Eagles will be dangerous. The unit wasn't perfect on Sunday, but this was a step in the right direction. Trevor Lawrence is a bust Overreaction or reality: OverreactionThere's a lot to criticize about Trevor Lawrence's performance on Sunday, as he finished just 23 of 48 for 296 yards with a touchdown and zero interceptions (74.7 rating) in Jacksonville's blowout loss. Lawrence's numbers should have been worse, as he was 7 of 12 for 111 yards and a touchdown in the fourth quarter -- when the Jaguars were down four scores. Lawrence struggles to get the ball to his receivers, as Travis Hunter and Brian Thomas Jr. were open multiple times throughout the afternoon. When he forces the ball to Thomas, Hunter is open -- and vice versa. Hunter should be significantly better on offense, but Lawrence's inconsistent play at quarterback holds him back.\nWhile Lawrence hasn't played like a No. 1 pick in his five years, does that mean he's a bust? Not necessarily, as Lawrence has already been through three play callers, three head coaches, and an unstable organization in his five seasons. He's still learning Grant Udinski's offense, but the early returns haven't been promising. Lawrence is a starting quarterback in the league and he'll have a long career, but he's not elite. Calling Lawrence good is a reach too, but that doesn't mean he's a bust. Rashee Rice is going to get Patrick Mahomes his third MVPOverreaction or reality: RealityPatrick Mahomes has been on fire in recent weeks, and only got his best wideout back in Rashee Rice after the wide receiver finished serving his six-game suspension. All Rice did in his first game back was have two touchdowns, as Mahomes finished 26 of 35 for 266 yards with three touchdowns and zero interceptions (126.6 rating) in a shutout of the Raiders. Rice was targeted 10 times by Mahomes in his debut, as Mahomes had a 117.5 passer rating when throwing to him. Mahomes has been hot of late, completing 71.3% of his passes for 1,131 yards with 11 touchdowns to one interception and a 117.2 passer rating over his last four games -- MVP-type numbers.The Chiefs are 4-3 and making their run at the AFC West after an 0-2 start, and Mahomes has been the driving force. If Mahomes keep playing like this, he'll win the MVP as the Chiefs make a run at the Super Bowl again. With Rice back, Mahomes' play will only improve.Drake Maye is having best season for QB in Patriots historyOverreaction or reality: OverreactionDrake Maye had another incredible performance in Sunday's win over the Titans, finishing 21 of 23 for 222 yards with two touchdowns and zero interceptions for a 135.9 passer rating -- setting a Patriots single-game record by completing 91.3% of his passes. This season, Maye has made his own MVP case as the Patriots lead the AFC East at 5-2. He's completed 75.2% of his passes for 1,744 yards with 12 touchdowns and two interceptions for a 116.4 passer rating. He has the third-highest completion percentage through seven games in NFL history (75.2%) and his 116.4 rating is the highest for any Patriots player since Tom Brady in 2007.Is this the best season ever by a Patriots quarterback? No, but it's in the conversation. Brady threw 50 touchdowns and had a 117.2 passer rating in 2007, as the Patriots went 16-0 in the regular season. He led the NFL in completion percentage (68.6%), passing yards (4,806), passing touchdowns (50), and passer rating (117.2) -- one of the greatest seasons by a quarterback ever. For Maye to even be in the conversation is impressive. If the Patriots didn't have Brady for 20 years, this would be the best year for any quarterback in franchise history. Remember, Maye is just in his second year.Matthew Stafford is a first-ballot Hall of Fame quarterbackOverreaction or reality: RealityAnother game for Matthew Stafford, another standout performance. Stafford was dominant against the Jaguars defense in London, setting an international-game record with five touchdown passes in the convincing Rams victory. He finished 21 of 33 for 182 yards and five touchdown passes with zero interceptions -- a 117.7 passer rating.Stafford is having one of his best seasons at age 37, having 17 touchdown passes to just two interceptions through seven games. He was leading the NFL in passing yards entering Week 7 and his touchdown-to-interception ratio is 32 touchdown passes to just three interceptions over his last 16 games started (including playoffs).Already with a Super Bowl championship (and the most touchdown passes in a season with 60, including postseason), Stafford is ninth all time in passing yards (61,675) and ninth in passing touchdowns (394). As the numbers keep going up and the wins keep coming with Los Angeles, Stafford has solidified his Hall of Fame case. He may be a first-ballot Hall of Famer as well.\n            ",

    "description": "\n        ARLINGTON, Texas -- The 2025 Dallas Cowboys offense in Week 7 featured its complete cast of playmakers with All-Pro wide receiver CeeDee Lamb",
    "body": "\n        ARLINGTON, Texas -- The 2025 Dallas Cowboys offense in Week 7 featured its complete cast of playmakers with All-Pro wide receiver CeeDee Lamb back after three-game absence while dealing with a sprained ankle, and All-Pro return man/wide receiver KaVontae Turpin back in the fold. As a result, Dallas turned Sunday afternoon at AT&T Stadium into an offensive fireworks show in a dominant 44-22 victory over the NFC East rival Washington Commanders. How good is Dallas' 2025 offensive attack that is averaging 31.7 points per game (third-best in the NFL entering \"Sunday Night Football and \"Monday Night Football\") and 390.6 total yards per game (the best in the NFL entering \"Sunday Night Football and \"Monday Night Football\")? Lamb, who exploded for 110 yards and a touchdown (a 74-yarder) on five catches, believes this year's Cowboys attack that features himself and wide receiver 1B George Pickens (four catches for 82 yards on Sunday) is the best of his Dallas career, which began back in 2020.\"This one is the best one I've been on, and I've been on some great ones. It's just the way we can move around these pieces and these players,\" Lamb said postgame on Sunday. \"Everybody knows where to go. Everybody lines up faster than any [I've been on]. It's tough.\"Lamb's sentiment can certainly be backed up by his and his teammates' production, both individually and collectively. The 31.7 points per game Dallas is averaging right now is the most of any team quarterbacked by Dak Prescott, since 2016, just ahead of the 31.2 points per game the Cowboys' 2021 offense averaged. The 2025 Cowboys are also the third team in NFL history to score at least 40 points in each of their first three home games of a season, joining the Roger Staubach and Tom Landry 1973 Cowboys and the \"Greatest Show on Turf\" 2000 St. Louis Rams, per CBS Sports Research. \n\"I don't want to take anything away from those guys … but I will tell you Lamb's ability to really make the difference on an offense. Now Pickens has that ability as well along with our running game,\" Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones said postgame. \"Really, I feel as good about that offense as I have in a long time around here.\"Pickens and tight end Jake Ferguson each have six receiving touchdowns this year, career-highs for both that are tied for the most in the entire NFL entering \"Sunday Night Football\" and \"Monday Night Football\" in Week 7. Pickens' 607 yards receiving are the fourth-most in the NFL. Ferguson's 51 catches are the third-most in the NFL. Ferguson is the first tight end in NFL history with at least 50 catches (51) and six receiving touchdowns (6) in the first seven games of a season. Running back Javonte Williams' 592 yards rushing are the second-most in football while his six rushing touchdowns are the third-most in the league. Prescott's 16 passing touchdowns are the second-most in the NFL, just one behind Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford's 17. \"Not a knock to any other group that I've been a part of, but the chemistry, the camaraderie, the trash talking, the emotions and passion of this unit -- it's there as much as I've ever seen it,\" Prescott said postgame. \"Sure, we've got some youth that's probably a big part of it, but we've got guys who just work their tails off every day, and I say it all the time, confidence is earned. ...This group practices the right way, and they've earned the confidence. They go out there, and we play with it and it's fun. It really is fun. It's in a collaborative effort, and it's not about me. It's not about any one person in that group. It's about the way that we all play for one another, doing our 1/11 each play and seeing what the result is afterwards.\"\nMuch of that production has come in the last four games, and the result is the 2025 Cowboys offense is now just the fifth since the 1970 AFL/NFL merger to average at least 35 points per game without a turnover in a four-game span within a single season, per CBS Sports Research. The other such occurrences were 2010's New England Patriots offenses piloted by Tom Brady (2010 and 2014 -- Brady was the 2010 NFL MVP) and 2010's Green Bay Packers offenses led by Aaron Rodgers (2014 and 2020-- Rodgers won NFL MVP in both such seasons).\"I think we've got an outstanding leader in our quarterback, and we got an outstanding player in the quarterback,\" Jones said. 35+ PPG & 0 turnovers in four-game span, unique spans in single season since 1970SeasonRecord In SpanDallas Cowboys20252-1-1Green Bay Packers20204-0Green Bay Packers20144-0New England Patriots20144-0New England Patriots20104-0Speaking of Prescott, his 13 passing touchdowns since Week 4 in this historic four-game stretch lead the NFL in this span, and he's thrown at least three scoring strikes without an interception in all four games of this magical run. That's now tied for the second-most consecutive games with at least three passing touchdowns and no interceptions in NFL history. Prescott is in a club with quarterbacks like Drew Brees (2019), Rodgers (2014), Peyton Manning (2013-2014) and Brady (2007) in this regard. \"A lot of things coming together. It's all the work that I've put into this. Personally, a lot of offseason work to the team  getting together in the spring, to training camp. Success through these last few games is just only growing the confidence.\" Prescott said of this four-game stretch when asked by CBS Sports. \"I know who I am. I feel great throwing the ball. When you got pass catchers like those two guys [Pickens and Lamb], .... Turp [KaVontae  Turpin], [Jalen] Tolbert, Flo [Ryan Flournoy] that are making plays and taking advantage of their opportunities whenever  they come. I'm just gonna keep pushing myself to get better. You've been around, you understand that, that's all I want to do.\"\"Dak's playing really well. You know, I'm not trying to not make a big deal about him playing great, but that's what we  expect from Dak, and he's got incredible weapons,\" head coach Brian Schottenheimer said postgame. ...\"But you see the trust that he has in these guys.\" Is Prescott more proud of his 13 touchdowns or no interceptions in this historic stretch? His answer: a little bit of both. \"I'm not sure. \"I think they go hand-in-hand to be honest. When you take care of the ball, you have more opportunities to  score touchdowns, and that's leading to that,\" Prescott said. \"Not counting the touchdowns, probably the interceptions being true. I couldn't tell you how many touchdowns it was, but I can tell you that I hadn't thrown an interception. I'm trying to be smart with it, but not hesitant, scared or cautious at the same time. I have tons of confidence in what I can do, where I can put it, and the guys that I'm throwing it to, so that's just a result of that.\"Most consecutive games with 3-plus pass TD and 0 INT, NFL historyConsecutive gamesSEA Russell Wilson (2015)5DAL Dak Prescott (2025)4NO Drew Brees (2019)4GB Aaron Rodgers (2014)4DEN Peyton Manning (2013-2014)4NE Tom Brady (2007)4No play further exemplified the trust Prescott has in his weapons than his 74-yard deep ball touchdown pass to Lamb. Pickens was actually the No. 1 read on that play, and the way he was designed to run his route was for him to get a deep ball to go to the house. Prescott was ready to make that throw, but then he saw Lamb's hand go up, and he made the heave to ol' reliable, No. 88. That led to Lamb and Pickens dancing their way together into the end zone for an early 17-8 lead at the tail end of the first quarter. \"It wasn't the route we were expecting. It was built for him [Lamb] to run a deep cross right there. I go through read one, which was George [Pickens], then I see the big window where if he would've ran that route, he would've had a great play, not a touchdown,\" Prescott said. \"I looked to find CeeDee, and he's got his hands up saying 'I'm here.' At that point, I saw the safety or the corner to the right. I just put about everything I had on the line, understanding that I could just lob it up and both guys would be able to make a play and try to give them a chance. He [Lamb] took a good job taking two steps back and catching the  ball and walked into the end zone. Once again, it was a play that's not made unless you have confidence in the guy you're throwing to and that guy is smart and understands the defense, understands the look, and understands he can take the  opportunity. We were able to capitalize on that.\"That's why Schottenheimer called the play a \"mailbox\" play: Lamb stuck his hand up, and Prescott found him. Pickens running his route in front of Lamb created confusion in the secondary as two Commanders defenders bumped into each other on the play. \"That's not a surprise to me. He always helps me, you know what I'm saying?\" Lamb said when asked about Pickens clearing the way for him on the play. \"That's why we brought him here. It's exciting, and he was the first person I saw after I caught it. There was nobody there, so I already knew what it was.\"Lamb called it \"our touchdown\" as the two pranced down the sideline and into the end zone together. \"At that point, it turns into our touchdown. It's just whoever brings the ball in,\" Lamb said. \"I feel like 'let's continue to do that and many more in the future.\"\nIn the lead up to this game, Prescott felt comfortable indicating Lamb and Pickens were his top wide receiver duo ever, even better than the tandem of Pro Bowler Amari Cooper and a younger version of Lamb in 2021. With his former No. 88 Dez Bryant in the building for Dallas' 2025 homecoming game on Sunday, he joked he was going to say that a little more quietly, but he affirmed the sentiment once more. \"It's up to y'all to decide. Dez [Bryant] was just in there too so don't say that too loud,\" Prescott said laughing. \"Those dudes are unbelievable. They are, and that's credit to them. That's credit to the way they show up and work each and every day. That's credit to the standard that they have for themselves. That's credit to the love they have for one another, the way that they push one  another. They definitely are.\"Lamb and Pickens are \"definitely\" Prescott's top wide receiver duo of his 10-year career, and the longer he continues to produce like this, the 2025 Cowboys offense will begin to separate itself as well as the best of the Prescott era (2016-present) in Dallas.\"The sky is the limit,\" Prescott said.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Denver Broncos pulled off one of the most unlikely comebacks in NFL history on Sunday. The Broncos were able to beat the New York Giants 33-32 despite the fact that they were trailing 19-0 going into the fourth quarter. Here are five wild stats to know from Denver's win, including two NFL records that the Broncos set. NFL record: Broncos' fourth-quarter explosionGoing into the fourth quarter, the Broncos were trailing 19-0 and it didn't look like they had a chance to win the game, but then they exploded for 33 points during the final quarter to win. It was the most points ever scored by a team that had been shut out through the first three quarters. The Broncos broke a record that had been held by the 1981 Atlanta Falcons, who got shut out for three quarters by the Green Bay Packers before scoring 31 in the final quarter. The Broncos and Falcons are the only two teams in NFL history to score at least 30 points after scoring zero in the first three quarters. \nNFL record, Part II: Bo Nix goes offThe Broncos were able to score 33 points thanks in large part to Bo Nix, who had one of the best fourth-quarter performances in NFL history. Not only did Nix throw for 174 yards and two touchdowns in the final quarter, but he also rushed for 46 yards and two MORE touchdowns. \nWith those four scores, Nix became the first player in NFL history with two passing touchdowns AND two rushing touchdowns in any quarter ever. Broncos' fourth-quarter point total almost broke recordAs we've already mentioned multiple times, the Broncos scored 33 points during the fourth quarter, which isn't a record, but it was the second most points that any team has ever scored during the fourth quarter of a game in NFL history. The only team to score more came in 2007 when the Detroit Lions scored 34 points in the fourth quarter during a 34-14 win over the Chicago Bears. \nComeback kidsThe Broncos were trailing 26-8 with just six minutes left to play and still managed to win, making them just the second team since 2000 to win a game after trailing 18 points or more in the final six minutes. The only other time that's happened over the past 25 years came in 2003 when Peyton Manning led the Colts back from a 21-point deficit in the final six minutes during a 38-35 win over the Buccaneers. NFL teams had lost 1,602 consecutive games when trailing by 18 points or more in the final six minutes, but that streak ended on Sunday. Comeback kids, Part IIThe win over the Giants marked the second time this month that the Broncos have won a game despite trailing by at least 14 points heading into the fourth quarter (The Broncos trailed the Eagles 17-3 going into the fourth quarter back in Week 5 before winning the game, 21-17). The Broncos are just the third team since the AFL-NFL merger to overcome a deficit of 14 points or more in the fourth quarter of two different games in the same month. \nThe only other teams to pull that off are the Bears (September 2020) and the Dolphins (September 1980). The win over the Giants marked the first time since 1983 that the Broncos won a game despite trailing by at least 19 points heading into the fourth quarter. It was a huge win for the Broncos, who are now sitting atop the AFC West with a one-game lead over both the Chargers and the Chiefs. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Sunday delivered a few close games involving teams toward the top of the 2026 NFL Draft order, but only one team with one win or fewer emerged victorious. In a battle between one-win teams Cleveland and Miami, the Browns emerged victorious. The vibes around the latter are sour right now and it feels as though there is a clear tier gap between the two worst teams and the rest of the league right now. As a reminder, there are three teams without a first-round pick in 2026 as a result of draft day trades, plus the Micah Parsons deal: Atlanta, Green Bay and Jacksonville. Here is the current 2026 NFL Draft order, per Tankathon, as well as potential team needs:1. New York Jets (0-7)Projected needs: QB, WR, DL, CB, TENew York benched Justin Fields, but the team's fate remained the same. Tyrod Taylor was unable to lead the Jets to a touchdown in a close scoring contest. One would assume a quarterback could be targeted in the first round. \n2. Miami Dolphins (1-6)Projected needs: CB, WR, TE, IOL, SIt looks as though Miami is hurtling towards wholesale changes after failing to score a touchdown against the Browns. Tua Tagovailoa may leave the franchise little reason not to take a quarterback with what looks to be an early draft pick. 3. New Orleans Saints (1-6)Projected needs: CB, S, DL, RB, WRSpencer Rattler had given New Orleans quality quarterback play this season, but Sunday was a setback. Rattler took four sacks and threw three interceptions in the decision. 4. Tennessee Titans (1-6)Projected needs: OT, IOL, WR, DL, EDGETennessee put up little fight as Mike Vrabel enacted revenge against his former employer. It was the first game without head coach Brian Callahan. \n5. Baltimore Ravens (1-5)Projected needs: EDGE, DL, IOL, TE, CBBaltimore is on a Bye this week as Lamar Jackson and others get valuable rest. 6. Cleveland Browns (2-5)Projected needs: OT, WR, QB, CB, IOLThe Browns were able to bring an end to multiple droughts, including scoring more than 17 points, in Sunday's lopsided win over Miami. Cleveland has a winnable stretch of games ahead, so it will be interesting to see where the team's place in the pecking order is a month from now.7. Las Vegas Raiders (2-5)Projected needs: CB, LB, S, DL, OTGeno Smith continued to struggle, throwing for just 67 yards in a landslide loss. Las Vegas turned to Kenny Pickett in an effort to answer offensive woes, but found no solution. 8. New York Giants (2-5)Projected needs: IOL, OT, DL, CB, LBThe Giants stormed out to a sizable lead on the road against Denver, then surrendered the lead in the fourth quarter. Rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart led the team back down the lead for a go-ahead touchdown, but Bo Nix countered with a go-ahead drive of his own to set up a game-winning field goal. \n9. Arizona Cardinals (2-5)Projected needs: OT, IOL, LB, DL, RBJacoby Brissett played an efficient brand of football in Kyler Murray's absence, but it was not enough to overcome the Packers. Tight end Trey McBride found the end zone twice. 10. Houston Texans (2-3)Projected needs: IOL, OT, TE, DL, SHouston meets Seattle on Monday Night Football. 11. Cincinnati Bengals (3-4)Projected needs: IOL, CB, S, TE, EDGEJoe Flacco trusted that Ja'Marr Chase was down the field somewhere as the Bengals' high-powered air attack was able to keep pace with Pittsburgh. Cincinnati's postseason dreams remain alive. 12. Washington Commanders (3-4)Projected needs: EDGE, LB, CB, TE, WRJayden Daniels struggled as the Commanders dropped below .500 on the season. They have lost three of their last four games. \n13. Dallas Cowboys (3-3-1)Projected needs: S, LB, EDGE, RB, CBOffense and defense got involved in the scoring as the Cowboys doubled up the Commanders. CeeDee Lamb ruined to the starting lineup as George Pickens continued making a positive impression.14. Los Angeles Rams via Atlanta Falcons (3-3)Projected needs: CB, OT, LB, S, IOLLos Ángeles owns the rights to Atlanta's first round pick after the latter traded back into the first round for James Pearce Jr.  15. Minnesota Vikings (3-3)Projected needs: LB, CB, S, DL, RBIt was another week with Carson Wentz installed as the starting quarterback. Minnesota continues its streak of having no streaks this season. The Vikings have alternated wins and losses each week with a primetime showdown against the Chargers setting up to be a victory. \n16. Carolina Panthers (4-3)Projected needs: CB, S, IOL, WR, DLWinners of three in a row, Carolina has begun to distance themselves in the draft conversations. Five games against NFC South foes lie ahead.17. Kansas City Chiefs (4-3)Projected needs: DL, RB, CB, LB, TEWritten meme: Undertaker rising from the coffin as Kansas City gains momentum. Rashee Rice scored twice in his 2025 debut and the Chiefs are winners in four of the last five games.  18. Chicago Bears (4-2)Projected needs: DL, S, IOL, RB, OTChicago continues on its upward trajectory with its fourth consecutive victory. The team has scored at least 21 in every game this season. \n19. Cleveland Browns via Jacksonville Jaguars (4-3)Projected needs: OT, WR, QB, CB, IOLCleveland holds the rights to Jacksonville's pick in the first round. The Jaguars fell behind to the Rams quickly in London and were never able to regain footing on foreign soil. Travis Hunter Jr. did score the first touchdown of his career. 20. Los Angeles Chargers (4-3)Projected needs: IOL, EDGE, CB, TE, DLLos Angeles was the latest to succumb to Daniel Jones and the Colts. The AFC West race has tightened in a hurry with Kansas City surging back and Denver winning its share of one-score games.21. Buffalo Bills (4-2)Projected needs: S, LB, EDGE, CB, WRBuffalo is amidst its one and only Bye of the season. The Bills have some wounds of their own to lick as they work to fix early season problems. \n22. Seattle Seahawks (4-2)Projected needs: CB, DL, IOL, S, WRSeattle hosts the late game against Houston Monday night. 23. Detroit Lions (4-2)Projected needs: EDGE, DL, LB, CB, OTIn the first game of a Monday night double-header, Detroit hosts Tampa Bay.24. Los Angeles Rams (5-2)Projected needs: CB, OT, LB, S, IOLMatthew Stafford and the Rams pounced on the Jaguars early in the absence of star wide receiver Puka Nacua. Stafford leaned on Davante Adams to matriculate down the field.25. Pittsburgh Steelers (4-2)Projected needs: QB, DL, WR, CB, IOLMike Tomlin publicly voiced his frustrations that Cleveland traded a quality quarterback, Joe Flacco, to a division rival.

    "body": "\n        In the first of two \"Monday Night Football\" games, the Detroit Lions play host to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.Detroit is coming off a loss to the Kansas City Chiefs last Sunday night that snapped a four-game winning streak. The Lions enter this game at 4-2 now, and need to get back in the win column to compete in the races for the NFC North and seeding in the NFC playoffs in general.Tampa won by a somewhat comfortable margin for the first time all year last week, defeating the 49ers by multiple scores. The Buccaneers are 5-1 and looking like one of the best teams in the NFC, but they've had to pull off a high-wire act to get to where they are. They've got a lead in the NFC South, but could drop back to the pack if they don't pick up a victory here.Will the Buccaneers continue to roll, or will the Lions get back in the win column? We'll find out soon enough. Before we break down the matchup, here's a look at how you can watch the game.\nWhere to watch Lions vs. Buccaneers liveDate: Monday, Oct. 20 | Time: 7:00 p.m. ETLocation: Ford Field (Detroit)TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (try for free) Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Lions -6, O/U 53.5 (via DraftKings Sportsbook)Bet Lions vs. Buccaneers and other NFL games at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and three free months of NBA League Pass.When the Buccaneers have the ball\nBaker Mayfield is playing at an extraordinarily high level this season. He's completed 66.2% of his passes at an average of 7.9 yards per attempt, with 12 touchdowns and just one interception. He's done this despite playing without Chris Godwin for all but two games, without Mike Evans for three and without Emeka Egbuka for much of last week's win over the 49ers. He's also done it despite the Bucs shuffling their offensive line all year long. Evans is expected to return for this game, while Egbuka is considered a game-time decision despite suffering a hamstring strain last week. Evans' return is an especially welcome one for a game where the Lions will be without multiple defensive backs. Brian Branch was suspended for smacking JuJu Smith-Schuster last week, while Terrion Arnold, Avonte Maddox and Kerby Joseph are all out with injuries. \nThe only starting Lions defensive back who will be active for this game is Amik Robertson, and he'll likely be playing out of position on the perimeter due to the other injuries. There should be chances for Evans to get open against the backup DBs, and for Egbuka to get going as well, if he plays. Detroit is 14th in EPA per dropback allowed to opponents, via Tru Media, but will be without 80% of the starting defensive backfield.The best way to make up for the injuries on the back end is obviously to generate consistent pressure. The Lions have gotten to quarterbacks at just about an exactly league-average rate so far this season, while the Bucs have also allowed pressure at an average rate. The Lions have to be very careful about their rush lane integrity in this one, as Mayfield has been fantastic at escaping the rush and scrambling for first downs. Mayfield has 17 scrambles so far this year and is averaging 9.5 yards a pop, per Tru Media.\nIn the run game, it will again be Rachaad White filling in for Bucky Irving, who remains out with multiple injuries. White hasn't been particularly efficient running the ball this year, averaging 4.0 yards per carry and just 3.4 per carry in his two starts. Detroit is 10th in yards allowed per carry this season, and has done an excellent job at limiting yards after contact (2.29 per rush compared with a league average of 3.00). White could find tough sledding here, putting some pressure on Mayfield and the passing game to carry the offense. That's how the Bucs operate anyway, though, so they'll likely be comfortable in a situation such as that.\nWhen the Lions have the ballDetroit's offense has looked world-beating in four of its six games and rather ordinary in the other two. In Weeks 2 through 5, the Lions averaged 394.8 yards and 40.3 points per game, scoring 34 or more in each contest. In Weeks 1 and 6, though, they averaged 271.5 yards per game and scored just 30 points total. The difference in the two poor games, perhaps unsurprisingly, is that they went down by multiple scores and had to rely on the straight dropback passing game rather than being able to mix run, pass and play action. \nIn Weeks 2 through 5, Jared Goff's \"true\" dropback rate, according to Tru Media, was just 53.6%, which means that the Lions were running screens, play action or RPOs on more than 46% of their dropbacks. In Weeks 1 and 6, though, the true dropback rate spiked to 64.9%, indicating that they were only able to get to screens, play action or RPOs around 35% of the time. That's equivalent to the difference between being exactly league average in true dropback rate and ranking second-to-last. The Lions want to live toward the lower end of the spectrum in that stat so that they can access the full breadth of their offense.\nHow they choose to attack this Tampa Bay defense will be interesting to watch. The Lions are typically an Establish the Run type of team, but Tampa ranks fifth-best in opponents' rushing success rate allowed, via Tru Media, and just 25th in passing success rate. Opponents have completed 68.3% of their passes at an average of 7.6 yards per attempt, with 10 touchdowns against four interceptions against Tampa so far this year. The Buccaneers have once again blitzed at one of the highest rates in the NFL, sending extra rushers on 35.3% of opponent dropbacks. Goff has torn apart blitzes this season, ranking first in the NFL in EPA per dropback while completing 37 of 48 passes for 495 yards, four touchdowns and no interceptions. It's notable that last year, the Bucs dialed back their blitz rate considerably in their game against the Lions, sending pressure on just 26.8% of dropbacks. Goff threw for 307 yards in the game, but it took him 55 pass attempts to do so and he threw two interceptions.\nStill, there should be opportunities in the underneath areas of the field for Amon-Ra St. Brown, given that we should expect Tampa to play a heavy dosage of zone defense against a team that tears apart man coverage. The Bucs have also given up an above-average rate of explosive passing plays, per Tru Media, so they'll have to protect against the possibility of a deep ball to Jameson Williams over the top of the coverage.\nPrediction\nTampa is 5-1 so far this season but has been walking a very tight rope. The Bucs' five victories have come by a total of just 20 points, with four of those wins coming by a single score. If the Lions can keep Goff well protected, they should be able to move the ball here. And when they move the ball and therefore don't have to play from multiple scores down, they come away with wins. Pick: Lions 31, Buccaneers 23\n            ",

But on the final lap, things went awry for both when Larson ran out of fuel while leading the inside line on the backstretch, opening the door for Briscoe to make his move.\n        \n            \n                NASCAR playoffs 2025 race schedule, results: Complete list of Cup Series race dates, winners, tracks\n                \n                    Steven Taranto                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWith Larson dropping back clearing the inside line, Briscoe ducked to the inside of Bubba Wallace entering turn 3 for the final time, picking up enough drafting help from teammate Ty Gibbs to clear Wallace in the trioval. As Wallace got split three wide, and Byron was spun out coming to the finish line, Briscoe was able to make it to the checkered flag at the front, earning the fifth win of his career and by far the most important to date.\"I can't believe I won a superspeedway race. I haven't done it at any level,\" Briscoe told NBC Sports. \"... It's not hit me. We're going to Phoenix.\"So thankful  that the Lord has blessed me opening doors, even closing doors at times, but certainly opening an incredible door here with Joe Gibbs Racing. God is so good, I say it all the  time. Even today, I just had such a peace. Normally I'm scared to death, a nervous wreck around this place. And I had such a peace that regardless of  the finish, He was going to use it somehow for His glory. And pretty cool that it ends up in  Victory Lane.\"\nTodd Gilliland earned his best career Cup finish in second, followed by Ty Gibbs, Wallace, and Cole Custer. The rest of the top 10 was comprised of Carson Hocevar, Tyler Reddick, Christopher Bell, Zane Smith and Brad Keselowski.With Sunday's win -- his third victory of 2025 -- Briscoe joins Joe Gibbs Racing teammate Denny Hamlin in the Championship 4, giving the company at least a 50 percent chance of winning the Cup championship at the end of a day that ended up being rough for rival companies Hendrick Motorsports and Team Penske. Larson and Byron's last lap issues -- they finished 25th and 26th -- paled in comparison to Chase Elliott, who was taken out in a grinding multi-car crash near the end of stage 1. Elliott finished 40th, leaving him with a single point and putting him 62 points back of the cut line entering the Round of 8 finale at Martinsville.\nAs for Team Penske, Ryan Blaney and Joey Logano went from controlling the race at the front of the field -- Logano led the most laps with 35 -- to getting shuffled back in the lead pack, rendering them unable to make it back to the front when the field formed up three-wide and left them little opportunity to make it back to the front. Logano finished 16th and Blaney 23rd, leaving both in likely Must Win scenarios at Martinsville along with Byron.\nWith one race to go to settle the final two spots in the Championship 4, Christopher Bell (+37) and Kyle Larson (+36) hold a sizeable but delicate lead over the cut line. For William Byron (-36), Logano (-38), Blaney (-47), and Elliott (-62), their likeliest path to racing for a championship in Phoenix now comes down to next week's Round of 8 finale and the penultimate race of the season at Martinsville Speedway.\nYellaWood 500 results#19 - Chase Briscoe#34 - Todd Gilliland#54 - Ty Gibbs#23 - Bubba Wallace#41 - Cole Custer#77 - Carson Hocevar#45 - Tyler Reddick#20 - Christopher Bell#38 - Zane Smith#6 - Brad Keselowski#88 - Shane van Gisbergen (R)#99 - Daniel Suarez#1 - Ross Chastain#42 - John Hunter Nemechek#60 - Ryan Preece#22 - Joey Logano#71 - Michael McDowell#66 - Casey Mears#8 - Kyle Busch#10 - Ty Dillon#62 - Anthony Alfredo#33 - Austin Hill#12 - Ryan Blaney#11 - Denny Hamlin#24 - William Byron#5 - Kyle Larson#3 - Austin Dillon#78 - B.J.

    "body": "\n        The Portland Trail Blazers have agreed to contract extensions for two of their rising young stars. Portland has locked up fourth-year guard Shaedon Sharpe on a four-year, $90 million extension and agreed to a four-year, $82 million deal for third-year forward Toumani Camara, per ESPN. Without reaching a deal by the Oct. 20 deadline, Sharpe would have been slated to enter restricted free agency next summer. Now he's under contract with Portland through the 2029-30 season. Camara, meanwhile, had a team option for the 2026-27 season, but is also now on a deal with the Blazers that will take him through 2029-30.Both Sharpe and Camara are vital pieces of Portland's rebuild. Sharpe, 22, was the seventh pick in the 2022 draft by the Blazers despite not playing a game at Kentucky. He quickly showed his potential by averaging 9.9 points on 47.2% shooting as a rookie. By his third season, he emerged as a starter and averaged 18.5 points as part of Portland's young, developing core. Sharpe's a hyper athletic guard who is dangerous when he gets downhill, and is improving as a facilitator, though there's still plenty of room to grow in that regard. If Sharpe improves his 3-point efficiency (33% shooter in three seasons), then he'll open up even more aspects of his offensive skillet as someone who can be a threat at all three levels. And being able to learn from guards like Jrue Holiday and Damian Lillard will only help Sharpe improve as a scorer and defender.\n\n        \n            \n                The Conversation: Are the Blazers ready to level up after interesting offseason?\n                \n                    James Herbert                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBy reaching a deal, Sharpe avoided a restricted free agency situation next summer, something that went poorly for a number of players this offseason -- primarily Jonathan Kuminga, who played a long game of chicken with the Golden State Warriors before eventually ending his standoff by signing a two-year $45 million deal.Sharpe's new contract with Portland comes on the heels of the Sacramento Kings giving Keegan Murray -- the No. 4 pick in the same draft -- $140 million over five years. Sharpe's been the more productive player in terms of counting stats, but Murray's been an integral piece on a playoff team already, something Sharpe has yet to prove. While Sharpe's deal is not as lucrative as Murray's, it's a solid middle ground for a player who has the potential to outplay his contract in the near future.Camara, 25, is the perfect example of a diamond in the rough, as he was taken with the 52nd pick in the 2023 draft by the Phoenix Suns and then traded to Portland before his rookie season started. In just two seasons, he's developed into an everyday starter and last season earned All-Defensive Second Team honors. He's the ideal 3-and-D piece capable of defending both forward positions, and is a reliable 3-point threat, making 37.5% of his shots from beyond the arc last season. He also ranked ninth in total steals.\nBoth extensions could be steals for Portland as Sharpe and Camara will likely outplay their contracts if they continue to ascend. Sharpe specifically could turn into an All-Star if he continues to develop. And if players like Camara and Deni Avdija stay on an upward trajectory, the Blazers could be a sneaky play-in squad this season. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Week 7 of the Fantasy Football season brought some new players to the forefont with breakout performances that belong on your Fantasy Football radar now. On the Fantasy side, we received more data on how each offense plans to utilize its personnel. Our expectations for backfield touches, targets in the pass game, snap shares, and overall usage are often not met, and that's when we have to pivot.In Week 7, several players jumped on the Fantasy Football radar. This could be the start of something special for some of these players, and you'll want to get well ahead of your Week 8 Fantasy Football waiver wire by putting these players on your radar. For more on every player we discuss below, you'll want to make sure to check out Jamey Eisenberg's in-depth waiver wire column on Monday afternoon.Oronde Gadsden II, TE, ChargersAfter breaking out in Week 6, I was surprised to see Gadsden still available in so many leagues even leading up to Week 7 Sunday kickoffs. I can understand the hesitation considering how many options are available to Justin Herbert in the pass game, but Gadsden is quickly proving to be one of their best. Gadsden provides Herbert a mismatch as he can be matched up against linebackers in man coverage. With defenses focused on stopping the top-three trio of Chargers receivers, Gadsden has found a way to shine with a quarterback who is willing to go through his full progression and get past his first and second reads. Gadsden turned his Week 6 breakout into an even bigger one in Week 7 when he went off for six receptions, 156 receiving yards and a touchdown on eight targets. He will be the top priority waiver addition at any position this week.Xavier Legette, WR, PanthersLegette showed signs of developing as Bryce Young's No. 2 target in Carolina's Week 7 win. He turned 11 targets into nine receptions for 92 yards and a touchdown. He is starting to develop as a strong option for Young in the red zone but in Week 7 he showed he can be more than that. Legette played a key role as a chain mover and turned double-digit targets into nine receptions and nearly 100 yards. That's someone worth rostering as attrition continues and bye weeks make those FLEX decisions much harder. Kyle Monangai, RB, BearsThe Bears came out of the bye last week and showed some signs of getting their rookie back more involved. That continued in Week 7. Monangai saw 13 rushing attempts and turned them into 81 yards and a touchdown. He also saw three targets in the pass game, catching two of them for 13 yards. Monangai is worth rostering as a handcuff but is quickly proving to be a capable back-end FLEX option when the Bears have a positive gamescript in the matchup ahead and 2. \nBrashard Smith, RB, ChiefsWhen the Chiefs drafted Smith -- the former collegiate wide out turned running back -- their director of player personnel made it clear that Andy Reid envisioned a role for him early on. The Chiefs are paying up on that promise already not even halfway through the season. Smith's role has grown in each passing week and in Week 7 he saw a career high 14 rushing attempts. Smith's value will come mostly via the pass game where he turned five targets into five receptions for 42 receiving yards. Smith is a priority add in all PPR leagues.Chimere Dike, WR, TitansDike was the first receiver the Titans drafted this past May after drafting Cam Ward, but he fell behind on the depth chart this offseason. However, he offers an over-the-top type speed that fits Ward's arm talent. With Calvin Ridley out, Dike got his opportunity in Week 7 and turned four receptions into 70 yards and a touchdown. Daniel Bellinger, TE, Giants Bellinger helped kickstart the Giants pass game in Week 7 and finished with 88 yards receiving and a touchdown on three receptions. Bellinger came inches away from hauling in his second touchdown pass later that game. With the Giants dealing with so many injuries on the receiver front, Bellinger could emerge as a favorite target for Dart. \nJoe Flacco, QB, BengalsThis Flacco-Bengals thing sure looks it's going to work out. Flacco lit the Steelers up for 342 passing yards and three touchdowns in Week 7. Flacco should be added in all leagues where you need quarterback help. In the right matchup, he can easily find himself as a top-12 option given the receivers he has to work with, the way the Bengals call their offense, and the state of the Bengals defense. \n            ",

The reigning Offensive Rookie of the Year got sacked by Shemar James, fumbled and went to the ground holding the back of his right leg. After limping off the field, he went into the blue medical tent, and then he jogged off the field and down the tunnel.He was initially ruled questionable to return, and Marcus Mariota took over on the ensuing drive. Daniels was later ruled out. After the game, coach Dan Quinn said Daniels will undergo an MRI on his hamstring Monday. Quinn also said Daniels wanted to re-enter the game.\nDaniels has already missed two games this season due to the knee sprain he suffered in Week 2 against the Green Bay Packers, though that injury was to his left leg. He has been wearing a brace on that knee ever since.Mariota started both games Daniels missed earlier this year and played well, throwing for a touchdown and running for another in a win over the Las Vegas Raiders and throwing for two more touchdowns in a loss to the Atlanta Falcons.\nWashington, now 3-4, was already without its three top wide receivers -- Terry McLaurin, Deebo Samuel and Noah Brown -- entering the game and has been hit hard by injuries on both sides of the ball this season.\n            \n    ",

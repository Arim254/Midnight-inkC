    "description": "\n        It's been less than a week since Luciano Spalletti was appointed as the new Juventus head coach, replacing Igor Tudor and becoming the club's",
    "body": "\n        It's been less than a week since Luciano Spalletti was appointed as the new Juventus head coach, replacing Igor Tudor and becoming the club's third managerial change since the summer of 2024. Since the former Napoli and Italy manager was appointed, Juventus won 2-1 against Cremonese over the weekend away and then drew 1-1 at the Allianz Stadium in Turin against Sporting CP on Tuesday in the Champions League in the first home game of the new coach. In the opening two matches under Spalletti, Juventus scored three goals but also conceded two, marking some defensive issues of the Italian giants that are still looking to improve under the new manager, who didn't have much time to fix the ongoing problems. However, there was a big and immediate change: a new tactical position of Teun Koopmeiners, who played both matches under Spalletti as a left center back. The Dutch midfielder joined Juventus from Atalanta in the summer of 2024 for around $50 million, becoming one of the highest-paid players in the history of the iconic Italian club. The pressure was really high on him in his first season and he didn't deliver as much as he hoped, scoring only five goals in 44 matches played, while the season before, he scored 15 goals in all competitions under Gian Piero Gasperini at Atalanta, in what was his best season of his career so far. Under Thiago Motta and later Tudor, Koopmeiners was deployed in several midfield roles: as a central midfielder, an attacking midfielder, and occasionally as a second striker behind the main forward. However, none of these positions truly suited his qualities or allowed him to perform at his best.\nWhen Spalletti joined Juventus, he immediately decided to deconstruct his role and started him in both games against Cremonese and Sporting CP as a left center back, a player who can not only defend but also start the attack. It's no coincidence that Koopmeiners was second with the most touches on Tuesday (74) and led the team in passes attempted (63). He had just one touch fewer than Manuel Locatelli (75), showing how equally involved he was in Juventus' build-up play and overall possession. Speaking to Sky Italy after the game, he said he feels confident playing in the new role.\"I feel very comfortable in this position. I'm not the kind of forward who plays with his back to goal, as I've had to do in some other matches and I've told the club that as well. I feel much better in this role. It's the one I also played back in the Netherlands. I like to drive forward with the ball,\" he said. \nKoopmeiners (8) saw plenty of the ball and successfully helped create attacking moments with his ball movement.   \n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            As the Dutch midfielder said to Sky Italy, this is not something new for him. In the 154 matches played for AZ Alkmaar in his career before moving to Atalanta in 2021, he played 38 matches as a center back in a similar position of the one he's currently playing at Juventus. It will be interesting to see whether Spalletti decides to keep him in that role, as the coach values defenders who can play out from the back, contribute creatively, and offer an additional source of build-up quality. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 NFL trade deadline has come and gone, and we saw several big names that were moved. The New York Jets sent cornerback Sauce Gardner to the Indianapolis Colts and defensive tackle Quinnen Williams to the Dallas Cowboys, while Las Vegas Raiders wideout Jakobi Meyers is on his way to the Jacksonville Jaguars. One big name that was not moved, however, was Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver A.J. Brown. While the Eagles were active in acquiring players such as pass rusher Jaelan Phillips and cornerbacks Michael Carter II and Jaire Alexander, there was speculation Brown could be traded given the fact he was apparently unhappy with his role in Philly's offense earlier in the year. But all the noise was just that: noise. During a Tuesday press conference, Eagles general manager Howie Roseman was asked about Brown, and if he entertained any offers for the star pass-catcher. Roseman said teams pursuing the Lombardi Trophy don't move on from talented players like Brown.\n\"I think that when you're trying to be a great team, it's hard to trade great players, and A.J. Brown's a great player. He wears the 'C' for a reason. He's an important part of this team, of this organization. He cares about winning, he cares about his teammates, and I think that when you're a team like ours that is looking forward to an opportunity to compete for a championship, you just don't get rid of guys like that. We feel very lucky to have him on our team and excited about the second half of the season with him.\"The Eagles were on a bye last week, and Brown actually missed the Week 8 victory against the New York Giants due to a hamstring injury, but Philly's passing game has gotten back on track in recent weeks. In the Week 7 victory against the Minnesota Vikings, Jalen Hurts posted a perfect passer rating while Brown caught four passes for a season-high 121 yards and two touchdowns. It was Brown's first multi-touchdown game since 2023. \n        \n            \n                2025 NFL trade deadline winners and losers: Jets smartly stockpile for overhaul; Colts, Cowboys overpay?\n                \n                    Cody Benjamin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBrown and DeVonta Smith combined for 304 yards and three touchdowns vs. the Vikings, the second-most receiving yards they have combined for in their four seasons teammates. The duo averaged 99.2 receiving yards per game in the first six weeks of the season, but this passing attack may have turned over a new leaf. \nTo Roseman's point, contenders do not part ways with elite talent -- and Brown is an elite talent. There were certainly questions about this offense earlier in the season, but at 6-2, the Eagles look poised to repeat as top dogs in the NFC East and defend their title as Super Bowl champion.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Parc des Princes was the scene of a wild one on Tuesday as Bayern Munich won 2-1 over PSG to extend their unbeaten start to of the season to 16 games, all wins. It's a major result for Vincent Kompany's team, and in defeating the defending champions of Europe at their home, it's arguably the biggest win of Kompany's Bayern Munich career.Looking to bring Bayern their first UCL title since 2020, Kompany has his team on the right track in what could be a record-breaking campaign. Harry Kane has been the center of attention with his 22 goals in all competitions, but facing PSG while finishing with 10 men was a moment to showcase the defensive improvement after the addition of Jonathan Tah from Bayer Leverkusen. Bayern didn't make many transfers during the summer, but in the additions of Tah and Luis Diaz, they've been impactful ones.Time will show if this is the season for Bayern to make it back to the top of Europe, but they're on the right track now.Injuries mount for Paris Saint-GermainJust when Luis Enrique's team was getting their midfield back together with Joao Neves making the bench, quickly setbacks were suffered. Ballon d'Or winner Ousmane Dembele left the match after only 25 minutes with what seemed like a hamstring injury. Dembele was only making his second start since returning from a thigh injury, which caused him to miss seven matches in all competitions, and now he'll likely be sidelined again. The Frenchman is critical to everything that PSG do, and with Desire Doue also nursing an injury, it leaves the club quite light up top. There was another injury during the match to Achraf Hakimi, who went off after a reckless challenge from Luis Diaz. The severity of Hakimi's injury is unknown, but when he is able to get forward with ease while also defending, it's quite a blow for the Parisians. Speaking of Diaz...\nTwo ends of the spectrum for Luis DiazWith a brace in the first 35 minutes of the match, Luis Diaz showed how much his signing has meant to Bayern's unbeaten start to the season. Capping off a counterattack with speed, Diaz beat Lucas Chevalier for a goal before taking the ball off Marquinhos to put Bayern up 2-0. Near the end of the half, it was his tackle on Hakimi that almost cost Bayern their victory. After a review, his yellow card was upgraded to a red, but Kompany made adjustments to keep his side on the front foot. \nAfter the half, another one of those summer signings, Tom Biischof, entered for Serge Gnabry to keep the pace in the midfield. Kane also had to press more and play as a target man as Bayern did their best to limit PSG while Manuel Neuer did what he could, facing eight shots on target in the second half and only getting beaten by one.A shift for the German giantsAttacking has never been the issue for Bayern, but even under Kompany, defense has been their issue in major matches. After already taking care of Chelsea in Champions League play and now following it up with a victory away to PSG, it's impossible to ignore Bayern's credentials. Of the teams who have played four games in the league phase, only Real Madrid, Tottenham, and Arsenal have allowed fewer goals than Bayern's three. Add that alongside their high powered attack, and it's easy to see how Kompany's men are brushing aside everything in their path. Bayern are now the top scoring team in the league phase alongside PSG after this result. \nMixing in youngsters like Aleksandar Pavlovic and Lennart Karl, Bayern are also improving their depth for the long run, which will help if any injuries crop up going forward. It's easy to forget that Bayern are doing this without Jamal Musiala and already performing as one of the world's best teams. They can take another step forward when he comes back, and that's a scary proposition. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        That Dominik Szoboszlai has been one of Liverpool's best players this season, perhaps their best, is not really up for debate. What made Tuesday by far the campaign's outstanding performance was how the Hungarian's presence at the heart of the side enabled so many others to be their best selves.Szoboszlai was all things to Arne Slot. Out of possession, his industry set the tone for the sort of diligence that is required if you are going to hold Real Madrid goalless. This was a Liverpool display of real commitment and organization, a collective willingness to sacrifice that has too rarely been seen since the half-billion-dollar splurge on new signings. That is probably not down to any lack of willingness on the part of the summer arrivals, more a lack of reference points who can define their approach.Their No. 8 was like a lighthouse for the rest of this team. A cutback to the edge of the Liverpool area? There was Szoboszlai to boot the ball clear. A counter down the wing? You could rest assured that the support run would be coming from the Hungarian with the alice band. Every time there was a question to be asked of Thibaut Courtois, you could be sure that Szoboszlai would be involved in its posing. He drew the best save of the first half, his unerring set-piece delivery teed up plenty of his teammates to test the Real Madrid No. 1.Eventually, it became too much for Courtois, beaten on the hour when a header flew off Alexis Mac Allister at close range. All the Argentine had to do is meet the fizzing cross from, well, you guessed who. No one carried the ball more frequently than Szoboszlai, no one took more shots and only Florian Wirtz created more chances. That last statistic is telling too. His teammates were better for having Szoboszlai back where he is at his best.\nWide on the left, it no longer fell on Wirtz to drop into midfield and aid the build-up. Over recent years, there have been few more devastating talents in the final third than the German, but he has spent too much of his early weeks in England dropping deep to aid Liverpool's clunky, Trent Alexander-Arnold-less ball progression. This time, he held court in that inside left spot outside the box where he is at his best.Further back, Mac Allister and Ryan Gravenberch got into a familiar groove, the latter exceptional in his eye for an interception and ability to carry upfield. And when the defense begins at the front of the pitch, it becomes all the easier for the back four to impose themselves in their individual duels, as Conor Bradley did quite outstandingly up against Vinicius Junior.It helped Liverpool no end that Madrid were so tepid, not the first time that it has felt like Xabi Alonso has veered towards caution against a high-grade opponent. La Liga's leaders were too eager to drag the tempo of the game down but ultimately achieved nothing more than wasting long spells of possession before Liverpool turned the pace up. Arda Guler was nothing like his usual self, instead far more subdued in his positioning. The dynamism of Federico Valverde might have helped; instead the hosts dubbed him the weak link in defense with a host of passes going from right to left to get Wirtz isolated against a midfielder masquerading as a right back.\nIt wasn't only without the ball that Madrid missed Alexander-Arnold, whose return to the Anfield stage in the 82nd minute was greeted with a chorus of boos. The visitors had a devastating front three of Jude Bellingham, Vinicius and Kylian Mbappe, all of whom flashed threat on occasion but lacked the service to exert pressure. Slot could doubtless have told his counterpart that Alexander-Arnold's more presence in an XI is usually a guarantee of ball progression from which forwards can feast.Without any means of unlocking their attackers, Madrid turned out a performance not that dissimilar to their Merseyside trip last season. On that day, they had the big names too but had no answer for a true team like Liverpool's.Frankly, this was a vision of how the English champions should have come back to defend their crowns, much more than the muddled mess that came when they couldn't bring themselves to choose between Hugo Ekitike and Alexander Isak. This was the side that Slot forged into comfortably England's finest in 2024-25 but with the necessary upgrades and tweaks required. A midfield of Szoboszlai's verve, Mac Allister's precision and Gravenberch's control was never a problem. It proved Tuesday to be a weapon capable of blowing Madrid out of the water.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The New Orleans Pelicans expected to take a step forward in the 2025-26 season, as evidenced by trading their unprotected 2026 draft pick to the Atlants Hawks so they could select Derik Queen with the No. 10 pick in June. Two weeks into the season, nothing has gone according to plan for the Pelicans, who are one of the last two winless teams in the NBA at 0-6. Adding to the dreadful vibes of a winless start is Tuesday's news that Zion Williamson will miss at least 7-10 days with a Grade 1 hamstring strain. Given Williamson's injury history, there's plenty of concern that a hamstring strain could linger or get aggravated again later, creating additional stress for Pelicans fans. New Orleans' 0-6 start has featured three losses by 30-plus points, resulting in the league's worst net rating at a staggering -18.3. That performance has led to rumblings that coach Willie Green has lost the locker room and his seat gets hotter with each loss. Losing Williamson -- the team's leader in points, rebounds, assists and blocks per game -- won't add much optimism that they'll suddenly turn things around. \n\n        \n            \n                NBA Hater Report: Pelicans are a disaster, Ja Morant can't shoot, why Warriors struggle without Draymond\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhy Zion Williamson is so important to PelicansWilliamson is the most important player on a New Orleans roster that has plenty of issues, namely a frontcourt that was already thin on size and heavily reliant on Wililamson. Kevon Looney made his debut in a blowout loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder, providing some help for Yves Missi and Queen, but both of the Pelicans' young centers are light on size (especially Queen). Given their lack of bulk in the paint, it comes as little surprise New Orleans has been one of the league's worst rebounding teams and ranks last in defensive rating. Without Williamson, Green will likely have to see what Queen can do in extended minutes. The rookie has only played 17.5 minutes per game in the first six contests off the bench, but his ability to score is something none of their other frontcourt options provide. Elsewhere, the Pelicans will need Trey Murphy III to shake out of his early slump to play like a star-level talent and Jordan Poole figures to take on an even bigger role in the offense. \nHow long could Pelicans' winless streak last?None of that provides an awful lot of encouragement and with Williamson missing at least the next four games, if not more, it's fair to wonder when the Pelicans' first win will arrive. Tuesday night figures to be their best chance against a Charlotte Hornets team that will be without LaMelo Ball (ankle) and Brandon Miller (shoulder). But with Williamson now absent, New Orleans is only a short favorite (-2.5 at FanDuel). If they don't win against the Hornets, a three-game road trip awaits before Zion could potentially return. 11/4: vs. Hornets 11/5: at Dallas Mavericks11/8: at San Antonio Spurs11/10: at Phoenix Suns11/12: vs. Portland Trail BlazersIf they cannot win one of those five games, with Dallas, Phoenix and Portland all looking beatable in the early going this season, then the Pelicans' losing streak could stretch on for a very long time even once Williamson returns. The rest of their November schedule is pretty brutal and filled with West contenders. Their most winnable games the rest of the month will be against Atlanta, Dallas (again) and the Memphis Grizzlies. \nIf they somehow can't get any of those games, Dec. 6 against the league's other winless squad, the Brooklyn Nets, could be a titanic battle of basketball inferiority. The key difference being the Nets are actively tanking after trading to get their draft picks back, while the Pelicans are trying their hardest to win because they have no incentive to lose with their pick belonging to the Hawks. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Kansas City Royals are keeping their captain around another two years. The Royals have signed catcher Salvador Perez to a two-year contract extension through the 2027 season, the team announced Tuesday. The deal is worth $25 million and includes some deferrals, per MLB.com. The extension replaces Perez's $13.5 million club option for 2026. \"Salvy  is a Royals legend and one of the most important players this franchise  has ever had,\" GM J.J. Picollo said in a statement.  \"We had the option for next year, but everyone knew we wanted  to make sure his legacy with us continued longer than that. We  appreciate Salvy's commitment to the Royals, and we're just as excited  as our fans.\" \nNow 35, had another productive season in 2025, slashing .236/.284/.446 with 30 home runs in 641 plate appearances. The on-base percentage is an eyesore, though Perez has never been a big on-base player, and the overall production is very good for someone who spends most of his time behind the plate. His catcher defense is passable more than an asset at this point. Perez should pass Hall of Famer George Brett for the most home runs in Royals history sometime in 2026. He has 303 and Brett retired with 317. No other Royal has hit even 200 homers. Also, Perez could become only the third player in team history to appear in 2,000 games. He's at 1,707 games. Only Brett (2,707) and Frank White (2,324) on the franchise leaderboard.\nThe two-year extension ensures the Royals will keep Perez alongside Bobby Witt Jr., All-Star third baseman Maikel Garcia, and ace Cole Ragans through 2027, which will be prime contention years for a Kansas City team that went to the postseason in 2024. The AL Central is winnable and it would more difficult to win the division without Perez than with him. That all said, Perez's new contract does great some questions about his future defensive home, and also the team's bevy of catcher prospects. Here are a few things Kansas City must now sort out with Perez locked up through 2027.  Where will Perez play? Since 2000, only seven players have caught 170 games during their age 36-37 seasons, and only one has done it since 2009: A.J. Pierzynski (195 games from 2013-14). Even with the one-knee catching stance reducing wear and tear, catcher is usually a young player's position. It is no surprise then that the Royals have cut back on Perez's catching workload the last few years. \nHere is the breakdown of Perez's starts by position since the shortened pandemic season in 2020:  CatcherFirst baseDH2021 \t\t\t\t75% \t\t\t\t0 \t\t\t\t25% \t\t\t\t2022 \t\t\t\t65% \t\t\t\t0 \t\t\t\t35% \t\t\t\t2023 \t\t\t\t64% \t\t\t\t15% \t\t\t\t21% \t\t\t\t2024 \t\t\t\t57% \t\t\t\t28% \t\t\t\t15% \t\t\t\t2025 \t\t\t\t57% \t\t\t\t18% \t\t\t\t25% \t\t\t\tThe trend is clear. Fewer starts at catcher, more at first base and DH. Expect that to continue these next two years, perhaps to the point where Perez starts fewer than half his games behind the plate come 2027. Less time at catcher will put a bit more pressure on Perez's bat, though his power plays at any position, plus he brings off-the-charts intangibles and leadership. Something along the lines of 50% starts at catcher with 25% at first base and 25% at DH seems reasonable enough. That would still give Vinnie Pasquantino most of the playing time at first base. Perez will still catch a lot. That much is clear. He's just unlikely to carry the enormous workloads he had earlier in his career. It's time to scale back in an effort to keep him healthy and productive. What about those catcher prospects? One of them, Carter Jensen, made his MLB debut in September and impressed, hitting .300/.391/.550 with three home runs in 20 games. In those 20 games Carter split his workload evenly: 10 games at catcher and 10 at DH. The 22-year-old is Kansas City's top prospect, per MLB Pipeline, and a big part of their future. He and Perez will again share catcher/DH time in 2026. Jensen is not the Royals' only touted catcher prospect, however. Blake Mitchell, their 2023 first-round pick, is a consensus top 100 prospect. Ramon Ramirez is regarded as one of their 10 best prospects as well. He's also a catcher. The Royals have Perez under contract through 2027 plus three well-regarded catcher prospects in the system. How do they handle this? For starters, this is not something the Royals have to figure out right now. Jensen and Perez can coexist on the MLB roster and neither Mitchell nor Ramirez have played a game above Single-A. They're still at least one year away from the big leagues, likely more given the steep development curve for catchers. Perez and Mitchell/Ramirez may never be on the same MLB roster! Also, catchers are always valuable trade chips. If the Royals decide Jensen is their guy long-term, they can use Mitchell and/or Ramirez to get help elsewhere on the roster (outfield, hint hint). Mitchell, Ramirez, and even Jensen are hardly proven commodities. If the Royals find themselves with too many good catchers in a year or two, they should celebrate, not worry. The Royals went 82-80 in 2025 but were better in the second half (35-30) than the first (47-50). With better health and a few new outfielders, Kansas City can return to the postseason in 2026. The hardest part of the building the roster is done. They have their foundation in Garcia, Pasquantino, Perez, Ragans, and Witt. Now they just have to upgrade the supporting cast. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 trade deadline provided the NFL's most action-packed trade deadline of the 21st centuryTwenty-seven players were traded in season in 2025, the most during a year in the past 25 seasons. Three first-round picks changed hands and went over to the New York Jets in their star-studded moves that shipped All-Pro cornerback Sauce Gardner to the Indianapolis Colts and All-Pro defensive tackle Quinnen Williams to the Dallas Cowboys. The 2025 Jets are the only two in the last 45 years to trade two former first team All-Pros in the same day, per CBS Sports Research. With roster around the league solidified with the traded deadline now in the past, here's a look at which NFL teams improved the most, and which teams should have picked up the phone. Who improved the most\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Dallas CowboysThe Cowboys entered the 2025 NFL trade deadline with a defense that has played like hot garbage through the first half of the season. They're allowing the second-most points per game (30.8 points per game) in the league. They're also the second-worst third down defense (52.6% third down conversion rate allowed) in the last 50 years ahead of only the 1982 Kansas City Chiefs (52.8%). \nOne can certainly argue about the price the Cowboys paid (a 2026 second-round pick, better of Cowboys and Packers 2027 first-round pick and DT Mazi Smith) to acquire New York Jets All-Pro defensive tackle Quinnen Williams. However, it's inarguable that the 27-year-old All-Pro can make a major impact for Dallas in both the run game and the pass game. Williams' 40.0 career sacks are the third-most among 300-pound players since he joined the NFL as the third overall draft pick in the 2019 NFL Draft. He can also shine against the run since his 13 runs stuffs for a loss or no gain are the second-most in the NFL this season, according to Next Gen Stats via NFL Research. Adding veteran linebacker Logan Wilson in exchange for a seventh-round pick is a nice flier on a player who could at least send the struggling Kenneth Murray and Jack Sanborn to the bench.New York Jets\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    The 2025 New York Jets (1-7) are the only team with multiple in-season trades for first-round picks in the past 25 seasons. New York isn't one of the most improved teams on paper today, but they are one of the league's most improved teams in terms of their future outlook. They now have two first-round picks and two second-round picks in 2026 and a whopping three first-round picks in 2027. There's obviously the mystery element with who they end up picking, but they should be able to fill out their roster nicely over the next two years. \nIndianapolis Colts\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    The Indianapolis Colts are currently the AFC's No. 1 seed with a 7-2 record in large part to having the best scoring offense in football (32.2 points per game). Defensively, Indianapolis had some holes. They enter Week 10 ranked 26th in pass defense (244.8 passing yards per game allowed), 29th in third down defense (45.7% third down conversion rate allowed) and dead last in passing yards per game allowed outside the numbers (152.2 passing yards per game allowed). That weakness was shaping up to be a problem, especially if they're looking at facing quarterbacks like Josh Allem, Patrick Mahomes, Aaron Rodgers, Justin Herbert and potentially Lamar Jackson in the postseason. They paid a steep price for a 25-year-old All-Pro in cornerback Sauce Gardner, but he helps fix Indianapolis' Achilles Heel. He's forced a tight window throw on 52% of the passes thrown his way, the highest rate of any player targeted at least 20 times in coverage per Next Gen Stats, via NFL Research.   \nIf Daniel Jones proves his five-turnover performance at the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 9 was just an aberration and not an omen of things to come, the Colts are a real deal Super Bowl contender. Seattle Seahawks\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    The Seattle Seahawks just gave quarterback Sam Darnold, who leads the NFL with a 9.6 yards per pass attempt average, one of the best deep receiving wide receivers in the league by trading for Rashid Shaheed from the New Orleans Saints. Shaheed has 11 career touchdowns of 40 or more yards since 2022, the third-most in the league in that span behind only two All-Pros in Tyreek Hill (12) and Ja'Marr Chase (13).Shaheed was also coached by current Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak in New Orleans last year. Seattle has a shiny new weapon for Darnold to go along with 2025 NFL receiving yards leader Jaxon Smith-Njigba (948 yards receiving) and 2021 NFL Offensive Player of the Year wide receiver Cooper Kupp. The Seahawks' passing game capabilities are now up there with the NFL's best. \nWho should have made movesKansas City Chiefs\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    The Kansas City Chiefs needed help at the running back position. Their running backs have combined to rank 28th in the league in scrimmage yards per game and 27th in the league in scrimmage yards per touch. The New York Jets ran a fire sale on most of their core, and running back Breece Hall, who is in the last year of his rookie deal, would have made so much sense for the Chiefs. Hall is one of three active players averaging over 60 yards rushing per game and 30 yards receiving per game for their career along with  Bijan Robinson and Christian McCaffrey. Big miss by the defending AFC champs. Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Baker Mayfield looks like one of the league's best, but his ceiling could be limited in the playoffs because of his offensive line's durability. Both guard Cody Mauch and offensive tackle Luke Goedeke are on injured reserve, and three of his five offensive linemen have missed at least three games this season. \nCleveland Browns guard Joel Bitonio, one of Mayfield's former blockers in Cleveland, would have made perfect sense. He is one of five players with a Pro Bowl selection in each of the last seven seasons, and he's only missed two games in the last nine seasons. The 2025 season is also a contract year for him, so Bitonio could have been had for cheap. That's a big miss by the Buccaneers front office. Buffalo Bills \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    The Buffalo Bills (6-2) have a clear area of need on both sides of the ball. Quarterback Josh Allen needs receiver help: he is averaging the shortest average pass length targeting wide receivers (8.5) in the NFL this season despite his rocket launcher right arm. Wide receiver Keon Coleman has taken a big step back this season: he's averaging just 9.8 yards per catch this year after producing a 19.2 yards per catch average a season ago. That's the largest year-over-year decrease (-9.4) by any player since 2000, minimum 35 targets. Allen needs a deep ball target badly. Buffalo's defense is also rough in terms of their run defense: they rank 31st in the NFL in yards per carry allowed this season (5.4), and defensive tackle Ed Oliver is out indefinitely with a torn biceps injury. Defensive tackle depth remains a critical issue for the Bills.  \n            ",

Just over a month remains until the final College Football Playoff bracket is selected, so OSU will need to hold off not only the Hoosiers but the rest of the top 25 if it aims to retain the top seed in the postseason.Off to a dominant start this year with wins over Texas and Illinois, the reigning national champion Buckeyes are seeking their seventh playoff appearance in 12 years of the postseason bracket's existence (2014, 2016, 2019-20, 2022, 2024).Eight of the 11 teams ranked No. 1 in a season's initial CFP Rankings ultimately reached the playoff, an effort now made easier with the expanded 12-team field being contested for a second season.Ohio State is in a strong position to go wire to wire, standing 8-0 (5-0 Big Ten) with only one game remaining against a ranked opponent, its regular-season finale at Michigan. It will be going toe to toe atop the Big Ten with undefeated Indiana, a team whose final three opponents are a combined 7-18 on the season, 0-16 in Big Ten play.\nTexas A&M, Alabama and Georgia round out the rest of the top five.There was not a Group of Five program ranked in Tuesday's release. With the 12-team playoff model granting automatic bids to the five highest-ranked conference champions, the CFP Selection Committee would choose a team to take the final bid should one not otherwise be listed in the final CFP Rankings. Memphis of the American presently holds that position, according to the committee.    College Football Playoff Rankings, Nov. 4~ First-round bye | Only 11 teams in the rankings below would make the projected playoff as a Group of Five team -- the fifth automatic bid as a conference champion (Memphis) -- is not listed.Ohio State (8-0) ~Indiana (9-0) ~Texas A&M (8-0) ~Alabama (7-1) ~Georgia (7-1)Ole Miss (8-1)BYU (8-0)Texas Tech (8-1)Oregon (7-1)Notre Dame (6-2)Texas (7-2)Oklahoma (7-2)Utah (7-2)Virginia (8-1) -- No. 11 seedLouisville (7-1)Vanderbilt (7-2)Georgia Tech (8-1)Miami (FL) (6-2)USC (6-2)Iowa (6-2)Michigan (7-2)Missouri (6-2)Washington (6-2)Pittsburgh (7-2)Tennessee (6-3)\n        \n            \n                College Football Playoff Rankings reaction: Red River rivals Texas, Oklahoma sit in prime spoiler territory\n                \n                    Shehan Jeyarajah                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAnalysis by bowl expert Brad CrawfordNew metrics at workThe selection committee made it clear Tuesday that they're placing greater emphasis on wins over quality opponents this season while minimizing the reward for beating teams with sub-.500 records. This is the goal of the playoff's new \"record strength\" metric, which is designed to go beyond overall records and provide deeper reasoning for where teams are slotted and why. Essentially, record strength is how well an average top 25 team plays against their schedule compared to others. No arguments here for the teams in the Nos. 1 and 2 spots -- Ohio State and Indiana. Based on eye test, both of those teams look like college football's two titans through Week 10.\nDrama brewing in ACC?Surprise, surprise in the ACC. No. 14 Virginia (8-1) and No. 15 Louisville (7-1) being ranked ahead of Georgia Tech (8-1) and Miami (6-2) was stunning given the Hurricanes' handful of notable, early season wins. Neither the Yellow Jackets nor Hurricanes are viewed as two of college football's elite in the eyes of the selection committee, at least not at the moment. That will change if Georgia Tech wins out and takes a rivalry weekend matchup with Georgia, but for now, Saturday's loss to NC State clearly damaged their stock in this first poll. No team Georgia Tech has beaten this season is ranked, and the only wins against FBS teams with winning records have come against Temple, Wake Forest and Duke. Miami fumbles early leg upSelection committee protocol states \"when circumstances at the margins indicate that teams are comparable,\" then head-to-head is part of the criteria that must be taken into consideration. However, it's obvious No. 18 Miami is not viewed on the same pedestal as 10th-ranked Notre Dame despite beating the Fighting Irish in the season opener, which eliminates that head-to-head notion. If Notre Dame wins out, that means the Fighting Irish would be riding a 10-game winning streak into the postseason with added quality victories against Navy and Pitt in November. Miami has opportunities to beat a pair of quality teams as well, the nationally ranked Panthers included, but it's not going to matter for the Hurricanes with three ACC teams ahead of them. When teams are comparable, strength of schedule and comparative outcomes of common opponents are two factors to watch during final deliberations. Unfortunately for Miami, this selection committee has already KO'd Mario Cristobal's team.Texas A&M in a good spotIn the SEC, the selection committee appreciates unblemished Texas A&M. The Aggies' strength of schedule is outside the top 10, while the overall toughness of Alabama's slate sits at No. 4. The Aggies have three wins over teams with winning records -- Notre Dame, LSU and Mississippi State -- while the Crimson Tide have four. Texas A&M's not in danger of falling behind Alabama in these CFP Rankings should both teams win out and meet in Atlanta for the SEC championship given what's left for the Aggies -- two games against ranked teams along with South Carolina and Samford.\nRemember the committee's subjective factorWhat goes on behind the scenes with the process is not public, only the rankings, along with a few details here and there from playoff chair Mack Rhoades during weekly television appearances justifying the poll. This might explain why one-loss Oregon is ranked No. 9 and behind fellow one-loss teams Ole Miss, Texas Tech and others. Oregon has only one win over an opponent with a winning record (Northwestern). Then-No. 3 Penn State tanked after losing to Oregon in double-overtime at home, but that victory has lost most -- if not all -- of its luster. To the Ducks' credit, they do sit fourth in game control and eighth in strength of record, meaning they've taken care of business as expected outside of the loss to Indiana on Oct. 11.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The most powerful team in the NFL has a 1-7 record and hasn't been to the playoffs in 14 years, which is not only the league's longest drought but also tied for the longest active postseason drought in any of the four major professional American sports.That's right -- after a trade-deadline-day teardown of epic and historic proportions, the New York Jets have the chance to control what the future holds for the next two offseasons in the NFL.First-year general manager Darren Mougey made seismic moves Tuesday, trading cornerback Sauce Gardner to the Colts and defensive lineman Quinnen Williams to the Cowboys. The Jets received two first-round picks and wide receiver Adonai Mitchell from Indianapolis, and first- and second-round picks -- as well as defensive lineman Mazi Smith -- from Dallas.Gardner, 25, is one of three players to be on the All-Pro First Team each of his first two NFL seasons. The Jets rightfully viewed him as a cornerstone of the franchise just four months ago when they made him the NFL's highest-paid cornerback with a four-year, $120.4 million contract extension.\nWilliams, 27, who has made each of the last three Pro Bowls, also seemed to be part of that formula. His contract runs through 2027.The Jets had to get appropriate return for these players, and they did. It's the first time this millennium that a team has made multiple in-season trades for first-round picks. New York now has two 2026 first-rounders, two 2026 second-rounders and three 2027 first-rounders.There's plenty of chatter already about what New York could do with that haul. Quarterback is atop the list after Justin Fields has become the latest in a series of experiments that didn't work.\nRestocking the defense -- which was near the bottom of the league even before these trades and also struggled last year -- will be a major priority, too. The same will be said for filling skill position players beyond Garrett Wilson, whom the Jets were reportedly resolute in not trading.Perhaps that's the greatest advantage, though. The Jets are a blank slate. They don't have to address one position or another. If they're not satisfied with what's available to them at quarterback in the 2026 draft -- where they could pick first -- they don't have to go with one. They can build in the trenches or in the secondary or at wide receiver or ... anywhere. They could bring in a bridge quarterback and refocus on 2027.And my goodness, what a loaded 2027 class it is. The names there are enough to pique the interested of even the most curmudgeonly -- and they have plenty of reasons to be curmudgeonly -- Jets fan. Wide receivers Jeremiah Smith (Ohio State) and Ryan Williams (Alabama). Edge rushers Dylan Stewart (South Carolina) and Colin Simmons (Texas). Maybe suddenly resurgent Texas quarterback Arch Manning, gets there, too.\nAgain, the excitement shouldn't be focusing on whom, exactly, the Jets will draft, but the simple fact that they'll have ample opportunities to choose a direction here. The world is their oyster. Adding to their power is an important note: The 2027 first-round pick acquired from Dallas is the better of the Cowboys' own 2027 selection, and the one it acquired from the Packers in the Micah Parsons deal.There's a real chance that it's a top-half-of-the-first-round pick. This is a seemingly minor detail that could be a major difference. It's an NBA-esque trade where the \"first-round pick\" notation requires much more detail.New York Jets General Manager Darren Mougey and Jets Head Coach Aaron Glenn, shake hands as they pose for the press, at the Atlantic Health Jets Training Center, Monday, January 27, 2025, in Florham Park. Mougey and Glenn were introduced to the press in their new positions for the first time. \n                                                                    © Kevin R. Wexler-NorthJersey.com / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images\n                                                            Returning to the curmudgeonly Jets fan, they may point out that this has happened before. In fact, the Jets are the most recent team to make five picks in a two-year span, doing so in 2021-22.\nThat stretch is looked at as a failure because they missed on Zach Wilson, but they also hit on Gardner, Wilson and potentially still Jermaine Johnson II.\"The Jets are doomed to repeat mistakes forever and ever until the end of time,\" our hypothetical Jets fan says.That's wrong. The Jets of today and tomorrow aren't doomed to make the mistakes of the Jets of yesterday simply because of the name on the front of the jersey. If that were true, no bad team would ever get better.\nMougey deserves some leash, benefit of the doubt and perhaps even credit -- I know that's hard to grasp, Jets fans -- for his savvy moves. If the Jets stand pat with their five first-round picks -- again, a big \"if\" considering how many paths they could take -- it will be the 13th time since the merger that a team makes five first-round picks in a two-year span. The Dolphins, Raiders and Browns also did it in the past decade, and all three made the postseason shortly thereafter. Cleveland even ended a playoff drought longer than the Jets' current one.The blueprint would be the 1991-92 Cowboys, who added foundational pieces to their 1990s dynasty in first-round picks Russell Maryland, Alvin Harper, Kevin Smith and Robert Jones and second-rounder Darren Woodson.In all likelihood, the Jets will fall somewhere in between. There will be hits, and there will be misses. Where they can't miss is quarterback. The \"With great power comes great responsibility\" quote applies here. Mougey, coach Aaron Glenn and the rest of the Jets have great power. They also have great responsibility to get it right.\nAt least they're giving themselves a legitimate chance. The Jets asking for more patience when they already own the NFL's longest active playoff drought is difficult but necessary. The days of trying to make Fields work or acceding to Aaron Rodgers' every wish -- impatient, one-foot-in, one-foot-out moves that put the Jets in this spot in the first place -- or hoping for Sam Darnold or Wilson to be the franchise savior amid hopeless conditions are over.The board has been wiped clean. There are no excuses, and there can be no looking back. Trades like these don't happen without an owner's permission, either; Woody Johnson seemingly being on board and in line with the patient approach is massively important, too.New York can transform its organization. It can select a highly drafted quarterback and provide a viable ecosystem around him. It can replenish a defense badly in need of talent all over. It can bring in veterans to help: New York is projected to have the third-most salary cap this offseason. All of these things weren't possible before Tuesday's deadline deals.\nThe teardown is near complete. The rebuild can begin in earnest. The Jets' playoff drought will continue this year. Maybe it's not over next year or the year after.But the Jets are finally doing things the right way, finally trying to build a team from the ground up rather than plugging in holes here or there. For an impatient franchise and fan base, patience isn't easy. But it might just be worth it.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        LSU had an eventful week that thrust the athletic department into chaos. But after a week of turmoil, the new power structure at the school has begun to clarify. Back-to-back losses led to the firing of football coach Brian Kelly, which was followed by an attention-grabbing press conference from governor Jeff Landry insisting athletic director Scott Woodward would not be involved in the hire of Kelly's replacement. Woodward was then fired later in the week. All the while, LSU was still without a university president. This week, Wade Rousse left McNeese State to become LSU's new president and his first order of business was to elevate interim athletic director Verge Ausberry to the full-time position, sources told CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz. Ausberry played linebacker at LSU and has spent the past 24 years in the athletic department, including the last six as the executive deputy athletic director. His hire doesn't come without some controversy, as he was suspended back in 2021 for his role in improperly handling complaints of physical and sexual abuse levied against LSU athletes. \n        \n            \n                The Politics of Purple and Gold: How Gov. Jeff Landry's power play took down LSU's AD -- and what comes next\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLandry's brash, boastful press conference in which he went after Woodward and Jimmy Sexton, the most powerful coaching agent in the business, made many wonder if the LSU job would be all that desirable to coaches given the apparent power vacuum at the school that the governor seemed more than happy to fill. A week later, with Rousse now in place as president, LSU seems determined to show some stability and order to tamp down those concerns about who was in charge of what in Baton Rouge -- something Ausberry alluded to in an interview with 104.5 ESPN in Baton Rouge on Tuesday. \n\"That alignment means a lot,\" Ausberry said. \"And if you don't have leadership, you have a void there, it really, really hurts you out there going out in the market. People want to know who they report to and who they answer to. That's very, very important in our system.\"Verge Ausberry lays out vision for LSU coaching searchAusberry's decades in Baton Rouge give him plenty of sway with other powerful figures at the school and plenty of support within the football program, which he's worked most closely with in his time in the athletic department. By moving quickly to get the school and athletic department's leadership vacancies filled, LSU can now begin crafting its plan for bringing in a new football coach who will come in knowing exactly what the expectations are in Baton Rouge. Making the College Football Playoff is a must and championships are the expectation. \n\"We're going to hire the best football coach there is,\" Ausberry said last Friday. \"That's our job. We are not going to let this program fail. LSU has to be in the playoffs every year in football. There's 12 teams that make it. It's going to expand here. We have to be one of those teams at LSU. No substitute.\"To get there, Ausberry laid out his vision of how the Tigers can get back to that place, noting its his job as AD (at the time interim, but now full-time) to ensure that the infrastructure is in place to support the coach so he has everything needed at his disposal to win.\"We have to make sure we have the right mechanisms in place to help that new coach, no matter who that new coach is,\" Ausberry said. \"I think the days of seeing a coach win five, six national championships, that's not going to be the same, especially with the rev sharing. We just have to make sure what we're doing here and what we have in place and the infrastructure that we have here at LSU is good enough to support the coach so that every year. Tonight the College Football Playoff [rankings] come out, so every year we need to be mentioned in that.\"\nAfter the disaster that was the Brian Kelly era, Ausberry seems to be prioritizing fit in this upcoming hiring process. Kelly never felt like a comfortable fit for LSU as a coach who built his résumé in the Midwest moving to the South, where his attempts to fit in always felt forced. \"All of these coaches can coach X's and O's,\" Ausberry said. \"They can draw it up, they can call plays, they can do all of that. But are they the right fit for the institution and are they the right fit at LSU?\"Ausberry added that they'll be looking for a coach with head-coaching experience and confirmed that they would be willing to wait for a coach to finish with the Playoff, even if it means having to go through the early signing date and running up close to the portal window. \nThat indicates LSU will largely be pursuing the biggest names on the market to fulfill those desires. And with Ausberry's interim tag removed, the school will hope to quell any questions or concerns from those candidates about who they will be answering to in the athletic department and above. \n            ",

Lassina Traore transfers in from Long Beach State, where he was a two-time All-Big West Selection and twice led the conference in rebounds. Also, the Longhorns landed Matas Vokietaitis from FAU, where the Lithuanian was the American Conference Rookie of the Year last season, averaging 10.2 points, 5.4 rebounds and knocking down 67.7% of his field goal attempts.Perhaps the biggest addition for Texas is bringing aboard coach Sean Miller, who previously served at Xavier and Arizona. He is a four-time winner of his conference's Coach of the Year award and is known for getting the most out of his players, especially on the offensive end of the court.

His twin, Cayden Boozer, is the No. 4 point guard in his class, while Duke also landed two other 5-star prospects in Nikolas Khamenia and Dame Sarr.It's not only newcomers on the Duke roster as it returns four rotation players from last year's squad which made it to the Final Four. Jon Scheyer's team covered 67.7% of its games a year ago, and the Blue Devils have also covered in two-thirds of their games versus non-conference opponents since 2023. Additionally, Duke can take solace in that Texas struggled when stepping up in competition as it went 0-5 outright versus top-10 ranked teams last season. See which team to back at SportsLine. New users can check out the latest bet365 bonus code to get $200 in bonus bets after placing a $5 bet:How to make Duke vs. Texas picksSportsLine's model has simulated Texas vs. Duke  10,000 times and is leaning Over the total, projecting 153 combined points.

    "description": "\n        Rashid Shaheed is now a member of the Seahawks, and Jakobi Meyers is now a member of the Jaguars. Those were the two big offensive trades on ",
    "body": "\n        Rashid Shaheed is now a member of the Seahawks, and Jakobi Meyers is now a member of the Jaguars. Those were the two big offensive trades on Tuesday, and Fantasy managers didn't exactly get the moves we wanted.For example, Breece Hall remained with the Jets, who seemingly traded everyone else on the roster. Hall is still worth using as a No. 2 Fantasy running back for the rest of the season, but his value could have improved if he went to a team like the Chiefs.There also was the potential of Tony Pollard being dealt, and he remained with the Titans. And no tight ends were moved even though there were rumors of potential trades for David Njoku, Chigoziem Okonkwo and Michael Mayer. The Fantasy value for all of those players remains the same for the rest of the year.For Shaheed, his Fantasy value doesn't change much going from the Saints to the Seahawks, and I still consider him a No. 3 receiver in the majority of leagues. He might score more touchdowns in Seattle with a better quarterback in Sam Darnold, and Shaheed is being reunited with offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak after the two were together in New Orleans in 2024.\nShaheed scored at least 11.8 PPR points in three of his past five games for the Saints, and his addition is a boost for Darnold. Shaheed shouldn't impact Jaxon Smith-Njigba as a top-tier Fantasy receiver, but this trade is crushing for promising rookie Tory Horton.I had Horton as a waiver-wire priority after he scored two touchdowns in Week 9 at Washington. Now, you should only add Horton in deeper leagues as a boom-or-bust No. 4 Fantasy option. Along with that, you can drop Cooper Kupp (hamstring) in the majority of leagues, especially since he might not play in Week 10 after sitting out in Week 9.For the Saints, Chris Olave gets a slight boost in value with Shaheed gone, and Olave should easily be the No. 1 option in the passing game for the rest of the season. He struggled in Tyler Shough's first start in Week 9 at the Rams with three catches for 57 yards on four targets, but prior to that he scored at least 14 PPR points in three games in a row.\nI also expect Juwan Johnson to benefit with Shaheed gone. Johnson had three catches for 31 yards and a touchdown on four targets against the Rams in Shough's first start, and Johnson has now scored at least 10.3 PPR points in three games in a row. He should be considered a low-end No. 1 Fantasy tight end in all leagues for the rest of the year.In deeper leagues, you can look at Devaughn Vele off the waiver wire, and hopefully he'll see an uptick in playing time with Shaheed gone. Vele only has five catches for 39 yards and a touchdown on 10 targets this season, but he should get more chances now with Shaheed in Seattle.In Jacksonville, Travis Hunter (knee) is on injured reserve and will miss at least three more games, and Brian Thomas Jr. (ankle) and Dyami Brown (concussion) could be out in Week 10. The Jaguars needed help, and Meyers will hopefully be a solid short-term and long-term addition.\nHe was having a down season with the Raiders prior to the trade with 33 catches for 352 yards and no touchdowns, and he scored 9.3 PPR points or less in five games in a row. Prior to this season, Meyers had averaged at least 12.9 PPR points per game in three years in a row, including a career-best 14.5 PPR points in 2024Meyers could be available in 10-team leagues and is worth adding to see what develops. If Thomas and Brown are out in Week 10 at Houston then Meyers should be a go-to option for Trevor Lawrence, and we can adjust what happens moving forward when everyone is healthy in Jacksonville. Meyers will clearly lose value when Hunter and Thomas are on the field.But even though the Jaguars acquired Meyers, I wouldn't give up adding Parker Washington. He just had eight catches for 90 yards on nine targets at Las Vegas in Week 9, and he now has 19 targets in his past two games. Lawrence will likely continue to lean on Washington, especially if Thomas and Brown are out, and Washington can be a low-end No. 3 Fantasy receiver against the Texans.\nYou can also still stash Brenton Strange, who is eligible to return from injured reserve due to a quadriceps injury in Week 11. When healthy, Strange can be a low-end starter in the majority of leagues.In Las Vegas, Tre Tucker should benefit the most with Meyers gone. He has scored at least 11.1 PPR points in three of his past six games, and he should be the No. 1 receiver and No. 2 pass catcher for the Raiders moving forward behind only Brock Bowers. Tucker should be added in all leagues where available, and he has the potential to be a No. 3 Fantasy receiver for the rest of the year.In deeper leagues, you should take a flier on rookie Jack Bech, and hopefully he'll get an uptick in playing time with Meyers gone. Bech was selected in Round 2 of the NFL Draft, and he should be part of the youth movement for the Raiders for the rest of the season. Fellow rookie Dont'e Thornton Jr. might benefit as well if you want to take a flier on him also.\nOne other trade to note was Adonai Mitchell being thrown into the Sauce Gardner deal with the Colts and Jets. Mitchell could emerge as the No. 2 receiver for the Jets this season behind Garrett Wilson, and Mitchell is worth adding in deeper leagues, as well as all dynasty formats.\n            ",

    "description": "\n        There's a strong case to be made that the 2025 NFL trade deadline is the most exciting trade deadline the league has seen in the 21st century",
    "body": "\n        There's a strong case to be made that the 2025 NFL trade deadline is the most exciting trade deadline the league has seen in the 21st century. Seriously. Twenty-seven players have been traded in season in 2025, the most during a year in the past 25 seasons. Three first-round picks have been dealt to the New York Jets in their blockbuster deals that sent All-Pro cornerback Sauce Gardner to the Indianapolis Colts and All-Pro defensive tackle Quinnen Williams to the Dallas Cowboys, making them the only team with multiple in-season trades for first-round picks in the past 25 seasons. The 2025 Jets are also the only two in the last 45 years to trade two former first team All-Pros in the same day, per CBS Sports Research. Now that the dust has settled around the league with the trade deadline in the rearview mirror, here's a look at the 13 major deals that were made ranked in order by magnitude of how they could impact the 2025 season. 1. Colts acquire CB Sauce Gardner from JetsAcquired: GardnerTraded: 2026 first-round pick, 2027 first-round pick, WR Adonai MitchellThe Indianapolis Colts are all in on their 2025 squad that currently sits atop the AFC standings with a 7-2 record through the first nine weeks of the season. Running back Jonathan Taylor is the NFL's top rusher, and quarterback Daniel Jones is playing at a Pro Bowl-caliber level, which no one could have foreseen before the season kicked off. \nDefensively, Indianapolis needed help. They enter week 10 ranked 26th in pass defense (244.8 passing yards per game allowed), 29th in third down defense (45.7% third down conversion rate allowed) and dead last in passing yards per game allowed outside the numbers (152.2 passing yards per game allowed). Adding a 25-year-old All-Pro in Gardner should help shore up Indianapolis' greatest weakness. He hasn't allowed more than two catches to a single receiver in a game this season, and he's forced a tight window throw on 52% of his targets, the highest rate of any player targeted at least 20 times in coverage per Next Gen Stats, via NFL Research. \n        \n            \n                2025 NFL trade deadline winners and losers: Jets smartly stockpile for overhaul; Colts, Cowboys overpay?\n                \n                    Cody Benjamin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAs long as Jones proves his five-turnover performance at the Steelers in Week 9 was just one bad day and not him turning back into a pumpkin, the Colts are a legit contender now. 2. Cowboys acquire DT Quinnen Williams from JetsAcquired: WilliamsTraded: 2026 second-round pick, better of Cowboys and Packers 2027 first-round pick, DT Mazi SmithThe Dallas Cowboys have a top-five scoring offense (29.2 points per game, fourth-best in the NFL) and one of the top offensive nucleuses with quarterback Dak Prescott, running back Javonte Williams, wide receiver CeeDee Lamb, wide receiver George Pickens and tight end Jake Ferguson.\nHowever, the team is off to a 3-5-1 start with their Micah Parsons-less defense wasting that firepower by allowing the second-most points per game (30.8 points per game). They're also the second-worst third down defense (52.6% third down conversion rate allowed) in the last 50 years ahead of only the 1982 Kansas City Chiefs (52.8%). Dallas' was capable to sometimes elite across Parsons' four seasons with the Cowboys from 2021 to 2024, thanks to him helping the team generate a league-best 40.2% team quarterback pressure rate. That quarterback pressure can mask deficiencies in the secondary, and that's what the Cowboys are banking on All-Pro defensive tackle Quinnen Williams to help them do. His 40.0 career sacks are the third-most among 300-pound players since he entered the league as the third overall draft pick that year, and he's made the Pro Bowl the last three seasons. He can also help out against the run as his 13 runs stuffs for a loss or no gain are the second-most in the NFL this season, according to Next Gen Stats via NFL Research. 3. Bengals acquire QB Joe Flacco from BrownsAcquired: Flacco, 2026 sixth-round pickTraded: 2026 fifth-round pickNormally one could make the argument that a quarterback is the most impactful position on the field, so a team trading for one should be at the top of this list. However, the Cincinnati Bengals last-ranked scoring defense (33.3 points per game allowed) has mitigated Flacco's impact despite gaudy production.  \nHe threw for 470 yards passing four passing touchdowns and two interceptions in a narrow 47-42 loss against the Chicago Bears. That made him only the fifth player in NFL history to have a game with 40 or more points scored, 470 or more passing yards and 4 or more passing touchdowns in a game in a loss. Flacco leads the NFL in both passing yards (1,254) and passing touchdowns (11) since arriving in Cincinnati in Week 6, but the Bengals are 1-3 in that span.  4. Steelers acquire S Kyle Dugger from PatriotsAcquired: Dugger, 2026 seventh-round pickTraded: 2026 sixth-round pickThe Pittsburgh Steelers' fanbase brought out the pitchforks after consecutive defeats in which they allowed over 30 points to the Bengals (33) and the Green Bay Packers (35). Then, Pittsburgh traded longtime New England Patriots safety Kyler Dugger just ahead of the Steelers' Week 9 matchup with the top-seeded Indianapolis Colts, the NFL\"s No. 1 scoring offense (32.2 points per game). Coincidentally, the Steelers had their most disruptive defensive performance in 15 years, forcing six takeaways in a 27-20 victory. Those six takeaways are Pittsburgh's most since Hall of Fame Troy Polamalu's NFL Defensive Player of the Year season in 2010. They forced Colts quarterback Daniel Jones into five giveaways -- three interceptions and two lost fumbles -- after Jones had committed just three all year entering Week 9. With safety DeShon Elliott suffering a knee injury in Week 8 against the Green Bay Packers, Pittsburgh needed an impact player at safety. Dugger appears to be just that early on. \nSteelers defense, last 3 gamesWeeks 7-8Week 9 vs. INDPPG allowed 34.020Total YPG allowed462.0368Takeaways06Sacks255. Eagles acquire DE Jaelan Phillips from DolphinsAcquired: PhillipsTraded: 2026 third-round pickAfter being one of the most intimidating pass-rushing units in the NFL the last number of years, which resulted in two Super Bowl runs and a Super Bowl LIX victory, the Eagles needed help in that area. Their 16 team sacks are a bottom-10 figure, tied for seventh in the league, at the halfway point in the 2025 season. Recently retired edge rusher Za'Darius Smith's 1.5 sacks are the fourth-most on the team, and he last suited up for the Eagles in Week 6. Phillips should provide a major boost to one of the top NFC contenders. 6. Chargers acquire OL Trevor Penning from SaintsAcquired: PenningTraded: 2027 sixth-round pickThe Los Angeles Chargers are in the midst of another stereotypical, injury-plagued season in 2025. This year, their offense line absorbed the brunt of their injury woes this season with left tackle Rashawn Slater (patellar tendon) suffering a season-ending injury before the preseason and right tackle Joe Alt (ankle sprain) now out indefinitely. That's a key reason why Pro Bowl quarterback Justin Herbert is taking 8.9 quarterback hits per game this season, the third-most by a quarterback in the last 20 years. He's also taken an NFL-high 465 quarterback hits since entering the league in 2021. Los Angeles adding 2022 first-round pick offensive lineman Trevor Penning could be a major boost for Herbert and his health even though Penning hasn't been a world beater this season. Penning played right tackle his first few years in the league, but in 2024, his 7.6% quarterback pressure rate was the third-highest among 34 qualified right tackles last season. This year, he's moved to left guard, and Penning is performing slightly better: his 6.3% quarterback pressure rate is 22nd among 28 qualified left guards. Any help at all for Herbert up front will be much welcome for a 5-3 Chargers squad in the thick of a race for the AFC West crown in 2025. 7. Seahawks acquire WR Rashid Shaheed from SaintsAcquired: ShaheedTraded: 2026 fourth-round pick, 2026 fifth-round pickSeattle Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold is cooking with offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak, so Seattle's front office opted to add more fuel to that duo's collective fire. The Seahawks traded for New Orleans Saints wide receiver Rashid Shaheed to give Kubiak, who was the Saints OC in 2024, one of his favorite weapons back. Shaheed has 11 career touchdowns of 40 or more yards since 2022, the third-most in the league in that span behind only two All-Pros in Tyreek Hill (12) and Ja'Marr Chase (13).That verticality will pair well with Darnold, whose 9.6 yards per pass attempt this season lead the entire NFL. He threw for 330 yards, four touchdowns and an interception on 21 of 24 passing in a \"Sunday Night Football\" victory against the Washington Commanders in Week 9, and he was so dialed in he completed all of his 16 first-half passes for 282 yards and four touchdowns. Adding Shaheed to his arsenal along with 2025 NFL receiving yards leader Jaxon Smith-Njigba (948 yards receiving) and 2021 NFL Offensive Player of the Year wide receiver Cooper Kupp has Darnold positioned to keep the Seahawks well within the hunt for an NFC West crown. 8. Rams acquire CB Roger McCreary from TitansAcquired: McCreary, conditional 2026 sixth-round pickTraded: Conditional 2026 fifth-round pickOverall, the Los Angeles Rams pass defense has been strong, surrendering an opponent passer rating of 84.0, the sixth-lowest in the NFL this season. However, they would probably love to lower their passing yards per game total of 203.1, which ranks 13th in the league this season. The ex-second-round pick can line up inside or outside, making him a valuable piece of defensive coordinator Chris Shula's unit. 9. Jaguars acquire WR Jakobi Meyers from RaidersAcquired: MeyersTraded: 2026 fourth-round pick, 2026 sixth-round pickThe 2025 season just wasn't the Las Vegas Raiders' year with the team off to a 2-6 start under head coach Pete Carroll, and that's especially true for the connection between quarterback Geno Smith and wide receiver Jakobi Meyers. Smith threw four interceptions and no touchdowns while target Meyers this season, and Meyers had asked for a trade.Las Vegas granted his wish and sent him to the Jacksonville Jaguars where he can now contend for an AFC South title this season with quarterback Trevor Lawrence. The problem is Lawrence hasn't been good when throwing to his wide receivers this season, ranking 30th in both completion percentage (56%) and passer rating (73.0) when targeting them in 2025. 10. 49ers acquire DE Keion White from PatriotsAcquired: White, 2026 seventh-round pick Traded: 2026 sixth-round pickThe San Francisco 49ers are in the midst of the NFC playoff hunt despite all their injuries, which include a season-ending torn ACL for All-Pro edge rusher Nick Bosa. His absence has been significant: San Francisco ranks as the second-worst in the NFL in quarterback pressure rate (26.5%) since Week 4, their first game after Bosa tore his ACL. Additionally, San Francisco's 11 team sacks are tied for the third-fewest in the NFL this season. They can use all the help they can get from the former second-round pick. 11. Ravens acquire DE Dre'Mont Jones from TitansAcquired: JonesTraded: Conditional 2026 fifth-round pickThe Baltimore Ravens' playoff hopes have life after consecutive victories and the return to health of MVP quarterback Lamar Jackson. That's why they're looking to boost a pass rush that ranks tied for the second-fewest sacks (11) and the third-lowest quarterback pressure rate (27.3%) in the league. Jones could help since he's racked up 4.5 sacks across the last four weeks, but he's never been more than a rotational pass rusher who is now on his fourth NFL team. 12. Eagles acquire CB Jaire Alexander from RavensAcquired: Alexander, 2027, seventh-round pickTraded: 2026 sixth-round pickIn his prime with the Green Bay Packers, Jaire Alexander was once one of the top five cover cornerbacks in football. He's battled knee injuries the last few years, and then was a healthy scratch in his last few games with the Ravens. It's low-risk gamble by Eagles general manager Howie Roseman that Alexander could perform and be healthy while providing some support at the team's other outside cornerback position opposite Quinyon Mitchell. 13. Cowboys acquire LB Logan Wilson from BengalsAcquired: WilsonTraded: 2026 seventh-round pickLinebacker Logan Wilson goes from being benched on the NFL's worst scoring defense (33.3 points per game allowed) to now having a chance to play on the league's second-worst scoring defense (30.8 points per game allowed). Cowboys head coach Brian Schottenheimer said linebacker Kenneth Murray had one of his better games in Week 9 against the Arizona Cardinals, but the defense remained a mess. Wilson could be an upgrade for Murray and Jack Sanborn, but that's not saying much. \n            ",

Wins over Texas, Washington and Illinois is a nice trifecta through Week 10, and no opponent outside of the Longhorns in the opener has come within two touchdowns of Ohio State throughout the campaign. This team might be more complete than last season's squad that won the national championship.Wins over teams in projected CFP Top 25: 3\n    \n                                        \n    2. Alabama (7-1)The Crimson Tide hold the most ranked wins in college football (4), but we're not expecting Tennessee to be ranked in Tuesday's first playoff poll after its home loss to Oklahoma. Why is Alabama ahead of the SEC's only remaining unbeaten (Texas A&M) here? We're guessing the selection committee points to the Crimson Tide's strength of schedule, which is higher than the Aggies.\nWins over teams in projected CFP Top 25: 3\n    \n                                        \n    3. Indiana (9-0)Here's a team that rarely plays with their food -- and the selection committee has to like that. The Hoosiers' Big Ten wins at Iowa and that 53-point pasting of Illinois are also notable. Ranked No. 2 in game control, that's going to linger as a strength the rest of the way since Indiana's remaining three Big Ten opponents are a combined 0-16 in conference play this season. Wins over teams in projected CFP Top 25: 2\n    \n                                        \n    4. Texas A&M (8-0)Coming from behind to beat Notre Dame on the road along with the recent clobbering of LSU in Death Valley are high marks for the Aggies. We're not expecting LSU to be ranked in the selection committee's first poll, but it'll still count as a quality win away from home. The most likely SEC Championship Game scenario right now is Texas A&M vs. Alabama with both teams getting first-round byes if they win out in the regular season.Wins over teams in projected CFP Top 25: 1\n    \n                                        \n    5. Georgia (7-1)Unless Tennessee is ranked Tuesday night, Georgia's lone win over a top-25 team will be Ole Miss. The resume remains impressive since the victory over the Vols came inside Neyland Stadium, there was a road win at Auburn tossed in there and the Bulldogs' only loss came to one of the SEC's frontrunners. Georgia gets a chance to move into the top four if its takes care of business the next four weeks with victories over nationally ranked Texas and Georgia Tech.\nWins over teams in projected CFP Top 25: 1\n    \n                                        \n    6. Ole Miss (8-1)As it stands, the road triumph at Oklahoma last month is the Rebels' best win, but Ole Miss did take out LSU when the Tigers were unbeaten and ranked No. 4. With three games left against unranked competition, the best-case scenario is an 11-1 finish and first-round home game. The win over Tulane strengthens the Rebels' resume if the Green Wave beat Memphis this weekend.Wins over teams in projected CFP Top 25: 1\n    \n                                        \n    7. BYU (8-0)One of only four remaining unbeatens in the Power Four ranks, the Cougars' most important game in several years takes place Saturday at Texas Tech. That's a resume-boosting opportunity for both teams and should determine one-half of the entries in the conference title game next month. BYU's win over Utah on Oct. 18 is its best up to this point.Wins over teams in projected CFP Top 25: 1\n    \n                                        \n    8. Oregon (7-1)The Ducks have one win this season over a team with a winning record (at Northwestern) thanks to what was expected to be a signature victory at Penn State. For the most part, however, Oregon has squashed every opponent it has faced with the exception of the home loss to Indiana and the double-overtime victory in Happy Valley.\nWins over teams in projected CFP Top 25: 0\n    \n                                        \n    9. Texas Tech (8-1)Few teams have beaten Utah on the road during Kyle Whittingham's tenure, so that victory should impress the selection committee. Ranked No. 3 in game control this season, the Red Raiders have blistered much of the competition and their loss at Arizona State was impacted by starting quarterback Behren Morton being unavailable. Strength of schedule metrics won't help Texas Tech's case in the long run, but a win over BYU this weekend puts Joey McGuire's squad back in the Big 12's poll position.Wins over teams in projected CFP Top 25: 1\n    \n                                        \n    10. Texas (7-2)Steve Sarkisian and Arch Manning are getting hot at the right time. The most important win Texas currently owns is the head-to-head decision over Oklahoma in Red River. Should both of these teams finish with identical records, the committee would have to give the Longhorns the nod given the on-field result. Opportunities against top-5 Georgia and Texas A&M remain for a squad in great standing.Wins over teams in projected CFP Top 25:: 2\n    \n                                        \n    11. Miami (6-2)The last team in according to this projection if Tuesday night's rankings mirror our thoughts, Miami is the toughest team to grade in terms of where it will be placed this week. The Hurricanes are relying on early-season success to stake their claim as a contender considering what's transpired in recent weeks. Losses to Louisville and SMU should be critically-damaging, but we'll need to see how the committee views Miami's recent swoon before determining that.\nWins over teams in projected CFP Top 25: 2\n    \n                                        \n    12. Notre Dame (6-2)Notre Dame has three wins over teams with winning records -- Boise State, NC State and USC -- with more coming down the stretch vs. Navy and Pitt if all goes well for Marcus Freeman. We think that could be enough to leap a 10-win Miami team a few weeks from now considering that head-to-head loss to the Hurricanes came way back on Aug. 31. For now, though, it's hard to see the selection committee slotting the Fighting Irish over Miami given that result.Wins over teams in projected CFP Top 25: 1\n    \n                                        \n    13. Oklahoma (7-2)After beating Tennessee for their second win this season over a team we're projecting to be in the first CFP rankings, the Sooners would virtually guarantee a spot in the bracket by winning out against Alabama, Missouri and LSU.Wins over teams in projected CFP Top 25: 2\n    \n                                        \n    14. Georgia Tech (8-1)There's no metric out there that respects the Yellow Jackets following Saturday night's loss at NC State, their first of the season. With a strength of record grade at No. 16, Georgia Tech will behind Miami this week.\nWins over teams in projected CFP Top 25:: 0\n    \n                                        \n    15.

Virginia (8-1)The Cavaliers have won three overtime games and their only loss -- at NC State -- did not count as a conference game as they are the only team unbeaten in ACC play. Tony Elliott's team controls their own playoff destiny as a potential league champion.Wins over teams in projected CFP Top 25: 1\n    \n                                        \n    17. Louisville (7-1)Four points away from being unblemished, there are a few plays the Cardinals would like to have back during that overtime loss to Virginia. The win at Miami stands as one of the nation's best.\nWins over teams in projected CFP Top 25: 1\n    \n                                        \n    18.

USC (6-2)The selection committee will look at the Trojans' comeback win at Nebraska favorably since that came against a team with a winning record at full strength on the road. The head-to-head win over Michigan matters, too.Wins over teams in projected CFP Top 25: 1\n    \n                                        \n    20. Michigan (7-2)Winners of three straight since losing at USC, Michigan's chance to sway voters comes in the finale at Ohio State. That would be one of two wins over ranked opponents if the Wolverines finish 10-2, as long as Washington keeps it up.\nWins over teams in projected CFP Top 25: 1\n    \n                                        \n    21.

Memphis (8-1)As wacky as the American's been this season, the Tigers are the clear frontrunner heading into Friday's home bout with Tulane. In this spot, they would be the No. 12 seed as the auto-bid from the Group of Six.Wins over teams in projected CFP Top 25: 1\n    \n                                        \n    23. Illinois (6-3)Here's a team we'll be talking about this week, the only three-loss squad potentially being inside the top 25. Why? The Fighting Illini's strength of schedule ranks No. 6 and their setbacks have come against Ohio State, Indiana and Washington. Wins over Duke and USC were impressive.\nWins over teams in projected CFP Top 25: 1\n    \n                                        \n    24.

South Florida (6-2)Will the committee include the Bulls to ensure one of Miami's top wins this season stays put? Potentially. USF messed up its shot at controlling its own destiny a couple weeks ago at Memphis. If not USF here, Iowa (6-2) could be the choice.Wins over teams in projected CFP Top 25: 0\n            ",

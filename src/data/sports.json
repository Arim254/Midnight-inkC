His rights were traded to the New York Knicks in 2024. However, Nnaji never signed an NBA contract, and instead has been playing in Europe, most recently with Yukatel Merkezefendi in Turkey on loan from Spain's FC Barcelona. He averaged 7.5 and 4.0 rebounds with Yukatel Merkezefendi.Nnaji and Barcelona -- the team he had been with since 2020 -- mutually agreed to part ways after the 2024-25 season.Most recently, he played with the Knicks in the 2025 Summer League.\nNnaji was listed at 6-feet-11 and 226 pounds when he was drafted as an 18-year-old, and Givony lists him as 7-feet and 251 pounds with a 7-7 wingspan currently.\"There was serious steam for Nnaji to work his way into the back end of the first round, so Charlotte moving up to acquire him at No. 31 feels like decent value here,\" Kyle Boone wrote of Nnaji when he was drafted. \"Nnaji's measurables in terms of his size and length are impressive and he's a big leaper who can finish above the rim, though he does present as something of a project for the Hornets.\"\nInstead, in a wild twist, he'll end up playing college basketball more than two years after being drafted. Baylor is 9-2 this season and has been without Juslin Bodo Bodo (arm) and Maikcol Perez (ACL), two expected front-court contributors.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        After a heated argument between Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr and forward Draymond Green during the third quarter of Monday's game with the Orlando Magic, Green left the bench and headed for the locker room. On Wednesday, Kerr admitted that the situation was not his \"finest hour.\"Following the game, Kerr admitted that he and Green \"had it out a little bit.\" But claimed that the situation was private and that he wouldn't speak any more on the matter, though he changed his tune on Wednesday.  \"Monday night was not my finest hour, and that was a time I needed to be calm in the huddle,\" Kerr said after the Warriors' Wednesday practice. \"I regret my actions in that exchange. I apologized to [Green], he apologized to me. We both apologized to the team. \"These things, they happen -- especially when you get two incredibly competitive people like Dray and me. So, over the 12 years we've been together, this has happened occasionally, and I'm not proud of it.\"Green did return to the bench prior to the start of the fourth quarter, but did not re-enter the game, a contest that Golden State was leading 89-83 at the start of the final frame en route to a 120-97 victory.\nAs Kerr mentioned, he and Green have been together for 12 seasons, and while \"tempers spilled over,\" according to Green on Monday night, Kerr did not waver on his support for the veteran after the situation.\"There's a long history of that here because we understand each other, and I understand his power,\" Kerr said. \"There are four banners out there, and obviously a lot of people played important roles in that, but I've said this before, and I truly believe it: I don't think we have any without him. That's how much he impacts winning. So his ability to channel that passion, that emotion, that raw rage that he has is a key component to what makes us successful. And what I said about the other night, I didn't channel my own raw emotion and rage, of which there is plenty.  \"We are far more alike than anyone would ever realize. So yeah, this is not totally uncommon. I would say this hasn't happened in a few years, this kind of a divide and a blow-up, but in our 12 years together, it's not the first time. And we've always, always found a way to not only bounce back, but to make strides as a result.\"\nThe Warriors (15-15) have won two straight games to get back to .500 and will host this year's top draft pick Cooper Flagg and the Dallas Mavericks (12-19) on Christmas at 5 p.m. ET.\n            ",

He played through the injury in the team's next three games before missing three games to try to recover from the injury. In his first game back from that absence, he registered 12 catches for 127 yards and three touchdowns.Overall, Bowers finishes the season with 64 receptions for 780 yards and seven touchdowns -- all team highs, but the first two categories significantly down from a historic 112-catch, 1,194-yard debut season. Bowers' 112 receptions were a rookie record, and his 1,194 yards were a rookie tight end record.\nThe Raiders finish the season with games against the New York Giants and against the Kansas City Chiefs. The Week 17 matchup in New York is an important one, as both teams sport 2-13 records, tied for the worst in the NFL. The loser of that game will take over the top spot in the NFL Draft order.Rice, 25, appeared in just 11 games. After being suspended the first six games of the season, he returned and provided an immediate spark to the offense, accruing 53 catches for 571 yards and five touchdowns. However, he reported concussion symptoms after Week 15 and was inactive in Week 16. Now, with Kansas City's playoff hopes extinguished and Patrick Mahomes (ACL) done for the season, the Chiefs have shut down Rice as well.\nHere's a list of notable players whose seasons have come to an end due to an injury in the past few weeks.Dec. 24: Raiders TE Brock Bowers (knee)Dec. 24: Chiefs WR Rashee Rice (concussion)Dec. 24: Chiefs CB Trent McDuffie (knee)Dec. 24: Dallas Cowboys OT Tyler Guyton (ankle)Dec. 23: New York Jets QB Justin Fields (knee)Dec. 23: Cincinnati Browns RB Quinshon Judkins (leg/ankle)Dec. 20: Cowboys CB DaRon Bland (foot)Dec. 20: Giants EDGE Kayvon ThibodeauxDec. 19: Jets QB Garrett Wilson (knee)Dec. 19: Minnesota Vikings OT Christian DarrisawDec. 17: Green Bay Packers EDGE Micah Parsons (ACL)Dec. 17: Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes (ACL)Dec. 17: Vikings EDGE Jonathan Greenard (shoulder)Dec. 15: Washington Commanders QB Jayden Daniels (elbow)Dec. 13: Detroit Lions S Brian BranchDec. 13: Indianapolis Colts QB Daniel Jones (Achilles)Dec. 13: San Francisco 49ers WR Brandon Aiyuk (knee)Dec. 11: Cincinnati Bengals EDGE Trey Hendrickson (hip/pelvis)Dec. 1: Lions CB Terrion Arnold (shoulder)Nov. 26: Atlanta Falcons QB Michael Penix Jr. (ACL)\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Earlier this week, South Carolina's women's basketball team made a stunning announcement: French phenom Alicia Tournebize has signed with the school and will join the team after the holiday break. Tournebize, a 6-foot-7 center who has been playing professionally in France for Bourges Basket, will be eligible to play immediately. \"Alicia has an incredible skill set and basketball IQ,\" South Carolina coach Dawn Staley said in a press release. \"She has great touch around the rim, can shoot it out to the 3-point line and is a shot blocker. We're excited that she and her family chose to bring her game to Columbia, and the FAMS are going to enjoy what she adds to our team on the court and off.\"Ahead of South Carolina's return to action on Dec. 28 against Providence, let's take a closer look at this unique midseason acquisition. Who is Tournebize, and how could she help the Gamecocks' title hopes? The basicsPosition: CenterHeight: 6-feet-7Previous club: Bourges BasketCountry: FranceAge: 18Tournebize has been a name to watch among international prospects for a few years, but she really burst onto the scene this summer due to her breakout performance for France at the FIBA U18 Women's EuroBasket tournament. She averaged 12.1 points, 8.9 rebounds and 1.9 blocks on 54.9% shooting to help France win the bronze medal, and was named to the All-Star Five. \nDuring the bronze medal game against Belgium, she threw down a huge two-handed slam that went viral. \nTournebize has been playing professionally for Bourges Basket, who participate in La Boulangère Wonderligue (the top professional women's basketball league in France) and EuroLeague (a pan-European competition to crown the best team on the continent, akin to the Champions League in soccer). Due to her age and inexperience, Tournebize played sparingly for Bourges this season in both the LBW and EuroLeague. Her stats were almost identical in both competitions: 7.6 minutes, 2.9 points, 1.7 rebounds in the LBW and 7.3 minutes, 2.4 points and 1.9 rebounds in EuroLeague. \nWhy now?Player developmentWe don't have a specific answer from Tournebize, who was not quoted in South Carolina's press release, and only gave a brief quote in Bourges' press release that did not address her decision-making process. \"Bourges has helped me grow, both on and off the court. I am leaving today with everything I have learned here and with the desire to proudly represent the colors of my training club,\" Tournebize said, as translated into English. A statement from the club, again translated into English, does note that the move was made to \"prioritize the player's development. Here's Bourges' statement:\n\"This decision, which was carefully considered and reached through respectful dialogue, reflects the shared desire of both parties to prioritize the player's development while preserving the club's sporting integrity, in accordance with the mutual commitments set out in a settlement agreement.\"As previously mentioned, Tournebize was playing limited minutes for Bourges this season, and it's difficult for teenagers to earn more substantial roles overseas. At South Carolina, there's a clear pathway for Tournebize to become one of the Gamecocks' key players -- if not this season, then certainly in years to come. Staley is also one of the best coaches in all of basketball, and has a proven track record of developing bigs into top WNBA draft picks. Tournebize will have a chance to follow in the footsteps of A'ja Wilson, Aliyah Boston and Kamilla Cardoso. \nFamily historyIt's also worth noting that Tournebize's mother, French legend Isabelle Fijalkowski, came over to the States and played college basketball for Colorado before going on to the WNBA. Tournebize's mother would have been able to advise her on the benefits of playing college basketball. Potential payday?In terms of money, South Carolina's release stated that Tournebize was on a \"training-intern contract.\" It's unclear how much she was making for Bourges, but the nature of her status as a \"training-intern\" suggests it wasn't a lucrative deal. There are restrictions on international student athletes' ability to make money through NIL deals and direct payments from schools, but it is now possible, if complicated, for them to get paid. Depending on what South Carolina is able to work out, it is possible Tournebize could earn more in Columbia than she was in France. \nWhat does Tournebize bring to the Gamecocks?SizeTournebize's size is an obvious benefit. At 6-foot-7, she will immediately be the tallest player on the team, and one of the tallest players in the country. Per CBB Analytics, there are currently only six Division I women's basketball players standing 6-foot-7 or taller. Sania Feagin graduated and the Gamecocks are missing both Ashlyn Watkins (away from basketball) and Chloe Kitts (torn ACL) this season, which has decimated their frontcourt depth. Madina Okot and Joyce Edwards are the only players above 6-foot-1 who play significant minutes. Due to injuries, the Gamecocks have often had only eight available players, and simply having another player who can contribute will be a big boost. (South Carolina's 17.5 bench points per game ranks 198th in the country.) That Tournebize will help their frontcourt depth is even better for Staley. \nTournebize is slim, and may struggle at times to deal with more physical players in the paint. A full offseason with South Carolina will help change that moving forward, though. AthleticismTournebize moves very well for her size, and can get up and down the floor. She's also agile with good footwork and lateral mobility, which helps her in halfcourt situations on both sides of the ball. And, of course, there aren't many players throwing down dunks like she did this summer for France. Paint presenceTournebize's size makes her a real presence in the paint on both sides of the ball. At U18 EuroBasket this summer, she scored efficiently around the basket, and was fourth in rebounds and fourth in blocks for the tournament. Again, she needs to become stronger, but her height and length will help her make an immediate impact. \nMid-range gameTournebize rarely steps behind the arc, but she is comfortable in the mid-range, where she has a smooth jumper. For a team that takes 62.4% of its field goal attempts in the paint, having a big who can provide any kind of spacing is going to be helpful. \nTournebize is only 18 years old, and will be adjusting to a new country, a new coaching staff, new teammates and a new league. She's not going to step on the floor and immediately start dominating, and she may not even play that much, especially initially. However, Staley wouldn't have brought her over midseason if she didn't think she could help, and adding a player as talented as Tournebize is a real boost for the Gamecocks. Other title contenders are not making this sort of addition ahead of the new year. The 12-1 Gamecocks, who lost in the national championship game last season, are ranked No. 3 in the country and are one of the main contenders looking to knock UConn off its throne.  \nHow does this affect Tournebize's WNBA Draft prospects?One of the more interesting aspects of this move is that it actually delays Tournebize's WNBA draft eligibility. Under the current rules -- which could be subject to change in the new collective bargaining agreement -- international prospects must turn 20 in the year in which the draft takes place, while domestic prospects must turn 22 in the the year in which the draft takes place. Once Tournebize begins playing in the NCAA, that will make her a domestic prospect. \nIf Tournebize had stayed overseas, she would have been eligible for the 2027 WNBA Draft. Now, barring any changes to the rules, she'll have to wait for the 2029 WNBA Draft. Has this ever happened before?While Tournebize is the most high-profile example, she is not the first international player to sign with a school during the middle of the season. Auburn added Chinese guard Yuting Deng in January just last season (Deng has since transferred and now plays for Baylor), and Egyptian center Jana El Alfy joined UConn in January of 2023, though she did not play with the team until the following season. Furthermore, two Australian prospects, center Callie Hinder (Arizona) and forward Zoe Jackson (Indiana) will join their respective schools this January, though both plan to redshirt and will not play this season. There are also examples of this happening on the men's side of college basketball. Israeli center Yonatan Levy joined UW-Green Bay in January last season (he has since transferred to Pepperdine) and Russian big man Kirill Elatontsev will suit up for Oklahoma starting in January. \n            ",

    "body": "\nSportsLine NFL expert Jeff Hochman successfully nailed both of his Week 16 betting system picks, taking the Bengals against the Dolphins and the Raiders against the Texans when looking at teams who bounce back after being shut out in a loss. Hochman has shifted his focus to Week 17 and has identified a play under his system which looks at division games featuring low totals.NFL divisional underdogs in games with totals of 42 or lessWin Rate: 84-57-4 ATS (59.5%)Sample Size: Since 2013Criteria: Any divisional underdog in a game with a total of 42 or lessEdge: November and December outdoor gamesWhy does this work?There's something about Week 17 when division rivals meet. These teams know each other inside out, so games are scrappy and points are hard to come by. Oddsmakers aren't fooled— they set the totals low, figuring defense and weather will do their part. And the underdog? They get a few more points than usual, just because it's such a familiar battle. If you're paying attention, there's an edge to be found.Week 17 qualifiersCleveland Browns +3.5 vs. Pittsburgh Steelers | Confidence: 5 out of 5\nThe Browns feel like a good pick to cover +3.5 against the Steelers. If Pittsburgh already has the AFC North title wrapped up, you can bet the Steelers will sit their main guys. For Cleveland, this game is everything—the Browns will be fired up, especially with Myles Garrett chasing the sack record. Playing at home gives them a little extra juice, too. Even if the Steelers are the more talented team, the Browns have plenty of reasons to show up big.When Mike Tomlin was directly asked about resting starters if the division is clinched, he stated: \"It's possible.\" For a 42-year-old Aaron Rodgers nursing a left wrist injury, combined with the Steelers' extensive injury list (T.J. Watt out, Seumalo out, Pierre out, Herbig questionable), a rest scenario becomes operationally sensible. The Steelers currently hold the No. 4 seed—clinching before their contest means there's no seeding benefit to winning in Cleveland, only an increased injury risk before the playoffs.The Browns are out of the playoff hunt, sitting on the No. 3 overall pick with about a 25% shot at landing the top spot. While the 2026 draft isn't packed with quarterback talent, the 2027 class looks far more promising. But don't expect Cleveland to roll over just to boost its draft odds—especially not with the Steelers on the other side. These teams have a real rivalry, and pride always matters in this matchup. This asymmetry means the Browns may effectively be the more motivated team on the field—an unusual dynamic in a contest where Pittsburgh is 9-6 and Cleveland is 3-12.\nPittsburgh just lost its top receiver for the next two games—850 yards and 6 touchdowns out the window because of a suspension. Losing DK Metcalf really stings. He was targeted 99 times this season and was the Steelers' go-to guy for making things happen downfield. That leaves Pittsburgh counting on Adam Thielen, who's 34 and not exactly a picture of health, and Calvin Austin III, who's banged up and might not even play. Without Metcalf, it's a tall order for Rodgers—he's already throwing for just 6.9 yards per attempt (NFL average is 7.0), and his QBR (44.3) is well below average (50.0). With their best deep threat out, the Steelers could really struggle to keep drives alive or hit those big, momentum-shifting plays.This matchup really favors the Browns' pass rush going up against a shaky Steelers offensive line. Keep in mind, Pittsburgh is just 3-9 straight up when T.J. Watt is out. On top of that, the weather looks windy (15-25 mph), which could make throwing the ball tricky. Most of the public is loading up on the Steelers—73% of spread bets and 75% of the cash, per DraftKings. Take the points where you can, and don't shy away from sprinkling a little on the Browns' money line.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        FRISCO, Texas — Players all around the NFL found out they made the Pro Bowl for the 2025 season on Tuesday, and the Dallas Cowboys ended up with five amid a 6-8-1, postseason-less year.Quarterback Dak Prescott, wide receiver George Pickens, left guard Tyler Smith, defensive tackle Quinnen Williams and kicker Brandon Aubrey were the five to earn the individual All-Star accolades for the Cowboys. Given how the year has gone on the field, Prescott wasn't in a celebratory mood when discussing the honor despite producing like a top-five quarterback a year removed from a season-ending hamstring injury in 2024.\"It's cool. It's something good within the season. Understanding every year I work my tail off to try to be the best quarterback I can for this team. Ultimately, I feel like I'm judged off of wins. I didn't get it done this season. However, the individual numbers, performance record, allowed an individual accolade, but that's 100% still a team deal,\" Prescott said Tuesday. \"When you're the quarterback of this team, to be able to put up numbers like that, you've got to have receivers like George, CeeDee, Ferg, the rest of the guys. And you've got to have a great offensive line. ... My success, that accolade, is 100% with each and every one of those guys in there. It's pretty cool to be a Pro Bowler, but at the end of the day, it's not what we're going for.\"\nDak PrescottNFL rankCompletion percentage 68.5%5thPassing yards4,1752ndPassing TD283rdExpected points added (EPA)/dropback0.177thPassing first downs2022ndDallas owner and general manager Jerry Jones took accountability for the Cowboys' 30-year Super Bowl drought after the team's Week 16 defeat against the Chargers on Sunday. A year like 2025 has everyone from top to bottom in Dallas looking in the mirror.\"I'll admit that the Cowboys management has played a big role (in the 30-year Super Bowl drought),\" Jones said postgame. \"But seriously, I'm very disappointed that the way we're structured, and my role, puts us here tonight. I'm tremendously disappointed.\"The 2025 season marks just the third of Prescott's 10-year career in which he will have played at least 12 games and missed the playoffs, along with 2017 and 2019. He'll be 33 years old at the start of the 2026 season, and he knows he's on the back nine of his NFL career. That's why Prescott plans to seek more input with Jones and the Cowboys' front office when it comes to communicating exactly what he feels the team needs to thrive going forward.\"We won't be back here in this spot. I feel like the last few times I've probably said that were playoff losses, right? So each year has its own troubles. ... I'm going to do my damnedest just controlling what I can, and you know as you get older, having more input, having more say-so and being asked more questions from the front office, maybe there's a little bit more that I can do. It's not just physically or me getting better at my game. Maybe it's speaking up and saying that, 'This will help, or I think this can help.' So, whatever it takes, I'm going to do my damnedest and make sure that I'm influencing and encouraging everybody else around me -- not just players -- to do the same.\"  Here's a look at three moves Prescott could influence once Dallas enters the offseason in two weeks.Re-signing WR George Pickens\nNew Cowboys wide receiver George Pickens broke out in his first year in Dallas at age 24, playing like a top-five player at his position while catching passes from Prescott. The Dallas duo has connected for 13 plays of 25 or more yards this season, tied for the third most in the NFL, and now they'll head to the Pro Bowl together.\"Super explosive,\" Pickens said of the connection he built in Year 1 with Prescott. \"I feel like that's one of the biggest things when you look back on the year, even though it's not over. Just look at the explosive plays that me, him, CeeDee [Lamb], Flo [Ryan Flournoy], everybody produced on offense. Javonte [Williams], too.\"Pickens' career year came at the perfect time, with the 2022 second-round pick set to become a free agent next offseason upon the expiration of his rookie deal.\"It improves my career, but as far as contractually, I can just wait until the offseason,\" Pickens said of making the Pro Bowl. \"Trying to finish up this season on a positive note.\" George PickensNFL rankCatches888thReceiving Yards1,3423rdReceiving TD97thReceiving First Downs693rdCatches of 25 yards or more  13T-3rdPickens would like to remain in Dallas, so Prescott will certainly look to make sure Jones knows he wants his co-No. 1 receiver back with the Cowboys for the foreseeable future. The success Pickens experienced in 2025 has enticed him to want to make Dallas his long-term home.\"Definitely, like I always said, the guys here, I feel like you can't get that everywhere,\" Pickens said. \"I kind of have been at other places -- top 30 visits when I was coming out in the pre-draft -- the guys here and the culture here are just a little different.\"Re-signing RB Javonte Williams\nDallas made 25-year-old running back Javonte Williams its first free agent signing in 2025, inking him to a one-year, $3 million deal in March. They got him at that price because he hadn't quite looked the same since a gruesome knee injury that resulted in multiple torn ligaments in 2022 with the Broncos. However, he fully bounced back from the effects of that injury to produce like a top-10 running back. Williams is certainly someone everyone involved with Dallas' offense would like to have around again in 2026.\"He certainly earned the right to be the bell cow here,\" coach Brian Schottenheimer said Wednesday. \"We like him in that role.\"Williams said last week that he's found a \"very special\" fit in Dallas. That's a fit Prescott would certainly like to remain going forward, given Williams is one of three players -- along with Tony Dorsett (1977) and Ezekiel Elliott (2016) -- to produce 1,000 yards and 10 rushing touchdowns in their first season with the Cowboys.\"You don't always want to just follow money and things like that,\" Williams said. \"You want to go somewhere where you can succeed and be a part of something that's special. I feel like it's very special here.\"Javonte WilliamsNFL rankCarries2397thRush yards1,1476thRush TD10T-7thRush first downs63T-4thKeeping Tyler Smith at left guard\nWith 2024 first-round left tackle Tyler Guyton sidelined with an ankle injury since Week 13, Dallas has had All-Pro left guard Tyler Smith protecting Prescott's blind side for the team's final three games of 2025. It's an arrangement the Cowboys are experimenting with to see if they may want to keep Smith in that role in the future, even though they made him the NFL's highest-paid interior offensive lineman this offseason with a four-year, $96 million contract extension.Guyton did play right tackle at Oklahoma, and current Cowboys right tackle Terence Steele leads the NFL in quarterback pressures allowed (42) this season, according to TruMedia. Dallas could save as much as $14 million if it designates Steele as a post-June 1 release. It is also worth noting Smith was a college left tackle at Tulsa.\n\"If you watch the way [Smith] played and how these guys functioned, we know he can play out there. We're not surprised. I'm not surprised,\" Schottenheimer said Monday. \"At the end of the day, we made the move because we thought it gave us the best chance to win the next three games. That's the way it's going to be for these next two games now. We'll evaluate everything. It's no different from scheme. We'll evaluate everything.\"Smith earned the third Pro Bowl selection of his four-year career in 2025, as he was Pro Football Focus' sixth-highest-graded run-blocking guard with a 79.8 grade. He's all for being a team player, but he'd appreciate continuing to play the position that made him a second-team All-Pro in 2023 and a Pro Bowler again in 2025.\"Bro, I'm an All-Pro guard, bro. You feel me? That's the simple truth that we're just looking at stuff, purely off facts,\" Smith said Tuesday. \"So we'll see what happens. We'll have those conversations. Got to see where everybody's head is at.\"  At 6-foot-6 and 332 pounds with 34-inch arms, Smith feels his best position is guard. That's something Prescott may need to help Smith relay to Schottenheimer and Jones this offseason.\n\"I'm a strong guy obviously. I think I'm strong. I feel like a lot of the strengths that I have as a player are very good for me at the guard position,\" Smith said. \"I think I've had great vets around at the guard [Zack Martin] and tackle position [Tyron Smith], and I think that's really helped me be successful at both. But I really just think my strength and a variety of other things help me when I'm inside.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NBA's Christmas Day tradition continues this year with a five-game slate featuring some of the best teams and players in the league, including the reigning champion Oklahoma City Thunder and reigning MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander trying to avenge some recent losses against the up-and-coming San Antonio Spurs, led by Victor Wembanyama. Donovan Mitchell, Jalen Brunson, Karl-Anthony Towns, De'Aaron Fox, Jalen Williams, Stephen Curry, Anthony Davis, Cooper Flagg, LeBron James, Luka Dončić, Kevin Durant, Nikola Jokić and Anthony Edwards are some of the other stars who will be in action throughout the day. The action will tip off with a Madison Square Garden matinee featuring the New York Knicks and Cleveland Cavaliers, and conclude with a Mile High matchup between the Minnesota Timberwolves and Denver Nuggets. Before you settle in for 12 hours of hoops, let's take a closer look at the slate with an X-factor to keep an eye on and a bold prediction for each game. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Cleveland Cavaliers at New York KnicksTime: 12 p.m. ETWatch: ABC/ESPN/fubo (Try for free) Odds: Knicks -6 | O/U: 238.5 (via FanDuel)X-factor: Jaylon TysonTyson didn't play much as a rookie, but he's quietly become an important piece for the Cavs this season. He's averaging 13 points, 5.4 rebounds and two assists on 52.4/45/78.4 shooting splits in 19 starts. He's fourth on the team in minutes and has been their best 3-point shooter thus far. \nDuring this chaotic season in Cleveland, Tyson has been one of the few constants. He's also been unafraid to speak his mind, and called out the team earlier in the season for a lack of effort. \"We're not hungry enough,\" Tyson said after their loss to the Celtics on Nov. 30. \"I feel like teams want it more than us, there's a target on a lot of our guys' backs, and it's everyone's job to say, 'you wanna come at us, let's go.'\"Tyson and the Cavaliers will have a chance to respond on Christmas. Bold prediction: The Cavaliers will winIt's crazy that this qualifies as a bold prediction, but the Cavaliers have been the most disappointing team in the league. After winning 64 games last season, they're just 17-14 and stuck in seventh place in the Eastern Conference. While they've had major injury issues, poor health doesn't explain everything that's gone on in Cleveland this season. This remains one of the most talented rosters in the league, and the Cavs are only two games back of the No. 3 seed in the crowded middle of the pack in the East. Their Christmas showdown with the Knicks is the perfect opportunity to snap out of their funk, pick up a signature win and start climbing back up the standings. They'll enter the game off the back of consecutive victories (albeit against the Charlotte Hornets and New Orleans Pelicans) where they put up 139 and 141 points, respectively, which should give them a real confidence boost. \n\n        \n            \n                Can the Cavaliers -- the NBA's most expensive team -- snap out of their funk?\n                \n                    John Gonzalez                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    San Antonio Spurs at Oklahoma City ThunderTime: 2:30 p.m. ETWatch: ABC/ESPN/fubo (Try for free)  Odds: Thunder -9.5 | O/U: 233.5X-factor: Luke KornetThe Spurs gave Kornet a four-year deal in free agency to steal him away from the Boston Celtics and shore up their frontcourt situation behind Victor Wembanyama. That was hailed as a smart move in the offseason, and looks even better now. Kornet slid into the starting lineup while Wembanyama was out with a calf injury, and has remained in that role as the Spurs work the French phenom back slowly. Kornet is averaging career-highs of 8.2 points, 6.7 rebounds, two assists and 1.4 blocks per game, while shooting 63.5% from the field. He doesn't put up huge numbers, but he's always in the right spot and making smart, connective plays. Somehow, he also seems to be good for one highlight reel play each night. In the Spurs' win over the Thunder on Tuesday, he threw down an alley-oop over Chet Holmgren. \nBold prediction: There will be multiple technical foulsFamiliarity breeds contempt, as the saying goes, and this will be the third matchup between these teams in the last two weeks. The first two have been competitive, physical affairs won by the up-and-coming Spurs. There's also some real animosity between Wembanyama and Chet Holmgren. \nThe Thunder are going to be back at home on national TV looking for revenge and to snap their first skid (2-3 in their last five games) of the season. It would not be a surprise to see some emotions boil over on Christmas. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Dallas Mavericks at Golden State WarriorsTime: 5 p.m. ETWatch: ABC/ESPN/fubo (Try for free)  Odds: Warriors -8 | O/U: 227.5X-factor: Ryan NembhardRyan Nembhard, the younger brother of Pacers point guard Andrew Nembhard, went undrafted this year despite leading the NCAA in assists last season.

He's averaging 10.9 points and seven assists on 51.5 shooting, including 48.6% from 3-point range as a starter, and is coming off an 11-point, seven-assist effort in the Mavericks' victory over the Thunder, during which he played all but eight seconds of the fourth quarter. \nBold prediction: Stephen Curry scores 40 pointsIt's unbelievable that Curry is still carrying such a burden for the Warriors and scoring so efficiently while doing so. In NBA history only four other players -- Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Kobe Bryant and Alex English -- have averaged at least 20 shots per game after turning 35. None of them have been as efficient as Curry, who is shooting 39.8% on 12.3 3-point attempts per game, and boasts a 64.2% true shooting percentage.Curry has always had the ultimate green light, but this season, in particular, he can do whatever he wants. Jimmy Butler doesn't seem super interested in shooting, Brandin Podziemski is their third-leading scorer at 12.4 points per game and Draymond Green has more turnovers (75) than made baskets (72). Curry already has four 40-point games this season, and a showcase game on Christmas against the No. 1 pick is a perfect time to add another one. He's certainly going to take enough shots to get there. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Houston Rockets at Los Angeles LakersTime: 8 p.m. ETWatch: ABC/ESPN/fubo (Try for free)  Odds: Rockets -3.5 | O/U: 229.5X-factor: Reed SheppardAfter a strong start to the season, the Rockets have lost four of their last five games to fall to 17-10 and sixth place in the Western Conference. Their lone win during that skid came against the Nuggets when Reed Sheppard hit a career-high six 3-pointers en route to 28 points, his second-highest scoring game of the season. \nSheppard, the No. 3 pick in last year's draft, barely played as a rookie, but has been thrust into a big role this season due to Fred VanVleet's injury. Boasting extreme confidence in his shot, Sheppard has been lighting it up from behind the arc. He's making 43.5% of his 6.3 3-point attempts per game, and leads the Rockets with 73 makes from long distance. In fact, he's made nearly a quarter of their 3s on the season. The Rockets are dead last in 3-point attempts per game (30.2), and are perhaps overly reliant on Sheppard to provide an outside threat that opponents have to respect. Despite some inconsistent production from the second-year man, Houston has a 121.9 offensive rating with Sheppard on the floor and a 115.7 offensive rating when he sits. The Rockets are 5-2 when Sheppard scores more than 15 points and 12-8 when he does not. If they want to beat the high-powered Lakers, they may need a big night from Sheppard. \nBold prediction: This is the last time LeBron plays on ChristmasNo one has played on Christmas Day more often than LeBron James, who is making his 20th appearance on the holiday. Earlier this month, he made it clear that he's had enough of the occasion. \"I'd much rather be at home with my family,\" James said earlier this week. \"But I mean, it's the game, it's the game I love. It's the game I watched when I was a kid on Christmas Day, watching a lot of the greatest play the game on Christmas. It's always been an honor to play it. Obviously, I'm gonna be completely honest, I would like to be home on the couch with my family all throughout the day. But my number is called -- our number is called, so we have to go out and perform and I look forward to it.\"James has not announced any retirement plans, but given his age (he'll turn 41 next week), growing injury issues due to sciatica and these comments, it's fair to wonder if this is the last time we'll see him suit up on Christmas. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Minnesota Timberwolves at Denver NuggetsTime: 10:30 p.m. ETWatch: ABC/ESPN/fubo (Try for free)  Spread: Nuggets -4 | O/U: 238.5X-factor: Tim Hardaway Jr. Hardaway was one of the Nuggets' many veteran additions during the offseason, and has been a perfect fit alongside Nikola Jokić. He's shooting a career-high 41.7% from 3-point range on six attempts per game, is the team's leading scorer off the bench and has appeared in every game this season. Hardaway has been a constant source of production for the Nuggets while Aaron Gordon and Christian Braun have been sidelined, and has helped the team maintain a 21-8 record, which is good for third place in the Western Conference. If they want to get back on track and take down the Timberwolves after a narrow loss to the Mavericks on Tuesday, they'll need another strong showing from Hardaway, who has had at least 20 points and six 3s in each of his last two games. Bold prediction: Anthony Edwards is going to put someone on a posterEdwards said earlier this month that he doesn't consider himself a superstar. \"I don't think it's no pressure. I don't think I'm under a spotlight. I don't really think I'm a superstar,\" Edwards said. \"I think to some people I may be. But to myself, I'm really not. So I don't really put no pressure on myself. They got other guys in the league for that.\"\nHowever he categorizes himself, he's one of the game's best players and thrives under the bright lights. He'll be eager to put on a show on Christmas, especially against another Western Conference contender. Don't be surprised if he tries to put someone on a poster in the process. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Just two weeks are left in the 2025 NFL regular season, but there's still plenty left to be sorted out with the impact of each remaining game seemingly rising by the week. Fourteen teams are eliminated from playoff contention, and just two playoff spots in each conference are still up for grabs. However, seven of the NFL's eight division titles have yet to be claimed. Here's how the AFC standings have shaken out with just two weeks left to play: Denver Broncos (12-3, lead AFC West, clinched playoff berth)New England Patriots (12-3, lead AFC East, clinched playoff berth)Jacksonville Jaguars (11-4, lead AFC South, clinched playoff berth)Pittsburgh Steelers (9-6, lead AFC North)Los Angeles Chargers (11-4, clinched playoff berth)Buffalo Bills (11-4, clinched playoff berth)Houston Texans (10-5)Indianapolis Colts (8-7)Baltimore Ravens (7-8)Here's how the NFC standings stack up with the defending Super Bowl LIX champion Philadelphia Eagles being the first team in 2025 to clinch a division title. Both the Carolina Panthers and Tampa Bay Buccaneers can only reach the postseason as the NFC South champion, and the Detroit Lions can only make the playoffs as the No. 7 seed. Seattle Seahawks (12-3, lead NFC West, clinched playoff berth)Chicago Bears (11-4, lead NFC North, clinched playoff berth)  Philadelphia Eagles (10-5, clinched NFC East)Carolina Panthers (8-7, lead NFC South)San Francisco 49ers (11-4, clinched playoff berth)Los Angeles Rams (11-4, clinched playoff berth)Green Bay Packers (9-5-1)Detroit Lions (8-7)Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-8)With so many permutations remaining, here is a look at some of the most impactful games of the Week 17 slate as they relate to the postseason, plus a battle for the 2026 NFL Draft's first overall pick.\n        \n            \n                NFL facing possible nightmare playoff scenario in Week 17 that could kill the drama in final week of season\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThursday (Christmas Day)Lions (8-7) at Vikings (7-8)The Detroit Lions enter Week 17 with just a 5.1% chance to reach the postseason, according to CBS' SportsLine model because they need a lot to go their way. They need to win out at the Minnesota Vikings on Christmas and then knock off the NFC North-leading Bears in Chicago in Week 18. Even if they win out, they also need the Green Bay Packers to lose in Week 17 when they host the Baltimore Ravens and in Week 18 at the Minnesota Vikings. That's their only path back to the postseason. \nGetting swept by the Packers and losing five of their last eight games since returning from their bye week in Week 9 has put the Lions in a precarious position. Good news for Detroit is Minnesota will be starting backup quarterback Max Brosmer in place of the injured J.J. McCarthy, who suffered a hand injury in Week 16. Brosmer threw four interceptions in a 26-0 loss at the Seattle Seahawks back in Week 13. Broncos (12-3) at Chiefs (6-9)The Denver Broncos can clinch the AFC West division this week with a win, plus a Los Angeles Chargers defeat against the Houston Texans. Denver will be blessed with the opportunity to face Chiefs third-string quarterback Chris Oladokun, a 2022 seventh-round pick of the Pittsburgh Steelers who spent the last four seasons on Kansas City's practice squad, in his first career start. SaturdayTexans (10-5) at Chargers (11-4)The Houston Texans can return to the playoffs for the third year in a row by simply beating the Los Angeles Chargers at SoFi Stadium or by the Indianapolis Colts losing against the AFC South-leading Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday. An AFC West title is still on the table for the Chargers, who can knock off the Broncos in Week 18 by winning against the Texans on Saturday before facing Denver in their final regular-season game. \nThis game features two of the hottest teams in the league with Houston earning victories in 10 of its last 12 games and Los Angeles winning seven of its last eight games. This game will come down to which offense can prevail against either the NFL's No. 1 scoring defense (the Texans, who are allowing 16.6 points per game) or the NFL's No. 8 scoring defense (the Chargers, who are allowing 20.1 points per game). Ravens (7-8) at Packers (9-5-1)The Baltimore Ravens have a tightrope-like path to the postseason: they can win the AFC North if they beat the Packers and Steelers, while the Steelers lose to the Cleveland Browns in Week 17. Meanwhile, the Green Bay Packers are sitting pretty, by comparison, just needing to win one more game or have the Detroit Lions lose one more game.Saturday night at Lambeau Field will be interesting because both squads have uncertainty about their quarterback situation. Both Lamar Jackson (back) and Jordan Love (concussion) exited their respective team's Week 16 game with injuries. Jackson didn't practice on Tuesday while both Love and his backup Malik Willis (right shoulder) practiced as limited participants. \nSundaySteelers (9-6) at Browns (3-12)The Pittsburgh Steelers can win the AFC North by beating the Cleveland Browns on Sunday, plain and simple. This matchup could lose some of its impact before kickoff because the Steelers can also clinch the division title if the Packers do former quarterback Aaron Rodgers a solid by beating the Ravens on Saturday night.Browns All-Pro edge rusher Myles Garrett can also clinch the NFL's all-time, single-season sacks record with his 23rd sack of 2025 against Rodgers on Sunday afternoon. Seahawks (12-3) at Panthers (8-7)The Carolina Panthers can clinch the NFC South title with a win over the No. 1 seed Seattle Seahawks, and a Tampa Bay Buccaneers loss against the Miami Dolphins. Carolina did already beat the then-No. 1 seed Los Angeles Rams earlier this season. The Seahawks' path to the NFC West crown and the conference's No. 1 overall seed is simple: win out against the Panthers and then against the San Francisco 49ers in Week 18. Plenty on the line in this Sam Darnold revenge game. \nJaguars (11-4) at Colts (8-7)The Jacksonville Jaguars have a somewhat plausible path to being the AFC's No. 1 seed: winning out against the Indianapolis Colts in Week 17 and the Tennessee Titans in Week 18 and both the Denver Broncos and New England Patriots losing just one of their remaining two games. Jacksonville can lock up the AFC South this week with a win and a Texans loss against the Chargers on Saturday night. The Colts, who have a 1.8% chance of making the playoffs per CBS' SportsLine model, need to win out against the Jaguars and Houston Texans and have the Texans lose against the Chargers in Week 17. Giants (2-13) at Raiders (2-13)The New York Giants and the Las Vegas Raiders currently possess the first and second overall picks in the 2026 NFL Draft, respectively. CBS' SportsLine model gives the Giants a 32.6% chance at securing the top pick and the Raiders a 27.6% shot at the first overall pick. \nThis matchup will also be historic: it's the first game in NFL history between teams both entering a matchup on nine-game losing streaks. The Tank Bowl is here, and it is glorious. Patriots (12-3) at Jets (3-12)The New England Patriots can win the AFC East in Week 17 with a victory over the New York Jets and a Buffalo Bills loss against the reigning Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles. Both outcomes are quite plausible. The No. 1 seed in the AFC is also well within reach for the Patriots should they win out against the Jets and Miami Dolphins and the Denver Broncos lose against either the Chiefs in Week 17 or the Chargers in Week 18. Meanwhile, the Jets are in possession of the 2026 NFL Draft's fourth overall pick with a chance to climb higher up the board with two more losses to finish out the season. The top pick in the 2026 NFL Draft is still within reach. \nEagles (10-5) at Bills (11-4)The Philadelphia Eagles are fighting for playoff seeding only, having already won the NFC East, but the highest they can climb is likely the No. 2 seed. The Buffalo Bills need to win out and have the Patriots lose one more game in order to win the AFC East for a sixth year in a row. A battle between two preseason Super Bowl favorites will be quite the treat.Bears (11-4) at 49ers (11-4)Both the Chicago Bears and the San Francisco 49ers have the top seed in the NFC in their sights. The Bears have an 11% chance, according to CBS' SportsLine model, to pull it off with a win at the 49ers on \"Sunday Night Football\" in Week 17  before closing out the regular season at home against the Detroit Lions with another victory along with the Seattle Seahawks losing a game. The 49ers possess a 25% chance, according to CBS' SportsLine model, to finish atop the NFC with a Week 17 win against the Bears before concluding the regular season with a win against the Seattle Seahawks. If the 49ers can grab the No. 1 seed, they won't have to leave Levi's Stadium again starting in Week 17 since the site of Super Bowl LX is their home in Santa Clara. No game is more impactful in Week 17 than \"Sunday Night Football.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Things at the top of the NBA Draft Big Board are relatively stable from a month ago, but that may not last long. Questions about the durability (and availibilty) of Kansas' Darryn Peterson, coupled with the ascension of BYU's AJ Dybantsa and the exceptional play of Duke's Cameron Boozer have narrowed the gap for the No. 1  overall pick as we head into conference play.While those top three remain in a class among themselves, UNC power forward Caleb Wilson's consistency, athleticism, rebounding and versatile defensive tools are closing the gap. Meanwhile, Tennessee's Nate Ament has had some bumps in the road recently in the Volunteers' jumbo lineups, but is still the type of combo-forward that usually pans any well long-term in the association.Who's top point guard?There's also an interesting battle behind Peterson at the point guard position. Louisville's Mikel Brown is the most skilled of the bunch, while Houston's Kingston Flemings is the most explosive. Scouts are worried about Brown's durability and defense and still have questions about the sustainability of Flemings shooting. Arkansas' Darius Acuff meanwhile isn't the most explosive or skilled, but he very well may be the best college player.Flemings, who moved from No. 15 to No. 7 this month, isn't the only high-level athlete to make a jump. A month ago, it seemed almost aggressive to have Baylor's Cameron Carr on the fringe of the first round. That was until I got the chance to watch him live in Las Vegas at the Players Era and then it became clear that was way too low. With Carr's combination of length, athleticism, shot-making, and scoring, he's now played his way to the fringe of the lottery, even if he does have to keep building up his body.\n\n        \n            \n                2026 NBA Draft: 10 observations from a loaded Players Era event in Las Vegas\n                \n                    Adam Finkelstein                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWashington's Steinbach moves upThe most notable riser in the frontcourt is Washington's Hannes Steinbach. The freshman from Germany has real size and strength with great hands and a soft touch. He's a high-volume rebounder and showing some flashes of being able to stretch the floor. Steinbach's understanding of the nuances of ball-screen play is also exemplary. The way the NBA is now trending back towards bigger frontlines is also relevant, since he fits better in that better then he does four around one schemes.\nNew to the Big BoardThis iteration of the big board also includes some new names. Texas Tech's Christian Anderson and Duke's Patrick Ngongba are both making their debut, and making it in first-round territory. Questions about Anderson's size will linger, but his skill and productivity are undeniable. For Ngongba, the lack of lateral quickness will remain a concern, but the shot-blocking and floor-spacing is intriguing enough to compensate when he's healthy. Other notable newcomers include Iowa State's Joshua Jefferson (30), Wake Forest's Juke Harris (40), and Alabama's Amari Allen (44).\nBig Board Top 101Darryn PetersonKansasPG6-6205Fr2AJ DybantsaBYUSF6-9215Fr3Cameron BoozerDukePF6-9250Fr4Caleb WilsonNorth CarolinaPF6-10215Fr5Mikel BrownLouisvillePG6-4190Fr6Nate AmentTennesseePF6-10207Fr7Kingston FlemingsHoustonPG6-4190Fr8Jayden QuaintanceKentuckyC6-10255So9Koa PeatArizonaPF6-8235Fr10Thomas HaughFloridaSF6-9215JrThe Big Board has been updated to include the top 60 NBA Draft Prospects\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Something serious is happening in San Antonio, where the Spurs handed the Thunder a 130-110 loss on Tuesday to move into sole possession of the Western Conference's No. 2 seed at 22-7. The Spurs have now given OKC half of its four losses this season, both coming over the last 10 days. The Thunder, who lost just once through their first 25 games, have actually lost three of their last five, with the other defeat coming at the hands of the Timberwolves, who have very quietly won 10 of their last 12. If you truly want to believe OKC is beatable, this is your time as the ease of their early schedule turns upside down. Zooming out, the consensus remains that the top of the Western Conference belongs to the Thunder, Nuggets and Rockets. The Lakers are a wild card. The Timberwolves are trying to knock on the door. But at the moment, the Spurs are the team that is threatening to kick the damn thing down, if they haven't already. Would it be easier to slap the \"few years away\" tag on the Spurs? Sure. Give them time, everyone would like to say. Think long term. Let the supporting cast develop. Hell, let Victor Wembanyama develop. The guy is barely old enough to drink legally.\nBut what if this is really happening right now? Take an honest look at this team and find a reason why they can't beat anyone in a seven-game series that doesn't include \"they're just not ready.\" Do they not have a superstar? Do they not have a second offensive star? Are they not deep enough? Not versatile enough? Do they not have the sixth-best shooting percentage (including a top-10 3-point percentage) in the league? Do they not have multiple ball handlers and playmakers? Do they not have a top-five offense and defense? OK, you got me. They're sixth in defense. Seriously, what non-narrative, strictly basketball argument can you make that Spurs aren't an elite team? If you've got one, I'd love to hear it. Until then, let's talk about why this bright future everyone likes to put off in the distance has actually already arrived. Wemby changes everythingWe know how much Victor Wembanyama changes a basketball game, and yet I'm not sure we are ready to fully accept how much that changes a postseason outlook that we still want to believe is about experience over all else. A lot of people said the same thing about the Warriors in 2015. The masses just weren't ready to see what Stephen Curry was doing and how much it was changing everything we knew about the game. \nIndeed, Wembanyama warps defensive space in the same way Curry does offensive space. The range from which he can destroy your offense is a geometric anomaly. Jump shooters have to change their entire calculus when he's closing out. Drivers require multiple extra steps of separation to avoid erasure, and they're still looking over their shoulder. Wemby doesn't just blocks shots (incidentally, his streak of 101 straight games with at least one block ended on Tuesday); he scares you into not even taking them. To say this changes everything is an understatement, and it's also to say nothing about Wemby's own offensive dominance, where he shatters everything you thought you knew about spacing and potential ground coverage. Giannis has given us a taste of this, but not before Wembanyama did you ever have consider the possibility that a guy might take a roll pass from the top of the circle and easily get home without taking a single dribble. Since his return from a month-long calf-strain absence, Wembanyama has been coming off the bench and has only played 20 minutes per game, and still he averaged 17.8 points, 9.2 rebounds and two blocks on 56% shooting over his first six games back (this includes the NBA Cup championship that doesn't technically count toward stats). \nThere isn't a single other player in the league who has met these statistical bars this season, and this guy has come back from a month off to do it in 20 minutes a night off the bench. Per 36 minutes (roughly what he played in seven November games), Wembanyama has averaged 31 points, 16 rebounds, 5 assists and 3.5 blocks on 56% shooting, including 42% from 3, in his five official December games. All told, he's the only player in the league averaging at least 23 points, 10 rebounds, three assists and three blocks, and he's clearing those numbers comfortably. He is truly matchup proof. Put a big man on him and he's making him look foolish with his handle and array of shot making (ask Anthony Davis, one of the better big man defenders in the world, who tasted the full seasoning of Wemby's 40-piece cooking in the season opener). Put a small defender on him (as has been a frequent strategy), and he's rising up for jumpers with an shot-contest imperviousness that makes Kevin Durant jealous. On top of it all, the guy might be one of the league few truly competitive psychopaths. Victor Wembanyama is a monster. We know this. What we didn't know, or at least what we weren't so sure about, was just how good the rest of the Spurs were going to be. \nAn elite support staffPrior to the season, you didn't have to be a basketball savant to look at the Spurs' roster and point to a lot of really good players outside of Wemby, but when they went 9-3 while Wembanyama was out with a major win over the Nuggets, it was a real eye-opener. This team is a lot more than just Wembanyama. Stephon Castle is making 60% of his 2-pointers and looks like a Jimmy Butler in the making. When he and Wemby have been on the court together, San Antonio has outscored opponents by more than 14 points per 100 possessions with what would rank as the No. 1 defense in the league, per Cleaning the Glass. De'Aaron Fox averaged 25.5 points and 6.8 assists on 48/40/83 shooting splits in the month Wemby was out. He is the second star you need in a postseason series where every opponent is going to do everything in its power to limit Wembanyama. Devin Vassell is having one of the best seasons you've likely heard nothing about. There are two kinds of good shooters in basketball: Those who look to shoot, and those who can't wait to shoot. Vassell can't wait. He hunts shots like prime Klay Thompson. He's shooting 40% from 3 on seven attempts a night and has the league's 13th-highest \"Win probability added\" number, both overall and in the Clutch, via Inpredictable. Harrison Barnes leads the league with 35 corner 3s and is shooting 40% from beyond the arc overall. He is a perfect 3-and-D role player until you start thinking that's all he can do, at which point he overpowers you with back-to-the-basket force, show-and-go drives and crafty interior footwork. Luke Kornet is what Isaiah Hartenstein is to the Thunder: The No 2 big who is actually a No. 1. Scorers are shooting over four percentage points worse when defended by Kornet -- a number right in line with Anthony Davis -- and when Kornet has been with the starters in place of Wembanyama the Spurs have won those minutes by over 11 points per 100 possessions, per CTG.Keldon Johnson should be in Sixth Man of the Year conversations. He is pure energy and has been incredible getting downhill as a powerful paint scorer. His 57% mid-range clip is top 10 among wings. His 132.7 points per 100 shot attempts ranks in the 93rd percentile, per CTG. He went for 25 on five 3-pointers in the Tuesday win over OKC.  Dylan Harper is going to be an absolute stud when he starts to shoot and score more efficiently, but in the meantime he's already a major impact player as basically a third point guard. The No. 2 overall pick can get two feet in the paint whenever he wants. He's strong. Forceful. Over San Antonio's last two NBA Cup elimination games he combined for 45 points on 8-of-12 3-point shooting, then he turned around and was one of the best players on the floor against OKC with only four points, tallying 10 assists and five steals with zero turnovers in 20 minutes. All of this speaks to a level of versatility that makes San Antonio a scary postseason threat. It would be one thing if Wembanyama had to play superman at 21 years old over night, but he doesn't (even if he's sort of a superhero just in his natural state). That would burn out. But the Spurs can beat you a bunch of ways with a bunch of different catalysts. Consider that on Tuesday night the Spurs got 12 points from Wemby, six points from Fox, four points from Harper, and beat the best team in the world by 20 points. Over their last eight games, they have had seven different leading scorers. Eight guys are averaging double-digit points. Nine are playing at least 20 minutes a night. \nJeremy Sochan might be their best perimeter defender and is barely a rotation player because the Spurs don't have to forfeit offense for defense, or vice versa. Everyone they put on the floor can do everything. In a postseason setting, to have three primary ball handlers, all of whom share that duty when they share the floor, and at least four premium individual shot creators is a luxury very few teams enjoy. The Spurs can play small. They can do the two-big thing -- with Wembanyama and Kornet on the court they are outscoring opponents by 7.8 points per 100 possessions with an basically impenetrable 100.9 defensive rating, per CTG. Again, I defy anyone to find me a reason that the Spurs shouldn't be considered a legitimate threat to beat any team in the world in a seven-game series. That's not to suggest they will win the whole thing, or hell, even get out of the first round. The Western Conference is a bloodbath. It's just to say they're just as capable as any non-OKC team and, well, they've beaten OKC twice with a chance to do it again on Christmas. \nThe Spurs are, right now, one of the five best teams in the league without a question, and if you're a top five team, you are, by any definition, ready. The fact that they're going to be even better in the years to come is another, even scarier story. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 Major League Baseball offseason is ongoing, and with the Winter Meetings drifting farther behind us we're working our way deeper into the sport's offseason calendar. Among other things, the winter in baseball means a steady supply of rumors regarding free agent signings, trades, and the like. Speaking of which, you can find Wednesday's Christmas Eve roundup just below. Yankees among teams interested in HaysVeteran outfielder Austin Hays is seeing his free agent market pick up. \nThe Yankees are among the teams with some level of interest in Hays, the New York Post reports. However, the Yankees would likely pursue Hays only if fellow outfielder Cody Bellinger, a core member of the Yankees last season and one of their top offseason targets, signs elsewhere. Hays has previously been reported to be of interest to the Mets and Royals. \nHays, 30, has a career OPS+ of 106 across parts of eight MLB seasons. Last season, he had an OPS+ of 105 for the Reds. He has a career WAR of 10.8, and in 2023 he earned his first and to date only All-Star selection as a member of the Orioles. For his career, Hays boasts an OPS of .819 against left-handed pitching. Marlins sign FairbanksThe Marlins have agreed to terms on a one-year, $13 million free agent contract with veteran reliever Pete Fairbanks, the Athletic reports. \nThe 32-year-old Fairbanks has served as the Rays' closer for the last three seasons, and earlier in the offseason CBS Sports ranked him as the No. 40 free agent in the 2025-26 class. Here's part of RJ Anderson's write-up: \n\"Fairbanks was a late addition to the free-agent class when the Rays surprisingly declined his club option. He's always struggled with durability (this past season marked his first time clearing 50 innings in a year) and his strikeout rate is a shadow of its old self. That said, Fairbanks continues to possess a nasty slider and he should slot into a high-leverage role for someone.\"The Marlins were in need of high-leverage relief help, especially after Ronny Henriquez was lost to Tommy John surgery. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Welcome back to the Court Report, Matt Norlander's in-season college basketball notebook feature that provides insider information and a deeper look at the trends and things to know around the sport. Consider this edition a bonus present under your proverbial college hoops tree, especially amid a light week for games. Merry Christmas! The further we get into this spectacular season, the more I'm convinced the quality at the top of men's college basketball is deeper and more impressive than any season in the past decade, if not more.It's easy to get that impression when you see Michigan routinely dismantling teams by 30, if not 40 points; or Iowa State handing a robust Purdue team the program's worst home loss ever; or Arizona becoming the only squad in history to win five of its first nine games against ranked competition; or Duke and BYU combining to go 23-2 behind the phenoms who might be the top two picks in the 2026 NBA Draft. There's Gonzaga's return to supremacy with its 12-1 run out of the gate, an introduction matched by UConn's restoration to elite-level play with its own 12-1 start. North Carolina is also 12-1 heading into 2026, putting on its best nonconference showing since the 2008-09 team won the national title -- and doing so with Caleb Wilson, its best freshman since Cole Anthony. \nHouston? Very much good enough to win it all after falling one shot short in April. Speaking of teams making recent Final Fours, Purdue getting back for the second time in three years wouldn't shock anyone who's paying attention. Also in the Big Ten: Michigan State sits at 11-1 and has one of the three best point guards in college basketball, Jeremy Fears. Vanderbilt and Nebraska -- Vanderbilt! And Nebraska! -- are undefeated and look headed toward special campaigns as well.\n        \n            \n                Norlander's Court Report: Fred Hoiberg's Huskers the feel-good story of season; Boozer-Yax NPOY race heats up\n                \n                    Matt Norlander                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThere's been a conspicuous lack of upsets, but the exchange for that is a run on high-end teams that might give us the most competitive season in recent history. As Christmas arrives, there are six undefeated groups and 21 more one-loss teams still on the books. In addition to the attractiveness of so much winning from so many interesting teams over the past seven weeks, there's data to back up the idea that we're in the midst of an unusually strong season at the top of college basketball.  \nAs of Christmas, seven teams boast an adjusted efficiency margin of 30.00 or better at KenPom.com (with two more, Vanderbilt and Illinois, clearing the 29.00 threshold). And while intra-conference play promises to shave off some of the sweetness on some of these teams over the next 10 weeks, there's still a realistic chance that 2025-26 will yield the strongest group of national title contenders since at least 2014-15. That's when Kentucky made it to the Final Four with an undefeated record and the Wisconsin team that upset Kentucky fell to Duke in the NCAA title game. Those three teams in addition to 33-3 Villanova, 34-4 Arizona and 30-4 Virginia all wound up above +30.00 in adjusted efficiency margin. Kentucky's undefeated push into April overshadowed the fact that all six were viable national title contenders.This season looks primed to produce even more. For reference, here's how many teams finished above +30.00 in adjusted efficiency margin at KenPom since '14-15. 2014-15: 62015-16: 12016-17: 12017-18: 12018-19: 52019-20: 12020-21: 22021-22: 12022-23: 02023-24: 32024-25: 62025-26: 7 as of Christmas; TBD by AprilLast season was the mighty SEC's doing as much as anything, and you can make the case that this year is merely competing with what we saw a season ago in terms of might at the top ... until you realize this season is outpacing 2024-25's impressive output. \nOn Christmas Day in 2024, the top 10 teams in the AP poll weren't winning as much or by more on average than this season's cream of the crop. Right now, the collective record for the AP's top 10 teams -- Arizona, Michigan, Iowa State, UConn, Purdue, Duke, Gonzaga, Houston, Michigan State and BYU -- is 113-7. A year ago at this time the AP's top 10 were 105-13, a win percentage difference of .53 points. And a year ago on Christmas there were four teams at +30.00 in efficiency margin, not seven, and only five at +29.00 or better instead of the nine we've got as of today. Going all the way back to the start of this century, here's how the top 10 teams in the AP poll aggregated in wins and losses after seven full weeks/at the start of Week 8 in each of their respective seasons. This year has provided the fourth-most wins to this point in the calendar by the top 10 AP teams since 2000-01.\n                                                                    CBS Sports research\n                                                            Losses are sure to come in sporadic doses for the top teams, but every indication to this point is that we can and will have more than just two or three \"great\" groups. A common and lazy lament in many recent seasons by some pundits was to suggest college basketball lacked any great teams; now we seem to have been gifted a bevy of them.\nI have more good news: Beyond the strength at the top, college basketball also has a chance to have its best offensive season ever. The sport's 365 schools are combining to average 78.1 points per game, a number that will naturally drop over the next three months. Conference play leads to fewer possessions and tighter whistles, which will bring down scoring. (Happens every season.) Still, the scoring record is in sight, as is efficiency. Teams are pacing to score more points per possession this season than ever before. It's been a dream start so far. I think — I hope! — the patterns persist through January, February and into March.As we ready for league play, I think the list of schools that can win a national championship — teams truly capable of winning six games in the Big Dance, a massive ask — fills up to 12, an abnormally high number for this time of year. That figure could whittle by four or five come March, and it easily could see three or four candidates not on my list now vault into the discussion before long. But heading into 2026, my dozen-deep ranking of title contenders reads: Michigan, Arizona, Iowa State, UConn, Purdue, Duke, Houston, Gonzaga, Michigan State, Illinois, BYU and North Carolina. \nThose 12 are a combined 132-11. A remarkable group. You'll notice there's not an SEC team in there. At least not yet. I'm just as surprised as you are. So let's talk about that next.  After epic '24-25, the SEC has taken big step backThe SEC falls behind the Big 12, Big Ten and ACC in wins vs. ranked competition this season. \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            The SEC's collective 2024-25 season was so impressive, it almost definitely cannot be matched in the decades to come. The league sent 14 of its 16 teams to the NCAA Tournament, in addition to having two No. 1 seeds; it put seven teams in the Sweet 16; saw its two 1-seeds (Auburn, Florida) make the Final Four; and Florida won the national championship. That kind of run is almost impossible to duplicate. And the grandiosity of it all is what's making this season's SEC look so down in comparison.\nMissouri's humiliating no-show loss Monday night to Illinois (91-48, the largest margin in the history of that rivalry) in the annual Braggin' Rights game was the league's 50th nonconference defeat through the first 49 days of the season. Last season, the SEC lost 23 non-con games TOTAL — including all postseason play — leading to a staggering 185-23 record and an .889 win percentage. We will never see a league-wide success rate like that again. This season, the SEC has a .742 win percentage (144-50 overall) and its impotency against ranked teams and fellow high-major schools is worrying evidence against the league's chances of getting more than eight or nine into the field come March. A year ago, the SEC finished with 73 wins against high-major opponents. This year, the SEC's record vs. the other four Power Five leagues sits at 35-47. When you filter through for games vs. AP Top 25 teams at the times of those games, the SEC is in fifth in win percentage. Here's how the high-majors stack up vs. ranked opponents:\n» Big 12: 13-13 (.500)» ACC: 10-19 (.345)» Big Ten: 13-26 (.333)» Big East: 5-13 (.278)» SEC: 9-26 (.257)In Quad 1 games, the SEC is an ugly 15-36, even falling behind the ACC's 16-31 mark through Christmas week. Undefeated Vanderbilt is the only team above .500 against Q1 competition (3-0). And as for 12-0 Vandy, it has to be rated as the best SEC squad so far. But the Commodores haven't been given top-10 respect yet because they're yet to defeat a top-30 team. At KenPom, their non-con SOS is 86th. Far from awful, but also far from the high end of toughest schedules in the sport. The irony of the SEC clearly going through league-wide regression is KenPom nevertheless still (narrowly) rating the league No. 1. Here's why: Predictive models have preseason biases still having some (but not that much) influence seven weeks into the season. We call those \"priors,\" and in a month, they'll be phased out. When you filter the results purely based on win expectancy at Torvik, the SEC comes in at No. 3, slightly ahead of the ACC, thanks to not having any outright terrible teams.\nThe biggest knock on the league right now is, unlike the other four power conferences, I don't know who is a true national title contender at this stage. A year ago, you could've made a case for five or six. Now ... pick one? Vanderbilt, Florida, Arkansas, Alabama, Kentucky -- would you take any of them right now to win at least four games in the NCAA Tournament, let alone six? I'm fascinated to see how this league plays out over the next nine weeks. I do think at least one SEC team emerges as a legitimate national title contender by the end of January. Dybantsa's dynamite December spikes his NPOY caseA week ago, right here at the Court Report, I laid out the compelling case Michigan's Yaxel Lendeborg was building to compete with Duke's Cam Boozer for national player of the year. Well, AJ Dybantsa wasn't going to lurk on the outskirts any longer. The BYU stud freshman is now also officially in the mix after an outstanding December that ended in exclamation-point fashion Monday night (BYU's next game is Jan. 3 at Kansas State). Dybantsa became the first freshman this century to post a triple double with at least 30 points after he finished with 33 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists and a pair of steals against lowly Eastern Washington, which 1-11 vs. D-I teams.  Even despite the awful competition, Dybantsa's performance was fitting after he vaulted himself to non-negotiable First Team All-American status over the past six games. BYU general manager Justin Young tweeted Dybantsa's December stats, which are the best of any player in the sport this month. Dybantsa's averages in the past six games: 27.8 points, 8.0 rebounds, 5.7 assists, 2.3 steals, 65.9 FG%, 78.0 FT%, 2.5 turnovers, 29.4 3-pt% and just one foul in 193 minutes (!!) on the floor. \nAccording to Opta Stats, Dybantsa is \"the only Division I or NBA player in the last 30 seasons to have a calendar month\" with a minimum of five games played to average at least 25.0 points, 5.0 rebounds and shooting 65.0% or better from the field, all while not losing a game. Dybantsa is turning into the most dangerous scorer in college basketball. \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            His talent and potential were obvious more than two years ago, when he was a rising junior who led the EYBL in scoring. He is delivering — exceeding, actually — on the hype. I caught Dybantsa in person earlier this month after BYU set a program record by overcoming a 22-point halftime deficit to beat Clemson at MSG. That was his official coming-out party for college basketball. Now he's positioning himself to jockey with Boozer, Lendeborg and anyone else (Joshua Jefferson, Caleb Wilson, Braden Smith, JT Toppin) that wants to join the party for NPOY. The one stat that's not yet getting enough attention, but will if it remains true by mid-January, is Boozer (23.3 ppg) and Dybantsa (23.1) are now 1-2 in scoring. Yes, nationally. That's a great development for the marketability of college basketball, especially since both players are vying for No. 1 overall pick status on teams capable of winning the national title.  I can't get enough of this season and the megawatt star power it's providing.   Norlander's news + nuggets  • Wrote above on Dybantsa, but another player who had a huge December for a national title contender was Gonzaga's Braden Huff. In five games, including three vs. power-conference teams, he averaged 24.4 points and 5.4 rebounds on absurd shooting splits: 53-of-74 (71.6%). He dropped a career-high 37 against Campbell on Dec. 17. If Huff is going to move into 15-plus points every night no matter what, then he and Graham Ike will be the best big man duo in college hoops.  • Best non-Gonzaga team outside the power-conference structure heading into January is Utah State. The Aggies are 10-1 and fall between 18th and 31st in every NCAA teamsheet metric. The 100-58 bludgeoning of a solid Colorado State team last weekend was a signal that this group is good enough to push for a legitimate seed (the 4-6 range) in March.   • Another mid-major to watch for that's quietly getting it done is Tulsa. Eric Konkol's group finished non-con at 12-1, its lone loss by one point at Kansas State. This is the best team in the American, and a big year is overdue; Tulsa hasn't won an NCAA Tournament game since 2003.  • Did you know: Not only are Iowa State, Vanderbilt and Nebraska flawless in men's hoops so far, but they're the only three schools with undefeated records in both men's and women's hoops. The four programs are a combined 73-0. I do wonder if this is the first time we've ever had three schools in men's and women's hoops all make it to Christmas without losing a game. • A tragic story over the weekend: Austin Peay canceled its game against UMKC after the team bus driver died during pre-game meal. The Govs will now go 20 days between games against a Division I opponent, the longest gap of the season -- and the longest since the 2020-21 COVID-impacted season. • Bill Self says out loud what most presumed was the case: Darryn Peterson's family is dictating when he'll return again. I know KU fans are growing tired of the waiting game, but my guess is he plays for the Jayhawks in their next game (Jan. 3 Big 12 opener at UCF). • On Monday, the Kansas City Chiefs announced approved plans for their new covered football stadium, with the debut set for 2031. I hate how the NFL is trying to make open-air stadiums outdated concepts. There is a college basketball angle to this, though: I can almost guarantee you that we'll have a Final Four at this stadium no later than 2035. • Speaking of new sports arenas, North Carolina is still not sure where its basketball teams will play in the 2030s and beyond. There is a debate over whether to refurbish the Dean Dome or build a shiny new arena that would be off-campus. More than 100 former players have signed a letter that, among other things, states, \"We further wish to honor Dean Smith's request that our cherished basketball brand and legacy always remain on campus.\" • I grew up reading Andy Katz's work at ESPN.com and I love that he's tapping back into that spirit more and more by writing for Seth Davis' HoopsHQ site. Here's his latest, on Indiana State coach Matthew Graves' return to coaching after having triple bypass heart surgery in October.• I was on hand in Jersey on Saturday to see Houston humble Arkansas, and my biggest regret on this Christmas Eve is not knowing only a few days ago that the commercial below existed. A friend texted me this on Tuesday; I only wish that I could have asked Kelvin Sampson and John Calipari about it. The two have coached more than 2,200 games, but only twice against each other. Yet, in 1995, they were highlighted in a commercial for Degree deodorant. I need this commercial recreated in 2026 with Sampson and Calipari, for sure, but let's also toss in Dan Hurley, Scott Drew and, why not, Sean Miller. \n            ",

Kyle Tucker, Alex Bregman, Bo Bichette, Framber Valdez, Cody Bellinger and Ranger Suárez are among the players still on the free agent market, which has been slow to develop. Kyle Schwarber (who returned to the Phillies), Pete Alonso and Edwin Dìaz (who both left the Mets for the Orioles and Dodgers, respectively) all signed during the Winter Meetings in December.Earlier this winter, right-hander Dylan Cease agreed to a seven-year, $210 million deal with the Blue Jays on Thanksgiving Eve. It's tied for the fourth-largest deal in terms of total money among active pitchers, and is a big boost for the reigning AL champs. While there's no Aaron Judge or Juan Soto on the market this winter, there's plenty of top talent still available. Tucker, a four-time All-Star who will turn 29 in January, leads the list, and though his second half left much to be desired, he could be a huge asset for any team. Bregman was left on the market until late last winter but he showed no ill effects, putting up a 128 OPS+. On the pitching side, Valdez and Suárez would slot in toward the front of any rotation.\n\n        \n            \n                Ranking top 50 MLB free agents for 2026: Kyle Tucker, Alex Bregman at top, plus landing spots for every player\n                \n                    R.J.

    "body": "\nIt went rotten.After a sizzling Week 15, my picks weren't so good in Week 16. That's usually what happens when you start thinking you are good making these picks.It always seems to even out. Good, bad, good, bad, good, bad.So that means it's time for some good this week.I went 7-8-1 against the spread and 8-8 straight up last week. That brings my ATS record to 124-114-2 and the straight-up record to 159-80-1. With two weeks left, it's time to get back on track -- even if this is a tough week because of quarterback injuries and motivational factors. It's almost as challenging as Week 1 when there are so many unknowns. But here we go.All Week 17 NFL betting lines via DraftKings Sportsbook.Dallas Cowboys (-7) at Washington CommandersThursday, 1 p.m. ET on Netflix\nThis looked like it might be a big Christmas Day game before the season, but it's not close to being one. Both teams are eliminated and the Commanders don't have their starting quarterback or likely their backup in Marcus Mariota. It could be Josh Johnson. Look for Dallas and Dak Prescott to go in and light up the Washington defense. Cowboys win it.  Pick: Cowboys 31, Commanders 23Detroit Lions at Minnesota Vikings (+7.5)Thursday, 4:30 p.m. ET on Netflix\nThe Lions need this game to have any playoff chance, but it won't be easy on the road. Minnesota has played outstanding defense. The problem is the Vikings have rookie Max Brosmer playing for the injured J.J. McCarthy. That could be an issue, even against a Lions defense that has struggled.   Pick: Lions 21, Vikings 19Denver Broncos at Kansas City Chiefs (+13.5)Thursday, 8:15 p.m. ET on Amazon Prime\nThe Broncos are coming off a bad loss to the Jaguars, so their focus will be good here. The Chiefs are done and hardly look like the team we've come to know the past eight years. Chris Oladokun  will start at quarterback against a good Denver defense. Good luck with that. The Broncos will rebound, but pride might keep the Chiefs in it for a bit. Pick: Broncos 24, Chiefs 13Houston Texans at Los Angeles Chargers (-2.5)Saturday, 4:30 p.m. ET on NFLN (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThis is an enormous game for both teams in terms of playoffs. Both are riding winning streaks, but the Chargers have looked better in theirs. The Texans' defensive front can cause problems for Justin Herbert, but they were better in protection last week against the Cowboys. Look for the Chargers defense to win this one against a Texans offense that struggled against the Raiders. Pick: Chargers 22, Texans 16Baltimore Ravens at Green Bay Packers (-3)Saturday, 8 p.m. ET on Peacock\nThe Packers might not need this game if the Lions lose on Thursday. That's a good thing since Jordan Love is in the concussion protocol. Lamar Jackson could also miss this game for the Ravens with a bad back. The Ravens have to have this one or they are done. This is tough to pick, with the QB injuries, so I will go with the home team. Pick: Packers 24, Ravens 20Arizona Cardinals at Cincinnati Bengals (-7)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThis is a game featuring two of the disappointments of the season. But Joe Burrow can still light up a defense like he did last week against Miami and the Cardinals on the road in the cold just seems like a formula for misery. Their defense is miserable too. Burrow will put up a big number as the Bengals roll.  Pick: Bengals 38, Cardinals 19Jacksonville Jaguars (-6.5) at Indianapolis ColtsSunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Colts have slim playoff hopes, while the Jaguars are trying to win the division. Motivation goes to the Jaguars. The Colts have a ton of major injuries and the defense is a mess. The Jacksonville offense is rolling and Trevor Lawrence will continue that here. Pick: Jaguars 35, Colts 20New England Patriots (-13.5) at New York JetsSunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Jets have been awful the past two weeks and wouldn't seem like much of a threat here. But the Patriots are coming off a big victory against the Ravens and might not be as focused. OK, forget it. This is going to be an easy ride for the Patriots. Blowout city. Pick: Patriots 36, Jets 9New Orleans Saints (-2.5) at Tennessee TitansSunday, 1 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThe Saints have come alive with Tyler Shough at quarterback, while the Titans are coming off a victory over the Chiefs. They played much better in that game. But I think the Saints have consistently played better and Shough will continue to play well here. Saints win it.  Pick: Saints 27, Titans 17Pittsburgh Steelers (-3) at Cleveland BrownsSunday, 1 p.m. ET CBS (Stream on Paramount+) \nThe Steelers might not need this game if the Ravens lose to the Packers on Saturday night. But even so, they seem to be getting things righted, so they probably want that momentum to carry over. The defense has improved in a big way in recent games and that should show up against a bad Browns offense. Pick: Steelers 23, Browns 13Seattle Seahawks (-7) at Carolina PanthersSunday, 1 p.m. ET CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThis is a long trip for the Seahawks in their quest to win the NFC West, but they played last Thursday, which helps with the rest. Look for the defense to play well here and limit Bryce Young and the Panthers offense. Sam Darnold will play better than he did against the Rams as the Seahawks win it.  Pick: Seahawks 24, Panthers 16Tampa Bay Buccaneers (-5.5) at Miami DolphinsSunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Bucs have to win the next two to win the division. Miami is done and the past two weeks has played like it. This is a road game for Tampa Bay, but will it feel like it? Look for Tampa Bay to win it behind a better showing from Baker Mayfield and the offense. Pick: Buccaneers 28, Dolphins 21New York Giants at Las Vegas Raiders (-1.5)Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThis is the \"No. 1 Pick Bowl\" with the loser actually winning. The loser will go into the final week as the team with the first-overall pick. That would be a good thing. As for the game, the Raiders showed better last week and I think that carries over. They win an ugly one against a Giants team that struggles on offense.   Pick: Raiders 21, Giants 17Philadelphia Eagles at Buffalo Bills (-1.5)Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThis is a big game in terms of playoff push, but both teams have locked up playoff berths. The Eagles are playing for seeding, while the Bills are just hoping to win two and hope the Pats lose to have a chance to win the division. This could be a game that gets a little loose, with the Bills winning it late with a field goal in the final seconds.Pick: Bills 33, Eagles 31Chicago Bears at San Francisco 49ers (-3)Sunday, 8:20 p.m. ET on NBC\nThis is a huge game in terms of the NFC playoff race. The 49ers are coming off a Monday night victory, but being at home helps that short week. The Bears are rested, having played on Saturday. But the 49ers offense is cooking right now and I think Brock Purdy will get the best of the Chicago defense.Pick: 49ers 32, Bears 27Los Angeles Rams (-8) at Atlanta FalconsMonday, 8:15 p.m. ET on ESPN/ABC (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Rams are still playing for the division title, while the Falcons are headed to vacation in two weeks. Atlanta has played better lately winning two straight games, but this is a big step up in competition. The Rams will be rested, having played last Thursday, and I they will play well in a bounce-back spot. Rams win it.Pick: Rams 31, Falcons 21   \n            ",

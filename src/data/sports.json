L.A. is also facing a team with an 8-9 record, and teams with losing records are 2-6 in the playoffs all-time. The Rams have the league's best offense, ranking first in points, total yards and yards per play, and it's a unit that doesn't hurt itself as no one has committed fewer penalties. Matthew Stafford has two touchdowns and no interceptions in each of his last three postseason starts, and the MVP contender is riding a seven-game playoff streak with multiple touchdown passes. This season, Stafford has more TD passes (46) than Carolina has total touchdowns (35) as the Panthers rank 27th in both points scored and total yards. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Panthers can coverIt was just six weeks ago that Carolina upset the Rams as double-digit underdogs, forcing Stafford into three turnovers. The Panthers have 10 ATS wins as an underdog this year, the most in the NFL, and they also have a one-day rest advantage after playing last Saturday. The Rams have lost three of their last four road games, and the Panthers are decidedly more potent on offense at Bank of America Stadium.

    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL playoffs are set, and teams like the Texans and Jaguars enter in on win streaks of nine and eight games, respectively, and could be highly sought after with NFL picks. Meanwhile, Green Bay is riding a four-game losing streak and is a 1.5-point favorite against the Bears on Saturday night, per the latest Wild Card Weekend NFL odds.Those two split their regular season matchups as they'll tangle in the postseason for just the third time ever. The NFL line for that game matches Bills vs. Jaguars (+1.5) as the slimmest of the Wild Card Weekend NFL spreads, while the largest has the Rams favored by 10.5 points over the Panthers. Other spreads include 49ers vs. Eagles (-4.5), Chargers vs. Patriots (-3.5) and Steelers vs. Texans (-3). All of the updated Wild Card Weekend NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Wild Card Weekend NFL picks now.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

These teams have the same 9-8 spread record, but Pittsburgh is 4-1 ATS over its last five, while Houston has failed to cover in two of its last three. While Houston has an elite defense, it allowed its most points (30) all year in Week 18 to a Colts team with a fourth-string rookie quarterback, which is no comparison to an Aaron Rodgers-led unit getting back a rested DK Metcalf. As for C.J. Stroud, he is 0-2 on the road in his playoffs career, failing to account for a touchdown in either loss. The Steelers are forecasted to cover over 50% of the time, with the Over hitting in well over 50% of simulations. See which other teams to pick here, and bet the Steelers using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nHow to make Wild Card NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Wild Card Weekend NFL schedule and just revealed three teams projected to outright win over 60% of the time, potentially giving you a huge payday.

Jaylen Brown is averaging 29.6 points, 6.3 rebounds and 4.9 assists per game this season, with Derrick White adding 18.4 ppg as five Celtics are averaging double-digit ppg this season.

The Knicks are allowing 124.3 ppg over their last seven contests, and five of their last seven games have reached at least 225 points. New York has the No. 4 scoring offense in the league at 119.7 ppg this season, and the Clippers are averaging 118 ppg over their last seven games.

Now the Bruins must travel to Cedar Falls, arguably the toughest alligator pit in the Valley, as Ben Jacobson seems to have created his perfect team in a hoops laboratory. The Panthers have experience with several multi-year starters, practice patience, and work every possession on both ends of the court, which is one reason why UNI leads the nation in scoring defense (57.3 ppg). The extension of Jacobson on the floor is fourth-year PG Trey Campbell, enjoying his best season yet (13.1 ppg and 3.7 apg).\" Back Northern Iowa at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:\nWant more NBA, college basketball picks for Wednesday?You've seen some of the model's Wednesday best bets.

    "body": "\n        Legendary NHL goaltender Glenn \"Mr. Goalie\" Hall died Wednesday. He was 94. Hall spent 18 seasons in the NHL and was one of the most decorated goalies in the history of the sport, culminating with his Hall of Fame induction in 1975.A three-time Vezina Trophy winner and a two-time Stanley Cup champion, Hall posted a career 2.50 goals against average and .918 save percentage. His 84 shutouts rank fourth all-time, and he owns one of more unbreakable records in NHL history. From 1995-62, Hall started 502 consecutive games for the Detroit Red Wings and Chicago Blackhawks. The next longest streak belongs to Alec Connell, who started 257 straight games.Between his elite numbers, laundry list of accolades and his status as one of the greatest ironmen in sports history, Hall established himself as a true hockey legend.\n\"Glenn was a true star, whose career was filled with accomplishment and accolades,\" NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said in a statement. \"From the moment he stepped foot in an NHL crease, Hall excelled. He won the Calder Trophy with the Red Wings, earned every win for the Blackhawks in their run to the 1961 Stanley Cup, and captured a Conn Smythe Trophy despite losing in the Final with the St. Louis Blues. A seven-time, first-team NHL All-Star - an honor bestowed on him more than any other goalie - Hall is an honored member of the Hockey Hall of Fame and was selected as one of the NHL's 100 Greatest Players.\"\nHall's career was so great that he won a Stanley Cup before ever playing a game. The Red Wings called him up from the minors for the 1952 playoffs, but Hall didn't appear in any games as the team went on to win the Cup and Hall had his name etched on the trophy.In 1955-56, Hall got his first real shot at the NHL level when he replaced the great Terry Sawchuk. He quickly asserted himself as one of the game's best goalies and won the Calder Trophy that season.Following the 1956-57 campaign, the Red Wings traded Hall to the Blackhawks, where he played the bulk of his career. In 10 seasons with the team, Hall won 276 games while posting a 2.60 GAA, .916 save percentage and 51 shutouts. In 1961, Hall backstopped Chicago to the Stanley Cup. In 1988, the Blackhawks retired Hall's No. 1 jersey.\nHall was left unprotected in the 1967 expansion draft, and he was selected by the St. Louis Blues. Even in those late stages of his career, Hall was still a tremendous player. In the 1968 Stanley Cup Playoffs, Hall boasted a .916 save percentage and powered the Blues to the Stanley Cup Final where they lost to the Montreal Canadiens. Despite that loss, Hall won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the playoff MVP, one of just six players in history to win the award as a member of the losing team.Hall entered a brief retirement following the 1968-69 season but returned to play in each of the next two seasons. He finally hung up his skates for good in 1979. Hall then became a goaltending coach, and he was on the coaching staff of the Calgary Flames when they won the Stanley Cup in 1989.Hall was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1975, and his impact can still be felt today. Hall was one of the pioneers of the butterfly technique in which goalies drop down to the ice to stop the puck, completely changing the way the position was played.\n            ",

    "body": "\nArsenal are 14 points clear of Liverpool in the Premier League table when the two sides meet on Thursday, Jan. 8 in the second matchup of the year between them. Liverpool are one of two clubs to defeat Arsenal in domestic play, though the Gunners have been able to pull away from most of the league in an effort to capture the club's first EPL title since 2003-04. Arsenal enter this match on a five-game winning streak while Liverpool have drawn their last two matches after winning three in a row.Kickoff from Emirates Stadium in London is set for 3 p.m. ET. Arsenal are -180 favorites (wager $180 to win $100) in the latest Arsenal vs. Liverpool odds at DraftKings Sportsbook while Liverpool are +475 underdogs (wager $100 to win $475). A draw is priced at +330 and the total is set at 2.5 (Over -135, Under +105). You can find the latest projections for Arsenal vs. Liverpool at SportsLine but before locking in any bets, you should see where soccer expert Jon Eimer is leaning towards for this high-stakes clash.Eimer finished 2023 as SportsLine's No. 1 soccer expert, posting a 248-234-12 (+25.93 units) record on SportsLine article picks. Eimer has been red-hot in 2025, posting a profit in multiple leagues, including the Premier League, Champions League, La Liga and more. Anyone following his soccer betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting apps could have seen huge returns.  Here are Eimer's best bets and analysis for Arsenal vs. Liverpool on Thursday.Arsenal vs. Liverpool best betsArsenal money line and Over 1.5 goals (-120): 1uBoth teams to score (-120): 1uExact score: Arsenal 3-1 (+1200): 1uManchester City keep dropping pointsArsenal have been motivated all season as the team is pressing towards a long overdue EPL title. The team, however, has found some additional motivation as Manchester City keep dropping points. The Citizens have now dropped points from a winning position in back-to-back fixtures. We watched them lose two points after a draw to Chelsea, followed by a 1-1 draw to Brighton.This means that a victory against Liverpool would put Arsenal a full nine points ahead of the next best team on the table. Arsenal will look to be as aggressive as ever knowing the importance of three points against a club as big as Liverpool.Liverpool's key absencesLiverpool have put together a strong run of performances as they are unbeaten in the last nine matches. While they are not losing, they still don't look like their usual dominate self, having dropped points to Fulham and Leeds. They barely beat Wolves 2-1. This team is struggling to find form and their injuries and international duties aren't helping.Alexander Isak and Hugo Ekitike are both out in this match due to injury while Mo Salah is still gone for AFCON duties. The lack of a clear goalscorer and a leaky backline means that Liverpool are in for a rough time against the best club in Europe. I still believe Liverpool will score as Arsenal have conceded in four of their last five but ultimately, this should be a comfortable three points for the Gunners.\n            ",

Jalen Hurts is one of just two quarterbacks in the playoffs this year who has won a Super Bowl along with Matthew Stafford and Aaron Rodgers. The Steelers quarterback actually has more career playoff wins than every other QB in the AFC playoff field combined. There are also plenty of new faces in the postseason this year, including six teams that didn't make the playoffs last year with the Seahawks, 49ers, Panthers, Bears, Patriots and Jaguars all getting in. The final five teams in that group all lost at least 11 games last year before rebounding to make the postseason this year. The Panthers are in playoffs for the first time since 2017 and they'll be kicking off the postseason this year by hosting the Saturday afternoon game. With that in mind, let's get to the full playoff schedule. \n        \n            \n                Renner's 2026 NFL mock draft 6.0: Raiders, Jets land QBs with top picks; Ty Simpson to Super Bowl contender\n                \n                    Mike Renner                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWild Card WeekendSaturday, Jan. 10(5) Rams at (4) Panthers, 4:30 p.m. ET (Fox) (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)(7) Packers at (2) Bears, 8 p.m. ET (Amazon Prime)Sunday, Jan. 11(6) Bills at (3) Jaguars, 1 p.m. ET (CBS) (Stream on Paramount+)(6) 49ers at (3) Eagles, 4:30 p.m. ET (Fox) (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)(7) Chargers at (2) Patriots, 8 p.m. ET (NBC)Monday, Jan. 12(5) Texans at (4) Steelers, 8 p.m. ET (ESPN/ABC) (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)Divisional RoundSaturday, Jan. 17AFC or NFC divisional matchup, 4:30 p.m. ET AFC or NFC divisional matchup, 8 p.m. ETSunday, Jan. 18AFC or NFC divisional matchup, 3 p.m. ETAFC or NFC divisional matchup, 6:30 p.m. ETNote: The winner of the Monday night game in the wild card round will play on Sunday in the divisional round.

    "body": "\n        With the calendar flipping to 2026, we're officially in a World Cup year, and performances mean quite a bit more for players looking to make the squads of teams who have qualified. A run of form at the right time can be the difference between making the squad and watching from the couch at home. It's even more significant if you play for a host country like the United States, as Leeds' Brenden Aaronson does. His brace on Wednesday may not have been enough to secure victory over Newcastle United as they lost 4-3, but it is a moment that shows how a confident Aaronson has arrived in the Premier League at just the right time. It's the second consecutive game with a goal for Aaronson, and now his fourth goal contribution (three goals and one assist) in the past four games for Leeds. He couldn't pick a better time to round into form, both helping the team move further away from the relegation zone and also strengthening his case for Mauricio Pochettino's World Cup squad. Neither of those things seemed close to a given for Aaronson at the beginning of the season.Despite playing a large role in Leeds United's return to the top flight from the Championship, Aaronson had to fight for his spot in the Premier League. It's something that he's familiar with after falling out of the starting XI during the 2022-23 season when Leeds were relegated to the Championship and then having been sent on loan to Union Berlin in the Bundesliga, for the following season, where he then struggled for playing time. Once again needing to earn his spot was just another preseason for the American. \nUnder Daniel Farke, Aaronson has done just that, and he's also been played in a more advanced role, almost as a second forward with striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin. It's a role that he's been thriving in now, netting his fourth goal of the season. Not known as a goal scorer by trade, that's Aaronson's highest goal return ever in a top five league, and currently is in a tie as his third best league scoring season for any of the clubs that he's ever played at. With 2.89 expected goals on the season, Aaronson's running a little hot, but he's not drastically overperforming either, and with shots like his against Newcastle, you can see why he's doing more with less (his goals have come from a grand total of 13 shots on target).\nThat's a finish of a confident player, and at 25, Aaronson is playing some of the best soccer of his career, which is also being noticed by the national team. After being left out of the USMNT's squad for the Concacaf Nations League and the September international window under Pochettino, it seemed like Aaronson might be at risk of not making the World Cup, but as the USMNT closed out 2025 with three consecutive wins, the Leeds man was involved in all of them.\nIt's still a long road to make the World Cup in 2026, but Aaronson is doing what he needs to do to ensure that he'll have a chance for the next tests along the way, friendlies facing Belgium and Portugal in March. Pass those tests, and the second World Cup of Aaronson's career could be in his future. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Field-goal percentage can quietly swing fantasy matchups, especially when high-usage guards start piling up inefficient nights. Whether it's the result of tougher defensive attention, expanded offensive roles, or a growing reliance on 3-point volume, several notable backcourt players are having trouble converting their looks this season. In this article, we highlight 10 guards whose shooting efficiency has dipped well below expectations, examining the trends behind their struggles and what they mean for fantasy managers. From established stars to emerging scorers, these players present important decisions on whether to stay patient, adjust expectations, or explore roster alternatives.Derrick White, CelticsWhite has shot below 43 percent just twice in his eight NBA seasons, but could be on track to do it again, as he is shooting a career-low 39.7 percent from the field. Part of the reason for the dip is the fact that he is also shooting a career-high 9.4 3-pointers per game and hitting 34 percent from deep. However, he shot 9.1 3s last season and still managed a field-goal percentage of 44.2 on the year, which, although being the lowest among his three full seasons with the Celtics, is still significantly better than his current rate. On the other hand, he is also dealing with a lot more defensive attention while having to take on a larger role in the offense with the absence of Jayson Tatum. Donte DiVincenzo, TimberwolvesDiVincenzo is working on his lowest field-goal percentage in the last four seasons and the third-lowest among his eight seasons, as he is shooting just 40.5 percent from the field. Similar to the case of many players on this list, a major reason for the dip in field-goal percentage is the fact that an increasing amount of his shot attempts are coming from long range, as he is averaging 8.1 3-point attempts among his total of 10.6 field-goal attempts per game. However, in addition to a large portion of his shots being from distance, his long-range shooting is struggling in relation to the last three seasons, where he shot better than 39 percent in each. LaMelo Ball, HornetsBall has yet to average better than 44 percent shooting from the field in a season and is currently working on a 41.1 percent average through 26 games played this campaign. On the other hand, he is showing better efficiency from deep, going from 11.2 3-point attempts with 33.9 percent accuracy last season to 8.8 3-point attempts with 37.1 percent accuracy this season. His current 3.3 made 3-pointers per game would be the third-most in his career, matching up behind the only other two seasons where he took more attempts. \nRussell Westbrook, Kings Although he recently became the highest-scoring point guard in NBA history, it has been a common criticism throughout Westbrook's career that his scoring lacks efficiency. Unfortunately, that is certainly the case this season, as his 41.6 percent shooting from the field represents the lowest mark of his career aside from his rookie season. He is shooting 5.5 3s per game, which makes this just the third time in his career that he is averaging more than five per game, but his finishing from closer range is still lagging enough to drag his overall percentage to such notable lows. Devin Vassell, SpursVassell shot 47.2 percent from the field in 2023-24, and then 44.3 percent in 2024-25. However, this year he is down to 42.2 percent shooting, which is on track for the second-lowest mark of his career. His long-range shooting is holding up, as he is hitting 37.9 percent on seven attempts per game, but he is not having the same relative success elsewhere on the court. The recent struggles could be a result of him having a tough time finding his groove in the offense, as the Spurs now have a number of other very capable creators and scorers who are taking up more of the offensive flow compared to recent seasons. Bennedict Mathurin, Pacers At the beginning of the season, it seemed that Mathurin had the path laid out for a perfect opportunity to take his game to the next level, as his squad needed someone to help fill the offensive void left in the absence of Tyrese Haliburton. However, after a dominant first couple of games, he was struck with an injury that kept him out for about three weeks. Since then, despite averaging 16.6 points per game, he has not been able to establish a great rhythm, shooting just 40.9 percent from the field over his last 22 games. Some of his struggles could be affected by the team's injury issues, but it is more likely that he is still getting used to an expanded role and more defensive attention, as his squad is looking to him as a preferred offensive option. \nImmanuel Quickley, RaptorsQuickley is shooting just 43 percent from the field, which is unimpressively on pace for his third-best mark in his six seasons. Just over half of his 13 field-goal attempts per game are 3-pointers, of which he is knocking down a decent 35.7 percent. Nonetheless, he is filling an important role by pushing the pace for a talented and sizable lineup around him, delivering a career-best 6.2 assists per game.James Harden, ClippersAs another player who takes a significant amount of shots from deep, Harden has shot above 45 percent from the field just three times in his 16 seasons. He is knocking down 43.3 percent of his shots this season, which is actually better than his previous two campaigns with the Clippers. He is also averaging more than nine 3-point attempts per game for a fifth time in his career, hitting 35.8 percent from the outside. Although he has shot larger volumes from long range in the past, at 36 years old, he is less able to augment his efficiency with as many drives to the basket and creative finishes, contributing to a lower overall shooting percentage in recent years.  Anfernee Simons, CelticsDespite shooting just 43.3 percent from the field, Simons is working on the fourth-best shooting percentage of his eight seasons. After shooting over eight 3s per game during the last three seasons, he is down to 6.5 3s per game in a significantly decreased role with his new squad. However, the reduction in responsibility has not been helpful in him finding his rhythm, as he has only reached the 20-point mark six times in 35 games, which is a significant drop back from the 38 instances in 70 outings last season. \nQuentin Grimes, 76ersGrimes is hitting just 43.5 percent from the field this season, but is also knocking down 36.5 percent of his career-high 6.6 3-point attempts per game. However, he has recorded better than 46 percent from the field twice in his previous four campaigns and has shot better than 38 percent from the field in three of those seasons. After starting during most of his time with the 76ers last season, he is back in a bench role, which could also be affecting his ability to find his comfort zone.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Atlanta Hawks are trading Trae Young to the Washington Wizards, according to ESPN. The Wizards will send CJ McCollum and Corey Kispert to Atlanta in the deal. There is reportedly no draft compensation in the deal. The trade marks the end of Young's seven-plus-season tenure with the Hawks. The man who drafted him for the Hawks, Travis Schlenk, is currently the vice president of player personnel for the Wizards, so the two will now reunite in Washington and attempt to finish what they started in Atlanta.Young's tenure with the Hawks began with quite a bit of promise. In just his third NBA season, Young led the Hawks to the 2021 Eastern Conference finals, and had he not been hurt in the series, Atlanta might have gone even further. He's made four All-Star Games as a Hawk, including last season, and even earned All-NBA honors in 2022, establishing himself as Atlanta's franchise player for the better part of the past decade.But a few things have changed of late that conspired to push Young toward a trade. Atlanta's front office has turned over multiple times during Young's career, with the current group led by Onsi Saleh taking over last offseason. He was on his third permanent head coach in Atlanta as well, with Quin Snyder taking the job in 2023. That meant that many of the decision-makers that built around him early in his career were gone.\nThis season, the Hawks underperformed with Young on the floor. Meanwhile, when he sat, the Hawks shared the ball, played faster and, more importantly, played better defense than they ever had with the small, often indifferent defensively Young. This is indicative of a league-wide shift. The NBA is simply less interested in small, defensively-deficient guards that can't shoot well enough to play off of the ball than it used to, as characterized by the seemingly limited trade interest Ja Morant has drawn this season well. Such players can still have a place on competitive teams, but not at max salaries.Atlanta was staring down the barrel of a $49 million player option for Young next season that would have deprived them of significant flexibility to build around their younger cornerstones. By moving Young now, they set themselves up to either generate significant cap space in the summer or use that flexibility to trade for another veteran like Anthony Davis now.\n\n        \n            \n                Trae Young trade rumors: Why a Hawks-Wizards deal would make sense for both sides\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Wizards, with nearly limitless cap flexibility on a roster devoid of expensive veterans, had no such issues with Young's cap figure. They could afford to take a buy-low risk on Young with the idea that he could help develop their raw, younger players. As talented as many of their recent first-round picks are, having a traditional point guard on board to set them up will only make their lives easier. Now the Wizards, who have not reached the playoffs since 2021, have taken their first true steps out of the lottery and toward competing for the postseason.\n            ",

The trio -- along with a fourth suspect -- are accused of stealing $200,000 in property from the Cleveland Browns quarterback during his NFL debut in Week 11.While Sanders was getting his first taste of NFL action, three suspects allegedly entered Sanders' home wearing masks and gloves shortly before 7 p.m. and made off with roughly $200,000 in property. A fourth suspect was driving the vehicle that transported the group. While three of those suspects are now in custody, one more remains at large with an active warrant out for his arrest.Sanders is far from the only high-profile NFL player who has been burglarized during a game. In 2024, the homes of Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce were robbed during a game. Additionally, Joe Burrow's house was broken into during a \"Monday Night Football\" game.On the day his home was robbed, Sanders replaced an injured Dillon Gabriel against the Baltimore Ravens. In his first NFL game, Sanders completed four of his 16 passing attempts for 47 yards and an interception. Sanders remained the Browns' starting quarterback for the rest of the season, completing 56.6% of his passes for 1,400 yards, seven touchdowns and 10 interceptions.\nSanders and the entire Browns organization is entering a new era this offseason after the firing of coach Kevin Stefanski, who spent six seasons with the team.\n            \n    ",

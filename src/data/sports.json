    "body": "\n        Never one to need help from the judges, hard-hitting welterweight Uros Medic recorded the biggest knockout of his career on Saturday in the co-main event UFC Fight Night in Houston.Medic (13-3), who has yet to have a fight go to the scorecards as a professional, landed a grazing left hook to the temple of veteran Geoff Neal and knocked him out cold at 1:19 of Round 1. The victory was his third straight, all by knockout, as the 32-year-old native of Serbia brought the Toyota Center crowd to its feet. \"Houston, we have a problem and it's me! I am the problem,\" Medic said. \"This division is in trouble. They need some of this, they need it, and I'm here to deliver. I'm going to knock everybody out and bulldoze through this division.\"Neal (16-8), a 35-year-old native of Texas, countered an early body kick to land a short left cross. Medic answered with some slick boxing of his own before the two heavy punchers landed right hands simultaneously in the center of the Octagon.\nMedic began to quickly open up and walk Neal down. He missed a pair of short hooks while switching stances before connecting on a perfect left hand to end the fight as Neal's head hit hard on the canvas forcing referee Kerry Hatley to instantly waive off the fight. \n\"I knock everybody out, everyone,\" Medic said. \"Sure, I lose sometimes but I'm just a human being. I may lose again but you bet your ass I'm going to come back and f---ing knock people out again.\"I knew [Neal] was going to want to box with me. Not a lot of guys want to box with me. I am an MMA fighter but boxing is something I love to do. I'm sorry this had to happen in front of his home crowd but this is the sport we are in. It's hard to watch. I have been on the wrong end of that but you get up and you keep f---ing going because life can hit 100 times harder than any man can.\"Neal lost for the fourth time in five fights and suffered his second straight knockout defeat. After the fight, Medic called out former welterweight champion Leon Edwards.\n\"Let's get this work in,\" Medic said. \"I'll be knocking everyone out.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The gold medal matchup that everyone in North America hoped for has come to fruition. Team USA and Canada are set to settle their intense rivalry with a gold medal on the line.The two best teams in this Olympic field, the U.S. and Canada had to fight to get here. The Americans needed overtime to beat Sweden in the quarterfinals, and the Canadians required third-period comebacks to beat Czechia and Finland in the knockout rounds. With both squads now battle-tested, this gold medal game has all the ingredients for an all-time classic.\"I think this is a whole new experience,\" Team USA coach Mike Sullivan said when asked about the rematch from last year's 4 Nations Face Off. \"When you look at the two games that were played in the 4 Nations tournament, they were pretty evenly played games on both sides. We came out on the right side on one and the wrong side on the other. So what I can tell you is that the American team is the best team I've ever been around.\"The group of players has a certain personality to them that is contagious with their energy and their resilience and their care for one another and how hard they play for each other. I couldn't be more proud of them.\"\nOn paper, these are two evenly-matched teams, and the oddsmakers see it as a toss-up too. According to DraftKings, the Canadians are slight favorites at -125 with the Americans at +105 odds.\n        \n            \n                Team USA vs. Canada: Ranking the 10 best players in the gold medal game of the 2026 Winter Olympics\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBefore the puck drops on this highly anticipated clash of the hockey titans, we'll take a deeper look at the matchup and make our pick for the gold medal winner.Where to watch USA vs. CanadaDate: Sunday, Feb. 22 | Time: 8:10 a.m. ETLocation: Milano Santagiulia Arena -- Milan, ItalyTV: NBCOdds: Canada -125, USA +105\nUSA vs. Canada previewThe U.S. and Canada are two different teams with two very different strengths. The Canadians are built on an elite core of forwards with a lineup capable of scoring in bunches, and the Americans are built to prevent that very thing. Which philosophy will win out on Sunday?Thus far, the Canadians scored their way out of trouble, and Connor McDavid and Macklin Celebrini are lethal together on the first line. Canada also brings Nathan MacKinnon, the leading scorer in the NHL, as its second-line center. The real wild card here is the health of Sidney Crosby. He missed the semifinal game with a lower-body injury, and if he can go, Crosby gives Canada incredible depth as the third-line center. If Crosby misses the game, that matchup gets more favorable for the U.S. with Nick Suzuki slotting in there.Mitch Marner, Bo Horvat and Brandon Hagel bring playmaking and scoring on the wings. Marner was the hero in Canada's overtime win over Czechia, pulling off a show-stopping move to win the game.\nThe Americans have a nice one-two punch down the middle as well, even if they don't have the offensive ceilings of McDavid and MacKinnon. Jack Eichel and Auston Matthews are elite two-way players, and they've lived up to that billing in Milan. That duo has its work cut out for it in trying to contain their Canadian counterparts, but Eichel and Matthews are capable of doing it at their best. Larkin is a great third-line center for Team USA, and he's been heating up over the last two games.On the wings, the U.S. brings a balance of skill and sandpaper. Matthew and Brady Tkachuk embody that dynamic, blending physicality with finesse around the net. The most interesting winger for the Americans, however, is known more for his flash. Jack Hughes has made some brilliant plays at the Olympics, and he's playing at a superstar level, which is good for the U.S.\"It's been 46 years. So many players that have paved the way for us that haven't had a chance to win gold for us, that for our dream to be right there,\" Tkachuk said. \"It's something that we're not taking lightly. And I mean, we have an opportunity to achieve a childhood dream.\"\nDefense is where the balance of power shifts to the U.S. Led by Quinn Hughes and Zach Werenski, the Americans are loaded on the blue line. Those two are excellent puck-movers who can be trust to contribute in all three zones, but the U.S. has plenty of versatility behind them. Jaccob Slavin is one of the best shutdown defenders in the NHL, and Brock Faber fits well beside him in a similar role. Charlie McAvoy is great in his own end -- and he's not afraid to lay the lumber -- but he can also chip in on offense. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Jake Sanderson as an underrated star either.The Canadian defense has more questions. They have the best defenseman in the world in Cale Makar, but the team's decision not to take more players with offensive upside was exacerbated by Josh Morrissey's injury early in the tournament. Drew Doughty and Travis Sanheim are fine in their own end, but they can't be relied upon consistently in the offensive zone. The same could be said for Colton Parayko, who is there for more of a physical presence. Shea Theodore and Thomas Harley have some offensive chops, but the latter is having a poor season with the Dallas Stars.In goal, we have a real conundrum. Connor Hellebuyck is arguably the best goalie in the world, but he has been known to shrink in the Stanley Cup Playoffs. Jordan Binnington is statistically the worst goalie in the NHL this season, but all he does is turn into Martin Brodeur on hockey's biggest stages. The U.S. has the edge on paper, but history and experience tell us the goaltender position might be more of a wash.\nUSA vs. Canada predictionThe Americans have been tormented by the Canadians on the world stage for my entire lifetime. I've seen 2002 in Salt Lake City, 2010 in Vancouver, 2014 in Sochi and last year in the 4 Nations Face-Off. The U.S. hasn't been able to slay this Red-and-White dragon in a game that really matters.However, this is the best American team that's ever been assembled, and it's right there with the Canadians as the most talented squad in the world. Canada still holds an edge, but as Czechia and Finland have proved, it's by no means immortal. Beyond that, Team USA was built with the idea in mind that it would have to slow down this Canada team. Were some of the roster decisions made in service of that mission highly questionable? Yes, but the Americans have a real identity.If I were making this prediction five days ago, I may have gone a different direction. The Canadians looked unstoppable in the preliminary round, and the Americans didn't always look like juggernauts. That said, the U.S.has developed chemistry over the course of this tournament, and it's improved with each passing game. Meanwhile, Canada has struggled with inferior opponents in its last two matchups.\nPerhaps it's recency bias, but one team has looked better than the other over the last couple of games. The Americans seem to be hitting their stride just in time for this showdown with Canada, and I think they find a way to harass the Canadian defense and get to Jordan Binnington.

Entering the day, the Buckeyes are among the \"Last Four In\" the projected tournament, according to the CBS Sports Bracketology model.Slaying the Spartans would do wonders for Ohio State's hopes of reaching the Big Dance for the first time since 2022. It would also be good for the Big Ten's hopes of earning the most bids to this year's tournament. While UCLA earned a big-time bubble victory over Illinois on Saturday and is now a No. 10 seed, USC is going the other direction.Trojans leading scorer Chad Baker-Mazara returned from a three-game absence due to a knee strain on Saturday, but USC suffered a devastating 71-70 home loss to Oregon anyway. The Trojans led by six with 1:10 remaining before a stunning late collapse that could haunt them on Selection Sunday. USC entered the day as a No. 10 seed in CBS Sports Bracketology but is now among the First Four Out after an inexplicable stumble against a Ducks squad that is just 10-17 (3-13 Big Ten).Indiana has been dropped for the moment to \"Next Four Out\" status by the CBS Sports Bracketology model due to a striking lack of Quad 1 and 2 victories. At just 4-10 across the top two quadrants, the Hoosiers have fewer victories in the top two quadrants than any team in the top 50 of the NET aside from Miami (Ohio). Here is the bubble breakdown entering Sunday's action.Last Four InMissouriSanta ClaraNew MexicoTCU\nFirst Four OutCalVCUSeton HallUSCNext Four OutIndianaVirginia TechSan Diego StateArizona StateCheck out the CBS Sports Bracketology model's latest bracket at the Bracketology hubAll times below Eastern Bubble teams in action Sunday\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Ohio State Sunday at No. 15 Michigan State | 1 p.m. (CBS)Entering the day: Last Four InGame status: Quad 1 \nOhio State is still searching for its first Quad 1 win.

    "body": "\n        Motor sports have skyrocketed in popularity over the last few years, which has brought mainstream sports fans to F1 betting and NASCAR betting through pop culture, including the Daytona 500. We'll take a look at how sportsbooks operate when it comes to motor sports, how bettors can wager on racing events and go over some of the best strategies and tips when it comes to racing betting.Finding the best sportsbook promos for motor sports bettingHere's a look at some of the promotions going on at top sportsbooks for fans interested in getting into motor sports betting.BrandPromoCBS promo codeDraftKingsBet $5, get $200 in bonus bets if your bet winsJust click hereFanDuelBet $5, get $100 in bonus bets if your bet winsJust click hereCaesarsFirst Bet Matched up to $250 as a Bonus Bet, Win or LoseCBSSPORTS250BMBetMGMUp to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet losesCBSSPORTSFanatics10 x $100 Bet Match in FanCash CBSFANbet365Bet $5, get $150 in bonus bets win or loseCBSBET365DraftKings, FanDuel and bet365 are all offering \"bet and get\" promotions where users get bonus bets after wagering $5 or more. FanDuel and DraftKings require a user's first bet to win, while bet365 provides bonus bets regardless of the outcome of the qualifying bet.BetMGM and Fanatics Sportsbook are also giving out bonus bets, but in a different way. BetMGM covers a user's first bet up to $1,500 with bonus bets if that first bet loses, but users must wager at least $1,500 to be eligible for the full amount. Fanatics has shifted its promotion to specific days where users can wager up to $100 on football and receive bonus bets back if their wager loses.Caesars Sportsbook offers a first bet match up to $250 as a bonus bet, win or lose. The first bet must have minimum -500 odds. Before you get into motor sports betting, it's important to find a sportsbook that consistently provides odds for races. There's always value in shopping around multiple sportsbooks for the best lines, but some platforms do not offer extensive betting markets for motorsports compared to others.What do motor sports odds mean?When it comes to motorsports and racing markets, odds are displayed and read similarly to how they are for most sports. Let's say a driver is priced at -150 to win the Dutch Grand Prix on Aug. 31, and the next best driver has +200 odds. That means the driver at -150 is a decent favorite to win, and you'd have to risk $150 to win $100. The second driver is a contender but is unlikely to win in the eyes of oddsmakers, but you'd win $200 after risking $100 if he does indeed pull off the upset.When you can bet on motor sports oddsThe racing schedule varies across NASCAR, F1 and IndyCar but there are usually weekly races with occasional breaks. NASCAR has multiple series, so there's usually at least one race across the series every weekend. F1 has a set calendar for the year with some breaks in between, but there are junior Formula racing series which might be going on in some of the gaps on the main circuit.Typically, the actual race will take place on a Sunday. There will be practice on either Thursday or Friday, with a qualifying event to set up the grid on either Friday or Saturday depending on the race schedule. Qualifying usually takes place the day before the race. Bettors can wager on qualifying outcomes as well, and those results will shift the race odds.Biggest races for motor sports bettingArguably, the biggest sporting event in the racing world is the Indianapolis 500, which is traditionally held on Memorial Day weekend. That's the premier IndyCar event.NASCAR has several big races, with the Daytona 500, a Crown Jewel event, regarded as the richest race on the circuit. The Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte and the Brickyard 400 are also considered Crown Jewel events. Talladega Speedway is a widely known track thanks to the movie \"Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby\", but it is not a Crown Jewel event.Every F1 race has its unique twist, as the tracks are different in each city, but Monaco is considered the biggest spectacle of the season. The race itself is somewhat mundane, as there's little opportunity for drivers to pass each other. The British Grand Prix at Silverstone, the Italian Grand Prix at Monza and the Singapore Grand Prix are considered some marquee events on the F1 calendar. The Abu Dhabi Grand Prix is also a high-profile event as it is typically last on the calendar and could decide who wins the drivers championship and constructors championship. F1 has also added special events like Miami and Las Vegas.Types of bets and how motor sports betting works Like all sports betting markets, there are a variety of ways prospective bettors can wager on motor sports. Here's a look at some of them.Outright/To Win oddsThis market is straightforward. Users are betting on which driver will win the event. There are also markets here for which team/constructor car will win the event, which will have multiple cars involved.Placement/Top Finish oddsMotor sports betting offers users the ability to wager on drivers or teams having a certain placement or finishing within a certain range. For example, you can wager on drivers to place in the top 5 or top 10 of the event. You can do the same with teams/constructors.While it rarely occurs in racing, there's a possibility of multiple drivers tying for a position. In this case, technically there are multiple winning bets but sportsbooks grade dead heats differently and the payouts can be different. If FanDuel declares a dead heat, half the stake is applied at the original odds and half the stake is lost. If there are more than two dead heats, the stakes are proportioned accordingly.Dual ForecastThis is where bettors can place a wager on which drivers will finish first and second. Both drivers must finish in the correct order for this wager to be paid out as a win. For example, you can wager on Max Verstappen and Lando Norris to finish first and second, respectively in a Dual Forecast market in F1 betting. However, if Verstappen finishes second and Norris finishes first, your bet will lose even though you did correctly pick the top two drivers for the race.Each Way BettingThis might not be as common in motor sports but can be applied to racing betting. An each way bet basically places two wagers: a driver to win and to finish above another position. If the driver wins, both bets get paid out. The same applies for team bets in this market.Stage WinnerThis is prevalent in NASCAR and IndyCar, which has more laps than Formula One. You can bet on which driver or team will be in the lead after 25 laps, 50 laps, 100 laps and so on. These are the stages.Matchups/Head-to-HeadSportsbooks will put two drivers or two teams against each other and bettors can choose which one will place higher. For teams, the bet is usually on the highest-placed driver for that particular team. For example, if a market was being offered on F1 to see if Ferrari or Mercedes placed higher, a winning Ferrari driver would give Ferrari bettors the win even if the Mercedes drivers combined to finish higher than the Ferrari drivers.Group WinnerThis is offered in NASCAR. Sportsbooks will put a handful of drivers in groups and ask which will be the winner of the group.Top Car Make DriverThis is also specific to NASCAR, where you can bet on whether the winning driver will be in a particular car manufacturer, like Ford or Chevy. It's more applicable here since there are only two drivers on each F1 constructor, while car brands can span several NASCAR teams.Team of Race WinnerThis is similar to Outright Winner for drivers but applies to teams and constructors.Qualifying BetsBettors can wager on who will take pole position and which cars will be on pole. These are determined during qualifying racing, which typically takes place the day before the race. You can also bet on markets offering odds for who will finish in the top 5 or top 10 in qualifying, though these necessarily aren't available for every race. The results of qualifying will often shift the race odds.Motor sports futures bettingFormula 1 bettingIn most cases, F1 futures usually apply to the next race. However, you can bet on season-long futures for the drivers and constructors championships. The drivers championship is straightforward as it will be given to the driver who accumulates the most points over the season. The constructors championship takes into account the points for both team drivers. Only the top 10 finishers in each race score points, and those points are tallied over the season. The winning driver can be part of a constructors championship, but that's not always the case.NASCAR bettingNASCAR has different portions of the season. There are also different circuits like the Cup Series, the Xfinity Series and Truck Series. You can bet on marquee races for NASCAR in the futures market, and you can also wager on winners for these particular series.IndyCarThe major marquee futures market for IndyCar is the Indianapolis 500. Other than that race, there are season-long championship odds for the circuit.Can you parlay wagers in motor sports betting?While parlaying is generally not advised, as you don't get appropriate odds from sportsbooks that correspond to the actual chance of your bet winning, you are able to parlay outcomes in motor sports betting. While you can't pick multiple drivers to win an event in a parlay, you can pick multiple drivers to finish in the top 5 or top 10. You can also pick teams to finish in the top 5 or top 10.How to bet on motor sports live during a raceSportsbooks do offer live odds for motor sports, though this is likely a more prominent feature for NASCAR and IndyCar as opposed to F1. Driver and team odds will shift based on where they are in the grand scheme of the race. NASCAR and IndyCar allow for more leeway since there are more laps, while F1 can sometimes shift quickly towards one driver or team.Tips and strategies for how to bet on motor sportsDriver form does matter when it comes to racing, but the biggest predictor of success is usually how each team can adjust to conditions. Races can take place in all kinds of weather and team strategy can make or break the day. There are some teams that struggle to adjust, and bettors should know which teams those are before placing wagers.Historical track success does matter, but it often takes a back seat to current form. For example, Max Verstappen won the Canadian Grand Prix three years in a row and was a contender after starting second behind George Russell in 2025. Russell has had mixed results in Montreal historically but wound up winning the race after winning qualifying to take pole position.Longshots don't usually win races, but it's not uncommon to see them do well in the Placement markets. You can usually back drivers who have had success on certain tracks or who have routinely finished just outside of a certain position market to break through eventually.Occasionally, a caution flag comes out when there's a crash on the track, which makes racing conditions hazardous for everyone. When this happens, there will be a safety car deployed, and all drivers must line up behind the safety car until the wreck is managed. This has sometimes happened on the last lap of the race, which can completely eliminate the leader's edge on the field. There are different rules for each association and sometimes the race organizer makes a call in the moment, but usually, the race cannot end on a caution flag. If the wreck is too big to clear in a reasonable amount of time, the race will end despite the caution flag being signaled. Overtime doesn't really exist, but usually there will be at least one additional lap of racing should the fallout of the crash get removed in a timely manner and the safety car gets taken off the track.FAQCan you bet on motor sports?As long as you are of legal age in a state where sports betting is legitimate, you should be able to find a sportsbook which provides racing and motor sports odds.Who to bet on for the Indy 500?Because the Indy 500 typically takes place over Memorial Day weekend, you'll have to wait for a bit before placing wagers on who will win the signature event. Josef Newgarden won the Indy 500 in 2023 and 2024 but Alex Palou won in 2025 and is the reigning champion.Can you bet on SuperCross?SuperCross is a type of motorcycle racing and some sportsbooks do offer SuperCross odds in certain states.Can you bet on motocross at DraftKings?DraftKings does provide SuperCross odds, which is a motocross competition, in select states. You must be of legal age and residing in those states to bet on motocross at DraftKings.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        LAWRENCE, Kansas — Lost in the sauce of the never-ending Darryn Peterson discourse hides the fact that it's late February, and Kansas still doesn't know quite what makes it tick yet.Bill Self likes this team, but he sure wasn't tickled pink by how his group handled Saturday's test. Unranked Cincinnati waltzed into Allen Fieldhouse and drubbed No. 8 Kansas 84-68 handing the Jayhawks its first double-digit home loss to an unranked opponent since 1993, per CBS Sports research. \"We played soft,\" Self said matter-of-factly.Peterson's spotty availability status has become the story. It's often been distilled down to an argument like this: When Peterson plays, Kansas is  a national championship contender, but…Well, Peterson played a full allotment of 32 minutes against Cincinnati, the most minutes in two weeks, and yet, Kansas' home fans were dipping for the exits long before Saturday's final buzzer sounded.\nThere's been a fog (or Phog?) clouding the reality that Kansas is still in tinkering mode, while numerous other national championship hopefuls have cleared those hurdles and have elevated into a new zip code with March looming.Meanwhile, Kansas' hot-spots emerged for the world to see.KU big man Flory Bidunga has been one of the fiercest defensive players this season, but Cincinnati found real cracks in the armor on the edges of this Kansas defense. Cincinnati forward Baba Miller scored eight of his 12 first-half points when Bidunga was not guarding him. Big man Moustapha Thiam gave redshirt freshman Bryson Tiller the work early and often on the way to a 28-point, eight-rebound showing on his 20th birthday.\n\"That's one heck of a birthday present,\" Cincinnati coach Wes Miller said. \"We all got to feel like it was our birthday tonight. I mean, I didn't know he had 28. I knew he was playing great, but I thought he was terrific.\"\nThe other side of the aisle was not feeling like having a slice of birthday cake.\"I didn't think our bigs played very big today,\" Self said.That's a grave indictment for a national championship hopeful because teams like Michigan and Florida are driven by their enormous front-lines. Bidunga is generously listed at 6-foot-10 and 235 pounds. Tiller is 6-foot-11 but doesn't always play like it. A depth option like 7-footer Paul Mbiya is not part of this rotation right now. Is Kansas big enough to win this thing in the supersized era that is college basketball? On Saturday, it sure wasn't. Cincinnati ripped down 14 offensive rebounds, much to Self's chagrin.Kansas' offense was also entirely rudderless for long stretches. The Jayhawks managed just 1.04 points per possession and managed just two assists over a 15-minute span in a second half gone awry. Peterson scored 17 of the most invisible points. Melvin Council, long the emotional leader of this group, went 3-for-13 from the field. Outside of some empty-side pick-and-rolls for Bidunga to go Turbo Smash on the rim, Kansas' offense found no easy answers against a Cincinnati group that is a top-10 defense.\n\"It's terrible, we didn't play well,\" Self said. \"Against good teams, you're not going to score fast. You're not going to score on the first side (of the floor). We don't have that type of team, and we didn't screen, and we didn't do a lot of things the way that I would hope that we would do it. I got to do a better job of getting us to do. We've shown that we can do it at times, but we certainly didn't do it against a team that demands it being done because they're so sound.\"There isn't any time to lick wounds. No. 2 Houston will saunter into Lawrence on Monday, and the Cougars can steal some of Cincinnati's homework.Houston could out-rebound the Jayhawks by 21, not 11, if Kansas isn't careful. Houston's defense — which is even better than Cincinnati's — could wreck havoc against Kansas if this offense doesn't snap out of the stagnation.\n\"It just wasn't a very tough team today like we're capable of being,\" Self said. \"Hopefully, we get that mindset corrected here. We'll see…\"Kansas does not lose games at home. This is just the 23rd time that a Self-coached club has lost in this basketball cathedral. Back-to-back home losses feel unfathomable.\"Bad, brutal and it sucks,\" Council said. \"We are supposed to defend homecourt always. Losing to UConn, now Cincinnati. We can't do it no more.\"\nLet the tinkering begin because this team has plenty to learn about itself.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        No. 4 Arizona earned solo possession of first in the Big 12 standings on Saturday with a gritty 73-66 road win over No. 2 Houston. The shorthanded Wildcats used a 12-0 run in the second half to pull away and hand the Cougars their first home loss since Feb. 1 of last year.Arizona failed to reach 75 points for the first time since Dec. 20, but its defense carried the day, as Houston missed 10 straight field goal attempts late in the second half.Fresh off a season-high 22-point outing in a win over BYU, Anthony Dell'Orso turned in another massive game with 22 again for the Wildcats (25-2, 12-2 Big 12). Jaden Bradley and Ivan Kharchenkov added 17 and 16, respectively. With star freshman forward Koa Peat missing his second straight game due to a lower leg injury and reserve wing Dwayne Aristode out for a third straight game, Arizona deployed a rotation of basically just six players in the second half.\nHouston (23-4, 11-3) has dropped consecutive games for the first time since January 2024. Freshman guard Kingston Flemings led the Cougars with 17 points, but they never found an offensive rhythm and weren't as defensively disruptive as normal.\nAfter forcing a season-low three turnovers in a Monday loss at Iowa State, Houston forced just five against Arizona. Offensively, Houston's 35.7% shooting mark was its second-worst of the season.Big 12 title race heating upThe stretch run will likely be tense, but Arizona is now well-positioned to win the Big 12 regular season during just its second season in the league. A year ago, Houston ran away with the conference title by a whopping four-game edge while the Wildcats finished third for third along with BYU. \nAmong the Wildcats' final four regular season games are clashes with top-10 foes Kansas and Iowa State. But both those games are at home. The Iowa State game could prove particularly consequential as the Cyclones remain firmly in the league title hunt as well.Despite its recent two-game slide, Houston shouldn't be counted out, either. The Cougars face a challenging road game at Kansas on Monday, but their final three games are against manageable foes Colorado, Baylor and Oklahoma State.This is shaping up as the most intriguing conference title race in the high-major ranks.\nBracketology implicationsBoth teams learned where they stand in the eyes of the NCAA Tournament selection committee prior to the game. The Wildcats landed as the third No. 1 seed in the March Madness bracket preview while Houston landed as the second No. 2 seed. While it's possible Arizona could move up to become the second No. 1 seed depending on the results of Saturday night's clash between No. 1 Michigan and No. 3 Duke, the CBS Sports Bracketology model will make a definitive forecast Sunday morning once Saturday's full results -- and the changes in metrics they bring -- have been factored in.Houston is expected to remain a No. 2 seed. But with Florida making a hard charge after being named the top No. 3 seed in the bracket preview, the Cougars would be wise to beat Kansas on Monday to avoid a potential flirtation with the No. 3 seed line.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        One of college basketball's longest streaks in the AP poll era ended Saturday following Cincinnati's 84-68 thumping of eighth-ranked Kansas, a jolting setback for a Jayhawks team who were projected as a 3-seed in the East by the NCAA Tournament selection committee a few hours prior. The Jayhawks hadn't lost to an unranked team at home by 10 or more points since 1993, which spanned a nation-leading 425 consecutive games. Cincinnati 7-footer Moustapha Thiam poured in a career-high 28 points and helped the Bearcats pull away down the stretch with a 3-pointer with 7:35 to play after Kansas had moved within a possession.\"We were just awful today defensively,\" Kansas coach Bill Self said. \"They were great. Their bigs dominated. Their guards, we didn't pressure them and they got what they wanted to. ... it was a combination of defensive rebounding, their guards getting to where they want to go. But their bigs, they destroyed us.\"It was a particularly disheartening performance given the Jayhawks' play since overcoming a 1-2 start in Big 12 play to win nine of their last 10 games. Expecting another high-end outing Saturday afternoon coming off recent victories over BYU, Texas Tech and Utah, Kansas failed to land body blows in the second half to a Bearcats team that pulled to .500 this season in conference play.\nThe 16-point home loss was the Jayhawks' largest to an unranked opponent since 1973, besting a 15-point setback to Long Beach State in 1993 when Kansas was ranked No. 1.This marks the fourth-largest home loss Kansas has suffered under Self with all the others coming against ranked competition. Cincinnati made 12 of 21 attempts from behind the 3-point line and sent Jayhawks fans to the exits early with a home showdown against Houston looming on Monday night.Lost by 25 to No. 8 Texas on Jan. 2, 2021Lost by 23 to No. 14 TCU on Jan. 21, 2023Lost by 18 to No. 12 Kentucky on Jan. 29, 2022The Jayhawks were one of five Big 12 teams to receive a top-16 seed in Saturday's NCAA March Madness bracket preview. They'll try and regroup next week with the first of two pivotal contests against the conference's top teams.Self said his team played \"soft\" and had lacked energy on the glass after getting out-rebounded by Cincinnati, 40-29.\n\"We respected the opponent, but the bottom line is, we didn't bring it as a unit from an energy standpoint, like you got to when they're good,\" Self said. \"I mean, we played a NCAA Tournament team today. There's no doubt about that. They've had their moments this season where they've been inconsistent and not as good, but they were great today.\"\n            ",

The Cowboys made sure to give Williams a deal in line with his market value before he hit free agency to avoid having to replace his strong production from 2025. Williams rushed for 1,201 yards and 11 touchdowns on 252 carries for the Cowboys in 2025 -- reaching career-highs in all three categories. He also caught 35 passes out of the backfield for 137 yards and two touchdowns, providing Dak Prescott with a comfortable check down target. \nWith Williams' deal done, the Cowboys can shift their focus to their other free agents, with wide receiver George Pickens the most notable potential departure. Pickens also had a career-year in his first season in Dallas, tallying 1,429 receiving yards and nine touchdowns to lead the team in both categories. Pickens will be hoping to get a contract that pays him like the top-end receivers in the NFL, but it remains to be seen if Dallas is willing to make such a long-term offer with CeeDee Lamb already on a 4-year, $136 million deal (with $100 million guaranteed). If the two sides can't agree to a new deal, Lamb would be a prime franchise tag target for the Cowboys at a price of $28 million for the 2026 season. \nThe Cowboys have just over two weeks to get a Pickens deal done, but with Williams out of the way it's one fewer concern for Jerry Jones, Stephen Jones and the Cowboys ahead of the March 9 opening for the legal tampering period to free agency. \n            \n",

That's because what the selection committee told us during a 30-minute program on CBS is that if the 2026 NCAA Tournament would've started Saturday, the top two seeds in the bracket would've been Michigan and Duke. Point being that at least in the committee's eyes, what we had inside Capital One Arena was a No. 1 vs. No. 2 showdown 22 days before Selection Sunday.It wasn't pretty -- but it was fun.Final score: Duke 68, Michigan 63.Neither team played particularly well, especially on the offensive end. But the Blue Devils did score five more points than the Wolverines -- thanks largely to Cameron Boozer. The 6-foot-9 freshman took 10 shots, made six of them and finished with 18 points, 10 rebounds, seven assists and two blocks in 34 minutes while reminding the sport he's the clear leader in the CBS Sports National Player of the Year race. He's also now the best player on the team that's No. 1 in Sunday morning's updated CBS Sports Top 25 And 1 daily college basketball rankings, because the Blue Devils have moved to the top spot after their massive victory.Michigan is No. 2. Arizona is No. 3. Iowa State is No. 4. Houston is No. 5.Yes, I know Iowa State (at BYU) and Houston (to Arizona) lost on Saturday. But if you've been following the Top 25 And 1 for a while, you likely know that this deep into any season, I mostly care more about bodies of work than anything else, and I still think Iowa State and Houston belong in the top five based on their bodies of work despite losses this weekend. Put another way, if the NCAA Tournament started today, I still think Iowa State and Houston would be seeded above everybody below them in the Top 25 And 1, which is why they're above everybody they're above in the Top 25 And 1.\nSpeaking of, 15 of the 16 teams in Saturday's bracket preview were also in Saturday morning's Top 25 And 1, as I noted with Emily Proud on CBS Sports HQ. The only difference was that on Saturday morning, I had St. John's in my top 16 but did not have Texas Tech, while the selection committee had Texas Tech in its top 16 but omitted St. John's.Top 25 And 1 rankings\n        Biggest Movers\n    \n                4\n            \n                BYU\n            \n                8\n            \n                Vanderbilt\n            RkTeams\n                    ChgRcrd\n                                1\n                            \n                                    Duke\n                                \n                            Cameron Boozer finished with 18 points and 10 rebounds in Saturday's 68-63 win over Michigan.

The maximum in wagering credits that can be accrued is $500, which would require wagering $2,500.   How to bet on horse racing: Most popular types of wagers There are a number of different wagering options available on each race, and here we will go through the three traditional bets – Win, Place and Show – as well as the combinations of each.  Each horse will have different odds for each bet type. These odds let you know what the expected return on that horse will be. It's important to note that the odds on each horse fluctuate throughout the day and payouts are calculated based on the final odds, not the exact odds from the time you place your bet. That is because racebooks use parimutuel wagering.  Differences in horse racing odds vs. sportsbook odds Horse racing odds rely on parimutuel wagering, which is a system that pools together all of the money bet on each market up until the race begins. The track and the books take a certain percentage or rake for their operations (the Takeout), and the remainder of the pool is then divided among the winning ticket holders. The takeout is divided between the house (track) and horsemen, including race purses.   What is particularly unique about this system for those who are accustomed to betting on sports is that your odds can shift after you place the bet until they lock when the race begins. In sports betting, if you bet something at 10-1 and it later moves to 8-1, you still receive the 10-1 payout. In horse racing, your payout will change based on the way the market moves to create the final odds. The final odds you'll be paid out at are determined by how much is bet on each horse and the Takeout.  The standard horse racing unit for win, place, or show bets is $2. Win The win bet is simply betting on which horse will come in first place in the race. Using the 2026 Herbie Dyke Stakes as an example, the winner was Legarto and finished with 12-5 odds. A $2 Win bet paid $6.80, a product of the standard $4.80 for a 12-5 payout on a $2 bet, plus your original $2 wager amount back.  Place The Place bet allows you to wager on whether a horse will finish first or second in a race, meaning two Place bets will pay out on each race. This gives you a greater chance of winning, but lowers your odds on the horse if they place.  Using the 2025 Kentucky Derby as the example again, a $2 Place bet on the No. 18 horse only returned $7.50 compared to the $17.96 for a Win bet. But also, a $2 Place bet on the No. 8 horse (Journalism), who was the favorite but came in second, paid $4.94 while the Win bet lost.   Show The Show bet is an even more conservative betting option, as you are wagering on whether that horse will finish in the top three positions. That means three Show bets will pay out each race. For example, a $2 Show bet on a 10-1 winner returned $4. As you can see, show bet odds are far lower than win bet odds.      Win/Place You can also combine these bets on each horse when you're placing your wagers. That means if you want to bet on a horse to win and place, you can do that. A $2 Win/Place bet really means you're betting $4 – a $2 Win bet and a $2 Place bet. If the horse you bet on wins, you will win both bets. If the horse finishes second, you would only win the Place bet.   Place/Show The same is available for a Place/Show bet, where a $2 Place/Show bet would be $4 wagered on a $2 Place bet and a $2 Show bet. If your horse finishes first or second, you would win both, but if it finishes thir,d you would only win the Show bet.   Win/Place/Show (Across The Board)  Finally, you can bet on all three options in what is often referred to as an Across The Board bet. A $2 Across The Board bet would really be $6 wagered – $2 on Win, $2 on Place, and $2 on Show. If you make an Across The Board bet and your horse wins, you pay out on all three wagers.  It's important to note that betting on Win/Place/Show combinations may not result in a net return even if one of the bets pays. For example, at the 2024 Kentucky Derby, an Across The Board bet on the 11 horse would've returned just $5.58 on $6 wagered.   How to bet on horse racing: Exotics wagering Many horse racing bettors will place exotic bets where they try to predict where multiple horses will finish in a race. These combination wagers offer the chance for bigger payouts, but come with a lower probability of winning (just like same game parlays in sports betting).  It is important to note that, unlike sports betting, there is no standard odds calculation to use for determining exotic payouts. Because of Parimutuel wagering, odds can fluctuate until the race begins, depending on which horses other bettors are backing.   Exactas An exacta bet is picking the two horses that finish first and second in the exact order. Once again using the 2025 Kentucky Derby as an example, a $2 exacta on the No. 18 and No. 8 horses (who closed with final odds of 7-1 and almost 3-1) paid $48.32. Exotics winnings will vary based on the number of horses in the race, the odds of the top-finishing horses, and the size of the pool. For example, the field for the 2024 Kentucky Derby saw a longer shot horse win, so the exacta pool paid $258.56 -- significantly more than the 2025 Derby.   Trifectas This horse racing wager is placing a bet on the exact order of the top-three finishers in a race. A straight trifecta will pay handsomely, but is extremely difficult to hit. Trifecta payouts are often shown for $0.50 bets, but some will show for $1 bets as well. The payout screen will tell you which, but that's important to note so you're aware of how much you are getting back.  The 2025 Kentucky Derby Trifecta paid $231.12 on a $1 Trifecta bet.   Superfectas Superfecta bets try to predict the exact order of the top-four finishers in a horse race. The superfecta payout is usually shown for a $1 bet. For the 2025 Kentucky Derby, a $1 superfecta that added the fourth-place No. 3 horse to the trifecta paid $1,682.27.  Super High 5 Some books will even allow you to bet on the top-five finishers in their exact order in what is called a Super High 5 bet. Those payouts will again be shown for a $1 wager. The odds of hitting a Super High 5, especially in a large field race, are exceptionally low.  The 2025 Kentucky Derby's $1 Super High Five paid $38,405.96.  Box A box bet allows you to have every possible combination for exotics. If you think you know which two horses will hit the exacta but are not sure in what order, you can box it. The same goes for trifectas and superfectas. The more horses you box together, the lower your total profits on the payout will be.  For example, a three-horse exacta box bet costs $12 to bet, as you are betting $2 on all six potential combinations between those three horses: $2 on No. 1 in first, No. 2 in second$2 on No. 2 in first and No. 3 second$2 on No. 3 in first and No. 1 in second$2 on No. 3 in first and No. 2 in second$2 on No. 2 in first and No. 1 in second$2 on No. 1 in first and No. 3 in secondYou can do the same for Trifectas and Superfectas, but at exponentially escalating costs. A $1 Trifecta Box with three horses is six combinations, so $6 wagered: $1 on No. 1 in first, No. 2 in second, No. 3 in third$1 on No. 1 in first, No. 3 in second, No. 2 in first$1 on No. 2 in first, No. 1 in second, No. 3 in third$1 on No. 2 in first, No. 3 in first, No. 1 in second$1 on No. 3 in first, No. 1 in second, No. 2 in third$1 on No. 3 in first, No. 2 in second, No. 1 in firstFrom there, four horses in a $1 trifecta box is 24 combinations for $24 wagered. Five horses is 60 possible combinations for $60.  A $1 Superfecta box of four horses is $24 wagered, five horses is $120 wagered and six horses is $360 wagered.   How to bet on horse racing: Multi-race wagers While those exotics offer a variety of options for betting on individual races, you can also bet on multiple races at the same track in various ways. These combination wagers will pay out based on the betting pool, but they allow you to put together a handful of horses you're confident in throughout the day to increase your potential payout.   Daily Double The Daily Double is what it sounds like: Betting on back-to-back race winners from that day. The odds for Daily Doubles vary based on the odds for the individual horses you bet and the Daily Double betting pool. As an example, the $2 Daily Double at Horseshoe Indianapolis on April 15, 2025 from the first two races with the 7 horse in the first race (went off at 1-1 odds) and the 4 horse in the second race (went off at 3-5 odds) paid $8.  Once the first race ends, the payouts for each potential Daily Double will be shown under a \"Will Pays\" tab on the next race's betting screen.   Pick-3, Pick-4, Pick-5 and Pick-6 Along with the Daily Double, there are more options for betting the winner of multiple races in a row at the same track. The Pick-3 is picking the winner in three consecutive races, the Pick-4 in four consecutive races, and so on for the Pick-5 and Pick-6. Like exotics, the pool amount and the odds for each horse wagered on determine the payouts for these multi-race wagers. The default unit for these bets varies from book to book, with FanDuel showing $0.50 payouts and TwinSpires showing $1 payouts in the Will Pays section.  The more races you put together on a ticket, the more you can win. But as with any multi-race wager, the more legs you add, the harder it is to win.  For some of the biggest races, the Pick-6 will feature a set guaranteed prize pool for the winner(s) no matter what the actual wagered amount is. The 2024 Kentucky Derby featured a $1 million guaranteed pool on TwinSpires for Pick-6s on races 6 through 11 at Churchill Downs.   Understanding horse racing payouts After the race, the winning payouts will be displayed for each bet type at a designated amount. The standard unit for win/place/show and exactas is a $2 bet. Trifectas, superfectas and super high 5s are typically shown as $1 or $0.50, but will say explicitly which on the payout board.  The payouts for each horse in the top three for the 2025 Kentucky Derby looked as follows: 2025 Kentucky DerbyWinPlaceShowSovereignty (No. 18) \t\t\t\t$17.96 \t\t\t\t$7.50 \t\t\t\t$5.58 \t\t\t\tJournalism (No. 8) \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t $4.94 \t\t\t\t$3.70 \t\t\t\tBaeza (No. 21) \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t $8.38 \t\t\t\t If you bet more (or less) than the standard $2 unit, you multiply the payout by how much you bet and divide by the standard unit. For example, a $10 Win bet on Sovereignty returned $89.80, while a $25 Show bet on Journalism would've returned $46.25.  For the single-race exotics at the 2025 Kentucky Derby, the payouts were as follows:  2025 Kentucky DerbyPayout$2 Exacta (18-8) \t\t\t\t$48.32 \t\t\t\t$1 Trifecta (18-8-21) \t\t\t\t$231.12 \t\t\t\t$1 Superfecta (18-8-21-3) \t\t\t\t$1,682.27 \t\t\t\t$1 Super High 5 (18-8-21-3-20) \t\t\t\t$38,405.96 \t\t\t\t Kentucky Derby betting and the Road to the Kentucky Derby The most famous race in horse racing is the Kentucky Derby. How to bet on the Kentucky Derby is the same as any other horse race, with one twist that makes it more unpredictable.  Typically, there are a maximum of 20 horses that will run in the Kentucky Derby. Horses must be nominated and also collect enough points through various qualifying series to get a starting gate. The biggest of those is the Road to the Kentucky Derby qualifying series that begins the year prior and includes events nationwide.  There are 36 races in the primary Road to the Kentucky Derby series in 2026, with two separate prep-race series for international horses leading up to Derby 152. The races scheduled closest to the Derby are part of Championship Season, where horses can earn the most points towards qualification for the coveted Kentucky Derby field.  The Championship Season is headlined by major Grade-1 Stakes races like the Louisiana Derby, Arkansas Derby, Florida Derby and Blue Grass Stakes.  There are also opportunities for horses overseas to qualify through the Euro/Mideast Road to the Kentucky Derby and the Japan Road to the Kentucky Derby, with the winners from each series getting a Derby post position.  Kentucky Derby Future Wagers PoolsIn the months leading up to the Kentucky Derby each year, horse racing betting sites and apps offer access to futures pools for the Kentucky Derby. Unlike in race day wagers, though, if the horse you bet on does not run, your bet is not refunded. In exchange for this risk, players who pinpoint Kentucky Derby starters often get far better odds than on race day. Here is the schedule of Kentucky Derby future wager pools for the 2026 Derby:Pool 1: October 29-31, 2025 CLOSEDPool 2: November 27-30, 2025 CLOSEDPool 3: January 16-18, 2026 CLOSEDPool 4: February 13-15, 2026 CLOSEDPool 5: March 13-15, 2026 (additional Kentucky Oaks future wager pool available)Pool 6: April 2-4, 2026 Each pool closes at 6 p.m. ET on the final day of wagering.  Biggest horse races beyond Kentucky Derby betting The horse racing calendar operates year-round, but there are six events on the schedule that serve as the biggest and feature the largest purses, thus attracting the best fields. The three Triple Crown events headline for the general public, but the Breeders' Cup, Pegasus World Cup and Dubai World Cup all offer massive purses and attract some of the best horses and fields in all of racing. January 24, 2026: Pegasus World CupMarch 28, 2026: Dubai World CupOctober 30-31, 2026: Breeders' Cup  Triple Crown of horse racing The Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes make up horse racing's Triple Crown. There are 13 horses that have completed the Triple Crown, winning all three events, and just two – American Pharoah (2015) and Justified (2018) – have accomplished that feat in the 21st century.  Not every horse competes in all three Triple Crown events, as each race operates at different lengths and the turnaround time can be too quick for trainers to be comfortable running their horse again at the next race. Some Derby winners don't run the Preakness and some have made it two legs before withdrawing from the Belmont.  The Kentucky Derby is a 1 1/4 mile race, the Preakness Stakes is 1 3/16 mile, and the Belmont Stakes is a grueling 1 1/2 mile event (although it is being run currently at 1 1/4 mile at Saratoga Race Course due to renovations at Belmont Park).   Tips and advice for betting on horse racing There are a number of strategies for betting on horse racing, but it all starts with understanding the horses and knowing their strengths, weaknesses and past performances.   Racing forms and past performances These are race-day publications and programs available at tracks and online to preview the day's races at each track, and they are full of data and information from past races. All of the best horse racing betting apps have integrated much of this information into its betting screens for each race.   Track conditions Before you even get to the horses, understanding track conditions is vital. Knowing if a track is dirt or grass, firm and fast or soft and slow, is critical information to know so you can look at which horses in a given race run best in certain conditions.   Horse tendencies  From there, you want to understand the tendencies of horses in the field. Some horses get out to fast starts and try to push the pace, while others hang back and try to make a late kick. If most of the field is expected to push the pace and run it fast, then a horse that prefers to stay back may be at an advantage due to an unsustainable early pace.  The opposite could be true, too; if the pace is going to be slower early, frontrunners are more likely to hold their position. Some of this information can be found in PPs or Past Performance data.   Post position Post position can also matter to a horse's success. Some prefer to run the rail (on the inside of the track) while others prefer being on the outside and having more space. This information is all worth factoring in and comparing with the other horses in the field to determine who you will bet on.  Trainer and jockey information A horse's trainer and jockey will also have tendencies. Some trainers are better at getting horses ready for a certain type of track, but maybe don't have a great track record at others. Some jockeys may be more or less aggressive on the track, which may or may not work well with that specific horse's tendencies, or they may have a long track record with that horse and know how to get the most out of them.   Workout times There's also plenty of data available that can help you. Workout times, if available, can give you an idea of how a horse has been running in training before a big race.   Speed figures Speed figures are like advanced stats of the horse racing world, offering a metric to show how well a horse has been running in its recent races that factors in things like field strength and track quality.  Taking all of that data into account is important to betting on horse racing, and for beginners it's best to ease in and do as much observing as you do betting. You'll start to find certain trends for horses, jockeys, trainers and tracks that can help you find edges on the odds board going forward.  Manage your horse racing betting bankroll Managing your bankroll with what percentage of money you have set aside for horse racing betting is vital to increasing your chances of scoring big at some point. Just like in sports betting, where most bankroll management experts advise no more than 2% of your bankroll should be bet on any given game, the same principle can be applied to any given horse race.   Rules and responsible gaming Responsible gambling is taken very seriously across all racebooks. All provide the necessary resources and contact information if you or someone you know may have a gambling problem. The minimum age is 18 for horse racing betting in most states, but it is 21 in some states. Responsible gambling resources include the National Council for Problem Gambling (NCPG) and Gamblers Anonymous. Be smart. Bet smart. Wager responsibly.

    "body": "\n        College basketball fans will get an absolute treat on Saturday with a rare marquee nonconfrence showdown in the month of February between No. 1 Michigan and No. 3 Duke. After No. 2 Houston lost earlier this week to Iowa State, this game will more than likely determine who is ranked No. 1 in the AP Top 25 poll on Monday and the team that is in the driver's seat for the No. 1 overall seed in next month's NCAA Tournament. Duke and Michigan have combined for just three losses heading into the weekend. Duke lost to Texas Tech back in December and fell on the road earlier this month to in-state rival North Carolina after the Tar Heels hit a go-ahead 3-pointer with 0.4 seconds remaining after trailing the entire game. The Wolverines have won 11 consecutive games since losing to Wisconsin earlier this month. Michigan remains in firm contention to win the Big Ten regular season title. The Wolverines have a 2.0-game lead over Illinois heading into the weekend with just four conference games remaining in the regular season.  \n        \n            \n                Bracketology: Experts predict NCAA Tournament bracket before committee reveals early top 16 seeds\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMeanwhile, Duke is 2.0 games ahead of Virginia in the ACC standings, also with four games remaining. Duke faces Virginia at home next weekend. \nHere is everything you need to know ahead of Duke's matchup with Michigan on Saturday.  Duke vs. Michigan: Need to know  No. 1 overall seed on the line: This game not only has major stakes for next week's AP poll, but also the top line of the NCAA Tournament. The winner of this game will be in the driver's seat to earn the No. 1 overall seed in CBS Sports Bracketology.  No. 3 Duke and No. 1 Michigan are 1-2 in WAB -- a new metric the committee will be looking at -- and the NET rankings. Duke and Michigan are tracking to be placed on opposite sides of the NCAA Tournament bracket, which could make this game a potential national title preview if both teams make it to Indianapolis. Frontcourt is the strength of both teams: Michigan's strength is its frontcourt. The Wolverines have one of the best frontlines in the nation in the trio of Morez Johnson Jr., Yaxel Lendeborg and Aday Mara. Michigan will face its toughest test yet, with a matchup against Duke big man Cameron Boozer, the current national player of the year frontrunner. Boozer has been the most consistent player in the sport. Boozer is a walking double-double. Mara is one of the best shot blockers and defenders in the nation. The key to this one will come down to how Michigan can slow down Boozer. \nGuards will be asked to step up: Yes, the strength of both teams is their frontcourt play, but the guards could also decide this game. On the Michigan front, Elliot Cadeau is familiar with Duke as anyone. He spent the last two seasons at North Carolina before transferring to Michigan last offseason. Cadeau's backcourt mate, Nimari Burnett, is a steady veteran presence. On the other side, Duke guard Isaiah Evans has stepped up and become the clear-cut No. 2 option. There are question marks about Duke's point guard play, with Caleb Foster and Cayden Boozer sharing that responsibility. Boozer has seen his role increase lately. That's a good thing for all parties.  Where to watch Duke vs. Michigan live  Date: Saturday, Feb. 21 | Time: 6:30 p.m. ET Location: Capital One Arena -- Washington, D.C. TV: ESPN | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)   Duke vs. Michigan prediction, pick  \nThis game is a rare nonconference Final Four/national title preview in February. It's truly going to be a toss-up. Duke and Michigan rank 1-2 in adjusted defensive efficiency, per KenPom.com, and are also No. 1 and 2 in most other metrics. The key will be the frontcourt and 3-point shooting. Duke shots 34.9% from the 3-point line, while Michigan knocks down 36.1% from beyond the arc. In a sense, Boozer has become almost underrated because people have just gotten used to how dominant he is. This is an opportunity for him to show everyone why he's a Tier 1 NBA Draft prospect. Duke wins behind Boozer and Evans. Pick: Duke +2.5\n \t \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            UM -2.5\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    STRAIGHT-UP\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    Who will win and cover in every college basketball game? Visit SportsLine to get picks from the model that simulates each game 10,000 times and is up more than $1,200 for $100 players on its top-rated spread picks the past six years. \n            ",

The Hawkeyes' defensive numbers also plummet on the road, where they've allowed 74 or more points in five of seven Big Ten away games.\" Back Wisconsin at DraftKings here:\nCeltics vs. Lakers Over 228.5This game takes place in Los Angeles, and no NBA team has hit the Over at a higher rate at home than the Lakers, with an 18-8 mark. These teams just met a few weeks ago, and that contest went over, despite the Lakers missing the firepower of both LeBron James and Luka Doncic. Meanwhile, Boston has seen each of its last two games surpass the total, as the model forecasts a dozen players scoring more than 9 points. With that, the Over hits 61.8% of the time in an A-rated pick. Back the Over at DraftKings here:Suns (+3.5) vs. Trail BlazersPhoenix is 8-4 against the spread over its last 12 home matchups with Portland, while also outright winning in eight of those 12. This season, the Suns are unparalleled when it comes to spread success as they boast the best ATS record in the league at 35-22. Two of those ATS victories came against Portland earlier this year, and the Blazers are mired in a slump versus the line as of late. They are just 3-6 ATS over their last nine games and are coming off a 54-point defeat to Denver on Friday, which is the second-biggest loss of any NBA team this season. The model has Phoenix covering almost 60% of the time. Back the Suns at DraftKings here:\nWant more NBA and college basketball picks on Sunday?You've seen some of the model's Sunday best bets.

    "body": "\n        Anthony Hernandez will look for the biggest win of his career on Saturday when he faces Sean Strickland in a middleweight clash in the main event of UFC Fight Night from Toyota Center in Houston.Strickland is a former UFC middleweight champion, having scored a shock win over Israel Adesanya at UFC 293. He would go on to drop the title in his next fight, a split decision loss to Dricus du Plessis at UFC 297. Strickland rebounded with a split decision win over Paulo Costa before losing in a championship rematch with du Plessis.Sign up for Paramount+ and WATCH UFC Fight Night LIVE for no additional fee -- every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with your subscription. Plans start as low as $8.99/month or $89.99/year!Hernandez's UFC career got off to a rough start, going 1-2 in his first three fights in the Octagon. He has since rattled off eight wins in a row to climb to the No. 4 spot in the official UFC middleweight rankings, one spot behind Strickland.\nUFC Fight Night also features two perennial contenders looking to protect their places in the pecking order. Geoff Neal (No. 12) battles the tenacious Uros Medic, and Dan Ige (No. 14) tries to snap Melquizael Costa's five-fight win streak. Both veterans approach fight night renewed after overcoming personal health issues. For Neal, a five-year battle with substance abuse. For Ige, eye injuries before the Patricio Pitbull fight. Elsewhere on the undercard, ranked heavyweights are set to collide when Ante Delija and Serghei Spivac face off. Delija is looking to bounce back from a surprising knockout loss to rising contender Waldo Cortes Acosta in November. Prior to that, Delija scored two first-round knockouts in his first two UFC appearances. And an interesting UFC debut is set at welterweight when Josiah Harrell takes on Jacobe Smith. Harrell was scheduled to make his promotional debut at UFC 290 against Jack Della Maddalena, but during his fight week medical screening, doctors discovered he had Moyamoya, a rare brain disease that causes the arteries supplying blood to the brain to become narrowed or blocked. Now, nearly three years later, he gets his chance to make a first impression.Below is all the information you need to catch the action on Saturday night.

Referee Dan Miragliotta leaped in to stop the fight at 4:56 of Round 1 as Costa likely secured a top-15 ranking at 145 pounds. \"I told everybody this week, I just fought a legend,\" Costa said. \"No one has been able to finish him and I said that I was going to do that. I was able to do it.\"After Ige scored an early takedown, Costa quickly scrambled back to his feet and began to wear Ige down in the clinch with knees to the body. From there, Costa showcased his full offensive bag by stunning Ige with a front kick to the face and going to the body with a variety of strikes that led up to the finish.\nCosta extended his win streak that began following a second-round knockout loss to Steve Garcia in 2023. Of his six wins on his current run, four have come by stoppage. After the fight, Costa called out a former two-time featherweight title challenger who was sitting Octagonside. \"There is a guy here that you all love and I love, too,\" Costa said. \"Diego Lopes, let's go at it.\"\nIge, a 34-year-old native of Hawaii, suffered his fifth loss in his last seven fights. \n            \n",

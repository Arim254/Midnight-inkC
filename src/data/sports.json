Kelvin Sampson prides himself on having strong defensive teams, so you can bet practices weren't fun for the Houston players the last few days. Texas Tech actually matches up well with the Cougars. TCU does not. Houston should eat the Horned Frogs alive on the offensive glass, while its ball pressure defense causes havoc against a TCU squad that can be sloppy with the basketball. The Cougars are 6-2 away from home this season and I expect them to bounce back with an emphatic win on Tuesday.\" Back Houston at bet365 here:\nUnder 229 in Heat vs. Magic (-110)Miami is in a good position to put up a strong defensive performance on Wednesday night, as it has not played since Sunday.

    "body": "\nFrom NFL player props to Patriots vs. Seahawks (-4.5, 45.5) picks against the spread, your 2026 Super Bowl parlay can go in a number of different directions. Another option is guessing the margin of victory of the game, and there's an NFL betting trend that could help in that regard. Entering Super Bowl LX, three of the last four editions of The Big Game have been decided by exactly 3 points. So, you could back the game's winning margin to be exactly 3 points in a 2026 Super Bowl SGP, which would return +500.Seattle winning by 3 points has +950 NFL prop odds, while New England doing the same carries +1100 odds. But if you want to increase your potential winnings exponentially, then you could string one of these wagers with others into a lucrative Super Bowl same-game parlay. There are countless 2026 Super Bowl picks with plus-money payouts you can target, from alternate lines to anytime TD scorers to exact score predictions. Before making any Super Bowl 60 picks and NFL parlays, you need to see the epic Super Bowl LX same game parlay from SportsLine's proven model that pays out $15,000 on just a $10 bet.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters the 2026 Super Bowl on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now that the simulation model has had a chance to digest the Super Bowl 60 NFL odds, it's locked in its betting picks to form a longshot NFL parlay that could pay out $15,000 for a $10 bettor. You can only see the picks and full parlay by heading to SportsLine.\nTop 2026 Super Bowl parlay picksFor Super Bowl LX, one of the picks featured in the longshot parlay is Patriots WR Kayshon Boutte as an anytime TD scorer (+310). Despite ranking 68th amongst wideouts in catches (33) in the regular season, Boutte was 18th in positional receiving touchdowns (6). He added another score in the Divisional Round and then got a redzone target in the AFC Title Game. While Seattle has an elite defense, through the air is where to exploit that unit. Eight of the last 10 touchdowns the Seahawks have allowed have been via the pass, including all three they gave up in the NFC Title Game.Boutte has more touchdowns this season than the Pats leading receiver, Stefon Diggs, despite the latter having twice as many targets and receptions. The model projects Boutte to score 0.31 touchdowns, which is the highest amongst all Patriots and brings great value to these plus-money odds as one leg of a Super Bowl SGP. See the rest of the picks in the Super Bowl LX same game parlay here, and you can bet Boutte as an anytime TD scorer using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nHow to make NFL parlay picks for a payout of $15,000The parlay also includes three additional Super Bowl picks from SportsLine's NFL model, including a must-see first NFL touchdown-scorer prop that pays out 25-1.

    "body": "\n        The Pro Football Hall of Fame may as well stitch a \"B\" on every gold jacket it hands out from now until the end of time as a scarlet letter in the aftermath of snubbing Bill Belichick on the first ballot. The bombshell report from ESPN revealing that the legendary head coach, widely considered to be the greatest the NFL has ever seen, was not voted into Canton on the first ballot has rattled the league to its core and has left a permanent stain on the institution. It's bewildering to be in a reality where Belichick is not a first-ballot Hall of Fame inductee, but here we are. Because we live in such a reality, we have to now ask this question: Is Tom Brady next? It's an equally ludicrous thought to consider, but the simple fact is that if it can happen to Belichick, it almost certainly can happen to Brady, the co-pillar to New England's dynasty. Brady retired after the 2023 season, meaning he will first be eligible for the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2028. But will he actually break through? What was once thought to be the most obvious of locks is no longer so obvious. \"I don't understand it,\" Brady told Seattle Sports on Wednesday when asked to react to Belichick's snub. \"I mean, I was with him every day. If he's not a first-ballot Hall of Famer, there's really no coach that should ever be a first-ballot Hall of Famer. ... There's no coach I'd rather play for. If I'm picking one coach, to go out there to win a Super Bowl, give me one season, I'm taking Bill Belichick.\"\n\n                                                                    CBS Sports HQ\n                                                            Let's look at the reported reasons why Belichick won't be enshrined on the first ballot. The reporting from ESPN's Don Van Natta Jr. and Seth Wickersham cites multiple sources that point to New England's pair of cheating scandals -- Spygate and Deflategate -- as key elements as to why Belichick is on the outside looking in. \"The only explanation [for the outcome] was the cheating stuff,\" a veteran Hall voter told ESPN on Tuesday. \"It really bothered some of the guys.\"As it relates to Spygate, Belichick was fined $500,000, while the team was docked a first-round draft pick and fined $250,000 as well. Brady was quarterbacking the New England Patriots over this period of alleged videotaping, but did not specifically receive any sort of punishment. Deflategate, however, is a different story entirely. Brady was at the center of that scandal and ended up serving a four-game suspension. \nWe won't dive into how credible the NFL's findings were over their investigation, the Ideal Gas Law, or The Wells Report in Context. We're merely pointing out that there is ammunition to dock Brady just like there was with Belichick regarding Spygate. The voters decided to use it against Belichick, and it stands to wonder if they'll use it towards Brady once he becomes eligible. At this stage, they'd look tremendously hypocritical if they don't, which further emphasizes how inexcusable and laughable snubbing Belichick was in the first place.  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Bill Belichick won't be the only snub for the Pro Football Hall of Fame's class of 2026. News broke Tuesday that Belichick -- despite winning eight Super Bowls, including six as coach of the New England Patriots -- did not receive enough votes to receive induction into the Hall of Fame during his first year of eligibility. Eli Manning, the quarterback that defeated Belichick's Patriots in two Super Bowls, reportedly isn't getting inducted this summer, either. Manning, who quarterbacked the New York Giants from 2004-19, did not receive enough votes for induction in his second year of eligibility, according to The Athletic. He is one of 15 modern-era finalists that includes fellow quarterback Drew Brees, who is expected to be inducted in his first year of eligibility. While it likely won't have the same viral reaction as Belichick's snub, Manning's exclusion from this year's Hall of Fame class is nonetheless notable. Manning is just one of six players in history to own multiple Super Bowl MVPs. The three Hall of Fame-eligible players from that select fraternity (Joe Montana, Terry Bradshaw and Bart Starr) were inducted in their first year of eligibility. The other two (Tom Brady and Patrick Mahomes) will almost certainly receive the same treatment as soon are they are eligible for induction. \n        \n            \n                Bill Belichick's snub demands a Hall of Fame reckoning\n                \n                    Jonathan Jones                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nManning is one of just two eligible starting quarterbacks with multiple Super Bowl wins that is not in the Hall of Fame. The other is Jim Plunkett, who helped lead the Raiders to upset wins over Philadelphia and Washington in Super Bowls XV and XVIII, respectively. \nManning's detractors often point to his 117-117 regular season record and 60.3% career completion percentage as reasons to keep him out when there are several quarterbacks in the Hall of Fame whose numbers are similar or worse. Joe Namath, for example, went 62-63-4 as a starting quarterback and had 173 career touchdown passes and 220 interceptions. Namath's Hall of Fame bust is mostly due to his role in the greatest upset in NFL history when the New York Jets -- an 18-point underdog -- stunned the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III. Like Namath, Manning also played a key role in one of the biggest upsets in NFL history when he helped the Giants upset the previously undefeated Patriots in Super Bowl XLII. And while Namath didn't throw a single pass during the fourth quarter of his upset win, Manning's fourth quarter against the Patriots included two touchdown passes (including the game-winner) and an iconic completion to David Tyree that immediately became part of Super Bowl lore. \nFour years later, Manning defeated the Patriots again on football's biggest stage. While it is often forgotten, the Giants' win that day was largely the byproduct of a brilliant throw from Manning to Mario Manningham that set up the game-winning touchdown. \nSuper Bowls aside, Manning is one of the greatest playoff quarterbacks of all-time. During the Giants' two Super Bowl runs, Manning led all postseason quarterbacks in attempts, passing yards and touchdown passes. He had one of the greatest playoff runs in league history in 2011 when he completed 65% of his passes for 1,219 yards and nine touchdowns over a four-game span. It's also worth noting that Manning has the third-longest consecutive starts streak in league history behind only Hall of Famer Brett Favre and fellow 2004 draft classmate Philip Rivers. Manning is also 11th all-time in both career passing yards and career touchdown passes. \nDespite those numbers, Manning reportedly did not get enough votes to join his older brother, Peyton, in the Hall of Fame this time around. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Count Tom Brady and Robert Kraft among the swarm of prominent football figures to speak out in dismay after longtime New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick fell short of the voting threshold required for Pro Football Hall of Fame induction. Brady, who won six of his seven Super Bowls under Belichick's tutelage, called the snub from first-ballot induction \"completely ridiculous\" and lamented the selection process after his former coach fell short of the required 40 out of 50 votes.Belichick became Hall of Fame-eligible this year because he has not coached in the NFL since 2023. He will be back up for nomination as part of the 2027 class, but that he missed out on joining the illustrious fraternity in his first year on the ballot left the football world puzzled.\"I don't understand it,\" Brady said during a Seattle Sports radio appearance. \"I was with him every day. If he's not a first-ballot Hall of Famer, there's really no coach that should ever be a first-ballot Hall of Famer. Which is completely ridiculous, because people deserve it. He's incredible. There's no coach I'd rather play for. If I'm taking one coach to go out there to win a Super Bowl, give me one season, I'm taking Bill Belichick. So that's enough said.\"Kraft, the Patriots' owner since 1994, joined Brady in calling into question how Belichick could possibly not make it on his first ballot. Kraft and Belichick ended their tenure working together on icy terms, but Kraft still calls him the \"greatest coach of all time\" and said he should have been a unanimous selection this year.\n\"Whatever perceptions may exist about any personal differences between Bill and me, I strongly believe Bill Belichick's record and body of work speak for themselves,\" Kraft told the Associated Press. \"As head coach of the New England Patriots for more than two decades, he set the standard for on-field excellence, preparation, and sustained success in the free agency and salary cap era of the National Football League. He is the greatest coach of all time and he unequivocally deserves to be a unanimous first-ballot Pro Football Hall of Famer.\"Kraft is also a finalist in the contributor category for the Pro Football Hall of Fame this year, as he hopes to finally get selected after also falling short numerous times due to the various controversies during the Patriots' dynastic run. With Belichick now getting the same treatment, one can't help but wonder if Brady's first time on the ballot will be met with similar resistance. \n        \n            \n                Bill Belichick snubbed by Hall of Fame: We now can't rule out the possibility of Tom Brady meeting same fate\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nFrom an accolades standpoint, there is no justification for voters excluding Belichick from their ballots. He set a head coaching record with six Super Bowl wins and added two more as an assistant, leads all coaches with 12 Super Bowl appearances, ranks second all time with 333 career wins and holds more playoff victories (31) than any coach in league history.\nBelichick's implication in multiple scandals during his Patriots tenure are essentially the only knocks against his résumé and were enough for multiple voters to pass over him as a first-ballot inductee. One voter said to ESPN that the scandals \"really bothered some of the guys.\"\"When it comes down to votes and popularity and all that, welcome to the world of voting,\" Brady said. \"You may as well go try for the Oscars or whatever and get a big panel to tell you if you're good or not. It's the way it works, unfortunately.\"Only four coaches have been enshrined as first-ballot Hall of Famers since 1970. There has been a movement to keep Belichick out of that group because of Spygate and Deflategate, and enough voters shared the sentiment that he ought to wait a year.\nBelichick will almost certainly get into the Hall next year after paying the price for his controversies. But that he has to wait a year and that his legacy will always be slightly tarnished by his lack of first-ballot status raises questions about the validity of the voting process itself.\"He's going to get into the Hall of Fame,\" Brady said. \"In the end, I'm not worried about that. A lot of times in life, for all of us, things don't happen exactly how you want them on your timeline. But we'll all be there to celebrate him when it does happen. He's going to have a huge turnout from so many players, coaches that appreciated everything that he did and the commitment that he made to winning and the impact that he had on all our lives. That will be a great celebration when it happens.\"\n            ",

The former Patriots coach, who won six Super Bowls in New England, was widely expected to be a first-ballot Hall of Famer, but that won't be happening this year. So how did arguably the greatest coach in NFL history get left out? To understand that, you have to break down the voting process, which is a little complicated, so let's walk through it. There are 50 members of the Hall of Fame selection committee. The committee is made up mostly of media members, along with several Hall of Fame coaches, front-office members and players.To be enshrined this year, Belichick needed at least 40 votes.Belichick was competing with four other finalists for a spot in Canton. He was up against the three senior finalists (Ken Anderson, Roger Craig and L.C. Greenwood), along with one contributor finalist (Patriots owner Robert Kraft).Each member of the selection committee is allowed to vote for up to three candidates. Members are not asked to rank them. If a candidate's name appears on a ballot, that counts as a vote.Since Belichick didn't make it, that means he was left off at least 11 ballots.The voting is done in secret, and the Hall of Fame does not disclose how anyone votedBasically, there's no accountability or transparency in the process. CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones has called for the entire system to be blown up. \nThe Hall of Fame has a full list of the 50-person selection committee on its website, and although ballots are supposed to remain secret, several committee members have come out and revealed whether they voted for Belichick. The committee includes one media member from each city that has an NFL team (32 total). There's also one member representing the PFWA, along with 17 at-large voters. Let's take a look at the full list, including members who have publicly said they voted for Belichick, and those who have not revealed their ballots. \nCommittee members who have publicly said they voted for Belichick: Arizona: Kent Somers, retired Arizona RepublicBuffalo: Vic Carucci, WGRZ-TVChicago: Dan Pompei, The AthleticCleveland: Tony Grossi, ESPNCleveland.com/WKNR RadioDetroit: Dave Birkett, Detroit Free PressGreen Bay: Pete Dougherty, Green Bay Press-GazetteHouston: John McClain, SportsRadio610Los Angeles (Chargers): Eric Williams, Sports IllustratedMiami: Armando Salguero, Outkick.comNew York (Giants): Gary Myers, AuthorNew York (Jets): Rich Cimini, ESPN.comPhiladelphia: Paul Domowitch, The33rdTeam.com/PhillyMag.comPittsburgh: Gerry Dulac, Pittsburgh Post-GazetteSeattle: Mike Sando, The AthleticTennessee: Paul Kuharsky, PaulKuharsky.comWashington: Jarrett Bell, USA TODAYPFWA: Calvin Watkins, Dallas Morning NewsAt-Large: Mary Kay-Cabot, Cleveland Plain DealerAt-Large: Jason Cole, FanSided.comAt-Large: Lindsay Jones, The RingerAt-Large: Sal Paolantonio, ESPNAt-Large: Charean Williams, Pro Football TalkCommittee members who have publicly said they did NOT vote for Belichick:Kansas City: Vahe Gregorian, Kansas City StarCommittee members whose votes are unknown:Atlanta: Darryl Ledbetter, Atlanta Journal-ConstitutionCincinnati, Geoff Hobson, Bengals.com Dallas: Rick Gosselin, Talk of Fame NetworkDenver: Jeff Legwold, ESPN/ESPN.comIndianapolis: Mike Chappell, Fox 59/CBS 4Jacksonville: Sam Kouvaris, SamSportsLine.comLas Vegas: Paul Gutierrez, Raiders.com Los Angeles (Rams): Howard Balzer, SiriusXM NFL RadioMinnesota: Mark Craig, The Minneapolis Star-TribuneNew England: Ron Borges, Talk of Fame NetworkNew Orleans: Jeff Duncan, Times-PicayuneSan Francisco: Matt Maiocco, NBC Sports Bay AreaTampa Bay: Ira Kaufman, JoeBucsFan.comAt-Large: Joe Bussert, retired, NFL OfficeAt-Large: Frank Cooney, The Sports XchangeAt-Large: Tony Dungy, NBC Sports \"Football Night in America\" (Hall of Famer)At-Large: Dan Fouts, Broadcaster (Hall of Famer)At-Large: Clark Judge, Talk of Fame NetworkAt-Large: Ross Ketover, NFL FilmsAt-Large: James Lofton, CBS Sports (Hall of Famer)At-Large: Alex Marvez, SiriusXM NFL RadioAt-Large: Bill Polian, SiriusXM NFL Radio (Hall of Famer)At-Large: Lisa Salters, ESPN At-Large: Jim Trotter, retired, The AthleticAt-Large: Barry Wilner, retired, Associated PressCommittee members who won't be revealing their voteCarolina: Darin Gantt, Carolina PanthersBaltimore: Scott Garceau, 105.7 The Fan/WMAR-TVOut of the group of 50, more than 20 members have already come out and said they voted for Belichick.We also know that at least 11 voters did NOT vote for him. Mike Sando of The Athletic outlined how that might have happened: Some voters could have been turned off by the Spygate allegations, while others might have prioritized the senior candidates, who may not make the final ballot next year. It's also possible some voters weren't thrilled with the recent rule change that made former coaches eligible after just one year out of the league. CBS Sports NFL researcher Doug Clawson also came up with some theories about why certain voters might have left Belichick off their ballots. It's not just Spygate -- there was also Deflategate. And let's not forget, the Patriots were fined $1.1 million for filming the Bengals sideline in 2019. \n\n        \n            \n                Bill Belichick snubbed by Hall of Fame: We now can't rule out the possibility of Tom Brady meeting same fate\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThen there's the Bill Polian factor. In a story Tuesday, ESPN reported that Polian tried to convince a few other voters that Belichick deserved to wait at least one year as a punishment for Spygate. The former Colts general manager told Sports Illustrated on Tuesday that he definitely voted for Belichick, but then backtracked later in the night, telling ESPN that he was 95% sure he voted for him. The Hall of Fame vote took place Jan. 13, and if Polian can't remember after just two weeks, that opens up another set of issues. The only committee member who has publicly admitted to leaving Belichick off his ballot is Vahe Gregorian of the Kansas City Star, who wrote an article explaining why he left the the six-time Super Bowl winner off his ballot. \n\"I didn't vote against Belichick or Kraft. I voted for the three senior candidates: Ken Anderson, Roger Craig and L.C. Greenwood,\" Gregorian wrote. As Sando mentioned, there was almost certainly going to be a faction of voters who prioritized getting the senior nominees in and that's what Gregorian did. For the senior nominees, this could be their last shot at making the Hall of Fame and that clearly factored into Gregorian's decision. On the other hand, Belichick will almost certainly be a finalist next year, so Gregorian didn't feel pressed to put him in this year whether he was deserving or not. If other voters went the same route as Gregorian, then Belichick not getting in is less of a snub and more of a flaw in the selection process. And if that's the case, then the Hall will need to think long and hard about the process going forward. \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        A new judge will be assigned to handle Alabama star Charles Bediako's eligibility case after the NCAA's motion to recuse him was granted, ESPN reported on Tuesday, citing court documents. The NCAA filed the motion to recuse James H. Roberts Jr., the Tuscaloosa judge who issued the original temporary restraining order that allowed Bediako to return to the Crimson Tide after he declared for the NBA Draft in 2023 before playing in the G League.Roberts and his wife, Mary Turner Roberts, have been acknowledged by the Crimson Tide Foundation's website as donors to the university with contributions of between $100,000 and $249,999  Despite last playing for Alabama three years ago, Bediako has been a contributor in his first two games after returning.Bediako played 25 minutes and scored 13 points for the Crimson Tide in their loss to Tennessee last weekend in his first game action for the program since 2023. Bediako played on Tuesday against Missouri and finished with 14 points, six rebounds and a steal in 18 minutes during a 90-64 win for the No. 23 Crimson Tide.\nAlabama has a matchup against reigning national champion No. 19 Florida on Sunday.The NCAA's motion requesting Roberts' recusal noted it is not alleging \"an actual bias, partiality, or prejudice.\" However, the NCAA's argument centered on what it contends is an \"an impermissible appearance of impropriety because of the intense media scrutiny and public speculation surrounding the Court's relationship with the University of Alabama and its athletics programs and student-athletes.\"Poll position questionedAlabama dropped six spots in the AP Top 25 poll to No. 23 after falling to Tennessee in Bediako's debut. The presence of Bediako on the floor was an influential factor in at least one voter's slotting of the Crimson Tide. Connor Earegood, who covers Michigan State for the Detroit News, revealed that he did not include Alabama on his ballot because of the Bediako situation.\n\"I will not rank a team that has to circumvent the rules through a court order just to win (and still lost),\" Earegood wrote on X. \"To me, that's a team admitting its own weakness.Bediako doesn't miss a beat in return  Two and a half years after last suiting up for Bama, Bediako looked great in his return, adding a dynamic lob threat to the Crimson Tide's frontcourt.He finished 5-of-6 shooting from the floor -- with four dunks -- and added added three rebounds, two blocks and two steals. It was exactly the type of performance that may make the heartache of doing battle with the NCAA worth it for coach Nate Oats, who thrust his program into the national spotlight in recent days by pushing to get Bediako eligible during the middle of the season.\n\n        \n            \n                Were Alabama fans cheering Charles Bediako -- or the erosion of the NCAA?\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBediako's return to college basketball -- aided by a temporary restraining order issued by a local judge -- after his entry into the 2023 NBA Draft has whipped college basketball into a frenzy. The case is only the latest example of how eligibility standards in college basketball are cratering as the NCAA's rules continue to face legal challenges.He last played for Alabama in the 2022-23 season as a sophomore before remaining in the NBA Draft pool beyond the NCAA's well-established and clearly communicated draft withdrawal deadline. That deadline has long served as a line in the sand for players weighing their futures.Prior to the Bediako fiasco, the precedent maintained by the NCAA was this: if you withdraw before the NBA Draft deadline, you can preserve your collegiate eligibility. If you don't withdraw and choose to remain in the NBA Draft, you are forfeiting your future collegiate eligibility. There was never any ambiguity over that until Bediako found a friendly judge who cleared the path for his return.\n\n        \n            \n                Norlander's Court Report: Charles Bediako's case could crater college hoops; inside Virginia's rapid rise\n                \n                    Matt Norlander                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThrow in the fact that Bediako signed multiple NBA contracts and has been away from college basketball for nearly three years and you get a messy situation that has stoked the ire of coaches around the country.The precedent now being established by the Bediako case could permanently change the enforceability of the draft withdrawal deadline, further eroding the NCAA's ability to govern college basketball. It's also just the latest domino to fall in a saga that has seen the makeup of college basketball rosters continue to change and skew in a more professional direction.While some have likened the case to that of Baylor center James Nnaji, who joined the Bears earlier this season after he was drafted No. 31 overall in the 2023 NBA Draft, there are some key differences.\nA pro career hasn't panned outBediako went undrafted in 2023 and has not played in an NBA game, but he did sign a two-way contract with the Spurs ahead of the 2023-24 season. He's also signed NBA Exhibit 10 deals. Both forms of contracts make him ineligible for college basketball, according to NCAA standards. This is also one key area in which Bediako's case differs from others who have played in the G League before returning to college basketball: Bediako is the first to have been under contract with an NBA organization.Here is an excerpt from the NCAA's statement made by senior vice president of basketball Dan Gavitt:\"Mr. Bediako signed three NBA contracts after competing in college for two seasons. The NCAA has not and will not grant eligibility to any prospective or returning student-athletes who have signed an NBA contract. Eligibility rules ensure high school students get a shot at earning scholarships, and we will continue to consistently apply and defend these rules.\"Charles Bediako was a key player for Alabama for two seasons before declaring for NBA Draft in 2023.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            The case for returning to collegeA key point in Bediako's argument for eligibility is that he is within the NCAA's five-year window for eligibility. The clock started when he enrolled at Alabama as a freshman in the 2021-22 season, and the 2025-26 season marks Year 5 on his clock. Since he's within his five-year window and has yet to play in an NBA game, Bediako's representation argues he should be able to play.\"The NCAA's arbitrary and inconsistent enforcement of its eligibility standards is inflicting immediate and irreparable harm upon him,\" said Bediako's lawyer, Darren Heitner, in a statement. \"This harm is particularly egregious given the NCAA's recent decisions granting eligibility to athletes with far more extensive professional experience, revealing a pattern of selective and inequitable application of its own rules.\"\nDifferences between Bediako and Nnaji casesThe case involving Baylor center James Nnaji differs from the Bediako case because, although Nnaji was drafted in 2023 (the same year Bediako went undrafted), Nnaji never signed an NBA contract. Nnaji was also cleared by the NCAA to play for Baylor, whereas Bediako has not been cleared by the NCAA. Nnaji also never appeared in a college basketball game and thus was never subject to the NCAA's NBA Draft withdrawal deadline. Bediako was subject to that deadline in 2023.A local judge makes decisionThe temporary restraining order granted by judge James Roberts Jr., a Tuscaloosa County Circuit judge, allowed Bediako to play on Saturday. Roberts' decision drew criticism after it was revealed he is listed as a donor to the University of Alabama's athletic department. On Jan. 26, the NCAA filed a motion requesting Roberts' recusal to avoid the appearance of impropriety. \nWhat Oats said about his roster additionAlabama needs help on the interior, and Bediako profiles as a strong rim protector after leading the Crimson Tide in blocks with 1.8 per game in the 2022-23 season. Though Bediako is averaging just 4.9 points, 5.4 rebounds and 0.6 blocks in 15.1 minutes per game for the Motor City Cruise, he size, length and track record of collegiate production could benefit the Crimson Tide. Those attributes were all on display against Tennessee.\"He was here not that long ago, and when he was here, he was an elite rim protector, very good post defender, rebounder, very good lob target,\" Alabama coach Nate Oats said. \"And I think his game's continued to develop, and we'll try to use some of the stuff he's developed. But right now, we're just trying to get him used to playing with the players we have.\"What other coaches are saying about BediakoFlorida coach Todd Golden said \"I don't agree with it, and I don't think he should be playing.\" He also added that he doesn't fault Oats for taking a step that could help his team win games.\n\"We are going to beat them anyway,\" Golden said. \"If he plays, we'll beat them anyways.\"\n        \n            \n                Florida's Todd Golden sounds off on Charles Bediako's potential return to Alabama: 'We'll beat them anyway'\n                \n                    Cody Nagel                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nKentucky coach Mark Pope suggested the NCAA Tournament selection committee should not consider results that occurred when a team played someone who is not eligible under NCAA rules.\"The one stop gap that is kind of spreading right now, that maybe has some legs, is that the NCAA does get to decide who gets to go to the NCAA Tournament,\" Pope said. \"They get to decide that. They have that power. \n\"They've been very, very clear about the rules they're going to try to enforce,\" Pope added. \"They might lose in court, but they still get to decide what games count towards the NCAA Tournament.\"\n            ",

Some people come for the game day snacks and stay for the Super Bowl halftime show, which is historically the most-watched musical performance of the year.The halftime show has been headlined by some of the biggest artists of all time and has brought us wild and iconic moments throughout the 60 year history of the Super Bowl. This year it will be Bad Bunny headlining, taking the stage at Levi's Stadium in Santa, Clara, California on Sunday, February 8. He has yet to announce any special guests, but often the performances have them. Some have speculated that rapper Cardi B, who he has the hit song \"I Like It\" with and is also dating Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs, could join him.The three-time Grammy winner and the most-streamed artist in the world was announced as the headliner earlier this season.Last year during the big game, Kendrick Lamar took the stage in New Orleans. In 2024, Usher took the stage in Las Vegas. In 2023, Rihanna took the stage at State Farm Stadium during Super Bowl LVII. Before that, five performers took the stage for Super Bowl LVI in Los Angeles: Eminem, Dr. Dre. Snoop Dogg, Kendrick Lamar and Mary J. Blige performed halfway through the Rams win over the Bengals. \n\n        \n            \n                Ranking top-10 Super Bowl halftime performances of all-time: Here are the most iconic and memorable moments\n                \n                    Shanna McCarriston                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nFor the artists who play the halftime show at the Super Bowl, they're entertaining an audience that is exponentially bigger than any they've ever encountered. It was not always like that however. So, what were the shows like before they were must-see television? Do you remember that killer halftime show featuring the Rockettes, Chubby Checker and the 88 grand pianos in 1988? Do you remember the captivating \"Be Bop Bamboozled\" at the Orange Bowl in 1989? No, no you do not. Ditto Carol Channing (twice) or any one of those four annoyingly contrived Up With People performances in the late '70s and early '80s.The Super Bowl halftime show, before Michael Jackson, was an endless wasteland of college marching bands and maddening flag-spinning tributes, from salutes to Hollywood (twice), to Motown, to the Big Band Era, to the Caribbean, to Duke Ellington. We also got the New Kids on the Block (1991) not singing any of their biggest hits and Gloria Estefan (1992) providing the soundtrack for Olympic figure skaters Dorothy Hamill and Brian Boitano of \"What would Brian Boitano do?\" fame, because nothing says a Minnesota Super Bowl like the lead singer of the Miami Sound Machine.Then we got the King of Pop at the Rose Bowl in 1993 -- and the Super Bowl halftime show was never the same again.\nHere is the complete list of previous Super Bowl halftime performers and themes:2026: Bad Bunny2025: Kendrick Lamar with special guest SZA2024: Usher with special guests Alicia Keys, Jermaine Dupri, H.E.R., will.i.am, Lil Jon, Ludacris2023: Rihanna2022: Eminem, Dr. Dre.

    "body": "\n        Rapper Cardi B is from the Bronx and this season the New York native finds herself rooting for her hometown team's rival. Cardi B began dating New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs last spring and has since become a prominent character in Patriots Nation.Another prominent character is quarterback Drake Maye's wife, Ann Michael Maye, who has quickly become a fan favorite. She went viral by baking sweet treats and recording her recipes over the holidays in a series she called \"Bakemas.\" Patriots Nation flocks to her comment section to show their affection for who they call the queen of New England. Fans point out her humble nature, great game day outfits and appreciate her love story with No. 10, who she has dated since they were in middle school.While Ann Michael has been a Patriots fan for the last two years, since her husband was drafted No. 3 overall in 2024, Cardi B is newer to the scene. The rapper frequented Patriots games this season, often spotted with team owner Robert Kraft. She also consistently takes to social media to show her support for the Super Bowl bound squad, live tweeting games and posting videos. Cardi B does the team's signature touchdown dance, especially when Diggs has a big play, and is very vocal with her newfound fandom, shouting out the team any chance she gets.\nOne of the games she attended this season was the team's AFC Championship Game at Mile High in Denver, Colorado. The Patriots defeated the Broncos, 10-7, in a snowy defense-heavy showdown. With her Birkin in hand and an AFC Champion hat, Cardi took to the field after the game and her excitement was palpable.\nYelling the team's phrase \"We all we got, we all we need,\" and taking interviews with on-field reporters, she discussed how much Diggs has worked to come back from an ACL injury and get to this point.\"That's what I'm talking about! We're going to the Super Bowl. Oh my God,\" she said after the team secured a ticket to their 10th Super Bowl in franchise history.\nThere is little doubt that she will be at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California when the Patriots take on the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday, February 8. \nDespite being from New York, Cardi has also mentioned being a Boston Red Sox fan. Cardi B and Stefon Diggs' timelineThe two were spotted in May of 2025 and then became Instagram official in April.Cardi B announced that she was pregnant with her fourth child, and first with Diggs, on September 17, 2025 and announced the birth of their son on November 4, 2025. The rapper has three other children, two daughters and one son, with her ex-husband and fellow rapper Offset.\n\n\nDiggs has two different children with two women and reportedly became the father to four other children, including Cardi B's, in 2025. Cardi B's careerCardi B is not just one of the most successful female rappers of all time, she is one of the most successful rappers of any gender. She has the most number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100 for a female rapper. She is the only female rapper to have multiple solo number one hits. She first came on the scene in of 2015 when she became a cast member on Love and Hip Hop: New York. Her first major record label contract was in February of 2017 with Atlantic Records and a few months later was nominated for Best New Artist and Best Female Hip-Hop Artist at the BET Hip Hop Awards.\nIn June of 2017 her debut single \"Bodak Yellow\" became her breakout hit, peaking at No. 1 and becoming the first female rapper to have a solo No. 1 since Lauryn Hill in 1998. The song put her on the map, became certified Diamond, earned her two Grammy nominations and was single of the Year at the BET Hip Hop Awards.Her nexts hits, \"No Limit\" and \"MotorSport\" were collaborations and also made history, making her the first female rapper to have three songs in the top 10 of the Hot 100.Cardi B's other hits include \"I Like It,\" \"Girls Like You,\" \"Finesse\" and \"Be Careful.\" Her latest album \"Am I the Drama?\" dropped in 2025. Over her career she's been nominated for 264 awards and has 165 total wins.\nShe made her film debut in Hustlers in 2019.Super Bowl halftime show performance?Bad Bunny is set to headline the Super Bowl LX halftime show and even before the Patriots made it, Cardi B was one of the names in the conversation of special guests for the performance. Cardi B and Bad Bunny have worked together in the past on the song \"I Like It\" with J Balvin. Many fans are now hoping a Patriots Super Bowl appearance will increase Cardi's chances of joining on stage, though she may want to focus on being a fan rather than having to work.Cardi B is on the performers list for the 68th Grammy Awards, broadcasting on CBS on Sunday, February 1. Diggs won't be joining her on the red carpet, since he'll be busy preparing for the biggest game of his life, but maybe Cardi will drop some hints about whether she will be a performer at the Super Bowl as well.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        This marks the third year we've ranked \"ghost rosters\" at CBS Sports, and the No. 1 spot is finally going to someone other than Texas Tech. Illinois is your 2025-26 ghost roster champion, as the Illini boast college basketball's strongest contingent of former players.The Illini's continent of former players still active elsewhere in Division I is deep and provides a good mix of guard play, wing prowess and size on the interior. North Carolina isn't far behind. Both Illinois (Morez Johnson) and UNC (Elliot Cadeau) have sent players to Michigan, where they are thriving for one of the top national title contenders. When evaluating a ghost roster, we take quantity — not just quality — into consideration. As a result, you won't see teams like Belmont featured. The Bruins have some former stars like Ja'Kobi Gillespie (Tennessee), Cade Tyson (Minnesota) and Malik Dia (Ole Miss) doing big things elsewhere now. But the contingent of ex-Bruins gets shallow quickly beyond those three.The same is true for Oklahoma, which boasts a ghost roster featuring star guards Milos Uzan (Houston), Otega Oweh (Kentucky) and Duke Miles (Vanderbilt). But the Sooners wouldn't have much of a frontcourt and therefore fail to make the top 10.\n\n        \n            \n                College basketball rankings: Why Nebraska may have more believers after Cornhuskers' close loss at Michigan\n                \n                    Gary Parrish                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSo, in summary, we are ranking the programs that could field the most competitive teams consisting exclusively of their former players who are still playing college basketball. A special congrats to Kevin Overton of Auburn and Desmond Claude of Washington who appear on multiple ghost rosters this year.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. IllinoisIllinois is doing just fine without these guys, and these guys are doing just fine without Illinois. Dra Gibbs-Lawhorn has transformed from a Big Ten role player into one of the Mountain West's most productive guards at UNLV. Tre White is having the best year of his winding career at Kansas following a one-year stint in Champaign. Morez Johnson is now a key cog in Michigan's machine after a promising freshman season at Illinois. Sometimes a breakup works out great for both parties, and Illinois' ghost roster is a good example.Dra Gibbs-Lawhorn | UNLV | 6-1 | PG17.6 PPG | 2.8 APG | 35.5% 3PTSkyy Clark | UCLA | 6-3 | PG13.5 PG | 2.3 APG | 1.3 SPGTre White | Kansas | 6-7 | SF14.9 PPG | 7.3 RPG | 43.0% 3PTMorez Johnson | Michigan | 6-9 | PF13.7 PPG | 6.9 RPG | 68.7% FGAmani Hansberry | Virginia Tech | 6-8 | C15.3 PPG | 8.6 RPG | 2.8 APG Jayden Epps | Mississippi State | 6-2 | SG15.2 PPG | 2.6 RPG | 41.8% FGAdam Miller | Gonzaga | 6-3 | SG7.3 PPG | 33.3% 3PT | 0.8 APGCarey Booth | Colorado State | 6-10 | PF10.9 PPG | 6.3 RPG | 56.7% FGNiccolo Moretti | FAU | 6-1 | PG4.0 PPG | 3.0 APG | 1.6 RPG\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. North CarolinaIf North Carolina fans are shocked watching Cade Tyson morph into one of the nation's premier shooting forwards, you can't blame them. His one-year experiment with the Tar Heels was a disaster. All it took was another change of scenery for the former Belmont star to discover the sort of high-major acumen that UNC was seeking from him last season. \nElliot Cadeau has also blossomed since leaving Chapel Hill and is facilitating the offense for a juggernaut Michigan squad. Tyler Nickel and Ven-Allen Lubin are long gone, but they are putting together nice seasons for projected NCAA Tournament teams. This team would be a little short on guard depth, but it's strong.Elliot Cadeau | Michigan | 6-1 | PG10.3 PPG | 5.2 APG | 41.6% 3PTIan Jackson | St. John's | 6-4 | PG10.8 PPG | 36.4% 3PT | 1.3 APGCade Tyson | Minnesota | 6-7 | SF20.1 PPG | 40.0% 3PT | 5.5 RPGTyler Nickel | Vanderbilt | 6-7 | PF14.7 PPG | 46.3% 3PT | 3.3 RPGVen-Allen Lubin | NC State | 6-8 | C13.4 PPG | 6.9 RPG | 66.9% FGJalen Washington | Vanderbilt | 6-10 | C9.6 PPG | 5.4 RPG | 1.4 BPGJames Okonkwo | Utah | 6-8 | C2.6 PPG | 5.4 RPG | 56.3% FG\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. DrakeWhen you have three coaches in three years, chances are you'll end up with a decent ghost roster. Such is the case for Drake, which lost 2025 Missouri Valley Player of the Year Bennett Stirtz and a handful of other key players to Iowa when the Hawkeyes hired Ben McCollum. They also lost two-time MVC POTY Tucker DeVries to West Virginia (and now Indiana) when coach Darian DeVries left in 2024. If this ghost roster were an actual team, it would be a little short on interior heft. But it's a strong collection of talent and production.Bennett Stirtz | Iowa | 6-4 | PG18.3 PPG | 5.0 APG | 1.4 SPGKevin Overton | Auburn | 6-5 | SG12.1 PPG | 3.4 RPG | 1.6 SPGTucker DeVries | Indiana | 6-7 | SF14.6 PPG | 5.0 RPG | 3.0 APGTavion Banks | Iowa | 6-7 | SF10.6 PPG | 4.4 RPG | 56.0% FGCam Manyawu | Iowa | 6-9 | C7.4 PPG | 4.5 RPG | 64.0% FGColby Garland | San Jose State | 6-1 | PG18.4 PPG | 4.2 APG | 1.1 SPGIsaia Howard | Iowa | 6-6 | SG6.6 PPG | 3.1 RPG | 1.2 SPGKael Combs | Iowa | 6-4 | PG6.3 PPG | 2.7 APG | 51.2% FGConor Enright | Indiana | 6-0 | PG4.5 PPG | 4.1 APG | 3.3 RPG\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. AlabamaPerhaps if Alabama had worked to retain some of the heft on its ghost roster, its real roster would be in better shape. Instead, the Crimson Tide had to hit up G Leaguer Charles Bediako nearly three years after he turned pro. Jarin Stevenson, Derrion Reid and Mo Dioubate all departed after last season. Any of them would have been useful for Nate Oats this season. \nThe top three guards on this list are all major contributors to good teams.

XavierXavier's ghost roster is headlined by high-producing performers at big-time brands like Louisville (Ryan Conwell) and Texas (Dailyn Swain). But it's lowkey got some pop throughout the college basketball landscape.

USCNobody turns over a roster quite like Eric Musselman, who was working the portal before it was popular. As a result – and because of the natural attrition associated with the coaching transition from Andy Enfield to Musselman after the 2023-24 season – the Trojans have a solid ghost roster. Malik Thomas is one of the ACC's top snipers at Virginia, Rashaun Agee is bringing toughness and production to Texas A&M and Oziyah Sellers is a mainstay in the lineup for a St. John's team that is one of the best in the Big East.

New MexicoNew Mexico's ghost roster isn't the deepest, but it's got starpower at the top. Toppin is a potential first-team All-American, and Donovan Dent is starting to find a rhythm at UCLA after ranking as the No. 4 transfer in the 2025 cycle at 247Sports. Filip Borovicanin and Jovan Milicevic followed coach Richard Pitino to Xavier and are playing big roles for the Musketeers.

UCFA complete roster overhaul appears to have been exactly what UCF needed, as the Knights are on track for their first NCAA Tournament bid since 2019. Still, it's hard not to raise an eyebrow at the production coming from the ex-UCF contingent.

When you're paying to keep Christian Anderson and JT Toppin, it's tough to find the money and the touches for players like Darrion Williams and Kevin Overton.

    "body": "\n        A roster purge happens every NFL offseason because long-term contracts aren't fully guaranteed. Players are often released when salaries aren't deemed to match production.Trades can occur for a variety of reasons. Sometimes, a Pro Bowl-caliber player wants a change of scenery. A new regime might look to move high-priced veterans who aren't a good scheme fit. A majority of the time when a player is traded, released or retires, there is a residual salary cap charge. This cap charge for a player who is no longer on a team's roster is commonly referred to as dead money. It exists because the remaining proration of the salary components that are treated like signing bonus immediately accelerate into his team's current salary cap with a trade, release or retirement. Dead money is typically a sunk cost where money isn't owed to a player. Only if there are salary guarantees when a player is released will there be a payment associated with dead money.There are two major exceptions to this general rule of bonus proration accelerating. Only the current year's proration counts toward the salary cap with transactions occurring after June 1. The bonus proration in future contract years is delayed until the next league year beginning in the following March.\nA team can also release two players each league year prior to June 1 (known as a post-June 1 designation) that will be treated under the salary cap as if they were released after June 1. With a post-June 1 designation, a team is required to carry the player's full cap number until June 2 even though he is no longer a part of the roster. The player's salary comes off the books at that time unless it is guaranteed. Post-June 1 designations do not apply to trades.Here's a look at 15 noteworthy players who could be in different uniforms next season because of a trade or as salary cap casualties. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Tua Tagovailoa, QB, Dolphins(With use of post-June 1 designation)2026 salary cap number: $56,267,6472026 compensation: $55 million2026 dead money: $67.4 million (includes $54 million 2026 base salary guarantee)2026 salary cap savings: $11,132,353 cap increaseIt's not a matter of if but when the Dolphins part ways with Tagovailoa. After being demoted to third-string quarterback by former Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel after 14 games, Tagovailoa is ready for a change of scenery. The new regime of general manager Jon-Eric Sullivan and head coach Jeff Hafley will probably go in a different direction at quarterback next season. \nA trade seems highly unlikely because of Tagovailoa's contract. Out of the $55 million he is scheduled to make in 2026, $54 million is fully guaranteed. On the third day of the 2026 league year (March 13), $3 million of Tagovailoa's $31 million 2027 base salary becomes fully guaranteed. The Dolphins guaranteed $20 million of this $31 million for injury when Tagovailoa signed his four-year, $212.4 million contract extension in July 2024.Since there will be $99.2 million of dead money for releasing Tagovailoa, using a post-June 1 designation will be required to let him go in 2026. The $99.2 million would be a record for dead money relating to a single player contract. If the Dolphins follow the blueprint the Denver Broncos used when releasing Russell Wilson in 2024, the necessary $15 million payment to pick an option for a dummy/voiding 2030 contract year will be declined keeping Tagovailoa's 2026 base salary at a fully guaranteed $54 million instead of dropping to a fully guaranteed $39 million. The $67.4 million in 2026 cap charges for Tagovailoa would shatter Wilson's record of $53 million in dead money relating to an individual player in one league year.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Kyler Murray, QB, Cardinals(Assumes a trade)2026 salary cap number: $52,660,6772026 compensation: $42,542,5002026 dead money: $15,629,3542026 salary cap savings: $37,031,323The Cardinals are expected to part ways with Murray this offseason. Murray was effectively benched for Jacoby Brissett, a journeyman backup quarterback, prior to going on injured reserve in Week 10 with the right foot sprain suffered five games into the 2025 season. Arizona's offense operated more efficiently with Brissett at the helm.\nArizona's chance of trading Murray got a shot in the arm when University of Oregon quarterback Dante Moore decided to stay in school instead of turning pro. Moore was projected to be a top five pick in the 2026 NFL Draft.Murray's situation will come to head before March 15 (i.e., the fifth day of the 2026 league year). That's when Murray's completely unsecured $19.5 million 2027 base salary is fully guaranteed. The Cardinals may have to eat part of Murray's $42,542,500 2026 salary, of which $39.835 million is fully guaranteed, to trade him. Doing so would increase Arizona's dead money by such amount. If a trade doesn't materialize, the Cardinals would have $52,429,354 in dead money by cutting Murray without a post-June 1 designation before the 2027 salary guarantee vests.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Kirk Cousins, QB, Falcons(With use of post-June 1 designation)2026 salary cap number: $24.6 million2026 compensation: $12.1 million2026 dead money: $22.5 million (includes $10 million 2026 roster bonus guarantee)2026 salary cap savings: $2.1 millionCousins' contract was reworked as the end of the 2025 regular season was approaching to pave the way for his release with a post-June 1 designation. His $35 million 2026 base salary was cut to $2.1 million freeing up $32.9 million of 2026 cap space. Cousins' 2027 base salary was raised by $32.9 million to $67.9 million and becomes fully guaranteed on the third day of the 2026 league year (March 13). By NFL collective bargaining agreement rules, use of a post-June 1 designation is prohibited when there are contract modifications after the end of the previous regular season.\nNew Falcons head coach Kevin Stefanski's history with Cousins doesn't change his planned release. Stefanski was Cousins' quarterback coach and offensive coordinator during the first two seasons he played with the Minnesota Vikings. Anytime this type of contract maneuver has been made in the past (Alshon Jeffery, Javon Hargrave, Michael Thomas, Marcus Williams, etc.) a post-June 1 designation has been used to release the player.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    A.J Brown, WR, Eagles(Assumes trade only after June 1)2026 salary cap number: $23,393,4962026 compensation: $29 million2026 dead money: $21,793,4962026 salary cap savings: $1.65 million ($5.49 million cap credit in 2027)Brown's frustration with Philadelphia's offense, especially when he has a lack of touches, was a constant part of the equation this season. Eagles general manager Howie Roseman downplayed the notion of trading Brown during his end-of-season press conference. The Eagles are still trying to find a new offensive coordinator. That decision could have an impact on what happens with Brown.The Eagles have an affinity for structuring contracts with multiple option bonuses. This choice creates more bonus proration than with other contract structures. Option bonuses are prorated over the life of contract for a maximum of five years just like signing bonuses. Although the Eagles are comfortable with having significant amounts of dead money each year, trading Brown before June 2 would add $27,161,609 to their 2026 salary cap obligations with the bonus proration from his 2027 through 2029 contracts accelerating forward. \nRegardless of the timing of a 2026 trade, the Eagles would be getting a $5.49 million cap credit in 2027 because an option for the dummy/voiding 2031 contract year wouldn't be picked up and the associated $27.45 million payment (i.e. option bonus) wouldn't be made. This type of thing is occurring with the 49ers in 2026 because of trading Deebo Samuel to the Commanders without exercising an option in 2025 for a future voiding contract year.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Maxx Crosby, EDGE, Raiders(Assumes trade)2026 salary cap number: $35,791,2502026 compensation: $30.782 million2026 dead money: $5,101,2502026 salary cap savings: $30.69 millionCrosby was reportedly evaluating his future with the Raiders after vehemently opposing being shut down for the season due to a knee injury ahead of Week 17's game against the New York Giants. In order for a trade to occur, Crosby will likely have to force Raiders owner Mark Davis' hand. The Raiders briefly made Crosby the NFL's highest-paid non-quarterback last March with a three-year, $106.5 million contract extension, averaging $35.5 million, although he had two years remaining on his existing contract. The deal has $91.5 million in guarantees, of which $62.5 million was fully guaranteed at signing. There are four years worth $116.058 million left on Crosby's contract.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Tyreek Hill, WR, Dolphins2026 salary cap number: $51,134,0442026 compensation: $36 million2026 dead money: $28,248,7502026 salary cap savings: $22,885,294Hill's $51,134,044 2026 cap number was untenable before a gruesome left knee injury in a Week 4 game against the New York Jets. He reportedly dislocated his knee and tore multiple knee ligaments. Hill will surely be released by the third day of the 2026 league year on March 13. That's when Hill has a $5 million roster bonus due and $11 million of his unsecured $29.9 million 2026 base salary becomes fully guaranteed.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Geno Smith, QB, Raiders2026 salary cap number: $26.5 million2026 compensation: $26.5 million2026 dead money: $18.5 million (comes from $18.5 million 2026 base salary guarantee)2026 salary cap savings: $8 millionThe Raiders dealt a 2025 third-round pick to the Seattle Seahawks for Smith last March to provide quarterback stability after having six players start at quarterback since releasing Derek Carr following the 2022 season. Shortly after the trade, Smith was given a two-year, $75 million contract extension, averaging $37.5 million per year with $50.5 million in guarantees, where $42.5 million was fully guaranteed at signing. Incentives and salary escalators made the deal worth as much as $84 million.Smith didn't resemble the player who was named 2022's NFL Comeback Player of the Year this season. He led the NFL with 19 interceptions. Smith's 84.7 passing rating was 30th in the NFL.The Raiders are expected to select Indiana University Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Fernando Mendoza after securing the first overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft because of a 3-14 record. It's hard to imagine Smith having a trade market given his disappointing season. Expect a resolution with Smith prior to the third day of the 2026 league year on March 13 when the remaining $8 million of the $26.5 million 2026 base salary becomes fully guaranteed. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Brandon Aiyuk, WR, 49ers(With use of post-June 1 designation)2026 salary cap number: $14,640,2812026 compensation: $27 million2026 dead money: $13,325,2812026 salary cap savings: $1.315 million ($4.987 million cap credit in 2027)Aiyuk's situation is one of the most bizarre in the salary cap era. The 49ers voided the $27 million of 2026 salary guarantees from the four-year, $120 million contract extension Aiyuk signed at the end of August 2024 because of him missing meetings and declining to participate in other team activities. This occurred while Aiyuk was rehabbing his torn ACL, MCL and meniscus in his right knee he suffered seven games into the 2024 season. Aiyuk never returned to action for the 49ers this season. Instead, Aiyuk was placed on the reserve/left squad list in December after going AWOL. Niners general manager John Lynch confirmed last week that Aiyuk won't be with the team in 2026. The 2026 salary cap savings are minimal because the $4.987 million of 2026 bonus proration from the $24.935 million payment (i.e., option bonus) required to pick up a dummy/voiding 2030 contract year won't be made. The 49ers will get a salary cap credit in 2027 from this $4.987 million.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Marlon Humphrey, CB, Ravens(With use of post-June 1 designation)2026 salary cap number: $26.276 million2026 compensation: $19.25 million2026 dead money: $7.026 million2026 salary cap savings: $19.25 millionHumphrey had a surprising regression this season after earning first-team All-Pro honors with a career-high six interceptions in 2024. He was on the wrong end of too many big plays this season. According to Pro Football Focus, the 916 yards Humphrey allowed in coverage were the most in his nine-year NFL career.

Lattimore was given the benefit of the doubt for his subpar play in 2024 because of a hamstring injury that limited him to five games, including the playoffs, after the Commanders acquired him. He never regained the form that led to four Pro Bowl berths with the Saints before tearing the ACL in his left knee nine games into the season.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    T.J.

Fields' preseason struggles were dismissed instead of being seen as a warning sign after he played well against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the regular-season opener. It was downhill for the 2021 first-round pick after the Steelers game. Fields had a dubious distinction in a Week 6 loss to the Broncos. He was sacked nine times in producing a franchise-worst minus-10 net passing yards. Fields was benched nine games into the season.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    L'Jarius Sneed, CB, Titans2026 salary cap number: $19,557,6472026 compensation: $16 million2026 dead money: $8,115,2942026 salary cap savings: $11,442,353The Titans acquired Sneed from the Kansas City Chiefs, who had designated him as a franchise player, in March 2024 for a 2025 third-round pick with the teams also swapping 2024 seventh-round picks. Sneed signed a four-year, $76.4 million contract, averaging $19.1 million per year with $55 million in guarantees, in the process.The Titans thought they were getting a shutdown cornerback in Sneed but that hasn't been the case. Opposing quarterbacks had a 137.7 passer rating when targeting Sneed, who allowed 17.2 yards per reception, this season according to PFF. Availability has been as big of an issue as Sneed's performance. Sneed has only played 12 of a possible 34 regular-season games since signing because of quadriceps injuries.The fifth day of the 2026 league year, which is March 15, has some significance for the Titans with Sneed. That's when $7.5 million of his $15.15 million 2026 base salary is fully guaranteed. Out of this $15.15 million, $11 million was guaranteed for injury at signing. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Elgton Jenkins, C, Packers2026 salary cap number: $24,329,4122026 compensation: $20 million2026 dead money: $4.8 million2026 salary cap savings: $19,529,412Jenkins moving to center from left guard didn't go as the Packers envisioned before he was sidelined by a lower left leg fracture in November. He was better at left guard than as a center. Jenkins missed most of the offseason activities in 2025 because he wasn't happy with his contract. Any lingering bitterness about the contract could lead to Jenkins' exit.

Scottie Scheffler, who won his 2026 season debut at The American Express, isn't playing this week, opening up the field a bit for big names such as Xander Schueffele, Ludvig Aberg and Patrick Cantlay. Schauffele, the highest-ranked player in the field at No. 6 in the OWGR, is the +1300 favorite in the latest 2026 Farmers Insurance Open odds from FanDuel Sportsbook. Aberg is close behind at +1700, followed by Cantlay at +1900 and Cameron Young at +2000.Five-time major winner Brooks Koepka is a +6000 longshot as he makes his PGA Tour return after recently leaving LIV Golf.

He's a golfer to fade this week. Kim is off to a hot start this season with a T11 at the Sony Open and a T6 at The American Express last week. He was in the final group on Sunday before before a fourth-round 72. This event has been a struggle for Kim, however, as he has no top-10 finishes in eight tries and has missed the cut twice in his last appearances at this tournament. See who else to fade here. \nAnother surprise: The model calls Cantlay one of the best betting values this week. He's a golfer to target if you're looking for a big return. He finished T13 at The American Express with four sub-70 rounds. The California native doesn't have a great track record at this event, but he did shoot a first-round 65 last year at Torrey Pines before struggling over the weekend.

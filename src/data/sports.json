    "body": "\n        By the time the buzzer sounded in Phoenix on Friday night and the Las Vegas Aces sealed their WNBA Finals sweep over the Phoenix Mercury to win their third championship in four years, there was no doubt who would be named Finals MVP.It was A'ja Wilson's trophy, given at the culmination of A'ja Wilson's season, smack dab in the middle of the A'ja Wilson era of women's basketball. It is hard to have a true GOAT conversation while a player is in the prime of their career, but it's certainly clear you can't start that conversation without mentioning Wilson -- and it feels inevitable that one day soon her name it going to end it, too.But there will be time for those debates, short as they may be. For now I feel confident saying this: This was the most impressive season of her already HOF-worthy career. And it's not because led the league in points (23.4), blocks (2.3) and efficiency (29.2), was second in rebounds (10.2) and fourth in steals (1.6). Or because she led the Aces on a 16-game winning streak to close out the regular season. Or because she won the MVP award last month, passing Lisa Leslie, Lauren Jackson and Sheryl Swoopes to become the first four-time MVP in WNBA history. Or because she averaged 26.5 points, 10.1 rebounds, 3.3 assists, 2.5 blocks and 2.1 steals per game this postseason, career highs in every category except rebounds. Or because she hit one of the most iconic game-winning shots in Finals history on Wednesday night to put the Aces up 3-0 in the series. Or because she became the first player in the WNBA or NBA to win the scoring title, MVP, Defensive Player of the Year and Finals MVP in the same year.Sure, those things count. But what really set her season apart was her leadership.\nI'm not the only one saying this. Las Vegas head coach Becky Hammon praised Wilson's leadership before the MVP presentation last month, recalling that during the \"embarrassing moments\" this season, Wilson started taking her teammates aside one by one and pouring into them. \"This is the result of all the work that you don't get to see,\" Hammon said. \"You know, she's just a tireless worker, and where she took us this year from where we were -- if there was a leadership trophy, you know, this is the MVP skills trophy, but she has led tremendously through some really rough waters.\"All championship teams talk about their struggles in dramatically wrought terms. But Hammon and the Aces aren't exaggerating when recalling their low points in 2025. The Aces spent the first few months of the season teetering around the .500 mark, and things hit rock bottom on Aug. 2 when they lost by 53 points at home to the Minnesota Lynx to drop to 14-14. At that point, Napheesa Collier was the runaway favorite for MVP, too.\nESPN's Michael Voepel reported that after that 53-point loss, Wilson sent her teammates a text that set the tone for the rest of the season: \"If you weren't embarrassed from yesterday, then don't come into this gym. You're not needed or wanted here. We need the mindset to shift, because that was embarrassing.\"But she didn't just address them as a group and digitally; she found a way to speak the truth to each of them and bring out the best of them in the process.According to point guard Chelsea Gray, in the first half of the season Wilson told her bluntly, \"There's no way I should ever have more assists than you.\" As reported by ESPN's Katie Barnes, before that remark, Gray was averaging just 4.3 assists per game; the rest of the season Gray averaged 7.1 assists per game. This postseason Gray averaged 7.5 assists per game, a career high for the 32-year-old point guard who now has four WNBA championships to her name – three with Wilson and the Aces, and one from 2016 with the Los Angeles Sparks.\nIt says a lot about Wilson's character not only that she was willing to call out one of the best point guards in WNBA history, but that she had built up enough trust and clout with Gray over the years for Gray to truly listen to her and not just get defensive.And it says even more that she seems to have that level of trust and clout with every member of the team. Twenty-five-year-old forward NaLyssa Smith was traded to the Aces from the Dallas Wings midseason. She had never played with Wilson before, but had long been a fan -- cameras caught Wilson giving Smith advice and encouragement on the court during a preseason game at the start of the year when the two were still on opposing teams.Wilson immediately took Smith under her wing after the trade, helping her adapt to the team by giving her tips, motivating her throughout the game and making sure she stayed mentally focused. That investment paid off. Smith played some of the best basketball of her career this summer and played a key role in the Aces' turnaround.\nBut in my opinion, the most impressive display of her leadership came in a video shared by the Aces' social media team after Wilson won her MVP award. In the video, Wilson was surprised by hand-written notes of congratulations from each of her teammates. She sobbed as she read each and every one out loud -- and after listening to them all, I don't blame her.One by one, her teammates showered words of praise at Wilson, words that go far beyond generic teammate talk.\"I remember last year, you mentioned how you wanted to be a better leader in your last press conference. I just wanted to tell you that you're the best leader I've ever had, and I'm so blessed to compete with you,\" Dana Evans, a reserve point guard in her first season with the Aces, wrote.\n\"People can talk all day about what you are as a basketball player, because you're the best. But I want to tell you how much you mean to people as a human,\" Kierstan Bell, who just finished her fourth year with the Aces, said. \"You show up every single day and make it known that you will run through a wall for the people you love, which is why there's no doubt if I would ever do the same for you.\"Megan Gustafson added that Wilson is \"truly one of the best leaders I've ever witnessed. When you go, we go.\" Kia Stokes wrote, \"You are the definition of a humble superstar, a leader by example, and someone who is selfless.\" Jewell Loyd said, \"To be your teammate is a privilege, but to be your friend is a blessing. The way you serve and show up for your people is a testament to your character.\" Jackie Young wrote, \"I thank you for challenging me to get out of my shell and always believing in me and cussing me out when I needed it.\" Cheyenne Parker-Tyus, who gave birth to her second child this season, said, \"The way you carry yourself is truly top tier, and I pray that my daughter has the same amount of love, strength and greatness that you show every day as a true leader and a champion.\"And Smith shone light on why exactly Wilson's leadership is so effective: \"The kind of person you are, the kind of leader you are makes me want to go harder every day, not just for myself, but because my favorite player believes in me. ... I thank you every day from the bottom of my heart for being the person you are to me and helping me love basketball again.\"\nEven more moving than the words themselves was Wilson's reaction to each name that she read and each compliment she absorbed. Her obsession and adoration for each of her teammates was palpable through the screen.\"This team, oh, man, I would never get tired of talking about this team and my teammates. They are, they're my heartbeat, they're my heartstrings. They are the reason why I love coming into work every single day, and I'm just so appreciative to be able to call them my teammates, my sisters, my road dogs, my partner, anything in between. I'm blessed. I'm really blessed,\" she said.It's not unusual to see stars get along with teammates, or gush about them in big moments. But to see a superstar at Wilson's level have such a genuine connection with her entire roster, top to bottom, is truly rare. Ultimately, that's what sets Wilson apart from everyone else. Her greatness comes with accountability, not dramatics. Her confidence lifts people up, it doesn't tear people down. She knows how important she is to her team and to the game as a whole, but seems to truly believe that everyone in her orbit has the same import. \nThis season put Wilson to the test like no other. And she didn't just pass, she made sure everyone around her did, too. That belongs on her GOAT resume, too. \n            "

    "body": "\n        Week 7 of the college football season is packed to the brim with intriguing matchups, as 17 of the top 18 teams in the AP Top 25 poll will be in action. With most teams set to play their sixth game, Saturday marks the unofficial halfway mark of the 2025 regular season.       Given the surprises we've had so far this season, gear up for another whirlwind day of impactful results. Three games between top 20 teams are on the docket, and several more highly ranked squads face significant conference challenges.       You can bet college football games this week at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:The Big Ten schedule is particularly strong, starting with No. 1 Ohio State traveling to No. 17 Illinois in the early window.. The Buckeyes have established themselves as the clear betting favorite to win the national title, but the Illini could present some resistance.Headlining the day's action is a top-10 tilt on CBS, as No. 3 Oregon hosts No. 7 Indiana in an afternoon clash between two fiery head coaches and a couple of Heisman contenders at quarterback. Capping off the league's strong slate is a critical clash between one-loss teams, as No. 15 Michigan travels to USC. It's also a pivotal day in the SEC highlighted by a couple of rivalry showdowns.       As kickoff approaches, here are the CBS Sports expert picks for the weekend's top matchups.              No. 1 Ohio State at No. 17 Illinois       \nNoon on Fox, fubo (try for free): Unstoppable force, meet immovable object. This game is all about whether Illinois' offense can be the first team to find any kind of success against Ohio State. The Fighting Illini have only had one game go under this 51.5-point total, while the Buckeyes have only gone over that mark once. If you trust coordinator Matt Patricia to keep his defense humming at its unfathomable level, the under is the play. If you trust Illinois QB Luke Altmyer to find the end zone a time or two, over. One of those two wavered once this season -- Illinois scored just 10 points against Indiana -- while the other is as steady as they come, so I lean toward the Buckeyes controlling this and keeping it on the lower-scoring side. Pick: Under 51.5 -- Carter Bahns             \t \t \t \t \t \t \t       \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n

Missouri      \nNoon on ABC, fubo (try for free): Alabama has struggled to score more than four touchdowns in its games against mid- to upper-tier power programs, which is fine, particularly with the defense playing so much better of late. Missouri loves to run the ball, ranking third nationally, and leads the nation in time of possession. The Tigers scored 29 in their only SEC game this season. The Tide rank No. 1 in turnover margin, which could make for a lower-scoring game for the explosive Tigers. Picking a winner is difficult, especially with a 3.5-point spread in favor of Alabama, so we'll go with the point total (51.5) and side with the teams sliding just under.  Pick: Under 51.5 -- Brandon

aggressive in addressing the offensive line this offseason, a response that came from how the Hoosiers looked against the likes of Ohio State and Notre Dame. That, plus the addition of Fernando Mendoza at a time when he's playing great football, has really given Indiana's offense a boost that will be needed to score against a quality Oregon defense. Getting stops against Dante Moore at home will be another concern, for sure, but getting the offense going is the part that seems the most important for hanging around in Eugene.  Pick: Indiana +7.5

He threw five interceptions at LSU and managed just 61 yards at Miami. Elko, defensive coordinator Jay Bateman and the 12th Man are more than capable of making life difficult on him in a similar fashion even with Wilson breaking out as a potential game-changer in the Gators' receiving corps. On the flip side, Florida boasts the best defense Texas A&M has seen all year. The threat of a defensive touchdown always looms, and 47.5 is not a very large number, but I have a hard time believing these offenses will put the ball in the end zone seven times. Pick: Under 47.5

I really like what Michigan has done with its running game and Bryce Underwood is one of the best young quarterbacks in college football. USC has one of the best wide receiver duos in the sport, and that may ultimately make the difference in this one. This is a pivotal moment for Riley's tenure at USC because last year, against Michigan, his team fell short. A win over the Wolverines would change the narrative and would be one of his most impressive wins since leaving Oklahoma. This game will come down to the wire, but USC will walk away with a huge win. Pick: USC -2.5 -- Cameron Salerno \t \n                    \n    \n                                            \n

    "body": "\n        DENTON, Texas -- No. 24 South Florida made its marquee road trip to North Texas awfully difficult ... at least for a half. The Mean Green brought out all the stops. They sold out DATCU Stadium for the first time in program history -- on a high school football Friday night, no less. North Texas coach Eric Morris brought out some trickery and misdirection on key plays to build an early lead, especially as USF turned it over three times in the first quarter alone. But it's nothing fancy or offensive wizardry from coach Alex Golesh that got the Bulls back on top in a 63-36 win to take control of the American Conference. It was old fashioned bully ball. During a 5-minute stretch between the second and third quarter, South Florida showed the physicality that separates it from the rest of the Group of Five. The Bulls recovered a muffed punt and used the threat of a run to set up a pop pass for a touchdown. Then, they marched down the field with ease against an exhausted North Texas defense on the first drive of the second half in 69 seconds using tempo. \nNorth Texas quarterback Drew Mestemaker was electric in the first half, but the walls started to close in as the Bulls' defensive line got home. He whiffed on six consecutive passes in the middle-eight, including two interceptions. When he finally completed a pass, Simeon Evans fumbled the ball after he got smacked by Jarvis Lee, and the ball was returned by South Florida for a touchdown. In only 3:27 of game time, a 21-14 North Texas lead flipped to a 42-21 South Florida lead and the rout was on. Outside of that one sequence, the teams were largely equal. But even on a day where the Bulls did not bring their best football, their physicality gives them an advantage that could carry them perhaps all the way to the College Football Playoff. \"We're playing very physically,\" quarterback Byrum Brown said. \"You can just feel when our offensive line is feeling it. We were getting their D-Line pushed back 3 yards a pop. Them just leaning on opponents has been huge for our offense.\"\nOn one of South Florida's first plays, quarterback Byrum Brown dropped back in the pocket and didn't see blitzing defensive back Quinton Hammonds. The ball dropped out of his hand, but Brown barely moved from the direct hit. UNT was able to mitigate some of the issues against its defensive line with a quick passing game, but soon, defensive tackle Jacob Merrifield and nose guard Traevon Mitchell each got home. That level of team strength was forged over the last year after the Bulls limped out to a disappointing 7-6 campaign. The defense surrendered 104 points over their final four games against lackluster competition and proved unable to push even Tulsa and Rice off their spots. South Florida boasts perhaps the top NIL budget in the conference in 2025, sources told CBS Sports ... and they put it to good use. \nThe Bulls added six defensive line and edge players via the transfer portal and now have a level of size and depth that few in the Group of Five can match. Four defensive tackles on the depth chart weigh more than 280 pounds, including former SEC transfers Devin Lee and Josh Celiscar. \"Like any program, we totally understand that you win games in the trenches,\" Golesh said. \"We needed to get some help and we were very, very picky with who we got. It's a really cool group, and the leadership from those guys has been incredible. Man, you talk about affecting a quarterback, I think we did that.\" South Florida was able to create plenty of disruptive plays in 2025, but what's changed the most for this team is consistency. Against North Texas, it surrendered only 97 yards on the ground on 29 carries, good enough for 3.3 yards per carry. South Florida rushed for 298 yards. Perhaps more descriptively, USF's success rate was in the 95th percentile. North Texas's offensive rate sat in the 34th percentile. \nThis has been more than a blip for South Florida during a 5-1 start. The Bulls pummeled Boise State, holding them to 3.2 yards per carry. They kept the chains moving in an 18-16 win against Florida, averaging 4.4 yards per carry. They have controlled games against some of the best in college football. \"I told these guys last night, we have done nothing easy up to this point,\" Golesh said. \"We took the bye week and had the hardest practice we've ever had. We've attacked, we've practiced really hard.\"After beating North Texas in a blowout, the schedule starts to clear up. There's a tough test against No. 23 Memphis on Oct. 25 that will all but clinch a spot in the American Championship Game, but even a loss there could push them through. With the overall strength of the American behind South Florida, Memphis, North Texas and Tulane, it will give them a chance to earn a trip to the postseason.\n            "

    "body": "\nQuarterback injuries throw everything for a loop in the NFL, and that's certainly been the case in the early stages of 2025. That remains the case for Week 6, but signal-callers aren't the only big injuries worth monitoring this weekend. If you're interested in NFL betting, you need to be aware of who's in and who's out before you place any Week 6 bets of your own.Here, we break down the biggest NFL injuries to know for all of the Week 6 games on Sunday and Monday, including where lines currently stand, according to the latest SportsLine consensus odds, which uses the latest data and odds from top sportsbooks. This post will be updated as official inactives lists are announced before kickoff. Denver Broncos vs. New York Jets (9:30 a.m. ET, in London)No notable injuries\nThe Broncos have stayed largely healthy in the early stages of 2025, and the Jets have really just dealt with Justin Fields' concussion, which is a thing of the past. These two AFC foes meet in London as the NFL is in Europe for the third week in a row, and Denver is a 7.5-point favorite, according to SportsLine consensus odds, while the total is 43.5.Seattle Seahawks at Jacksonville Jaguars (1 p.m. ET)SEA CB Devon Witherspoon (knee, doubtful)SEA S Julian Love (hamstring, doubtful)SEA CB Riq Woolen (concussion, doubtful)SEA DE Derick Hall (oblique, out)\nA Seahawks defense that started the year out well but faltered due to injuries last week will again be tested with notable absences. Edge rusher Derick Hall is out, and three of Seattle's five starting defensive backs -- Devon Witherspoon, Julian Love and Riq Woolen -- are doubtful to suit up against a Jaguars team that's 4-1 and already matched its win total from last year. The Seahawks are slight favorites on the road at -1.5, and the total is 47.5.Los Angeles Chargers at Miami Dolphins (1 p.m. ET)LAC OT Joe Alt (ankle, out)LAC WR Quentin Johnston (hamstring, questionable)\nThe Chargers lost their top left tackle before the season, and 2024 rookie standout Joe Alt has been banged up this year and will miss Week 6 with an ankle injury. The Chargers are looking to get back in the win column after consecutive losses, and they may also be without receiver Quentin Johnston, as he's questionable. Johnston has enjoyed a breakout 2025 to date with 377 yards and four touchdown receptions.Los Angeles is a 4.5-point favorite on Sunday with the total set at 43.5.Los Angeles Rams at Baltimore Ravens (1 p.m. ET)BAL QB Lamar Jackson (hamstring, out)BAL WR Zay Flowers (shoulder, questionable)\nThe Ravens will again be without star quarterback Lamar Jackson as the speedy signal-caller is sidelined with a hamstring injury he suffered two weeks ago. Additionally, top receiver Zay Flowers is questionable. Cooper Rush will start at quarterback again for Baltimore, which is 1-4 and faces one of the top NFC teams in the Rams, who enter Week 6 relatively healthy.The Rams are big 7.5-point favorites on the road against the beat-up Ravens, and the total is 44.5. Arizona Cardinals at Indianapolis Colts (1 p.m. ET)AZ QB Kyler Murray (foot, questionable)\nThe biggest question here for the scuffling Cardinals is whether star quarterback Kyler Murray will suit up. He's officially questionable due to a foot injury that caused him to miss both some snaps last weekend as well as practice time this week. If Murray can't go, Jacoby Brissett will start.The red-hot Colts are 7-point favorites at home here, with the total sitting at 47.Dallas Cowboys at Carolina Panthers (1 p.m. ET)DAL WR CeeDee Lamb (ankle, out)DAL CB Trevon Diggs (knee, questionable)DAL CB DaRon Bland (shoulder, questionable)CAR RB Chuba Hubbard (calf, out)\nThe Cowboys will have to wait at least one more week for CeeDee Lamb to return as the star receiver is once again out with an ankle injury. That's a tough blow for Dallas, especially as Carolina has had one of the NFL's worst defenses since the start of 2024. And speaking of defenses, Dallas may be without both its starting cornerbacks, as both DaRon Bland and Trevon Diggs are questionable.The Panthers will be without starting running back Chuba Hubbard for the second week in a row when they face a porous Cowboys defense on Sunday. The good news for Carolina is Hubbard's backup, Rico Dowdle, was up to the task last week with 206 rushing yards and a touchdown against Miami, and he faces his former team this time around.Dallas is a 3-point favorite at Carolina, and the total is 49.5 as neither team has a defense that has done much to stop opposing offenses. New England Patriots at New Orleans Saints (1 p.m. ET)NO RB Alvin Kamara (ankle, questionable)NE CB Christian Gonzalez (hamstring, questionable)NO RB Antonio Gibson (knee, out)\nThe Saints' offense may be tested this weekend with Alvin Kamara officially questionable. Kamara has 283 rushing yards and is also a key part of the passing game with 17 receptions. If he's out, Kendre Miller would likely serve as New Orleans' lead back.The Patriots have tried a few hands at running back to begin the year, especially with Rhamondre Stevenson's fumbling issues, but Antonio Gibson, who saw an uptick in snaps of late, is out for the year with a knee injury. Stevenson and rookie TreVeyon Henderson will likely split touches once again moving forward. On defense, New England's top player, cornerback Christian Gonzalez, continues to have an injury-filled 2025 as he's questionable with a hamstring injury, which could open the door for New Orleans' passing attack. New England is a 3.5-point favorite on the road, and the total is 46.Cleveland Browns at Pittsburgh Steelers (1 p.m. ET)PITT CB Jalen Ramsey (hamstring, questionable)PITT RB Jaylen Warren (knee, will play)\nThe bad news for the Steelers is star cornerback Jalen Ramsey is questionable for this matchup, which is good news for the Browns and rookie quarterback Dillon Gabriel. The good news for Pittsburgh, however, is Jaylen Warren, who served as the team's lead back in the early stages of the year, is off the injury report after missing the Steelers' win over the Vikings in London two weeks ago.Pittsburgh is favored by 5.5 points and the total is 38.5.Tennessee Titans at Las Vegas Raiders (4:05 p.m. ET)LV TE Brock Bowers (knee, out)\nThe Raiders have lost four in a row, so perhaps a date with the 1-4 Titans is just what Pete Carroll's team needs here. They'll have to do without star tight end Brock Bowers, who is out for the second week in a row. What should help Geno Smith and the Raiders' passing attack is tight end Michael Mayer, who was also out last week, is active.The Raiders are favored by 4.5 points here, with the total sitting at 41.5.San Francisco 49ers at Tampa Bay Buccaneers (4:25 p.m. ET)SF QB Brock Purdy (toe, out)SF QB Mac Jones (knee and oblique, questionable)SF WR Ricky Pearsall (knee, out)TB RB Bucky Irving (foot and shoulder, out)TB WR Mike Evans (hamstring, out)TB WR Chris Godwin (fibula, out)\nIt's very likely another week of the Mac Jones Show as Brock Purdy is out once again with a toe injury. The 49ers starter has played just twice this year, while Jones has gone 3-0 filling in for the Pro Bowler. The issue? Jones is also hurting, as he's questionable with oblique and knee injuries. If Jones can't go, Adrian Martinez would start. Regardless of who starts, they won't be throwing to 2024 first-round pick Ricky Pearsall, who is out with a knee injury.The Bucs just dropped 38 points on Seattle, but the offense remains fairly beat up. In addition to Mike Evans being out once again, Chris Godwin is out after making his season debut two weeks ago after a devastating ankle/leg injury early last year. The Bucs will also be without star running back Bucky Irving for the second week in a row, opening the door for Rachaad White.The Buccaneers enter the weekend favored by 3, and the total for this big NFC tilt is 47.5.Cincinnati Bengals at Green Bay Packers (4:25 p.m. ET)CIN WR Ja'Marr Chase (illness, questionable)GB WR Christian Watson (knee, out)GB OL Zach Tom (oblique and back, questionable)GB OL Aaron Banks (groin and knee, questionable)GB OL Rasheed Walker (quad, questionable)\nThe biggest injury news is on the Cincy side as all-world receiver Ja'Marr Chase was added to the injury report Friday as he's dealing with an illness. Chase is questionable to suit up, and his status is worth monitoring as he's a key to any chance the Bengals have of beating the Packers, especially with a new quarterback in Joe Flacco now under center. The Packers won't activate Christian Watson this week as the speedy receiver recovers from a knee injury. The Packers' O-line is hurting right now, with three starters all questionable for Sunday.The Packers are big 14.5-point favorites for Sunday, and the over/under is 44.5.Detroit Lions at Kansas City Chiefs (8:20 p.m. ET)DET S Brian Branch (ankle, questionable)DET S Kerby Joseph (knee, questionable)DET CB Terrion Arnold (shoulder, out)DET OT Taylor Decker (shoulder, questionable)\nThese teams are in very different shape health-wise entering Sunday Night Football. The Chiefs have no players listed on their final injury report, while the Lions have 10, including three starting defensive backs, one of whom has already been ruled out. Left tackle Taylor Decker is also questionable after missing last week.The Chiefs are 2.5-point favorites over the 4-1 Lions. The total is 52.5.Buffalo Bills at Atlanta Falcons (7:15 p.m. ET, Monday)ATL WR Darnell Mooney (hamstring, TBD)\nBoth sides have some nicks and bruises here, but the biggest name who may miss this game is Falcons receiver Darnell Mooney, who is battling a hamstring injury. Mooney has just seven catches for 79 yards this year after having 992 yards last year when he served as Atlanta's No. 2 option behind Drake London in the passing game.The Bills are favored by 4.5 points in Atlanta after suffering their first loss of 2025. The total is 50. Since this game is on Monday, official injury designations will be announced Saturday. Chicago Bears at Washington Commanders (8:15 p.m. ET, Monday)WASH WR Terry McLaurin (calf, TBD)WASH WR Deebo Samuel (heel, TBD)\nThe Commanders got Jayden Daniels back after he missed two weeks with a knee injury, but it's unclear if his top target, Terry McLaurin, will play Monday as he's been sidelined with a calf injury. Deebo Samuel missed his share of practice last week with a heel injury but played on Sunday, so it's likely he'll play Monday after missing practice Friday.Washington enters the weekend favored by 4.5 points. The total is up to 49.5. Since this game is on Monday, official injury designations will be announced Saturday.   \n            "

This is the week, and I'm excited to use him in a lot of DFS lineups on DraftKings and FanDuel.His price is excellent on both sites since he's $6,600 on DraftKings and $6,000 on FanDuel. And his matchup against the Cowboys is amazing.Dallas is No. 1 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing receivers. And in the past four games against the Cowboys, six receivers have scored at least 15.2 PPR points, including one in each week, with 10 touchdowns over that span.I'm expecting that trend to continue in Week 6, and McMillan has at least eight targets in every game this season. McMillan is poised to dominate in this game.\nFor more of my DFS plays for Week 6, click on this link to SportsLine For more of my DFS plays for Week 6, click on this link to SportsLine.

The teams dismissed the suit with prejudice, permanently ending the legal dispute. The case was initially set to be settled this summer, nearly two years after the Knicks filed the suit in August 2023.\"The Knicks and [Raptors owner] Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment withdrew their respective claims and the matter is resolved,\" team spokespersons said to ESPN. \"The Parties are focused on the future.\"The Knicks alleged in the 2023 lawsuit that the Raptors recruited Ikechukwu Azotam -- who worked as the Knicks' assistant video coordinator -- and ordered him to send them confidential material including play frequency reports, a prep book for the 2022-23 season, video scouting files and opposition research. The team sought $10 million in damages.\n\n        \n            \n                Knicks offense already looks more dynamic under Mike Brown, which could make Jalen Brunson's life a lot easier\n                \n                    Colin Ward-Henninger                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Knicks alleged that the Raptors, who had recently hired coach Darko Rajaković, \"conspired to use Azotam's position as a current Knicks insider to funnel proprietary information to the Raptors to help them organize, plan, and structure the new coaching and video operations staff.\"The Raptors in October 2023 filed a motion to dismiss, argued that the claims were \"baseless\" and said the information was publicly available to all NBA members. They asked NBA commissioner Adam Silver to step in, and a U.S. District Court judge ruled last year, to the Knicks' chagrin, that Silver should resolve the dispute. He was set to oversee the settlement in an arbitration meeting in July.\nIt is a rare occurrence for NBA teams to sue one another. The only other known case came in 1977 when the Knicks were involved in a dispute with the Nets. They claimed that the Nets' attempted move from Long Island to New Jersey infringed on their territorial rights, and the Nets sued and claimed the Knicks were violating antitrust laws. The NBA and state of New Jersey settled the dispute, and the Nets paid the Knicks $4 million for the right to move.\n            \n    "

Xander Bogaerts received a fine as well.Soon after the Game 3 loss at Wrigley Field, video emerged of Bogaerts and Iglesias berating home plate umpire D.J. Reyburn as he exited the field. The confrontation was heated enough that Iglesias had to be held back.\nThe confrontation likely stems from a called strike against Bogaerts in the ninth inning of the Game 3 loss. With the Padres down 3-1, Bogaerts took a down and away fastball in a 3-2 count that was called strike three. Rather than reach base with zero outs and bring the tying run to the plate, Bogaerts struck out. Here's the pitch:\nThe pitch was inside Statcast's generic strike zone, which is not adjusted for player height. The ABS challenge system, which will take effect next season, will be adjusted for every player's height. Baseball America found the pitch was below the adjusted zone and would have been overturned upon a replay. Reyburn made a bad call.Iglesias, 36 in January, will be a free agent this offseason. Unless the one-game suspension is overturned on appeal, he will have to serve it next season with whatever team he signs this winter. After hitting .229/.298/.294 this year and not signing with San Diego until after spring training opened, it's not certain Iglesias will find a new team this winter.\nThe Padres went 90-72 this season and were the NL's second wild card team. They were eliminated by the Cubs in the double-elimination Game 3.\n            \n    "

Backup quarterback Mac Jones is listed as questionable (oblique/knee), but CBS Sports senior reporter Matt Zenitz reports he will get the start for Sunday's battle between two 4-1 teams.Zenitz is also reporting that Purdy, despite Jones' strong play, will reprise his role as San Francisco's starter when he is healthy enough to do so. The 49ers are 3-0 this season in games started by Jones, a former Patriots first-round pick who currently leads the NFL with an average of 301.7 passing yards per game. He's been playing in relief of Purdy, who aggravated his toe injury during the 49ers' Week 4 loss to the Jaguars. Purdy initially sustained the injury during the 49ers' Week 1 win over the Seahawks. \n        \n            \n                NFL Week 6 picks and score predictions: Lions stun Chiefs, 49ers upset Buccaneers in NFC showdown\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWith Purdy out, Jones threw for 279 yards and three scores in the 49ers' Week 2 win over the Saints before throwing for 284 yards with a touchdown and a pick in San Francisco's Week 3 victory over the Cardinals. \nJones returned to the bench for Week 4, and while Purdy threw for 309 yards and two touchdowns, he also turned the ball over three times in a 26-21 loss to the Jaguars. With Purdy back on the mend, Jones returned to the starting lineup last Thursday night against the Rams. In what was arguably his best NFL performance so far, Jones lit up the Rams to the tune of 342 yards and two touchdowns on 33 of 49 passing. Jones was 5 of 6 passing in overtime while helping set up the 49ers' game-winning field goal. \nWhile Purdy is still the 49ers' longterm starting quarterback, Jones will get another chance to show what he can do this week. Sunday could be another big game for Jones, as the Buccaneers' defense is currently 20th in the NFL in passing yards allowed, 24th in touchdown passes allowed and are 29th in the league in red zone efficiency. \n            \n    "

    "body": "\n        AUSTIN, Texas -- The day before the U.S. men's national team's friendly against Ecuador, head coach Mauricio Pochettino wasted no time reminding everyone that his focus for the time being is performance rather than results. He got a game that encapsulated that exact sentiment on Friday night at Q2 Stadium, where the USMNT came from behind and settled for a 1-1 draw, showcasing some genuine signs of progress and lending credence to Pochettino's idea that the team is, at long last, trending in the right direction.Pochettino's first year in the job was marked by unimpressive -- and at times, uninspiring -- results, but as he celebrates a year in the role, the USMNT have traded a sense of doom and gloom for some downright normalcy. In some sense, they were merely the latest victims of Ecuador's egregiously defensive approach that saw them finish second in CONMEBOL's World Cup qualifying competition despite scoring just 14 goals in 18 games, the 35-year-old (or ageless) Enner Valencia nicking a goal from a quick counterattack before the half-hour mark. The U.S. team were not exactly perfect throughout, the midfield trio of Weston McKennie, Tanner Tessman and Aidan Morris not always clicking after months away from a group with a new look, while the hosts were a little bit wasteful in attack as the game continued. None of the USMNT's issues on Friday evening, though, seemed atypical of a team that still has eight months to go before the opening game of the World Cup.As Pochettino marks his first anniversary, the stamp he is beginning to leave on the team is clear and was on full display against Ecuador. While a newfound competitiveness for playing time was apparent from the moment the roster dropped last week, Pochettino's version of the USMNT has a tactical flexibility that the previous iteration under his predecessor Gregg Berhalter did not. The back three he debuted in last month's friendlies against South Korea and Japan returned against Ecuador, this time with some new tweaks -- or specifically, a different look in and out of possession.\"I think we keep, now, playing the way that we plan to play,\" Pochettino said after the match. \"I think we defend with a back four, two midfielders and three and one and of course, the 'keeper -- 1-4-2-3-1 -- but then our formation building from [the] back, we [were] building with three, two and then five.\"\nThe personnel choices were equally as intriguing, with Miles Robinson joining mainstays Chris Richards and Tim Ream at center back while Max Arfsten and Tim Weah balanced each other out in respective roles on the left and right flanks. Weah described his role pre-match as the one of the \"fake wingback,\" simply explaining afterward that \"I would be doing less defending 'cause Miles was covering the whole time so that was pretty much it and in the attack, I was playing like a normal winger.\" Pochettino noted how Arfsten, a more traditional fullback, and Weah's distinct styles added new layers to Friday's game plan.\"That is about hav[ing] different dimensions but that change depends on, also, the position of how we want to attack, how we want to use the channels, how we want to be vigilant if [the opponents] play with one striker, two strikers,\" Pochettino said.\"That is really important and we start to see how [to] change the set-up depend[ing] on the height [of the defensive line] of the opposition -- low block, medium block -- or when you are in the opposite half, different situations can happen. My appreciation, my opinion on his performance is that I think he did well. He did well when he was a winger trying to go in the diagonal to try to create chances. He had a few shots from the outside of the box and then when he was like a wingback because, [Pervis] Estupinan first and then when [Yaimar] Medina [was switched] in, to force him to defend a little bit closer than Miles and then close to [substitute] Alex Freeman.\"There was still a mixed bag element from the USMNT, the team openly admitting that they could have turned more of their 11 shots into clear-cut opportunities. That said, there was a clear idea at play. Each time the USMNT had the ball -- which was often in a game in which they had nearly 65% possession -- the emphasis was to attack as quickly and cohesively as possible. Their attacking outing was also impressive in its own right considering the circumstances -- Sebastian Beccacece's Ecuador conceded just five goals in 18 World Cup qualification matches and it is not all that hard to envision a reality in which a more clinical USMNT would have scored multiple goals against them. Even if a draw is a fair enough result for both sides, the game started to tilt in the U.S.' favor in the second half.\n\"We started to look the fresher team as the game wore on and listen, as someone who's been on the other side of that, you know and you smell that,\" Ream said. \"You're like, okay, these guys … are starting to be a little bit gassed and you actually feel more energized and it allows you to get on top of them more and start making more little plays, being connected better. I think we were connected pretty well in the first half but even closer connections in the second half and I'll tell you what, it takes a toll on teams and it did that today.\"This version of the team felt incomplete in part because Christian Pulisic, Antonee Robinson and Tyler Adams were not in the starting lineup for varying reasons -- Pulisic came on as a substitute and Robinson is not fully fit yet, while Adams did not make the trip as he and his wife await the birth of their second child. None of this comes as a surprise at this point and there are still questions to be answered about what the USMNT is capable of if those players are not on the field, especially Adams. The puzzle pieces feel like they are starting to finally come together, though, with a handful of standout individual performances headlined by Malik Tillman, who continued to prove his worth as one of Pochettino's breakouts with the assist to the USMNT's second-half goal. The credit for that, in the end, went to Folarin Balogun, who has two goals and one assist in his three games under Pochettino so far, reasserting himself once again as Pochettino's go-to No. 9.The normalcy of the moment was not lost on Pochettino, either.\"I think the performance was a very, very serious performance, very professional,\" he said. \"I think what works the most is that we are here talking about actions, concepts, formations, things like this that for me, after one year, I am so, so, so happy that we don't talk about other things like commitment, attitude or things that normally in the past we were talking [about]. I think that this is a massive step up because I think we need to forget that always, win or lose, it depends [on] our performance. If we are better and [if] we make sure we are better than our opponent, we can win. If we don't show that, it's because it's a soccer problem, not [that] it's another problem that is dangerous when these types of things happen in a team.\"\n            "

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Imagn Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Dallas Cowboys running back Miles Sanders will miss the remainder of the season due to injury, Cowboys executive vice president Stephen Jones said Friday on 105.3 The Fan. The team will move Sanders to the season-ending injured reserve as he deals with knee and ankle issues. According to ESPN's Todd Archer, it is the knee ailment that will keep Sanders on the shelf for the rest of the year as he is set to undergo a chondral tissue graft surgery. It is the same procedure Cowboys cornerback Trevon Diggs had in January.Sanders did not play in Week 5 against the New York Jets, and while he attempted to practice on Wednesday, he left the session early. Sanders also missed time in training camp with a bruised knee and sat out of a preseason game with a shoulder issue.\"Unfortunately, at the end of the day, attrition will get you,\" Jones said. \"We just found out we're going to lose Sanders for the year, our running back. These things have a way of spots opening up.\"Sanders joined the Cowboys in March as a free agent. He signed a one-year deal after being cut by the Carolina Panthers two seasons into a four-year contract. Sanders enjoyed a prolific run with the Philadelphia Eagles before his Panthers tenure and for his career boasts 4,462 rushing yards and 24 touchdowns.\nJaydon Blue to climb Cowboys depth chartWhile Sanders' injury is a blow to the Cowboys' running back group, it does also provide an opportunity for rookie ballcarrier Jaydon Blue, who made his NFL debut last week in Sanders' absence. The Texas product and fifth-round pick handled four carries for seven yards but could see a larger role in the weeks to come.Javonte Williams remains the featured back in the Dallas offense and already has 447 yards and five touchdowns to his name this season. Blue will form a one-two-punch with the fifth-year veteran as the Cowboys seek to maintain the NFL's most productive offense by yardage.\n\"We're so fired up about what Jaydon Blue can do for this offense,\" Jones said. \"He's got rare explosiveness. I know Coach Schottenheimer and his offensive staff are going to certainly continue to figure out the best way to use him. I think he's really going to bring something to this offense at the running back position that we haven't had. As much as I respect and think a lot of Sanders, I think at the end of the day, Blue can really bring some more juice to this offense.\"\n            \n    "

No deal is imminent, but those talks follow a meeting Pujols had on Thursday with general manager Perry Minasian.Right after the regular season concluded, the Angels announced that neither manager Ron Washington nor interim skipper Ray Montgomery would return to their dugout in 2026. Montgomery, of course, filled in for Washington when the latter was on medical leave.Pujols was subsequently named as owner Arte Moreno's preferred candidate to take over. It's worth noting that Pujols remains employed by the Angels. The contract he signed with the club as a player included a 10-year personal-services pact upon his retirement. Pujols has essentially served as an ambassador for the organization since walking away after the 2022 season. (MLB has since banned personal service contracts, and it's unclear how it would factor in here.)\nPujols, 45, remains slated to manage the Dominican Republic in next spring's World Baseball Classic. Last winter, he won the Dominican Winter League championship as the manager of Leones del Esogido.Pujols was one of the best players in recent baseball memory. Across parts of 22 years, he hit.296/.374/.544 with 703 home runs and 117 stolen bases. His contributions were worth 101.2 Wins Above Replacement, per Baseball Reference's estimations. Pujols was an 11-time All-Star honoree, a three-time Most Valuable Player Award winner, a two-time Gold Glove Award winner, a six-time Silver Slugger Award winner, and a two-time World Series title winner.\nThe Angels have had little success or stability at manager since Mike Sciscoia vacated the post in winter 2018. Pujols would be their fifth full-time skipper in the last eight years, alongside Washington, Phil Nevin, Joe Maddon, and Brad Ausmus.\n            \n    "

    "body": "\n        Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson will miss his second straight game as he was officially ruled out Friday for Sunday's Week 6 matchup against the Los Angeles Rams. Jackson, who missed last week's 44-10 loss to the Houston Texans with a hamstring injury, did not practice all week. His absence means backup Cooper Rush will once start under center for a Baltimore team mired in a three-game losing streak and off to its worst start (1-4) since 2015.The 31-year-old Rush struggled against Houston, completing 14 of 20 passes for 179 yards and three interceptions as the Ravens were outgained in total yards 417-207. He will again be tasked with leading a struggling offense that has scored just 30 combined points over its last two games.Jackson, a two-time NFL MVP and four-time Pro Bowler, has thrown for 869 yards, 10 touchdowns and one interception in four games this season while completing 71.6% of his passes. His status beyond Sunday remains uncertain, particularly with Baltimore scheduled for a Week 7 bye. Jackson was injured during the Sept. 28 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs.Baltimore is seeking to avoid becoming one of the few teams in NFL history to mount a playoff push after a 1-5 start; only four teams have done it. The Ravens have also endured defensive struggles, giving up 81 points in its last two games and now tasked with trying to stop quarterback Matthew Stafford and the Rams' high-powered passing attack.\n\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 6 buy or sell: Cowboys making the playoffs?

The Central Michigan product spent seven seasons with the Dallas Cowboys, posting a 9-5 record in relief of Dak Prescott.Rush signed a two-year, $6.2 million deal with Baltimore in March, giving the Ravens what they hoped was reliable depth behind Jackson.He made his Ravens debut in Week 4 at Kansas City, entering the game after Jackson exited with a hamstring injury. It was a brief and uneven outing, as Rush completed 9 of 13 passes for 52 yards while the offense struggled to find rhythm. Despite that rough start, his experience will be critical as Baltimore faces another game without their star quarterback.\nRush has appeared in 41 NFL games, starting 15. Over his career, he has completed 61.2% of his passes for 3,694 yards with 20 touchdowns and 13 interceptions. On the ground, Rush is much less of a threat compared to Jackson with 61 carries for 20 yards and no touchdowns.\n            "

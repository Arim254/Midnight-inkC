Moffitt spent a few years out of football before landing on the Texas A&M staff under Mike Elko as the team's director of strength and conditioning. If the Aggies needed any extra motivation going into Tiger Stadium, Moffitt was there to provide it. A&M quarterback Marcel Reed gave reporters insight into the week leading up to the game, including one particular detail: Moffitt brought in a tackling dummy with Kelly's face on it for Thursday's practice.\nThe Aggies fell behind 18-14 at halftime before completely dominating the second half to stay atop the SEC standings with Alabama. Reed finished 12 of 21 for 202 yards and two touchdowns and also added 108 yards and two more scores on the ground in a statement win.\n        \n            \n                Brian Kelly buyout, contract details: What it would cost LSU to fire coach as Tigers fall shy of expectations\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Aggies improved to 8-0 and simultaneously defeated Kelly's squad for the second consecutive year under Elko. Last season, Texas A&M came from behind to win 38-23 in College Station in Year 1 of Elko's tenure. This time around played out similarly, as the Aggies scored 35 unanswered points in the second half to pull away for good and put Kelly's job status in a difficult position as his Tigers are likely to miss the College Football Playoff yet again. \nThat's likely music to Moffitt's ears after Kelly elected not to retain him and instead brought over Jake Flint from South Bend. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 Texas Longhorns made history as the first Texas team to earn the AP Poll's preseason No. 1 ranking, but Steve Sarkisian's bunch has not lived up to those expectations. That's led to some frustration in Austin, and on Saturday, hours before Texas was set to go on the road to face Mississippi State, a report emerged that Sarkisian was interested in a move to the NFL and potentially the Tennessee Titans' vacancy. That rumor got quickly shut down by Sarkisian's agent, but it was an indicator that both sides might be looking to the future in Austin. That's a major change from earlier this year when Sarkisian got another pay bump at Texas, making him one of the nation's five highest-paid coaches. After a 5-2 start and some struggles with Mississippi State on the road, it begged the question: what would it cost for either side to get out of their current deal? Steve Sarkisian contract, buyout detailsIncluding his $10.8 million salary this season, Sarkisian's contract pays him $75.8 million through the 2031 season. As part of his new deal, not only did he get a pay bump but his buyout jumped from 70% of what he was owed to 85%, which is a significant and important change. That meant coming into this season his buyout jumped to $64.4 million, and  if they decided to fire him during the year, USA Today cites his buyout for December 1 as being $60.3 million. \nIf Texas were to fire him after this season but before 2026, he would be owed $55.25 million. That is an awful lot of money, but it would not be the most we've seen paid by a team in the state of Texas, as Texas A&M paid Jimbo Fisher $75 million to leave College Station not long ago. As for Sarkisian's reported interest in jumping to the NFL, it's hard to imagine him getting paid in line with his current deal at Texas, either in annual money or contract length. On top of that, his original contract stated that he would owe to Texas $4 million if he left before the end of the 2025 season, with that figure dropping to $3 million to leave before the end of the 2026 season. \nIt seems unlikely an NFL team would jump at paying that much on top of what it would cost to bring Sarkisian from the college ranks to the pros. Texas, meanwhile, would have to be willing to pay one of the biggest buyouts in history to get rid of Sarkisian, but if there is any program in the country that could come up with $55+ million (depending on the timing of firing him), it would be the Longhorns.  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        While the Week 9 college football schedule did not provide as many games between ranked teams, the updated AP Top 25 poll could see even more shakeup than the week before thanks to some impactful results throughout the rankings. By the end of Saturday, a total of six ranked teams took losses in Week 9, opening plenty of room for teams to move up on voters' ballots. That's going to benefit teams with gaudy win totals as we hit the final stretch of the season, as just avoiding a loss can be as beneficial as a signature win when it comes to rankings movement. That said, one of the most notable movements we're projecting is from a quality win featuring a top 10 team. Ole Miss went into Norman as an underdog against Oklahoma, yet the Rebels jumped out to an early lead and closed the game strong to emerge with an eight-point win to improve to 7-1 on the season. Since the only loss on the season is against Georgia, in Athens, it's unlikely Ole Miss can move higher than No. 5, but look for that voting points gap to close as a response to the Rebels gusty win in the rain. Elsewhere, we're monitoring whether Texas A&M will get any first-place votes after a dominant win against LSU in Death Valley as well as if Indiana's first-place vote count will improve following the second 50+ point win of the season against a conference opponent. The No. 1 team in the country, Ohio State, was off in Week 9, so while the Buckeyes have done nothing to give up ground, they also were unable to make the kind of statement win we saw from No. 2 and No. 3. \n        \n            \n                Bowl projections: Vanderbilt enters CFP bracket as SEC's fifth team, BYU flexes as new Big 12 frontrunner\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nOf course, with a half-dozen ranked teams losing, there is going to be some noticeable changes in the top 25 beyond shuffling inside the top 10. Some of the most dramatic changes will be in the back half of the rankings with teams benefiting from low loss counts to see big moves up either in the poll or breaking into the rankings after being unranked last week. \nHere's how we think the new AP Top 25 will look on Sunday after Week 9:1. Ohio State (Last week — 1): The Buckeyes were off in Week 9 and will be back in action next week against Penn State in Columbus. 2. Indiana (2): Earlier this week, Curt Cignetti described UCLA as a 3-0 team, and it seems clear that the Bruins had the Hoosiers' attention as though they were an undefeated foe. Indiana raced out to a 35-3 halftime lead and never let up in a 56-6 victory. 3. Texas A&M (3): A thunderous result in Baton Rouge could lead to some first-place votes going the way of Texas A&M, which is now 8-0 and staring down the possibility of an all-time season in College Station. The Aggies dominated LSU in all three phases on Saturday night, handing Brian Kelly just his second-ever loss under the lights at night in Tiger Stadium.  \n4. Alabama (4): The Crimson Tide got bailed out of a tough spot at South Carolina thanks in part to the defense delivering a huge turnover in the fourth quarter that set up the game-winning score. Alabama did not play its best game, but it rose to the occasion in the crunch time on both sides of the ball and escaped Columbia with a win. 5. Georgia (5): The Bulldogs were off in Week 9 and will be back in action next week against Florida in Jacksonville. 6. Ole Miss (8): Saturday's victory against Oklahoma in Norman could go down as one of the important wins of the season because it has totally flipped the postseason outlook for the Rebels and certainly has changed how they will be judged in the rankings. Labeled a slight underdog by the oddsmakers, Ole Miss overcame a second-half charge from the Sooners and scored the final nine points of the game to win 34-26. The win helps validate what we expect will be a very good record at the end of the season (7-1 for now) and keeps Ole Miss in the thick of the SEC title race.  \n7. Georgia Tech (7): There is a tough ceiling for voting points gap when it comes to upward movement, but the Yellow Jackets are continuing to pass every test put before them here in 2025. Down multiple starters, Georgia Tech rebounded from a slow start and walloped Syracuse by a 41-16 score. Haynes King totaled five touchdowns (three passing, two rushing) by the end of the rout, and Brent Key's team is now 8-0 on the season and 5-0 in ACC play. 8. Oregon (6): While Wisconsin was not threatening to win, Oregon's 21-7 victory against the Badgers was closer than expected for much of the evening. Voters won't penalize the Ducks for a double-digit win, but when it comes to tiebreakers among one-loss teams (or growing momentum for undefeated teams like Georgia Tech or BYU), this was a game that left the door open for challengers inside the top 10.  9. Vanderbilt (10): The best start since 1941 continues as Vanderbilt improved to 6-1 with a hard-fought 17-10 win against Missouri. A defensive battle from the start, the Commodores blew the game open with an 80-yard touchdown run from Makhilyn Young and then took advantage of a Missouri turnover for the game-winning score. \n10. BYU (11): The reluctance to boost BYU's ranking will be tested, because now the Cougars are 8-0 after in impressive rally and notable win at Iowa State. The Cyclones led by double-digits at two different points in the first half, but BYU flipped the game with turnovers, picking off Rocco Becht three times and returning one of them for a touchdown. It's unlikely BYU could jump Georgia Tech, but anyone else is susceptible to getting past by a Cougars team that just keeps finding ways to win.   11. Miami (9): The Hurricanes had less than a 100-point advantage on Vanderbilt and BYU, so any sways in momentum among the voters could lead to a shuffle. Considering Vanderbilt's ranked win, BYU improving to 8-0 and Miami getting off to a slow start (before eventually cruising to a win), it's possible some spots get traded around the edge of the top 10.  12. Notre Dame (12): The Fighting Irish were off in Week 9 and will be back in action next week at Boston College. \n13. Texas Tech (14): The Red Raiders needed a get-right win after a frustrating loss at Arizona State, and they drew the right opponent with Oklahoma State coming to Lubbock. It was all Texas Tech from the jump, starting with a 99-yard touchdown on the opening kickoff, and the Cowboys did not provide much resistance in the 42-0 win.  14. Tennessee (17): The Vols offense offered quite the response from last week's loss at Alabama, rolling up 504 yards of offense and 56 points against a Kentucky team that had previously fared well against some of the more talented teams in the SEC. Rankings shakeups elsewhere will lead to a slight bump up, but no major moves in the rankings for a Tennessee team that is now 6-2 with a thin margin for error the rest of the way. 15. Cincinnati (21): The Bearcats are tied with BYU in first place of the Big 12 standings with a 5-0 record in league play and now have won seven straight games after beating Baylor 41-20 at home. It's the first seven-game winning streak since the Bearcats made the College Football Playoff in 2021, and now that's the target given the team's role in the Big 12 title race. The remaining schedule is challenging with road trips to Utah and TCU as well as a home date against the aforementioned Cougars, but everything is on the table for Scott Satterfield's team heading into the final third of the season.  \n16. Virginia (16): If voters wanted to knock Virginia a spot or two on their ballots, there is some reason given the last two weeks' performances. The Wahoos were double-digit favorites against both Washington State and North Carolina yet won both games by a combined three points, so it's fair to note that this 7-1 team has not played to expectations since beating Louisville. However, that win against Louisville is a key to any ballot shakeup, so there's not much room to move down.  17. Louisville (19): The Cardinals found a tough test in a letdown spot after beating Miami with Boston College bringing four quarters of fight despite entering the game with a 1-6 record. Louisville thankfully could rise the steady hand of star running back Isaac Brown, who totaled 205 yards rushing in the win. 18. Texas (22): Don't look now, but Texas still has everything ahead of it and can still achieve its preseason goals thanks to a comeback overtime win at Mississippi State. The Longhorns were far from efficient and lost Arch Manning to injury late in the game but found a way to come back from a 17-point fourth quarter deficit to improve to 6-2 overall and 3-1 in SEC play.   \n\n        \n            \n                Texas can celebrate its historic comeback, but consecutive OT wins vs. SEC bottom feeders exposes major flaws\n                \n                    Shehan Jeyarajah                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n19. Oklahoma (13): The Sooners, in theory, should not see a huge drop from losing a team that will be knocking on the door of the top five heading into Week 10. But the competition for ranking spots is much less competitive when you have one loss than when you have two, and now at 6-2 we're projecting Oklahoma to be tied to its loss to Texas and its win against Michigan for placement on most ballots.  20. Missouri (15): There will be a slight drop coming for Missouri as a result of the team's second loss, but there's also a dampened outlook down the road after losing quarterback Beau Pribula to injury. True freshman Sam Zollers stepped up in a tough spot, and now he's tasked with guiding Missouri the rest of the regular season as they cling on to slimming CFP hopes.  21. Michigan (25): With Justice Haynes back in the lineup, Michigan leaned on its ground game to power through a tough start at Michigan State and pull away for a respectable double-digit win against Michigan State.  \n22. Memphis (NR): It's not going to be tough for AP voters to throw Memphis right back on their ballots as the Tigers were at No. 22 just two weeks ago before the upset loss to UAB. Though getting stunned by the Blazers netted zero voting points last week, storming back from a late deficit to take down South Florida will get them back in the 20s on a majority of ballots.  23. Navy (NR): It's time for the last unranked undefeated to break into the top 25. Navy was 30th in voting points last week, and after handling business against FAU is now 7-0 overall and 5-0 in conference play. The remaining schedule includes showdowns against the rest of the contenders in the American, so this should get sorted out on the field but for now voters should not keep the door shut on another strong start from the Midshipmen. 24. Houston (NR): The Cougars had to hold on and nearly let a 24-point lead go on the road at Arizona State, but with some key stops late, Willie Fritz's team was able to improve to 7-1 overall. This team's only loss on the season has been to Texas Tech, so grading this as a top 25 resume in the sport should be a no-brainer. \n25. Utah (NR): Like Memphis, the Utes were a team that were inside the top 25 just last week and only bounced because of a 24-21 loss to BYU. With the Cougars continuing their winning ways and Utah proceeding to blow out Colorado (and doing so with a backup quarterback), it's likely they fall back into favor with the AP voters as one of the top two-loss teams in the country. Projected to drop out: No. 18 South Florida, No. 20 LSU, No. 23 Illinois, No. 24 Arizona State \n            ",

Brown as the NFL's Nov. 4 trade deadline approaches, according to ESPN. Teams around the league are \"eyeing Brown,\" but it would take a \"blockbuster offer\" for the Eagles to trade Brown, per ESPN.There was some buzz earlier this month that Philadelphia could be open to a move after Brown released a few cryptic social media posts that seemed to point at his discontent with the franchise. Brown later cleared the air while admitting that he was frustrated with the state of Philadelphia's offense to start the season. \"This is home. This is my home,\" Brown said Oct 1. \"Unfortunately, I did it to myself. I won't say 'unfortunately.' I did it to myself. This is my home. I love it here.\"\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 8 odds, predictions, expert picks: Will Aaron Rodgers topple Packers? Can Giants stun Eagles again?\n                \n                    Cody Benjamin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDespite those comments, speculation swirled again this week after Brown posted a photo to Instagram with the caption, \"Using me but not using me.\" Though that post came on the heels of 121-yard, two-touchdown outing in a win over the Minnesota Vikings, many wondered whether it was a shot at the team amid his slow start. \nOutside of a 109-yard performance against the Los Angeles Rams in Week 3, Brown combined for eight catches for 42 yards in three out of Philadelphia's first four games. He made the earlier social media posts after a two-catch, seven-yard performance in the Eagles' Week 4 win against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Though Brown is averaging a career-low 56.4 yards per game, Philadelphia has made an effort to get Brown more involved in the offense in the weeks since. His performance against the Vikings was his best of the season. Brown has been ruled out for Sunday's game vs. the New York Giants because of a hamstring injury, but he's not expected to be sidelined for long. \nBrown has eclipsed 1,000 yards receiving in each of his three seasons with Philadelphia after the Eagles acquired him in a trade with the Tennessee Titans during the 2022 NFL Draft. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Believe it or not, but the second month of the 2025 regular season is wrapping up in Week 8, and the stakes are only getting more intense. Not only are teams looking to separate themselves into playoff position, but front offices are also gearing up for the Nov. 4 trade deadline. That makes these next couple of weeks that much more intriguing from a roster construction standpoint. Are there glaring needs that need to be filled? Or are various players auditioning for trades? It's a fascinating time of the year. It also makes it that much more juicy on the betting market as well. Despite six teams on the bye in Week 8, there are several notable matchups on Sunday, including Aaron Rodgers taking on his former Green Bay Packers team in prime time. To make sure you're situated, we've rolled out our last-second best bets for Week 8 -- including a best bet in that Rodgers-Green Bay matchup -- and picks for the remaining slate. NFL odds courtesy of FanDuel Sportsbook.

The Patriots swept the road trip and settled back into Gillette Stadium with a matchup against the Cleveland Browns. This will be a tough test for Drake Maye and the Patriots offense as the Browns do boast a sturdy defense. While the offense could be slowed somewhat, the mismatch here comes with the Browns offense vs. the Patriots defense. Cleveland is 30th in the NFL with just 16.1 points per game and 178.1 passing yards per game entering Week 8. Over this three-game road trip, the Pats held opponents to 17.3 points per game and are allowing just 19 points per game for the season overall. It's hard to imagine Dillon Gabriel exceeding either of those averages without some help from the defense, like he did last week against Miami. Maye may not give them much opportunity to help out the offense as the second-year quarterback has been efficient with the football, so New England should be able to manage the touchdown spread. Projected score: Patriots 27, Browns 17The pick: Patriots -7\n        \n            \n                Prisco's Week 8 NFL picks: Cowboys beat Broncos in shootout, Packers spoil Aaron Rodgers' revenge game\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nGreen Bay Packers at Pittsburgh SteelersSunday, 8:20 p.m. (NBC | Fubo, try for free)I was pretty surprised to see the Steelers as a home underdog in this spot. Yes, the defense was lit up by Joe Flacco and the Bengals to begin Week 7, but I don't think this club should be catching a field goal at home. Over his tenure as the head coach of the Steelers, Mike Tomlin is 21-7-3 ATS as a home underdog and has covered seven straight entering Sunday night as a prime-time underdog. Meanwhile, Aaron Rodgers is playing well, leading up to his first matchup against his former Packers team, and you better believe he'll be treating this game like the Super Bowl. Speaking of Green Bay, the Pack haven't been as dominant as they were to begin the season in recent weeks, and have not been a strong bet on the road. Coming into this matchup, the Packers are 0-3 ATS on the road this season and are 1-1-1 straight up. I can see Green Bay's talent ultimately winning out, but Pittsburgh will keep it close enough to cover. \nProjected score: Packers 24, Steelers 23The pick: Steelers +3Miami Dolphins at Atlanta FalconsSunday, 1 p.m. ET (CBS | Paramount+)The Dolphins are on the verge of blowing it up. Mike McDaniel feels like a dead man walking, and Tua Tagovailoa may not be long as Miami's QB1 either. They are coming off a demoralizing 31-6 loss to the Browns, where Tagovailoa recorded his second game in a row with three interceptions. Those struggles likely won't subside against a Falcons defense that is allowing the fewest passing yards per game (141.2) and second-fewest total yards per game (265.2) this season entering Week 8. On top of offensive struggles for Miami, its key weakness on defense could be exploited by the Falcons as well. The Dolphins are allowing the most rushing yards per game (159.3) in the NFL, and now have to face Bijan Robinson. It could be another eye-popping statistical day for the Falcons back en route to a win and cover. Projected score: Falcons 30, Dolphins 20The pick: Falcons -7Tampa Bay Buccaneers at New Orleans SaintsSunday, 4:05 p.m. (Fox | Fubo, try for free)Folks aren't looking at this as a smash spot for the Bucs for a couple of reasons. One, they are playing their second straight road game on a short week after taking on the Lions on Monday night. Second, they are banged up with Mike Evans, Chris Godwin, and Bucky Irving among the notable pieces sidelined for this NFC South matchup. Despite all that, I still will lay the points. While the Saints have played teams hard this season, it has hardly shown up where it matters most, owning a 1-6 straight-up record and are 2-5 ATS. They routinely fall to above .500 teams (6-21 since 2021), and neither side of the ball has a truly dominating quality. They are scoring 17.9 points per game (29th) offensively, and are allowing 26.6 points per game (27th). Tampa Bay's defense should do enough to continue to nullify the Saints, and I expect a bounce-back effort for Mayfield even with a depleted cast. Since 2023, the Bucs are 12-4 ATS following a loss. Projected score: Buccaneers 27, Saints 20The pick: Buccaneers -4.5Rest of the bunchBills at PanthersProjected score: Bills 30, Panthers 23The pick: Panthers +7.5Bears at RavensProjected score: Ravens 27, Bears 24The pick: Bears +3.5Giants at EaglesProjected score: Eagles 30, Giants 20The pick: Eagles -7.5Jets at BengalsProjected score: Bengals 24, Jets 17The pick: Bengals -6.549ers at TexansProjected score: 49ers 23, Texans 20The pick: 49ers +1.5Cowboys at BroncosProjected score: Broncos 27, Cowboys 24The pick: Cowboys +3.5\nTitans at ColtsProjected score: Colts 33, Titans 14The pick: Colts -14.5Commanders at Chiefs (Monday)Projected score: Chiefs 30, Commanders 17The pick: Chiefs -11.5\n            ",

    "body": "\nIt's El Clásico time as Real Madrid and Barcelona meet with first place in LaLiga on the line. Entering the match, Los Blancos lead the league by two points over Barcelona, but Xabi Alonso will look to end a five-match losing streak to his rivals. In Barcelona's LaLiga winning season last campaign, victories over Real Madrid were critical to securing the title, as not only do they lead to points in the table, but the psychological blows that losing this match can bring are also critical. Barcelona are already throwing barbs via Lamine Yamal, who recounted the last time that he went to the Bernebeau, Barcelona won 4-0, but the young star will need to back up those words. Without Raphinha and Robert Lewandowski, Barcelona's fate will be on his shoulders as Kylian Mbappe and Real Madrid will put Wojciech Szczesny under immense pressure in net.Here are storylines, how you can watch the match and more:How to watch Real Madrid vs. Barcelona, oddsDate: Sunday, Oct. 26 | Time: 11:15 a.m. ETLocation: Estadio Santiago Bernabeu -- Madrid, SpainTV: ESPN2 | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)Odds: Real Madrid -115; Draw +340; Barcelona +250Last meetingIf this match is anything like when these two last met in May near the end of the LaLiga season, we're all in for a treat. Real Madrid went ahead by two goals in the first 15 minutes via a brace from Kylian Mbappe before Barcelona stormed back. Barcelona scored four goals in the first half, including a brace by Raphinha. While Real Madrid did score again late, for Mbappe to complete a hat trick, it wouldn't be enough, eventually falling to their rivals.HistoryIn competitive fixtures, this will be the 262nd meeting between he two teams. A Barcelona victory would level the series between the duo as it currently stands with 105 Real Madrid wins, 104 Barcelona wins, and 52 draws. In LaLiga specifically, Real Madrid have won 79 matches to Barcelona's 76.Injury updatesReal Madrid come into the match with two defensive injuries as David Alaba and Antonio Rudiger are set to miss out on the match. Given that neither has been among the first-choice options in the back line, that only hurts the strength of the Madrid bench more than anything. For Hansi Flick's Barcelona, it's quite a different story as he's missing four starters. Joan Garcia and Marc Andre ter Stegen are both out, leaving him with his third-choice keeper, and both Gavi and Dani Olmo are missing from the midfield, while the attack will be down Lewandowski and Raphinha. That forces an entire rethink in the Barcelona attack, where Yamal and Marcus Rashford will be key to Barcelona's performance here. Predicted lineupsReal Madrid: Thibaut Courtois, Alvaro Carreras, Dean Huijsen, Eder Militao, Fede Valverde, Jude Bellingham, Aurelien Tchouameni, Franco Mastantuono, Arda Guler, Vinicius Junior, Kylian MbappeBarcelona: Wojciech Szczesny, Alejandro Balde, Ronald Araujo, Pau Cubarsi, Eric Garcia, Pedri, Frenkie de Jong, Marcus Rashford, Fermin Lopez, Lamine Yamal, Ferran TorresPlayer to watchMarcus Rashford, Barcelona: Without Lewandowski, all eyes will be on Rashford's performance. Since joining from Manchester United during the summer, he has been finding his form with five goals and six assists in only 12 appearances. Popping up on the left wing or as a striker, Rashford has added to Flick's depth, keeping the team afloat during their current injury crisis. Coming into facing Real Madrid in form, the pressure will be on Rashford to add to his goal tally. Flick has had faith in the English forward and it has paid off, but he'll need more to keep things going.PredictionBarcelona's injuries will prove to be too much to overcome in this match. Real Madrid are a team that can beat the offside trap which sets things up for Mbappe to score a brace in his home stadium. Opening up a five-point lead atop LaLiga with a win, this will be step one to Real Madrid's eventual title win as Xabi Alonso's team are well and truly back. Pick: Real Madrid 3, Barcelona 1\n            ",

This is in spite of the fact that the Patriots will be playing from the lead. Look for the Browns to stymie the run and create their typical great pass rush, which will lead to Maye getting the ball out quickly in the short area.

Look for Philadelphia to continue to play well on offense like they did in beating the Vikings on Sunday as they get revenge for the last meeting. Eagles take it.   Pick: Eagles 30, Giants 17 | Odds via Caesars Sportsbook, where new users get 20 100% profit boosts with the code CBS20X:New York Jets at Cincinnati Bengals (-6.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThe winless Jets travel to play a Bengals team that seems revived with Joe Flacco. The Jets are likely making a quarterback change, benching Justin Fields for Tyrod Taylor. It really doesn't matter because the offense isn't good with either one. The Bengals offense is good. Look for Flacco to stay hot and win it.  Pick: Bengals 29, Jets 14 | Odds via BetMGMSan Francisco 49ers at Houston Texans (-1.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe 49ers will have Mac Jones under center again as they face a Texans team on a short week after a loss to the Seahawks on Monday night. Houston has offensive line issues that show up weekly. The Texans defense, though, is really good and will make life tough on Jones. Texans take it behind their defense.Pick: Texans 23, 49ers 17 | Odds via DraftKings SportsbookTampa Bay Buccaneers at New Orleans Saints (+4.5)Sunday, 4:05 p.m. on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Bucs are playing consecutive road games on a short week, which can be a challenge. They didn't play well on offense against the Lions on Monday night and are now without Mike Evans. The Saints have been competitive in a lot of their games, and this has the feel of a Bucs victory, but it's close.Pick: Buccaneers 23, Saints 21 | Odds via Caesars SportsbookDallas Cowboys (+3.5) at Denver BroncosSunday, 4:25 p.m. on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThe Cowboys head out on the road with their high-flying offense to go against a good Denver defense that didn't play well last week. The Cowboys have defensive issues, but the Broncos have struggled early in games on offense. I think this is one of those spots for Dak Prescott to win a shootout with the Broncos. Cowboys in an upset.Pick: Cowboys 34, Broncos 31 | Odds via FanDuel SportsbookTennessee Titans at Indianapolis Colts (-14)Sunday, 4:25 p.m. on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThe Colts are rolling right now, scoring a league-best 33.1 points per game. Daniel Jones and Jonathan Taylor are both putting up big numbers. It will be a challenge for Tennessee to slow this group. I don't think they will, and Cam Ward can't keep up. Blowout.   Pick: Colts 33, Titans 13 | Odds via FanDuel SportsbookGreen Bay Packers (-3) at Pittsburgh SteelersSunday, 8:20 p.m. on NBC (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Packers are playing consecutive road games, while the Steelers are home with 10 days rest. That usually matters. But the Steelers defense was awful in the loss to the Bengals. While the Packers haven't lit it up on offense this year, this will be the chance for Jordan Love to get it going. I think he does. The Packers will beat their former quarterback in Aaron Rodgers.   Pick: Packers 31, Steelers 24 | Odds via DraftKings SportsbookWashington Commanders at Kansas City Chiefs (-10.5)Monday, 8:15 p.m. ET on ESPN/ABC (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Commanders are banged up and will once again be without Jayden Daniels (hamstring) in this one. They are also out on the road for a second straight week against a team that is getting better by the week. Look for Patrick Mahomes and his receivers to light up a Washington defense that has major problems. Chiefs big. Pick: Chiefs 37, Commanders 21 | Odds via DraftKings Sportsbook\n            ",

However, coach Steve Sarkisian wasn't in the best mood during his postgame press conference -- particularly when asked about the report from The Athletic that said he would be interested in potential head coaching openings this upcoming cycle.After the game, Sarkisian didn't hold back when addressing the report.\"It really pisses me off that one person can make a report that in turn, the entire media sports world runs with as factual,\" Sarkisian said. \"To the point of my agency and my agents have to put a statement out, that they have never done, historically.  I had to do that to protect my locker room and my team. I thought it was absolutely ridiculous. I thought it was completely unprofessional of that person to put that report out.\"And the fact that everybody ran with it is borderline embarrassing for the media. I respect what you guys do, I really do, and everybody else, but the fact that everybody ran that as truth is really embarrassing. I've got a small circle and when I make decisions on what I do and what I don't do. Nobody would speak on my behalf without me knowing.\"\n\n        \n            \n                Steve Sarkisian's NFL interest isn't new, but timing of latest report raises questions at turbulent Texas\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAn industry source told CBS Sports' John Talty last month that Sarkisian, who has coached in the NFL before as a coordinator and position coach, was expected to have interest in the Miami Dolphins job if it were to open. The report from The Athletic specifically mentioned that Sarkisian would have interest in the Tennessee Titans' job. The Titans will be looking for a new coach after firing Brian Callahan earlier this month following a 1-5 start. Shortly after the report, Jimmy Sexton and Ed Marynowitz, Sarkisian's agents at CAA, issued a statement denying their client had interest in moving to the NFL.\n\"Any reports regarding communications on coaching opportunities with NFL teams are patently false and wildly inaccurate,\" Sexton said. \"Sark is solely focused on coaching the University of Texas football team.\"\n            \n    ",

The No. 10 Commodores defeated No. 15 Missouri on Saturday to improve to 7-1 for the first time since 1941. The 17-10 victory was the Commodores' second against a ranked opponent in as many weeks and third on the year, and it cemented them as both College Football Playoff and SEC title contenders heading into the final month of the regular season.Fittingly, star quarterback Diego Pavia was the one to score the winning touchdown for his Commodores. Pavia has been the face of Vanderbilt's rise toward the top of the SEC ladder over the last two seasons and is in the midst of building a Heisman Trophy résumé as strong as any in the country. He punched the ball in from a yard out with 1:52 to play to break a 10-10 tie and put Vanderbilt on top for good.That was one of two rushing scores on the day for the Commodores. Running back Makhilyn Young delivered the play of the game when he broke loose late in the third quarter for an electric 80-yard sprint -- the first touchdown for either team.\n        \n            \n                Beau Pribula injury: Missouri QB expected to miss rest of regular season after hurting ankle vs. Vanderbilt\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nVanderbilt's defense also did a solid job of containing Missouri's most formidable weapon, SEC rushing leader Ahmad Hardy. He fell short of the 100-yard mark for just the third time this season. The Tigers also had to overcome the loss of quarterback Beau Pribula, who left the game with a serious ankle injury.\nThis is just the fourth time in program history that Vanderbilt has topped the seven-win mark in consecutive seasons. It is a feat that occurred just twice this century with former coach James Franklin accounting for the previous accomplishment in 2012-13.The Commodores also never had more than one victory over an AP Top 25 opponent in a season until this year. In fact, their four wins over ranked teams matches their total from 1975 to 2023 combined. There is ample time to add to their tally before the end of the campaign, although their next chance may not come until the regular-season finale against No. 17 Tennessee, their in-state rival.\nVanderbilt's tremendous start to the season begs the question, \"How far can the Commodores go?\" The first double-digit-win campaign in school history is well within reach. And as long as they hit that threshold by the end of the regular season, they should have a strong enough case to get into the playoff for the first time and perhaps even host a first-round game.\n            \n    ",

The Aggies stand as the final undefeated team remaining in the SEC after a 7-0 start, including four straight wins to start conference play. However, the Tigers mark the first ranked SEC opponent of the year, though Texas A&M also beat No. 8 Notre Dame on the road earlier this year. Conversely, LSU is on its last legs after losing against No. 13 Ole Miss and No. 17 Vanderbilt in the past three weeks. The Tigers lost their first game against the Commodores since 1990 as LSU allowed 239 yards and three touchdowns on the ground to Diego Pavia and his offense.

The Aggies added Mario Craver and KC Concepcion over the offseason, and the pair has emerged as one of the best duos in the country. However, Mansoor Delane, AJ Haulcy and the LSU secondary are elite. It will be a fascinating chess match. Growth of Reed: The Aggies made a bold move by turning the keys to sophomore Marcel Reed at quarterback, and he has delivered. Reed has thrown for 1,770 yards, rushed for 241 yards and scored 19 touchdowns for the Aggies. He had a historic moment with a game-winning touchdown pass against Notre Dame on fourth down. His mobility has been a huge asset for Texas A&M as it charges towards an SEC title. \nOffensive line woes: LSU's offensive line has been an inconsistent unit all year long, and things could get worse as left tackle Tyree Adams suffered an injury that could keep him out multiple games, according to CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz. LSU ranks No. 15 in the SEC in rushing offense at 112.9 yards per game, and has a tough test with Texas A&M's highly-rated defense.   Texas A&M vs. LSU prediction, picks  \nThe Aggies face their toughest defense of the season as Mario Craver and KC Concepcion match up with future NFLers led by Mansoor Delane. It will be an ugly, low-scoring game, but Texas A&M will shut down LSU's running game and force mistakes with their aggressive defense.

    "body": "\n        Dodgers catcher Will Smith is overshadowed, perhaps perpetually so. He's buried beneath much bigger names like Shohei Ohtani, Freddie Freeman and Mookie Betts on the Dodgers. As a great hitting catcher, he's stuck behind Cal Raleigh. He's not even the most famous Will Smith in California.Smith was overshadowed again in Game 2 of the World Series. Smith was integral to the Dodgers' 5-1 victory, which pulled them even, 1-1, in the best-of-seven Fall Classic. His battery-mate, pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto, just happened to be even more integral.Yamamoto deserves all the praise he's going to get. He's now gone back-to-back complete games in the playoffs, a feat unheard of for decades (it hadn't happened since 2001). He was masterful. We can't ignore Smith, though. He came through with a two-out, RBI single to get the scoring started in the first inning. He broke a tie with a solo home run in the top of the seventh. He put the ball in play with the bases loaded in the eighth and ended up with an RBI fielder's choice. That's a 2 for 4 game with three RBI. Not too shabby. \nBear in mind Smith, as a catcher, is also involved in game-planning with the pitcher and working with him all night. Yamamoto gets the lion's share of the praise for his outing, but Smith was helpful behind the plate, too, calling pitchers and working with his pitcher. \"I think the game calling, the relationship with the pitchers has continued to get better,\" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said after the game. \"He's always had the bat to ball, the ability to hit to all fields, the ability to hit verse left, verse right. He understands when to pick his spots. He does his homework. I think at the end of the day, he's a guy that just doesn't panic. He's really got a flat-line heartbeat, and in the postseason, that's what you need.\"Smith entered the postseason with a hand injury, to the point that it looked like he might not be able to play defense and would just be a pinch hitter. He's back to being the full-time catcher, though, and he's hit .314 with six RBI in 40 plate appearances.\nIn the regular season, Smith had his best year. He was limited to 110 games, but slashed .296/.404/.497, good for a 152 OPS+. The league only hit .245 with a .315 OBP this year and catchers were held to a .238/.306/.394 line, so Smith exceeded his fellow backstops by nearly 60 points of average and roughly 200 points of OPS. How many people really noticed what an offensive force he was this season? Dodgers fans. Fantasy baseball players. That might be about it. Why? Because Smith was overshadowed. Raleigh hit 60 home runs and might win the American League MVP. He set a new record for catcher home runs. Smith had a much higher average and OBP. Speaking of MVPs, Ohtani is likely to win the honor in the National League. It'll be his second straight with the Dodgers in his first two seasons in Los Angeles. Freeman and Betts have also won MVPs and all three hit in front of Smith in the lineup, once again, you guessed it, overshadowing him.\nSmith would be one of the biggest stars on a good number of MLB teams. On this Dodgers team, though, he's easy to miss. Not that it seems to bother Smith. He signed a 10-year, $140 million extension that started before the 2024 season. Did you even remember that? Maybe. But maybe not. Why? You know the answer. The Dodgers have a boatload of much more eye-popping contracts. Once again, he's overshadowed. Game 2 of the 2025 World Series made perfect sense. Smith was central to the Dodgers win and relegated to a mere footnote. He deserves more credit than that, however, as he's one of the best catchers in baseball and just had an amazing performance to help his team win a World Series game.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        LSU came into the 2025 season with lofty expectations under Brian Kelly, but after a third loss to a ranked opponent in four weeks, the Tigers are now 5-3 overall, 2-3 in SEC play and all but eliminated from College Football Playoff contention. After losing to Ole Miss at home in Week 6, LSU went on the road and lost to Vanderbilt in Week 8 before getting blasted at home 49-25 by No. 3 Texas A&M on Saturday night. The Tigers jumped out to an 18-14 halftime lead over the Aggies but were dominated 35-7 in the second half in one of the most embarrassing losses of Kelly's tenure. It was so bad that \"fire Kelly!\" chants were heard across Tiger Stadium during A&M's second-half onslaught.With No. 4 Alabama looming on the schedule following an off week, pressure is at an all-time high for Kelly to lead the Tigers to big wins if he's going to quiet the noise about his job status. With the loss on Saturday, Kelly is now 34-14 in his four seasons at LSU, where the Tigers have lost at least three games in each of his seasons in charge and failed to reach the Playoff. Given the expectation at LSU is to win national championships, that streak continuing with such a lopsided home loss certainly raises questions about whether Kelly should remain in his post leading the Tigers. \nBrian Kelly contract, buyout details Kelly signed a 10-year contract in 2021 and is making $9.4 million this season, with 6 years and $58.2 million remaining on his deal that runs through 2031. His buyout calls for Kelly to be paid 90% of his salary through the remainder of his contract, which would be $52,380,000 if he's fired after this season. If they fire him during the season, they'd add 90% of whatever is remaining of the $9.4 million he's owed for this year to that figure. Kelly, who is 63 years old, could also look at retirement after this season if he felt it was best for him to step down. We've seen a number of long-time coaches step away from college football in recent years, citing the changing landscape of revenue-sharing and NIL, so it's not out of the realm of possibility that Kelly could step away willingly -- or at least, amicably. In any case, with the coaching carousel already spinning quickly, we could see more teams entering the fray after James Franklin's firing at Penn State made it clear that no buyout is too large. Arkansas and Florida are already open, and a number of other SEC teams could be mulling coaching changes in what figures to be one of the crazier years for coaching movement. \nThat said, the $52-plus million that would be owed to Kelly is one of the 10 biggest in the sport and LSU would need to feel extremely confident it had a superior coach lined up to make that kind of decision. \n            ",

    "body": "\nThe NFL trade deadline is a little more than a week away, and among the more popular receivers being floated as possible trade candidates is the New Orleans Saints' Chris Olave. Reports have linked Olave with the Bills, Eagles, Giants, Patriots and Steelers, among others. On some levels, the Saints moving on from the 25-year-old receiver prior to the Nov. 4 deadline makes sense. New Orleans (1-6) remains one of the worst teams in the league, and their timeline to rebuild the franchise into a NFC contender doesn't align with the Olave's prime, which is arguably right now. Also, he is signed only through the 2026 season. If the team does not feel confident in its abilities to extend Olave's contract, it would benefit from getting what it can for him from a receiver-needy team with Super Bowl aspirations.But with every game this year, the price for Olave is going up. The 6-foot, 187-pound wideout is having a solid comeback season. After missing most of 2024 with multiple concussions, Olave leads New Orleans in virtually very important receiving category, including receptions (44), targets (71), receiving yards (440) and receiving touchdowns (three). He is on pace to set career highs in catches and touchdowns. In the last two weeks, he has had six catches for 98 yards against the Patriots and five catches for 98 yards and two touchdowns against the Bears. \"I feel like I'm just getting in my groove, last game, this game,\" Olave said after last week's game. \"So I feel like it's only going to get better.\"SportsLine player prop expert Alex Selesnick believes Olave is in store for another big performance on Sunday against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Selesnick, who is 1,014-805 and up $3,003 on all prop picks since joining SportsLine in 2021, has made Olave Over 61.5 total receiving yards (-118) one of his top three player props for Week 8 of the NFL season.Selesnick notes that Olave has a favorable matchup against the Buccaneers. The Tampa Bay defense is giving up 229.0 passing yards per game, which ranks 21st in the league. That defense also will be without pass rusher Haason Reddick (ankle, knee), who already has been ruled out, and may be without lineman Vita Vea (foot), who is questionable.\"Olave's target share, targets per route run, first read target rate, and his expected points per game all point to untapped upside,\" Selesnick says. \"In a matchup against a Bucs defense that has been a pass funnel and is missing numerous starters, this is a spot where Olave could deliver another strong performance.\"But the speculation of the Saints' trading Olave may be a moot point. He has said that his representation and the front office have been discussing the terms of an extension \"since the beginning of the year.\"That will certainly make Saints fans happy, much like his play has.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Alex Pereira isn't impressed by the state of the UFC heavyweight division. After a deflating end to Tom Aspinall vs. Ciryl Gane at UFC 321, Pereira reminded everyone how he can inject life into the land of giants.Pereira kept a close eye on Saturday's main event, a fight that disappointingly ended in a no contest after Aspinall suffered an eye poke in Round 1. Gane was overdelivering as the underdog before the fight-ending foul occurred. In response to the fight, Pereira offered to \"make the heavyweight division great again.\" Three emojis -- a stone face, a bone and a white house -- accompanied the caption, denoting Pereira's desire to fight Jon Jones at the White House. Pereira has been petitioning to fight Jones at next year's card set to take place at The White House, which President Donald Trump previously announced would take place on June 14, ever since reclaiming the light heavyweight title from Magomed Ankalaev earlier this month. Pereira wants to move up to heavyweight for a potential Jones fight, one he called a \"super fight\" while rejecting the idea of fighting Aspinall.\n\nUFC CEO Dana White is lukewarm on Pereira moving up to heavyweight. He also previously said there was a \"billion to one\" odds he'd book Jones for the White House card. Jones continues campaigning for the fight and accepted Pereira's callout on Saturday.\n\"Alex, I'd be down to bring the highest skill level to the White House,\" Jones wrote on Twitter. \"I appreciate the respect you showed. Let's dance.\"\n            \n    ",

Tate, a projected first-round pick, caught 51 passes for 875 yards and nine touchdowns in 11 games this season for the Buckeyes, who were eliminated from the College Football Playoff in the quarterfinals last week by Miami.Tate, who ranks No. 5 overall in CBS Sports' NFL Draft prospect rankings, missed three games this season due to injury and closes out his collegiate career with 121 catches for 1,872 yards and 14 touchdowns.\nDuring the Buckeyes' national championship run in 2024, he recorded 52 receptions for 733 yards and four touchdowns. The junior crossed 100 yards receiving in four games this season, including a nine-catch, 183-yard explosion against Minnesota in October.Listed at 6-foot-3, 195 pounds, Tate is CBS Sports' No. 2 wide receiver behind Arizona State's Jordyn Tyson. In Mike Renner's most recent mock draft, Tate is the first wide receiver off the board, going to the Washington Commanders at No. 7 overall. \nLast year, Ohio State became the first school to ever have a wide receiver drafted in the first round in four straight years with Emeka Egbuka, Marvin Harrison Jr., Jaxon Smith-Njigba plus Garrett Wilson and Chris Olave in 2022. The Buckeyes will likely make it five straight years come April before Jeremiah Smith joins that group in 2027. \n            \n    ",

Fresh off a championship in the inaugural season of TGL, the Georgia-based squad has continued to roll with Tuesday evening's commanding 7-4 victory over The Bay Golf Club serving as a perfect continuation of the team's second season.Despite the stress-free nature of the result, Billy Horschel, Patrick Cantlay and Atlanta newcomer Chris Gotterup found themselves in a fight early against Ludvig Åberg, Shane Lowry and Wyndham Clark. Down 2-1 after four holes -- due to The Bay throwing two early hammers -- Atlanta won two of the next three holes to claim the triples session by a slim 3-2 margin. Cantlay and Gotterup both chipped in from off the green in key moments to help build the advantage.The Bay quickly tied the match with a win on No. 10, but it came at the cost of using its final hammer. Without the point multiplier at its disposal, The Bay could not match the output from Atlanta Drive with birdies coming from the blade of Gotterup and Horschel, along with a heady hammer throw by Cantlay.Atlanta improved to 2-0 on the season and reclaimed the top spot in the standings, while The Bay dropped the first match of its second campaign.\nHmm …It's tough to sell a tech-based league that continues to have glitches. Players were left scratching their heads when Clark struck a 9-iron on the par-5 2nd that traveled north of 200 yards and ultimately found a virtual, watery grave. They laughed it off, made some jokes and were on their way, but the issues did not stop there. Clark was at the center of it a second time when his tee shot on the par-3 12th could not be located on the green. Officials had to be brought onto the putting surface with one physically measuring from the hole where to place Clark's ball. \nGreenside changes paying dividendsMultiple modifications were made heading into the second season of TGL with a subtle one showing the biggest difference thus far. It's not the hole designs. It's not the larger green with more hole locations. Rather, it is the move to put have all the grass around the green down-grain. This allows players to play those fun, nippy chip-and-pitch shots and show off a little bit. Gotterup's tricky shot below is proof of that.\n            \n    ",

He is among the numerous potential candidates to replace Brian Callahan, who was fired by the Titans midseason after he opened the 2025 campaign with a 1-5 start.Garrett has not been a head coach since 2019 and last worked on the sidelines in 2021 as the New York Giants' offensive coordinator. The 2016 NFL Coach of the Year spent the entirety of his head-coaching career with the Cowboys from 2011-19, where he went 85-67 and won three NFC East crowns. Garrett, 59, was linked to college jobs after his New York ouster but never returned to coaching. He has been a regular on NBC's NFL and Notre Dame football broadcasts since 2022.\n        \n            \n                Ranking head coaching vacancies: Which of these seven jobs is the most desirable?\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhile he logged double-digit wins in three separate seasons with the Cowboys and received a long leash from owner Jerry Jones, Garrett's tenure flamed out after multiple years of inconsistency and a failure to advance deep in the playoffs. Dallas reached the postseason just three times throughout his tenure and never made it beyond the divisional round.\nGarrett's two-year run as the Giants' offensive coordinator was highly underwhelming. New York ranked No. 31 in points and yardage in both seasons, leading to a midseason firing in 2021.The failed run as the leader of the Giants' offense and the inability to contend for Super Bowls with high-end offensive talent in Dallas raises questions about Garrett's fit in Tennessee. The Titans would undoubtedly benefit from a bright offensive mind capable of developing rookie quarterback Cam Ward, and Garrett would be a risky hire in that regard.The Titans also requested or scheduled interviews with Denver Broncos defensive coordinator Vance Joseph, former Cleveland Browns coach Kevin Stefanski, Kansas City Chiefs offensive coordinator Matt Nagy and defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo, Indianapolis Colts defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo and former Atlanta Falcons coach Raheem Morris, according to various reports. They opened their interview process with Morris on Monday and are expected to continue their process at least through the weekend with Stefanski set to interview on Saturday.\nIt remains to be seen how large of a player Tennessee will be in the John Harbaugh sweepstakes. The Baltimore Ravens fired their coach of 18 years on Tuesday, making him the immediate top available candidate on the market for the six open jobs.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Detroit Lions have fired offensive coordinator John Morton after just one season, the team announced. Morton, previously the passing game coordinator of the Denver Broncos, was hired to replace Ben Johnson, who left last offseason to become the Chicago Bears' coach. Under Johnson's tutelage, the Lions led the NFL with 33.2 points per game in 2024 en route to a 15-win season. This year, the Lions finished tied for fourth in scoring (28.3), third in passing yards and eighth in red zone efficiency but failed to reach the postseason for the first time since 2022, going just 9-8 on the heels of consecutive NFC North titles. The Lions went 12-5 in 2023, losing to the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship Game, and then went 15-2 in 2024, only to get upset in the divisional round by the Washington Commanders. The team had Super Bowl aspirations entering 2025, but fell well short of expectations. \n        \n            \n                One reason for each NFL non-playoff team to be optimistic: Premium draft picks, young quarterbacks and more\n                \n                    Josh Edwards                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLions coach Dan Campbell took over as the team's offensive play-caller prior to their Week 10 win over the Commanders. At the time, Campbell downplayed the change while saying that the team's play-calling was a collaborative effort. \n\"It was just, let's try something a little different,\" Campbell said at the time. \"Look, I know what I want to do, I know how I want to do it. Now, that being said, this is a collaborative effort. I was taking input from John Morton that whole time, and the other coaches.\" While that may have been true, it's clear now that Campbell wasn't happy with the direction of the Lions' offense. Meanwhile, Johnson enjoyed highly-successful season with the Bears that included an NFC North division title. Chicago will host the Green Bay Packers this weekend in the NFC wild card round. The Lions were just 20th in the NFL on third down and 14th in rushing despite having one of the league's best running back duos in Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery. While Gibbs enjoyed a big season, Montgomery was carried the ball a career-low 158 times. \nMorton, 56, was a senior offensive assistant on Campbell's staff in Detroit in 2022 before two years in Denver. He had a previous stint as an offensive coordinator with the New York Jets in 2017 and also worked as an offensive assistant with three other teams -- the Las Vegas Raiders, New Orleans Saints and San Francisco 49ers. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Baltimore Ravens made a significant move on Tuesday, firing coach John Harbaugh after 18 seasons. Harbaugh, the winningest coach in Ravens history, immediately vaults atop the list of available coaching candidates. How attractive is Harbaugh on this coaching carousel? His agent, Bryan Harlan, said he received calls from seven different teams expressing interest in Harbaugh 45 minutes after the news broke, per ESPN. There are just seven jobs open currently, and the Ravens didn't call about their former coach. That means there's an NFL team out there right now considering firing their own coach for a shot at Harbaugh.Who could that team be? The Miami Dolphins have not fired Mike McDaniel following a disappointing 7-10 campaign. He is 35-33 during his four seasons in South Beach, but 0-2 in the playoffs. Todd Bowles thinks he has done enough to keep his job with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after three straight NFC South titles, but how does the organization feel about him moving forward? \nMaybe Jerry Jones makes an aggressive move for the Dallas Cowboys, or could the Cincinnati Bengals move on from Zac Taylor and seduce Harbaugh with star quarterback Joe Burrow and the idea of coaching against his former team twice a year?\n        \n            \n                Ravens fire John Harbaugh: Five landing spots for Super Bowl champion coach, including team with no vacancy\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nApart from the Ravens, there are six franchises searching for new head coaches: the New York Giants, Tennessee Titans, Atlanta Falcons, Las Vegas Raiders, Cleveland Browns and Arizona Cardinals. And there apparently is already a team to watch, as ESPN reports that Harbaugh is expected to emerge as the favorite for the Giants.\nYou can understand why teams are excited about the prospect of hiring Harbaugh. He is the winningest coach in Ravens history, going 180-113 during his time in Baltimore, won Super Bowl XLVII in 2013, and was named NFL Coach of the Year in 2019. Harbaugh has won eight road playoff games over his career, which are the most by a coach in NFL history. However, the Ravens have struggled in the playoffs over the last 12 seasons, winning just four games. \n            ",

The Mountain West Offensive Player of the Year committed to Nebraska on his visit Tuesday.Colandrea's arrival marks a pivot for Nebraska, which over the weekend appeared to have its quarterback situation for 2026 sorted out. Former Notre Dame signal-caller Kenny Minchey committed to the Cornhuskers on Sunday but flipped his pledge to Kentucky a day later, leaving Matt Rhule in search of another starting option.Rhule has his man in Colandrea, who is tasked with replacing two-year starter Dylan Raiola. Raiola, a former five-star recruit, helped elevate the Cornhuskers out of an extended bowl drought, but Nebraska still remains in search of a true breakout season after going 7-6 in each of the last two seasons. Raiola entered the transfer portal at the end of his second campaign in Lincoln.Colandrea brings three years of starting experience to Nebraska and has the potential to be one of the Big Ten's most dynamic quarterbacks. He was a prolific runner at both UNLV and Virginia and made strides as a passer during his lone season with the Rebels. His 3,459 passing yards led the Mountain West, and his 23 touchdowns were a career high. He also cut down on his turnovers in 2025, throwing nine interceptions across 14 games. That was a major step forward for a gunslinging quarterback who racked up 20 picks over the previous two years.\nNebraska offensive coordinator Dana Holgorsen will have a dual-threat weapon on his hands for the first time in Lincoln. Raiola, while adept at avoiding pass rushers, was a pocket passer in every sense of the term. While Colandrea is not as refined of a thrower as his predecessor, his skill set could unlock something in a relatively stale Cornhuskers offense.Targeting a mobile quarterback seems to have been a priority for Rhule and Holgorsen, as Minchey was also set to bring notable rushing ability to the program before he flipped his pledge to Kentucky.\nColandrea is a three-star prospect in the 2026 transfer portal cycle, per 247Sports, and ranks as the No. 21 quarterback and No. 175 player overall.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        One of the NFL's most stable franchises is making a major change. John Harbaugh is out as Baltimore Ravens coach, ending an 18-year tenure in the Charm City that included 180 wins (fourth-most in the NFL), a Super Bowl championship and 12 playoff berths.The Ravens were the NFL's most disappointing team in 2025, going from preseason Super Bowl favorites to missing the playoffs. Injuries to Lamar Jackson and a plethora of the team's other top standouts were costly, but Baltimore also regressed in several other areas. The offensive line took a step back, Derrick Henry wasn't the overwhelmingly dominant force he was a year earlier, the defense had one of the NFL's worst pass rushes, and the secondary gave up too many big plays.Plus, even when Jackson did play, he wasn't ever the full, MVP-winning version of himself after suffering a hamstring injury in Week 4 and missing a month. He also missed one game with a back injury and dealt with knee, ankle and toe issues all year.\n        \n            \n                What's next for the Ravens? Big questions for Lamar Jackson, John Harbaugh after disappointing 2025 season\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nStill, this immediately becomes the most enviable opening in the NFL. Jackson was fantastic for stretches, and he nearly carried Baltimore to a Week 18 win-or-go-home victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers. Harbaugh's firing comes one day before Jackson's 29th birthday, and though Jackson has missed significant time in three of the last five seasons, he remains an electric talent.\nHe's also an electric talent in need of a new contract -- a process that hasn't always been the easiest to navigate -- and Baltimore has several other needs to address this offseason.Make no mistake, though: This is still a team that is expecting to win and win now. Baltimore has a solid core around Jackson in place for the future, highlighted by Henry, Zay Flowers, Ronnie Stanley, Nnamdi Madubuike and Kyle Hamilton. The Ravens will be looking for a coach who can not only maximize Jackson but finally get both him and the team as a whole over the playoff hump.1. Kevin Stefanski (Former Cleveland Browns head coach)The Ravens have seen Stefanski's squads up close and personnel for the last six years, and though Baltimore has been the more talented team for almost that entire span, Stefanski's Browns earned a split every year from 2021-24.\nStefanski has gotten teams over the hump. The Browns hadn't made the postseason since 2002 before he arrived, and he took them to the postseason twice. He's done it with a variety of quarterbacks. He made several impactful hires on the defensive side of the ball, and he's a two-time AP Coach of the Year.Still just 43 years old, Stefanski will be highly sought-after across the league and has already been requested to interview for several teams' coaching vacancies.\n        \n            \n                NFL coach, GM interview tracker, updates: Vance Joseph drawing plenty of interest\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhile it may be easy to dismiss Stefanski due to his overall record (45-56), he did a very good job in trying circumstances, especially given the team's disastrous Deshaun Watson trade and extension. He crafted top-tier rushing offenses in his early days in Cleveland and his final season as Minnesota offensive coordinator, and he helped make a viable passing environment for a team that churned through quarterbacks like no other. In 2023, the Browns finished 10th in scoring despite starting Watson, Joe Flacco, P.J. Walker, Dorian Thompson-Robinson and Jeff Driskel.\nJackson would be a luxury Stefanski has never had. The Ravens must address the interior of their offensive line -- notably re-signing Tyler Linderbaum -- but Stefanski would be in tremendous position to take advantage on Henry on the back end of his prime. For a win-now team, Stefanski would be a strong fit, and for Stefanski, a win-now team with few distractions and stable ownership/front-office personnel would be a dream-like change of scenery.2. Brian Flores (Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator)Jackson's injuries and ensuing level of play were the face of the Ravens' disappointment, but the defense's nosedive was no less to blame. Only the Cincinnati Bengals allowed more plays of 20-plus yards this season, and only two teams had fewer sacks.The answer, potentially? A coordinator whose defenses have long caused as much havoc as any. Flores, 44, led yet another strong Minnesota defense in 2025; the Vikings finished third in total defense and seventh in scoring defense. In six seasons as either coach or defensive coordinator, Flores has fielded five top-half scoring defenses, three in the top 10.\nFlores is aggressive -- Minnesota's 47.1% blitz rate over the past three years is first by a wide margin -- and creative. He has made the most of nearly every unit he has had. Last year, Andrew Van Ginkel made his first Pro Bowl and was seventh in Defensive Player of the Year voting, and Jonathan Greenard made his first Pro Bowl and was 11th. This year, 2024 first-round pick Dallas Turner broke out with eight sacks, and 2024 undrafted free agent Jalen Redmond had six. He can patch together and elevate linebackers and secondaries, too.Flores has gotten the most out of stars, accomplished (if aging) veterans and youngsters alike. The Ravens have several in all three categories.Finally, though Flores' run as Miami Dolphins coach is most remembered for an unceremonious end and, later, him suing the NFL, he recorded winning seasons in two of his three years there. Many, including Aaron Rodgers, have called for Flores to get another chance.\nFlores, it should be noted, is a free agent, so he'll have some significant negotiating power.3. Jesse Minter (Los Angeles Chargers defensive coordinator)There are plenty of connections here: Minter, 42, had a spell with the Ravens from 2017-20, rising from defensive assistant to assistant defensive backs coach to defensive backs coach. He then left to join John Harbaugh's brother Jim at Michigan and, eventually, at Los Angeles. Furthermore, the Ravens made a midseason swap of Odafe Oweh for Alohi Gilman in a mutually beneficial deal.More important than the connections, though, there's a fit: Minter is the mind behind a Los Angeles defense that is among the game's best. The Chargers are fifth in yards per game allowed, second in interception rate and first in goal-to-go defense. Those marks come despite the Chargers fielding the league's second-cheapest defense and a lengthy Khalil Mack absence. Minter's secondary is disciplined and aggressive, and much of the production has come from younger players around stalwart Derwin James. Minter would have a talent upgrade in Baltimore and still have a star safety in Hamilton.\n4. Klint Kubiak (Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator)The mind behind a top-10 Seahawks offense, Kubiak is another hot commodity. The Ravens are quite familiar with the Kubiak family. Klint's father, Gary, was the Ravens' offensive coordinator in 2014, only leaving to pursue his dream job as Denver Broncos coach (and leading them to a Super Bowl).Klint, 38, has experience with some of the NFL's best minds, including his own father, Stefanski, Kevin O'Connell and Kyle Shanahan. He has brought a sturdy, play action-heavy attack to Seattle, one that has allowed Sam Darnold to thrive and Jaxon Smith-Njigba to become a star. Kubiak could also aim to bring some of the defensive coaches from Seattle along considering just how good the Seahawks have been on that side of the ball.Furthermore, there's a connection between the two franchises: The Seahawks hired Mike Macdonald away from Baltimore two years ago. Perhaps Baltimore will return the \"favor.\"\n5. Vance Joseph (Broncos defensive coordinator)Joseph, 53, lasted just two seasons in his 2017-18 coach in Denver (11-21 record), but it's impossible to ignore what he has done in his most recent run as the team's defensive coordinator since 2023. The last two seasons, the Broncos are first in sacks, sack rate and pressure rate. Their 131 sacks are 33 more than any other team. He has developed young talent along the defensive line (Nik Bonitto, Jonathon Cooper, Zach Allen) and in the secondary (Patrick Surtain II, Riley Moss, Ja'Quan McMillian). A former NFL defensive back himself, Joseph has strong bonafides.It would be crucial for Joseph to prove he can get his offensive hire right and can do a better job with game management than he did as the Broncos' coach. Still, he'll be busy on the interviewing circuit.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Baltimore Ravens are making a major organizational change, as the franchise fired coach John Harbaugh Tuesday after 18 seasons. The move comes after the Ravens finished the 2025 campaign with an 8-9 record -- just Harbaugh's third losing season in Baltimore -- and failed to reach the postseason after opening the year with major expectations. Baltimore had a chance to clinch the AFC North title on Sunday night, but lost the win-and-in Week 18 showdown against the rival Pittsburgh Steelers, 26-24, on a last-second missed field goal. Harbaugh, who was under contract through 2028 after signing a new three-year deal last offseason, was the second-longest tenured coach in the NFL (behind Pittsburgh's Mike Tomlin) and is the winningest coach in Ravens history, going 180-113 during his time in Baltimore. The 63-year-old Harbaugh went 13-11 in the postseason, won Super Bowl XLVII against his brother, Jim, in 2013, and was named Coach of the Year in 2019. His eight road playoff victories are the most by a coach in NFL history, yet the Ravens made the AFC Championship just once following the franchise's second Super Bowl victory. In eight seasons with two-time MVP quarterback Lamar Jackson leading the offense, the Ravens won just three postseason games and never made it past the conference championship round.\"Following a comprehensive evaluation of the season and the overall direction of our organization, I decided to make a change at head coach. Today I informed John that he has been relieved of his duties,\" Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti said in a statement. \"This was an incredibly difficult decision, given the tremendous 18 years we have spent together and the profound respect I have for John as a coach and, most importantly, as a great man of integrity. \n\"Throughout what I firmly believe is a Hall of Fame coaching career, John has delivered a Super Bowl championship to Baltimore and served as a steadfast pillar of humility and leadership. He and his family have deeply embedded themselves in this community. For these profound contributions, on and off the field, we should all be forever grateful.\"\n        \n            \n                What's next for the Ravens? Big questions for Lamar Jackson, John Harbaugh after disappointing 2025 season\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHarbaugh was reportedly confident he would return to Baltimore to chase a Lombardi Trophy in 2026, but he was not granted that opportunity. In a statement, Harbaugh said he was disappointed but filled with gratitude and appreciation. \"Well, I was hoping for a different kind of message on my last day here, someday, but that day has come today. It comes with disappointment certainly, but more with GRATITUDE & APPRECIATION,\" Harbaugh said. \"Gratitude to the owner and organization who was willing to bring in a head coach who made his mark with Special Teams success. A difficult thing to do … and appreciation for all the moments, all these years, that are etched into eternity.\"\nWhile Harbaugh is out in Baltimore, he suddenly becomes the most attractive prospect on the coaching carousel -- including with the New York Giants. Harbaugh is \"expected to emerge as a favorite\" for the vacancy in New York, according to ESPN. According to CBS Sports Research, Harbaugh has the eighth-most wins (180) by a coach with a single team in NFL history. \nCoachTeamWinsRecordWin PctSeasonsYearsGamesGeorge HalasChicago Bears318318-148-31.6821920-196740497Bill BelichickNew England Patriots266266-121.6872000-202324387Don ShulaMiami Dolphins257257-133-2.6591970-199526392Tom LandryDallas Cowboys250250-162-6.6071960-198829418Curly LambeauGreen Bay Packers209209-104-21.6681921-194929334Chuck NollPittsburgh Steelers193193-148-1.5661969-199123342Mike TomlinPittsburgh Steelers193193-114-2.6282007-202519309John HarbaughBaltimore Ravens180180-113.6142008-202518293Ravens have fallen short of expectations in recent seasonsRecently, the Ravens acquired the reputation of being a regular-season juggernaut that failed when the stakes were high. When Jackson won his first NFL MVP in 2019, the Ravens earned the No. 1 seed in the AFC. However, they were upset by the Tennessee Titans in their first postseason matchup. After avenging that playoff loss to the Titans the very next year in the wild-card round, the Ravens fell to the Buffalo Bills in the divisional round, 17-3, while Jackson exited with an injury. The Ravens missed the playoffs in 2021 after finishing with an 8-9 record. Jackson started 12 games, but suffered a late-season ankle injury that forced him to miss the final four games of the year. The following season, Baltimore returned to the playoffs, but Jackson suffered a knee injury that held him out of the wild-card matchup against the Cincinnati Bengals. Tyler Huntley started in his place. In 2023, it appeared the stars were aligning for Baltimore. The Ravens clinched the AFC North with a 13-4 record, and Jackson won his second NFL MVP. Baltimore blew out the Houston Texans in the divisional round, setting up a date with Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC Championship Game. However, the Ravens would commit three turnovers in a devastating 17-10 home loss. Jackson had another MVP-type campaign in 2024, but lost out on the award to Josh Allen of the Bills -- the same team that defeated the Ravens in the divisional round that season. \nHarbaugh won just four playoff games over the last 12 seasons after winning an NFL record nine in his first five seasons as coach. This season, the Ravens started 1-5 but rallied with a five-game winning streak after the bye week to get back into the playoff hunt. However, Harbaugh's group lost four of their final six games, capped off by the loss in Pittsburgh on Sunday night with the division on the line. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Scoot over Kevin Stefanski and Klint Kubiak, there's a new most sought-after coach in the 2026 NFL coaching carousel: John Harbaugh. The Baltimore Ravens fired their coach of 18 seasons (2008-2025) on Tuesday two days after losing the de facto AFC North championship game to the Pittsburgh Steelers on a missed field goal as time expired.Harbaugh's Ravens went 180-113 in his 18 seasons, good for the fourth-best in the NFL in that span behind only the New England Patriots (193-100), the Pittsburgh Steelers (183-108-2) and the Green Bay Packers (182-108-3). His 13 playoff wins are tied for the seventh-most in NFL history along with Mike Holmgren. Harbaugh's eight road playoff wins are the most in NFL postseason history. He helped lead Baltimore to the second Super Bowl title in franchise history with a victory in Super Bowl XLVII over the San Francisco 49ers to conclude the 2012 season. Harbaugh earned NFL Coach of the Year honors in 2019 when the Ravens produced a 14-2 record in quarterback Lamar Jackson's first of two NFL MVP campaigns. Blowing a 10-0 lead against the Steelers on Sunday night ended up being the final straw for Harbaugh, whose 26 blown leads of 10-plus points are the most by any coach since 2008 when he took over the Ravens' job. Twelve of them occurred over the last five seasons, which is five more than any other team in the NFL. After his 180 wins with the Ravens, the eighth-most by any coach with one team in NFL history, Harbaugh will now be arguably the most coveted coach of this NFL hiring cycle. Here's a look at his top five landing spots now that he is available.\n\n        \n            \n                Ranking head coaching vacancies: Which of these seven jobs is the most desirable?\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Cleveland Browns If Harbaugh desired to go the petty route, he could remain in the AFC North with the Cleveland Browns after they fired Kevin Stefanski. Cleveland needs a breath of fresh air after the doom and gloom trading for and extending quarterback Deshaun Watson brought their franchise. Harbaugh oversaw the drafting and development of quarterback Joe Flacco, who won Super Bowl XLVII honors, and Jackson, who won NFL MVP honors in 2019 and 2023. Coaching soon-to-be two-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year edge rusher Myles Garrett after he just broke the league's single-season record with 23.0 in 2025 could be very appealing. He'll just need to help Cleveland navigate a successful search for a franchise quarterback after hitting on two with the Ravens in Flacco and Jackson. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Atlanta Falcons The Atlanta Falcons are perhaps the most win-now option of the current NFL coaching vacancies given their young talent and being in the NFC South, a division the Carolina Panthers won with a losing record (8-9) in 2025.\nRunning back Bijan Robinson, at 23 years old, led the NFL in scrimmage yards (2,298). Wide receiver Drake London, 24, has flashed No. 1 wide receiver potential at times. Tight end Kyle Pitts, 25, is showing progress after producing a career-high 88 catches, the second-most in the NFL among tight ends in 2025. Defensively, the Falcons had the 2025 rookie leader in sacks and quarterback pressures (edge rusher James Pearce Jr. with 10.5 sacks and 45 quarterback pressures), the No. 2 2025 rookie leader in sacks (edge rusher Jalon Walker) and the 2025 rookie leader in interceptions (safety Xavier Watts with five). That's a strong foundation for a team whose division is up for grabs every season. If Harbaugh can help the Falcons get the quarterback position right, Atlanta could be a contender for years to come.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New York Giants The New York Giants have their hopeful quarterback of the future in place with 2025 first-round pick Jaxson Dart. He ended his rookie year on a high note with 230 yards passing and two passing touchdowns while completing 22 of his 32 throws for a career-high 110.2 passer rating in a 34-17 victory over the Dallas Cowboys. Pro Bowl wide receiver Malik Nabers will be back for Year 3 fully recovered from a torn ACL. \nPro Bowl edge rusher Brian Burns finished second in the NFL in sacks with 16.5, and the Giants also have Pro Bowl defensive tackle Dexter Lawrence in the middle with 2025 third overall pick edge rusher Abdul Carter developing on the other side of the defensive line as well. If Harbaugh wants to coach what is arguably the most talented defensive line in football with some offensive playmakers already in place, the Giants make plenty of sense. It will be interesting to see if he would want to work with general manager Joe Schoen or if he would prefer entering a new team with a general manager he already possesses an established rapport with. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Las Vegas Raiders The Raiders are a blank slate Harbaugh can mold in his own image since they have the 2026 NFL Draft's first overall pick. He can handpick his preferred quarterback between Oregon's Dante Moore and Indiana Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza. \nHe would be pairing one of those passers with 2024 sixth overall pick running back Ashton Jeanty. Jeanty is the first rookie in NFL history with 900-plus rushing yards (975), five-plus rushing touchdowns (4) and five-plus receiving touchdowns (5). Plus, 2024 first-team All-Pro tight end Brock Bowers, who will be in just his third season in 2026. Five-time Pro Bowl edge rusher Maxx Crosby is also a fantastic defensive foundation block. However, the AFC West is a gauntlet with the No. 1 seed Denver Broncos, the playoff-bound Los Angeles Chargers and Patrick Mahomes' Kansas City Chiefs. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Miami DolphinsThe Miami Dolphins still employ coach Mike McDaniel, but there's a chance that could change with Harbaugh's availability flipping the whole NFL coaching carousel upside down. Team owner Stephen Ross is a huge fan of the Harbaugh family as a prominent University of Michigan alum: the university's business school is named after the Dolphins owner. That could lead to Ross moving heaven and earth to land Harbaugh. Miami already has a general manager vacancy, so the Dolphins could offer Harbaugh the chance to pick his own GM.\nMiami will be headed toward a rebuild in 2026 and 2027 with the failed nature of the Tua Tagovailoa era that netted zero playoff wins, which could put the Dolphins in prime position to draft University of Texas quarterback Arch Manning in 2027. That setup, plus the opportunity to live in South Florida as Harbaugh enters his mid-60s, could be quite appealing. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Kliff Kingsbury has been many things as a coordinator and coach -- Case Keenum's college offensive coordinator, Johnny Manziel's college offensive coordinator, Patrick Mahomes' college coach, Kyler Murray's NFL coach and Jayden Daniels' NFL offensive coordinator -- but he's also always been one thing: himself.The up-tempo, shotgun-centric \"Air Raid\" (with adjustments) offense has been his thing. Good, bad, in the middle, regardless of location or role. He's always been a tireless worker: Back in 2022, \"Hard Knocks\" captured him waking up just after 3 a.m. and arriving at the Arizona Cardinals' practice facility before 4 a.m., citing his playing career not reaching the heights he wanted as a motivating factor. With the Washington Commanders, he and Daniels were consistently among the first people at the facility.\"I'm pretty consistent with the coaching style,\" Kingsbury said early in 2025 training camp, when he was coming off the Commanders' breakthrough.\n        \n            \n                NFL Power Rankings: Big miss on Seahawks and preseason top 10 as Chiefs, Lions miss postseason\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAnd near the end of the year, Washington's disappointing 5-12 season that proved his ouster?\n\"Yeah, I've seen [the no-huddle offense] done at a high level you know, whether it's Arizona or here at a very high level and won games and had a lot of yards, a lot of success in that regard. So, I think I'm pretty confident, you know, in that style of play when the pieces are there that you can play a really high level, and it's a very challenging offensive stop.\"Kingsbury, 46, didn't have the pieces this year; that much is certain. Daniels played in just seven games, and he left three of those seven early. All parties involved wished Terry McLaurin's extension had been done earlier so he could have had more time to grow with Daniels in training camp and get into football shape: McLaurin suffered a quad injury in Week 3 and played in a career-low 10 games. The team's other top outside wide receiver, Noah Brown, appeared in just four games. The offensive line wasn't whole until mid-October.And yet the Commanders still finished 12th in offensive success rate and won games with not only Daniels but Marcus Mariota and Josh Johnson. Players spoke glowingly of Kingsbury, with Daniels saying \"I love working with Kliff,\" and \"Me and him have a special relationship. Mariota praised Kingsbury's system for making things easy on the quarterback. McLaurin talked about the way he, his role and his alignments grew under Kingsbury and also complimented Kingsbury for being \"open to communication.\"\nBut coach Dan Quinn wanted a more traditional run-heavy, clock management-driven, approach, ESPN's John Keim reported, even though that goes against what Kingsbury has always been. The Commanders had the fifth-highest rushing rate in the NFL over Kingsbury's two seasons as offensive coordinator, but they also had the most quarterback rushes in the NFL (24th-most running back runs). Kingsbury's system was tremendous for Daniels in Year 1. It was less successful in Year 2 for several reasons, some out of Kingsbury's control.\"There's a ton of different decisions I wish we would've made and I would've made, and more just like individual play calls than anything, you know, our style of play was a bit different,\" Kingsbury said. \"Like I said, trying to slow the games down, limit possessions, do things of that nature. But yeah, there are a ton of things I wish I would've done better as far as scheme and maximizing players and things of that nature.\"Kingsbury couldn't control injuries. He couldn't control the defense being one of the NFL's worst.\n\"We had a bunch of guys that were kind of in and out of the lineup, and it's a credit to this staff of getting these guys prepared,\" Mariota said.It's not a \"wrong\" call from Quinn, per se, but it's certainly a big one. Sometimes circumstances change. Sometimes strategies change. The Commanders will have big changes ahead, and Quinn had better be right.Kingsbury, meanwhile, will likely be in the running for both head coach and offensive coordinator gigs. Call his offense what you will, but it is not \"gimmicky\" in any sense of the word. Kingsbury showed flexibility and creativity as a play caller and play designer. The Commanders had a well-versed, multi-faceted rushing attack and a screen game that worked wonders at its peak. Kingsbury helped produce not only a career year McLaurin but a renaissance from Zach Ertz in his mid-30s and a bounce-back from Deebo Samuel in his late-20s. He often made do with castoffs and youngsters, elevating the games of players such as Noah Brown, Dyami Brown and Olamide Zaccheaus.\nHere's where Kingsbury could end up next.1. New York Giants offensive coordinatorKingsbury has previously expressed a desire to return to head coaching, and he decided to remain in Washington last year, when he could have been one of the top candidates for an opening. How much a tough 2025 hurt his coaching candidacy remains to be determined, but his best fit could be to remain an offensive coordinator.He'll want a mobile quarterback, versatile running game and some weapons to maximize that attack, and the Giants stand out as the team that fits the bill best. Jaxson Dart showed impressive rushing ability, and the Giants have a tandem of capable backs in bruiser Cam Skattebo as well as the speedier Tyrone Tracy Jr., who has quietly reached 1,000+ yards from scrimmage in each of his two seasons. Malik Nabers looked like a star in the making before an early-season knee injury, and Wan'Dale Robinson could be a versatile, movable chess piece as well. Tracy and Robinson in particular could help fuel Kingsbury's versatility as a play caller and designer.2. Tennessee Titans offensive coordinatorCam Ward quietly finished his rookie season strongly, throwing for eight touchdowns and just one interception over his last four full games (he left the season finale with a shoulder injury but won't need surgery). He's doesn't run like Murray, Daniels or Dart, but he's not a statue, either. He showed impressive escapability down the stretch of his debut season, and his sack numbers declined in kind.\nWard has said he wants to be involved in the coach-hiring process, and if the candidate at hand isn't Kingsbury, he would do well to pitch Kingsbury as the offensive coordinator. The Titans have a long way to go int he rebuild process, but Kingsbury has developed young quarterbacks everywhere he's been. Tennessee has some gifted if inconsistent wide receivers, too, in Himere Dike and Elic Ayomanor.3. Giants coachThe Giants would do well to strongly consider Kingsbury for the main gig, not just a coordinator one. Kingsbury has undoubtedly learned from his time as the Cardinals' coach, which included him building a team from 3-13 the year before he arrived to 5-10, then 8-8, then 11-6. People often recall his final season -- 4-13 -- and his struggles down the second half of seasons most, but they forget how good of a job he did, with two-10th overall total offenses. He did it all with Kyler Murray a quarterback who not only had limitations but played his best ball under Kingsbury and now appears on his way out of Arizona.Hiring Kingsbury would be a big bet. He would have to get the call at defensive coordinator right. The Giants really struggled on that side in 2025 but have foundational pieces along the line. It's a big market that comes with a ton of scrutiny. If Kingsbury is up for it, though, he and Dart could form a strong partnership.\n4. Baltimore Ravens offensive coordinatorCould Kingsbury's home be just a short drive north? The Ravens sent shockwaves through the NFL by firing John Harbaugh on Tuesday, ending an 18-year partnership with one of the NFL's most stable franchises.Kingsbury and Lamar Jackson could be a fit for all the reasons listed about other quarterbacks: mobility, operation out of the shotgun, etc. The Ravens do have Derrick Henry, so Kingsbury might have to adjust to be more running back-centric, but he has been willing to adjust before. Zay Flowers seems like a strong fit for Kingsbury's quick-hitting passing schemes, too.It's not a perfect fit. Jackson isn't a young quarterback like basically all the others Kingsbury has worked with. Running up-tempo seems at first glance incongruous for a team that might be better suited to grind some games out in the grimy, tough AFC North. But the Ravens need change badly. They didn't fire Harbaugh to keep the status quo. Kingsbury would have to interview well and show a clear plan for melding his style to Baltimore's personnel. Just don't count it out completely.\n5. Atlanta Falcons offensive coordinatorThe Falcons fired coach Raheem Morris, and while that doesn't preclude offensive coordinator Zac Robinson from coming back, there's a reasonable chance whomever succeeds Morris will want to handpick his offensive coordinator. If that coach is a first-timer, having the experience of Kingsbury would be helpful; if it isn't a first-timer, Kingsbury could still fit the bill.Atlanta has a strong offensive line, a superstar versatile running back in Bijan Robinson and a star wide receiver in Drake London. Quarterback is a big question, but Michael Penix Jr. has operated out of the shotgun his entire career, so there's at least some synergy there. Penix isn't a dual-threat guy, but Kingsbury has shown abilities to adapt. And if Penix turns out not to be the answer, Kingsbury could again be a mentor for another young quarterback.NOTE: We didn't consider sending Kingsbury back to the Cardinals, nor did we consider him for any Las Vegas Raiders openings. Kingsbury withdrew from the Raiders' offensive coordinator search at the last minute two years ago.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 NFL regular season is in the books, and change is already in the air. The offseason is a time of immense turnover, as players switch teams via free agency or trade, teams change their rosters by acquiring them through one of those avenues or in the draft, and plenty of clubs swap out their coaches as they look to improve from one year to the next.We're here today to talk about the latter group of teams. As of Tuesday afternoon, seven NFL teams have fired their coaches. The Tennessee Titans and New York Giants fired Brian Callahan and Brian Daboll during the regular season. The Atlanta Falcons fired Raheem Morris on Sunday night. And on Monday, the Cleveland Browns fired Kevin Stefanski, the Las Vegas Raiders fired Pete Carroll and the Arizona Cardinals fired Jonathan Gannon. The Baltimore Ravens fired John Harbaugh after 18 seasons on Tuesday afternoon. In the wake of all of those changes, let's rank the coaching vacancies in order of their desirability.Follow live updates on NFL coaching and GM changes, firings and rumors.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. RavensThe Baltimore Ravens are the only team this coaching cycle that can offer prospective candidates the opportunity to coach a multi-time NFL MVP quarterback in Lamar Jackson. \nPlus, running back Derrick Henry showed no signs of slowing down in his age-31 season in 2025, rushing for 1,585 yards -- the second-most in the entire NFL. There are also a couple All-Pro building blocks on defense with linebacker Roquan Smith and safety Kyle Hamilton. Baltimore should make a playoff return in 2026 no matter who their head coach is provided they reinforce Jackson's offensive line as well as their defensive line. The Ravens do have some cap space to play with at the moment with $12.4 million in effective cap space, according to OverTheCap.com. Moving off of defensive tackle Nnamdi Madubuike's contract down the road following his neck injury could free up significant cap space in the coming years. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. FalconsThere are a couple of things working against the Falcons here: First and most importantly, there is extreme uncertainty surrounding the quarterback situation. Michael Penix Jr. is coming off yet another knee injury. Kirk Cousins is probably not long for Atlanta given that the Falcons can save $22.5 million by cutting him (or $35 million by designating him as a post-June 1 release). The Falcons also do not have a first-round pick in this year's draft after trading up for James Pearce Jr. in 2025 and are set to enter the offseason over the 2026 salary cap. \nAll that said, Atlanta has the most talent of any team with a head-coaching vacancy. Between Bijan Robinson and Drake London on offense, there is already a baseline level of star talent to build around. Kyle Pitts could be back. The offensive line is solid. The defense slowed down after an incredibly hot start to the year but still finished the year 14th in EPA per play allowed. There is at least a foundation for success on that side of the ball, if you can land on the right defensive mind, whether as the head coach or coordinator. The Falcons also play in the NFC South, which is one of the worst divisions in football.The Falcons are running this search in a strange way, though, with separate consulting firms leading the search for the coach and the general manager. Things could get weird if the GM doesn't have the chance to hire their preferred coach. \n\n        \n            \n                Falcons coaching candidates: Why Kevin Stefanski tops list, plus two Rams coordinators should be in play\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. GiantsThe Giants won't have the No. 1 pick in the draft like it seemed they would a few weeks ago, but they do have a few things working in their favor.The first is the young talent on offense, and specifically at quarterback with Jaxson Dart, who showed flashes during his rookie season that he can be a strong option for the Giants under center. Malik Nabers and Cam Skattebo are attractive as well, although they'll both be coming off of major injuries. And Andrew Thomas is an elite tackle. Then there's the defense, which boasts one of the best fronts in the league -- or should, at least. So long as the Giants have Dexter Lawrence, Brian Burns and Abdul Carter, they should be able to get after it up front. They need to improve on the second and third levels and they definitely need to get better against the run, but there's talent on this side of the ball. \nA potential issue is the ownership and management situation, where John Mara is sadly in poor health and general manager Joe Schoen is set to return (and lead the coaching search) despite not exactly having distinguished himself in the role.\n        \n            \n                Ranking reported Giants coaching candidates by category: Head coaches, coordinators and more\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. TitansTennessee restructured its front office over the weekend such that Mike Borgonzi will oversee the 53-man roster and lead the coaching search while Chad Brinker will handle the other football operations responsibilities. The Titans had one of the worst rosters and coaching situations in the NFL this season, but they might be set up to make a jump next year.Cam Ward's overall numbers don't look great, but there were so many flashes of high-level talent when you turn on the film. He was let down by a decrepit supporting cast and has a chance to be much better next year if the Titans improve the talent around him. And they'll have every chance to do so because Tennessee is set to enter the offseason with over $105 million in cap space and the No. 4 pick in the draft. \nThey're not necessarily a candidate to go worst-to-first like the Bears and Patriots did this year, but they definitely have a chance to be a lot better next season if they hit on the right coach and use their budget and draft capital wisely, like those teams did. \n        \n            \n                Renner's 2026 NFL mock draft 6.0: Raiders, Jets land QBs with top two picks as other teams miss out\n                \n                    Mike Renner                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. RaidersThe Raiders are here for four reasons: Brock Bowers, Ashton Jeanty, the No. 1 pick in the draft and $100 million in cap room. (You could say five reasons and include Maxx Crosby, but there are already rumors swirling that the Raiders are finally willing to listen to trade offers for the star edge rusher, so he may not be long for Las Vegas.) There is just not much talent on this team outside of those players. There is a loooong way to go before the Raiders can be remotely competitive, and it doesn't help that they play in the AFC West, which is one of the most competitive divisions in football. Like the Titans, though, they can take a jump next season if they hit on their coach and whichever quarterback they presumably draft with the No. 1 pick, and spend their free-agent money to upgrade the talent level on the roster.\nOne drawback here is the ownership situation, where Mark Davis seems to flail wildly from one plan to the next in quick succession. The Vegas job is not exactly stable, and doesn't come with a lot of job security, as evidenced by all the changes the Raiders have made over the last several years. \n        \n            \n                Raiders coaching candidates after Pete Carroll firing: Tom Brady ties to Patriots, plus fresh faces\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. BrownsThe Browns have a good defense built around Myles Garrett, who is just an inhuman monster coming around the edge. They drafted a pair of star rookies in tight end Harold Fannin Jr. and linebacker Carson Schwesinger. They have multiple first-round picks in this year's draft thanks to last year's Travis Hunter trade. What the Browns don't have is much other talent on offense (Quinshon Judkins will be coming off a dislocated ankle and fractured fibula), an answer at quarterback or any cap space to solve their various issues. Cleveland is set to begin the offseason more than $12 million over the cap, according to Over the Cap, and it still has the albatross of Deshaun Watson's contract weighing down its books in both 2026 and 2027, at least.\nThe Browns also have an ownership and management situation that is, shall we say, not all that desirable. The Haslam family has run one of the most unstable organizations in the league, and Andrew Berry hasn't exactly put together a great roster. (The combination of the Haslams and Berry was responsible for the disastrous Watson trade.)\n        \n            \n                Browns fire Kevin Stefanski: Here are five potential coaches who could replace him\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. CardinalsArizona lost 14 of its final 15 games this season and looked incredibly listless in doing so. The Cardinals have an uncertain quarterback situation with Kyler Murray seemingly not long for the team, and they really have no viable path to solving that situation this offseason unless it becomes a three-quarterback draft or the Jets decide to pass on someone like Dante Moore (if he enters) or Fernando Mendoza at No. 2 overall. Arizona is set to have only around $21 million in cap room (and only $9.8 million in effective cap space), per Over the Cap, so it's not like there are a lot of resources here to solve the various roster issues. \nThey do have players like Trey McBride, Michael Wilson, Paris Johnson Jr., Josh Sweat, Budda Baker, Garrett Williams, Walter Nolen and Will Johnson, but there are still a lot of holes here and not that much to build around.\n            ",

The Under has hit in nine of 14 Duke games this season, and the Under has cashed in three of the last four Louisville contests. Louisville guard Mikel Brown Jr., the team's second-leading scorer, is out with a back injury.

    "body": "\n        Washington star quarterback Demond Williams Jr. announced that he was entering the transfer portal on Tuesday night. Williams will have a do-not-contact tag when he officially enters. In a post shared to social media, Williams thanked Washington coaches, teammates and fans before announcing his departure.\"I have to do what is best for me and my future,\" Williams wrote. After much thought and prayer, I will be entering the transfer portal.\"News of Williams' intention to enter the portal comes just days after the star QB signed a new deal to return to Washington for the 2026 season. The Huskies are prepping to pursue any and all legal avenues to enforce the terms of that contract, according to ESPN. Sources tell CBS Sports' Matt Zentiz and Chris Hummer that LSU will be one of the teams to watch as Williams explores other options in the portal. The Tigers do have a need at quarterback, especially after Ole Miss quarterback Trinidad Chambliss chose to remain with the Rebels instead of following Lane Kiffin to Baton Rouge should he be granted a waiver for an extra year of eligibility that's still pending.\nOne of the best available playmakers hits open marketAs a sophomore in 2025, Williams ranked sixth in the Big Ten with 3,065 passing yards, and his 25 touchdown passes ranked fourth. He also showed off his mobility with 611 yards and six touchdowns on the ground. Williams did all that while leading Washington to a 9-4 record, which included a win over Boise State in the LA Bowl.Coming out of high school in Arizona, Williams was a four-star recruit and the No. 19 quarterback in the 2024 signing class, according to 247Sports. Although Williams didn't start for most of his true freshman season, he did play in every game before starting starting in the final two. His skill was evident, and he built upon that with a big 2025 season.In 26 games with the Huskies, Williams completed 71.5% of his throws for 4,009 yards, 33 touchdowns and nine interceptions while adding 893 yards and eight touchdowns on the ground.\nBehind Williams, the Huskies don't have a ton of experience at quarterback. The only other quarterback to attempt a pass for the Huskies this past season was Tulane transfer Kai Horton, who completed four of seven passes for 13 yards.\n            ",

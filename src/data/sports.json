Buffalo leads the league in total offense, averaging 395.8 yards per game. Quarterback Josh Allen has been spectacular this season, and he's completing 70.4% of his passes for 1,217 yards, nine touchdowns and just two interceptions. He's also racked up 212 rushing yards on 40 carries and three scores. The model projects the Bills to win in 78% of simulations, compared to their implied odds of 68.55%, making this a valuable favorite to include with a pair of underdog picks in the model's Monday DraftKings parlay.Bears (+205) to defeat the CommandersChicago had an additional week to prepare for Washington while coming off a bye, and the model projects that to play to the Bears' advantage on Monday. After a slow start with two losses, largely due to defensive struggles with Chicago allowing 39.5 ppg over its first two contests, the Bears entered the bye week off back-to-back victories as the underdog in both contests. The Bears defeated the Cowboys, 31-14, in Week 3, followed by a 25-24 win over the Raiders. Chicago has the No. 10 scoring offense (25.3 ppg) this season. The model projects the Bears to win in 37% of simulations, however, with the implied odds of +205 signaling a 32.8% chance of victory, the model sees solid value in taking the shot of Chicago upsetting Washington.Brewers (+128) to defeat the DodgersThe Brewers are using the element of surprise to their advantage, not naming a Game 1 starter as of Monday morning, coming off their five-game series victory over the Cubs on Saturday. Milwaukee, which had the best record in baseball at 97-65 this season, knocked off the Cubs, 3-1, on Saturday to improve to 3-0 at home this postseason. The Brewers went 52-29 at home this season, and they will host the Dodgers on Monday. Regardless of who starts for the Brewers, they have the luxury of one of the top bullpens in baseball, ranking sixth in bullpen ERA (3.63) this season. The Brewers also had the No. 4 scoring offense (4.96 runs per game) this season. The model projects Milwaukee to win in 57% of simulations, showcasing strong plus-money value for Monday.Want more NFL picks for Monday Night Football and MLB picks?You've seen the model's Monday best bets.

The Atlanta Falcons host the Buffalo Bills at 7:15 p.m. ET, and the Washington Commanders host the Chicago Bears at 8:15 p.m. ET. Both games have an over/under of 49.5 points, meaning fantasy points come in bunches on MNF. The Bills are 3.5-point favorites, while the Commanders are -5.5 in their respective matchups, so those potential game flows could play into NFL DFS strategy.

Terry McLaurin (quad) is the most notable player who has been ruled out. Who are the top NFL DFS picks for Bills vs. Falcons and Bears vs. Commanders, and which daily Fantasy sleepers should you target to differentiate your NFL DFS lineups and NFL DFS stacks? Before making any NFL DFS picks for Monday Night Football on sites like DraftKings and FanDuel, be sure to check out the NFL DFS lineup advice, strategy and player stacks from SportsLine NFL daily Fantasy expert Jimmie Kaylor. Kaylor is a NFL betting and DFS expert for SportsLine, who opened the 2022 NFL season by winning DraftKings' NFL Showdown Thursday Kickoff Millionaire contest. He edged out over 355,000 other entrants in the contest and also has multiple five-figure tournament wins on his DFS resume.

The former Wyoming standout was outstanding in 2024, throwing for 3,731 yards with 28 touchdowns against just six interceptions and added 12 rushing touchdowns, earning his first NFL MVP award. He guided the Bills to a 13–4 record and a deep playoff run, though they ultimately fell short in the AFC Championship Game. In 2025, Allen has continued his elite form, throwing for 1,217 yards, nine touchdowns, and two interceptions through five games. His dual-threat ability remains one of Buffalo's greatest assets, consistently pressuring defenses with both his arm and legs, making him an elite fantasy quarterback option. See who else to roster here.Part of Kaylor's optimal NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering Falcons running back Bijan Robinson.

Freddie Freeman launched a solo home run and a second run scored on a bases-loaded walk, which was just enough for the Dodgers to take a 1-0 series lead.The Brewers, the top overall seed in Major League Baseball's postseason, became the fourth and final team to advance to the league championship round on Saturday night. The Brewers advanced to their first NLCS since 2018 when they defeated the Chicago Cubs in Game 5 of their NLDS matchup to take the best-of-five series by a 3-2 margin.Whereas the Dodgers are making their fourth NLCS appearance in six years, the Brewers have reached this stage just twice since moving to the NL in 1998: back in 2018 (when they met the Dodgers) and in 2011, when they were knocked off by the St. Louis Cardinals.

Even splitting the first two road games would help, but the Dodgers are dreaming big -- mostly of back-to-back World Series wins.Brewers: After a bullpen game Monday, the Brewers will return to a traditional start with Freddy Peralta. More importantly, though, manager Pat Murphy has to figure out how to get his hitters going after Blake Snell mowed down the lineup in Game 1. That's no easy task against Yoshinobu Yamamoto, but you can't win if you don't get on base.\nGame 2 predictionBlake Snell was marvelous in Game 1 and even then the Dodgers barely held on for the win. The Brewers are too good to be held down two games in a row. Look for them to even the NLCS at one game apiece behind their ace, Freddy Peralta, in Game 2. -- Mike Axisa\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Leave it to the common sense-defying 2025 Brewers to turn a 404-foot fly ball into a double play. In Game 1 of the NLCS on Monday night (LA 2, MIL 1), Milwaukee turned Max Muncy's rocket to the center field wall into force outs at home plate and third base to escape a bases-loaded jam and keep the game scoreless. The Dodgers squared up Quinn Priester pretty well all inning and walked away with nothing.The scene: L.A. had the bases loaded with one out when Muncy hit a ball to the wall in center. Sal Frelick went up for the catch and the ball clanked out of his glove, hit the wall, then was caught on the way back down. Because the ball hit the wall before the catch, it's in play and not an out. Left field umpire Chad Fairchild correctly signaled \"no catch\" all the way.Amid the confusion, all three Dodgers baserunners held up, which gave the Brewers enough time to get the force out at the plate. Catcher William Contreras then jogged down to third base to get the force out there, ending the inning. Here's the play:\nTeoscar Hernández, the runner at third base, made the biggest mistake. He's tagging up on the play, as he should have, but even if he was unsure the catch was made cleanly, he has to break for home as soon as Frelick has the ball in his glove. Instead, Hernández waited long enough to go home that he was forced out. Will Smith, the runner at second, never advanced to third and was also forced out.\"It happened fast.  I didn't know he didn't catch it, to be quite  honest,\" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said after the game. \"We go over that rule.  Teo knows the rule.  I think right there  he had just a little bit of a brain fart, appreciating that when it  does hit the glove you can tag there.  But then he tagged, did it  correctly, then saw he didn't catch it, he went back.  That was the  mistake. But he owned it.  And after that there's nothing else you can do about it.\"The Dodgers challenged the play, hoping to get at least one of the force outs overturned, but no luck. \n\"I just wanted clarity ... They nailed it,\" Roberts said. Officially, it goes down as an 8-6-2 grounded into double play. Yes, \"grounded\" into a double play. Baseball scoring can be weird like that sometimes. Rule 5.09(a)(1) covers catching the ball. Here's the rule:A catch is the act of a fielder in getting secure possession  in his hand or glove of a ball in flight and firmly holding it;  providing he does not use his cap, protector, pocket or any other part  of his uniform in getting possession. It is not a catch, however, if  simultaneously or immediately following his contact with the ball, he  collides with a player, or with a wall, or if he falls down, and as a  result of such collision or falling, drops the ball.Frelick made contact with the ball before it hit the wall, negating the catch. Catching the ball on the way down was just a stroke of good luck (or nice defense) by Frelick. It did not result in an out. Once the ball hit the wall, it was a base hit for Muncy, and the runners had to advance. They didn't, and the Brewers turned an unconventional inning-ending double play.\"Sal caught it, then it touched the wall. A baserunner got confused, and we got it in as quickly as possible, made the play at the plate. And heads-up, William got the out at third,\" Brewers manager Pat Murphy said postgame. \"I mean, it's very unusual. It's tough for the baserunner to figure out what happened, but it's one of those plays in baseball. We got very fortunate there.\"Lost in the craziness: The Dodgers hit Priester well that inning. Hernández walked, Freddie Freeman hit a rocket to left field that Isaac Collins had to jump to catch, Smith and Tommy Edman singled, then Muncy hit a ball to the top of the wall in center. Priester and the Brewers are fortunate to escape that inning without a run scoring.\nThe double play ultimately was not costly as the Dodgers survived a bases-loaded scare in the ninth inning to take Game 1. Historically, the team that wins Game 1 of a best-of-seven has gone on to win the series 65% of the time.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Ace Bailey, or at least his former representation, seemingly did everything possible to not get drafted by the Utah Jazz. Bailey reportedly had \"preferred\" destinations which may or may not have influenced a few teams that were in position to take him in June's draft. But Utah decided the talent was too great to pass up -- even against the looming threat of Bailey not reporting to camp or just being a general malcontent -- and took him with the No. 5 overall pick. So far, this looks to have been a very smart decision. For starters, there have been nothing but positive reports about Bailey's attitude. Teammate Kyle Anderson has called Bailey's positivity \"infectious,\" while coach Will Hardy has praised the 19-year-old's \"willingness to ask questions\" and ability to \"see the game and learn on the fly.\"With the obvious qualifier that we're talking about preseason basketball, and just two games at that, Bailey has looked extraordinary on the court so far. Over 70 minutes against the Rockets and Spurs, Bailey has put up 45 points on 19-of-29 shooting. Impressive numbers, obviously. But it's the way those shots are coming, within what is clearly a concerted effort on the part of the Jazz to put Bailey in his most optimal scoring positions, that is putting to bed what was one of the universal concerns about his game in college. \nThat concern was that his offense came very hard. Everything was contested. Part of this was because Rutgers, outside of No. 2 overall pick Dylan Harper, didn't have anyone capable of drawing defensive attention away from Bailey. But it was also a problem that Bailey was so bothered by the pressure he did face. Now, when we say bothered, it doesn't mean he couldn't score against pressure. He could. And he can. Bailey's ability to bail himself out with tough shots was perhaps the biggest feather in his draft cap. But in the NBA, making tough shots off whirling spins into mid-range fades cannot be the first page of your survival guide. Sustained, efficient scoring only happens when you are operating in breathable enough airspace to access consistently clean looks.  If you can't cleanly and consistently create that space for yourself, via your own handle (which is something we know Bailey has thus far struggled to do, as evidenced by his alarmingly high turnover rate against pressure in college), then it has to be created for you. And that's what the Jazz are doing for Bailey. \nRather than asking him to start from a stationary position and create advantages in isolation, the Jazz are putting Bailey on the move so that by the time he catches the ball he is either already in, or quickly moving toward, open space. From there, he only requires one or two pressure-free dribbles to get right into a clean shot. This approach was on beautiful display in Bailey's preseason debut against the Rockets. \nIn Game 2, it was more of the same against the Spurs. \nWhat you'll notice is that in all those buckets, only one came out of isolation (and even in that one he got to his spot at the elbow with exquisite efficiency and footwork, requiring just three dribbles punctuated by a luscious spin move). In fact, Bailey has needed just 28 total dribbles to get off his 29 preseason shots so far. \nYou don't have to be a genius to do the math here. That's fewer than one dribble per shot. That is prime Klay Thompson stuff. Bailey isn't the all-time distant threat Thompson is and he's a better athlete, but the common theme between the two is that they're at their best when they're catching balls on the move rather than starting from scratch. Bailey may well evolve as an individual creator (in fact, he almost certainly will), and when he does it should allow him to get to the rim and free-throw line more. Some people are already saying they see a young T-Mac, which is lofty but perhaps not unwarranted. But for now, Bailey is clearly most comfortable as a mid-range scorer on minimal dribbling (a more athletic Rip Hamilton should have everyone in Utah very excited), and it cannot be overstated how smart it is that the Jazz are positioning him in accordance with that talent until the rest of his arsenal comes around. \n            ",

Washington is a 5.5-point favorite, while Buffalo is -3.5. The NFL DFS player pool is loaded at the quarterback position, with Josh Allen, Michael Penix Jr., Caleb Williams and Jayden Daniels all set to be in action.Other players that will likely be popular NFL DFS picks and core pieces of NFL DFS lineups are Pro Bowl running backs James Cook and Bijan Robinson. Injuries, however, will be a factor with players such as Terry McLaurin (quad) and Darnell Mooney (hamstring) ruled out.

The reigning NFL MVP remains one of the most impactful players in the game today. Allen's dual-threat ability makes him an elite red zone performer and give him a relatively high floor in all fantasy football formats.In 2025, Allen has gotten off to a solid start with 1,217 passing yards, nine touchdowns, and just two interceptions through five games. He's completed 70.4% of his passes. Allen has also rushed for 212 yards and three scores. See who else to roster here.Part of McClure's optimal NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering Falcons wide receiver Drake London. The former USC standout enjoyed a breakout 2024 season, catching 100 passes for 1,271 yards and nine touchdowns, leading the Falcons in both catches and receiving yardage across all games. He was one of the only receivers in the league to record 100 receptions, 1,000 yards, and at least eight receiving touchdowns during the 2024 season. In 2025, through four games, London has 24 receptions for 269 yards and one touchdown, averaging 11.2 yards per catch. While his early-season numbers don't quite match the pace of 2024, he's remained a steady presence in Atlanta's passing game.

He caught just three of eight targets for 13 yards on Sunday vs. the Broncos, as the Jets offense hit a new low. Justin Fields completed 9 of 17 passes for 45 yards as the offense recorded just 82 total yards.

Just three months ago, Wilson was rewarded with a four-year, $130 million extension that includes $90 million guaranteed. \nWith Wilson sidelined, expect Josh Reynolds, Tyler Johnson, Allen Lazard and Arian Smith to receive an uptick in work. Reynolds led the Jets in receiving Sunday with three catches for 25 yards. \n            \n    ",

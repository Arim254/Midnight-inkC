    "body": "\nTeams outside of the NFC playoff picture will meet on 'Sunday Night Football' when the Dallas Cowboys host the Minnesota Vikings. Dallas (6-6-1) is coming off a Thursday loss to Detroit, 44-30, which ended the Cowboys' three-game win streak. Minnesota (5-8) ended a four-game slide with a stunning 31-0 victory over Washington in Week 14.

Last week saw Minnesota play its most complete game of the year, scoring its second-most points (31) while allowing its fewest (0) as J.J. McCarthy had his best game as a pro. The second-year QB had three passing touchdowns and no turnovers as he has a great chance of continuing that type of production versus Dallas' 31st-ranked scoring defense. The Cowboys rank dead last, however, in passing defense, with additional bottom-two rankings in both third-down defense and redzone defense. The Vikings' defense is light years ahead of the Cowboys, with the former ranking No. 3 in the redzone and No. 4 against the pass. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Cowboys can coverThe Cowboys have covered in four of their last five home games in 2025, while the Vikings have dropped four of their last five, overall, versus the spread. Dallas' success is predicated on its offense, which is elite, as Dak Prescott leads the NFL in both passing yards and QBR, as the Cowboys rank first in total yards and third in points scored. At home, the Cowboys are averaging 32.7 points, which is twice as much as the 16 ppg that the Vikings are averaging outside of Minneapolis. Additionally, no team has committed more turnovers than the Vikings, who also have the league's second-worst turnover differential, and giving the ball away will only allow Dallas' high-octane offense to put more points on the scoreboard. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Cowboys vs. Vikings picksSportsLine's model has simulated Vikings vs. Cowboys 10,000 times is going Over on the total, projecting 50 combined points. It also says one side of the spread hits in 60% of simulations in an A-rated pick.

John Cena is set for his WWE farewell as part of Saturday Night's Main Event. The legendary wrestler completes a year-long goodbye to professional wrestling in Washington D.C. when he takes on Gunther in his final match in active competition. Gunther stood tall at the end of a 16-man tournament featuring superstars from Raw, SmackDown, NXT, and surprise opponents from Cena's past. After losing the world heavyweight title to Jey Uso at WrestleMania 41, Gunther had an odd year. He lost his mind as fans taunted him for tapping out against Uso and attacked both Michael Cole and Pat McAfee, which led to a match with McAfee at Backlash. Gunther then beat Uso in a rematch to reclaim the world heavyweight title before a detour to take on a retiring Goldberg. Gunther then dropped the world heavyweight title at SummerSlam before going on hiatus for multiple injuries.Cena's final year has been up and down with some incredible highs and a couple forgettable lows. He began the year by coming up short in the Royal Rumble when it was down to him and Jey Uso. Then, the infamous heel turn at the Elimination Chamber when Cena joined forces with The Rock and Travis Scott to beat down Cody Rhodes after earning his spot at WrestleMania. Cena then beat Rhodes at the event to break the record of most recognized championships at 17. After the title run and subsequent face turn came the return of Brock Lesnar to the fold where he and Cena faced off at Wrestlepalooza. Cena has also had fun throwback matches with CM Punk and AJ Styles along the way.Below is how you can catch all the action on Saturday night.\nWhere to watch 2025 WWE Saturday Night's Main EventDate: Saturday, Dec. 13, 2025Location: Capital One Arena -- Washington, D.C.Start time: 8 p.m. ETWatch live: Peacock (subscription required)2025 WWE Saturday Night's Main Event match cardJohn Cena vs. GuntherCody Rhodes vs. Oba FemiBayley vs. Sol RucaAJ Styles & Dragon Lee vs. Je'Von Evans & Leon Slater\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 Major League Baseball offseason is fully underway, and with the Winter Meetings behind us we're working our way deeper into the sport's offseason calendar. Among other things, the winter in baseball means a steady supply of rumors regarding free agent signings, trades, and the like. Speaking of which, you can find Saturday's roundup just below. Tigers, Kenley Jansen agree to termsThe Tigers have agreed to a one-year contract with veteran closer Kenley Jansen, the Athletic reports. The deal also includes a club option for 2027. Jensen is 38 years of age, but he's coming off a strong season with the Angels in 2025: \nFor his standout career, Jansen boasts an ERA+ of 155 across parts of 16 MLB seasons. As well, Jansen's 476 career saves rank fourth all-time behind just Mariano Rivera (652), Trevor Hoffman (601), and Lee Smith (478). Barring injury or ineffectiveness, he seems likely to notch career save No. 500 in a Tigers uniform. Jansen is a four-time All-Star, and as a member of the Dodgers in 2017, he finished fifth in the National League Cy Young vote. Yankees re-up with Rosario\nThe Yankees have brought back utility player Amed Rosario on a one-year contract worth $2.5 million, Jon Heyman of the New York Post reports. Last season, Rosario had an OPS+ of 109 in a combined 62 games for the Nationals and Yankees. He spent time at four different defensive positions, and for his career boasts an .800 OPS against left-handed pitching. The Yankees acquired him from the Nationals in a three-player trade leading up to this past season's deadline. Mets, Padres talking tradesThe Mets are in need of roster fortifications even after signing Jorge Polanco to a two-year free agent pact. The Padres, meanwhile, are trying to wring another year of contention out of their current core while also looking to reduce payroll at the behest of ownership. Those two aims have led to trade talks between the clubs. Here are the details from Ken Rosenthal of the Athletic: \n\"The Padres' players in the talks include right-hander Nick Pivetta, outfielder Ramón Laureano and relievers Mason Miller, Adrian Morejon and Jeremiah Estrada. San Diego, in turn, is asking the Mets about their young major leaguers and all of their top prospects, both pitchers and position players.\"Hard-throwing reliever Mason Miller, whom the Padres acquired from the A's at the most recent trade deadline, is the most intriguing name mentioned. The Mets recently lost closer Edwin Díaz to the Dodgers. While they did sign Devin Williams and can plug him in as a closer, the Mets are no doubt seeking another high-leverage arm for the bullpen. Miller certainly fits that bill. Red Sox interested in ContrerasSeeking to add power to their lineup, the Red Sox have interest in Cardinals first baseman Willson Contreras, Chris Cotillo of MassLive.com reports. Contreras is coming off a strong season with the Cardinals, and he backs it up with some of the best batted-ball metrics in baseball: \nThe former catcher is going into his age-34 season in 2026, and he's signed through 2027 with a club option for 2028. Contreras has a full no-trade clause and may prefer to stay in St. Louis despite the ongoing rebuild. That said, his right-handed pop would be an excellent fit for Fenway Park, and the Red Sox profile as strong contenders for 2026 and beyond. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The most prestigious award in college football will be handed out Saturday night as four of the top athletes in the nation descend upon New York City for the 2025 Heisman Trophy ceremony. Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza is seen as the favorite to capture the prize after leading the Hoosiers to their best season in program history, but he will have stiff competition from other top signal callers from around the sport. Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia, Ohio State quarterback Julian Sayin and Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love round out the list of four finalists that will take the stage inside the Lincoln Center's Appel Room. Mendoza and Sayin are gearing up for an appearance in the College Football Playoff after dueling in the Big Ten Championship Game, which Indiana won to capture its first outright conference title in 80 years. Pavia and Love, obviously, had successful seasons while starring for a pair of 10-win programs. The odds favor another quarterback winning the Heisman after Colorado two-way star Travis Hunter earned the award last season. Hunter's triumph snapped a streak of three straight quarterback Heisman winners. A quarterback also won the Heisman seven times from 2016-23. The 2025 Heisman Trophy ceremony will begin at 7 p.m. ET and air on ESPN. It can also be streamed live on fuboTV (Try for free).  \nOdds in parentheses below via DraftKings Sportsbook.2025 Heisman Trophy finalists, oddsFernando Mendoza, QB, Indiana (-2500): Mendoza took a commanding lead in the Heisman standings following a heroic performance in the Big Ten Championship Game. He completed 15 of his 23 pass attempts for 222 yards and the decisive 17-yard touchdown to wide receiver Elijah Sarratt. Mendoza leads the nation with 33 touchdowns passing to just six interceptions and he's also rushed for another six touchdowns on the ground. He would be the first Heisman Trophy winner in Indiana history. Diego Pavia, QB, Vanderbilt (+1100): Like Mendoza, Pavia can make history as Vanderbilt's first Heisman recipient. He's already lead the Commodores to their first 10-win season in program history, capped by their first victory against Tennessee since 2018. Pavia's established himself as one of the most electric playmakers in the country. He averaged 465.5 total yards per game and scored 16 total touchdowns in Vanderbilt's final four games. Jeremiyah Love, RB, Notre Dame (+25000): Love is holding it down as the only non-quarterback that made the cut as a Heisman finalist. It's not hard to see why. He almost singlehandedly provided the offensive firepower for a Notre Dame team that just missed out on the College Football Playoff. He was one of just two players to average at least 6.9 yards per carry while toting the rock over 150 times. His 18 touchdowns rushing also ranked third in the FBS. \nJulian Sayin, QB, Ohio State (+50000): Sayin is a smooth operator in Ohio State's explosive offense. His 78.4% completion percentage leads the nation and his 182.1 passer rating is first among FBS quarterbacks with at least 100 pass attempts on the year. He failed to complete 70% of his passes in just two games all season. Though Ohio State's elite skill position players get a lot of credit for Sayin's success, his own talent is evident with his ability to deliver the ball accurately to every level of the field. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 college football bowl schedule begins on Saturday with Boise State vs. Washington (-10). Even with the postseason landscape rapidly changing, college football bowl confidence pools remain popular, and there are 39 matchups to make college football bowl confidence picks on this season. The two biggest spreads are in the CFP First Round as Oregon is favored by 21.5 points over James Madison, while Ole Miss is a 17.5-point favorite over Tulane. While putting faith in big favorites is a part of just about everyone's college football bowl confidence strategy, correctly predicting an upset could help you separate from the pack.Anticipated matchups outside of the CFP include Penn State vs. Clemson (-4.5), Georgia Tech vs. BYU (-4.5), Tennessee vs. Illinois (+4.5) and Michigan vs. Texas (-7.5). The Wolverines will operate under interim head coach Biff Poggi after dismissing Sherrone Moore. The college football odds give you an idea of what sportsbooks deem as favorites and underdogs, but you'll need more than just those when making bowl confidence bets. Before making any college football predictions for bowl season, be sure to see the latest college football bowl confidence picks from SportsLine's proven model.New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $75 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times, and it is profitable on its top-rated money-line picks since the beginning of the 2024 season.  Anybody following its college football betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now, it has turned its attention to the latest college football odds and 2025-26 bowl season college football betting for confidence pools. Head here to see every pick. New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Top 2025-26 college football bowl confidence picks  One of the model's most confident picks is that No. 21 Houston, a 3-point favorite, gets a double-digit win over LSU in the Texas Bowl on Dec. 27. Not only is this game in Texas, but it's in Houston, providing the obvious home-field advantage for the Cougars, as LSU has lost its last four games outside of Tiger Stadium. Meanwhile, the Cougars are 5-1 straight-up when favored this season, and the Tigers' offense limps into this matchup as it has a total of four touchdowns over the last four games and won't have quarterback Garrett Nussmeier. That's the same number that Houston had in its last game, alone, as the model has the Cougars winning in 80% of simulations. See all of the model's college football bowl confidence picks here.Another one of the bowl confidence predictions the model is high on: No. 16 USC (-6.5) gets a comfortable win over TCU in the Alamo Bowl on Dec. 30. USC went 9-3 in the regular season, with all three defeats coming versus ranked teams. TCU found itself in the Top 25 once -- back in September -- before having a pedestrian run through the Big 12 schedule, finishing 5-4. Even with the Horned Frogs playing in the easier conference than the Trojans, USC both averaged more points and allowed fewer points per game. USC sports a 32-9 (78%) straight-up record when favored since Lincoln Riley came aboard in 2022, as it is projected to easily take care of business in San Antonio. SportsLine's model has the Trojans prevailing nearly 70% of the time. See the rest of the college football bowl confidence predictions here. How to make college football bowl confidence picksThe model has also made the call on who wins every other bowl game. There are 11 teams that win at least 70% of the time, so you need to go big on those matchups, as well as 15 underdogs that win outright. You can get all the model's picks at SportsLine.So who wins every college football bowl game, and which matchups should you assign the most confidence points to?

Every year, these two storied service academies get together to cap the college football regular season, and this year will be no different. The Commander-in-Chief's Trophy is on the line as the pageantry will again be a sight to behold. What also will be a sight to behold, as is usually the case, are the uniforms that will be worn by the Black Knights and Midshipmen. As is the case for some time, when the two teams meet this year on Dec. 13 in Baltimore they will wear special uniforms for the occasion. The Army-Navy Game is an opportunity for the two service academies to pay tribute the history of their branch of the armed forces, and the uniforms have become a big part of that. Follow along with live updates, highlights and analysis as the 126th Army vs. Navy Game takes center stage on Saturday.Army uniforms 2025Both teams unveiled their uniforms for the 2025 Army-Navy game, and both will pay tribute to 250 years of service in this year's game. Army was founded as the Continental Army in 1775 ahead of the Revolutionary War and will pay homage to those roots, as well as those who have died in service of their country.\nThe marble coloring of the uniform is a tribute to the headstones for soldiers at Arlington National Cemetery, while a thin purple outline around the numbers honors those who received the Purple Heart. The helmets feature the U.S. Army seal and the Espontoon, representing the Army's role as the \"tip of the spear.\" On the uniforms themselves, players will wear The Great Seal on their shoulders and have nameplates using the Constitution font. \nNavy uniforms 2025Navy's uniforms will also look back to their founding, with helmets honoring the USS Constitution and the six ships that founded the U.S. Navy. \nThe copper color of the helmets represents the copper sheeting the USS Constitution was covered in to protect its wooden hull. The helmets also feature a sketch of the USS Constitution on one side with the original USN mark on the other.The font choice for Navy on the uniform is pulled from the typography used in the \"Act to Provide Naval Armament\" document, which authorized the creation of the first naval fleet. The six ropes on the sleeves and collar represent the six original ships in that fleet, and the pants and helmet feature those same ropes, with 126 knots to commemorate the 126th playing of Army-Navy. \nThis year's Army-Navy game will be a battle between quality teams, as Army is 5-4 on the season and Navy is 8-2 and sits atop the American Conference standings with two games to go before the Black Knights.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Wherever Lionel Messi goes, he brings a scene, and that was certainly true Saturday in Kolkata. Messi and his Inter Miami teammates just capped off one of the greatest seasons in Major League Soccer history while he securing his second consecutive league MVP award and also winning the MLS Cup with Inter Miami. Now he's taking part in the \"GOAT Tour\" in India, where his first stop needed to be cut short due to fan unrest.The grand tour began with the unveiling of a 70-foot-tall statue of the Argentine superstar, but quickly devolved from there as he came to see waiting fans at Kolkata's Salt Lake Stadium. There fans responded to an event that kept Messi at a removed distance from them with ripped up seats and threw things toward the pitch as Messi, Rodrigo De Paul, and Luis Suarez aborted a planned lap around the stadium. Those fans paid around $133 dollars for tickets to have a chance at seeing Messi, but the view was obscured by political officials and celebrities, according to reports and that's when the crowd became hostile, causing Messi to be whisked away by security after only 20 minutes. This was the opening day of a tour that will see Messi travel to Kolkata, Hyderabad, Mumbai, and New Delhi.An apology to Messi was issued by Mamata Banerjee, the Chief Minister of West Bengal, following the incident.\n\"I am deeply disturbed and shocked by the mismanagement witnessed today at Salt Lake Stadium. I was on my way to the stadium to attend the event along with thousands of sports lovers and fans who had gathered to catch a glimpse of their favourite footballer, Lionel Messi,\" Banerjee posted on X.\"I sincerely apologise to Lionel Messi, as well as to all sports lovers and his fans, for the unfortunate incident.  I am constituting an enquiry committee under the chairmanship of Justice (Retd.) Ashim Kumar Ray, with the Chief Secretary and the Additional Chief Secretary, Home and Hill Affairs Department, as members. The committee will conduct a detailed enquiry into the incident, fix responsibility, and recommend measures to prevent such occurrences in the future.\"\nWith fans spending so much and travelling to see Messi, this unrest has become common over the years, with similar issues happening in Hong Kong last winter when he didn't take part in a friendly during the MLS preseason. Everyone wants a glimpse of Messi, and with the Argentine now 38, the chances to do that during his playing days are dwindling. He'll continue on the rest of the tour of India following this.\n            ",

The Midshipmen (9-2) and Black Knights (6-5) each beat Air Force this season to set up a winner-take-all showdown as the annual round-robin between the service academies concludes with the 126th edition of the Army vs. Navy Game.Navy won last year's battle 31-13 to take hold of the trophy and snap a two-game losing streak against Army. The Black Knights will be hankering for revenge and entering with some momentum after bouncing back from a 1-3 start to win five of their past seven. Navy also enters with some wind at its back after beating AAC stalwarts South Florida in Memphis in its past two games. Another victory would give the Midshipmen back-to-back 10-win seasons for the first time in program history with a bowl game still ahead. Navy is led once again by star quarterback Blake Horvath, a multi-dimensional senior who has already surpassed 1,000 yards passing and 1,000 yards rushing. Army's attack is led by quarterback Cale Hellums, who enters with 1,078 rushing yards and 15 touchdowns. Follow along with live updates, highlights and analysis as the 126th Army vs. Navy Game takes center stage on Saturday.\n        \n            \n                2025 Army vs. Navy Game uniforms: Black Knights, Midshipmen will honor 250 years of service in 126th meeting\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIn the NIL era and mass transfer era, this storied rivalry has become even more distinct than ever before.

Let's take a look.Where to watch Army vs. Navy liveDate: Saturday, Dec. 13 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: M&T Bank Stadium -- Baltimore, MarylandTV: CBS | Live stream: Paramount + Premium, CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App Army vs. Navy: Need to knowHorvath's big game: After three straight games in the series decided by six points or less, Navy's 31-13 victory last season marked a rare lopsided margin in the series. Navy quarterback Blake Horvath totaled more than 300 yards and four touchdowns, shining as both a runner and passer while putting an exclamation point on a breakout season. His 52-yard touchdown pass midway through the third quarter to Eli Heidenreich put Navy ahead 21-10 and proved to be a critical blow.Army's tribute: Army is commemorating the 250th anniversary of the Army's existence by wearing special uniforms that will include purple streaking through the numbers and helmet. It's meant as a tribute to the sacrifices of those who served. The uniform's color will be a marble tint that is designed to symbolize \"the enduring foundation of strength that the American people have provided for the Army.\" The helmets feature the year \"1775\" spelled out on the back.\nNavy's uniform story: Navy's uniform was inspired by the USS Constitution, which is the only remaining frigate from the Navy's original fleet. The vessel known as \"Old Ironsides\" was once used as floating classroom space in the 19th century. It has been out of service since 1881. The \"Old Ironsides\" nickname cam in the War of 1812 when the USS Constitution went undefeated in battle.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        As soon as it seemed like the college football coaching carousel was finally slowing down, Michigan announced it had fired Sherrone Moore for cause after an investigation revealed an inappropriate relationship with a staffer. The Wolverines becoming a late entry to the coaching search fray throws a real wrench in this offseason. We saw a ton of coaches sign fresh contract extensions after turning down openings at Penn State, Florida and Auburn, but Michigan may be a different beast. It is one of the best jobs in the country in terms of resources, and teams with a top-tier coach they haven't locked into an extension already may have to get ready to fight to keep their coach in town. Michigan hired Moore to keep things on track after Jim Harbaugh left for the NFL, but they never quite reached those same heights, falling short of the Playoff in Moore's two seasons at the helm. Getting back to the Playoff and contending for Big Ten championships will be the expectation for another coach, and with Michigan clear of the NCAA investigation into Connor Stalions and the sign-stealing scandal, they should be viewed as one of the nation's top jobs. Who will be Michigan's top candidates after starting a late search? Let's dive into the names they'll be pursuing. \n\n        \n            \n                Michigan's next coach won't just have to win, he must rehab a blue blood's tarnished reputation\n                \n                    Shehan Jeyarajah                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n    \n                                        \n    Kalen DeBoer, Alabama coachDeBoer's been on and off of the hot seat at Alabama, and he is expected to be the top target for the Wolverines. The Crimson Tide snuck into the College Football Playoff as the 9-seed, but after a lopsided loss to Georgia in the SEC title game, there are still skeptics in Tuscaloosa that DeBoer is the right man for the job. The expectations following Nick Saban were always going to be nearly impossible to meet for DeBoer, and if he were looking for a soft landing before the Tide faithful can run him out of town, he'd be hard-pressed to find a better option than Michigan. The Wolverines have tons of financial resources, an elite young quarterback in Bryce Underwood and plenty of desire to close the gap on their hated rivals in Columbus. DeBoer is a midwest guy and might view Michigan as a better long-term fit on a personal level. When he was at Washington, Michigan was always regarded as a spot where DeBoer could jump. Alabama came open first, and here we are. \nAt this point in the carousel, with so many top names inking contract extensions or already taking other jobs, Michigan won't have its pick of the litter as it might in a normal situation. DeBoer represents their best chance to land one of the country's best coaches with experience heading up a Playoff program, and they will likely make a strong run at him. It's worth noting that DeBoer's Alabama buyout would only cost the Wolverines $4 million, according to CBS Sports' Brandon Marcello. The most fascinating thing to watch will be how hard Alabama fights to keep DeBoer in Tuscaloosa. They could certainly match just about any offer Michigan could come up with, but they will have to decide if they want to make that kind of commitment or take a spin around the carousel themselves. \n    \n                                        \n    Marcus Freeman, Notre Dame coachFreeman has been a name floating around a lot this year, and most recently he has been picking up a bunch of buzz about a potential leap to the NFL. It remains to be seen whether he has a desire to take his talents to the professional level, but if Freeman is at all unhappy with his situation at Notre Dame and looking for an exit, Michigan would certainly make for an interesting home. \nIt should be noted that much of Freeman's experience has been at two of Michigan's longtime rivals. He played at Ohio State and has been at Notre Dame since 2021 as defensive coordinator for Brian Kelly for a year before taking over as head coach. We saw with Kelly that a Notre Dame coach can be wooed away by a big contract and promises of a grander financial commitment. Michigan can certainly make that case, but Freeman would have to really be looking for an exit after this year's Playoff snub to bolt for a hated rival (even if they don't play annually anymore). \n    \n                                        \n    Lincoln Riley, USC coachRiley is another name that popped up earlier in the coaching silly season as someone who might be available for the right price, with questions about how hard USC would fight to keep him. \nThat was before Riley and USC put the finishing touches on the nation's No. 1 overall recruiting class, and he would have to leave what appears to be a bright future in L.A. -- and a huge contract -- to make an in-conference jump to Michigan. That said, there was a time where it seemed impossible he'd ever leave Oklahoma before he bolted for Los Angeles.While the Trojans' recruiting class is packed with tantalizing talent, Riley knows better than anyone how vital having an elite quarterback talent is to success. His best years have coincided with Heisman Trophy winning QBs, and if he viewed Underwood as that kind of talent, getting two years with him would be a very tempting opportunity. On top of that, given the investment Michigan made to bring Underwood in, Riley wouldn't have any concerns about whether the Wolverines will pony up to keep the elite talent flowing into Ann Arbor. \n    \n                                        \n    Kenny Dillingham, Arizona State coachDillingham became a hot name in the Michigan coaching search after the turnaround he's orchestrated at Arizona State and the desire from many around Michigan to get some new energy after the various scandals that have plagued the program in recent years. \nThe 35-year-old has gone 22-16 in his three seasons in Tempe, including a Big 12 title in his second season, and has quickly become one of the most highly regarded young coaches in the country. The Sun Devils went from one of the Big 12's worst teams to a conference contender quickly under Dillingham, and even in a season plagued by injuries, the Sun Devils managed an 8-4 record in 2025 under his guidance. While Dillingham has stated his commitment to the Sun Devils numerous times during the 2025 coaching carousel, the Michigan job is one of the most coveted in the country in terms of resources and legacy. That figures to put Dillingham's desire to build something lasting in Tempe to the test, and after declining to pursue jobs in the SEC like Auburn and Florida, Arizona State may have a bigger fight on their hands to keep their coach in the desert. \n    \n                                        \n    Jedd Fisch, Washington coachFisch is finishing up his second season as the coach at Washington, and his name has been linked to a few job openings -- most notably his alma mater, Florida.\nFisch is a true journeyman in the coaching business and has ties to plenty of programs beyond the Gators, including Michigan. He made a two-year stop in Ann Arbor from 2015-16 as the pass-game coordinator and quarterbacks coach under Jim Harbaugh and will likely garner at least some interest from the Wolverines, depending on how things unfold with their dream candidates.After turning things around at Arizona, Fisch has taken Washington to bowl games in back-to-back years and appears to have the Huskies on an upward trajectory as well. The one constant in Fisch's coaching career is changing locales, as his longest tenure was a four-year stint as an offensive assistant with the Ravens in the NFL. That's led many to wonder if he might be looking for his next gig, and Michigan would represent quite the opportunity if it came his way.\n    \n                                        \n    P.J. Fleck, Minnesota coachMinnesota has become a very steady program under Fleck's guidance, but one wonders if he'd be willing to flip to the other side of the Little Brown Jug if Michigan came calling. \nFleck's gone 65-44 in his nine seasons at the helm of the Gophers, missing a bowl game only twice in that span and has made five straight. If Michigan can't pry one of those bigger names away from a marquee program, Fleck could be someone that interests them. We've never seen Fleck at a program with the kinds of resources Michigan has, and he could be intrigued to find out what he could do with that kind of investment. At the same time, there is the risk that he's a program builder but not the kind of coach that maximizes elite talent to the level Michigan hopes. That's the question the Wolverines would have to ask, but if they strike out on the biggest names on their list, they could certainly do much worse than bringing Fleck back to the state of Michigan. \nBrian Kelly, former LSU coachKelly got his start at Grand Valley State before going to Central Michigan, and perhaps the Wolverines will look to bring him back to the Great Lakes State after his dramatic ouster from LSU.Kelly's track record of success speaks for itself with a 297-109-2 career record, but Michigan would have to decide whether he's the kind of culture fit they're looking for. It became quickly evident that Kelly did not mesh well with the folks down at LSU, which is why he found himself out of a job as soon as things turned south. They also would have to decide how much of LSU's struggles this year fell at the feet of Kelly and how much were a larger symptom of a program in a bit of disarray. The Tigers were supposed to be Kelly's next great offense but fell flat, and given Michigan is hoping to find a spark on that side of the ball, that would be a bit of a concern. \nIt would be a fascinating reunion between Kelly and Underwood, who was originally committed to play for Kelly at LSU before getting poached late in the process by the Wolverines.\n    \n                                        \n    Where to get more on the Michigan coaching search If you want all of the latest Michigan news and scoop, there's no better place than TheMichiganInsider.

    "body": "\nRaiders running back Ashton Jeanty is one of the rare rookie running backs selected in the first 10 picks of an NFL Draft who hasn't had a monstrous rookie campaign. However, few running backs have been selected by a team with an offense as dysfunctional as Las Vegas' has been the majority of the season, with the Raiders ranking last in the NFL in scoring at 15.1 points per game. When the Raiders do score, it's often because of Jeanty, and at +175 odds at DraftKings, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model has Jeanty as one of its top values for Week 15 anytime TD scorer bets at online sports betting sites. The model also has a few other top picks for Week 15 anytime touchdown scorer bets, including Chiefs running back Kareem Hunt and Texans wide receiver Jayden Higgins to cash for Week 15 anytime TD scorer bets. Targeting anytime touchdown bets is one way to approach Week 15 NFL betting at online sports betting sites. With NFL props available for almost every player in every game at DraftKings, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model can help you find value to add to your Week 15 NFL picks. Best Week 15 NFL anytime touchdown picks:Ashton Jeanty, Raiders (+175)Kareem Hunt, Chiefs (+120)Jayden Higgins, Texans (+310)\nAshton Jeanty, Raiders (+175)Jeanty played 70% of snaps last week for his sixth straight week reaching that snap percentage. The rookie played 96% of snaps the week before, as Las Vegas' poor record hasn't limited how much it wants to utilize Jeanty. The No. 6 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft is the Raiders' unquestioned top playmaker, and he's accounted for 38.1% of the team's touchdowns this season. The Raiders play the Eagles, who have allowed at least one touchdown to the opposing team's running back in back-to-back weeks, and Jeanty is the only Raiders player with a rushing touchdown this season.\nKareem Hunt, Chiefs (+120)Hunt has continued to play the majority of running back snaps, even with the return of Isiah Pacheco in the last two games. Hunt has played at least 59% of snaps in all five weeks since Pacheco suffered his initial injury, and Hunt has scored at least one touchdown in four of those five contests. He had a 2-yard touchdown run last week for his sixth touchdown over the last six weeks. The Chiefs play the Chargers in a must-win game for Kansas City to keep its postseason hopes alive, and Los Angeles has allowed at least one running back touchdown in two of its last three games. The model projects Hunt to score in more than 50% of simulations, showcasing strong value at plus-money odds. \nJayden Higgins, Texans (+310)Higgins has scored a touchdown in two of his last five games, and he's taken on a more impactful role in the offense in recent weeks. The second-round pick in the 2025 NFL Draft had a slower start, but after seeing more than four targets just once over his first eight games, Higgins has at least five targets in five straight contests, averaging 6.6 targets per game during that stretch. The 22-year-old has more than 40 yards in three of five games after failing to reach that total in any of his first eight games. The Texans are 9.5-point favorites against the Cardinals, who have the 26th-ranked scoring defense in the league, so there should be multiple scoring opportunities. At longer than 3-1 odds, the value sees strong value in Higgins for Week 15 anytime TD scorer bets. \nWant more Week 15 NFL picks?You've seen the model's NFL picks for some top anytime touchdown scorer NFL player props for Week 15.

    "body": "\n        Army and Navy are set to clash once again in one of the most anticipated matchups of each college football season, this year in Baltimore as the storied service academies enter the 126th chapter into their legendary rivalry. The Midshipmen lead the all-time series with a 63-55-7 record against the Black Knights as we enter this year's much-anticipated game.  Both teams are headed to bowl games afterwards, with Army facing UConn in the Fenway Bowl and Navy playing Cincinnati in the Liberty Bowl, but before they enter the postseason, they will face off for bragging rights at M&T Bank Stadium. It's the culmination of a strong year for both programs, but players on both sides know success for the season is often defined by the outcome of the Army-Navy Game.  Army comes in at 6-5, shaking off a slow start to win five of their last seven games to get above .500 heading into its finale with Navy. The Black Knights have found some good form defensively in the back half of the season, allowing 24 points or fewer in six of the last seven games, and their offense has found some footing under first-year starter Cale Hellums.  \n        \n            \n                2025 Army vs. Navy Game uniforms: Black Knights, Midshipmen will honor 250 years of service in 126th meeting\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nOn the other side, Navy has a chance to make some program history, as a win would give it back-to-back 10-win seasons for the first time ever. The Midshipmen ran out to a 7-0 start and looked like a threat to reach the American title game, but a loss to North Texas -- and then Notre Dame -- slowed their momentum some. They bounced back to close the year strong with wins over South Florida and Memphis to enter the Army-Navy Game at 9-2, and have done so courtesy of an explosive offense led by quarterback Blake Horvath. \nFollow along with live updates, highlights and analysis as the 126th Army vs. Navy Game takes center stage on Saturday.Where to watch Army vs. Navy 2025 liveDate: Saturday, Dec. 13 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: M&T Bank Stadium -- Baltimore, MDTV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App, Paramount+ Premium Army vs. Navy 2025: Need to know Which offense can crack some explosive plays? Anyone who has ever watched the Army-Navy Game knows that it will be a grueling, physical battle in the trenches. These are two option teams that know exactly what the other wants to do and have more experience maintaining eye discipline and run fits than any other opponent. That tends to create a low-scoring, field position battle. \nIt's so hard to sustain drives for touchdowns in this game because the defenses are so disciplined against the option, which also means any explosive plays hold extra importance. In that department, Navy has been far better this season. The Midshipmen are fourth in the country in 20+ yard runs (30), while Army is all the way back in 84th (12).  Navy's passing attack has been a far bigger weapon this year compared to Army's, as Horvath has thrown for 1,390 yards and nine touchdowns compared to just 504 yards and three touchdowns for Hellums. No one will confuse the Midshipmen with the Air Raid this season, but Horvath's arm does provide them with an additional threat they can spring on defenses that get too aggressive trying to stop the run.  That doesn't mean Army can't dial up something at the right time to create a chunk play, but the Midshipmen provide a more constant threat for explosives both on the ground and through the air -- as we saw in this game a year ago. Limiting that big play potential will be the biggest challenge for this Black Knights defense that has been extremely solid of late, while the offense will need to find a way to scheme up an explosive or two themselves.  \nSpecial teams matter: Field position is always critical in this matchup, and there tend to be a number of punts as the two teams try to pin the others back deep. Execution from start to finish from the punt units will be paramount. The coverage unit that can execute and pin the other team inside their own 10 can set up their team for success, while a punt block or a muffed return can flip the field and swing the outcome.  Points are at a premium in the Army-Navy Game, and that puts added pressure on the field goal units when they do get trotted out -- although, both teams tend to be aggressive going for it on fourth-and-short situations. Army's Dawson Jones is 12 of 17 on field goal attempts this season and a perfect 29 of 29 on extra points. Navy's Nathan Kirkwood has likewise been perfect on XPs, hitting all 46 he's attempted, and hit 9 of 10 field goal attempts.  It'll be cold and a bit breezy on Saturday afternoon in Baltimore, and the special teams units on both sides will need to be on point.  \nBall is the program: Explosive plays don't just have to happen on offense. Ball security is always of the utmost importance in the Army-Navy Game. Horvath and Hellums will have to be sharp with their ball-handling on the option, both on the give and the pitch, as putting the ball on the ground is the cardinal sin in this game.  For as much as they run the ball and how many pitches and pulls are involved in each play, both of these offenses do a great job protecting the football. Army has lost just five fumbles all year, while Navy has given it away six times. That means it shouldn't be an expectation that either team will cough it up, but any opportunity a defense gets, either on a mishandled option give/pitch or by punching the ball out, could be a huge swing.  Army vs. Navy 2025 prediction, pick  \nSo much points to Navy in this game, but when it comes to this rivalry, it's rarely that simple. The old \"throw out the record books\" adage is firmly in play here, and with the form Army's shown in the second half of the season on defense, I expect it to keep this tight all the way through the fourth quarter. We haven't seen Navy in a defensive, grind-it-out type game since the Rice game in late September, and if history tells us anything, that's what we are in store for on Saturday. \nArmy is going to try and limit possessions and make this a rock fight, and I think the Black Knights can largely be successful. That said, even in a game that's played at that preferred pace, Navy's offense just has more firepower and Horvath can create a couple big plays that make the difference in a win for the Midshipmen.

    "body": "\nThe Baltimore Ravens will be looking for revenge, but the Cincinnati Bengals will be trying to heal their own wounds when the AFC North rivals face off Sunday in NFL Week 15. The Bengals (4-9) pulled off a 32-14 road victory against the Ravens (6-7) two weeks ago as Cincinnati quarterback Joe Burrow returned from injury. But the Bengals are looking to bounce back after Buffalo rallied to beat them 39-34 last Sunday.   Kickoff from Paycor Stadium is set for 1 p.m. ET on CBS and Paramount+. The Ravens are 2.5-point favorites, per the latest Ravens vs. Bengals odds from DraftKings, and the over/under for total points scored is 51.5.

Baltimore is 4-9 against the spread but 5-2 ATS in its past seven games against the Bengals. Both teams have struggled on defense, which is why they are both 8-5 to the Over.

The Bengals have gotten a bit of a boost since Joe Burrow came back, naturally, and Ja'Marr Chase had 110 receiving yards in Week 13. Both defenses are bad, but Lamar Jackson is struggling in the passing game with his tight ends the only pass-catchers he can really count on. The SportsLine Projection Model has this game effectively as a pick 'em, but the Bengals are covering in 51% of simulations and winning outright 47% of the time as a slight money line underdog. The model is leaning slightly to the Over, with that side of the total hitting 52% of the time.Ravens vs. Bengals score prediction: Ravens 28, Bengals 26\nWant more Week 15 NFL picks?You've seen the model's best bets for Baltimore Ravens vs. Cincinnati Bengals.

    "body": "\n        Philip Rivers' return to the gridiron is being fast-tracked, as the Indianapolis Colts have activated the 44-year-old quarterback for their Week 15 road matchup against the Seattle Seahawks. Rivers will start on Sunday, CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones reports, after ending his five-year retirement on Tuesday by signing with the Colts practice squad. Now, he's on the verge of once again being a starting quarterback. The Colts are desperate at quarterback. Daniel Jones suffered a torn Achilles in last Sunday's loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars. Former No. 4 overall pick Anthony Richardson is on injured reserve with an orbital fracture. Rookie Riley Leonard, who was expected to replace Jones in the starting lineup, has a knee injury, but is off the injury report. With the Colts' season on the line at 8-5, they are likely turning to the quarterback that last led them to the playoffs.Rivers spent 16 of his 17 NFL seasons with the Los Angeles Chargers, but his last season came in 2020 with the Colts. He threw for 4,169 yards, 24 touchdowns and 11 interceptions while the Colts went 11-5 and earned a wild card spot. Rivers' final NFL game came on Jan. 9, 2021 -- a 27-24 playoff loss to the Buffalo Bills, in which he completed 27 of 46 passes for 309 yards and two touchdowns. An eight-time Pro Bowler, Rivers went 134-106 as a starter in his incredible career, and ranks seventh all-time in passing yards (63,440) and sixth in touchdown passes (421). Fewer than five months ago, Rivers signed a one-day contract with the Chargers and announced his retirement. The franchise even put out an emotional video. But things have changed and Rivers will be back in an NFL uniform on Sunday in Seattle. \nWhy did the Colts sign Rivers?Why did the Colts go and sign the 44-year-old Rivers instead of a free agent like Ryan Tannehill, or maybe even another NFL legend like Tom Brady? It's likely because Rivers has familiarity with the Colts franchise, coach Shane Steichen and the team's offensive system. Rivers has been a high school football coach at Fairhope (Ala.) St. Michael Catholic, where he coaches his son Gunner Rivers -- who is also a quarterback. CBS Sports broadcaster and NFL legend J.J. Watt recently learned that Rivers ran the same offense as the Colts for his son's team. If you don't believe that, Rivers and Steichen apparently spoke weekly about their scheme, discussing plays and even film. It's a reason why the Colts are expected to start Rivers five days after he rejoined the NFL. \n        \n            \n                Philip Rivers' impossible comeback, Joe Burrow's unrest and what sources are saying around the NFL\n                \n                    Jonathan Jones                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe historical impactIf he starts as expected, Rivers will become the fifth quarterback to start an NFL game at age 44 or older. He adds his name to a list that includes Brady, Vinny Testaverde, Warren Moon and Steve DeBerg. Sunday marks 1,800 days since Rivers' last NFL game, according to CBS Sports Research. It's the longest layoff by a 40-year-old starting quarterback in NFL history. The previous record was DeBerg in 1998 (1,777 days). \nRivers is older than Steichen and Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald, making it the sixth instance since 1950 where a starting quarterback was older than both head coaches in a game. In fact, Rivers is older than 13 NFL head coaches. Rivers has 10 children and is a grandfather. Now, he has been charged with saving the Colts' season. The matchup against SeattleThe Seahawks are a tough matchup for Rivers right off the bat, as Seattle already matched its win total from last season at 10-3 and boasts a ferocious defense. This unit ranks second in the NFL in points per game allowed (17.4), yards per play allowed (4.5) and third-down defense (33%). Seattle has allowed just nine total points over the past two games, and leads the NFL with six non-offensive touchdowns.\nUnfortunately for the Colts, the Week 15 matchup against Seattle isn't the only tough game remaining on the schedule. Indy actually has the toughest remaining schedule in the NFL (.692 opponent win percentage). Three of the Colts' final four opponents rank top seven in the NFL in pressures. WeekOpponent15at Seattle Seahawks16vs. San Francisco 49ers17vs. Jacksonville Jaguars18at Houston TexansColts' chances to make the playoffsWhat are the chances Rivers can come in and deliver for the Colts, stop their slide and get Indy back to the postseason? Let's take a look at what SportsLine's data says:TeamChances to win AFC SouthChances to make playoffsJacksonville Jaguars (9-4)49.6%96.5%Houston Texans (8-5)44.2%86.7%Indianapolis Colts (8-5)6.3%41.8%AFC playoff picture Here is how the AFC looks through 14 weeksSeedTeam1.Denver Broncos (11-2)2.New England Patriots (11-2)3.Jacksonville Jaguars (9-4)4.Pittsburgh Steelers (7-6)5.Los Angeles Chargers (9-4)6.Buffalo Bills (9-4)7.Houston Texans (8-5)***ON THE BUBBLE8.Indianapolis Colts (8-5)9.Baltimore Ravens (6-7)10.Kansas City Chiefs (6-7)11.Miami Dolphins (6-7)12.Cincinnati Bengals (4-9)As the data indicates, losing Jones is a massive blow. But the Colts were crashing even before their quarterback went down. The Colts lost three straight games since starting 8-2, and also lost star cornerback Sauce Gardner (calf) and defensive tackle DeForest Buckner (neck) to injury. Indianapolis is in danger of becoming the first NFL team to start 8-2 or better and miss the playoffs since the 1995 Oakland Raiders, but the Colts are hoping this Hail Mary at quarterback pays immediate dividends. \n            ",

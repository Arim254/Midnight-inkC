    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                WWE\n            \n            \n    \n        The time is now. John Cena is set for his WWE farewell as part of Saturday Night's Main Event. The legendary wrestler completes a year-long goodbye to professional wrestling in Washington D.C. when he takes on Gunther in his final match in active competition. Gunther stood tall at the end of a 16-man tournament featuring superstars from Raw, SmackDown, NXT, and surprise opponents from Cena's past. After losing the world heavyweight title to Jey Uso at WrestleMania 41, Gunther had an odd year. He lost his mind as fans taunted him for tapping out against Uso and attacked both Michael Cole and Pat McAfee, which led to a match with McAfee at Backlash. Gunther then beat Uso in a rematch to reclaim the world heavyweight title before a detour to take on a retiring Goldberg. Gunther then dropped the world heavyweight title at SummerSlam before going on hiatus for multiple injuries.Cena's final year has been up and down with some incredible highs and a couple forgettable lows. He began the year by coming up short in the Royal Rumble when it was down to him and Jey Uso. Then, the infamous heel turn at the Elimination Chamber when Cena joined forces with The Rock and Travis Scott to beat down Cody Rhodes after earning his spot at WrestleMania. Cena then beat Rhodes at the event to break the record of most recognized championships at 17. After the title run and subsequent face turn came the return of Brock Lesnar to the fold where he and Cena faced off at Wrestlepalooza. Cena has also had fun throwback matches with CM Punk and AJ Styles along the way.Saturday night's card will also feature three matches between talents from Raw and SmackDown against talents from NXT, as one of Cena's final requests from the promotion was to showcase the future talent of the business against the top stars of today. That includes undisputed WWE champion Cody Rhodes taking on NXT champion Oba Femi, AJ Styles and Dragon Lee in tag team action against Je'Von Evans and Leon Slater as well as Bayley taking on Sol Ruca.Below is how you can catch all the action on Saturday night.\nWhere to watch 2025 WWE Saturday Night's Main EventDate: Saturday, Dec. 13, 2025Location: Capital One Arena -- Washington, D.C.Start time: 8 p.m. ETWatch live: Peacock (subscription required)2025 WWE Saturday Night's Main Event match cardJohn Cena vs. GuntherCody Rhodes vs. Oba FemiBayley vs. Sol RucaAJ Styles & Dragon Lee vs. Je'Von Evans & Leon Slater\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Brandon Royval and Manel Kape want the next shot at UFC flyweight champion Joshua Van. Royval and Kape have an important audition on their hands at UFC Fight Night on Saturday, the final event of 2025 before UFC moves to Paramount+.Royval (17-8) is the most exciting flyweight contender around. He holds the solo record for most Fight of the Night bonuses in the division's history, and is tied for most flyweight performance bonuses. \"Raw Dog\" is kicking himself for his recent loss to Van, a Fight of the Year frontrunner. On one hand, Royval wants to mature into a more thoughtful fighter. On the other hand, he wants to see if Kape has what it takes to survive a firefight.\"It depends on how I show up. I want to be smart and tactical, but my gut feeling is to put Manel Kape in a fight and see what the f-- is up with him,\" Royval told CBS Sports. \"I feel he hasn't been in a real fight in the UFC. No one has tested that part of him. In a fistfight, I bet on myself over the entire world. I bet I can outwill him. That's for damn sure.\"I fought Joshua Van as dumb as I could fight somebody. I knew I would do that. I wanted to box him in the pocket. I wanted to prove something. It didn't work out necessarily. That being said, I want to out-technique Manel Kape, but if it ends up in a fist fight, there's nothing wrong with that either.\"\nKape (21-7) warns Royval to think twice about brawling with him. Kape is one knockout away from tying the record for most divisional history. His precision is reflected in the statistics: better striking accuracy, defense, and takedown defense than Royval. Kape has won six of his last seven fights, and a win over Royval (No. 2) could put him in the perfect position to earn the next shot at Van.\"I've been [studying] Brandon Royval a lot. To me, it's like I'm  fighting someone familiar,\" Kape told reporters on Wednesday. \"In training, everybody wants to look like  Brandon Royval, imitate him, for me it's (the) usual. I'll be very comfortable on Saturday night.\"I'm just going to prove that I'm the man. I'm the fighter with the  better style to be a champion. I'm the fighter that this division  needs.\"  \nCheck out the full interview with Brandon Royval below.\nLet's take a look at the rest of the fight card with the latest odds before getting to a prediction and expert pick on the main event below.UFC Fight Night card, oddsOdds via DraftKings SportsbookFavoriteUnderdogWeightclassManel Kape -140Brandon Royval +100FlyweightKevin Vallejos -340Giga Chikadze +270FeatherweightCezary Oleksiejczuk -205Cesar Almeida +170  MiddleweightMelquizael Costa -125Morgan Charriere +105FeatherweightKennedy Nzechukwu -192Marcus Buchecha +110HeavyweightKing Green -192Lance Gibson Jr. +160  160-pound catchweightUFC Fight Night viewing informationDate: Dec. 13 | Start time: 10 p.m. ETLocation: UFC Apex -- Las VegasTV Channel: ESPN2 | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)  PredictionBrandon Royval vs. Manel Kape: Kape has never fought five rounds. His closest experience is a fourth-round submission win on the regional scene 10 years ago. Royval puts opponents in deep waters and edges out decisions. Just ask Tatsuro Taira, who Royval beat by split decision last year. The terms for Saturday's fight benefit Royval more than his opponent. The question is how much success will Kape have early in the fight. He's more powerful and technically proficient than Royval statistically. Royval's wrestling has improved, but it hasn't been his bread and butter. A textbook \"Raw Dog\" brawl is Royval's best chance to win. However, I worry Royval's chin gets cracked in the process, or he loses too many rounds early to cover ground late. Pick: Kape via KO3\n            ",

Saturday's games count toward the regular-season standings, but the title game will not.The eight-team knockout stage began earlier this week. The Thunder improved to 24-1 with a blowout win over the Suns on Wednesday. They tied the 2015-16 Warriors for the best 25-game start in NBA history and handed the Suns their worst loss in franchise history (49 points). The Spurs, meanwhile, took care of Luka Dončić, LeBron James and the Lakers without Victor Wembanyama. It remains to be seen if Wemby, who has missed a month with a calf strain, will suit up for the semifinal tilt against OKC.In the East, the Magic and Knicks were both victorious on Tuesday night. The Magic rallied after giving up the first 15 points to the Heat to come back and defeat their in-state rival. The Knicks got 35 points from Jalen Brunson in a road win against the Raptors. The Thunder are currently the favorites to win the 2025 NBA Cup (-225 at FanDuel).

    "body": "\n        Liverpool were able to get back to their winning ways in the Premier League, defeating Brighton 2-0 at Anfield on Saturday. A brace from Hugo Ekitike was enough to keep Liverpool in front of Brighton, but the second goal was a significant one due to it being assisted by Mohamed Salah following his whirlwind week with the club. Following positive discussions with Arne Slot, Salah was included in the squad and got called upon much earlier than many would've expected, as Joe Gomez left the match due to an injury, and Salah was introduced in the 22nd minute of play. It wasn't a vintage performance by any sense of the term, with him taking three shots and netting an assist, but after claiming that the club wants to push him out and that he's been thrown under the bus, any contribution is more than what was expected.\nSalah will now depart to join the Egyptian national team for the Africa Cup of Nations, but manager Arne Slot expects him to come back to the club at the conclusion of the tournament amid transfer speculation. \"Actions speak louder than what I can say about it, [Salah] was here, so that tells you how the conversation yesterday went, and he was the first substitute I made, so that already gives an answer to all the questions that you have,\" Slot said following the match.\"He goes to the AFCON, and we have a lot of games to play and yeah, he's a Liverpool player, so I expect him to be back afterwards.\"\nWith interest from the Saudi Premier League, there is wonder of where Salah will play his soccer once the January transfer window opens, but if his manager is to be believed, it will be at Liverpool. Granted, there isn't much else that Slot can say publicly, but after Salah was benched in three consecutive matches and left out of the squad for their 1-0 victory over Inter in Champions League play midweek, this is an improvement.Fans also chanted Salah's name following the full-time whistle as he was the last player to leave the pitch at Anfield. It wasn't a moment that read as a goodbye from Liverpool, but it was something that was meaningful for him.\nThat was Salah's third Premier League assist of the season and one that helped showcase the breakout that Ekitike is having for the Reds. He now has seven goals in the league, and in a season that has seen Salah's scoring dip while Alexander Isak and Florian Wirtz have struggled to integrate into the side, his performances have been a silver lining for Liverpool.\nWithout Salah, Ekitike will be relied on, but if the Reds can get the two of them going together following AFCON, there could be hope for the season with Salah's future looking a little more red than last week.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza won the 2025 Heisman Trophy as the most outstanding player in college football. He beat out Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia, Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love and Ohio State quarterback Julian Sayin for the honor. The Hoosiers' signal caller earned 643 first-place votes, 191 second-place votes and 51 third-place votes. Pavia finished second with 189 first-place votes, 352 second-place votes and 164 for third. Mendoza came from humble beginnings, rated as the No. 134 quarterback in the Class of 2022. Before he earned a late offer from California, he was set to go to Yale and play in the Ivy League. Even after arriving in Berkeley, he had to battle for the starting job each season before finally settling in and breaking out as a sophomore. \n        \n            \n                Who will be at forefront of 2026 Heisman race?

Instead of choosing a traditional power, he was sold on Indiana coach Curt Cignetti, offensive coordinator Mike Shanahan and a rising program in Bloomington. His brother Alberto was also a quarterback at the school, but the addition of Fernando proved to be one of the greatest in program history.\nDuring Indiana's historic run to the No. 1 overall seed in the College Football Playoff, Mendoza was sensational. The junior completed 71.5% of his passes for 2,980 yards and led college football with 33 passing touchdowns. The Hoosiers won the Big Ten outright for the first time since 1945 with a perfect 13-0 record. Unlike nearly every other candidate, Mendoza had multiple Heisman moments. In a 27-24 comeback win against Penn State, he led a game-winning drive and connected with Omar Cooper on an acrobatic touchdown that will be replayed for years. In the Big Ten Championship Game against Ohio State, he took a third-down snap and hit Charlie Becker for a 33-yard pass that helped the Hoosiers run out the clock in a 13-10 upset. \nNow, the Heisman winner prepares to take Indiana into the CFP. The Hoosiers play the winner of No. 8 Oklahoma and No. 9 Alabama in the Rose Bowl on New Year's Day. Indiana has never won a national championship.  \nSurprisingly, Mendoza is the first Heisman Trophy winner to play in the CFP since Alabama's Bryce Young in 2021. Young led the Crimson Tide to the national title game before falling just short to rival Georgia. Between 2014 and 2021, seven of the eight Heisman winners earned a trip to the CFP.  Mendoza is also the first Big Ten player to win the Heisman Trophy since Ohio State's Troy Smith in 2006, and just the second in the 21st Century. USC and Oregon have produced a combined five Heismans since 2000, but all came while members of the Pac-12. Indiana has not produced a Heisman finalist since running back Anthony Thompson in 1989. 2025 Heisman Trophy voting    RankPlayerSchool1st2nd3rdTotal points1Fernando MendozaIndiana643191512,3622Diego PaviaVanderbilt1893521641,4353Jeremiyah LoveNotre Dame461572677194Julian SayinOhio State81181724325Jacob RodriguezTexas Tech17561322956Jeremiah SmithOhio State4183684 Elevating the Hoosiers Indiana reached the College Football Playoff last season, but lost by double-digits against Notre Dame as the offense struggled to create opportunities. Statistically, the unit hasn't been much different in 2025. Against elite competition, though, Mendoza has proven to be a significant upgrade.  \nIn historic wins over No. 1 Ohio State and No. 3 Oregon, Mendoza completed 65% of his passes and averaged 8.1 yards per attempt against two of the best defenses in college football. He completed the game-changing 33-yard pass against Ohio State to run out the clock. Total stats tell part of the story, but his ascension in key moments has been the difference between excellent and national caliber at Indiana.  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Philip Rivers' return to the gridiron is being fast-tracked, as the Indianapolis Colts have activated the 44-year-old quarterback for their Week 15 road matchup against the Seattle Seahawks. Rivers will start on Sunday, CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones reports, after ending his five-year retirement on Tuesday by signing with the Colts practice squad. Now, he's on the verge of once again being a starting quarterback. The Colts are desperate at quarterback. Daniel Jones suffered a torn Achilles in last Sunday's loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars. Former No. 4 overall pick Anthony Richardson is on injured reserve with an orbital fracture. Rookie Riley Leonard, who was expected to replace Jones in the starting lineup, has a knee injury, but is off the injury report. With the Colts' season on the line at 8-5, they are likely turning to the quarterback that last led them to the playoffs.Rivers spent 16 of his 17 NFL seasons with the Los Angeles Chargers, but his last season came in 2020 with the Colts. He threw for 4,169 yards, 24 touchdowns and 11 interceptions while the Colts went 11-5 and earned a wild card spot. Rivers' final NFL game came on Jan. 9, 2021 -- a 27-24 playoff loss to the Buffalo Bills, in which he completed 27 of 46 passes for 309 yards and two touchdowns. An eight-time Pro Bowler, Rivers went 134-106 as a starter in his incredible career, and ranks seventh all-time in passing yards (63,440) and sixth in touchdown passes (421). Fewer than five months ago, Rivers signed a one-day contract with the Chargers and announced his retirement. The franchise even put out an emotional video. But things have changed and Rivers will be back in an NFL uniform on Sunday in Seattle. \nWhy did the Colts sign Rivers?Why did the Colts go and sign the 44-year-old Rivers instead of a free agent like Ryan Tannehill, or maybe even another NFL legend like Tom Brady? It's likely because Rivers has familiarity with the Colts franchise, coach Shane Steichen and the team's offensive system. Rivers has been a high school football coach at Fairhope (Ala.) St. Michael Catholic, where he coaches his son Gunner Rivers -- who is also a quarterback. CBS Sports broadcaster and NFL legend J.J. Watt recently learned that Rivers ran the same offense as the Colts for his son's team. If you don't believe that, Rivers and Steichen apparently spoke weekly about their scheme, discussing plays and even film. It's a reason why the Colts are expected to start Rivers five days after he rejoined the NFL. \n        \n            \n                Philip Rivers' impossible comeback, Joe Burrow's unrest and what sources are saying around the NFL\n                \n                    Jonathan Jones                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe historical impactIf he starts as expected, Rivers will become the fifth quarterback to start an NFL game at age 44 or older. He adds his name to a list that includes Brady, Vinny Testaverde, Warren Moon and Steve DeBerg. Sunday marks 1,800 days since Rivers' last NFL game, according to CBS Sports Research. It's the longest layoff by a 40-year-old starting quarterback in NFL history. The previous record was DeBerg in 1998 (1,777 days). \nRivers is older than Steichen and Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald, making it the sixth instance since 1950 where a starting quarterback was older than both head coaches in a game. In fact, Rivers is older than 13 NFL head coaches. Rivers has 10 children and is a grandfather. Now, he has been charged with saving the Colts' season. The matchup against SeattleThe Seahawks are a tough matchup for Rivers right off the bat, as Seattle already matched its win total from last season at 10-3 and boasts a ferocious defense. This unit ranks second in the NFL in points per game allowed (17.4), yards per play allowed (4.5) and third-down defense (33%). Seattle has allowed just nine total points over the past two games, and leads the NFL with six non-offensive touchdowns.\nUnfortunately for the Colts, the Week 15 matchup against Seattle isn't the only tough game remaining on the schedule. Indy actually has the toughest remaining schedule in the NFL (.692 opponent win percentage). Three of the Colts' final four opponents rank top seven in the NFL in pressures. WeekOpponent15at Seattle Seahawks16vs. San Francisco 49ers17vs. Jacksonville Jaguars18at Houston TexansColts' chances to make the playoffsWhat are the chances Rivers can come in and deliver for the Colts, stop their slide and get Indy back to the postseason? Let's take a look at what SportsLine's data says:TeamChances to win AFC SouthChances to make playoffsJacksonville Jaguars (9-4)49.6%96.5%Houston Texans (8-5)44.2%86.7%Indianapolis Colts (8-5)6.3%41.8%AFC playoff picture Here is how the AFC looks through 14 weeksSeedTeam1.Denver Broncos (11-2)2.New England Patriots (11-2)3.Jacksonville Jaguars (9-4)4.Pittsburgh Steelers (7-6)5.Los Angeles Chargers (9-4)6.Buffalo Bills (9-4)7.Houston Texans (8-5)***ON THE BUBBLE8.Indianapolis Colts (8-5)9.Baltimore Ravens (6-7)10.Kansas City Chiefs (6-7)11.Miami Dolphins (6-7)12.Cincinnati Bengals (4-9)As the data indicates, losing Jones is a massive blow. But the Colts were crashing even before their quarterback went down. The Colts lost three straight games since starting 8-2, and also lost star cornerback Sauce Gardner (calf) and defensive tackle DeForest Buckner (neck) to injury. Indianapolis is in danger of becoming the first NFL team to start 8-2 or better and miss the playoffs since the 1995 Oakland Raiders, but the Colts are hoping this Hail Mary at quarterback pays immediate dividends. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Arizona State and coach Kenny Dillingham are working toward an agreement on an updated contract as speculation swirls around his potential candidacy for the opening at Michigan, according to 247Sports. The two sides are \"close\" to reaching an agreement for a new deal, which would include an increase to his annual base salary.Dillingham confirmed after practice Saturday that Arizona State and his agent began working on contract amendments shortly after the conclusion of the regular season. The talks between athletic director Graham Rossini and Dillingham's agent have continued over the past two weeks, per 247Sports. The discussions, which took on added urgency following Michigan's firing of Sherrone Moore earlier this week, are focused on increasing Dillingham's guaranteed compensation and making his contract less dependent on performance-based incentives. Dillingham said Saturday he has not spoken with Michigan or any other programs regarding coaching vacancies.Dillingham had already triggered an automatic $200,000 raise by winning eight regular-season games, which would increase his 2025 base salary from $5.8 million to $6 million, along with an automatic one-year extension through Dec. 31, 2030. Any amended contract would need approval from the Arizona Board of Regents.\n        \n            \n                Michigan coaching candidates: Kalen DeBoer, Kenny Dillingham among options after sudden Sherrone Moore firing\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDillingham is an Arizona State alum: 'This is home'Dillingham was on the practice field Saturday as Arizona State prepared for the Sun Bowl against Duke on Dec. 31. The practice session, originally scheduled for 9 a.m. local time, was moved to 10:45 a.m.\nAfter practice, Dillingham was asked what makes coaching at Arizona State special. He paused for 20 seconds and became visibly emotional, with tears in his eyes, before answering.\"I love this place,\" Dillingham said. \"It's a special place to me.\"\nDillingham, 35, a Scottsdale native and Arizona State alumnus, has repeatedly expressed a desire to remain with the Sun Devils. Following the Nov. 15 win against West Virginia, amid swirling coaching rumors, he told reporters, \"I was never leaving,\" according to 247Sports.\"This is home,\" Dillingham said. \"But you do have to continue to push, and my job in running a program is to push and push and push until you can't push any more. If I didn't do that, I'd be cheating my players, I'd be cheating my staff, I'd be cheating my fanbase, I'd be cheating everyone in this city, I'd be cheating the local businesses that feed off us winning, I'd be cheating everyone. So my No. 1 goal, always, is to do whatever I can to push the envelope for Arizona State football.\"\nDillingham's potential long-term stay is influenced in part by family. He and his wife, Briana, both Arizona State graduates, are expecting their second child early next year, and his parents and in-laws live nearby. \"Having the family support here is a really cool thing,\" Dillingham said in an early November interview, noting that the proximity allows him to focus on the program.Since taking over as coach in 2023, Dillingham has helped elevate Arizona State to national relevance. The Sun Devils, coming off a Big 12 Championship and the program's first College Football Playoff berth in 2024, have posted a 19-7 record since the start of his second season. That Big 12 title came after the Sun Devils were picked to finish last in the conference in the preseason.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The most prestigious award in college football will be handed out Saturday night as four of the top athletes in the nation descend upon New York City for the 2025 Heisman Trophy ceremony. Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza is seen as the favorite to capture the prize after leading the Hoosiers to their best season in program history, but he will have stiff competition from other top signal callers from around the sport. Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia, Ohio State quarterback Julian Sayin and Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love round out the list of four finalists that will take the stage inside the Lincoln Center's Appel Room. Mendoza and Sayin are gearing up for an appearance in the College Football Playoff after dueling in the Big Ten Championship Game, which Indiana won to capture its first outright conference title in 80 years. Pavia and Love, obviously, had successful seasons while starring for a pair of 10-win programs. The odds favor another quarterback winning the Heisman after Colorado two-way star Travis Hunter earned the award last season. Hunter's triumph snapped a streak of three straight quarterback Heisman winners. A quarterback also won the Heisman seven times from 2016-23. The 2025 Heisman Trophy ceremony will begin at 7 p.m. ET and air on ESPN. It can also be streamed live on fuboTV (Try for free).  \nOdds in parentheses below via DraftKings Sportsbook.2025 Heisman Trophy finalists, oddsFernando Mendoza, QB, Indiana (-2500): Mendoza took a commanding lead in the Heisman standings following a heroic performance in the Big Ten Championship Game. He completed 15 of his 23 pass attempts for 222 yards and the decisive 17-yard touchdown to wide receiver Elijah Sarratt. Mendoza leads the nation with 33 touchdowns passing to just six interceptions and he's also rushed for another six touchdowns on the ground. He would be the first Heisman Trophy winner in Indiana history. Diego Pavia, QB, Vanderbilt (+1100): Like Mendoza, Pavia can make history as Vanderbilt's first Heisman recipient. He's already lead the Commodores to their first 10-win season in program history, capped by their first victory against Tennessee since 2018. Pavia's established himself as one of the most electric playmakers in the country. He averaged 465.5 total yards per game and scored 16 total touchdowns in Vanderbilt's final four games. Jeremiyah Love, RB, Notre Dame (+25000): Love is holding it down as the only non-quarterback that made the cut as a Heisman finalist. It's not hard to see why. He almost singlehandedly provided the offensive firepower for a Notre Dame team that just missed out on the College Football Playoff. He was one of just two players to average at least 6.9 yards per carry while toting the rock over 150 times. His 18 touchdowns rushing also ranked third in the FBS. \nJulian Sayin, QB, Ohio State (+50000): Sayin is a smooth operator in Ohio State's explosive offense. His 78.4% completion percentage leads the nation and his 182.1 passer rating is first among FBS quarterbacks with at least 100 pass attempts on the year. He failed to complete 70% of his passes in just two games all season. Though Ohio State's elite skill position players get a lot of credit for Sayin's success, his own talent is evident with his ability to deliver the ball accurately to every level of the field. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        One of the most-anticipated games of the season has finally arrived, and the winner of the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy will be solidified as Army and Navy renew their storied rivalry on CBS to cap college football's regular season. The Midshipmen (9-2) and Black Knights (6-5) each beat Air Force this season to set up a winner-take-all showdown as the annual round-robin between the service academies concludes with the 126th edition of the Army vs. Navy Game.Navy won last year's battle 31-13 to take hold of the trophy and snap a two-game losing streak against Army. The Black Knights will be hankering for revenge and entering with some momentum after bouncing back from a 1-3 start to win five of their past seven. Navy also enters with some wind at its back after beating AAC stalwarts South Florida in Memphis in its past two games. Another victory would give the Midshipmen back-to-back 10-win seasons for the first time in program history with a bowl game still ahead. Navy is led once again by star quarterback Blake Horvath, a multi-dimensional senior who has already surpassed 1,000 yards passing and 1,000 yards rushing. Army's attack is led by quarterback Cale Hellums, who enters with 1,078 rushing yards and 15 touchdowns. Follow along with live updates, highlights and analysis as the 126th Army vs. Navy Game takes center stage on Saturday.\n        \n            \n                2025 Army vs. Navy Game uniforms: Black Knights, Midshipmen will honor 250 years of service in 126th meeting\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIn the NIL era and mass transfer era, this storied rivalry has become even more distinct than ever before. Athletes at service academies do not make NIL money and transfer at a significantly lower rate than those at mainstream schools. They play for the love of the game, and there is no bigger game than Army vs. Navy.\nWhat should you expect next Saturday? Let's take a look.Where to watch Army vs. Navy liveDate: Saturday, Dec. 13 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: M&T Bank Stadium -- Baltimore, MarylandTV: CBS | Live stream: Paramount + Premium, CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App Army vs. Navy: Need to knowHorvath's big game: After three straight games in the series decided by six points or less, Navy's 31-13 victory last season marked a rare lopsided margin in the series. Navy quarterback Blake Horvath totaled more than 300 yards and four touchdowns, shining as both a runner and passer while putting an exclamation point on a breakout season. His 52-yard touchdown pass midway through the third quarter to Eli Heidenreich put Navy ahead 21-10 and proved to be a critical blow.Army's tribute: Army is commemorating the 250th anniversary of the Army's existence by wearing special uniforms that will include purple streaking through the numbers and helmet. It's meant as a tribute to the sacrifices of those who served. The uniform's color will be a marble tint that is designed to symbolize \"the enduring foundation of strength that the American people have provided for the Army.\" The helmets feature the year \"1775\" spelled out on the back.\nNavy's uniform story: Navy's uniform was inspired by the USS Constitution, which is the only remaining frigate from the Navy's original fleet. The vessel known as \"Old Ironsides\" was once used as floating classroom space in the 19th century. It has been out of service since 1881. The \"Old Ironsides\" nickname cam in the War of 1812 when the USS Constitution went undefeated in battle.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        During the final minutes of regulation of Kansas' game vs. NC State on Saturday, Jayhawks star Darryn Peterson -- the projected No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NBA Draft -- checked out of the game twice. Peterson, who returned last weekend against Missouri after missing his team's previous seven games due to a hamstring injury, appeared to reaggravate the injury. \"I think he was getting tight,\" Kansas coach Bill Self said postgame. \"I haven't talked to the doctor yet or the trainer, but he said he needed to come out.\" Even without Peterson down the stretch, Kansas walked away with a dramatic 77-76 overtime upset win over NC State on Saturday, in one of the best games of the 2025-26 season thus far. The hero for Kansas was Melvin Council Jr., who scored a career-high 36 points and knocked down nine 3-pointers. One of the biggest questions coming into the season for the Jayhawks was how they would perform in the non-Peterson minutes. Without Peterson in the lineup, Kansas went 5-2, with the lone losses coming against Duke and UConn. Council provided the exact spark Kansas needed to pull off a win. \n\n        \n            \n                College basketball rankings: No. 5 UConn moves to 10-1, finishes nonconference slate with win over Texas\n                \n                    Gary Parrish                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDepending on how serious the injury is, Kansas could have to weather the storm once again without its star freshman. In the Big Ten, one of the stories of the college basketball season is brewing. Nebraska improved to 11-0 for the first time in program history after recording an 83-80 upset win over No. 13 Illinois. Nebraska guard Jamarques Lawrence knocked down a 3-pointer with 0.2 seconds remaining to give No. 23 Nebraska its first ranked win of the season. Here are the biggest winners and losers of Saturday's college basketball slate. \n    \n                                        \n     Winner: Kentucky shows signs of life Kentucky officially has a pulse for the first time this season after riding a ruthless defensive and rebounding effort to a desperately needed 72-60 win over Indiana. The win was UK's first against an opponent in the top 200 of the NET after the Wildcats started 0-4 against high-major opponents. Kentucky's offensive issues still need to be solved, but Saturday's win over IU gave the entire state a chance to exhale.  \nIn his return after missing five games with an ankle sprain, Mo Dioubate set the tone with 14 points and 12 rebounds, including seven offensive rebounds that spurred the Wildcats to an 18-6 edge in second-chance points. UK limited the Hoosiers to just 27.3% shooting in the second half and used a 23-6 edge in points off turnovers to build its lead. The Wildcats still have a long way to go, but this was an important first step. – David Cobb \n\n    \n                                        \n     Winner: Council has his moment for Kansas Last season, Council connected on just 29.9% of his 3-pointers on just under four attempts per game. Coming into the weekend, the Kansas guard was shooting 18.5% from beyond the arc -- the worst percentage of his college career thus far. However, that didn't matter against NC State. With Peterson out, Council took over down the stretch and helped Kansas pull off the upset over NC State. Every time Kansas needed a bucket, Council was the guy. The Jayhawks are going to need that kind of production if Peterson misses extended time. -- Cameron Salerno \n\n    \n                                        \n     Loser: Divine intervention kills Penn State Michigan State guard Divine Ugochukwu scored a career-high 23 points to help rally the No. 9 Spartans back from a 9-point deficit to beat Penn State 76-72. The sophomore Miami transfer scored 18 in the second half alone, including five in the final minute. Ugochukwu drilled all four of his 3-point attempts in the second half, including two that gave Michigan State the lead. Without Divine's intervention, the Spartans may have ended up on the wrong side of an upset. -- Cobb \n\n    \n                                        \n    Winner: Gonzaga vs. UCLA lives up to the hypeGonzaga vs. UCLA has become one of the best rivalries in college basketball. Every time the West Coast foes face off -- whether it be at home, a neutral site, and/or the NCAA Tournament -- college basketball fans can expect a banger of a game. Despite some people being asleep on the East Coast by the time this game tipped off on Saturday night, fans who did stay up were treated to another epic showdown.Outside of the blowout loss to Michigan last month, Gonzaga has been playing like a top-five team. The No. 8 Bulldogs picked up an 82-72 win over No. 25 UCLA, which marked their fourth win over a ranked opponent this season. Gonzaga now has wins over Creighton, Oklahoma, Alabama, Kentucky and UCLA.\n\n    \n                                        \n     Winner: Rick Pitino takes down former team Hall of Fame coach Rick Pitino led his No. 22 St. John's Red Storm to a 91-64 win over his former team, the Iona Gaels, inside Madison Square Garden on Saturday. Pitino led Iona from 2021-2023 before leaving for the St. John's gig in the Big East, and while he didn't exactly call off the dogs in the blowout, he was gracious in victory postgame speaking of his former employer. \n\"Iona's got a really good team,\" Pitino said, noting the school helped \"rejuvenate\" his coaching career.. \"Iona's such a special place with great tradition. I owe them so much. We're going to play this game every year that I'm the coach.\"  The win was a tune-up for the Johnnies as they begin conference play at home Tuesday vs. DePaul. -- Kyle Boone \n    \n                                        \n     Loser: West Virginia squanders a big lead West Virginia looked primed to earn the first big win of coach Ross Hodge's tenure as it built a 16-point second-half lead against border foe Ohio State. But the Buckeyes regained their footing and dealt the Mountaineers a devastating blow by emerging with an 89-88 double-overtime win. A deep cast of characters made critical contributions for Ohio State, but star guard Bruce Thornton was the hero in the end. His physical drive and score with 3.3 seconds left in double-overtime proved to be the game winner.  \n\n    \n                                        \n     Loser: Florida State meets match vs. UMass Year 1 of the Luke Loucks era at his alma mater got off to a fantastic start. FSU began the season by winning five of its first six games, with the lone loss coming against reigning national champion Florida by two points. Since defeating Cal State Bakersfield last month, FSU has lost four consecutive games, including a 103-95 loss to UMass. The Seminoles were a double-digit favorite over the Minutemen. With ACC play beginning at the end of the month against North Carolina, the Seminoles have some stuff to clean up. -- Salerno \n    \n                                        \n     Loser: Creighton's freefall continues Losing star center Ryan Kalkbrenner after five seasons was always going to require Creighton to recalibrate. But life in the post-Kalkbrenner era is proving even more difficult than expected, as Saturday's 83-76 home loss to Kansas State dropped the Bluejays to 5-5. Creighton nearly erased a 20-point deficit behind a strong second half performance from junior forward Isaac Traudt, who scored 15 of his team-high 18 points after the break. But a late 6-0 run from the Wildcats ensured that Creighton's miserable start to the season continued. The Bluejays need to find some solutions fast if they are going to keep their streak of five straight NCAA Tournament appearances alive.  -- Cobb \n\n    \n                                        \n     Winner: Arkansas gets payback over Texas Tech One of the biggest collapses of the 2025 NCAA Tournament featured Arkansas squandering a 16-point lead to Texas Tech in the Sweet 16. The Red Raiders went on to win in dramatic fashion, which saw Year 1 of the John Calipari era at Arkansas end sourly. Just over eight months later, Arkansas got revenge with a 93-86 win over Texas Tech behind a monster performance from veteran big man Trevon Brazile. Arkansas now has ranked wins on the season over Louisville and Texas Tech. -- Salerno \n\n    \n                                        \n     Loser: Providence on wrong side of thriller If Saturday's clash between Butler and Providence was any indication, life in the Big East is going to be rugged. In the first league battle of the season, the Bulldogs outlasted the Friars 113-110 in double overtime. The game featured a whopping 30 lead changes, and neither squad ever led by more than eight. In the end, Butler's Finley Bizjack scored 12 of his 26 points after regulation to lead the Bulldogs through a frenzied finish. Jason Edwards and Jaylin Sellers combined to score 58 for Providence in a crushing defeat to begin league play. -- Cobb \n\n    \n                                        \n     Winner: Louisville goes nuts vs. Memphis No. 11 Louisville took mercy on Memphis in the second half of a 99-73 win by slowing down the barrage of 3-pointers that it used to build an insurmountable lead. Over a span of less than five minutes late in the half, the Cards drilled seven in a row from beyond the arc to extend an 8-point lead to 20. By the end of the first half, Louisville was 12 of 22 from deep and on pace to shatter the school record of 22 made 3-pointers. But the Cards attempted just five 3-pointers over the final 11 minutes to finish 18 of 35. It marked just the third time in program history and first time since 2008-09 that Louisville hit 18 or more 3-pointers in a game while shooting better than 50% from beyond the arc. \nThe variety in contributors stood out, as six different Louisville players made at least two apiece. Among them was reserve big Kasean Pryor. Though he entered just 1 of 7 from deep on the season, Pryor hit three triples in a span of just over two minutes late in the first half. Even pass attempts were going in for the Cardinals, who improved to 9-1 ahead of Tuesday's trip to Tennessee. -- Cobb \n\n    \n                                        \n     Winner: Lawrence is the hero in Nebraska's historic win One of the best endings of the day in college basketball came in Champaign, Illinois, when No. 23 Nebraska used a game-winning 3-pointer by Lawrence to stay unbeaten. Lawrence's shot with 0.2 seconds remaining gave his team an 83-80 win over No. 13 Illinois. The Cornhuskers are now 11-0 for the first time in program history and 2-0 against Big Ten competition. The win over the Fighting Illini was Nebraska's first victory over a ranked opponent thus far.  -- Salerno \n\n    \n                                        \n     Winner: Florida shakes off skid vs. George Washington The defending national champion Florida Gators snapped a two-game losing skid with a confidence-boosting 80-70 win over George Washington in Sunrise, Florida. Florida had lost three of its last four games and was 5-4 entering the day, but against the Revolutionaries they largely controlled the game throughout. \nThat was due in part to a second-half shooting showcase in which Florida shot 66.7% from the field and built a lead by as many as 20 points. Transfer guard Xaivian Lee led all scorers with 24 points in that effort, and forward Alex Condon led the team with seven assists and nine rebounds. -- Boone \n    \n                                        \n     Winner: Oscar Cluff posts perfect shooting day in Purdue win Purdue center Oscar Cluff took 13 shots in the Boilermakers' 79-59 home win over Marquette – nine from the field and four from the charity stripe – and finished the game with zero misses. Yes: Zero.  His bonkers final stat line: 9 of 9 shooting from the field, 4 of 4 from the free throw line, 11 rebounds, two steals, two blocks. He led all scorers with 22 points. \nIf that feels historic that's because it is. It tied for the most points in Purdue history on 100% shooting efficiency with Caleb Swanigan, who also had 22 points in a 2016 game vs. NJIT. Even more incredible is he did all that damage playing just 23 total minutes – fourth-most on his own team in the win. -- Boone \n\n    \n                                        \n     Winner: Basketball Bedlam goes to the Sooners Conference realignment ended the Oklahoma vs. Oklahoma State football series. Thankfully, the basketball programs are carrying the torch on, though the Sooners are the only ones enjoying it as of late. Oklahoma locked up its fourth straight victory in the rivalry series by racing past the Cowboys for an 85-76 win behind a barrage of 13 made 3-pointers. Xzayvier Brown led the way with 21 points as the Sooners picked up their third win over a high-major opponent. At 7-3, Oklahoma is a long way from last year's 13-0 start. -- Cobb \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Army and Navy are set to clash once again in one of the most anticipated matchups of each college football season, this year in Baltimore as the storied service academies enter the 126th chapter into their legendary rivalry. The Midshipmen lead the all-time series with a 63-55-7 record against the Black Knights as we enter this year's much-anticipated game.  Both teams are headed to bowl games afterwards, with Army facing UConn in the Fenway Bowl and Navy playing Cincinnati in the Liberty Bowl, but before they enter the postseason, they will face off for bragging rights at M&T Bank Stadium. It's the culmination of a strong year for both programs, but players on both sides know success for the season is often defined by the outcome of the Army-Navy Game.  Army comes in at 6-5, shaking off a slow start to win five of their last seven games to get above .500 heading into its finale with Navy. The Black Knights have found some good form defensively in the back half of the season, allowing 24 points or fewer in six of the last seven games, and their offense has found some footing under first-year starter Cale Hellums.  \n        \n            \n                2025 Army vs. Navy Game uniforms: Black Knights, Midshipmen will honor 250 years of service in 126th meeting\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nOn the other side, Navy has a chance to make some program history, as a win would give it back-to-back 10-win seasons for the first time ever. The Midshipmen ran out to a 7-0 start and looked like a threat to reach the American title game, but a loss to North Texas -- and then Notre Dame -- slowed their momentum some. They bounced back to close the year strong with wins over South Florida and Memphis to enter the Army-Navy Game at 9-2, and have done so courtesy of an explosive offense led by quarterback Blake Horvath. \nFollow along with live updates, highlights and analysis as the 126th Army vs. Navy Game takes center stage on Saturday.Where to watch Army vs. Navy 2025 liveDate: Saturday, Dec. 13 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: M&T Bank Stadium -- Baltimore, MDTV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App, Paramount+ Premium Army vs. Navy 2025: Need to know Which offense can crack some explosive plays? Anyone who has ever watched the Army-Navy Game knows that it will be a grueling, physical battle in the trenches. These are two option teams that know exactly what the other wants to do and have more experience maintaining eye discipline and run fits than any other opponent. That tends to create a low-scoring, field position battle. \nIt's so hard to sustain drives for touchdowns in this game because the defenses are so disciplined against the option, which also means any explosive plays hold extra importance. In that department, Navy has been far better this season. The Midshipmen are fourth in the country in 20+ yard runs (30), while Army is all the way back in 84th (12).  Navy's passing attack has been a far bigger weapon this year compared to Army's, as Horvath has thrown for 1,390 yards and nine touchdowns compared to just 504 yards and three touchdowns for Hellums. No one will confuse the Midshipmen with the Air Raid this season, but Horvath's arm does provide them with an additional threat they can spring on defenses that get too aggressive trying to stop the run.  That doesn't mean Army can't dial up something at the right time to create a chunk play, but the Midshipmen provide a more constant threat for explosives both on the ground and through the air -- as we saw in this game a year ago. Limiting that big play potential will be the biggest challenge for this Black Knights defense that has been extremely solid of late, while the offense will need to find a way to scheme up an explosive or two themselves.  \nSpecial teams matter: Field position is always critical in this matchup, and there tend to be a number of punts as the two teams try to pin the others back deep. Execution from start to finish from the punt units will be paramount. The coverage unit that can execute and pin the other team inside their own 10 can set up their team for success, while a punt block or a muffed return can flip the field and swing the outcome.  Points are at a premium in the Army-Navy Game, and that puts added pressure on the field goal units when they do get trotted out -- although, both teams tend to be aggressive going for it on fourth-and-short situations. Army's Dawson Jones is 12 of 17 on field goal attempts this season and a perfect 29 of 29 on extra points. Navy's Nathan Kirkwood has likewise been perfect on XPs, hitting all 46 he's attempted, and hit 9 of 10 field goal attempts.  It'll be cold and a bit breezy on Saturday afternoon in Baltimore, and the special teams units on both sides will need to be on point.  \nBall is the program: Explosive plays don't just have to happen on offense. Ball security is always of the utmost importance in the Army-Navy Game. Horvath and Hellums will have to be sharp with their ball-handling on the option, both on the give and the pitch, as putting the ball on the ground is the cardinal sin in this game.  For as much as they run the ball and how many pitches and pulls are involved in each play, both of these offenses do a great job protecting the football. Army has lost just five fumbles all year, while Navy has given it away six times. That means it shouldn't be an expectation that either team will cough it up, but any opportunity a defense gets, either on a mishandled option give/pitch or by punching the ball out, could be a huge swing.  Army vs. Navy 2025 prediction, pick  \nSo much points to Navy in this game, but when it comes to this rivalry, it's rarely that simple. The old \"throw out the record books\" adage is firmly in play here, and with the form Army's shown in the second half of the season on defense, I expect it to keep this tight all the way through the fourth quarter. We haven't seen Navy in a defensive, grind-it-out type game since the Rice game in late September, and if history tells us anything, that's what we are in store for on Saturday. \nArmy is going to try and limit possessions and make this a rock fight, and I think the Black Knights can largely be successful. That said, even in a game that's played at that preferred pace, Navy's offense just has more firepower and Horvath can create a couple big plays that make the difference in a win for the Midshipmen.

After a slow first day of the Winter Meetings, Kyle Schwarber kicked things off Tuesday by agreeing to a five-year, $150 million contract to return to the Phillies. Edwin Díaz, meanwhile, is joining the World Series-champion Dodgers and slugger Pete Alonso is headed to the Orioles for five years and $155 million.Earlier this winter, right-hander Dylan Cease agreed to a seven-year, $210 million deal with the Blue Jays on Thanksgiving Eve. It's tied for the fourth-largest deal in terms of total money among active pitchers, and is a big boost for the reigning AL champs. While there's no Aaron Judge or Juan Soto on the market this winter, there's plenty of top talent still available. Kyle Tucker, a four-time All-Star who will turn 29 in January, leads the list, and though his second half left much to be desired, he could be a huge asset for any team. Alex Bregman was left on the market until late last winter but he showed no ill effects, putting up a 128 OPS+. On the pitching side, Framber Valdez and Ranger Suárez could frontline almost any rotation.\nJosh Naylor became the first notable hitter to ink a new deal this offseason, heading back to Seattle in the winter's first major free agency deal. He's re-signing with the Mariners on a five-year, $92.5 million deal. The American League pennant-winning Toronto Blue Jays, meanwhile, brought Dylan Cease north of the border on a massive seven-year, $210 million contract, while the Mets signed closer Devin Williams after a disappointing 2025 season with the crosstown Yankees.A record four players -- Brandon Woodruff (Brewers), Shota Imanaga (Cubs), Gleyber Torres (Tigers) and Trent Grisham (Yankees) -- accepted the qualifying offer and are returning to their respective teams for 2026.\n\n        \n            \n                Ranking top 50 MLB free agents for 2026: Kyle Tucker, Alex Bregman at top, plus landing spots for every player\n                \n                    R.J.

One ultra-precise follow-up shot briefly rendered Royval unconscious in Round 1. Royval briefly protested the storage, but quickly relented, and a replay confirmed that he was out cold if only for a moment. \"Now we're talking. Joshua Van, you said Brandon Royval would kick my ass,\" Kape said in his post-fight interview. \"You replaced me. You have my belt. If I didn't break my foot in July, I'd be the champion right now.\"\nKape was twice scheduled to fight Royval earlier this year. Most recently, Kape pulled out of UFC 317 in June. Van replaced Kape and beat Royval in a Fight of the Year frontrunner to earn a title shot, subsequently beating Alexandre Pantoja at UFC 323 to win the flyweight championship.\n\"Now, baby, listen very well, I'm here,\" Kape said. \"Your daddy is going to take your diapers alive on the new Paramount deal. I'm going to take your diapers alive. Get ready. You're in Houston, right? Let's fight in Houston in February. Sign the contract.\"Nobody can deny my belt. I'm the best here.\"Kape's impressive performance further complicates the flyweight title picture. Kape, now tied with Joseph Benavidez for most KOs (five) in UFC flyweight history, will likely usurp Royval's No. 2 ranking. That will put him behind Pantoja, who's currently out with an arm injury, and Tatsuro Taira, who beat two-time champion Brandon Moreno last week.\nUFC matchmakers could realistically insert any of the top three flyweight contenders in a title fight, depending on their availability. \n            ",

For detailed rationale, check out my latest content, including my weekly Lineup Decisions column.               What do the numbers mean?             \nAll of my analyses from the week, from data points to matchup outlooks to game-flow predictions, are basically represented by a number on a confidence scale from 1-10. The higher the number next to a player's name, the more confident I am that you should start him. The numbers are not a projection, just a confidence score to help you pick who to start. Every relevant player for this week is here, so if a player isn't listed, don't start him.                          To find a specific player, use your search function -- CTRL-F on PCs and Command-F on Macs. If neither of those are options, or if you're on a mobile device, you can scroll by game. If you're still unsure, just send a note on X.com (@daverichard), and I'll give it a look, time permitting. Remember to use the #AskFFT hashtag!                          If you're reading this on Sunday, please refer to our weekly rankings, which are updated in real time.                      Ready to get off on the right foot?

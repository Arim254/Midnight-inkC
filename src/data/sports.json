    "body": "\n        The final week of the college football regular season has arrived, and several of Saturday's games will have playoff implications, including a heated SEC rivalry featuring the Alabama Crimson Tide and Auburn Tigers at 7:30 p.m. ET. The Crimson Tide are 8-2 in their last 10 meetings against Auburn, but the Tigers are 5-1 against the spread in their previous six home games against Alabama. According to the latest Week 14 college football odds, the Crimson Tide are favored by 5.5 points on the road, while the over/under for Alabama vs. Auburn is 48.5. SportsLine's advanced computer model is backing Alabama, which is 5-0 in its last five games against Auburn, to cover the spread in 56% of simulations. The model is also backing Miami (-7) to cover the spread on the road against Pitt, while the Over (48.5) hits 63% of the time in North Carolina vs. NC State.

Bet it now at Caesars Sportsbook: Alabama -5.5 vs. AuburnThe Crimson Tide have won five straight against Auburn, and are 11-4 in their last 15 games on the road. Auburn, meanwhile, is just 2-6 in its past eight games and 1-7 in its previous eight matchups against an SEC opponent. Alabama quarterback Ty Simpson, who's thrown for 2,934 yards and 22 touchdowns this season, has yet to throw an interception on the road, and SportsLine's model is expecting he'll lead the Crimson Tide to victory against Auburn. Alabama is projected to cover the spread in 56% of simulations on Saturday. Miami -7 vs. PittThe Miami Hurricanes need a convincing victory on Saturday to bolster their chance of making the College Football Playoff. The Hurricanes are coming off a dominant 34-17 victory on the road at Virginia Tech last week behind a strong showing from quarterback Carson Beck, who threw for 320 yards and four touchdowns. Miami has won 14 of its past 17 meetings against Pitt, a trend SportsLine's model is expecting to continue on Saturday. According to the model's projections, Miami secures a 35-26 victory, helping the Hurricanes cover the spread in 56% of simulations. Over 48.5 points in UNC vs. NC StateThe Tar Heels have disappointed in Bill Belichick's first season at the helm, entering Saturday's in-state rivalry with just four wins. However, the total has gone over in each of the past five meetings between these rivals. The total has also gone over in 13 of NC State's previous 18 games in ACC play. The Wolfpack have scored 48 or more points in two of their last three games at home, and SportsLine's model is projecting these teams will combine for 56 points on Saturday, helping the Over hit in 63% of simulations.Want more Week 14 college football picks?You've seen the model's Week 14 college football best bets for Saturday.

    "body": "\n        Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers missed last week's 31-28 loss to the Chicago Bears due to a fracture in his left wrist, but he will be back in the saddle for Pittsburgh's Week 13 matchup against the Buffalo Bills. Mike Tomlin told reporters on Friday that Rodgers was a full participant in practice, and carries no game designation into Sunday.\"It's all systems go,\" Tomlin said. Tomlin said Tuesday that they were optimistic Rodgers could return this week. The veteran signal-caller did not participate in practice on Wednesday, but returned as a full participant on Thursday and Friday. \"We'll start this week with great optimism although we certainly will limit him at the early portions of the week, provide opportunities for the other quarterbacks while preserving him,\" Tomlin said. \"But again, we're comfortable with the general trajectory, but I'll keep you updated in his level of participation and the quality of his participation over the course of the week will be the greatest indicator.\"\nTomlin told CBS Sports' Evan Washburn shortly before kickoff last Sunday that Rodgers did everything he could to put himself in position to start after suffering the injury during the Week 11 victory against the Cincinnati Bengals, but it was the \"prudent play\" to start Mason Rudolph. \"He fought his tail off all week, but that's the prudent play for us to make as a collective,\" Tomlin said on NFL Today+. \"He won't be playing this week. We'll let Mason start, and obviously, he's absorbed most of the reps this week.\" Rudolph completed 24 of 31 passes for 171 yards, one touchdown and one interception in his first start of the season. The Steelers out-gained the Bears 345 yards to 328, but 186 of Pittsburgh's total yards came on the ground.\nWhen it comes to Rodgers' return to the lineup, the wrist issue is not so much about pain tolerance as it is the ability for the veteran signal-caller to protect himself. The Steelers, now at 6-5, blew a 3.5-game lead in the AFC North to the Baltimore Ravens. However, the Ravens fell back to second place following their Thanksgiving night loss to Joe Burrow and the Bengals. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 Serie A season is in full swing in Italy. Napoli started the campaign as defending champions after winning the 2024-25 title, their fourth Scudetto ever on the last matchday of the season. Inter, Juventus and AC Milan will compete with the team coached by Antonio Conte to win the Serie A title, while other teams such as AS Roma, Atalanta, Lazio, Fiorentina, Bologna and Como are all in contention for a spot in next season's European tournaments.This weekend's Serie A slate features some huge battles, highlighted by AS Roma facing Napoli on Sunday: Here's what to know: Gasperini's strong start of the season AS Roma started off the 2025-26 season really well under the new coach, Gian Piero Gasperini, who joined the Giallorossi in the summer 2025 after a decade spent at Atalanta, where he achieved some incredible results including the 2023-24 UEFA Europa League win in the 3-0 final against Bayer Leverkusen. Despite his strong background, there were some concerns about his impact at the club, considering the issues AS Roma faced in the recent years. However, Gasperini was immediately able to restore the right mentality and won nine of the 12 Serie A games played so far, and lost three. It's difficult to predict if Roma will be among the title contenders until the end of the season, but considering this is only his first season at the club, there are plenty of positives to take ahead of the future. After the 2-1 victory over Midtjylland on Thursday in the UEFA Europa League, Gasperini spoke to Sky Italy ahead of the big game on Sunday, as they currently have a two-point margin on both AC Milan and Napoli. \"We didn't play a great game. We took an early lead and I thought we could have done better technically. It's also true that we play a lot, we moved the ball slowly and made a lot of mistakes. We need to do much better for Sunday against Napoli. Paulo Dybala is back. He's recovered, he has no problems, he could have continued until the last minute.\" Dybala is expected to start against Napoli at the Stadio Olimpico on Sunday. How to watch AS Roma vs. Napoli, oddsDate: Sunday, Nov. 30 | Time: 2:45 p.m. ETLocation: Stadio Olimpico -- Rome Live stream: Paramount+Odds: AS Roma +156; Draw +186; Napoli +208How to watch Serie A Matchday 13All times U.S./Eastern\nFriday, November 28Como 2, Sassuolo 0Saturday, November 29Parma vs. Udinese, 9 a.m. (Paramount+)Genoa vs. Hellas Verona, 9 a.m. (Paramount+)Juventus vs. Cagliari, 12 p.m. (Paramount+)AC Milan vs. Lazio, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)Sunday, November 30Lecce vs. Torino, 6:30 a.m. (Paramount+)Pisa vs. Inter, 9 a.m. (Paramount+)Atalanta vs. Fiorentina, 12 p.m. (Paramount+)AS Roma vs. Napoli, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)\nMonday, December 1Bologna vs. Cremonese, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)\n            ",

I plan to use Shakir in plenty of my DFS lineups for this scoring period.Shakir is $5,500 on DraftKings and $6,300 on FanDuel, and he has the chance for a big game against the Steelers. Pittsburgh is No. 2 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing receivers, and 13 guys have scored at least 15.3 PPR points against the Steelers this season.Shakir has at least seven targets in four of his past five games, and he scored at least 17 PPR points in two of those outings. In Week 12 at Houston, Shakir had eight catches for 110 yards on 10 targets.\nWe'll see if Dalton Kincaid (hamstring) can play this week for the Bills after missing the past two games, and we know Buffalo doesn't trust Keon Coleman, who has been a healthy scratch for the past two weeks. The Bills are so desperate for receiver help that they signed Brandin Cooks, 32, after he was released by New Orleans.Allen has one reliable receiver, and that's Shakir. And he should have the chance for another big game against the Steelers. \nFor more of my DFS plays for Week 13, click on this link to SportsLine.

The Saints have given up the ninth-most rushing yards to opposing backs this season, making Achane a high-value play on Sunday. See who else to pick here.The optimizer's NFL DFS strategy also includes building around Texans receiver Nico Collins at $6,700 on DraftKings and $8,100 on FanDuel. He had a quieter 3-55 receiving line last week on just three targets. That appears to be an anomaly, however, since he was targeted a total of 36 times over the prior three games and put up a 23-303-1 combined receiving line during that span. DFS players can confidently add him on Sunday against a Colts secondary that ranks 23rd in Fantasy points given up to opposing receivers. You can see the rest of the optimizer's NFL DFS picks here.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to build Sunday Week 13 NFL DFS lineupsThe NFL DFS Optimizer is also targeting multiple undervalued players who could explode for huge numbers on Sunday.

    "body": "\n        Luka Dončić led the Lakers to a 135-118 win against the Clippers Tuesday night, finishing with 43 points, 13 assists and nine rebounds. Despite the MVP-caliber night, Dončić made sure to note the safety hazard of the Lakers' neon yellow NBA Cup court, and asked for the league to change the courts altogether.\"Change the courts, please,\" Dončić said after the game. \"It's just slippery. It's dangerous. I slipped. I slipped a lot of times, and you could see a lot of players slipped. And that's dangerous, man.\"Later in the week, Dončić got his wish.The Lakers will not be using the yellow NBA Cup court in their group-stage finale on Friday. When L.A. hosts Anthony Davis and Dončić's former team, the Mavericks, the team will use a regular court. The Lakers' NBA Cup court was deemed \"unplayable\" by league court vendors, per ESPN, and was sent out for repairs.\nThis isn't the firs time Dončić has voiced concern about the NBA Cup courts. During the inaugural NBA Cup tournament in 2023 when he was still a member of the Mavericks, the All-Star guard called out the New Orleans Pelicans' court for being too slippery. Dončić said there were dead spots on the floor because of the court and that the Mavericks shouldn't have played on it because it wasn't stable.There is a difference between the Cup courts and the regular ones that are used for majority of the season. Because of the full-court designs and different colors, the entire court is essentially one big painted decal. On most of the Cup courts, there isn't a speck of wood grain showing through, which gives the players less traction when playing.Dončić noticed how slippery the court was during pregame warmups, and requested for it to be swept again. However, it didn't completely solve the problem.\nTraction problems aside though, Dončić clearly had no problem putting up massive numbers against the Clippers. He shot over 50% from the floor and 3-point range, though perhaps the reason he took 12 3-point attempts was because he didn't want to run the risk of slipping while trying to get to the basket. Either way, it didn't seem to impact his ability to put points on the board.\n            ",

Prior to Liberty, Tuohy was the associate director of football operations and player personnel at Arkansas. \nA graduate of Loyola-Maryland, Tuohy played four seasons of college basketball and one season of football at SMU, where he earned his master's degree. Tuohy was portrayed by actor Jae Head in the 2009 movie \"The Blind Side\" that was based off author Michael Lewis' 2006 book which documented the Tuohy family's relationship with Oher, a future NFL offensive lineman, during his adolescence. In the movie, Tuohy is depicted as an energetic and knowledgeable young sports fan who helped Oher with his college recruiting. Sandra Bullock, who played the role of the family matriarch Leigh Anne Tuohy, won the Best Actress award at the 2010 Oscars.\nOher ultimately played at Ole Miss before being drafted by the Baltimore Ravens in the first round of the 2009 NFL Draft. He played eight seasons in the NFL that included a Super Bowl win as a member of the 2012 Ravens.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        ATLANTA -- In a bar on the Beltline as Texas A&M's hopes of reaching the SEC Championship Game imploded, two Georgia fans debated overlapping December dilemmas: Do we really want to play for the conference title? Would we rather take the first-round bye in the College Football Playoff, or just play through?The argument was fueled partly by libations celebrating an eighth straight win in Clean Old Fashioned Hate -- a grind-it-out 16-9 victory against Georgia Tech. But it speaks to a real tension in late November as teams try to decide where rest ends and rust begins heading into the postseason.Georgia sits at No. 4 for now -- and will certainly move up on Tuesday -- but the looming questions remain. What would have happened to that ranking if Texas A&M had made the SEC title game instead? And what happens if Georgia plays in the game and loses, particularly to Alabama for a second time this season? Kirby Smart, however, sees it differently. There's still something tangible on the line next week, and that's all that matters.\"If you worry about injury risk, we won't practice next week,\" Smart said. \"You live your life scared of injuries, you know what? You get a very scared team. There's also an opportunity to win the SEC championship. Does that matter? Does anybody care about that anymore? I mean, I grew up thinking that was the greatest game in the world, and I just differ from everybody else, yeah, we lost guys today to injury. We're gonna lose guys in practice to injury, but that's next man up. Like, that's wrong with this whole thing now? It's like, well, what if you get hurt? What if you do this? I mean, it's football. It's all part of it.\"\nCollege football's December calendar creates plenty of friction, and depending on who you ask, conference championships are part of the issue. Sorting out who actually qualifies often requires official statements and dizzying tiebreaker scenarios. With leagues continuing to expand and evolve, conference title games seem destined for eventual reimagining. Play-in weekends to an expanded playoff could be the future, though commissioners punted that conversation to January. For now, the banners still matter -- even if a bigger prize waits down the road.When four Georgia players were asked whether they'd prefer to sit out rather than play for a conference title, quarterback Gunner Stockton answered for the group.\"We'll just be ready to play whenever we are.\"Each of the four teams that earned a bye in last year's CFP lost in its -- a small sample size that has fueled fan anxiety about the free pass this season. Georgia and Oregon were slight underdogs, while Boise State and Arizona State faced double-digit spreads. \nThe Dawgs and Ducks fell to teams that sat at home during conference championship weekend (and ultimately met for the national title), while the Broncos and Sun Devils lost for more conventional reasons. Did Georgia and Oregon lose because of the rest, or simply because the opponent was better? The complexion of the top four seeds feels even murkier this year. Last season, they went to the four highest-ranked conference champions; this season, they go to the top four teams overall. Smart declined to engage in that debate.\"Not for me to decide, y'all know me well enough,\" Smart said. \"I'm not in here lobbying those folks that make that decision, or they're sitting in a committee room they make those decisions. Our job is to respond to it.\"Smart said Georgia has mapped out plans for either scenario next week. The staff will juggle signing-day prep, self-scouting work and guidance gathered from programs that dealt with a week off last season. While Georgia will take a structured approach to balancing rest and rust, Smart understands that results -- not planning -- ultimately validate decisions.\n\"The sweet spot is win,\" Smart said. \"People question what the decision was right. There is no right decision. I mean, we talked to coaches all over the place last year that dealt with it. And there was the extended, long way off. There was the not-extended long lay off. There was the Ohio State got hot and they didn't plan a championship game. Look at the end of the day, you got to do what you feel best about and you'll always second-guess it if you lose, and you always won't if you win. So I don't know what that sweet spot is. I know talking to people that I trust and have been through it helps get the information.\"Georgia will play for the SEC Championship next week, like it or not. The Beltline debate is simply a symptom of FBS college football's current crossroads -- a postseason stitched together by overlapping solutions that other levels of the sport perfected long ago, yet still hasn't quite landed here. The fact that this is even a debate among Georgia fans is a blueblood problem, but with the SEC and Big Ten controlling the Playoff's future, the sport's one percent will continue shaping decisions that ripple across everyone else.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        AUSTIN, Texas -- As jubilant Texas fans floated their way out of Darrell K. Royal Texas Memorial Stadium, one burnt-orange clad spectator said to nobody in particular: \"What a win, I don't even remember Athens, Georgia.\" That's the type of memory-erasing magic that comes with a victory in the Lone Star Showdown. The rivalry returned to Austin for the first time in 15 years with the century-old foes reuniting as members of the Southeastern Conference last season.Two years. Two Texas wins. Two heartbreaking SEC championship eliminations for Texas A&M. This game played out with a different cadence than the 2024 version. The No. 3 Longhorns led that 17-7 defensive showdown last season from start to finish. This time Texas trailed 10-3 at halftime to the No. 3 Aggies. \nBut like the 2025 Longhorns have done three other times this season in SEC play, they again got to again utter a variation of: \"They had us in the first half.\" Texas scored 17 straight second-half points to snatch the lead from A&M, closed things out with a pair of fourth-quarter turnovers and handed an 11-0 Texas A&M its first loss of the year. It's a victory that pushes Texas to 9-3 and gives the program an argument to be the first ever three-loss team to reach the playoff.\"These guys are so resilient,\" Sarkisian said. \"This team has been through a lot. When we lost (35-10) in Athens a few weeks ago most teams would have been dead and gone. They answered the bell.\" \nSarkisian rang the bell at halftime telling his team to show some pride, and the Longhorns responded by running with ruthless efficiency.Texas toted the ball 22 times for 157 yards on 7.1 yards per carry in the second half, almost double their average (3.77) on the season. Ahead of the game, Sarkisian showed Wisner a few clips of his 186-yard effort last season against Texas A&M. The Longhorns have struggled to run the ball this season and hadn't had a single game with a 100-yard ball carrier. Sarkisian wanted to create belief in his starting back.  Wisner answered with a season-high 155 yards, including a 48-yard scamper on Texas' opening offensive play of the second half. Sarkisian called inside zone. When Wisner saw the hole and all the green grass ahead of him, he compared it to seeing \"heaven\" open up. \n\"We controlled the game (with the run),\" Sarkisian said. Perhaps nobody responded Friday quite like Longhorn quarterback Arch Manning. A first-year starter labeled the sport's \"first flop\" midway through the year, every Manning throw has been dissected and his every move picked apart. He's played much better since Texas' Red River win over Oklahoma, but he struggled to throw the ball consistently against Texas A&M on a windy Friday evening in Austin -- finishing 14 of 19 for his fourth sub-50% throwing effort of the season. Manning found his accuracy late. He completed six of his final seven passes for 128 yards and a score.When Texas A&M cut Texas' 10-point lead to 20-17 with 9:15 remaining, Manning made the play. Sarkisian dialed up inside zone. Arch found the hole, made a linebacker miss on a shoestring tackle and ran to daylight for the game-clinching score. \n\"It got hard,\" Sarkisian said. \"(Arch) worked his way through it.\" It's a touchdown that led Texas All-American safety Michael Taaffe -- who had a game-sealing interception of his own on senior night -- to declare of Manning: \"The best player in college football, ARCH MANNING.\" People would have laughed at that statement midway through the year. Friday night, maybe with an eye toward 2026 when Manning is expected to return to Austin, it felt possible. After the game Texas A&M's Heisman candidate Marcel Reed, who threw a pair of fourth-quarter interceptions, pulled Manning aside and told him: \"Y'all deserve to be in (the playoff).\"\nThere will be no bigger talking point in Austin, and perhaps college football, over the next nine days than Texas' playoff case. The win over Texas A&M pushed the Longhorns to 9-3. But as every Texas coach and player who spoke postgame were eager to tell you, Texas isn't your usual three-loss team. Sarkisian came to the podium with stats:The Longhorns are the first team since 2019 LSU to beat three top 10 teams (Oklahoma, Vanderbilt, Texas A&M in the regular. \"Chew on that for a second,\" Sarkisian said.\nTexas' strength of schedule sits at 5th nationally per TeamRankings.comTexas played the No. 1 (Ohio State), No. 3 (Texas A&M) and No. 4 Georgia teams in the country Texas went 3-2 against top 10 teams in the regular seasonTexas is the only team to play No. 1 Ohio State to a one-score game this year.That Week 1 game against Ohio State might end up being the crux of Texas' case to the committee. Sarkisian hammered home the idea Texas didn't have to schedule Ohio State. It could have picked another Power Four game, won and finished 10-2. Taaffe went as far to say the Longhorns scheduled a game in Week 1 everyone enjoyed on national TV and the program shouldn't be penalized for it. \"What (message) do we want to send to the head coaches and athletic directors around the country?\" Sarkisian said. \"If we're a 10-2 team right now this isn't a discussion. We're in the playoff.\"I surely think we don't want us to punish us to do that. What are we going to do, we're going to go get out of these games like a lot of teams in the country have done, and they've got nice pretty records right now.\" \nOther teams would surely argue the Longhorns shouldn't have lost to a now 3-8 Florida team or have needed desperate comebacks against SEC bottom feeders Kentucky and Mississippi State. Either way, the committee will be forced to weigh Texas' candidacy because of its Lone Star Showdown statement. It's a victory that somewhat salvages a season that began with Texas ranked as preseason No. 1 for the first time in program history. No player defined that preseason hype (and the up-and-down nature of Texas' season) quite like the Longhorns' QB1. \nManning is just not quite ready to reflect on the season or a reality in which Texas doesn't get to keep playing into December.\"I think we're going to make the playoffs, I don't know why we wouldn't,\" Manning said. \"I'm not going to worry about.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        AUSTIN, Texas -- When No. 3 Texas A&M took the field at Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium against rival No. 16 Texas for the first time in 15 years, they were greeted by chants from the home crowd. \"Overrated! Overrated!\" It may be a slight from Texas fans, but it was an unfamiliar one to the Aggies. The last time Texas A&M was ranked higher than the hated Longhorns in an AP-ranked matchup was 1985. The 2010 Aggies' win came in a year where Texas A&M was ranked and Texas missed a bowl. Simply, anytime Texas and Texas A&M have played meaningful football in the 21st Century, the Aggies have come in as underdogs. On Friday, the Aggies were the center of attention. They could cement their first SEC Championship Game appearance and first-round bye in the College Football Playoff. And perhaps more delicious, they could plant a dagger in the heart of the Texas playoff case. Instead, in a stunning 27-17 loss, the battered Aggies of old re-emerged. \n        \n            \n                2025 SEC Championship Game scenarios: Georgia clinches spot, Alabama and Ole Miss remain in contention\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"We're going to drive to College Station for the next two hours and it's probably going to be really silent,\" linebacker Taurean York said. \"It hurts a lot.\" \nTexas A&M was resilient during its perfect 11-0 start, the first since 1992 in College Station. The program was defined by finding a way, whether it be through big plays from quarterback Marcel Reed or their star-studded defense. But against Texas, that confidence proved to be their undoing. The Aggies jumped out to a 10-3 lead at the half, and received the ball to start the third quarter. Texas A&M was 15-0 when leading at halftime under Mike Elko. A touchdown could have opened the floodgates. Instead, Texas A&M gave up one of its worst quarters of the season, a 17-0 run to Texas dominated by missed opportunities. There was a botched fourth-and-1 call that was called for a false start, forcing a punt. The secondary bit hard on an Arch Manning rushing attempt, leaving Ryan Wingo wide open in the end zone for a toe-touching catch. Texas running back Quintrevion Wisner took over for the second year in a row. \nTexas A&M fought back in the fourth quarter, but the damage was done. Quarterback Marcel Reed threw two bad interceptions -- including one in the red zone to safety Michael Taaffe. The collapse was on. \"We wanted to go to the SEC championship,\" York said. \"We're tired of losing to the same team in back-to-back years, tired of not winning that trophy.\" Across the season, Texas A&M lived on a razor's edge. They needed a magical fourth-down conversion to shock No. 8 Notre Dame 41-40 under the watchful eye of Touchdown Jesus. They outlasted Arkansas 45-42 and came from 27 points down in a 31-30 victory against South Carolina. \nIn big moments, Texas A&M has stood tall, but the on-field resume had some holes. The Aggies were 7-0 in SEC play, but the wins came against teams with a combined record of 11-41 in conference play. No. 16 Texas is the first team that Texas A&M played that was ranked in the committee's top 25 since Notre Dame in Week 2. Because of the mediocre resume, Texas A&M was the lowest-ranked of the remaining undefeateds at No. 3. Losing pushes them into the range of other one-loss teams. Certainly, No. 4 Georgia will jump them after outlasting No. 23 Georgia Tech. No. 5 Texas Tech will also have a chance if they win the Big 12 next week. With the disappointing loss against an up-and-down Texas team, will No. 6 Oregon factor in? Or No. 7 Ole Miss? And equally as disappointing, Texas A&M's conference title drought dates back to 1998. \nA rivalry game win is off the table, along with an SEC championship, but Texas A&M still has plenty to play for. The Aggies are a lock for the College Football Playoff with an 11-1 record in the SEC. A lone bright spot, the postseason could now head to Kyle Field if the Aggies fall out of the top four. \"There's a lot in front of us,\" Reed said. \"We've got a lot to work for, so we can't hold our heads down. We've got to get prepared for what's next.\" On a gloomy day in Austin, Texas A&M had a chance to silence critics and put the notorious Battered Aggie Syndrome behind them. Instead, once again, they came up short. \n            ",

Several conferences enter the weekend with crowded races at the top, and every kickoff has the potential to reshape who plays for titles as November winds down.The action begins Friday with a pair of midday showdowns. Kent State looks to finish a resurgent season on a high note, while Northern Illinois aims to preserve a home dominance in the series. Later, San Diego State travels to New Mexico in one of the weekend's most consequential games: a win sends San Diego State to the Mountain West Championship Game, while New Mexico needs both a victory and outside help to host the league finale for the first time in program history.You can bet college football games this week at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager.

Later in the afternoon, Kennesaw State has a chance to reach the Conference USA Championship Game in just its second FBS season, heading to Liberty for a matchup that carries revenge potential after last year's meeting flipped the league narrative.\nThe nightcap features a rivalry with Mountain West stakes attached, as UNLV seeks both a win and multiple results across the conference to earn another shot at the league crown. Nevada, meanwhile, enters on its best stretch of the season and looks to spoil those hopes in Reno.CBS Sports Network will carry all five games, with full viewing info, betting lines and key storylines to follow as Week 14 unfolds.All times Eastern | Odds via SportsLine consensusBall State vs. Miami (Ohio)Date: Saturday, Nov. 29 | Time: 12 p.m.Location: Fred C.

    "body": "\n        In their 31-24 loss to the Green Bay Packers on Thanksgiving, the Detroit Lions lost star receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown to an ankle injury on just the fourth offensive play of the game. St. Brown was ruled out after halftime, and according to coach Dan Campbell, he will miss some time.Campbell said in his postgame press conference that, while St. Brown may have avoided a lengthy absence, team doctors expect the standout pass catcher to be sidelined for multiple weeks.\"I'll know more tomorrow,\" Campbell said. \"I don't feel like this is long-long-term. That's the good news, but it could be a week or two, maybe, if we're lucky.\"According to NFL Media, MRI and further testing confirmed that St. Brown suffered a low-ankle sprain with no structural damage. The injury could have him out of action 1-2 weeks, but the WR is pushing to play through it.\nOn the game's second drive, St. Brown was rolled up from behind while blocking on a run play. He remained on the turf for a few minutes while he was evaluated by trainers. Eventually, St. Brown got up and walked off the field, straight to the locker room. He was initially listed as questionable to return, only to be officially ruled out in the third quarter.In 11 games this season, St. Brown has caught 75 passes for 884 yards and nine touchdowns. The Lions on Sunday were already playing without tight end Sam LaPorta, who was placed on injured reserve earlier this month with a back injury, and wide receiver Kalif Raymond, who was inactive with an ankle injury.Dan Campbell will call upon Jameson Williams, Tom Kennedy, plus rookies Isaac TeSlaa and Dominic Lovett, to potentially step up in St. Brown's absence.\nWith St. Brown out of the lineup, the Lions have some work to do if they're going to climb the NFC North standings down the stretch. Now 7-5, Detroit sits third in the NFC North, looking up at the Green Bay Packers and Chicago Bears. Over the next two weeks, the Lions get crucial NFC clashes against the Dallas Cowboys and Los Angeles Rams. Those games will be major tests, especially if St. Brown is sidelined.\n            ",

J.J. McCarthy will miss his sixth start of the season after he suffered a concussion last week in the 23-6 loss to the Green Bay Packers. McCarthy was injured during Minnesota's loss to Green Bay. He was on the field for the Vikings' final drive late in the fourth quarter and threw an interception to Packers defensive back Evan Williams that allowed Green Bay to run the clock out. It marked McCarthy's second interception of the game and 10th of the season. The 2024 first-round pick also threw for a season-low 87 yards and posted a passer rating of 34.2, the worst of his career. McCarthy has thrown more interceptions than touchdowns in four of his six starts this season. He entered the 2025 season as Minnesota's starter after the Vikings let Sam Darnold walk in free agency. \n        \n            \n                NFL Week 13 odds, predictions, expert picks: Can Bills bounce back vs. Steelers?

McCarthy returned on Nov. 2 and led the Vikings to a win against the Detroit Lions. The Vikings are 0-3 in their last three games with McCarthy leading the offense. McCarthy, who joined Minnesota as the 10th overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, also missed all of his rookie season after tearing his meniscus in his first preseason game with the Vikings. \nWho is Max Brosmer?Brosmer, 24, found his way to the Vikings this offseason after going undrafted out of the University of Minnesota. In his lone season at Minnesota, Brosmer threw for 2,617 yards, 17 touchdowns and five interceptions while completing 66.8% of his attempts. Brosmer arrived at Minnesota after emerging as an FCS All-American at New Hampshire, where he started 34 games across four seasons. In his final season at New Hampshire, Brosmer threw for 3,464 yards and 29 touchdowns before using his final year of eligibility to transfer up to the FBS level. Despite a strong season at Minnesota, Brosmer went undrafted but caught on with the Vikings and made the team as the third-string quarterback behind McCarthy and Carson Wentz (who is also injured). In the preseason, Brosmer completed 60.3% of his passes for 364 yards, two touchdowns and one interception. Brosmer has actually seen time in three games this season, completing 5 of 8 passes for 42 yards.\nAnd with McCarthy and Wentz now sidelined, Brosmer will make his first career NFL start on Sunday in Seattle. \n            ",

The team announced on Thursday that Dart had officially cleared the concussion protocol, and now, he's officially ready to take the field again.  Dart has missed the last two games with a concussion he suffered against the Chicago Bears in Week 10, which was Brian Daboll's final contest as the Giants coach. Kafka made the decision to start Jameis Winston in Dart's place. And while the former No. 1 overall pick did bring a spark to New York's offense (especially in last week's overtime loss to the Detroit Lions), he couldn't bring any wins. The 2-10 Giants have lost six straight games, and became the first team to be officially eliminated from playoff contention last week. \n        \n            \n                NFL Week 13 odds, predictions, expert picks: Can Bills bounce back vs. Steelers?

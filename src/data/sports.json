    "body": "\n        The 2026 PGA Tour schedule gets underway at the 2026 Sony Open in Hawaii on Thursday, Jan. 15. The season opener at Waialae Country Club in Honolulu comes a week later than normal after The Sentry was cancelled this year due to course concerns. That means there will be just one event on the Hawaii Swing this year, and some top players decided not to make the trip. Big names like Collin Morikawa, Hideki Matsuyama, J.J. Spaun and Jordan Spieth, however, are among the golfers in the Sony Open field as the first tee times in Round 1 come at 12:10 p.m. ET.The latest 2026 Sony Open odds from DraftKings Sportsbook list Russell Henley as the +1100 favorite. Matsuyama and Ben Griffin are at +1700, followed by Spaun at +1800. Morikawa joins Si Woo Kim and Robert MacIntyre at +2000. Spieth is +4500, just a bit behind defending champion Nick Taylor, who joins Adam Scott as one of five golfers at +4000. Before locking in any 2026 Sony Open picks or making any PGA DFS picks on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up over $8,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.This same model has also nailed a whopping 16 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- as well as this year's PGA Championship and Open Championship. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting sites. \nNew users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Now that the 2026 Sony Open field is locked in, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard. 2026 Sony Open predictions One major surprise the model is calling for at the 2026 Sony Open: Henley, the betting favorite who begins at 12:54 p.m. ET in Round 1 on Thursday, stumbles and barely finishes inside the top 5. He's a golfer to avoid this week. The 2013 Sony Open champion hasn't been able to follow up on that success at this event with regularity. Since that time, he's missed the cut twice and has three other finishes outside the top 30. Last year, he finished T10. He's played just once since last year's playoffs and finished 19th at the Procore Championship, so the model doesn't love his value as a favorite this year. See who else to fade here. \nAnother surprise: Ben Griffin, who is +1700, makes a strong run at the title. He's a target for anyone looking for a huge payday. \"One of the best values on the board,\" McClure told SportsLine. \"My number is meaningfully shorter than the market, which is exactly what you want when laying a shorter outright.\" See who else to pick here. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:How to make 2026 Sony Open picksThe model's best bets also include five longshots of +3500 or higher in outright bets, including an enormous +40000 underdog. You can only see the model's picks here. \nWho will win the 2026 Sony Open, and which longshots will stun the golfing world?

    "body": "\n        Russell Henley enters the new season as the odds-on favorite to win the 2026 Sony Open in Hawaii. The American enters as the fifth-ranked golfer in the men's top 200. The former University of Georgia standout will be seeking his sixth PGA Tour win and ninth as a professional. His last win came at last year's Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay   Hill, Fla., in March. This year's event gets underway on Thursday at 1:49 p.m. ET from Waialae Country Club in Honolulu,  Hawaii. The tournament will be played on a par-70 course measuring 7,044 yards. Henley is the +1100 favorite (risk $100 to win $1,100) in the 2026 Sony Open odds at DraftKings Sportsbook. Other favorites include Hideki Matsuyama and Ben Griffin at +1700, J.J. Spaun at +1800, and Si Woo Kim, Robert MacIntyre and Collin Morikawa at +2000. Before making any 2026 Sony Open picks, you need to see the 2026 Sony Open predictions and best bets from golf expert Brady Kannon. Kannon is an elite golfing handicapper with more than 30 years of experience in the industry. He's hit eight major outright winners since 2013. In the fall of 2022, he hit outright winners in three consecutive weeks: Russell Henley (40-1), Tony Finau (18-1) and Adam Svensson (150-1). Last season, he hit Hideki Matsuyama (22-1), Harris English (110-1), Ludvig Aberg (25-1) and Ben Griffin/Andrew Novak (25-1) in New Orleans. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Now, Kannon has focused his attention on the 2026 Sony Open field and locked in his best bets and top sleepers. You can only see them here. Top 2026 Sony Open expert picks One of Kannon's 2026 Sony Open predictions: He's fading Tom Hoge, the 36-year-old TCU grad. He's +20000 in the outright market, and Kannon is staying away from him there and in bets like making the cut and head-to-head. \"The TCU Horned Frog has dipped to 99th in the OWGR and in five starts over the FedExCup Fall, Hoge missed the cut three times,\" Kannon said. \"In fact, dating back to the PGA Championship last May, Hoge has missed nine cuts over 15 starts on Tour. Hoge has played the Sony Open 10 times and despite a third-place finish in 2018, he has missed the cut four times. I am not banking on him returning to form just yet.\" See who Kannon is backing at SportsLine.Another golfer that Kannon is fading is Tony Finau, who is +11000. The 36-year-old turned pro in 2007 and has earned six wins on the PGA Tour, one on the Korn Ferry Tour as well as two others. He registered his last win at the Mexico Open in April 2023.\"It has been a tumultuous past year or so for Finau, battling legal issues and a golf game that saw him finish top-10 just one time in 2025,\" Kannon said. \"Approach play, Scrambling, Greens in Regulation, Putting – you name it, Finau has dropped to 125th to 150th territory in the Tour rankings across the board statistically. I imagine it will turn around for a player of his caliber, but I am not going to count on it happening just yet. In five prior visits to Waialae, Finau has missed the cut twice and never finished better than 20th. Both \"Hoge and Finau are priced in the triple digits to win this week but if you can find a head-to-head matchup in which to go against them, it is worth a hard look.\" See who else to back here.New users can also check out the latest bet365 bonus code to get $200 in bonus bets after placing a $5 bet:How to make 2026 Sony Open picksKannon has revealed his best bet, and it's a surprising golfer who has extremely strong metrics in Strokes Gained: Approach and Scrambling.

    "body": "\n        The latest DraftKings promo code gives new users $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins. The Cleveland Cavaliers didn't expect to surpass their loss total from less season more than a month before the 2026 NBA All-Star Game, but coming off a 64-18 season is a tough standard to maintain. The Cavaliers haven't been nearly as dominant over their 22-19 start to the 2025-26 NBA season, but the SportsLine projection model expects them to pick up a quality Eastern Conference win over the Philadelphia 76ers as a part of its Wednesday best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook.The model has also locked in a college basketball best bet, backing No. 14 North Carolina to cover as 3.5-point favorites against Stanford in California. One of SportsLine's top experts has also locked in a college basketball pick on Iona vs. Rider at 7 p.m. ET. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every NBA game 10,000 times and has returned well over $10,000 in betting profit for $100 players on its top-rated NBA picks over the past eight-plus seasons. The model enters Week 13 of the 2025-26 NBA season on a sizzling 34-15 roll on top-rated NBA spread picks dating back to last season.

The Cavaliers are coming off a 123-112 upset loss to the Jazz on Monday, but they were 5-2 over their prior seven games before that result. Cleveland travels to Philadelphia, but the Cavaliers have won two of their last three road games, including knocking off the Spurs. The Cleveland lineup features the majority of the same pieces from last year's 64-18 season, leading the model to consider the Cavaliers a better team than their current 22-19 record indicates. The 76ers have lost two of their last three home games, and the model projects the Cavaliers to win in 60% of simulations, showcasing strong value at their current odds. Back the Cavaliers at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:North Carolina (-3.5) vs. Stanford (-110)The Tar Heels had the No. 5 freshman class this season, according to rankings by 247Sports, highlighted by 6-foot-10 freshman forward Caleb Wilson. Wilson was the No. 8-ranked Class of 2025 player by 247Sports, and he's justified that position with four 20-point double-doubles over his last five games. He's averaging 19.5 points and 11 rebounds per game this season. The Tar Heels also have experience, though, with senior center Henri Veesaar (16.9 points, 9.2 rebounds) and senior guard Seth Trimble (15.7 ppg). North Carolina (14-2, 2-1 ACC) is No. 14 in the nation and 8-1 over its last nine games, including a road victory over Kentucky. Stanford (13-4, 2-2) is coming off a 70-55 loss to No. 23 Virginia on Saturday. The model projects North Carolina to cover in 57% of simulations. Back North Carolina at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Iona (-7.5) vs. Rider (-110)\"Things aren't going too well for Rider, which might have a case as the worst-shooting team in America,\" legendary SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall said. \"To wit: only four teams out of 361 shoot less accurately from the floor than the Broncs' 38.6%, and there isn't one team that shoots triples worse than Rider, whose at 24.7% from beyond the arc are bottom-of-the-barrel nationally, with second-worst East Carolina not even that close. The plight is reflected by All-Name soph guard Flash Burton, who followed up his recent 27-point game vs. Fairfield by getting blanked on Sunday by Marist. Meanwhile, Iona has steadied since scoring just 38 in a recent lopsided loss vs. that same Marist, blowing out Niagara and Canisius last week while allowing just 50 ppg in the process.\" Back Iona at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:\nWant more NBA, college basketball picks for Wednesday?You've seen some of the model's Wednesday best bets.

Have been blessed with so many great relationships and mentors over the years that I am forever grateful for! Thank you to everyone who has supported me through the years it has meant everything to my family and I! ❤️\" Thielen, 35, posted.Thielen's rise is one of the more remarkable ones in recent memory. Undrafted out of Minnesota State University, Mankato in 2013, Thielen earned a contract after impressing at rookie tryouts. He ended up being one of the Vikings' final roster cuts ahead of the season, but he remained with the team on the practice squad.Thielen played mostly special teams in 2014 and 2015 before breaking out for a 69-catch, 967-yard campaign in 2016. He topped 1,250 yards in both 2017 and 2018, earning Pro Bowl nods both seasons. His 113 catches in 2018 are fourth-most in a single season, bettered by only Justin Jefferson and Cris Carter.\nThielen ranks in the top five in Vikings history in receptions (542 -- fourth), receiving yards (6,751 -- fifth) and receiving touchdowns (55 -- third).In 2023, Thielen signed with the Carolina Panthers and promptly produced a renaissance season: His 103 receptions and 1,014 yards were both his most since 2018.With the Vikings' wide receiver corps reeling with injuries and Jordan Addison's suspension entering the 2025 season, Minnesota reunited with Thielen. A few months later, after his release request was granted, he spent the final few weeks of the season (and one playoff game) with the Pittsburgh Steelers.\nThielen finishes his career as one of the most productive undrafted players ever.Adam Thielen career statisticsRank among undrafted playersReceptions7044thReceiving yards8,4974thReceiving touchdowns644th\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The Boston Red Sox have landed one of the best starting pitchers on the free-agent market, as they've agreed to terms with left-hander Ranger Suárez on a five-year pact worth $130 million, CBS Sports HQ's Jim Bowden has confirmed. The deal has no deferrals, opt outs, or no-trade clause. The Red Sox haven't yet announced the signing. This marks the first major-league free-agent signing of the winter for Boston.The 30-year-old Suárez is coming off a 2025 season for the Phillies in which he pitched to a 3.20 ERA with 151 strikeouts and 38 unintentional walks in 157 ⅓ innings. That was good for a WAR of 4.7. For his career, Suárez has an ERA+ of 125 and a WAR of 17.8 across parts of eight big-league seasons. He earned his first and to date only All-Star selection in 2024. Earlier in the offseason, CBS Sports ranked Suárez as the No. 10 free agent in the class of 2025-26. Here's part of that write-up: According to Baseball Reference's calculations, Suárez's most similar pitcher through this stage of his career is Framber Valdez. Teams are likely to work through that juxtaposition whenever they consider the top of the pitching market. Suárez is more than a year younger than Valdez, and he operates with a broader arsenal, but Valdez has better stuff and a more robust track record of being an innings sponge. Even if Suárez is viewed by the market as a lesser Valdez, he should land a multi-year contract to serve in the middle of some club's rotation.CBS Sports had also predicted that Suárez would sign a five-year pact worth $125 million -- or, almost exactly the deal he landed. \nIn Boston, Suárez will join a crowded rotation that notably already includes lefty Garrett Crochet and two offseason trade additions: right-handers Sonny Gray and Johan Oviedo, as well as veterans Brayan Bello and Patrick Sandoval, and youngsters Payton Tolle, Connelly Early, and Kyle Harrison. It's to be seen if the Red Sox ship a few of those pitchers out to fill other needs before Opening Day.Indeed, the Red Sox recently came up short in their attempt to retain infielder Alex Bregman and have since been connected to fellow infielder Bo Bichette. It's unclear if the Suárez signing will impact the Red Sox's pursuit of Bichette. \nThe Red Sox are coming off a 2025 season that saw them win 89 games before being eliminated by the New York Yankees in the wild-card round.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Mikel Arteta faces a crisis of numbers for Wednesday's EFL Cup semifinal first leg at Chelsea with William Saliba at risk of joining three other defenders on the sidelines at Stamford Bridge. Saliba missed Arsenal's FA Cup third round trip to Portsmouth with what Arteta has now confirmed was a knock and, along with Leandro Trossard, was rated by his manager as a \"doubt\" to make the trip to west London.Arteta has been known to sew the seeds of confusion over the status of players before key games in the past and it remains to be seen whether he might indeed be ready to return to the side. That the Arsenal manager said that the injuries to both Trossard and Saliba were \"nothing serious\" does at least offer hope that they might be available.Arsenal could do with the latter given that Arteta confirmed that both Piero Hincapie and Riccardo Calafiori will not have recovered in time for the cup tie. Hincapie limped out of last week's 0-0 draw with Liverpool and despite undergoing scans since then Arteta insisted he is in the dark as to a return date for the Ecuadorian.Viewing information: Chelsea vs. ArsenalDate: Wednesday, Jan. 14 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Stamford Bridge -- LondonLive stream: Paramount+Odds: Chelsea +200; Draw +220; Arsenal +120Calafiori has been out since December 27 when he pulled up in the warm-up before a game against Brighton. He is \"a few weeks\" away from making his return from an injury that he had suffered the day before and which Arsenal initially considered asking him to play through. It speaks volumes on Arteta's caution around injury updates that what exactly Calafiori has injured is still unclear, the manager saying it was \"a muscle\" when asked directly.\nThe final unavailable defender for the trip to Chelsea is Cristhian Mosquera though there was a more concrete update on that front. The center back has been sidelined since an awkward landing in a win over Brentford on December 3 but his recovery is progressing well, his progress back to the first team at a similar stage to young forward Max Dowman.\"Very similar injury, very similar timeframes,\" said Arteta. \"Both of them did really well, but they're not training yet, so they're still a few weeks away.\"Despite the injuries Arteta could still have the quality to field a strong back four even if Saliba is out. In those circumstances one of Jurrien Timber or Ben White could partner Gabriel with the other at right back and Myles Lewis-Skelly on the left. Christian Norgaard could also slot into the center back role where he has started twice already this season.\nWhatever the lineup Arteta is intent on taking the EFL Cup seriously. Without a trophy since lifting the FA Cup in 2020, the Arsenal manager is intent on putting everything he has into winning the trophy. There will be no repeat of his old boss Arsene Wenger's policy of handing this competition over to the kids.\"In my case we cannot do that because obviously players have to be available to be able to pick them there,\" he said. \"I don't believe in players for competitions. I believe that we have competition and we want to compete in our competition with the best moment of the players that we have in our resource and that's what we try to do.\"Chelsea meanwhile will be without the suspended Moises Caicedo. Reece James, Malo Gusto and Cole Palmer are also doubts after missing the win at Charlton in the FA Cup, Liam Rosenior confirmed on Monday.\nPredicted lineupsChelsea XI: Robert Sanchez; Josh Acheampong, Wesley Fofana, Trevoh Chalobah, Marc Cucurella; Reece James, Andrey Santos; Estevao, Enzo Fernandez, Pedro Neto; Joao PedroArsenal XI: Kepa Arrizabalaga; Jurrien Timber, William Saliba, Gabriel Magalhaes, Myles Lewis-Skelly; Martin Odegaard, Martin Zubimendi, Declan Rice; Bukayo Saka, Viktor Gyokeres, Gabriel Martinelli\n            ",

    "body": "\n        When longtime Pittsburgh Steelers coach Mike Tomlin stepped down from his role on Tuesday after a 19-year run with the franchise, he sparked a shakeup among the longest-tenured coaches in major American professional sports. No active coach in the NFL, NBA, NHL, MLB, MLS or the WNBA had spent more time with one team than Tomlin. Following his departure, Miami Heat coach Erik Spoelstra holds the title of the country's longest-tenured coach, and he has a five-season lead on the next-most-experienced coach -- Jon Cooper of the Tampa Bay Lightning.Spoelstra, now in Year 18 with the Heat, did not relish in that reality, though. Instead, he said Tomlin's exit \"really bummed me out\" and that he wishes he was not the holder of his new rare title.\"Some people could look at that as a badge of honor,\" Spoelstra said in a pregame media availability session. \"I look at that as really a disappointment to this profession, that there's not more coaches that are given an opportunity to work through things. For sure, my greatest opportunities of growth have been from disappointing seasons, where we really went to work during the offseason to find ways to get better.\"Longest-tenured coaches in major U.S. sportsCoachTeamLeagueSeasonsErik SpoelstraMiami HeatNBA18Cheryl ReeveMinnesota LynxWNBA16Jon CooperTampa Bay LightningNHL13Andy ReidKansas City ChiefsNFL13Steve KerrGolden State WarriorsNBA12Kevin CashTampa Bay RaysMLB11Dave RobertsLos Angeles DodgersMLB10Jared BednarColorado AvalancheNHL10Torey LovulloArizona DiamondbacksMLB9Brian SchmetzerSeattle SoundersMLS9Sean McDermottBuffalo BillsNFL9Sean McVayLos Angeles RamsNFL9Kyle ShanahanSan Francisco 49ersNFL9Coaches do not build lengthy careers without sustained success and championship pedigree, and each of the most experienced leaders in sports possess those traits. Spoelstra is a two-time NBA champion and widely regarded as one of the league's greatest coaches of all time. Tomlin racked up more than 200 career victories and never logged a losing season.\nThe Steelers fanbase's faith in Tomlin wavered in the final stanza of his tenure, though, and things became untenable this season despite Pittsburgh winning the AFC North.\"My video room has sent me interview clips of coach Tomlin for years,\" Spoelstra said. \"I just love everything he's about. He's a coach's coach, super motivational in how he articulates his thoughts.\"\nSpoelstra's leash, meanwhile, remains long despite the Heat having gone more than a decade since winning their last championship. Miami last reached the NBA Finals in 2023 and has been a playoff team every year under Spoelstra's watch. His squads have also consistently exceeded expectations. That 2022-23 team, for instance, reached the finals despite entering the playoffs as the Eastern Conference's No. 7 seed.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Alabama quarterback Ty Simpson signed paperwork this week to officially enter the 2026 NFL Draft, CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz confirms, ending speculation he could be a potential transfer option at various programs in need, including Miami. In a draft light on quarterback prospects, CBS Sports' Mike Renner has Simpson landing with the Los Angeles Rams at No. 29 in his latest mock draft.Even after he publicly stated his intentions last week to go pro, Simpson told On3 that Miami, Tennessee and Ole Miss all continued to pursue him. Miami's offer reached $6.5 million, Simpson said. \"Miami was kind of like, 'All right, we're moving on,' and then they lost out on Sam Leavitt and came back with that big number,\" Simpson told On3. \"And then Ole Miss called again and said they could match it.\"\n        \n            \n                Renner's 2026 NFL mock draft 6.0: Steelers beef up the offensive line with Aaron Rodgers' future in doubt\n                \n                    Mike Renner                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSimpson said legacy was important to him, particularly being a team captain at Alabama.\n\"Everybody would just remember me as the guy who took all this money and went to Miami or Tennessee for his last year, but I was a captain,\" Simpson said. \"I put my hand and footprints in the cement at Denny Chimes. I would have lost everything that I built at Alabama.\"In his first year as a starter, Simpson, 23, threw for 3,567 yards, 30 touchdowns and five interceptions, helping the Crimson Tide make the College Football Playoff and win a first-round game against Oklahoma. Alabama lost 38-3 in the quarterfinals against Indiana. He ranks 30th overall in CBS Sports' 2026 NFL Draft Prospect Rankings and is the No. 3 quarterback, behind Indiana's Fernando Mendoza and Oregon's Dante Moore.\nSimpson, a redshirt junior this fall, got off to a strong start to the season and had thrown 21 touchdowns and just one interception through the Crimson Tide's first nine games. However, he struggled in Alabama's regular-season loss to Oklahoma in mid-November and threw two interceptions in a blowout win over FCS opponent Eastern Illinois the next week. He also completed fewer than half of his passes in an SEC Championship Game loss to Georgia. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Signs point toward emerging Jacksonville Jaguars star Travis Hunter returning to the lineup in time for the start of the 2026 season, as general manager James Gladstone said Wednesday that the No. 2 pick's recovery from a knee injury is \"going as expected.\" Hunter underwent surgery in November to repair his LCL, and the initial timeline for his return to football activities was six months. The two-way standout could be ready for OTAs in May if he remains on schedule.Hunter sustained the non-contact injury in practice and landed on injured reserve on Oct. 31. While there was no initial indication that Hunter would miss the rest of the season, his surgery two weeks later marked the end of what was quickly becoming a strong rookie campaign.\"Very fair to say that his rehab process is going as expected,\" Gladstone said. \"He's hitting it hard. Obviously the joy that he brings to the everyday operation is still something that permeates throughout the space that he enters.\"When Hunter returns to full strength, the expectation is that he will reprise his role as a contributor at both wide receiver and cornerback. He played over 100 snaps at both spots as a rookie with slightly more time spent on offense.\n        \n            \n                Prisco's NFL divisional picks: Bills, Josh Allen too much for Broncos D, Rams end Bears' Cinderella season\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThat positional flexibility could evolve throughout Hunter's career. Gladstone hinted at an expanded role on defense in 2026 given the state of the Jaguars' roster on the heels of an AFC South title and first-round playoff exit. \n\"We still expect him to play on both sides of the ball,\" Gladstone said. \"Obviously you can take a peek at expiring contracts on our roster and which side of the ball has more. Obviously at this point walking into the offseason, corner is a position that we have a few guys who are on expiring contracts. So by default, you can expect there to be a higher emphasis on his placement.\"The Jaguars made an effort to involve Hunter in the offense to a greater extent in the weeks leading up to his injury, and it resulted in an uptick in production. His final game of the year was his most stellar outing to date, as he racked up a season-high 14 targets and turned them into eight receptions for 101 yards and his first touchdown.For the season, Hunter posted 28 catches, 298 yards and a touchdown on offense with 15 tackles and three passes defended on defense.\n\"The steps that he was taking by the midpoint of the season really made us feel good about what the back half of the year was going to be on both sides of the ball and what that impact was going to look like, being a featured point on offense and an impact player on defense,\" Gladstone said. \"It was just disappointing timing, but nonetheless feel good about where we are heading into this offseason and what next year should hold.\"\n            ",

There was no drama in the final game of the wild-card round, however, with the Texans routing the Steelers, 30–6, on Monday night to earn the first road playoff win in franchise history. Houston became the eighth and final team to punch its ticket to the divisional round.In the AFC, the Texans will be joined by New England, Buffalo and Denver. The top-seeded Broncos, coming off a bye, will be in action for the first time this postseason when they host the Bills on Saturday. Houston, meanwhile, will head to New England on Sunday with a spot in the AFC Championship Game on the line.In the NFC, Seattle and San Francisco will meet for the third time this season after splitting their first two matchups. The Seahawks are well-rested after a wild-card bye, while the 49ers will be playing on just five days' rest. In the other divisional matchup, the Bears will host the Rams, marking Chicago's first home divisional-round game in 15 years.With that in mind, here's the full playoff schedule, including the dates and kickoff times for the divisional round.Wild Card WeekendSaturday, Jan. 10(5) Rams 34-31 over (4) PanthersRams vs. Panthers recap: The Panthers almost pulled off the upset, but they couldn't stop Matthew Stafford with the game on the line. With the Rams trailing 31-27, Stafford engineered a 71-yard game-winning scoring drive that ended when he hit Colby Parkinson with a 19-yard touchdown with just 38 seconds left to play. Stafford threw for 304 yards and three touchdowns in the win. (2) Bears 31-27 over (7) PackersPackers vs. Bears recap: The Bears pulled off the third-largest fourth-quarter comeback in NFL history. Going into the final quarter, the Bears were trailing by 15 points, but they were able to erase that deficit during a miracle quarter where they outscored the Packers, 25-6. Caleb Williams threw for more yardage (184) in the fourth quarter than he did in the first three quarters combined (177). Williams capped things off with a 25-yard score to DJ Moore with just 1:43 left to win the game. Sunday, Jan. 11(6) Bills 27-24 over (3) Jaguars\nBills vs. Jaguars recap: For the first time in his career, Josh Allen led a game-winning drive in the fourth quarter of a playoff game. The Bills' franchise quarterback scored the game-winning touchdown on a 1-yard run with just one minute left to play. Allen also threw a 15-yard TD pass in the fourth quarter to help propel Buffalo to the win. Allen totaled 306 yards and three touchdowns in the win. For the Bills, it was their first road playoff win in 33 years. (6) 49ers 23-19 over (3) Eagles49ers vs. Eagles recap: The 49ers pulled off a shocker by going on the road and knocking off the Eagles. After losing George Kittle, the 49ers had some unlikely heroes, including Demarcus Robinson, who caught six passes for 111 yards and a touchdown. Christian McCaffrey also came up big with two touchdowns, including the game-winning score, which came on a 4-yard pass from Brock Purdy with just 2:54 left to play. (2) Patriots 16-3 over (7) ChargersChargers vs. Patriots recap: The Patriots defense took over and carried New England to the win. Justin Herbert was sacked six times as the Patriots kept the Chargers out of the end zone and held them to fewer than 210 total yards.The offense didn't light up the scoreboard, but Drake Maye was impressive in his first career postseason start, throwing for 268 yards and rushing for 66 more. The Patriots are headed to the divisional round for the first time since 2018.Monday, Jan. 12(5) Texans 30-6 over (4) SteelersTexans vs. Steelers recap. The Texans had the best defense in the NFL during the regular season, and that unit carried them to a win against Pittsburgh. The Texans defense sacked Aaron Rodgers four times, held the Steelers to just 175 yards and scored two touchdowns, which both came in the fourth quarter. The first one came on a 33-yard fumble return by Sheldon Rankins, and then Calen Bullock followed that up with a 50-yard pick-six with just 2:39 left in the game. It was a defensive masterpiece by a Texans team that picked up its first road win in franchise history. Divisional RoundSaturday, Jan. 17(6) Bills at (1) Broncos, 4:30 p.m. ET (CBS, Paramount+)(6) 49ers at (1) Seahawks, 8 p.m. ET (Fox; Fubo, try for free)Sunday, Jan. 18(5) Texans at (2) Patriots, 3 p.m. ET (ESPN/ABC; Fubo, try for free)(5) Rams at (2) Bears, 6:30 p.m. ET (NBC)Championship SundaySunday, Jan. 25\nAFC Championship, 3 p.m. ET (CBS, Paramount+)NFC Championship, 6:30 p.m. ET (Fox; Fubo, try for free)Super Bowl LXSunday, Feb. 8AFC champion vs. NFC champion at Levi's Stadium (Santa Clara, California), 6:30 p.m. ET (NBC)\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

Well, that has aged rather poorly. Anaheim has since cratered, and the team now sits outside the postseason.On Nov. 19, the Ducks were 13-6-1 and occupied first place in the Pacific Division. Thanks to an abhorrent 3-9-2 stretch over the last month, Anaheim is now outside the playoffs entirely, left to fight for a wild card spot with the rest of the Western Conference riff raff.So, what went wrong? How did our beloved -- and once mighty -- Ducks fall so fast? For starters, the player driving that success has hit a wall. At one point this season, Leo Carlsson was atop the NHL scoring charts, alongside players like Nathan MacKinnon and Macklin Celebrini. Since Dec. 13, Carlsson has one goal and four assists in 13 games. That won't get it done.On top of that, the team's defensive issues have finally come home to roost. The Ducks bleed expected goals against at the fifth-highest rate in the NHL. While the offense is able to make up for a lot of that, Anaheim's defense gives up too much for the team to hang around near the top of the standings.The other major issue is that goaltender Lukas Dostal, who got off to a strong start like every other Duck, has been trending in the wrong direction. He's now allowed 6.57 goals above average, which is 76th in the league.As the Ducks tumble, here are the updated NHL Power Rankings.\nExpected goals and goals saved above average data via Natural Stat Trick.\n        Biggest Movers\n    \n                8\n            \n                Golden Knights\n            \n                8\n            \n                Senators\n            RkTeams\n                    ChgRcrd\n                                1\n                            \n                                    Avalanche\n                                \n                            Brock Nelson has been a terrific No. 2 center spot for the Avs. He's on pace for 40 goals, which would be a new career high at the age of 34.

    "body": "\n        The Pittsburgh Steelers will conduct just their third coaching search since 1969 after Mike Tomlin stepped down Tuesday, concluding 19 seasons at the helm. Team owner Art Rooney II will lead the search along with general manager Omar Khan, and Rooney told reporters Wednesday he was prepared to \"take another run\" with Tomlin in 2026, but the coach decided it was time to step away.Rooney thanked Tomlin for his nearly two decades of service to the organization and said he wasn't \"shocked\" by the news, which he described as \"more of a family-related decision than a football decision.\"\"It was his decision, and I will say that I wasn't shocked but I wasn't expecting that conversation yesterday either,\" Rooney said. \"... I was certainly willing to take another run at it next year with Mike, and that was what I was expecting to talk about yesterday but it went in another direction.\" Tomlin's contract with the Steelers ran through next season, meaning Pittsburgh still holds his rights and any team wanting to hire Tomlin would have to trade for him. Rooney said he did not believe that would happen given how Tomlin described his decision, including his desire to spend more time at home. Multiple outlets have reported that Tomlin does not plan to coach next season.\n\"Mike indicated that he did not anticipate coaching in the near future,\" Rooney said. \"I think he wants to spend time with his family and do the things he hasn't been able to do for the last, many years. So if something like that comes up, we'll deal with it when it comes up, but it doesn't seem like something on his radar.\" \n        \n            \n                Mike Tomlin stepping away could give the Steelers the reset they need. It'll be easier said than done\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nRooney: Steelers will have 'open mind' in coaching searchAs for the next coach in Pittsburgh, Rooney insisted he and the organization will go into the search with an open mind. Rooney was asked what he remembered from the past searches given the Steelers haven't had many. He noted that Tomlin would not have landed the job had they not gone into that process willing to earnestly listen to each candidate that came in. \"I've been involved in a number of searches going back to coach [Bill] Cowher and GM searches,\" Rooney said. \"I think if I've learned anything about searches it's to have an open mind. We had Mike in for his first interview, certainly wasn't expecting him to be our head coach. I think you go through the process and be diligent and hopefully come out with the right guy.\" \nThe most important quality for Rooney and the Steelers is leadership. The ability to motivate players and command their respect -- hallmarks of Tomlin's tenure -- remains vital for Pittsburgh's next coach, Rooney said. \"I think there are a lot of things that go into being a successful head coach,\" Rooney said. \"No. 1 in my mind is leadership and trusting this person can step up in front of the team day in and day out and hold their attention and have them motivated to do what they do. That's the most important.\" \n        \n            \n                What's next for Mike Tomlin: Are Browns, Ravens possible landing spots for former Steelers coach?\n                \n                    Bryan DeArdo                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAs for who the candidates will be, Rooney wouldn't divulge any names, but he did make it plainly clear that none of the current Steelers staff is on his radar for the head-coaching role -- a statement that seems to rule out offensive coordinator and former Falcons coach Arthur Smith as a candidate. \n\"Right now I don't think anybody on our staff is a candidate,\" Rooney said. \"Maybe a candidate to stay on the staff depending on what the new head coach wants to do, but probably not as a head coach.\" Tomlin went all 19 years in charge without a losing season, but some Steelers fans are hopeful for a reset with an infusion of young talent into the roster. That doesn't seem like the plan in Pittsburgh based on Rooney's comments when asked about the expectations for a new coach. \"The standard is to try to compete to win a championship each year,\" Rooney said. \"... I'm not gonna say, well, we're gonna take a couple years to figure this out and then you try to compete. I think you try every year and, as I said, some years you have the horses to really get there and some you don't. But you try every year, in my view.\" \nWhat's next for Aaron Rodgers?With 42-year-old Aaron Rodgers on board as quarterback, the Steelers went 10-7 and won the AFC North in dramatic fashion before losing to the Houston Texans in the wild card round on Monday. Rodgers spoke glowingly of Tomlin through the season and Rooney was honest about how Tomlin's departure could impact Rodgers' future.\"Yeah, Aaron came here to play for Mike,\" Rooney said. \"So it'll likely impact his decision.\"Rodgers signed a one-year deal with the Steelers in the offseason and played at a high level following a rough two-year stint with the New York Jets. In 16 games, Rodgers threw for 3,322 yards, 24 touchdowns and seven interceptions while completing 65.7% of his attempts. Many expect Rodgers to retire, but if he does look to return to the field in 2026, Tomlin's departure could certainly cause him to look elsewhere. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Miami has learned the hard way that quarterback certainty is a luxury, not a given. That lesson crystallized this week when Alabama quarterback Ty Simpson filed paperwork to remain in the 2026 NFL Draft -- confirmed by CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz -- officially removing one of the Hurricanes' most intriguing contingency plans from the board.The move sent ripples through the industry. Miami, staring down a national championship opportunity and an uncertain future at the most important position in football, is not inclined to sit quietly and assume the solution is already in-house.No. 10 Miami will face No. 1 Indiana on Monday night in the College Football Playoff National Championship at Hard Rock Stadium, a surreal setting that underscores both how quickly the program has risen and how fragile that ascent can be without the right quarterback. Over the past two seasons, the Hurricanes have leaned aggressively on veteran transfers to fuel their climb, pulling off moves few programs can match.Miami convinced Cam Ward to withdraw from the 2024 NFL Draft, a decision that ultimately led to him becoming the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft. The Hurricanes followed that by landing Carson Beck, who reversed course after initially declaring for the draft following four seasons at Georgia.\nBoth moves were transfer-portal coups. Both were calculated risks. And both worked exactly as intended.That success is precisely why Miami has turned the quarterback market into a high-alert zone. Simpson was viewed as a potential next target, but that door is now firmly closed -- even after he turned down multiple offers \"north of $4 million,\" including one reported $6.5 million package, according to AL.com.\n        \n            \n                Big offseason moves by Miami, Indiana keyed CFP National Championship run for Hoosiers, Hurricanes\n                \n                    Shehan Jeyarajah                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThis is not a staff content to let the board come to it. Miami is exploring every option, including quarterbacks not yet in the portal, with less than 72 hours remaining before the transfer window closes Friday night. Any school that currently rosters a top-20 quarterback in college football would be smart to make sure the ink is dry on their contract -- Washington having all the leverage in the Demond Williams Jr. saga is the only reason he is headed back to Seattle (and not perhaps to Miami). Standing still at quarterback is the fastest way to slip out of national championship contention.\nDespite having bodies in the room, Miami understands it lacks a proven answer for 2026.True freshman Luke Nickel, a four-star recruit and the No. 16 quarterback in the 2025 class, has attempted just one collegiate pass -- an incompletion against NC State. Redshirt sophomore Emory Williams has experience but limited production, totaling 813 passing yards, four touchdowns and two interceptions across 12 appearances and two starts. It's possible Williams would explore the transfer portal if Miami lands another veteran quarterback. Redshirt freshman Judd Anderson and incoming freshman Deron Coleman, both three-star prospects, round out the depth chart.It is a quarterback room. It is not an answer for a program playing for a national title and expecting to remain in the CFP conversation annually.\nThat urgency helps explain why missing on portal targets stings more now than it would have a year ago. Arizona State transfer Sam Leavitt committed to LSU days after visiting Miami. Dylan Raiola, once linked to the Hurricanes, signed with Oregon. USC transfer Husan Longstreet was the best available quarterback option before also signing with LSU on Wednesday, Zenitz and Chris Hummer reported.The numbers are not in Miami's favor. Only two of the top 30 transfer quarterbacks in Cooper Petagna's 247Sports portal rankings remain uncommitted, but Penn State transfer Ethan Grunkemeyer is widely expected to follow James Franklin to Virginia Tech. Tennessee transfer Jake Merklinger, ranked No. 27, is the only other option without a landing spot.That raises an uncomfortable question Miami must confront now rather than later: What happens if the Hurricanes get this close to their first national championship since 2001 only to slide backward after striking out at quarterback?\nThe program has masked development gaps by landing ready-made answers through the portal. The approach has worked, but it is inherently volatile. The Simpson situation serves as a reminder that not every quarterback can be pried loose, regardless of resources or pitch. Sometimes the timing does not align. Sometimes the paperwork shuts the door.Miami is not panicking.The Hurricanes know exactly what they are: a national contender with high-level talent throughout the roster. They also know what they cannot afford to become: a program close enough to touch a title, only to reset because it ran out of options at quarterback.That is why the phones remain active. And why, even as Miami prepares to play for a national championship in its own backyard, the Hurricanes are already looking ahead to 2026.\nNo assumptions. No complacency. Because at Miami, the margin between staying elite and slipping back into the pack is one quarterback decision away.\n            ",

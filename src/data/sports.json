    "body": "\n        American striker Folarin Balogun seems to have finally arrived at Monaco in his third season with the club. Scoring an important goal in their 2-2 draw with Pafos in Champions League play on Wednesday, Balogun has now scored in his last five starts for club and country, and it couldn't come at a better time with the 2026 World Cup only 197 days away. Last season was almost a lost one for Balogun as shoulder and ankle injuries kept him out of the fold for the French side, but he's hitting the ground running and has already surpassed his goal output in all competitions last season with six goals and two assists for Monaco.Balogun is firing the club up the league phase table and growing in confidence in his own game, getting the experience of both leading the line by himself and playing alongside another striker when he partners Danish forward Mika Biereth. That flexibility has helped Balogun use his movement and creative skill to the best of his abilities, which has seen him become a well-rounded striker at only 24 years old.His goal against Pafos showed Balogun's defensive acumen as well as his finishing. Intercepting the ball, Balgogun didn't need much time to think of what he was going to do next, firing a first-time finish past Neophytos Michael in the net.\nThese are the kind of finishes that confident strikers take, and it's taken quite a bit for Balogun to get to this point. After starring for Reims, scoring 22 goals in all competitions, during the 2022-23 season, the American forward earned a move to Monaco and showed promise with eight goals and seven assists in his first season with the club. But with last season being an injury-riddled one, Balogun was unable to build on that promise. \nYear three, he's found his role, and it's coming just in time ahead of a World Cup on home soil. Christian Pulisic has long been the key attacker for the United States men's national team, but after committing to represent the Red, White, and Blue instead of England, Balogun is bringing a different look to the attack. The nine has long been a question for the USMNT since the days of Jozy Altidore leading the line -- and in some ways even while he was leading it -- but as the calendar gets ready to flip to 2026, Balogun is offering reasons to hope for success in 2026 both for club and country. Getting this Champions League experience and thriving in it will only better prepare Balogun for the World Cup. \nThere's a long way to go between now and then, but it has been quite a while since an American striker was performing at this level on Europe's biggest stage. Ricoardo Pepi has had his moments for PSV, but most of that has been coming off the bench, compared to Balogun being relied on from the start of matches. That does make a difference, as so far Balogun has thrived under pressure and that'll only increase in the next year as games become even more important for club and country. \n            ",

Only Lamine Yamal at 17 years and 68 days and Ansu Fati at 17 years and 40 days have accomplished the feat at a younger age than the Kairat man. You'd think, oh, teams around the world may take notice to enter a bidding war for him, but back in February, Chelsea got ahead of the race, signing him to a deal for €4 million with add-ons ons which is a transfer record for the Kazakhstan Premier League. The global market may move quickly, but Chelsea's scouts move faster when it comes to finding future talent. Satpayev will remain at Kairat on loan until August of 2026, before then moving to the Premier League side. He made his senior debut at 15 and has quickly become the hottest prospect in Kazakhstan and could also become the first player ever from the country to feature in the Premier League. Given what he's done in the Champions League this season, there's reason as to why he may. Only 10 teenagers have scored in Champions League play this season, and four are on Chelsea's books.Teenagers to score in the UCL this seasonNameAgeClubNumber of goalsEstevao18Chelsea3Lamine Yamal18Barcelona2Geovany Quenda18Sporting CP2Viktor Dadason17Copenhagen2Lennart Karl17Bayern Munich2Tyrique George19Chelsea1Marc Guiu19Chelsea1Senny Mayulu19Paris Saint-Germain1Dastan Satpayev17Kairat Almaty 1Christian Kofane19Bayer Leverkusen1The Blues are in a place where they could be set for seasons to come with the young talent already in the side and on the way in the future. This is without even taking a look at who the next players are that could be coming from Strasbourg in France, under the same ownership, where 18-year-old Kendry Paez is currently getting acclimated to European soccer.\nSatpayev has speed and can finish with both feet, while he's already getting experience of playing against sides like Real Madrid. Already with 19 goals and eight assists in all competitions at only 17, it's easy to see why the Blues would look to get a deal done quickly and adding even more talent to a club that's already second in the Premier League. Enzo Maresca has also brought along youth well, and it'll pay dividends as Chelsea continues to turn into a force. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher said he's \"really angry with the players\" following the team's 4-1 defeat to PSV in the UEFA Champions League on Tuesday, a loss that extends their losing streak to three games and was their fifth in their last seven matches across all competitions.In the Reds' latest defeat, they were dominant with 63.1% possession and outshot PSV 27-9 but a look beneath the surface reveals a series of problems that have plagued the Premier League champions all season. The combination of their inefficient attack and their vulnerable defense meant they were essentially even on expected goals with the visitors, barely edging them out by a margin of 2.76 to 2.22. Liverpool's imperfections only exacerbated things, leading to yet another lopsided loss in a string of them.Pressure has begun to mount on manager Arne Slot, who has yet to find a solution to his problems but Carragher does not want to call time on his stint in charge of the team.\"LIverpool's not a sacking club,\" Carragher said during the UEFA Champions League Today post-match show. \"Liverpool, I think, are different from almost every club in European football where the manager is the king. The managers get time. Liverpool have never sacked a manager who's won the league. Never in the history. They all go after a few years. They've gone, they've resigned. I couldn't believe at the weekend that people were talking about the manager's job when I spoke to Liverpool supporters after losing at home to Nottingham Forest. It's only going to amplify now and I've always been in the camp of you stick with the manager.\"\nCarragher believes the problem is bigger than the manager, Liverpool's defeats the result of the club's inability to evolve after Jurgen Klopp's refresh of the team before they won the Champions League in 2019 and the Premier League the following season.\"I think what you see now is Liverpool in 2018 under Klopp starts this sort of journey of being a great team and then Slot comes in and we're now, what are we, seven or eight years later?,\" Carragher said. \"The catalyst for Liverpool at the very start of that run was Alisson, [Virgil] van Dijk and [Mohamed] Salah. Alisson's injured a lot, now he doesn't play so much but you're watching van Dijk now, not the same player and Mo Salah looks like his legs have gone.\"Carragher has felt criticism of Salah and Van Dijk this season has been harsh, shifting his focus to their teammates who have not stepped up as the veterans enter their post-peak years.\n\"I'm angry with the players, if I'm being totally honest. I'm really angry with the players,\" Carragher said. \"I've been critical of Mo Salah off the pitch. I want him to come out and do an interview tonight and speak to the Liverpool players about what the players are going to do, what's going on in the dressing room, giving the supporters hope that things are going to improve but I don't like criticizing them on the pitch because they're absolute legendary, what they've done and the legs have just gone, especially with Salah. Van Dijk now can't help other players. He needs help himself and that just means he's a normal center back like I was at one stage. Maybe he's not superhuman now but they've been that good for the football club. I look at some of the others – step up. Can you only play well when they play well? Their seasons last season were off the scale and everybody else enjoyed that, winning the league and they're all league champions and they've got it on the CV and great but when they're not there, where are they? Where are the others?\"Liverpool midfielder Curtis Jones took a similar tone in a post-match interview with broadcasters, regretting the fact that trips to Anfield feel approachable for opposing teams these days.\"This starts with just wanting to be a man out there and you're just wanting to tackle someone and just be a dog out there and it's not always the fact that we've got these lads who are nice on the ball and we just play and play and play,\" Jones said. \"Like, go and smash someone and it's coming from me, as well. I'm not saying the other lads have to go out and do it because I'm the same. I'm in the exact same boat that the lads are looking at me as well say, 'Go on, then. Smash someone,' so it's got to be on me and the rest of the lads to change this around, to not be so nice where teams are coming here thinking, 'I'm going to win here. We're going to score two, three, four goals.' You come in here and this used to be a place that you hated to come, with the fans, with how we played and how we go and press and we're just absolute dogs and then we have the ball and then we play whereas now, we hardly even play. There's times when we play but off the ball stuff, I think that's the stuff that has to change.\"\nCarragher took his argument one step further, though, making the case that Liverpool's squad as a whole may not be equipped to challenge for titles on the regular – and may not have been last season, either.\"In terms of the players and the way they are performing now, that is not acceptable for Liverpool Football Club and I actually think – and maybe I thought this last season,\" Carragher said. \"Are some of them good enough for Liverpool if Liverpool want to win the biggest trophies? We saw them at Newcastle [United] in the Carabao Cup. We saw them against [Paris Saint-Germain] away from home last season. I mean, woeful performances and they've been carried by some of the greatest players the club have ever had. This is maybe a snapshot of the future of Liverpool when Mo Salah moves on, when Virgil van Dijk moves on and Alisson moves on.\"\n            ",

Rendon, who missed the entire 2025 season after undergoing hip surgery in February, is expected to retire if a deal can be reached.Rendon, 35, agreed to a seven-year pact worth $245 million after winning the 2019 World Series as a member of the Washington Nationals. At the time, he was rightly viewed as one of the best at his position. In the preceding four seasons, he had averaged 26 home runs, 100 runs batted in, and a .912 OPS. His contributions had been worth an estimated 22.9 Wins Above Replacement, per the calculations housed at Baseball Reference.\nYet that version of Rendon rarely showed up for the Angels, instead dealing with constant injuries that, in recent years, required operations on both hips. To wit, Rendon had notched just 3.9 WAR in 257 games since joining the Angels. That works out to fewer than 43 games per campaign (though, to be fair, he did appear 52 of the Angels' 60 games during the pandemic-shortened 2020 season). \nAngels general manager Perry Minasian revealed in October that Rendon had yet to resume baseball activities -- a less-than-promising sign for his chances of returning to the active roster.ESPN's report indicates that if the Angels and Rendon can agree to terms on a buyout, part of the arrangement is expected to see him defer some of the money owed to him. That would, in turn, create additional financial flexibility for the Angels to deploy this winter.\nIn Rendon's absence last season, the Angels started Yoán Moncada and Luis Rengifo more than 50 times apiece at the hot corner. Both Moncada and Rengifo are now free agents. \n            \n    ",

Specifics about the injury were not disclosed in the school's announcement, but a Connors State spokesperson told multiple outlets that Dietz, 20, suffered a head injury in the game. \"The Cowboy family has suffered an unimaginable loss,\" the school said in a statement. \"As you know, sophomore Ethan Dietz was injured during a men's basketball game on Saturday.

The 6-foot-8 forward was a starter for the Cowboys who averaged 11 points and 9.4 rebounds per game on the season. Dietz also started 29 of the Cowboys' 36 games last year as a freshman.\"Ethan Dietz was the kind of player a coach always hopes for,\" Connors State coach and athletic director Bill Muse said. \"He was talented athletically and academically and he understood the importance of hard work. If you ever saw him smile, you knew he was all heart. He was a person of character as well as a great teammate. Our hearts and prayers continue to be with Ethan's family, friends and our team as we process this heartbreaking loss.\"Connors State canceled its upcoming games against Southern Arkansas University Tech on Wednesday, Nov. 26, and against Grayson College on Monday, Dec. 1, in the wake of the tragedy. The women's basketball team also canceled its next two games.\"It is devastating when such a bright light is taken from us,\" Connors State president Dr. Ron Ramming said. \"Ethan exemplified what it means to be a Cowboy, to value hard work and being part of a team. While we are processing our own grief, our hearts go out to his family, friends and teammates.\"Connors State will hold an on-campus vigil in Dietz's honor on Monday, Dec. 1, at 7 p.m.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        We're now 13 weeks deep into the NFL season, and each and every game is taking on added importance as we get later and later into the year. And while it's true that every single game technically matters just as much as any other when it comes to determining who will make the playoffs (or win tiebreakers or have a better draft selection) and have a chance to vie for the right to take the Lombardi Trophy away from the Eagles, there are some matchups that stand out above the others. And this year's Thanksgiving day slate has a few of them. As an annual tradition, the Detroit Lions and Dallas Cowboys will host games on Thanksgiving afternoon. But we've also got a potential barn-burner of a prime-time game on tap -- and it looks like we'll get some good news on the injury front for Joe Burrow. Read on below for details on the 2025 Thanksgiving slate.Green Bay Packers at Detroit LionsDate: Nov. 27 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: Ford Field (Detroit, MI)TV: Fox | Streaming: fubo\nThis is a much-anticipated rematch of the Week 1 game wherein the Packers absolutely laid the smack down on the Lions. Detroit will surely have revenge on its mind for this one, while Green Bay will be looking to pull off another win and stake a claim to the division title.The Lions have played more Thanksgiving games than any other team, playing 85 times since 1934. They're 38-45-2 all time, but they finally got a win last year after losing each season from 2017 through 2023. Last year's game, of course, was notable for the clock-management abomination that resulted in then-Bears coach Matt Eberflus (now the defensive coordinator for the Cowboys) being fired. For the Lions, this game is part of a tough post-bye week schedule, wherein they play the Vikings (loss), Commanders (win), Eagles, Giants, Packers, Cowboys and Rams all in a row. That game against Dallas the week after Thanksgiving is also on \"Thursday Night Football.\"\nThe Packers, as many know, were once the Lions' annual opponent on Thanksgiving, playing them every year from 1951 through 1963. In their 38 total Thanksgiving games, the Packers are 16-20-2. They last played on Thanksgiving, well, last year. They beat the Dolphins 30-13 in the prime-time game. This will actually mark their third straight Thanksgiving game, as they played and beat the Lions 29-22 back in 2023. The game comes in the middle of a tough divisional stretch for the Packers, who play the Vikings in Week 12, Detroit in Week 13 and the Bears in Week 14. Kansas City Chiefs at Dallas CowboysDate: Nov. 27 | Time: 4:30 p.m. ETLocation: AT&T Stadium (Arlington, TX)TV: CBS | Streaming: Paramount+\nEven though the Cowboys are already only on the absolute fringes of playoff contention, this game is going to do monster viewership numbers. Dallas is always a ratings factory and the Chiefs are, right now, probably the second-biggest draw in the NFL -- and that's only if they haven't actually surpassed the Cowboys.Oh, and it should be a fascinating football matchup absolutely loaded with stars on both sides of the ball. Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce, Chris Jones, Rashee Rice, Dak Prescott, CeeDee Lamb, George Pickens, Quinnen Williams and more all on the same field at the same time? Yes, please. Sign me up.Dallas has played 57 Thanksgiving games in its history and has compiled a 34-22-1 all-time record. The Cowboys have won three Thanksgiving games in a row, with each of those victories coming against a divisional opponent: the Giants twice and Washington once. The last time they lost on Thanksgiving was in 2021, when they lost an overtime game to the Las Vegas Raiders while playing without both Lamb and Amari Cooper. \nThis game is part of a hellacious end-of-season sprint for the Cowboys, who face the Eagles, Chiefs, Lions, Vikings and Chargers all in a row before closing out the season against the Commanders and Giants.\n        \n            \n                Chiefs vs. Cowboys prediction: Can Patrick Mahomes keep pace with Dak Prescott and the potent Dallas offense?\n                \n                    Douglas Clawson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nKansas City is 5-5 in its 10 Thanksgiving contests, but has not played on the holiday since 2006, when Larry Johnson rushed for 157 yards to lead the Chiefs to a win over the division-rival Broncos. That was also the first year that the league played a Thursday night game on Thanksgiving in addition to the games hosted by the Lions and Cowboys. The last time the Cowboys and Chiefs played on Thanksgiving was in 1995, with the Cowboys prevailing 24-12 behind an 11-catch, 121-yard game from Michael Irvin.\nCincinnati Bengals at Baltimore RavensDate: Nov. 27 | Time: 8:20 p.m. ETLocation: M&T Bank StadiumTV: NBC\nHere we have another big divisional matchup to match the one that gets the day started. The Bengals and Ravens played two of the most entertaining games of the 2024 season, and here's hoping we get treated to a rematch on Thanksgiving night. At the very least, here's hoping we get to see Joe Burrow back in action for this game, as Week 13 has been targeted as a potential return date for the injured quarterback. (Even if we don't, the Joe Flacco-led Bengals offense is pretty exciting, and could provide some fireworks here.)The Bengals have played just one Thanksgiving game in their history, losing 26-10 to the Jets in 2010 in what was a rematch of the playoff game the two teams played the year before. The Bengals have an interesting stretch of schedule beginning with this game, as they travel to Baltimore before heading to Buffalo to take on the Bills and then return home to host the Ravens again in Week 15.The Ravens have played just twice on Thanksgiving, winning each of their games in 2011 and 2013. The last time they played was when they took on the Steelers back in 2013, with the Ravens entering as the defending Super Bowl champions. Baltimore hosts the Steelers in between these two games against Cincinnati. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        It's been an interesting Heisman Trophy year to say the least. Eight different players have been favorites or co-favorites to win the award entering any week this season, which are the most such players in any season since at least 2012, according to CBS Sports Research. Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza has been a favorite to win college football's top award for the majority of the season, but there are several other players who can make strong arguments for themselves. That includes the signal-caller that found himself atop CBS Sports' most recent top 50 quarterback rankings. Vanderbilt's Diego Pavia had a senior day to remember last week, as he set career highs in completion percentage (84.6%), passing yards (484), total yards (532) and total touchdowns (6) in Vandy's 45-17 rout of the Kentucky Wildcats. He became the first Vanderbilt player in the last 30 years to score at least four total touchdowns in three straight games, and has the Commodores hoping for a College Football Playoff berth.Vanderbilt has won nine games in the regular season for the first time since 1915, and that's in large part due to the quarterback. Pavia has energized if not resurrected this football program, and is undoubtedly one of the best and most notable players in college football. But should he be the favorite to win the Heisman? During a recent taping of \"Hot Mic w/ Hutton & Withrow,\" Pavia was asked why he deserves this award.\n\"Well, the Heisman Trophy winner goes to the best player in college football,\" Pavia said. \"I believe that to be myself, you check the numbers and especially -- there's two things that don't lie to you: Numbers and tape. I've been taught that since I was young, you go check that out. I feel like I'm undoubtedly the best player in college football.\"Current Heisman Trophy Odds, via FanDuel SportsbookPlayerOddsQB Fernando Mendoza, Indiana-125QB Julian Sayin, Ohio State+400RB Jeremiyah Love, Notre Dame+450QB Diego Pavia, Vanderbilt+650QB Marcel Reed, Texas A&M+1500QB Gunner Stockton, Georgia+5000Vanderbilt is the only current Power Four team without a 10-win season, and that could change with a win over rival Tennessee on Saturday. The Commodores need a win and some additional help if they want to make the Playoff. Pavia is averaging 265.8 passing yards per game, and has thrown 26 touchdowns compared to six interceptions this season. His 33 total touchdowns rank No. 1 in the SEC.\nNo Vanderbilt player has ever won the Heisman, but Pavia is certainly in the conversation. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Liverpool's downward spiral hasn't shown signs of stopping. The Reds have now lost four of their last six games at Anfield after losing 4-1 to PSV on Wednesday in Champions League league phase play. Heading into Thanksgiving, the Reds are not only in the bottom half of the Premier League behind their rivals Everton, but they're also dropping down the UCL table as the hand has to be approaching the panic button.All hope isn't lost as the Reds will end Matchday 5 in 12th in the Champions League league phase, but pressure is growing on Arne Slot. He has a bit of a leash after winning the Premier League last season, but time waits for no one, especially when the managerial crop this coming summer could include names like Thomas Tuchel, Julian Nagelsmann, and Mauricio Pochettino after the World Cup is complete. Despite taking 27 shots and putting nine on target, it never felt like Liverpool were in the game after Ivan Perisic's penalty went in in the sixth minute of play. Once the Reds fall behind, it used to feel inevitable that they'd come back with four match winners coming after the 90th minute of play this season, but getting in that situation week after week can break a team. It seems like time is catching up to Mohamed Salah, and the attack has failed to find its balance while the defense has struggled. This season, Liverpool have already allowed an xG of at least 2.0 three times in all competitions, losing all of those matches. Last season, in 56 matches played, they only allowed an xG of that level five times, losing three and drawing two. Slot's had to deal with injuries to key players like Allison, but last season's Liverpool were a big red machine, and that hasn't been the case following a summer of exorbitant spending, which included key attacking signings like Hugo Ekitike, Florian Wirtz, and Alexander Isak.\nThe trio have had their moments, but it still hasn't been good enough for Liverpool to follow up on their success and season two under Slot is coming with some of the pitfalls that were expected in replacing Jurgen Klopp in his first season in charge. The Reds haven't responded well to adversity, and they don't have much time to turn things around this season. Already 11 points behind Arsenal, only 12 matches into the season, any hopes of retaining the Premier League title are all but gone, and while there have been highs, such as defeating Real Madrid 1-0 in the Champions League, without a repeatable system, there's no way that they'll be able to win this competition either. It'd be one thing if these performances were happening every once in a while, but when it's week after week after week, that's when concern grows, and CBS Sports analyst and former Liverpool player Jamie Carragher is concerned about the future of the club.\n\"I think what you see now is that Liverpool in 2018 under Klopp starts this sort of DNA of being a great team, and then slot comes in, and what are we seven or eight years later? The catalyst for Liverpool at the very start of that run was Alisson, [Virgil] Van Dijk, and Salah. Alisson's been injured a lot now, so he doesn't play so much. When you're watching Van Dijk now, he's not the same player, and Mo Salah looks like his legs have gone,\" Carragher said. \"I don't like criticizing them and I think some of the criticism of them this season as players has been harsh. You always look for your leaders in your team to step up when things aren't going well.\"\"Now, I've been critical of Mo Salah off the pitch. I want him to come out and do an interview tonight and speak to the Liverpool players about what the players are going to do, what's going on in the dressing room, giving the supporters hope that things are going to improve but I don't like criticizing them on the pitch because they're absolute legendary, what they've done and the legs have just gone, especially with Salah,\" Carragher continued. \"Van Dijk now can't help other players. He needs help himself and that just means he's a normal center back like I was at one stage. Maybe he's not superhuman now but they've been that good for the football club. I look at some of the others -- step up. Can you only play well when they play well? Their seasons last season were off the scale, and everybody else enjoyed that, winning the league and they're all league champions and they've got it on the CV and great but when they're not there, where are they? Where are the others?\"When looking at Liverpool's signings, this is a tough question to answer. Curtis Jones came out after the match saying that the team needs to fight more and be dogs out there, but when that's not how they've played under Slot, it's hard to do that overnight. The heavy metal football was toned down to something more pragmatic and with that, Liverpool have struggled to respond to adversity like what has come this season. If a response doesn't come soon, more change could be on the way because the Premier League operates on what a manager has done for a team lately, not how their entire career has progressed.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        LONDON -- You don't have to believe the bookmakers' odds. You can plead ignorance to Elo ratings. You might even choose to skip over all the tables that rank teams by how good they are at accruing points from football matches. You cannot, however, avoid the evidence that is clear to see in front of your eyes.Arsenal are the best team in the world right now. Of course they are. They've just done what the best team in Europe does, grinding one of their leading rivals into submission. Bayern Munich were lucky to only have three hung on them. Their goal, which was shaping up to be a consolation within 10 minutes of its scoring, required them to enact by far the most impressive attacking move of the match.A team who've just won on the road to the European champions routinely needed moments of peerless individual brilliance or a move where every component touch and player was 90th percentile. That was just to get into the penalty area. Bayern ended this game with their customary 60% possession. They also ended with nine touches in the Arsenal box. Harry Kane, whose presence only became apparent when the Emirates Stadium serenaded him, ended this game with fewer penalty box touches than Jurrien Timber.Bayern tried a lot and a lot of it was unsuccessful. Take the period before their out-of-the-blue equalizer, when Vincent Kompany appeared to conclude that his side just weren't going to get the better of their opponents in one-on-one duels. And so their positioning went deliberately haywire for a few passages. No matter when Konrad Laimer started moonlighting upfront or Kane did the whole England at a major tournament trick of abandoning the frontline. If Bukayo Saka had to play center back then Bukayo Saka played center back. William Saliba would charge forward and why not? He was as well off winning the ball in the Bayern third as Arsenal's.\n\"Individually, we were immense to resolve all the challenges that this team brings to the table,\" said Arteta. \"The energy that we created in the stadium, what the team transmits, the energy that we bring, the quality that we play with: it's incredible. We have to maintain that because it's still very early.\"Right the way through this game, the Arsenal machine was operating at peak efficiency. They have long since adapted to life without a center forward, on this occasion, rather than exploiting Mikel Merino's box-crashing qualities, they let him step back closer to Eberechi Eze and the indomitable triple pivot of Martin Zubimendi and two Declan Rices (wait, what?). Arteta wasn't looking to control possession, his side could control the positioning of Bayern even when they didn't have the ball at their feet. The center backs moved up and that created angles for the Gunners' wide men to fly into.That was what was so remarkable about this game. You wouldn't quite call it an off-finishing night from the hosts, who got three goals from 12 shots worth 2.72 xG, but they could have had more. Leandro Trossard's lob shot-cross produced nothing from a prime position. Had Eze shot when he passed in the first half, he might well have had a goal to follow up his derby hat trick. Even on an off night, Saka snapped on the heels of Bayern defenders, nearly forcing more than one prime shooting opportunity.\nThis was the best Arsenal have been in Arteta's tenure. Usually when a team reaches this level, everything has broken their way. They are not, for instance, down to their last Gabriel -- both Magalhaes and Jesus still working their way back to fitness. They have not played their last four and a half games without any center forward. Their captain, the technical heartbeat of their team, has played more than 266 minutes. The best team in the world doesn't lose its form attacker before half time and rip Bayern Munich to pieces. And yet here Arsenal were, having to adapt to the early exit of Trossard. No trouble, his replacement Noni Madueke delivered his first goal in the second half. This team may only just be emerging from a sustained run of difficulty with injuries but Arteta still has the strength in depth to turn the game, Riccardo Calafiori delivering the assist for Madueke with his first touch before fellow substitute Martinelli beat Manuel Neuer to Eze's ball over the top and tapped in. Now, of course, Bayern had selection issues of their own, a suspended Luis Diaz and injuries to Alphonso Davies and Jamal Musiala, but Kompany has not been bequeathed the strength in depth that Arteta has.The Arsenal boss would doubtless rather park the warm notices he and his players get. His press conference was notably taciturn for a man who has blitzed an opponent he labelled \"the best team in Europe.\" He would have no truck with questions as to what that made the side who just beat them. Kompany reflected why his counterpart was so taciturn. \n\"Mikel won't mind if I say, we had this discussion when we played PSG three or four weeks ago. I don't think any of us want to be the best team in November,\" he said. Perhaps in six months' time the status quo will have changed. Plug better fullbacks into the Bayern XI, not least a full fit Davies, and they could become a better defensive force. If Paris Saint-Germain find the fitness they had in the last run in, then they will not fear Arsenal.As Arteta himself put it, this is \"just the beginning.\" That might be an attempt to dampen expectations, but unfortunately for him, it might only serve to raise them. Right now, Arsenal are the best in the field. And they're only just getting started.\n            ",

For detailed rationale, check out my latest content, including my weekly Lineup Decisions column.                      What do the numbers mean?\nAll of my analyses from the week, from data points to matchup outlooks to game-flow predictions, are basically represented by a number on a confidence scale from 1-10. The higher the number next to a player's name, the more confident I am that you should start him. The numbers are not a projection, just a confidence score to help you pick who to start. Every relevant player for this week is here, so if a player isn't listed, don't start him.                      To find a specific player, use your search function -- CTRL-F on PCs and Command-F on Macs. If neither of those are options, or if you're on a mobile device, you can scroll by game. If you're still unsure, just send a note on X.com (@daverichard) and I'll give it a look, time permitting. Remember to use the #AskFFT hashtag!                      If you're reading this on Sunday, please refer to our weekly rankings, which are updated in real time.                  Ready to get off on the right foot?

For detailed rationale, check out my latest content, including my weekly Lineup Decisions column.                      What do the numbers mean?\nAll of my analyses from the week, from data points to matchup outlooks to game-flow predictions, are basically represented by a number on a confidence scale from 1-10. The higher the number next to a player's name, the more confident I am that you should start him. The numbers are not a projection, just a confidence score to help you pick who to start. Every relevant player for this week is here, so if a player isn't listed, don't start him.                      To find a specific player, use your search function -- CTRL-F on PCs and Command-F on Macs. If neither of those are options, or if you're on a mobile device, you can scroll by game.

    "body": "\n        \r\nTuesday in Vegas at the Players Era Festival -- which saw Tennessee down Houston and gave us Gonzaga and Michigan blowout wins over Maryland and Auburn, respectively -- was but an appetizer to the main course set for Wednesday as we wrap the week from Sin City.   \r\n\r\n\r\nThe spread on tap includes Iowa State (unbeaten on the season and 2-0 this week) taking on Syracuse (0-2 on the week) in the early window and concludes late with a 10:30 p.m. ET tip between Baylor and San Diego State. In between, we have the third-place game between Tennessee and Kansas at 7 p.m. ET and the first place game between Gonzaga and Michigan headlining action at 9:30 p.m. ET. The winner of that game earns an additional $1 million prize. There are also financial prizes to be had for runner-up, third-place and fourth-place finishers.   \r\n\r\n\r\nSo clearly: There's plenty at stake -- to say nothing of the potential NCAA Tournament implications down the line -- setting us up for what should be a fantastic finish. And so to celebrate the basketball bonanza I've convened our experts to make picks for every game from Vegas both straight up and against the spread.    \r\n\r\n\r\nThose picks are below.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\tOdds via DraftKings Sportsbook | All times ET                                      \r\n\n\r\n   No. 14 St. John's vs. No. 21 Auburn   \r\n\n\r\n\t8 p.m. on truTV: This is my upset pick of the day and underdog I'm willing to ride. I'll admit: It feels like shaky ground to stand on given the way Michigan clobbered the Tigers, 102-72, on Tuesday.

This Zags team looks like a wagon right now and it is bludgeoning teams with a scoring margin through seven games that is second-highest in college basketball. Coming off a 39-point beatdown of Maryland on Tuesday I'm laying the points with the better team. Pick: Gonzaga -2.5 -- Boone   \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n   \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\nZAGS -2.5\r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n   \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Gonzaga\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Gonzaga\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nSTRAIGHT-UP\r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n   \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Gonzaga\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Gonzaga\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n                Baylor vs. San Diego State                   \r\n\n\r\n\t10:30 p.m. on truTV: Baylor struggled defensively vs. St. John's on Tuesday but still managed 81 points in a shootout as Cam Carr continued his big week with 27 points. I'm expecting SDSU to be a more manageable matchup for this brand-new Bears team as they figure out their pieces, and their ability to score consistently -- even if the defense is a mess right now -- should be enough to get them by in a close one. Pick: Baylor -2.5 -- Boone   \r\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n   \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\nBAY -2.5\r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Baylor\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n   \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Baylor\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            San Diego St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Baylor\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Baylor\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nSTRAIGHT-UP\r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Baylor\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n   \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Baylor\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            San Diego St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Baylor\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Baylor\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n   No. 8 Alabama vs. Maryland   \r\n\n\r\n\t12 a.m. on TNT: Maryland's 39-point beatdown at the hands of Gonzaga on Tuesday surely opened the eyes of the Terps.

That's the perils of an event that has criteria for sorting matchups on scoring differential. The basketball gods will shine upon ISU, though, and I predict this team will be motivated to prove a point that its exclusion from the prize fight -- criteria be damned -- was an oversight. Pick: Iowa State -10.5 -- Boone   \r\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n   \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\nISU -10.5\r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n   \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Syracuse\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Syracuse\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nSTRAIGHT-UP\r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n   \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n                No. 3 Houston vs. Notre Dame                   \r\n\n\r\n\t3:30 p.m. on TNT: The Houston we've seen in Vegas this week is not the Houston I predict we will see in March when it is firing on all cylinders.

The Jayhawks are playing well defensively and smashing teams on the boards. Whether they can keep that up against Tennessee -- which wins in similar fashion -- is TBD. But I'm not writing off KU as a potential upset in this one. Pick: Kansas +5.5 -- Boone \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n   \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\nTENN -5.5\r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kansas\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n   \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kansas\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Tennessee\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Tennessee\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kansas\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nSTRAIGHT-UP\r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Tennessee\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n   \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Tennessee\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Tennessee\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Tennessee\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kansas\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\n            ",

Perhaps the league's best pass combo return -- QB Joe Burrow from injury rehab, WR Ja'Marr Chase from a spitting-related  suspension. Their Cincinnati team is likely cropped out of the playoff picture, but the pair's return and the chance to spoil Thanksgiving night for the Ravens provides motivation. While Baltimore is on a roll, its offense lacks the dynamism of past teams, in no small part because QB Lamar Jackson deals with assorted minor injuries. His rush stats last Sunday -- seven carries, 11 yards -- suggest he is hestant to,  as the announcers say, \"use his legs.\" The Bengals have a habit of heating up down the stretch. They can light the fire big-time here.\n                                    \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Teams on opposite sides of the AFC North standings meet in the nightcap of the 2025 NFL Thanksgiving schedule when the Baltimore Ravens host the Cincinnati Bengals. The Ravens are tied atop the division with the Steelers, and currently hold the tiebreaker. Cincinnati, meanwhile, is tied with the Browns at the bottom of the division, but the Bengals will have receiver Ja'Marr Chase back from suspension and quarterback Joe Burrow (toe) back in the lineup. Kickoff is at 8:20 p.m. ET from Baltimore. Baltimore is a 7-point favorite in the Bengals vs. Ravens odds, while the over/under is 51.5.

Jackson (toe) missed practice on Monday, but was a full participant on Tuesday. They're 3-2 against the spread during that five-game span, but just missed two covers that would've put them on a 5-0 ATS run. Jackson's improved health has certainly been a factor in the run, but the defense is also playing much better. Since an embarrassing 44-10 loss to the Texans on Oct. 5, no team has cleared 20 points against Baltimore. The Bengals are getting healthier, but have ruled out Tee Higgins (concussion) for this one. Burrow being sharp after such a long layoff isn't a foregone conclusions either, so Baltimore has a clear path to a win and cover. See which team to back at SportsLine.New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states:Why the Bengals can coverHaving Burrow back under center certainly makes this a much more competitive matchup. Cincinnati didn't blink against the powerful Patriots in Week 12 either, losing 26-20 and staying within the 7.5-point spread. Now the Bengals get their two-time Pro Bowl quarterback under center, along with Chase back in the lineup following last week's suspension. Baltimore's offense scored just 23 points in each of the past two weeks against two of the league's worst teams -- the Browns and Jets -- giving Cincinnati a chance to keep this game competitive and within the number. See which team to back at SportsLine. Check out the latest BetMGM promo code CBSSPORTS, where new users can get up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses.How to make Ravens vs. Bengals picksFor Bengals vs. Ravens on Thanksgiving, the model is leaning Over the total, projecting 53 combined points.

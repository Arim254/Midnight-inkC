They enter Super Bowl LX with a 16-1 record over their last 17 games, which is not a record that even Seattle can measure up to. New England has incredible balance, ranking second in points scored and fourth in points allowed, with the offense specifically standing out. Drake Maye combines both efficiency with a big-play ability as he leads the league in both completion percentage and yards per pass attempt. Meanwhile, the defense is playing its best entering Super Bowl Sunday as New England has given up one or fewer touchdowns in each of its last five games. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Seahawks can coverIt's hard to find any holes with Seattle, including in regard to the spread, as it has both the most covers and the best cover percentage of the regular plus postseason. The Seahawks are the only NFL team to rank in the top three in both scoring offense and scoring defense, and just five teams had more takeaways in the regular season. Mike Macdonald's crew also boasts top-10 rankings on both the ground and thru the air, but the defense is the star of this team. Seattle leads the NFL in points allowed, third-down defense, yards per rush allowed and yards per pass attempt allowed while ranking second in yards per play given up and rushing touchdowns allowed. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Seahawks vs. Patriots picksSportsLine's model has simulated Patriots vs. Seahawks 10,000 times and is going Under on the total, projecting 44 combined points.

Kelvin Sampson prides himself on having strong defensive teams, so you can bet practices weren't fun for the Houston players the last few days. Texas Tech actually matches up well with the Cougars. TCU does not. Houston should eat the Horned Frogs alive on the offensive glass, while its ball pressure defense causes havoc against a TCU squad that can be sloppy with the basketball. The Cougars are 6-2 away from home this season and I expect them to bounce back with an emphatic win on Tuesday.\" Back Houston at bet365 here:\nUnder 229 in Heat vs. Magic (-110)Miami is in a good position to put up a strong defensive performance on Wednesday night, as it has not played since Sunday.

    "body": "\nFrom NFL player props to Patriots vs. Seahawks (-4.5, 45.5) picks against the spread, your 2026 Super Bowl parlay can go in a number of different directions. Another option is guessing the margin of victory of the game, and there's an NFL betting trend that could help in that regard. Entering Super Bowl LX, three of the last four editions of The Big Game have been decided by exactly 3 points. So, you could back the game's winning margin to be exactly 3 points in a 2026 Super Bowl SGP, which would return +500.Seattle winning by 3 points has +950 NFL prop odds, while New England doing the same carries +1100 odds. But if you want to increase your potential winnings exponentially, then you could string one of these wagers with others into a lucrative Super Bowl same-game parlay. There are countless 2026 Super Bowl picks with plus-money payouts you can target, from alternate lines to anytime TD scorers to exact score predictions. Before making any Super Bowl 60 picks and NFL parlays, you need to see the epic Super Bowl LX same game parlay from SportsLine's proven model that pays out $15,000 on just a $10 bet.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters the 2026 Super Bowl on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now that the simulation model has had a chance to digest the Super Bowl 60 NFL odds, it's locked in its betting picks to form a longshot NFL parlay that could pay out $15,000 for a $10 bettor. You can only see the picks and full parlay by heading to SportsLine.\nTop 2026 Super Bowl parlay picksFor Super Bowl LX, one of the picks featured in the longshot parlay is Patriots WR Kayshon Boutte as an anytime TD scorer (+310). Despite ranking 68th amongst wideouts in catches (33) in the regular season, Boutte was 18th in positional receiving touchdowns (6). He added another score in the Divisional Round and then got a redzone target in the AFC Title Game. While Seattle has an elite defense, through the air is where to exploit that unit. Eight of the last 10 touchdowns the Seahawks have allowed have been via the pass, including all three they gave up in the NFC Title Game.Boutte has more touchdowns this season than the Pats leading receiver, Stefon Diggs, despite the latter having twice as many targets and receptions. The model projects Boutte to score 0.31 touchdowns, which is the highest amongst all Patriots and brings great value to these plus-money odds as one leg of a Super Bowl SGP. See the rest of the picks in the Super Bowl LX same game parlay here, and you can bet Boutte as an anytime TD scorer using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nHow to make NFL parlay picks for a payout of $15,000The parlay also includes three additional Super Bowl picks from SportsLine's NFL model, including a must-see first NFL touchdown-scorer prop that pays out 25-1.

New York travels to Toronto for the second half of a back-to-back after its home victory Tuesday behind 28 points by Jalen Brunson. The 29-year-old standout guard is seventh in the league in scoring at 28 ppg, and he scored 31 points against the 76ers in Philadelphia on Saturday.

    "body": "\n        In one of the most incredible and exciting endings you'll ever see in the UEFA Champions League, Benfica managed to qualify for the playoffs thanks to a last-minute goal scored by goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin against Real Madrid. The side coached by Portuguese manager Jose Mourinho qualified in the last minute thanks to a 4-2 victory against the Spanish giants that also ended up with nine players after both Raul Asencio and Rodrygo were sent off in the final minutes of the match. Benfica will now face either Inter or Real Madrid next month in the playoffs, both clubs having previously been managed by Mourinho.Trubin became the fifth different goalkeeper to score a UEFA Champions League goal, after Jorg Butt (three goals scored), Sinan Bolat, Vincent Enyeama, and Ivan Provedel. Coming up for a late free kick, the goalkeeper headed home with absolute precision. Here it is:\nThe match was simply incredible with the guests opening the score with Kylian Mbappe in the first half before two goals scored by the home side with Andreas Schjelderup and the penalty converted by Vangelis Pavlidis before the end of the first half.During the second 45 minutes, Schjelderup scored the third goal for Benfica before Mbappe's second goal of the night in Lisbon. It looked like it was over for Mourinho's side, as the 3–2 scoreline wasn't enough to reach the playoffs with Olympique Marseille level on goal difference. \nHowever, a stunning late winner from their goalkeeper turned everything around, sending Benfica into the playoffs. There, they will face either Inter or Real Madrid, with Alvaro Arbeloa's side finishing ninth in the standings, just outside the top eight, and forced into the playoff round ahead of the knockout stages.\n\"When I made the last changes, [Franjo] Ivanovic and Antonio Silva, I was told [that] is enough, so let's close the door. When I made the changes a few seconds later, they tell me we need one more goal, but I cannot make more changes, so that was the lucky point to get a free kick that allows us to go there with the big guy,\" Mourinho said after the game. What a night under the lights in Europe.Napoli out of the tournament\nElsewhere, Antonio Conte's Napoli are out of the Champions League. The 2024-25 Serie A champions lost 3-2 at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona against Chelsea and are now eliminated from the tournament. The Azzurri conceded the opening goal to Chelsea, a penalty converted by Enzo Fernandez, before scoring two goals in the first half with Antonio Vergara and Rasmus Hojlund. However, things became more challenging in the second half, when Joao Pedro's brace cost Napoli their qualification for the playoffs. After losing 3-0 to Juventus last weekend, this was another major setback for Napoli's ambitions this season as the Azzurri are now nine points behind Inter in the Serie A standings after winning the Scudetto last campaign in the first season of Conte at the new club. \nThe biggest disappointment \nWhile Napoli's situation was already difficult ahead of the last matchday of the league phase, as they entered the last game with a minus-five goal difference, there were different expectations on Roberto De Zerbi's Olympique Marseille that lost 3-0 away against Club Brugge, losing their spot to qualify for the playoffs. Despite the disappointing result and thanks to what was happening around Europe, De Zerbi's side only lost their spot with the goal scored by Benfica's goalkeeper in the last minute of the game against Real Madrid, showing that this team was probably not expecting such result in the last minutes even when their game was already over. For the Italian manager and Marseille, this was a \"night to forget\" according to the club sport director Medhi Benatia. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        LONDON -- A slice of history for Arsenal, an etching into the history books for this particular era of the European Cup. Twelve teams had gone unbeaten in the group stage before, none yet when there were eight games to play before the knockout round. Does that mean anything at all? Ask again in 15 years.After all, if Arne Slot had really wanted to, he could probably have got eight wins from eight last season. Instead he did what any coach would have done in his position and shuffled the pack secure in the knowledge that a top seeding position was in the bag. Mikel Arteta did much the same tonight, it's just that he can rotate his Arsenal side while still rolling out Viktor Gyokeres, Eberechi Eze and a returning Kai Havertz. That was always going to be more than enough to brush aside bottom side Kairat.Havertz's return came with a goal and assist in the first 15 minutes of a game that in pure footballing terms amounted to little more than one of Europe's best sides playing with their food. Riccardo Calafiori spotting Kairat a penalty, elegantly dispatched by Jorginho (no, not that one), at least gave the packed away end something to celebrate. They got to end their campaign in dream fashion too. Ricardinho, every inch the sort of player you'd expect if I told you he was a Brazilian wearing the No.99 shirt in a fringe European league capping the game with Kairar's second in the 94th minute. The sight of the delighted visitors massed in front of their brilliant, ebuliant away end was one of the treats of the Champions League so far.Victory was rarely in doubt for Arsenal but the nature of this win was hardly the sort to have supporters rushing to book their cabin. Really, there's probably not a lot to this beyond Arsenal not really converting enough of their four-plus expected goals, turning 60 penalty box touches into three goals while Kairat turned their four into two. It would be unwise to read too much into the struggles of the second half, if there is any time when being lackadaisical is understandable it's when you're two goals up, clearly a lock for top spot. This was, after all, the only dead rubber of the Champions League's 18 Matchday 8 games.\nHaving said that, Gyokeres toiled in a fashion, scoring one smartly early on and providing a ferocious off ball screen for Havertz's goal, his time in north London so far perhaps typified when Gabriel Martinelli stole in on the goal line to deny him what might have been a second. It's rarely an egregiously bad day when a player gets over two non-penalty xG, even if he only scores one, but this was one of many facets of the game that should have come with the caveat \"be careful when merging Champions League and Premier League data\". \n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            So what was the point of being at the Emirates Stadium on one of those all hands on the desk nights? Well perhaps what we've witnessed here is a particular form of history that should at least place Arsenal in a fairly elite club. In the old days of six team groups between 1993 and 2023, 13 teams managed to go six from six, only two of whom would then go on to win the whole thing. Even if you set aside the very obvious two more games thing, logic would dictate that it should be quite a bit harder to get eight from eight than six from six.Assume that most of those teams to have gone 100% through the old group stages were Pot One teams and the league phase has become that bit more difficult for the best of the best, who must now play two of their top seeded counterparts. To get to perfection in the league phase, Arsenal had to overcome Bayern Munich, potentially their closest rivals to win the tournament come the end of the season, Inter and Atletico Madrid. Compare that to the last team to go 6-0-0; Manchester City had to get past a then-faltering RB Leipzig, Young Boys and Red Star. Even the kindest draw in the league phase throws up a lot more challenges than that.\nTwo years into this competition, where so many teams have so much to play for right the way to the death, you feel like a perfect record will be a rare achievement. There will be too many occasions like last year where the team on seven from seven have nothing to play for and PSV Eindhoven have a play off spot to wrap up or a top eight berth to compete for. For now all we can really go on are vibes and guesstimates.Whether it's an historic achievement or not is something we can circle back to a decade or so hence. In the meantime it's clearly something for Arsenal to take pride in. \"I'm very proud of all the players and the run that we had in this first stage of the competition,\" said Mikel Arteta. \"It's very difficult to win eight games in a row in the Champions League, and you can see what happened with all the teams, so we really need to acknowledge that.\"At the end that shows that we can consistently perform at this level and if it's the first time it means how difficult it is to do it, so the players need to acknowledge that and feel even more conviction about what we're able to do.\"\nWhat it doesn't mean is much for a team with Arsenal's aspirations. It's rather like the 2015-16 Golden State Warriors, a comparison that Areta was downright baffled by in his post match press conference. Still 8-0-0 scans better onto 73-9 than he might have realised. Both don't mean a thing without a ring.The record of Spartak Moscow's 1995-96 side and the Paris Saint-Germain outfit of a year earlier would be too obscure for all but the most obtuse of pub quizzes. Given that only Bayern Munich in 2019-20 and Real Madrid in 2023-24 went on to win the Champions League after sweeping their group, it's hard to make the case that such an achievement tells you much beyond the quality of those teams in the early season. No wonder Arteta was keen to brush the record aside.\"That's it, now the competition stops, we have a period of reflection as to what we've done, we're going to start to prepare when we know our next opponent, what is next, and that's it.\" \nWinning their eight league games makes Arsenal a curio. Winning the title gives a historical sheen to what they've achieved in the league phase.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The matchup is set. It'll be the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots duking it out for the right to lift the Lombardi Trophy and call themselves Super Bowl LX champions. These clubs find themselves en route to Santa Clara for the big game after eking out wins on Championship Sunday, albeit in different fashions. Seattle had to throw its way to a Super Bowl appearance as Sam Darnold threw for 346 yards and three touchdowns in a 31-27 victory over the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC Championship. Meanwhile, New England churned out a 10-7 win during a snowy AFC Championship against the Denver Broncos at Mile High. The Patriots leaned on defense and Drake Maye's rushing ability to punch their ticket. While these are widely different versions of these clubs, this is a rematch of Super Bowl XLIX back during the 2014 season. That game is remembered most for Malcolm Butler's infamous goal-line interception to give Tom Brady and the Patriots their then-fourth Super Bowl title in franchise history, and spoil Russell Wilson and the Seahawks bid at back-to-back championships. \n        \n            \n                2026 Super Bowl SGP, props, Seahawks vs. Patriots same-game parlay: Get an epic $15,000 return on a $10 bet\n                \n                    Ross Kelly                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThat's the history. But what does the future have in store for us in this upcoming Super Bowl? What do the oddsmakers think of this matchup?

Mike Vrabel's team was also 7-2 ATS in those nine road matchups. As for Seattle, they did not go undefeated on the road like the Patriots, but were an equally impressive 8-1 on the road. They also come into this Super Bowl with an NFL-best 8-1 ATS road record. \nPlayerSuper Bowl MVP oddsSam Darnold+130Drake Maye+235Jaxon Smith-Njigba+550Kenneth Walker III+600Rhamondre Stevenson+2500Rashid Shaheed+2800Marcus Jones+5500Stefon Diggs+6000Naturally, both quarterbacks are going to be No. 1 and No. 2 in the odds to win Super Bowl MVP. With the Seahawks favored, it makes sense to see Darnold as the odds-on favorite for the award. Seven of the last 10 Super Bowl MVPs were quarterbacks. Two of the remaining three were wide receivers (Cooper Kupp in Super Bowl LVI and Julian Edelman in Super Bowl LIII), while Von Miller (Super Bowl 50) was the other non-QB MVP and lone defensive player to earn the distinction over the last decade. \nInterestingly, both Kenneth Walker III and Rhamondre Stevenson have favorable odds out of the gate. If either of them is named Super Bowl MVP, they'd become the first running back to earn the award since Terrell Davis after Super Bowl XXXII. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The latest on Giannis Antetokounmpo: The man who will never ask the Milwaukee Bucks for a trade is \"ready for a new home\" and \"has informed the Bucks for months that he believes the moment has come to part ways,\" per ESPN's Shams Charania. Several teams have reportedly made \"aggressive\" offers for Antetokounmpo, and Milwaukee is \"starting to listen.\"Discussions with the New York Knicks last August reportedly went nowhere, but the Knicks are among Antetokounmpo's suitors leading up to the Feb. 5 trade deadline, per SNY's Ian Begley. So here's a question: Can they actually get him?What do the Bucks want?The Bucks are looking for \"blue-chip young talent and/or a surplus of draft picks\" in exchange for their franchise player, and they're willing to reassess the situation in the offseason if the offers aren't to their liking, per ESPN. Antetokounmpo is currently sidelined with a right calf strain, and Milwaukee is 18-27, the seventh-worst record in the league. In theory, the Bucks could wait to see how the lottery shakes out -- they will receive the less favorable of the New Orleans Pelicans' and its own picks -- and try to sell Antetokounmpo on playing with whomever they can acquire on draft night, at which point they will be able to trade three first-round picks. Waiting would give prospective Antetokounmpo suitors more flexibility, too.The Bucks don't control their own first-round draft pick until 2031. This season, they've been outscored by 11.4 points per 100 possessions without Antetokounmpo on the floor in non-garbage-time minutes. This iteration of the team has no future. The point of trading him is to give the team a future.\n\n        \n            \n                Giannis Antetokounmpo next team odds: Bucks forward looking for new destination, Heat and Knicks lurking\n                \n                    Chinmay Vaidya                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nCan the Knicks offer them that?In a two-team trade, no. The Knicks' stars aren't young, their young players aren't blue chips and, as a result of the moves they made in the 2024 offseason -- they sent five first-round picks and a pick swap to the Brooklyn Nets in the Mikal Bridges deal and included a first-round pick in the Karl-Anthony Towns deal -- they can't offer Milwaukee any future picks right now.If New York wants to trade for Antetokounmpo before the deadline, it would almost certainly have to put together a multi-team trade, in which it sends some of its most valuable players elsewhere and the Bucks come away with the young talent and draft capital they're looking for. That is easier said than done.In theory, it is mechanically simple for the Knicks to acquire Antetokounmpo. They just need to match or exceed his $54.1 million salary. By himself, Towns gets them most of the way there, as he makes $53.1 million. Alternatively, they could aggregate smaller salaries: OG Anunoby is making $39.6 million this season, Bridges $24.9 million, Josh Hart $19.5 million, Mitchell Robinson $13 million.\nIn reality, it is a lot more complicated. Towns is an All-Star-caliber player, but his contract, which includes a $61 million player option in 2027-28, likely does not have positive value on the trade market. Bridges (trade eligible as of Feb. 1) and Anunoby are more tradable, but, assuming Jalen Brunson is off the table, it's not clear that any combination of Knicks players could return the sort of stuff that Milwaukee wants.One example: The Ringer's Zach Lowe made note of a rumor about the Portland Trail Blazers facilitating an Antetokounmpo-to-NY deal. In one hypothetical trade construction, the Knicks would get Jrue Holiday, who won a title with Antetokounmpo, and the Bucks would get some of their own draft capital back from Portland. There is logic in all of that, but it falls apart when it comes to the Blazers' side of the story -- they'd be getting Towns and his enormous contract.  It's hard to imagine them relinquishing those (extremely valuable) draft assets in such a deal. I tried to construct a fake trade involving those three teams without including Towns, and I'm not sure any of the front offices would be happy with the end result, which landed Antetokounmpo and Holiday in New York but sent both Bridges and Anunoby to Portland and Hart (plus Jerami Grant, Guerschon Yabusele and, of course, draft capital) to Milwaukee.\nWhat if the Knicks wait until the offseason?On draft night, New York will have more to offer, as it could offer its 2026 first-round pick and 2033 first-round pick to Milwaukee. The 2033 pick has real value; at that point, Brunson will be almost 37 and Antetokounmpo will be less than six months from his 39th birthday. This alone makes a potential Antetokounmpo-Knicks trade much simpler in the offseason ... as long they don't mind being hard-capped at the second apron again next year. (This is an automatic consequence of aggregating salaries in a trade.)The Cleveland Cavaliers are the only second-apron team in the NBA right now. Most teams have little interest in joining them, but, after an Antetokounmpo trade, the Knicks could be the exception, especially if they sacrifice depth in the deal. They'd be as all-in as a team can possibly be, and they'd want to avoid, say, losing Robinson for nothing in free agency.Two more issues with waiting for the offseason: Other potential suitors (including the Miami Heat) will also be able to include more draft capital in their offers, and the Bucks might have already traded him elsewhere by then.\nIt is no secret that, at least for some time last summer, Antetokounmpo had interest in playing in New York. If he makes that preference clear, and if the Knicks are willing to put just about everything that they can on the table, maybe there's a deal to be done. They're not particularly equipped to win a bidding war now, though, and there's no guarantee that they'll have a better shot at landing him in a few months.\n            ",

Both the North Course and the South Course will welcome golfers to Torrey Pines for the 2026 Farmers Insurance Open, where 10 of the top 20 players in the Official World Golf Rankings will compete for the third title of the young season.Not included among those names inside the top 20 is perhaps the biggest of all this week: Brooks Koepka. Making his first start on the PGA Tour since the 2022 WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play, the 35-year-old returns to the league following four seasons with LIV Golf.Able to return to the PGA Tour through the newly created Returning Member Program, Koepka is required to play a full PGA Tour schedule while also being on the outside looking in when it comes to signature events. As such, the five-time major champion will become a fixture in these full-field tournaments; he is not only making his PGA Tour return this week at Torrey Pines, he has already committed to next week's WM Phoenix Open and the Cognizant Classic. Koepka's inclusion in the field also means two additional spots were added to round out threesomes.While Koepka looks to ease back into a normal playing schedule, players like Xander Schauffele and Cameron Young will also be making their season debuts. The two went in opposite directions in 2025 as Schauffele missed being included in the Tour Championship field for the first time in his career, and Young nabbed his first career victory at the Wyndham Championship.\nBoth players starred for the U.S. team at the Ryder Cup and will look to roll their momentum into the new year alongside the likes of reigning champion Harris English, U.S. Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley and teammate J.J. Spaun, plus Europeans such as Justin Rose and Ludvig Åberg and Sony Open winner Chris Gotterup.2026 Farmers Insurance Open scheduleDates: Jan. 29 - Feb. 1Location: Torrey Pines Golf Course (South Course) — San Diego, CaliforniaPar: 72 | Yardage: 7,765 | Architect: William BellPurse: $9,600,0002026 Farmers Insurance Open field, oddsOdds via DraftKings Sportsbook\nXander Schauffele (15-1)Ludvig Åberg (17-1): The young Swede acquitted himself nicely at Torrey Pines last season as he led the Farmers Insurance Open for most of the tournament before becoming ill over the weekend. He exacted revenge a couple of weeks later by winning the Genesis Invitational on the same golf course. Åberg was forced to withdraw from the American Express last week due to illness, but he appears up to the challenge to return to competition at a golf course where he knows his game will translate.Cameron Young: (18-1): Many expect a big season from Young, but outside of a run at the Genesis Invitational a handful of seasons back, the West Coast Swing has never been too kind to him. He comes into this year as a PGA Tour winner, a Ryder Cup darling and off the best putting season of his career. Young is back to hitting his comfortable shot shape and has the power to play well at Torrey Pines, which features some of the thickest rough and thinnest fairways players face all season.Patrick Cantlay (23-1)Si Woo Kim (24-1): Kim may be the best ball striker in the world among players not named Scottie Scheffler. The 54-hole leader at the American Express, the four-time PGA Tour winner fell flat in the middle of his round and was ultimately upended by the world No. 1. Still, the result counted for his second straight quality outing to open up his campaign, and he seeks to move his game to a bigger, brawnier test that is Torrey Pines. He has two top 25 finishes in his last three appearances but has not finished inside the top 10 in eight career starts.J.J. Spaun (25-1)Chris Gotterup (29-1): He continues to show that, when the wind starts blowing, and a hair of creativity and shot shaping are required, he can stand tall. Gotterup claimed the third win of his PGA Tour career in as many seasons at the Sony Open, and he should be licking his lips at trying his hand at Torrey Pines, where he finished inside the top 25 during his lone prior trip. In possession of plenty of power and finesse, the right-hander has the goods to keep the momentum rolling on the mainland.Hideki Matsuyama (29-1): He has made nine straight cuts at Torrey Pines and arrives off a T13 at the Sony Open where he sizzled with his iron play and struggled with his putter -- Matsuyama's typical game. Putting from inside 15 feet and inside 5 feet are among the most difficult on the PGA Tour this week, so that could level the playing field ever so slightly and play into his hands. His iron play remains elite, and scramblers have fared well at this tournament, which is another feather in Matsuyama's cap.Maverick McNealy (31-1)Jason Day (31-1)Harris English (31-1)2026 Farmers Insurance Open picks\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Xander Schauffele\n                    \n            \n            \n        \nWinner (15-1): The fall was huge for someone like Schauffele as he was among the bright spots for the U.S. Ryder Cup team and claimed the Baycurrent Classic in Japan. He missed this tournament last season due to injury, so he will be champing at the bit to return to a comfortable golf course where the San Diego native has played hundreds of rounds. While his falloff in 2025 was noticeable, Schauffele struggled primarily on the greens after consistently being one of the best putters on the PGA Tour. He will return to that level of competence this year starting this week.\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Ryan Gerard\n                    \n            \n            \n        \nContender (45-1): If he keeps knocking on the door like this, it is bound to fall over. In two starts in 2026, Gerard has finished behind only Gotterup and Scheffler, the first two winners of the season. He continues to show his proficiency from tee to green, especially with his iron play, as he putter continues to play catch-up. Gerard's game may be tailored more to the difficult tests on the PGA Tour schedule, like Torrey Pines, where he finished T15 in his lone appearance.\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Sahith Theegala\n                    \n            \n            \n        \nSleeper (90-1): It has been a long year or so for Theegala, but he is now finally healthy and looking the part. The lovable right-hander notched a top 10 finish at the American Express -- his first since the 2024 Procore Championship -- and has made all four cuts in his Farmers Insurance Open career. The putter has carried most of the weight through two starts this season, but the driver is coming around in a way that should provide optimism for those in his camp.Who will win the 2026 Farmers Insurance Open, and which longshots will stun the golfing world? Visit SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard, all from the model that's nailed 16 golf majors heading into the weekend, and find out. \n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                                            ",

    "body": "\n        Wing players often live in the fantasy gray area — not quite stars, not quite streamers — yet many quietly deliver across multiple categories night after night. While the spotlight usually shines on high-usage guards and dominant bigs, dependable wings can be the glue that holds a roster together, providing scoring, defensive stats, and efficient minutes without much fanfare. In this article, we highlight 10 wings who are getting the job done without the hype, whether through expanded roles, career-best efficiency, or steady two-way production. If you're searching for undervalued contributors who can stabilize your fantasy lineup, these names deserve a closer look.Saddiq Bey, PelicansAfter being sidelined through the entirety of last season, Bey has been a welcome addition to the Pelicans' lineup, working his way into a starting role after the first couple of weeks of action. He is averaging 15.9 points, 5.8 rebounds, 2.4 assists, and a career-high one steal per game. He also reached the 20-point mark 13 times, including a season high of 36 points, and he has six double-doubles with points and rebounds. Although his 44.5 percent shooting from the field represents a career high, there remains room for improvement in that department. Jaden McDaniels, TimberwolvesMcDaniels has been a steady factor in a solid start to the season for the Timberwolves, averaging career highs of 14.8 points, 2.9 assists, and one block, to go with 4.5 rebounds and 1.1 steals per game. He is also shooting an impressive 50.8 percent from the field, including 42.3 percent from deep. He has topped the 20-point mark on 10 occasions, including a season high of 30. His ability to shine on both ends of the court makes him an ideal fit in just about any lineup, and he should continue to prosper by filling in the gaps among a highly talented starting five. Kelly Oubre Jr., 76ersOubre is averaging 17.2 points, 3.7 rebounds, two assists, and 1.5 steals over six straight starts, having played in 12 games since returning from a nearly seven-week absence. His presence on the wing is a major boost for his squad, as he brings agile defending and is delivering a career-best 49.4 percent shooting on the offensive end. He poses a notable threat from long range, where he is converting a career-best 36.8 percent. He also does well to ensure that he continues to earn big minutes by bringing intensity and energy to the floor, helping win 50/50 plays and driving momentum. \nBrice Sensabaugh, JazzAfter an eight-game stint as a starter, Sensabaugh has been back in a bench role for the last couple of weeks, averaging 20 points, 3.4 rebounds, and 1.4 assists over that stretch, including a season-high 43-point effort on January 14. He is averaging a career-high 11.8 points in 21 minutes per game on the season, as he did not see as much action through the first month of play.  At 22-years-old in his third season, he is showing that he can step in as a well-rounded and fearsome threat from the wing. Ideally, he will continue to see a good amount of playing time to expand on his game, as the Jazz potentially look to slow down the usage of their other top players going into the second half of the season. Jake LaRavia, LakersPlaying alongside LeBron James, Luka Doncic, and Austin Reaves, it is no surprise that LaRavia's contributions may fly under the radar. However, the fourth-year forward provides a well-rounded and reliable effort in his role, averaging 9.5 points and two assists, along with career highs of 4.3 rebounds and 1.4 steals in a career-high 27.4 minutes per game. He is also shooting 46.4 percent from the field, including 34.8 percent from deep, and he has topped the 20-point mark on four occasions. Although he is currently limited to a bench role, he continues to show that he is on the rise as a formidable talent. Naji Marshall, MavericksMarshall is on a roll, averaging 20 points, 5.9 rebounds, 4.5 assists, and 1.4 steals over 10 consecutive starts and has helped a significantly shorthanded Mavs squad scrap their way to 19 wins, good enough for 11th place in the West. He is averaging career highs of 14.7 points on 54.5 percent shooting in 29.2 minutes per game, and he has racked up at least five assists on eight occasions. Marshall is certainly making the most of the opportunity to prove that he is capable of producing very competitive numbers across the board and, as a result, will likely continue to build his profile as an upper-tier two-way contributor. \nPeyton Watson, NuggetsWhile his team has been decimated by injury trouble, Watson has taken the opportunity to show off a new level to his game, as he is averaging 1.2 blocks, along with career highs of 14.4 points, five rebounds, 1.9 assists, and one steal in 30.1 minutes per game. He is also shooting 49.9 percent from the field, including a blistering 41.1 percent from deep, and has reached the 20-point mark in 13 outings, with a season high of 35. He had done a solid job in his limited role through past seasons, but his recent breakout will likely result in a permanent boost to his profile, as well as a continued increase in responsibility. RJ Barrett, RaptorsBarrett's contribution may be easily overshadowed by teammates Scottie Barnes and Brandon Ingram, but his skillset remains critical in his team's success, as evidenced by some of their struggles when he was sidelined for most of December. He is averaging 19 points, 5.1 rebounds, 3.6 assists, and 0.8 steals per game and has reached the 20-point mark 12 times in 25 appearances. He does a great job of helping balance the floor and facilitate a healthy offense by acting as a long-range threat and player who can create off the dribble. However, he does not stand out as a notable defensive stopper. Julian Champagnie, SpursChampagnie has done an incredible job carving out a role for himself amidst a Spurs roster with plenty of competition for playing time at the wing positions. His 3-point shooting has been the driver of his success, as he averaged 2.2 made 3s last season and has upped that to 2.5 made 3s on 37.4 percent shooting from deep this season. He is averaging career highs of 11.7 points, 6.2 rebounds, 1.5 assists, and 0.9 steals in 28.7 minutes per game and should continue to stand as a go-to rotation piece for his up-and-coming squad. \nDillon Brooks, SunsBrooks is having perhaps the best year of his career since joining the Suns, as he is averaging a career-high 20.5 points per game on 44 percent shooting, including 34.6 percent from deep. His energy and intensity on the court are major components in the value he brings to his team, as it is clear that he lifts the competitive level of those around him. He averages 1.1 steals per game and often takes on the toughest defensive matchups, making his overall impact invaluable, ensuring that he continues to earn top-tier playing time.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Princeton has been quietly taking care of business and climbing up the rankings, so it's about time to ask how far this team can really go. The Tigers are currently riding a 15-game winning streak, which is the third-longest active streak in women's basketball. This has helped Princeton move up to No. 19 in the AP Top 25, the Tigers' best ranking since being No. 13 in 2015.\"Our goals have remained our goals,\" coach Carla Berube told CBS Sports. \"And that's to be Ivy League champs, regular season and to be in the NCAA tournament and get some great games, hopefully. We've been successful in the past. The last couple of years we've lost in the first round and we are looking forward to more.\"It's still only January, but this week CBS Sports bracketologist Connor Groel has Princeton as a No. 6 seed, and the team was projected to be a No. 5 seed just last week. No Ivy League team has ever made it past the second round of the women's tournament, but could this be the year? Let's take a closer look at why Princeton has been gaining recognition.BackgroundPrinceton has reached the second round of the NCAA Tournament three times: 2015, 2022 and 2023. In 2015, the Tigers entered the Big Dance with a perfect 31-0 record but ultimately fell 85-70 to Maryland.\nLast year, three Ivy League teams made it into the NCAA tournament for the first time in league history, but only Columbia managed to win a game, a 63-60 victory over Washington in the First Four. None of the teams made it past the first round. The Tigers suffered a 68-65 loss to Iowa State in the First Four, but that close loss showed the potential of this program.This season tipped off with a win against Georgia Tech, a team that managed to upset Notre Dame in early January. Princeton's schedule hasn't had too many ranked teams, but the Tigers' only loss so far came at the hands of then-No. 9 Maryland on Nov. 16. The final score was 84-68, but the Tigers had a particularly impressive showing in the second quarter when they outscored the Terrapins 20-8, forced eight turnovers and made Maryland pay in transition. It was still a loss, but it was early in the season and that kind of experience could help the team later on.Madison St. Rose's comebackThe current roster has all five starters averaging double figures, which instantly makes it harder for opponents to know who the defense needs to focus on. The team is led by senior Madison St. Rose's 16.5 points per game. The 2023 Ivy League Rookie of the Year only played four games last season before tearing her ACL, but her return gives the team some invaluable leadership on the court and also in the locker room with her work ethic.\nThe Ivy League doesn't have official summer workouts, but St. Rose worked hard to make a comeback and spent every day of the offseason with the team trainer and conditioning coach. \"It just goes to show what kind of drive and work ethic she has,\" Berube said. \"And also just passion. She loves this game so much. It was really hard for her to just sit and watch last year. There was nothing more she wanted to do than get out there and play with her best friends.\"\nPrinceton has multiple optionsThe other four starters are juniors Fadima Tall, Skye Belker, Ashley Chea and Olivia Hutcherson. Berube describes St. Rose as a true three-level scorer, but also added that everyone brings different skills that are key for the team's success.\n\"I think what is good is that they compliment each other well,\" she said. \"They are not the same kind of players at all. The way Olivia Hutcherson scores is a very different way than Fadima Tall scores. Olivia gets a lot of offensive rebounds, putbacks or scores in transition really well. Whereas Fadima, she can shoot 3s but also can score on the block. Ashley Chea is scoring at the rim or 3s. Skye Belker is pull-up jumpers and midrange. She can also shoot the 3 well too.\"Hutcherson has probably made the biggest jump from her sophomore season as she went from scoring 4.2 points per game to 11.4 points per contest. She can also brag about winning the team's recent \"dip off\" at Burebe's house with an Artichoke dip she and Sarah Lessig made from scratch.\nMeanwhile, Chea is the kind of player who likes to have the ball in her hands when the team is under pressure. In the 82-79 overtime win against Harvard earlier this month, she hit the game-tying three-pointer with 0.4 seconds remaining in regulation.\n\"Ashley Chea, she's made for those moments,\" Berube said. \"She's done it several times for us. She just has ice in her veins and loves those moments.\"\nDon't sleep on Toby NwekeThe starters have been solid, but Berube said her bench is also impactful. She highlighted Toby Nweke as one of the most underrated players on her team.The 5-foot-8 sophomore guard is averaging 6.2 points, 3.5 rebounds and 1.3 steals per game. These stats don't exactly stand out on the stat sheet, but the coach talked about the impact she makes when she checks in.\n\"I think she just makes a great impact every time she steps on the floor,\" Berube said. \"She is a great defender. She is long, she is quick, but she also can knock down the 3. She is like our best corner 3-point shooter. I just think she makes a great impact. Not a lot is talked about her, but I think she makes us better every single day.\"\nThe outlook for MarchSo, what does this all mean for the Tigers' postseason hopes? The No. 8 seed that Princeton earned in the 2015 NCAA Tournament is still the highest seed in Ivy history, so even the current projected No. 6 seed would be a significant achievement. As Groel pointed out in his Jan. 20 bracketology, Princeton could lose a game or two down the stretch and still end up with a single-digit seed.But in women's hoops, the top four seeds in each bracket get to host first-round games, meaning if Princeton wants to be the first Ivy in the Sweet 16, a No. 4 seed would certainly help the Tigers, currently 40 in the NET rankings, have an easier path. However, this would be a very difficult feat to achieve.\nRemaining undefeated in conference play would be a must, and the team likely also needs to win the Ivy League tournament. The game against Columbia on Friday is a particularly important one because the Lions are the second highest Ivy League team in the NET rankings at 59, as is the rematch on the road against Columbia on Feb. 13. Even all of that might not be enough because the Tigers are done with non-conference games, so it will be hard for them to get a win big enough to really boost their resume. For them to continue moving up the rankings, they might need teams ranked higher than them not only to tumble, but to fail to rack up more Quad 1 and Quad 2 wins, something those teams will have more opportunities to notch given they play in tougher conferences.Of course, a top-four seed is not a requirement to make it to the Sweet 16 -- March is famous for its upsets, and Princeton has the type of veteran team that has been known to cause some madness.Regardless, Princeton has already established itself as one of the top mid-major programs in the country and it will be fun to see what else the Tigers can achieve this season.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Eli Manning will have to wait at least one more year. The two-time Super Bowl MVP reportedly did not receive enough votes for election into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in his second year of eligibility. His snub last year did not come as a complete surprise, after all, he had a .500 record in his career and rarely was near the top of the annual passing leaderboards. On the other hand, his two Super Bowl MVPs with game-winning drives over the Patriots and Tom Brady are the stuff of legend and something you figure Canton can't live without. It's what makes up one of the most complex Hall of Fame cases ever.Why Manning was snubbed againHall of Fame quarterbacks are naturally a very elite group. These are quarterbacks with a lot of hardware who were consistently among the best quarterbacks in the game. For the most part, Manning fell well below the bar of being one of the best passers on a year in, year out basis. I looked at Manning's yearly ranks among qualified quarterbacks in a variety of stats. The comparisons range from unflattering to shocking. \nHe is nowhere close to a Hall of Fame caliber quarterback when it comes to efficiency measures. \n        \n            \n                Bill Belichick snub: Pro Football Hall of Fame issues statement, vows 'action' if voters violated bylaws\n                \n                    Bryan DeArdo                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nFirst, I looked at EPA per play (expected points added per play). He ranked 18th on average when ranking every season of his 16-year career. That's below average play! It's worse than Derek Carr. Manning finished in the top 10 three times and none in the top five. Next up, Pro Football Reference's ANY/A+ (adjusted net yards per pass attempt index). It's a mouthful, but essentially a better version of passer rating that is era adjusted, perfect for comparing Manning to both his peers and quarterbacks in the Hall of Fame. His average annual rank was 17th, or worse than Andy Dalton. The average Hall of Fame QB ranked 10th on an annual basis. \nThere's also passer rating for the dinosaurs out there! His average rank was 19th. Worse than Carson Wentz. Ouch. He had zero top-five finishes and just one top-10 finish, in 2011. The average Hall of Fame QB (I looked at 14 to debut since 1969) ranked 10th on an annual basis. None had fewer than five top-10 finishes in their career. In other words, Manning never sniffed consistent greatness in terms of efficiency and that's very far below the bar for a HOFer.HOF QBs who debuted since 1969 - Top 10 passer rating finishes:Peyton Manning: 15Joe Montana: 13Dan Marino: 12Brett Favre: 11Steve Young: 8Dan Fouts: 8Roger Staubach: 7Kurt Warner: 6Terry Bradshaw: 6Jim Kelly: 6Troy Aikman: 6Warren Moon: 6Ken Stabler: 5John Elway: 5He ranked around 10th for the year-by-year leaderboards for touchdown passes and passing yards, which is closer to the Hall of Fame average.The table below summarizes the average year-by-year ranks for Manning vs. the 14 Hall of Fame QBs to debut since 1969. It's not pretty. \nEli Manning Avg Season QB Ranks in 16-Year CareerAvg RankHOF QB AvgWorse ThanTop 10 FinishesTop 5 FinishesEPA/Play18thN/ADerek Carr30ANY/A+17th10thAndy Dalton21Passer rating19th10thCarson Wentz10Pass TD11th9thAaron Brooks72Pass yards10th9thTrent Green73The longer it takes Eli to get in the tougher it could be with other quarterbacks coming on the ballot soon. Drew Brees is a lock for this year (even if Bill Belichick wasn't a first ballot Hall of Famer). Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers and Ben Roethlisberger will also be locks. His resume is going to be compared with a group of borderline Hall of Fame quarterbacks that will be tough to judge in this passing era where everyone put up big volume numbers like Manning. Leaving Cam Newton off this comparison because his Hall of Fame resume comes down to his rushing numbers.Notable 2000s Quarterbacks on the Hall of Fame BubbleMVPTitlesPass TDPass YardsMatthew Stafford0142364,516Philip Rivers0042563,984Eli Manning0236657,023Russell Wilson0135346,966Matt Ryan1038162,792Here's a look at where each of these Hall of Fame bubble quarterbacks ranked on a yearly basis for passer rating, passing yards and passing touchdowns.

He was the passer on perhaps the craziest play in Super Bowl history (David Tyree's helmet catch) and the best throw in Super Bowl history (sideline dime to Mario Manningham). He's one of four quarterbacks with multiple game-winning drives in the Super Bowl including Tom Brady, Patrick Mahomes and Terry Bradshaw.Manning was also an ironman. He started 210 straight regular-season games, the third-longest streak by a quarterback all-time behind Brett Favre and Philip Rivers. He also retired top 10 all-time in pass touchdowns and passing yards. That will carry less weight since he played in a passing era and he will continue to be pushed further outside the top 10.So what should happen?I'm glad I don't have to make this decision. He's a slam dunk Hall of Famer in some respects and not even close in others. Stats be damned, though. It's cliche, but you can't tell the story of the NFL without Manning. He may have only had two great playoff runs but they are enough to carry him to football immortality. Also, standing in and delivering pass after pass for 210 straight starts is a Hall of Fame worthy accomplishment. Manning won't completely break the Hall of Fame mold either. Joe Namath is the last quarterback inducted with a a losing record. His average rank in passer rating was 17th (Eli was 19th). His average rank in passing touchdowns was 12th (Eli was 11th) and he was ninth in pass  yards (Eli was 10th in average rank). He rode into the Hall of Fame off \"the guarantee\", the largest upset in Super Bowl history. I don't see why Eli wouldn't eventually get in with a very similar resume and two infamous Super Bowl moments to his name. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Bill Belichick won't be the only snub for the Pro Football Hall of Fame's class of 2026. News broke Tuesday that Belichick -- despite winning eight Super Bowls, including six as coach of the New England Patriots -- did not receive enough votes to receive induction into the Hall of Fame during his first year of eligibility. Eli Manning, the quarterback that defeated Belichick's Patriots in two Super Bowls, reportedly isn't getting inducted this summer, either. Manning, who quarterbacked the New York Giants from 2004-19, did not receive enough votes for induction in his second year of eligibility, according to The Athletic. He is one of 15 modern-era finalists that includes fellow quarterback Drew Brees, who is expected to be inducted in his first year of eligibility. While it likely won't have the same viral reaction as Belichick's snub, Manning's exclusion from this year's Hall of Fame class is nonetheless notable. Manning is just one of six players in history to own multiple Super Bowl MVPs. The three Hall of Fame-eligible players from that select fraternity (Joe Montana, Terry Bradshaw and Bart Starr) were inducted in their first year of eligibility. The other two (Tom Brady and Patrick Mahomes) will almost certainly receive the same treatment as soon are they are eligible for induction. \n        \n            \n                Bill Belichick's snub demands a Hall of Fame reckoning\n                \n                    Jonathan Jones                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nManning is one of just two eligible starting quarterbacks with multiple Super Bowl wins that is not in the Hall of Fame. The other is Jim Plunkett, who helped lead the Raiders to upset wins over Philadelphia and Washington in Super Bowls XV and XVIII, respectively. \nManning's detractors often point to his 117-117 regular season record and 60.3% career completion percentage as reasons to keep him out when there are several quarterbacks in the Hall of Fame whose numbers are similar or worse. Joe Namath, for example, went 62-63-4 as a starting quarterback and had 173 career touchdown passes and 220 interceptions. Namath's Hall of Fame bust is mostly due to his role in the greatest upset in NFL history when the New York Jets -- an 18-point underdog -- stunned the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III. Like Namath, Manning also played a key role in one of the biggest upsets in NFL history when he helped the Giants upset the previously undefeated Patriots in Super Bowl XLII. And while Namath didn't throw a single pass during the fourth quarter of his upset win, Manning's fourth quarter against the Patriots included two touchdown passes (including the game-winner) and an iconic completion to David Tyree that immediately became part of Super Bowl lore. \nFour years later, Manning defeated the Patriots again on football's biggest stage. While it is often forgotten, the Giants' win that day was largely the byproduct of a brilliant throw from Manning to Mario Manningham that set up the game-winning touchdown. \nSuper Bowls aside, Manning is one of the greatest playoff quarterbacks of all-time. During the Giants' two Super Bowl runs, Manning led all postseason quarterbacks in attempts, passing yards and touchdown passes. He had one of the greatest playoff runs in league history in 2011 when he completed 65% of his passes for 1,219 yards and nine touchdowns over a four-game span. It's also worth noting that Manning has the third-longest consecutive starts streak in league history behind only Hall of Famer Brett Favre and fellow 2004 draft classmate Philip Rivers. Manning is also 11th all-time in both career passing yards and career touchdown passes. \nDespite those numbers, Manning reportedly did not get enough votes to join his older brother, Peyton, in the Hall of Fame this time around. \n            ",

He also leads the 49ers in receiving, catching 92 passes for 849 yards (9.2 average) and seven touchdowns. In the win at Indianapolis, he carried 21 times for 117 yards, while catching eight passes for 29 yards and two touchdowns.

    "body": "\nThe San Francisco 49ers host the Chicago Bears in the Week 17 edition of 'Sunday Night Football' at 8:20 p.m. ET. Both teams are battling for playoff positioning, so they won't be holding anything back as the regular season begins to wind down. Top options in the NFL DFS player pool include Christian McCaffrey, Caleb Williams, D'Andre Swift and Brock Purdy. Both teams have some injury concerns at the skill positions with Chicago receiver Rome Odunze (foot) ruled out and the Niners listing tight end George Kittle (ankle) and Ricky Pearsall (knee, ankle) as questionable.How should you build your NFL DFS lineups for 'Sunday Night Football,' and which sleepers should factor into your NFL DFS strategy? Before making any Bears vs. 49ers DFS picks, be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure.You can also bet props like D'Andre Swift as anytime TD scorer (+140) using the latest DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins:\nMcClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings. He uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every snap of NFL action, taking factors such as matchups, statistical trends, and injuries into account. This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings, including. In 2023, he finished tied for first in the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once. Anyone who has followed him could be way up.Now, McClure has turned his attention to the 'Sunday Night Football' DFS slate and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. Top NFL DFS picks for Bears vs. 49ersOne of McClure's top NFL DFS picks is San Francisco running back Christian McCaffrey. One of the premier daily Fantasy options in the league, McCaffrey enters this matchup on a five-game touchdown streak. He also had 146 scrimmage yards last week against the Colts. He produced 117 of those on the ground, but his two touchdowns came via short passes, illustrating how tough it is to contain him for opposing defenses. See who else to roster at SportsLine.You can also bet on McCaffrey to go Over 117.5 rushing + receiving yards (-113) at DraftKings:\nHe's also building around Bears tight end Colston Loveland. He's still being used in plenty of two tight-end sets with Cole Kmet, but Loveland, the rookie out of Michigan, has become the clear TE1 in this offense. Ben Johnson's offense produced huge numbers for Sam LaPorta as a rookie and second-year player in 2023 and 2024, and Loveland is pacing in the same direction. The Niners are tough overall on defense, but have given up the 22nd most Fantasy points to opposing tight ends. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine.Bet Loveland to go Over 40.5 receiving yards (-112) at DraftKings:\nHow to set 49ers vs. Bears NFL DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Sunday Night Football'. This pick could be the difference between winning your tournaments and cash games or going home with nothing. You can only see who it is, and the rest of McClure's NFL DFS picks, at SportsLine.So who is Mike McClure including in his optimal NFL DFS lineups for 'Sunday Night Football', and which under-the-radar player offers huge value? Visit SportsLine now to see optimal NFL DFS picks, NFL DFS rankings, NFL DFS advice and NFL DFS stacks, all from a daily Fantasy expert with more than $2 million in winnings, and find out. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Giannis Antetokounmpo returned from an eight-game absence Saturday night to lead the Milwaukee Bucks to a 112-103 win over the Chicago Bulls. The two-time MVP poured in 29 points, which he capped off with a fastbreak windmill dunk in the final two seconds after the game was already well decided.After the final buzzer sounded, Bulls forward Nikola VucevicVučević and guard Coby White approached Antetokounmpo to share their irritation with his unnecessary dunk which led to both benches emptying to defuse the situation.\n\"We're 11th in the East,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"Got to keep finding an identity. And if that's to get a little bit of scrappy at the end, so be it. We're not champs. Why should we play the clock out and have respect and fair play? We're fighting for our lives right now.\"The Bucks went 2-6 in Antetokounmpo's absence, and are just 13-19 on the season. While it's a night-and-day difference when Giannis is on the floor, the Bucks struggled to consistently string together wins, even in a weak Eastern Conference.\"This is real tough,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"I've been 13 years in the league. If we keep on losing, probably half of the team not going to be here. We're not going to make the playoffs. I really don't care. At the end of the day, I just want to be available, be healthy and help my team win. And if [a windmill dunk] is what has to happen for everybody to wake up and understand, we're fighting for our lives and we got to get our hands dirty, so be it.\"\nBulls players took exception with Antetokounmpo's actions.\"He shouldn't have dunked the ball,\" White said after the game. \"It's disrespectful to the game. I said, 'Bro, you're better than that.' The game is over with. Why you got to do that? It's a respect thing.\"Vučević tried to rationalize Antetokounmpo's actions, saying, \"I'm assuming Giannis was mad about that report that came out the Bulls didn't want to trade for him.\"\nTrade hype hovered over the Bucks for most of the season after a report surfaced that Antetokounmpo may request one by midseason. There are conflicting reports about his actual willingness to request a trade, but comments last night suggest he is not happy with the state of things in Milwaukee.\n            ",

Williams said something to Alvarado who grabbed Williams and the two started going at it, with Alvarado throwing punches and connecting with a right hook. \nAlvarado and Williams were both ejected for their roles in the scrap, which was a far more legitimate fight than most tussles we see happen on an NBA court. The best part of it all was Jordan Poole's face in the background when Alvarado landed the punch (0:35 mark of the above video). Alvarado was still hot after getting pulled away and sprinted to the back, seemingly ready to continue things in the hallway by the locker rooms. Williams was less aggressive in his role in the brouhaha, which likely accounts for the shorter penalty.\nThe Suns went on to win, 123-114, after the fight to notch back-to-back wins in New Orleans and improve to 18-13 on the season, as they battle for a playoff spot in the West. \n            \n    ",

The Niners are just 6-8 ATS over their last 14 games when at a rest disadvantage. On the field, the Bears lead the NFL in the statistic that most correlates with winning and losing, and that's turnover differential. Chicago is plus-21 in that regard, while the second-place team is at just plus-15. Chicago has forced the most turnovers (31) and it has committed the second-fewest (10). When the Niners lose the turnover battle this season, they are just 3-4 against the spread, and San Francisco's defense has the fewest sacks in the NFL. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the 49ers can coverRiding a five-game win streak, San Francisco leads the NFL in points per game, points per drive and 3rd-down offense during this run, and each of the five victories have come by double-digits. The offense has been unstoppable over the last two games in particular, as the Niners are just the fifth team in the last 75 years to go back-to-back outings without punting the ball, and now it gets to face the No. 27 run defense. Though he doesn't qualify for statistical leaderboards due to time missed, Brock Purdy leads the NFL in QBR and is among the top five in touchdown percentage, completion percentage and passer rating. Additionally, the 49ers are 4-0 both straight up and ATS on primetime in 2025. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Bears vs. 49ers  picksSportsLine's model has simulated Niners vs. Bears  10,000 times is going Over on the total, projecting 53 combined points.

That will be the 272nd and final game of the 2025 season and the winner will clinch the AFC North title along with the final playoff spot in the AFC. The Steelers and Ravens met back in Week 14 with Pittsburgh topping Baltimore, 27-22. The biggest game of the weekend will arguably be happening on Saturday with the Seahawks hitting the road to face the 49ers in a massive NFC West showdown. There will be a lot on the line in that game with the winner taking home the NFC West title and the No. 1 overall seed in the NFC. That means the winner will get a bye in the opening round of the playoffs while the loser will be forced to hit the road for the wild card round.In the early game on Saturday, the Buccaneers will be hosting the Panthers in a game that will likely decide the NFC South. If the Falcons lose to the Rams on Monday night, then the Panthers-Buccaneers game will be a winner-take-all battle for the division title (The Panthers could lose to the Bucs and still win the division title if the Falcons win their final two games). The No. 1 seed in the AFC will be decided on Sunday. The Broncos will be hosting the Chargers at 4:25 p.m. ET on CBS and if they win that game, they'll clinch the top seed. However, if the Broncos lose, the Patriots could sneak in and steal the top seed by beating the Dolphins. With that in mind, let's check out the full Week 18 schedule: \n        \n            \n                NFL playoff picture: Ravens-Steelers to decide AFC North in Week 18; Panthers have two paths to postseason\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSaturday, Jan. 3\nPanthers at Buccaneers, 4:30 p.m. ET (ESPN/ABC)Seahawks at 49ers, 8 p.m. ET (ESPN/ABC)Sunday, Jan. 4Packers at Vikings, 1 p.m. ET (CBS)Browns at Bengals, 1 p.m. ET (CBS)Colts at Texans, 1 p.m. ET (CBS)Cowboys at Giants, 1 p.m. ET (Fox)Saints at Falcons, 1 p.m. ET (Fox)Titans at Jaguars, 1 p.m. ET (Fox)Chargers at Broncos, 4:25 p.m. ET (CBS)Chiefs at Raiders, 4:25 p.m. ET (CBS)Commanders at Eagles, 4:25 p.m. ET (CBS)Jets at Bills, 4:25 p.m. ET (CBS)Dolphins at Patriots, 4:25 p.m. ET (Fox)Lions at Bears 4:25 p.m. ET (Fox)Cardinals at Rams, 4:25 p.m. ET (Fox)Ravens at Steelers, 8:20 p.m. ET (NBC)\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

They were, however, on the wrong end of the scoreboard, and Garrett believes there was a strong correlation between the two.\n\"To an extent, I feel like they were more worried about keeping me away from Aaron [Rodgers] than, you know, getting the win, and I think that's what came back to bite them,\" Garrett said after the Browns' 13-6 upset win in Cleveland. \"They'll have to fight it out with Baltimore next week, but I'm just proud of the guys for fighting and getting this win. That's the main thing, and I'm always gonna keep it that.\"Garrett, who was often chipped by a running back or tight end or outright double-teamed, managed just two pressures on 43 pass rush snaps, a 4.7% rate. That was his second-lowest of the season; he had just a 4.2% pressure rate in the Week 6 game against Pittsburgh.Garrett remains at 22 sacks on the season, one behind breaking the record of 22.5 shared by Michael Strahan (2001) and T.J. Watt (2021). Sunday represented Garrett's first game without at least a half-sack since that aforementioned Week 6 game against Pittsburgh. The Cleveland defense still dominated, though: Alex Wright and Grant Delpit both sacked Rodgers, who had a season-low 4.3 yards per attempt. As a result, the Steelers will host the Baltimore Ravens for the AFC North title in Week 18; Pittsburgh could have clinched the division with a win in Cleveland.\nGarrett, meanwhile, will have one more shot at the record when the Browns visit the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 18. Garrett had two sacks in the Week 1 matchup between the two teams.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\nWe've reached the penultimate week of the 2025 NFL season, and as some teams are trying to improve their playoff positioning, others are trying to just get across the finish line after disappointing campaigns. Injuries are playing a major part of the Week 17 schedule, and bettors looking to place NFL bets for Week 17 need to know the most important NFL injuries of the week, as well as what NFL betting lines look like per the latest DraftKings Sportsbook odds. We will update this post with inactives lists for every team prior to kickoff.Seahawks at Panthers (1 p.m. ET)No major injuries of note\nBoth teams are in good shape in the health department for this pivotal Week 17 clash. The Seahawks are in the driver's seat for both the NFC West crown as well as the No. 1 seed in the conference. Carolina knocked off Tampa Bay last week and, with a win and Bucs loss this week, could clinch the NFC South. Otherwise, Week 18 could be a massive matchup for the division title. Seattle is favored by 7. The total is 42.5.Buccaneers at Dolphins (1 p.m. ET)No major injuries of note\nBoth teams have a few players banged up here, but none that move the needle when it comes to betting lines. The Bucs are a game behind the Panthers in the NFC South and, with a win, would ensure that Week 18's rematch with Carolina has high stakes. The Buccaneers are 5.5-point favorites, and the total is 44.5Patriots at Jets (1 p.m. ET)NE RB TreVeyon Henderson (concussion, available)NE WR Kayshon Boutte (concussion, out) NYJ TE Mason Taylor (neck, out)\nNew England standout running back TreVeyon Henderson has cleared concussion protocol for Sunday while New York is again without tight end Mason Taylor, who was a rare bright spot in a trying year for the Jets. Explosive Patriots receiver Kayshon Boutte is out with a concussion. The Pats are massive 13.5-point favorites, and the total is 42.5.Steelers at Browns (1 p.m. ET)CLE RB Quinshon Judkins (ankle, out for year)CLE RB Dylan Sampson (hand, available)CLE TE Harold Fannin Jr. (groin, available)CLE TE David Njoku (knee, out)PITT LB T.J. Watt (lung, out)\nThe Browns are looking to play spoiler here, and their offense is hurting. Star rookie back Quinshon Judkins is out for the year after ankle surgery, so fellow rookie Dylan Sampson is the team's RB1 this week. He's active after missing the last two games. David Njoku is out again with a knee injury and fellow tight end, standout rookie Harold Fannin Jr., is good to play. The Steelers will still be without T.J. Watt this week after the star edge rusher underwent surgery to repair a collapsed lung. He returned to practice this week but will not suit up until Week 18 at the earliest. Pittsburgh is a 3-point favorite on the road, and the total is 34.5 -- the lowest of Week 17.  Jaguars at Colts (1 p.m. ET)IND CB Sauce Gardner (calf, available)\nThe Jags are relatively healthy here, while the Colts, who started the year 8-2, are trying to win out and get some help to sneak into the postseason as a wild card team. Indianapolis traded two first-round picks at the deadline for cornerback Sauce Gardner, who will return to the lineup after a lengthy absence. The Jaguars can clinch the AFC South with a win here if the Texans also lose to or tie with the Chargers on Saturday. Jacksonville is a 5.5-point favorite. The total is 48.5.Saints at Titans (1 p.m. ET)NO RB Alvin Kamara (knee and ankle, out)NO WR Chris Olave (back, available)\nThe Saints will again be without standout running back Alvin Kamara, though they found an interesting replacement last week in tight end/quarterback/running back hybrid Taysom Hill, who had 78 yards from scrimmage and also a passing score to Chris Olave, who is good to go after being listed as questionable.The Saints are favored by 2.5, and the total is 39.5.Cardinals at Bengals (1 p.m. ET)ARI S Budda Baker (concussion and thumb, out)ARI WR Marvin Harrison Jr. (heel, available)\nBoth teams have crowded injury reports, but the Cardinals continue to have some awful luck in that department for Week 17. Star safety Budda Baker is out, putting a dent in an already poor Arizona defense. The offense got Marvin Harrison Jr. back last week and he's active again this week despite battling a heel injury. The Bengals are 7.5-point favorites. The total is 53.5 -- the highest of the week.Giants at Raiders (4:05 p.m. ET)LV DE Maxx Crosby (knee, out)LV TE Brock Bowers (knee, out for year)\nStar Raiders edge rusher Maxx Crosby is out this week against the Giants, and there's reportedly drama between him and the team. Per Ian Rapoport of NFL Network, the Raiders told Crosby they wanted to shut him down for the remaining two games, and he disagreed and left the facility. Additionally, the team placed second-year tight end Brock Bowers on season-ending injured reserve this week.New York is a slim 1.5-point favorite. The total is 41.5.Eagles at Bills (4:25 p.m. ET)BUF TE Dalton Kincaid (knee, out)BUF TE Dawson Knox (knee, available)PHI OT Lane Johnson (knee, foot, out)\nBuffalo will roll with Dawson Knox as the starting tight end while Dalton Kincaid remains out for this potential Super Bowl preview against last year's champs, the Eagles. Philadelphia will get star defensive tackle Jalen Carter back after a brief absence, but it won't have right tackle Lane Johnson once again. Buffalo is a 1.5-point favorite, and the total is 43.5.Bears at 49ers (8:20 p.m. ET)CHI WR Rome Odunze (foot, out)SF TE George Kittle (ankle, questionable)SF WR Ricky Pearsall (knee, questionable)\nThis potential NFL playoff preview has a few big-name pass catchers out or questionable. The Bears will again be down second-year receiver Rome Odunze as he battles a foot injury, and Chicago will certainly be aiming to get him back for the postseason. As for the 49ers, star tight end George Kittle is questionable after not practicing all week while receiver Ricky Pearsall is in danger of missing his ninth game of the year. San Francisco is favored by 3, and the total is 52.5.Rams at Falcons (8:15 p.m. ET, Monday)LAR WR Davante Adams (hamstring, doubtful)ATL WR Drake London (knee, questionable)\nAll eyes are on the status of two star receivers as Davante Adams, who leads the NFL in touchdown receptions, is doubtful for the Rams after missing last week's loss to Seattle while Drake London is questionable for Atlanta as he continues to battle a nagging knee injury. The Rams can help themselves in two ways on Sunday as a win helps their playoff standing and also pushes the Falcons further up the NFL Draft order, which is good for L.A. as the team owns Atlanta's first-round pick in April.Los Angeles is a 7.5-point road favorite. The total is 49.5.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 season is far from over but it's already time inspect the report card of the most expensive 2025 summer transfer window moves. Players like Alexander Isak, Florian Wirtz and Benjamin Sesko kept us busy last summer with their moves, but their start of the season with their new clubs haven't gone as expected, while others have performed up to expectations and beyond. With the 2026 winter transfer window about to start, let's go back and grade the most expensive 2025 summer transfers: 10. Matheus CunhaFrom Wolverhampton to Manchester United for $84.5 million (add-ons included)Three goals scored so far in 16 games played between Premier League and EFL Cup with Manchester United, under Ruben Amorim, the former Wolverhampton striker has played regularly and he's having an impact, starting the last nine Premier League fixtures, scoring also two goals in the last three. He's improving, and the feeling is that things can get even better in the near future. Good start. Grade: B9. Victor Osimhen From Napoli to Galatasaray for $87.5 million (add-ons included)Even if this signing wasn't as exciting as the others on this list, the former Napoli striker performed wonderfully in the team he moved to in the summer of 2024 on loan. Galatasaray decided to invest big on him last summer, and they were wise in doing so -- 12 goals scored in 16 games so far, including six scored in the four games played in the Champions League league phase. It looks like he's fitting well in this team and he can achieve big things at Galatasaray this season. Grade: A8. Luis Diaz From Liverpool to Bayern Munich for $88.5 million (add-ons included)By far the best signing in the top 10. Luis Diaz is doing great things in Germany at Bayern Munich where he has already scored 13 goals in the 22 matches he played so far in all competitions, and also seven assists provided to his teammates. One goal every 137 minutes and an incredible impact in the team coached by Vincent Kompany, he is quickly becoming one of the big stars of the German giants. Grade: A+\n7. Eberechi EzeFrom Crystal Palace to Arsenal for $91 million (add-ons included)There were high expectations and ambitions after his late move to Arsenal after he almost agreed terms to join Tottenham. It was one of the biggest stories and surprises of the summer transfer window, and to be honest, we could expect a bit more from his performances. But he has done well in some exciting matches, particularly when he scored the hat trick, ironically against Tottenham in the North London derby won 4-1 by the Gunners. Grade: B6. Nick WoltemadeFrom Stuttgart to Newcastle for $93 million (add-ons included)The German striker suffered a bit from the poor performances and results of Newcastle in the opening part of the season, as the Magpies are currently sitting 14th in the Premier League standings with 23 points after 18 games. On the other hand, Woltemade already scored nine goals with his new team and showed to be at the level of the Premier League and his rivals. If his team also improve, we can expect a lot more goals from him. Grade: B-5. Bryan Mbuemo From Brentford to Manchester United for $95 million (add-ons included)Let's be honest -- when Manchester United signed him this summer, we all thought this was going to be another disappointment. Welp. Seven goals scored so far in the 17 matches he played, he immediately became one of the key players of the team coached by Amorim. He's now in Morocco where he's playing the AFCON with Cameroon, and Manchester United hope to see him back in the team as soon as possible. They need him. Grade: B+\n4. Benjamin Sesko From RB Leipzig to Manchester United for $99 million (add-ons included)The exact opposite of Mbuemo. Back in the summer, I thought he was going to shine and become an important player of Manchester United but so far he has only scored two goals in the 17 matches he has played with the Red Devils. I was expecting a bigger impact and stronger numbers from a player who has consistently impressed me in recent years, but he still has time. At just 22, there is a lot of potential waiting to be realized. Grade: C-3. Hugo Ekitike From Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool for $106 million (add-ons included)The French international immediately proved to be a crucial player in the team coached by Arne Slot. Ekitike has already scored 11 goals in the 24 matches he played and was definitely the best signing made by Liverpool this season, also because the other ones were really disappointing, at least up to now. Grade: B+2. Florian WirtzFrom Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool for $157 million (add-ons included). If the Ekitike signing was one of the best ones, we can't say the same about the Florian Wirtz move to Liverpool from Bayer Leverkusen, especially considering the money the English team spent for the German striker. Wirtz scored his first goal for his new club over the weekend against Wolverhampton, but expectations were higher. There is still time for him to improve and adapting to the Premier League is never easy in the short term. He will need to show more in the second half of the season. Grade: C-\n1. Alexander Isak From Newcastle to Liverpool for $168 million (add-ons included). The Swedish striker was really disappointing so far, especially considering the money spent and the expectations after the saga of his transfer from Newcastle to Liverpool. He has scored only three goals in the first part of the season and is now sidelined with a leg injury that could keep him out for potentially months. They hoped something different in Liverpool. Grade: D\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The NFL world has seen the last of Maxx Crosby this season. Is it possible this is also the last of him with the Las Vegas Raiders? The Raiders shut down Crosby due to a knee injury, placing him on injured reserve. However, this was a decision with which the five-time Pro Bowler \"vehemently\" disagreed, according to Jay Glazer of Fox. Crosby argued he is healthy enough to play, and wanted to finish out the season. This decision will cause Crosby to evaluate his future with the Raiders organization, according to NFL Media. Glazer reports he spoke with Crosby on the phone, and relayed that the star pass rusher is \"not a happy camper right now.\" Crosby is set to have a meniscus trim, which is not a major procedure. On Saturday, he posted pictures and videos of him playing basketball and on a trampoline to his social media, which showed that he's not in debilitating pain that would force him off the field. The Raiders even felt the need to release a statement explaining their decision to place Crosby on injured reserve:\n\"After deliberate and thorough consultation with multiple top medical professionals, it became clear that this decision is in the best interest of both the franchise and the player. Maxx is the ultimate warrior, and he has fought extremely hard to compete each week with his teammates since injuring his knee mid-season.\"We are grateful for his extraordinary contributions. He is a true Raider on and off the field. We look forward to his leadership and toughness into 2026 and beyond.\"In 15 games played, Crosby recorded 73 tackles, 28 tackles for loss, 20 QB hits, 10 sacks, six passes defensed and his first career interception. Just nine months ago, Crosby signed a three-year, $106.5 million extension that includes $91.5 million guaranteed. The contract made him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history at the time. Crosby wanted to remain loyal to the franchise that selected him in the fourth round out of Eastern Michigan in 2019, even though he's seen just one winning season. It's possible things may have changed. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Maxxine Dupri is under the microscope. Every milestone match of hers has played out for a global audience. With the WWE women's intercontinental championship resting on her shoulder, that won't change anytime soon.  The most successful wrestling characters are often amplified projections of the people portraying them, and Dupri embraces that philosophy. She's as novice as she is bubbly, and no one is pretending otherwise. While some may take issue with her winning a singles title so early, many fans connect with Dupri as an authentic underdog.  \"The most beautiful part about Maxxine's character is that it's really  me. I'm learning on the road,\" Dupri told CBS Sports while promoting WrestleMania 42, which returns to Las Vegas on April 18 and 19. \"You get to see my first match on Monday  Night Raw, and those feelings. You get a behind-the-scenes look at who I  am and what I'm going through. I think it's special that fans get to  take that ride with me.\"\nDupri is approaching five years with WWE, but very little of that time was spent inside the ring. She primarily worked as a valet for Maximum Male Models and Alpha Academy, and didn't wrestle her first match until August 2023. That debut wasn't tucked away on a pre-taped episode of Main Event or NXT; it happened under the bright lights of WWE Raw. Two years later, she pinned future WWE Hall of Famer Becky Lynch to win singles gold.  That kind of rapid ascent can rub people the wrong way. Many WWE superstars spend decades plying their craft without ever touching singles gold. Backstage, however, Dupri is reportedly well-liked, and her humility appears to go a long way.\"They're all very aware that my 50th match, including live events, was  when I beat Becky Lynch for the title,\" Dupri said. \"That's the journey I'm on. I'm  very honest about where I'm at. I'm not going to pretend to know about  things that I don't.\" \nDupri's bubbly personality is beginning to give way to a more serious edge. WWE recently aired a dramatic vignette showing her training with Natalya inside The Dungeon, the wrestling school run by Natalya and her husband, WWE producer TJ Wilson. The Dungeon is a spiritual successor to Stu Hart's legendary Hart Dungeon, which shaped the careers of Bret Hart, Owen Hart, and countless others. True to form, the character shift mirrors Dupri's growing confidence as a wrestler.  \"I think it's time we show them exactly why Maxxine is improving...\" Dupri said of the intention behind the cinematic video. \"It's  because of the Dungeon. It's because of Nattie and TJ. It's because of  those moments. I thought it was special to peel that curtain back and  show the fans.\"\nWith WrestleMania 42 on the horizon, Dupri isn't shying away from the spotlight; it's the only world she knows. And if she has it her way, Becky Lynch will be waiting for her in Las Vegas.  \n            ",

    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL playoffs are here as six matchups are set to unfold over the course of Saturday, Sunday and Monday. The latest Wild Card Weekend NFL odds from DraftKings Sportsbook lists the Rams at -10.5 vs. the Panthers and the Bears at -1 vs. the Packers on Saturday. On Sunday, the latest NFL lines have the Bills at -1.5 vs. the Jaguars, the Eagles at -3.5 vs. the 49ers and the Patriots at -3.5 vs. the Chargers. A playoff edition of 'Monday Night Football' concludes the slate with the Texans favored by 3.5 points on the road against the Steelers.  SportsLine's Eric Cohen has revealed his exact score prediction for each game to help you formulate spread, over/under, money-line and even NFL best bets as Wild Card Weekend approaches.A SportsLine expert and CBS on-air talent, Cohen has evaluated the entire NFL playoff slate and delivers score predictions and logic for each matchup. Cohen went 180-91-1 (66%) on his NFL straight-up picks this season, and was a sizzling 10-3 (77%) on his straight-up NFL playoff picks last season. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now he's turned his attention to the 2026 NFL Wild Card Weekend, studied each matchup in depth, and has revealed his exact NFL score predictions for each game. All Week 18 NFL betting lines via DraftKings Sportsbook.Los Angeles Rams (-10.5) at Carolina Panthers\n\"Carolina won this matchup on November 30, 31-28, in one of the more impactful upsets for both teams in the NFL this season,\" Cohen said. \"That's not happening again. While Sean McVay's team hasn't looked great lately, they'll exact serious revenge as a double-digit road favorite on Saturday. The Panthers have absolutely no business being in the playoffs and it's going to be a wake up call to the other teams in the conference. I would be mildly surprised if this wasn't a blowout.\"Pick: Rams 34, Panthers 12Green Bay Packers at Chicago Bears (-1)\n\"This will be the NFC North rivals' third matchup since December 7,\" Cohen said. \"Green Bay held on by a touchdown in the first one, before blowing a 10 point lead in the final two minutes and falling in overtime. I believe that Packers coach Matt LaFleur's job is on the line. While his team makes the playoffs just about every season, they have lost four of their last five in the postseason and finished the 2025 regular season on a four game losing streak. I'm just not sure the Bears are ready for this kind of pressure, especially against a rested Green Bay team. In another thriller on Saturday night, the Packers exact a matter of revenge for the Week 16 collapse.\"Pick: Packers 23, Bears 21Buffalo Bills (-1.5) at Jacksonville Jaguars\n\"Winners of nine of their last 10 games, I have a hard time picking against Jacksonville at home,\" Cohen said. \"Buffalo's passing game is devoid of weapons and the Jaguars boast the NFL's top rush defense to slow Josh Allen and James Cook. While Allen and the Bills are 5-0 in the Wild Card Round since 2020, all five of those games have been at home. Trevor Lawrence has played at an MVP level since November and it will continue this weekend. The Jaguars win on a walk-off Cam Little field goal from 50-plus yards. If this result plays out as I anticipate, Sean McDermott won't be back to coach Buffalo next season.\"Pick: Jaguars 27, Bills 24San Francisco 49ers at Philadelphia Eagles (-3.5)\n\"With Philadelphia only giving 3.5 points on the early line, this is my favorite spread play of the Wild Card games,\" Cohen said. \"This is a matchup between the two NFC teams who have played in the last three Super Bowls, but I don't trust San Francisco's defense to hold up against the Eagles' potent receivers and Saquon Barkley on the ground. San Francisco had potentially three straight home games in front of them with a win against Seattle in Week 18. Now, after an offensive dud against the Seahawks, their season ends in disappointment in the City of Brotherly Love.\"Pick: Eagles 27, 49ers 21Los Angeles Chargers at New England Patriots (-3.5)\n\"My top play in this game is the Under 45.5 (though I may buy it up a few points in my weekend parlays),\" Cohen said. \"Both of these teams give up less than 21 points per game so don't expect fireworks. Of the Patriots' 14 wins, only three came against playoff teams (Panthers, Bills, Ravens) so they might have benefitted from a ridiculously weak schedule. Then again, the Chargers only beat two playoff teams (Broncos, Eagles), so I can't use that to their advantage. In their second playoffs under Jim Harbaugh (in two years), I think L.A. leads most of the game, with Drake Maye leading a late New England rally. \"Pick: Patriots 23, Chargers 21 Houston Texans (-3.5) at Pittsburgh Steelers \n\"I can't believe Aaron Rodgers found a way in the playoffs yet again,\" Cohen said. \"I have to think this is it for him either way. The Texans' defense should overwhelm the future Hall of Famer and hold Pittsburgh fairly in check. Entering the playoffs on a nine game winning streak and facing a team who I believe is a class below them, I think Houston's offense does enough to win. One betting note: Houston kicker Ka'imi Fairbairn had multiple field goal attempts in all 15 games he played in this season and hit his Over 1.5 made FGs in 14/15. Whatever the juice is, lay it in this game.\"Pick: Texans 23, Steelers 10How to get more NFL Wild Card Weekend picksSportsLine's model has simulated every Wild Card Weekend Game 10,000 times and revealed its picks.

    "body": "\n        With a month until the NBA trade deadline on Feb. 5, we are now entering the time of year where rumors get stronger about players who could be on the move and the teams that are interested in them.  This year there are a handful of big names popping up as trade targets, with Anthony Davis in Dallas and Trae Young in Atlanta among the headliners as two former All-Stars that are known to be available. On Monday, we got some updates on the status of trade talks involving those two, as well as a rare public comment on a trade rumor from an NBA owner. Let's take a spin around the NBA rumor mill and roundup the latest buzz in the Association. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Trae Young, Hawks working on a trade, Wizards have 'legitimate' interestIt appears the Trae Young Era will be ending in Atlanta in the coming month. The Hawks and Young's agents are working on finding a trade that will send the All-Star guard out of Atlanta, per ESPN. Young has spent seven-and-a-half seasons in Atlanta and has made four All-Star teams.Trading Trae Young is a tricky proposition for Atlanta, because with a $49 million player option for next year, Young will want to go somewhere that will offer him a big extension this summer. Finding a team that views Young as that level of star worth a significant investment isn't easy, but a division rival of the Hawks may be the answer. \nAccording to Marc Stein, the Washington Wizards are a \"legitimate potential trade destination\" for Young and a deal for the former All-Star guard could utilize CJ McCollum's expiring contract to make the money work. Washington is a team in the midst of their third straight season of tanking, and must view Young as the kind of player worth adding to try and take the next step as a team next season. \n        \n            \n                NBA trade predictions for 10 biggest names: AD, Trae Young and more on the move, will Giannis stay put?\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWe don't often see teams make trades in their division, but the Hawks -- who have also recently been linked to Anthony Davis -- won't have the luxury of being picky in Young talks. If they can move him without taking on long-term money and can get back something in the way of a positive asset, they would likely be thrilled. This season was always going to be pivotal for the relationship between Young and the Hawks, and the way Atlanta has played without Young on the floor and with Jalen Johnson as their top star has made it clear Young's long-term future isn't as the Hawks' top option.For his part, Young is \"openminded\" to a trade, as ESPN's Marc Spears reported, although he is not outright demanding one. While going to a team that is rebuilding would put Young back in the place the Hawks were last year, if the Wizards are willing to pay him big money this summer he probably wouldn't mind a move to the nation's capital. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Ishbia makes bold Dillon Brooks claimThe Phoenix Suns have been one of the NBA's most pleasant surprises this season, currently sitting seventh in the West at 21-14 after their latest win came on a Devin Booker buzzer-beater against the Thunder. The vibes in the desert are drastically different than they were last year when their star-studded roster was imploding, but some have posited they could try to sell high on some players as they look to a quick rebuild and reload in Phoenix. Former NBA player DeMarcus Cousins threw out Dillon Brooks as a guy the Lakers should target, and suggested they trade Austin Reaves to Phoenix for Brooks. While you'd expect Lakers fans to push back on that deal given Reaves' emergence as a legit star this season, it was Suns owner Mat Ishbia who issued the strongest response to Cousins' idea, proclaiming on social media the Suns wouldn't be interested in that deal and that Brooks is \"not going anywhere.\" \nThat's quite the vote of confidence for Brooks, who is averaging a career-high 21.4 points per game in his first season in Phoenix after being acquired from Houston in the Kevin Durant trade this summer. \nMany wondered if he could be gettable for a contender looking for a jolt on the wing, but Ishbia put up a very public \"not for sale\" sign on Monday to shut down those rumblings. While there's still a month for things to change, it certainly seems like Phoenix is planning on giving this group a chance to see what they can do in a surprisingly strong campaign. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Anthony Davis prefers extension in Dallas to tradeWhen the Mavericks fired GM Nico Harrison, all signs pointed to an Anthony Davis trade being the next domino in Dallas. The problem for Dallas is, Davis wants a massive extension this summer and given his injury history, not a lot of teams are lining up to trade for him knowing what he'll be asking for in his next deal. It's been nearly two months since Davis rumors started and there hasn't been any indication any team has gotten particularly deep in discussions with Dallas about the star. With one month left until the deadline, there's a real question as to whether anyone will make the Mavs an offer they're interested in. With that in mind, ESPN's Tim MacMahon reported on Monday that Davis would rather stay in Dallas and sign an extension than get traded -- and if he is dealt, he'll be expecting an extension to be awaiting him as part of the deal. \nDavis is owed $120 million over the next two years -- including a $63 million player option for 2027-28 -- and will be eligible for a four-year, $275 million extension this summer. Not a lot of teams want to make that kind of offer, and what would be more interesting is where would Dallas draw in the line in negotiations if they don't move him. It's clear given the trade rumors surrounding him they don't view him as the centerpiece of the future on a team that includes No. 1 overall pick Cooper Flagg, which begs the question of why they'd commit to a huge, long-term deal if they can't get the return they want for him. While no team wants to see a star walk for nothing, there's an argument one could make that Dallas would be better off with that as an outcome than giving Davis that kind of extension. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        FRISCO, Texas -- If there's one area to blame when it comes to the Dallas Cowboys' 7-9-1 2025 season that resulted in the team missing the playoffs for the second year in a row, it's the defense.Dallas' offense averaged 27.7 points per game, the seventh-best in the NFL, but the defense allowed 30.1 points per game, the most in the league and the second-most points per game allowed in the 66-season history of the Cowboys. Only Dallas' inaugural 1960 squad that finished 0-11-1 was a worse scoring defense than the 2025 unit, allowing 30.8 points per game. The lack of defensive production this season came in defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus' first season in this capacity for Dallas and All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons' first season away from the Cowboys. Owner/general manager Jerry Jones traded him away a week before the season began and didn't make any big moves to compensate for that loss until acquiring former All-Pro defensive tackle Quinnen Williams from the New York Jets at the NFL trade deadline during the Cowboys' Week 10 bye. Williams racked up 32 quarterback pressures from the time he made his Dallas debut in Week 11 through the end of the season, a figure that ranks as the 12th-most in the NFL in that span and the third-most among defensive tackles in that time. That's why he ended up being the Cowboys defense's sole Pro Bowl player in 2025. \nDespite ex-Cowboys Pro Bowl cornerback Trevon Diggs clashing about zone vs. man coverage usage all seasons before Dallas released him after Week 17, Williams vouched for the embattled Eberflus to return as defensive coordinator in 2026 as he took accountability for what went on in between the white lines this season. Eberflus himself took accountability for the defense's performance on Thursday, but he also said he wouldn't go back and do anything differently if he could. \"I love 'Flus man. I haven't really kind of been here [long enough] to know him from a personal standpoint, but the defensive scheme, the things that we did, I think was very, very good. Very smart,\" Williams said Monday at Cowboys locker room cleanout. \"I think us as players had a lot of hand in the pot to kind of execute and do the things that we can do. Because at the end of the day, around the NFL and around the world, Cover 3 is Cover 3. Man [coverage] is man [coverage]. Cover 2 is Cover 2. You got to win your one on ones in all aspects of the game. As players, you got to compete.\" The acquisitions of three-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kenny Clark in the Parsons trade, and Williams midseason boosted the Cowboys' run defense: Dallas was 29th in run defense in 2024 (137.1 rushing yards per game allowed) and 23rd in 2025 (125.5 rushing yards per game allowed). However, the Cowboys ranked as the NFL's worst passing defense, allowing 251.5 passing yards per game because of a lack of sack production without Parsons (35 in 2025, tied for the 11th-fewest in the league) and disarray in coverage in the secondary.   \nCowboys defense under Matt Eberflus in 2025, NFL ranksNFL rankPPG allowed30.1* LastTotal YPG allowed377.030thYards per play allowed6.131stPassing yards per game allowed251.5LastThird down conversion rate allowed 47.3%LastRed zone TD rate allowed 66.7%29thCompletion percentage allowed68.5%30thPass yards per attempt allowed8.131stPasser Rating109.631st* Second-most PPG allowed in a season in the Cowboys' 66-season historyThat's why Williams knows it's on the defense to make great strides this offseason. He forced a career-high three fumbles in 2025, but his sack total of 2.5 tied his career low from his rookie year in 2019. That's an area he knows he needs to improve upon going forward. Williams peaked in that category in 2022 with 12.0 sacks with the Jets. \"I know that we got to get better, especially having the offense that we have,\" Williams said. \"Whatever we got to do to get better, is going to happen. ... I just have to analyze, talk to the coaches and look at things, but I know first and foremost, to point the finger at myself, to try to get better. Especially with being able to be a game-changing tackle and get those big time sack-fumbles and affect the game at a higher level than I did this year. I think that's one step that is going to help us go in the right direction, so I'm super excited. ... I'm super excited for this coaching staff. ... Having 0 [linebacker DeMarvion Overshown] a fully healthy this offseason in his leadership. Having [defensive tackle] Osa [Odighizuwa] in his leadership. [Defensive tackle] Kenny [Clark] a full offseason in his leadership. Me in a full offseason in leadership. So we have the right guys in that unit to get things going in the right direction. No matter who Dallas' defensive coordinator is going forward, he would like to continue playing in an attack front scheme, a scheme that asks the defensive line to play up field and be the aggressors instead of just playing off of the offensive line's blocks. \"It's super important, no matter what scheme I'm in. I want to win,\" Williams said. ... \"What I'm asked to do, I'm willing to do if for the betterment of this team and the betterment of getting better as a defense.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The grind leading up to the All-Star break has begun, bringing with it a plethora of games. This week will see 22 teams playing four times, with the remaining eight teams suiting up on three occasions. With no two-game teams, picking and choosing your roster will be an arduous task.Sitting players who only go two or three times has its advantages, but fantasy managers still have to make smart decisions when figuring out whom to play, regardless of game count. Being aware of back-to-back sets is also a key factor, especially with so many teams now sitting players due to injury management.Four Games: ATL, BOS, CHA, CHI, DEN, GSW, HOU, LAC, MEM, MIA, MIN, NOP, NYK, OKC, ORL, PHI, PHO, POR, SAS, TOR, UTA, WASThree Games: BKN, CLE, DAL, DET, IND, LAL, MIL, SACTwo Games: N/AHere are four potential starts and four potential sits entering the twelfth week of the NBA season. Just keep in mind that this is based on games played for the week. If you play in a rotisserie league, the number of games played each week may not matter in your format.\nGuardsConsider starting: Tre Jones, CHIOpponents: @BOS, @DET, MIA, DALWhile it hasn't all been smooth sailing for Jones since both Josh Giddey and Coby White went down with injuries, his role as the starting point guard seems relatively secure. In his past three appearances as a starter, Jones has averaged 12 points, 8.3 assists, and 0.7 steals. Given his body of work earlier in the season and down the stretch during the 2024-25 campaign, it's safe to assume his defensive contributions should increase moving forward. While he isn't a high-volume scorer, he is typically efficient for a point guard, only taking the shots he knows he can make. While White has been upgraded to questionable for Monday's game, there is every chance he is monitored quite closely, given this was his third calf injury of the season. With four games coming up, Jones makes for a strong starting candidate.Consider starting: Ayo Dosunmu, CHIOpponents: @BOS, @DET, MIA, DALDosunmu has also taken advantage of a favorable situation, playing at least 25 minutes in three of the past four games. Much like Jones, Dosunmu has stepped up over the past three games, averaging 15 points, 3.3 rebounds, 5.7 assists, and two 3-pointers. The possible return of White could have an impact on Dosunmu, although the fact that Jalen Smith is currently in the concussion protocol shouldn't be overlooked. Chicago will have to run with some small lineups, meaning Dosunmu's ability to play multiple positions should see him maintain a sizeable role for the foreseeable future.Consider sitting: Cam Thomas, BKNOpponents: ORL, LAC, @MEMThomas remains on a minutes restriction, having recently returned from a 20-game absence as a result of a hamstring injury. Given he missed a sizeable portion of last season for the same reason, it is likely the medical staff will want to monitor him closely moving forward. While his offensive production has been adequate since returning, rumblings out of Brooklyn are far from positive when it comes to his future with the team. In four appearances since getting back on the floor, Thomas has averaged 20.3 points and two 3-pointers, adding just two rebounds and two assists. His lack of peripheral numbers continues to be an issue, both in fantasy and reality. Despite the scoring upside, with only three games on the slate, Thomas on the bench might be a good look for your team.\nForwardsConsider starting: Justin Champagnie, WASOpponents: ORL, @PHI, NOP, @PHODespite continuing to come off the bench, Champagnie has been a sneaky source of value over the past two weeks. In seven games during that time, he has averaged 11 points, eight rebounds, 1.1 3-pointers, and 1.9 combined steals and blocks, good enough for top 90 value in standard leagues. Despite only playing 18 minutes in Sunday's loss to the Timberwolves, managers should view this as somewhat of an outlier, given the blowout nature of the game. He provides Washington with production all over the floor, a skill set that translates well across most fantasy formats. While not an obvious starting candidate, his floor should at least have him in the discussion for a starting spot, given the favorable schedule.Consider sitting: Naji Marshall, DALOpponents: @SAC, @UTA, @CHIIt's been another up-and-down season for Marshall, typically finding value when others are injured. Despite playing a sizeable role over the past month, Marshall has barely been a top 200 player in standard leagues. In 13 appearances during that span, he has averaged 14.9 points, 3.4 rebounds, and 2.6 assists in 30.1 minutes per game. His value lies in his ability to get to the basket at an efficient rate. However, a lack of supporting numbers drags down his overall value, making him more of a streamer than a must-roster player. If he is hanging onto a spot on your roster, shifting him to the bench for a three-game week makes sense.Consider sitting: Ausar Thompson, DETOpponents: NYK, CHI, LACPlaying time continues to be a source of frustration when it comes to Thompson, with head coach JB Bickerstaff often limiting his minutes, for whatever reason he sees fit. This has resulted in Thompson overplaying his hand, particularly on the defensive end. In 13 games over the past month, Thompson finds himself well outside the top 200, averaging just 11.3 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 2.1 combined steals and blocks in 23.7 minutes per game. He has now played fewer than 25 minutes in four of the past five games, a trend that doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon. He remains a must-roster player, although only in specific builds. If you are one of those who has him on your roster, having him on the bench could certainly reduce your stress levels for the next seven days.\nCentersConsider starting: Sandro Mamukelashvili, TOROpponents: ATL, @CHA, @BOS, PHIThe saga that is Jakob Poeltl continues to roll on. Meanwhile, Mamukelashvili is putting together some tasty fantasy lines. In six games over the past two weeks, he has averaged 11 points, 7.2 rebounds, 1.5 3-pointers, and 2.5 combined steals and blocks. What makes this even more impressive is the fact that he had a zero-point dud against the Nuggets. The eventual return of Poeltl is going to complicate matters, although even when he was healthy, Mamukelashvili was able to flirt with standard league value. Fire him up next week, but remember to keep an eye on Poeltl's availability.Consider sitting: Maxime Raynaud, SACOpponents: DAL, @GSW, HOURaynaud avoided serious injury when he went down with a knee concern during Friday's blowout loss to the Suns, a relief for fantasy managers everywhere. In fact, he was cleared to play only two days later, logging 24 minutes in Sunday's loss to the Bucks. His production of late has been nothing to write home about, averaging 11.3 points and 8.1 rebounds in seven games over the past two weeks. As a rookie center, his ceiling is relatively limited, particularly on the defensive end. He remains a viable asset simply because he is starting. However, with only three games coming up, moving him to the bench feels like a safe decision.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Baltimore Ravens were a field goal away from making the NFL playoffs. The thinnest of margins kept them out of the postseason for the first time since 2021 and left rookie kicker Tyler Loop with an empty feeling. His first year in the league ended on a disappointing note: a missed game-winning field goal attempt in the 26-24 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers. Loop said he knew the ball was headed wide right from the second it hit his foot.The 44-yard try was Loop's first miss from inside 50 yards this season. Everything went properly in his process until foot hit leather. That's when the first-year Raven said he made contact with the ball too low on his shoe.\"Operation was great,\" Loop said after the loss. \"It was a great situation, exactly what we wanted. Unfortunately I just mishit the ball. We call it hitting it thin. It spins fast and it goes off to the right. That was it.\"Loop converted a 40-yarder earlier in the game and was 2-2 on extra point attempts. He said his warmups were solid, each of his prior kicks went off without a hitch and the process on the final play of the game was nearly perfect. The outcome was the only thing that went awry.\"I got back there and looked at the play clock,\" Loop said. \"I saw 22 seconds. Took my steps. Took over. Visualized what the ball looks like when it's held down. Jordan (Stout) picked up his fingers, and that was my cue to go. Saw the ball, tried to visualize the ball going through the uprights where I want it. Swung. The result didn't match my process.\"\nBaltimore invested draft capital in Loop, selecting him in the sixth round out of Arizona. He made a strong first impression during his rookie season, going 30-for-34 on field goal attempts on the year, but displayed room for improvement with three misses from beyond 50 yards and a pair of missed extra points.None of the errors this season were as costly as the one that put the finishing touches on the Ravens' sub-.500 campaign. If Loop converted the attempt, Baltimore would have won the AFC North and secured the No. 4 seed in the playoffs. That would have been quite the feat given that the Ravens opened the year at 1-5 and spent about a quarter of the season without quarterback Lamar Jackson.\"I want to do better,\" Loop said. \"Unfortunately, the nature of the job is you have makes -- and those are awesome -- and then unfortunately you have misses. For that to happen tonight sucks. We've been through a lot of adversity this year as a team early on. We fought, we fought and we fought and worked really hard together. Those guys have had my back, and I want to try my best to have theirs.\n\"It's disappointing and it sucks, but also the nature of the job is I gotta move on and I gotta get ready for the next kick. That's next year. Tomorrow starts training for that.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        FRISCO, Texas -- A first round draft pick by the Dallas Cowboys in 2022, Tyler Smith earned three consecutive Pro Bowl selections (2023-2025) and a 2022 second team All-Pro selection for his play at left guard.However, the Cowboys decided to line Smith up at left tackle for the final three games of the season with 2024 first-round pick left tackle Tyer Guyton on injured reserve with an ankle injury. Now, Smith will meet with head coach Brian Schottenheimer on Monday to figure out what his head coach and offensive play caller feels is his long-term position. \"I do have some thoughts in my mind that I'm going to share with him,\" Smith said Monday at Dallas' locker room cleanout. .. \"Of course I made that move for the team, but we're kind of going to find out what the grand scheme of things is going to be. It might be a conversation that carries on for longer than just today, but at least today will give us clarity.\"    The Cowboys did re-sign Smith during the 2025 season to be the NFL's highest-paid interior offensive lineman with a four-year, $96 million contract extension that gave him an average per year salary of $24 million. The reason for the uncertainty is twofold: Guyton missing nine games with injuries in his first two seasons and the decline of right tackle Terence Steele in pass protection. Steele, at the age of 28 in 2025, allowed 47 quarterback pressures, the most in the NFL according to TruMedia. Since returning from a torn ACL in 2023, Smith's 141 quarterback pressures over the last three seasons are also the most any lineman has allowed in this span, per TruMedia. Releasing him this offseason would save $8.75 million in cap space while giving Dallas $9.375 million in dead money. \nOne route the Cowboys could take is cutting Steele, moving Smith to left tackle and moving Guyton back to right tackle, where he predominantly played at the University of Oklahoma. Another avenue is keeping Guyton at left tackle and Smith at left guard while then releasing Steele and finding a more affordable right tackle in the draft or free agency. If it was up to Smith, he would choose to remain at left guard.  \"The way you build comfort is through reps,\" Smith said. \"Right now, I obviously made a lot of money playing offensive guard. That's what it is. I had the most reps in the NFL I've had at offensive guard. Obviously I'm more comfortable there.\"  The 24-year-old Smith is walking the tightrope between being a team player and looking out for his best interests. He's a better guard than tackle -- the difference between Smith the left guard and Smith the left tackle is the difference between an All-Pro and an average to above-average player at this stage. Now is the time for Schottenheimer and Smith to agree on a long-term, positional home for their three-time Pro Bowler. \n\"We'll talk about it. You have to show them what your mindset is. At the same time, it's about my success and my career as well as this team's success. That's the biggest thing for me,\" Smith said. \"It's like what's best for the team, but also what's smart for me in my career. ... It's a matter of conversation. I just need to know.\"  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Welcome to UFC's Paramount Era. Starting in 2026, all UFC live events will stream on Paramount+, including the end of pay-per-views, as even numbered UFC events will stream for just the cost of a Paramount+ subscription.This change might mean you've become interested in watching UFC fights for the first time. There are decades of history for the promotion, ranging from the earliest days of a \"wild west\" approach to fight promotion to the current status as a global brand that presents more than 40 events and hundreds of fights every year.With that in mind, it's a huge ask to dig through the more than 8,000 fights that have taken place in the Octagon to find the fights that best exemplify the ideals of a UFC fight, so we took it upon us to create a playlist to introduce you to the sport.Let's take a look at a curated list of the 10 best fights to introduce you to what action inside the Octagon looks like at its most exciting. We kept it to one fight per fighter to give the broadest taste of the sport, and of the fighters who have paved the way to the Paramount+ Era.\nForrest Griffin vs. Stephan Bonnar, The Ultimate Fighter 1 Finale (April 9, 2005)What better place to start the playlist than with the fight UFC CEO Dana White credits with saving the UFC? The Fertittas and White had seen their attempts to grow the UFC stall out when they took a last-ditch shot in the most 2005 way possible: a reality show. \"The Ultimate Fighter\" drew in viewers for the standard reality show drama, but it also allowed those viewers to connect with the type of men who enter into a cage to punch, kick, elbow, knee and twist another's limbs. The whole thing led to the live finale on Spike TV (the same network that aired the weekly episodes) and Griffin and Bonnar meeting in the light heavyweight finals. The two men went to war in a fight that generated a ton of buzz, led to a renewal order for the show on Spike and UFC contracts for both men. While it was briefly trendy for MMA fans to claim the fight wasn't great for lacking high-level techniques, it's a brutal example of the kind of fight that speaks to a primitive part of the brain.\n\nMauricio \"Shogun\" Rua vs. Dan Henderson, UFC 139 (Nov. 19, 2011)UFC signing a deal with FOX was the first domino that fell to produce one of the greatest UFC fights in history. The deal was signed in August, and in early September, UFC announced that the heavyweight championship fight between Junior Dos Santos and Cain Velasquez would headline the first FOX broadcast, moving it from the expected UFC 139 main event. The promotion then announced that Henderson had signed to return to the Octagon and would face Rua in the UFC 139 headliner. What followed was an all-out war that saw momentum swing multiple times, from Henderson nearly scoring a first-round stoppage to Rua mounting and pummelling Henderson to nearly score a late stoppage.\nJon Jones vs. Alexander Gustafsson, UFC 165 (Sept. 21, 2013)Dana White has claimed Jones is the greatest UFC fighter ever. There's certainly a case to be made for Jones in that slot, whether you place him there or not. With only a small handful of exceptions, Jones dominated nearly every opponent in his storied career. One of the men who was able to actually push Jones to the limit was Gustafsson. Gustafsson was brilliant in the early rounds, winning most of the stand-up exchanges and even scoring takedowns. Jones was able to come back in the second half of the fight to eek out a narrow win in the best fight of his career, and one of the best in UFC history.\nRobbie Lawler vs. Rory MacDonald II, UFC 189 (July 11, 2015)The second meeting between Lawler and MacDonald is considered by many to be the best fight in UFC history. Lawler was a beloved fighter for his pure-action style and he found a perfect dance partner in MacDonald. The two had fought in 2013, with Lawler winning a split decision in a solid fight. Less than two years later, with Lawler now the welterweight champion, they battled again in a blood and guts fight that saw both men rocked, cut and continuing to come forward. Lawler vs. MacDonald II is the kind of fight you can't watch without your heart racing and thinking you should watch it again just for the dopamine rush.\nConor McGregor vs. Nate Diaz 1, UFC 196 (March 5, 2016)Check out the full fight now on Paramount+Even if you've never watched a UFC event, you are likely familiar with McGregor. One of the last true breakout UFC superstars, McGregor entered UFC 196 having run through his first seven UFC opponents. In his last fight before the event, McGregor knocked out the legendary Jose Aldo in just 13 seconds to become featherweight champion. A series of events led to venue and card changes before a plan to have McGregor challenge Rafael dos Anjos for the lightweight title, only for dos Anjos to break his foot. McGregor faced replacement opponent Diaz, the winner of Season 5 of The Ultimate Fighter and a fan favorite for his rebellious personality, in McGregor's welterweight debut. McGregor had a solid first round, only for Diaz to shock the world in the second, forcing McGregor to tap out to a rear-naked choke. It's not as \"great\" as the other fights on the list, but the thrill of a shocking upset is a compelling watch in its own way.Cub Swanson vs Doo-ho Choi, UFC 206 (Dec. 10, 2016)It's easy to forget that, at the peak of his career, Swanson defeated the likes of UFC legends Dustin Poirier and Charles Oliveira, among a slew of other talented fighters. Back-to-back losses against Frankie Edgar and Max Holloway knocked Swanson from the ranks of featherweight contenders, but Swanson began to again make the climb as Doo-ho Choi exploded onto the UFC roster with three first-round knockout wins. That all led to a crossroads fight at UFC 206, which Swanson won in an all-action fight to prove he still had plenty in the tank.\nRobert Whittaker vs. Yoel Romero II, UFC 225 (June 9, 2018)Whittaker is another fan favorite fighter, both for his style and his personality. Romero presented a fantastic foil for Whittaker during Whittaker's time as middleweight champion. With an action figure build, which betrayed Romero as he missed weight, thus leaving him unable to win the title at UFC 225, Romero looks like what someone dreams of as a professional fighter. Add in an Olympic silver medal in freestyle wrestling and massive power in his punches and kicks, and Romero is as dangerous as any fighter on any given day. Whittaker managed to navigate all of those dangers against Romero not once, but twice, with their UFC 225 clash as the standout in their rivalry. Romero had to survive Whittaker's clever boxing in the opening rounds before he started to connect with heavy power shots that dropped Whittaker several times. Despite those scary moments, Whittaker survived and took a split decision.\nDustin Poirier vs. Dan Hooker, UFC Fight Night (June 27, 2020)During one of the peak stretches of the COVID-19 pandemic, beloved legend Poirier met a dangerous and rangy fighter in Hooker in the empty UFC Apex. Poirier had lost a shot at the lightweight championship against then-champion Khabib Nurmagomedov and was looking to remain in contention for another shot at the belt against Hooker, who was looking to boost his own resume with a win over a future Hall of Famer. The result was a bloody war that saw Hooker win the early rounds before a gutsy comeback from Poirier over the final stretch.\nWeili Zhang vs. Joanna Jedrzejczyk, UFC 248 (March 7, 2020)Check out the full fight now on Paramount+ Great fights aren't only for men. Since UFC welcomed women to the Octagon in 2013, women have produced a ton of memorable moments and great fights. Arguably, no women's fight has produced the drama, skill and violence of Zhang vs. Jedrzejczyk in 2020. The bell-to-bell action left both women visibly damaged, though it was Jedrzejczyk who ended up with a hematoma on her forehead that remains one of the most striking visuals in MMA history.\nGlover Teixeira vs. Jiri Prochazka, UFC 275 (June 11, 2022)Check out the full fight now on Paramount+Teixeira became one of the great stories of the 2020s when he defeated Jan Blachowicz to win the light heavyweight championship at 42 years old. That was a fantastic moment for one of the sport's most beloved figures. His first title defense came against Prochazka, a unique fighter who combined a samurai mentality with a wide-open attacking style. Prochazka tagged Teixeira with his unorthodox striking throughout the fight, but Teixeira stood tall, landing his own strikes and using takedowns to unleash brutal striking on the ground. Despite the narrative that Prochazka couldn't win the fight if much time was spent on the floor, he only only survived Teixeira's assault, but also finished the fight there, forcing Teixeira to tap to a rear-naked choke with just 28 seconds left in the fight.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 Champions League season will be back in two weeks after six matchdays of the league phase took place from September to December 2025, but the top European leagues aren't going on break in the meantime. Arsenal and Manchester City are ready to fight for another Premier League title while Bayern Munich are once again dominating the Bundesliga standings. Elsewhere, Juventus are getting back to the top of the Serie A standings while Real Madrid seem to have solved their problems. Let's take a look at our weekly power rankings:   1. Arsenal (--)Week after week, I'm more convinced this is going to be the year when they will finally lift a trophy. Mikel Arteta's side have a six-point advantage on Manchester City in the Premier League standings and lead the league phase table in the Champions League. If they don't win at least one of those in the next five months, it will be a failure.  2. Bayern Munich (--) The German Bundesliga will be back this week after the winter break and we can expect Bayern Munich to continue to score, having recorded 55 goals scored in 15 games played so far in the league. Averaging 3.6 goals per game, they have to be considered one of the best teams of the season.  3. Manchester City (--)Despite the home draw against Chelsea over the weekend that slowed down their pursuit of Arsenal, the feeling is that they will continue to show their strong form, while the future of the Spanish manager Pep Guardiola will be a big topic in the coming weeks. This might be the last six months of him at City despite a contract running until 2027, and they have to make the most out of it. \n 4. Barcelona (--)The team coached by Hansi Flick won 2-0 in each of the last four games played in all competitions, showing a big improvement in defense, something that they have always struggled to achieve in the past months. Next up: the Spanish Super Cup.  5. PSG (--) Once the 2025 AFCON is over, PSG will also welcome back Achraf Hakimi, who finally recovered from his injury and will be a big boost for the team coached by Luis Enrique in the coming weeks, when both Ligue 1 and Champions League will enter their key phases. 6. Inter (+1)Inter are performing incredibly well in the past weeks, showing some great football and also winning a lot of games, as it happened over the past weekend against Bologna. It will be another key week as the Nerazzurri will also meet Napoli on Sunday at San Siro for what is likely to be a crucial test for the title race. \n7. Real Madrid (+2)Xabi Alonso's job was in danger a month ago, but the Spanish coach was able to turn things around and adjust it all. Over the weekend, the Blancos won 5-1 against Real Betis and Gonzalo Garcia scored his first hat trick with the team. This is getting interesting. 8. Atletico Madrid (-2)The biggest issue about Diego Simeone's side this season has been the inconsistency of results. Too many times Atletico Madrid had some ups and downs that prevented them from being at the top of the standings and trying to put pressure on both Real Madrid and Barcelona for the title race. I was expecting a bit more from them after last summer. 9. Atalanta (+1)Raffaele Palladino did what he was asked to. He took over Atalanta and quickly changed the situation after a disappointing start under Ivan Juric. The 1-0 win over AS Roma this weekend marked the beginning of a new era as Palladino won against the side coached by Gian Piero Gasperini, the former Atalanta coach who left in the summer of 2025 after a decade at the club. \n10. Liverpool (+1)It's not so much a reflection of their improvement, but after what has happened in recent days with Enzo Maresca's departure, they simply cannot be ranked below Chelsea.11. Chelsea (-3)Ah, here we go again. In my previous rankings, I asked the Chelsea board to stick with Enzo Maresca at least until the end of the season. I guess they didn't read it. \n        \n            \n                Who is Liam Rosenior? Chelsea set to hire Strasbourg coach after Enzo Maresca exit, per report\n                \n                    Pardeep Cattry                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n 12. Olympique Marseille (--)If there is one team that can beat PSG, that's the side coached by Roberto De Zerbi. I won't be surprised if he's on the radar of many clubs this summer or even Manchester United right now.\n13. Newcastle (--)Eddie Howe's side are slowly coming back but this season is not going as we were expecting last summer. Too many ups and downs don't pay off when it comes to the Premier League and this is why they are now in ninth place.  14. Borussia Dortmund (--)The Bundesliga will be back this week and Dortmund will try to close the gap with Bayern Munich, but that's just not going to happen. However, they should focus more on the Champions League's last two games of the league phase as they still have chances to end up in a good spot.  15. Galatasaray (--)After what they have done in the summer, there are high expectations, especially in the Champions League but they might not be over as they are currently looking to sign Italian midfielder Davide Frattesi from Inter in the winter transfer session. If that happens, it will be another signal of their desire to impress. \n 16. Napoli (+1)Their position in this ranking is strictly related to their disappointing Champions League campaign as Antonio Conte's team are performing incredibly well in the Serie A standings despite some big injuries that continue to affect the roster. 17. Juventus (-1)After some good results, the Bianconeri drew 1-1 against Lecce over the weekend, but the cycle under Luciano Spalletti started off well. They should extend his deal beyond the summer and start working with him to rebuild the team. He's the right manager for this club.  18. Bayer Leverkusen (--)I'm not sure what we can expect from them in the second part of the season and the winter break. I'm sure they made the right decision to sack Erik ten Hag and to appoint Kasper Hjulmand, but they need more stability in 2026, after so many changes in the roster and in the coaching staff. \n19. Sporting CP (--)They have been performing well this season, but Porto look unstoppable, with Francesco Farioli's side winning 16 matches, drawing once, and remaining unbeaten in the Portuguese league so far. 20. PSV (+1)They are doing great. In the league: 15 wins, one draw, only one defeat and a 15-point gap on Feyenoord.21. Tottenham (-1)I thought Thomas Frank was the right man to turn things around, but I'm not sure at this point if he can achieve what he hoped for at the club. Both Enzo Maresca and Ruben Amorim were sacked this year, and I'm not surprised if he's next.\n 22. AS Monaco (--)Another challenging season for AS Monaco. The good old days seem really far away but maybe with the right manager this team can still be back at the top. 23. Benfica (--)They found the right manager but I'm not sure he will stay forever. What if Manchester United call Jose Mourinho back this summer?  24. Club Brugge (--)Can they avoid selling their best player to AC Milan this year? I guess not, as their striker Nicolò Tresoldi was at San Siro to watch the Rossoneri facing Hellas Verona. \n 25. Copenaghen (--) I didn't think they could make it for the playoffs of the league phase but their away win against Villarreal will give them a shot. 26. Qarabag (--)They surprised everyone in the opening matches of the league phase but that was it. Not enough to hope to see them again in the playoffs. 27. Eintracht Frankfurt (--)They have conceded 30 goals in 15 Bundesliga matches. With such a record, they can't hope for much more than that. \n 28. Union Saint-Gilloise (--) Their focus now will be on the league as they have no chances to qualify for the play-offs.  29. Athletic Club (--) I was sure they were going to become the surprising side of the league phase. That's right, I was.  30. Villarreal (--)I still can't understand how they can be the most surprising team in LaLiga, currently sitting third behind only Barcelona and Real Madrid, yet at the same time are one of the most disappointing sides in the Champions League.31. Pafos (--)It was amazing to see them playing in the Champions League and really hope to see them again here in the future.  32. Slavia Prague (--) With all due respect, they are not at the level of the other teams, and this is where we were expecting to see them.  33. Olympiacos (--)There were expectations to be good when maybe there shouldn't have been.34. Bodo/Glimt (--) I thought they could do better in Europe this season, especially considering the temperatures at their home games.  35. Ajax (--)By far the biggest disappointment of the season, and there are still a lot of months to go before the end. 36. Kairat (--)I write this every week, but I'm not tired yet: I hope to see them back on the Champions League stage next season. They offer something unique. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 NFL regular season is in the books, and change is already in the air. The offseason is a time of immense turnover, as players switch teams via free agency or trade, teams change their rosters by acquiring them through one of those avenues or in the draft, and plenty of clubs swap out their coaches as they look to improve from one year to the next.We're here today to talk about the latter group of teams. As of Monday afternoon, six NFL teams have fired their coaches. The Tennessee Titans and New York Giants fired Brian Callahan and Brian Daboll during the regular season. The Atlanta Falcons fired Raheem Morris on Sunday night. And on Monday, the Cleveland Browns fired Kevin Stefanski, the Las Vegas Raiders fired Pete Carroll and the Arizona Cardinals fired Jonathan Gannon.In the wake of all of those changes, let's rank the coaching vacancies in order of their desirability.Follow live updates on NFL coaching and GM changes, firings and rumors.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. FalconsThere are a couple of things working against the Falcons here: First and most importantly, there is extreme uncertainty surrounding the quarterback situation. Michael Penix Jr. is coming off yet another knee injury. Kirk Cousins is probably not long for Atlanta given that the Falcons can save $22.5 million by cutting him (or $35 million by designating him as a post-June 1 release). \nThe Falcons also do not have a first-round pick in this year's draft after trading up for James Pearce Jr. in 2025 and are set to enter the offseason over the 2026 salary cap. All that said, Atlanta has the most talent of any team with a head-coaching vacancy. Between Bijan Robinson and Drake London on offense, there is already a baseline level of star talent to build around. Kyle Pitts could be back. The offensive line is solid. The defense slowed down after an incredibly hot start to the year but still finished the year 14th in EPA per play allowed. There is at least a foundation for success on that side of the ball, if you can land on the right defensive mind, whether as the head coach or coordinator. The Falcons also play in the NFC South, which is one of the worst divisions in football.\nThe Falcons are running this search in a strange way, though, with separate consulting firms leading the search for the coach and the general manager. Things could get weird if the GM doesn't have the chance to hire their preferred coach. \n        \n            \n                Falcons coaching candidates: Why Kevin Stefanski tops list, plus two Rams coordinators should be in play\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. GiantsThe Giants won't have the No. 1 pick in the draft like it seemed they would a few weeks ago, but they do have a few things working in their favor.The first is the young talent on offense, and specifically at quarterback with Jaxson Dart, who showed flashes during his rookie season that he can be a strong option for the Giants under center. Malik Nabers and Cam Skattebo are attractive as well, although they'll both be coming off of major injuries. And Andrew Thomas is an elite tackle. \nThen there's the defense, which boasts one of the best fronts in the league -- or should, at least. So long as the Giants have Dexter Lawrence, Brian Burns and Abdul Carter, they should be able to get after it up front. They need to improve on the second and third levels and they definitely need to get better against the run, but there's talent on this side of the ball. A potential issue is the ownership and management situation, where John Mara is sadly in poor health and general manager Joe Schoen is set to return (and lead the coaching search) despite not exactly having distinguished himself in the role.\n        \n            \n                Ranking reported Giants coaching candidates by category: Head coaches, coordinators and more\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. TitansTennessee restructured its front office over the weekend such that Mike Borgonzi will oversee the 53-man roster and lead the coaching search while Chad Brinker will handle the other football operations responsibilities. The Titans had one of the worst rosters and coaching situations in the NFL this season, but they might be set up to make a jump next year.\nCam Ward's overall numbers don't look great, but there were so many flashes of high-level talent when you turn on the film. He was let down by a decrepit supporting cast and has a chance to be much better next year if the Titans improve the talent around him. And they'll have every chance to do so because Tennessee is set to enter the offseason with over $105 million in cap space and the No. 4 pick in the draft. They're not necessarily a candidate to go worst-to-first like the Bears and Patriots did this year, but they definitely have a chance to be a lot better next season if they hit on the right coach and use their budget and draft capital wisely, like those teams did. \n        \n            \n                Renner's 2026 NFL mock draft 6.0: Raiders, Jets land QBs with top two picks as other teams miss out\n                \n                    Mike Renner                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. RaidersThe Raiders are here for four reasons: Brock Bowers, Ashton Jeanty, the No. 1 pick in the draft and $100 million in cap room. (You could say five reasons and include Maxx Crosby, but there are already rumors swirling that the Raiders are finally willing to listen to trade offers for the star edge rusher, so he may not be long for Las Vegas.) There is just not much talent on this team outside of those players. \nThere is a loooong way to go before the Raiders can be remotely competitive, and it doesn't help that they play in the AFC West, which is one of the most competitive divisions in football. Like the Titans, though, they can take a jump next season if they hit on their coach and whichever quarterback they presumably draft with the No. 1 pick, and spend their free-agent money to upgrade the talent level on the roster.One drawback here is the ownership situation, where Mark Davis seems to flail wildly from one plan to the next in quick succession. The Vegas job is not exactly stable, and doesn't come with a lot of job security, as evidenced by all the changes the Raiders have made over the last several years. \n        \n            \n                Raiders coaching candidates after Pete Carroll firing: Tom Brady ties to Patriots, plus fresh faces\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. BrownsThe Browns have a good defense built around Myles Garrett, who is just an inhuman monster coming around the edge. They drafted a pair of star rookies in tight end Harold Fannin Jr. and linebacker Carson Schwesinger. They have multiple first-round picks in this year's draft thanks to last year's Travis Hunter trade. \nWhat the Browns don't have is much other talent on offense (Quinshon Judkins will be coming off a dislocated ankle and fractured fibula), an answer at quarterback or any cap space to solve their various issues. Cleveland is set to begin the offseason more than $12 million over the cap, according to Over the Cap, and it still has the albatross of Deshaun Watson's contract weighing down its books in both 2026 and 2027, at least.The Browns also have an ownership and management situation that is, shall we say, not all that desirable. The Haslam family has run one of the most unstable organizations in the league, and Andrew Berry hasn't exactly put together a great roster. (The combination of the Haslams and Berry was responsible for the disastrous Watson trade.)\n        \n            \n                Browns fire Kevin Stefanski: Here are five potential coaches who could replace him\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. CardinalsArizona lost 14 of its final 15 games this season and looked incredibly listless in doing so. The Cardinals have an uncertain quarterback situation with Kyler Murray seemingly not long for the team, and they really have no viable path to solving that situation this offseason unless it becomes a three-quarterback draft or the Jets decide to pass on someone like Dante Moore (if he enters) or Fernando Mendoza at No. 2 overall. \nArizona is set to have only around $21 million in cap room (and only $9.8 million in effective cap space), per Over the Cap, so it's not like there are a lot of resources here to solve the various roster issues. They do have players like Trey McBride, Michael Wilson, Paris Johnson Jr., Josh Sweat, Budda Baker, Garrett Williams, Walter Nolen and Will Johnson, but there are still a lot of holes here and not that much to build around.\n            ",

The Russian has helped New York on a 6-1-1 run, and after winning the Winter Classic in Miami, he has one or fewer goals in eight games this season, tied for fourth-most in the league.\" Back the Rangers at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Clippers (-102) vs. WarriorsThe Clippers are coming off a bad 146-115 loss to the Celtics on Saturday, but they had a six-game winning streak before that contest, including victories over the Pistons, Lakers and Rockets. The Clippers have rebounded from their awful start to give themselves a chance at competing for an NBA Play-In tournament spot if they keep playing as they have over the last few weeks. The Clippers are just 12-22 this season, but they are home on Monday, and they've gone 5-1 over their last six home games. James Harden and Kawhi Leonard still make a top duo in the league for Los Angeles, and Leonard is averaging 38.8 ppg over his last four contests. The Warriors are 2-3 over their last five road games, and 8-12 away on the season. The model projects the Clippers to win in 64% of simulations, showcasing strong value at near even-money odds. Back the Clippers at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:\nWant more NBA, NHL picks for Monday?You've seen some of the model's Monday best bets.

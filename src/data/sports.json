    "body": "\n        The Cleveland Cavaliers and Los Angeles Clippers have struck an NBA trade deadline blockbuster. The two sides have agreed to a deal that sends Darius Garland and a second-round pick to the Clippers in exchange for James Harden, according ESPN. It's one of the more surprising trades in recent deadline history given the age difference between the two players. Garland, just 26, is 10 years Harden's junior. Cleveland, coming off of a 64-win season and still in the thick of the Eastern Conference playoff race, seemingly didn't need to make a shakeup this significant. Yet the Cavaliers made the deadline stunner in hopes of enhancing their 2026 title chances.There are two likely motivations for this trade on Cleveland's end. The first is durability. Garland has dealt with a toe injury dating back to last postseason. He missed time early in the season, came back and struggled, slowly worked his way back into form, but aggravated the injury and has now been out since Jan. 14. He dealt with a variety of injuries earlier in his career, including a torn meniscus when he was in college.The second motivator is likely financial. Harden and Garland make almost identical salaries this season, but Harden's contract is only partially guaranteed for next season, and given his age, he is unlikely to be a long-term fixture on their books. Garland has two more expensive seasons left on his contract, and he is set to become eligible for a contract extension this offseason. Given the league-wide move away from small guards and Garland's injury history, it's possible that the Cavaliers have simply decided they were ready to move on Garland, but without wanting to sacrifice their chance at competing this season, Cleveland instead turned to an older star guard to pair with Donovan Mitchell.\nHarden has unquestionably been the better of the two players this season, averaging over 25 points and eight assists for the Clippers as he kept them afloat early in the season. He has not scored especially efficiently this season, but he is still an elite generator of team offense. The Clippers scored 118.9 points per 100 possessions with Harden on the floor this season, which is the equivalent to the No. 3 offense in the NBA over the full season., They fell off of a cliff without him.While Harden has defensive vulnerabilities like Garland, he does have two key areas of utility. First, he's a good deal bigger than Garland. Harden is a bulky 6-foot-5 whereas Garland is a skinny 6-foot-1. Harden has used that strength to hold his own against bigger players in the past. He also has very quick hands, which he's used to deflect passes and generate turnovers quite well throughout his career. Cleveland's point guard slot was always going to be a defensive issue, but the Cavaliers recently turned De'Andre Hunter into Dennis Schröder and Keon Ellis, beefing up that perimeter defense perhaps in anticipation of this sort of move.\nThe Clippers end of this deal is more obvious. They just turned a 36-year-old star point guard into a 26-year-old star point guard. The Clippers, built around Harden and the 34-year-old Kawhi Leonard, were the oldest team in the NBA entering this season. The ongoing investigation into Leonard's dealings with Aspiration could alter his time with the Clippers in the near future, so the team badly needed to figure out some sort of new, long-term direction. Garland is a start on that front, and with their books basically clean after the season, they shouldn't have much of an issue paying him for the long haul and putting a team around him and cornerstone big man Ivica Zubac.As a value proposition, this trade is going to raise some eyebrows. Typically, a team trading a young, recent All-Star expects to receive a haul of draft picks back in return. But recent history seems to be pointing in the other direction, especially when it comes to small guards. Trae Young was just traded, essentially, for a salary cap dump with the Washington Wizards. The Memphis Grizzlies have struggled to generate a substantial trade market for Ja Morant. Had Cleveland moved a year or two earlier on Garland, this trade would probably look different.Instead, the Cavaliers may be realizing that they cannot do much better than an older, slightly more productive and durable replacement. Even despite Harden's history of playoff disappointments, the Cavaliers may ultimately decide that he gives them a better chance at winning it all this season than Garland does, so they're considering moving their talented yet injury-prone star now rather than risking the even worse offers players like Young and Morant seemed to generate later.\nIt's an enormous and unconventional risk, one that has a chance to completely revitalize the Clippers in the coming years. But if Harden can overcome his own history to give Cleveland the sort of reliable production in the playoffs that he's been giving the Clippers in the regular season, it might be what it takes to get the Cavaliers back to the Finals.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        One of the top events on the PGA Tour tees off on Thursday as the 2026 WM Phoenix Open unfolds at TPC Scottsdale (Stadium Course). Known for its raucous crowds, the WM Phoenix Open usually draws a great field, and this year is no exception. Scottie Scheffler, Xander Schauffele and Hideki Matsuyama are among the players teeing it up. They'll be joined by Brooks Koepka, who is playing his second event since rejoining the PGA Tour last week at the Farmers Insurance Open.The latest 2026 WM Phoenix Open odds list Scheffler as the +220 favorite (risk $100 to win $220), followed by Schauffele at +1700. Si Woo Kim, Hideki Matsuyama and Cameron Young are all at +2500, with Viktor Hovland, Sam Burns and Ben Griffin all at +3000. Brooks Koepka is +4500 in his second PGA event since returning to the tour. Before locking in any 2026 WM Phoenix Open picks, or making any PGA DFS picks on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, simulated every PGA Tour event 10,000 times and reveals golf betting picks that have a history of being extremely profitable. \nThis same model has also nailed a whopping 16 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- as well as this year's PGA Championship and Open Championship.

He's a golfer to fade this week. The 30-year-old is off to a fast start this season, finishing T11 at the Sony Open, T6 at The American Express and T2 at the Farmers Insurance Open.

He has only played this event twice, but he made the cut both times and finished 36th last year and 28th in 2024. Both times he shot above 70 in the first round, but rallied over the weekend, so if he can get off to a fast start at TPC Scottsdale this week, he'll have a chance to be in the mix on Sunday. See who else to pick here. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $200 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:\nHow to make 2026 WM Phoenix Open picksThe model is also targeting three other longshots of +3000 or longer as top-10 contenders. You can only see the model's picks here. Who will win the 2026 WM Phoenix Open, and which longshots will stun the golfing world?

Kennedy claimed the incident was sparked by him calling Metcalf by his full name. On Shannon Sharpe's \"Nightcap\" podcast, Chad Johnson claimed Kennedy used racial slurs in talking about Metcalf and his mother. \nThat report was picked up by numerous outlets, and Kennedy's attorneys claim the result was \"branding Kennedy as a racist on a national scale and subjecting him to death threats, hate mail, and severe damage to his business reputation.\" Kennedy held a press conference in December to deny those accusations and called on Metcalf to \"correct the record\" and publicly confirm he didn't use racist language. Metcalf declined to speak about the incident after his reinstatement following his suspension. \n\"Defendants have failed to issue any public retractions or corrections acknowledging that Plaintiff Kennedy never used racial slurs or hate speech,\" according to the lawsuit. \"Defendant Metcalf, despite being the alleged source of the false and reckless statements, has refused to issue any public statement clarifying that Plaintiff Kennedy did not use racial slurs, thereby perpetuating the defamatory statements.\"\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Bryce James -- LeBron James' younger son -- hasn't appeared in a game this season for No. 1 Arizona, but that hasn't stopped him from impressing. Speaking to Chancellor Johnson, Wildcats coach Tommy Lloyd confirmed James is redshirting this season.\n\"Bryce has made huge progress,\" Lloyd said. \"He's been with us through the summer and now. The redshirting decision was a long play to give Bryce the most options in his career as his career unfolds. I have a real strong belief that Bryce is gonna be a contributor at Arizona in the near future.\"James, the 324th-ranked player in the 2025 high school recruiting class according to the 247Sports Composite, only turned 18 in June, putting him on the younger side of the class. That played a role in the decision, Lloyd said.\"He's really shown a lot of progress, not only learning our system but just physically maturing,\" Lloyd said. \"One of the things I don't think people understand is he was kind of a year behind, age-wise, his class, and when you're a year behind your natural age class, we know some of these kids are a year other than two older. ... Part of the thinking was, 'Let's slow it down and let Bryce's physical development catch up with his peers,' and it really has.\"\nJames, a shooting guard listed at 6'5\" and 195 pounds, committed to Arizona over Ohio State and Duquesne. Early in the season, Lloyd said a redshirt year was on the table, but a final decision was yet to be made.Arizona (22-0, 9-0 Big 12) had the country's No. 2 recruiting class last year, headlined by five-star prospects Brayden Burries and Koa Peat and four-star guard Dwayne Aristode. Burries leads the team with 15.3 points per game, followed by Peat (14.8) and senior guard Jaden Bradley (13.9). Add in the return of Anthony Dell'Orso and the addition of Ivan Kharchenkov, who had played professionally in Europe, and there was a logjam ahead of James, too.Still, Lloyd has been impressed with James' attitude despite not playing.\n\"We love having Bryce around,\" Lloyd said. \"What I'll say about Bryce is he's a normal person, a normal kid. He's a great teammate. He draws no extra attention to himself. That's all from the outside. Those people do it, but on a day-to-day basis, he's a really valued member of our team, and he's a great young man.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        February 3 is a significant date for the New England Patriots. It was on this day in 2002 that the organization hoisted its first Lombardi Trophy and launched a two-decade dynasty that put the NFL in a chokehold, adding five more Lombardis to the trophy case along the way.Fast forward 24 years, and here they are again, back in the Super Bowl with a chance to add another title to the organization's résumé. This latest run to the big game, however, isn't led by the likes of Tom Brady and Bill Belichick, as those other championship teams were. Instead, it's an entirely new cast of characters with different talents and backgrounds, but the goal remains the same: to become Super Bowl champions.\n        \n            \n                Super Bowl 2026: Ranking every Patriots and Seahawks starter ahead of NFL championship devoid of star power\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDrake Maye wasn't even alive when the franchise won that first Super Bowl, but his team shares plenty of similarities with that championship club of yesteryear, which feels especially noteworthy on this anniversary as the Patriots prepare for another Super Bowl berth.\nThe most glaring similarity, outside of the same logo on the side of their helmets, is, of course, the presence of Mike Vrabel. The former linebacker first arrived in Foxborough in 2001 as a free agent and is now back with the organization in 2025, serving in his first year as head coach.But let's dive a little deeper with Vrabel. He's reaching the Super Bowl in his seventh season overall as a head coach and with his second team. You know who did the same thing back in 2001? Bill Belichick. Moreover, both coaches quickly elevated their organizations, each entering the year with at least 60-1 odds or longer to win the Super Bowl (60-1 in 2001 and 80-1 in 2025).The similarities extend to the roster, too, as both teams were led by second-year quarterbacks. After being the No. 3 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, Maye has surged into an MVP candidate in Year 2 and has the Patriots in Super Bowl LX. Back in 2001, a second-year quarterback by the name of Tom Brady stepped in following an injury to Drew Bledsoe, helped lead New England to Super Bowl XXXVI and began writing his place in NFL history as the greatest of all-time.\nHere are even more nuggets that make these two versions of the Patriots look like mirror images of one another.Stats2001 Patriots2025 PatriotsW-L11-514-3PPG rankSixthSecondOpp PPG rankSixthFourthSecond-year QBTom BradyDrake MayeSeventh-year HCBill BelichickMike VrabelStrength of schedule rankFourth-easiestEasiestBoth teams ranked in the NFL's top 10 in points per game and points per game allowed, and each faced one of the five easiest schedules in the league. Heck, they even played in snowy playoff games -- the infamous \"Tuck Rule\" contest came in a blizzard at Foxboro Stadium against the Las Vegas Raiders in the divisional round, and this year brought a second-half whiteout at Mile High against the Denver Broncos in the AFC Championship Game.Of course, there's one major difference between the 2001 Patriots and the current rendition of New England. That team won it all, and the jury is still out on how the final chapter of this 2025 squad will unfold.\n            ",

Almabayev is scheduled to fight former two-time UFC flyweight champion Brandon Moreno on Feb. 28 in Mexico City. There is no official word yet on what that means for the fight.On Tuesday, Almabayev posted a photo of his right arm in a cast. \"The situation is like this, I got an arm injury two days before our  flight,\" Almabayev wrote, according to Google Translate. \"I don't want to talk about the injury… no  matter how much you [try], I can't change it.\" \n\nThe fight is scheduled to be Almabayev's second UFC main event. Against Moreno, he is scheduled to face one of Mexico's top MMA stars at Arena CDMX in Mexico City. Almabayev (23-3) has won six of seven fights in the promotion. The Kazakh fighter's lone UFC loss was against top contender Manel Kape in Almabyaev's first UFC main event. A win over a former champion like Moreno would do wonders for his potential to fight for the flyweight title.\nMoreno, 32, is 2-2 since 2024 after dropping the flyweight title to Alexandre Pantoja by split decision. He's looking to bounce back from a TKO loss to Tatsuro Taira in December.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Boston Celtics are trading Anfernee Simons and a second-round pick to the Chicago Bulls for Nikola Vučević and a second-round pick, according to ESPN. The deal is the latest in a string of trades the Bulls have made at this year's deadline (follow live updates here), as Chicago has not only added Mike Conley and Jaden Ivey, but taken on money for multiple teams in exchange for draft capital. Boston, meanwhile, addresses its meaningful hole at the center position with a former All-Star that fills in a stylistic gap left behind by Al Horford and Kristaps Porziņģis, and in the process, took a step towards reaching its financial goals.So, how'd these teams do in the deal? Let's grade the trade.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Boston Celtics: BLet's start with the obvious: the Celtics needed center depth. While Neemias Queta has thrived as the starter this season, Luka Garza was not going to cut it in the postseason. Enter, Vučević. While his defensive vulnerabilities have been problematic in the playoffs in the past, he'll likely have an easier time with the Celtics because of their defensive infrastructure and the fact that he'll likely be in a smaller role.He is, critically, a stylistic curveball from Queta. Boston has thrived with shooting centers in the past, and while Garza has been playable for them this season, he's not Al Horford or Kristaps Porziņģis. Vučević is a much more reliable option as a shooting big man, and his presence allows the Celtics to toggle their playing style pretty readily. Queta is a rim-protector, a screener and a rim-roller. While neither he nor Vučević are complete big men, they do different things well and off Boston some needed variety. The duo should complement one another very well, though they'll likely never play together.The deeper implications of this trade, however, are financial. The Celtics entered Tuesday around $12 million above the luxury-tax line. Getting below the line this year would be extremely meaningful to Boston moving forward. The Celtics are a repeater tax team. If they can duck the line this year and next, they'll reset the repeater clock entirely. Considering how punitive the repeater tax is and how pricey keeping this team together (and adding to it) will likely be, resetting that clock is going to mean a ton moving forward.\nThe Celtics didn't do that fully here. They got about halfway home. As of right now, the Celtics are $5.9 million above the tax. Using Simons to clear the first $6 million or so is a start. The next $6 million, however, is much harder. Boston doesn't have bad money to dump. More than half of their roster makes less than $3 million. They could find some savings by trading some of their minimum players and replacing them with pro-rated minimum free agents, but it's hard to imagine them saving $6 million that way. That's why Jusuf Nurkić had been a popular hypothetical Boston center target. Though he makes plenty, the gap between his salary and Vučević's is big enough that the Celtics would have had a pretty straightforward map to ducking the tax afterward. Realistically, there are two paths to doing so now: trading Sam Hauser, or re-trading Vučević.For now, we have no indication that either move is in the offing. Hauser is a beloved, homegrown reserve and Vučević actually addresses a need for them. If the Celtics don't make a follow-up trade, they've at least set themselves up to add another player. The Celtics are now below the first apron, at least. That means they are allowed to sign a free agent who was making more than the non-taxpayer mid-level exception when he was waived, or, in layman's terms, a buyout player. There isn't an obvious target out there now, but with the blockbusters flying left and right, it's entirely possible that some helpful veteran finds himself on the market, and the Celtics could use their newfound flexibility to add that player. Still, the priority should be ducking the tax.Losing Simons stings. Though he started out the year slowly, he was finding his footing in Boston after spending most of his career on Portland teams that weren't true contenders. They'll miss his scoring, but if Jayson Tatum comes back, well, that's an easy replacement. Ultimately the Celtics were unlikely to pay Simons for the long haul, so as much as it stings to lose him from this year's team, it was a price they needed to pay in order to secure a center and start the process of ducking the tax.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Chicago Bulls: B-The broad concept makes sense for Chicago. They're also getting a good second-round pick in the deal (Chicago will reportedly get the most favorable of the Pelicans, Blazers, Knicks and Wolves second-round picks this June). The Bulls are going nowhere this season. Sure, they'll probably earn their obligatory Play-In berth, but their ambitions, for now, don't go much further. So Chicago has wisely decided to use this deadline to act as a financial facilitator, and the team has broadly done well in that role thus far.\nThe draft capital the Bulls have accumulated is small, but it adds up. The real prize so far was their addition of Jaden Ivey in a trade with Minnesota and Detroit earlier Tuesday, but we're not grading that deal here. Overall, this is just a smart use of resources. The Bulls aren't forcing win-now moves and they're not being stingy with tier cash. They're making the most of what they have, and will likely continue to do so with a Coby White trade before the deadline. Good overall work.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Pitchers and catchers are a week away from reporting for duty to camps across Florida and Arizona, yet that doesn't mean Major League Baseball's teams can spend the offseason's final days in relaxation mode. Rather, there are still some notable free agents left on the market, like starters Framber Valdez and Zac Gallen, and still the potential for sizable trades (including Monday's three-team deal that sent Brendan Donovan to the Mariners). With that in mind, CBS Sports has gathered below all of Tuesday's most notable murmurs and moves in one spot for your viewing convenience. D-backs add SantanaThe Diamondbacks, previously slated to use Pavin Smith as their most-days first baseman, have agreed to terms on a one-year deal worth $2 million with veteran Carlos Santana, per 98.7 FM.\nSantana, 40 in early April, split last season between the Guardians and the Cubs. He hit .219/.308/.325 (77 OPS+) with 11 home runs and seven stolen bases. Santana, still considered a high-quality defender at the cold corner, contributed an estimated 1.1 Wins Above Replacement, according to Baseball Reference's calculations.The D-backs had previously been connected to free-agent first baseman Ty France, among others, suggesting they were interested in adding a dance partner to pair with Smith. Santana, for his part, has posted at least a .780 OPS against lefties in three of the past four seasons.\nCardinals would like to add outfielderMuch of the Cardinals' offseason has been defined by subtraction -- they've traded the aforementioned Donovan, first baseman Willson Contreras, third baseman Nolan Arenado, and pitcher Sonny Gray -- yet that doesn't mean St. Louis has no interest in adding ahead of Opening Day. Top baseball operations executive Chaim Bloom told reporters, including the Belleville News-Democrat, that he would like to fortify the outfield depth chart through free agency or a trade.\n\n        \n            \n                How the Cardinals tore it down: Inside Chaim Bloom's rebuild in St. Louis and where they go from here\n                \n                    Dayn Perry                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAs it stands, the Cardinals have an outfield depth chart projected to include Lars Nootbaar, Victor Scott II, Jordan Walker, and Nathan Church. Three of those four batters, or everyone but Walker, is a lefty, suggesting the Cardinals could be in the market for adding another righty to the mix. Some potential free-agent targets, then, include Randal Grichuk and Miguel Andujar.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        With Bill Belichick and Robert Kraft reportedly excluded from this year's Pro Football Hall of Fame induction class, at least one of the three senior finalists will hear his name called when the class is announced during NFL Honors on Thursday night.As this year's coach and contributor finalists, Belichick and Kraft competed for votes with senior finalists Ken Anderson, L.C. Greenwood and Roger Craig. Voters could submit ballots for only three finalists, with automatic induction for anyone who received at least 80% of the vote. If no one reached that threshold, the finalist with the most votes would earn induction.That means this year's class will include either Anderson, Greenwood, Craig or some combination of the three. Each senior finalist has a compelling case for induction.Ken Anderson, QB, Bengals (1971-86)\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Anderson, who will turn 76 later this month, was a former NFL MVP who played his entire 16-year career with the Cincinnati Bengals. A four-time Pro Bowler, Anderson earned praise for his quick, accurate passing, leading the NFL in passing yards and completion percentage multiple times. He thrived alongside Bill Walsh, who served as his quarterbacks coach for five seasons.\nIronically, Anderson faced Walsh's 49ers in his lone Super Bowl appearance. While he accounted for three touchdowns and threw for nearly twice as many yards as Joe Montana, Anderson and the Bengals came up short in a 26-21 loss in Super Bowl XVI.Anderson's magnum opus may have come two weeks earlier against the Chargers in the AFC Championship Game. In the contest that became known as the \"Freezer Bowl,\" his ability to throw tight spirals despite the minus-59 wind chill proved to be the difference in Cincinnati's 27-7 win.\nAnderson's Hall of Fame case has likely suffered from the era he played in, one that featured several notable quarterbacks such as Montana, Dan Fouts (the losing \"Freezer Bowl\" quarterback), Terry Bradshaw, Roger Staubach, Ken Stabler, Bob Griese and Fran Tarkenton. Not winning a Super Bowl hasn't helped, either.\nFor Anderson, though, being a finalist is an honor in itself.\"It would be tremendous,\" Anderson said in a 2022 interview. \"When you grow up in Batavia, Illinois, and you go to Augustana College, it was a stretch to dream about playing in the NFL, let alone someday thinking about being in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. It would be quite an honor. You don't want to look ahead too far, but I'm very humbled to even be in consideration.\"L.C. Greenwood, DE, Steelers (1969-81)\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Greenwood, who passed away in 2013 at age 67, was a major cog in arguably the greatest defense in NFL history. A six-time Pro Bowler, two-time All-Pro and member of the 1970s All-Decade Team, Greenwood anchored the Pittsburgh Steelers' \"Steel Curtain\" defense that helped the franchise win four Super Bowls in a six-year span.Greenwood, who played his entire career alongside Hall of Famer Joe Greene, played an especially big role in Pittsburgh's first two Super Bowl wins. He batted down three of Fran Tarkenton's passes in Super Bowl IX (one of which Greene intercepted) and is unofficially credited with four sacks of Roger Staubach in Super Bowl X.\nSteelers fatigue (10 of his teammates are in the Hall of Fame) and the fact that sacks were not an official individual statistic during his era are likely two of the main reasons Greenwood still hasn't been inducted.\"He gets less credit than he deserves playing next to Joe,\" Jack Ham, a former teammate and Hall of Fame linebacker, recently said. \"No question Joe deserves all the accolades he has received. But L.C. deserves them too.\"\"In my view, when L.C. was playing, he was easily in the top three or four defensive ends during that time,\" added Greene. \"L.C. was a partner of mine on the line for 13 years, and he was a wonderful teammate. ... With L.C. beside me, and us working together, we accomplished some pretty good things together.\"\nRoger Craig, RB, 49ers/Raiders/Vikings (1983-93)\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            With the announcement coming in the Bay Area, it would be fitting if the 65-year-old Craig received his Hall of Fame induction Thursday night. After all, Craig played a key role in the 49ers' dynasty during the 1980s.One of the most versatile running backs in NFL history, Craig became the first player to top 1,000 yards both rushing and receiving in the same season. He scored a Super Bowl-record three touchdowns in the 49ers' 38-16 win over the Miami Dolphins in Super Bowl XIX.\nIn 1988, Craig won Offensive Player of the Year honors after rushing for a career-high 1,504 yards and amassing more than 2,000 all-purpose yards. He became the focal point of the 49ers' offense as injuries limited Montana's availability during the regular season.\nIn that year's Super Bowl, Craig totaled 172 all-purpose yards and became the first running back in Super Bowl history to record 100 receiving yards, catching eight passes for 101 yards. He also made three big catches on the 49ers' 92-yard, game-winning drive as San Francisco recorded its second Super Bowl win over the Bengals.A member of the 1980s All-Decade Team, Craig helped the 49ers win back-to-back Super Bowls the following season before injuries started to slow him down. His decline in production after his age-29 season has likely kept him out of Canton up to this point.While his last four seasons were quiet, what Craig accomplished during his first seven could finally earn him a spot in pro football immortality.\n\"Roger's been waiting for so, so long,\" 49ers owner and CEO Jed York said earlier this week. \"I can't think of anybody who changed the game more than Roger.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\nFor the first three months of the 2025-26 NHL season, the Colorado Avalanche were on a pace that logically was not sustainable. They've proven just that this month.The Avalanche earned at least one point in 38 of their first 40 games this campaign, improving to 31-2-7 with a 5-3 triumph over the Carolina Hurricanes in their first game in January. They've gone 5-7-2 since, losing three of their four contests in Week 17 as their lead in the race for the President's Trophy has shrunk to five points.Five of those nine defeats came at home, where Colorado went 17-0-2 prior to the 2026 calendar year. The club has one more game at Ball Arena -- and overall -- before the NHL begins its 19-day break for the 2026 Winter Olympics.While the Avalanche had a week they'd like to forget, two teams had fantastic seven-day stretches and now are nipping at their heels. The Minnesota Wild and Dallas Stars both won all four of their games and enter Week 18 trailing Colorado in the league standings by only five and six points, respectively.Several other clubs were perfect in Week 17, with the Columbus Blue Jackets, Seattle Kraken and Ottawa Senators all going 3-0-0 and the Tampa Bay Lightning winning both of their contests. Meanwhile, the Montreal Canadiens posted a 3-0-1 record, and the Hurricanes and Boston Bruins each went 2-0-1.Only two squads had a worse time than Colorado last week, as the Florida Panthers suffered four regulation losses to drop out of the top 10 ratings and the New York Rangers were 0-3-0. The Vegas Golden Knights were the only other team that failed to get in the win column, but they earned two points by losing once in overtime and once in a shootout.Each week during the season I'll rank the league's top 10 teams based on both the previous week's performances and overall body of work in 2025-26. I'll also give brief synopsis for each club that explains why they're ranked where they are.Let's dive into the power ratings entering Week 18 of the 2025-26 NHL season and highlight a few of the teams' notable accomplishments.NHL Week 18 power ratings 1. Colorado Avalanche (1-3-0 in Week 17; 36-9-9 overall)The Avalanche began last week with back-to-back road losses against the Senators and Canadiens, giving them setbacks in six of eight contests (2-4-2). They bounced back with a 5-0 triumph over the Detroit Red Wings to break even on their four-game trek but wound up splitting the home-and-home series as they were shut out themselves 2-0 at Ball Arena on Monday. Nathan MacKinnon recorded two goals and an assist in Colorado's lone victory but was kept off the scoresheet in each defeat and is four points behind Edmonton Oilers superstar Connor McDavid, who leads the NHL with 95. Two-time Norris Trophy winner Cale Makar had an even more uneventful week as he failed to record a point. The 27-year-old enters Week 18 with his longest drought since a four-gamer from Jan. 6-11, 2025. Along with Ross Colton, Parker Kelly also scored twice last week and has converted in every other contest over his last eight.2. Tampa Bay Lightning (2-0-0; 35-14-4)Tampa Bay kept rolling in Week 17, cruising past the Winnipeg Jets 4-1 at home before recording an historic 6-5 shootout victory over the Bruins at Raymond James Stadium on Sunday in this season's installment of the NHL Stadium Series. The Lightning overcame a four-goal deficit for the first time in franchise history in that contest as Boston was ahead 5-1 midway through the second period before imploding. It was the eighth consecutive home win for Tampa Bay, which has gone 17-1-1 over its last 19 overall games. Two-time defending Art Ross Trophy winner and three-time overall recipient Nikita Kucherov is riding an eight-game point streak and has landed on the scoresheet in 18 of his last 19 outings. The 32-year-old Russian right wing also is in the midst of a four-game multi-point run as he had a goal and an assist against Winnipeg before netting a tally and setting up three others versus Boston. Meanwhile, defenseman Darren Raddysh's career season continued as the 29-year-old racked up two goals and three assists last week. Raddysh, who enters Week 18 with a four-game goal-scoring streak, already has set personal bests this campaign with 16 tallies, 33 assists and 49 points.3. Dallas Stars (4-0-0; 33-14-9)The Stars began last week with a perfect three-game road trip before ending it with their fifth consecutive overall victory and sixth in seven games, a 4-3 overtime triumph over the Jets. Defenseman Thomas Harley was impressive as he scored with 1:07 remaining in the third period last Tuesday to give Dallas a 4-3 win against the Blues in St. Louis, converted a power-play opportunity in a 3-2 victory over the Utah Mammoth on Saturday and netted the overtime winner versus Winnipeg two days later. Matt Duchene tallied in each game during Dallas' trek, including twice at St. Louis, to extend his goal-scoring streak to four contests and notched a pair of assists against the Jets. Mikko Rantanen got on the scoresheet in all four Week 17 games, collecting a goal and four assists, captain Jamie Benn set up five tallies and Sam Steel and blue-liner Miro Heiskanen recorded four assists apiece.4. Minnesota Wild (4-0-0; 33-14-10)With their four victories in Week 17, the Wild have earned points in six straight games (5-0-1) and eight of their last nine (7-1-1). Three players contributed offensively in all four wins, with Matt Boldy scoring a goal and setting up four others, Joel Eriksson Ek registering three tallies and three assists and defenseman Quinn Hughes amassing a goal and six assists. Boldy is in the midst of a six-game point streak (two goals, six assists), Eriksson Ek has netted a tally in four of his last five outings and Hughes has set up 14 goals during his nine-game assist streak while also converting twice in that span. Kirill Kaprizov has scored four times over his last three contests and posted multi-point performances in seven of his past nine outings.5. Carolina Hurricanes (2-0-1; 34-15-6)Much like the Lightning, the Hurricanes have stormed to the top of the Eastern Conference are riding an eight-game point streak (6-0-2) and have gone 10-1-3 over the last 14 contests. They began last week with a 5-4 triumph over Mammoth -- scoring three times in the final 1:59 of the third period, with captain Jordan Staal netting the winning goal with 30 seconds remaining. Carolina then squandered a three-goal lead in a 4-3 overtime loss to the Washington Capitals and let a two-goal advantage slip away before edging the Los Angeles Kings 3-2 in OT. Defenseman Shayne Gostisbehere collected three goals and three assists in Week 17, while Andrei Svechnikov had two of each. Sebastian Aho appears to have broken out of his slump as he ended his 12-game drought with a tally against the Capitals and converted 1:25 into overtime versus the Kings.6. Buffalo Sabres (3-1-0; 32-18-5)The Sabres just might be for real as they won three of their four games last week. Since their three-game losing streak in early December, they've gone 21-4-1 over their last 26 contests. Alex Lyon has won 11 of his last 12 decisions, setting the franchise record with 10 consecutive victories during the stretch, and defenseman Rasmus Dahlin has landed on the scoresheet in 11 of his last 12 outings. Dahlin matched a career high with five points in a 7-4 triumph over the Toronto Maple Leafs last Tuesday, registering his first NHL hat trick in the contest. Two days later, Alex Tuch recorded his fourth career hat trick as Buffalo defeated Los Angeles 4-1. The 29-year-old right wing hasn't gone back-to-back games without a point since Dec. 20-21, amassing 11 goals and eight assists over his last 20 outings. 7. Montreal Canadiens (3-0-1; 31-17-8)Montreal was less than 13 minutes away from a perfect week as it defeated Vegas, Colorado and Buffalo before taking a 3-2 lead against Minnesota 12 seconds into the third period on Monday. However, the club allowed the tying goal with 12:55 remaining and fell 4-3 in overtime. Defenseman Noah Dobson got on the scoresheet in all four games for the Canadiens, notching a goal and four assists, while Nick Suzuki increased his team-leading point total to 65 with two tallies and four assists. The 26-year-old Suzuki has picked up at least one point in eight of his last nine outings and hasn't been blanked in consecutive contests since Nov. 11 and 13.8. Detroit Red Wings (1-2-1; 33-18-6)The Red Wings fell eight spots in the ratings due to their rough week. They scored a total of one goal in regulation losses to Los Angeles and Colorado, and they were fortunate to earn a point in their shootout defeat against Washington as they tallied twice in the final 1:40 of the third period. Alex DeBrincat was Detroit's top offensive producer in Week 17 as he netted three tallies and set up another. The 28-year-old right wing scored in the team's 2-0 triumph over the Avalanche on Monday to reach the 30-goal plateau for the second straight campaign and fifth time in his nine-season NHL career. 9. Boston Bruins (2-0-1; 32-20-4)The Bruins enter Week 18 with a six-game point streak and have gone 12-2-3 over their last 17 contests. They squandered a two-goal lead before defeating the Nashville Predators 3-2 in overtime last Tuesday and cruised past the Philadelphia Flyers 6-3 but were unable to hold a four-goal advantage in Sunday's Stadium Series matchup against Tampa Bay and fell 6-5 in a shootout. Morgan Geekie collected five points (three goals, two assists) last week while defensemen Charlie McAvoy and Jonathan Aspirot both notched four assists. The 27-year-old Geekie is riding a seven-game point streak during which he has netted seven tallies and set up four others. Meanwhile, McAvoy has racked up a goal and eight assists during his six-game run.10. Pittsburgh Penguins (2-1-0; 28-15-11)Pittsburgh began last week with victories over the Chicago Blackhawks and New York Rangers -- scoring six goals in each triumph -- but dropped a 3-2 decision to the Senators on Monday, ending its six-game winning streak and nine-game point run (7-0-2). Captain Sidney Crosby has a quiet Week 17, recording just one assist, but Anthony Mantha scored three goals and set up two others. Connor Dewar and Noel Acciari each registered two goals and two assists, while Evgeni Malkin had an assist in each of the Penguins' three contests to extend his point streak to six games (three goals, five assists). A two-time Art Ross Trophy winner, the 39-year-old Malkin has landed on the scoresheet in 13 of his last 15 contests, collecting seven goals and 12 assists in that span. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        LONDON -- In principle, Liam Rosenior's approach on Tuesday night made sense. Away to a superior opponent in the EFL Cup semifinal second leg, trailing by a fine margin, you could talk yourself into waiting an hour before really applying yourself on the contest in any meaningful way.In practice, this proved to be an almighty misjudgement from an inexperienced head coach, one that ended in the cruellest fashion for Chelsea, downed by the man they once celebrated as the best on earth, Kai Havertz, slapping the Arsenal badge in delight after rounding Robert Sanchez and slotting home. It was just the wake-up call his old club needed, the moment to draw a bit of impetus out of the Blues. Unfortunately, it came in the 97th minute in a 1-0 win for the Gunners.For too many of those before, Chelsea had been content to let this contest drift vaguely towards a stalemate, in the hope that a set piece might swing the day or, far more unlikely, Arsenal might hand them a route back into the game with an error. There were some intriguing quirks around the edges, a couple of tweaks with and without the ball that asked tricky questions of their hosts. What there was not was any real evidence of a plan to move the ball into the sort of areas where Kepa Arrizabalaga might really be tested.First of all, the mitigations. Rosenior noted post-match that he had been unable to name his team until the afternoon of the game as he sweated on the fitness of his stars. Cole Palmer's minutes had to be carefully managed, and there was extra time to consider. \"He is a gem,\" said Rosenior. \"We have to take care of him and make sure he's right for the whole season. When he came on, his moments were top.\"\nRosenior revealed after the game that both Pedro Neto and Reece James had been laid low with small knocks while he was glowing in his praise of Estevao, who had been absent on compassionate grounds over the weekend but flew back from Brazil. That is four of the players most likely to deliver something from nothing, none of them seeing the pitch until an hour had been played.Those are enough selection headaches for an experienced head coach. Rosenior is not that. Arteta had tried and failed at his last four semifinals. His opponent's experience of knockout ties doesn't extend far beyond Conference League qualifiers, a couple of games in the FA Cup and Coupe de France and that trip to Napoli where the stakes only amounted to saving themselves two more matches. If Rosenior did get this wrong, well, he is early enough in his managerial career to learn from it.It is also one thing to say that Chelsea should have had a go at Arsenal, another for that to have translated into any meaningful issues for the best defense on the planet. When William Saliba is this imperious, there's no getting past him. Certainly not when you've started out with a five-man defense and Liam Delap as a quasi right winger, one whose most meaningful contributions came in the shoving matches with Piero Hincapie. Enzo Fernandez offered only a little more off the left flank, too many attacks coming to a juddering halt when he concluded that the best approach was to swing from range.\nThere is keeping yourself in the tie, and there is wasting your own time. In the first half in particular, Chelsea's build-up was agonizingly slow, their speed of build-up barely any quicker than an Arsenal side that could use the clock as their friend. Even when holding your stars in reserve, you might as well try to get the ball up to the other guys with any sense of urgency.\"You can come away from home, press all over the pitch man for man and you could go 2-0 up or you could go 2-0 down,\" said Rosenior. There are, however, levels between chucking your team forward in pursuit of the ball and this meandering to the hour mark. You don't have to go full gegenpressing to register more than one ball recovery in the attacking third as Chelsea did. It is not a cavalier approach to build up to pass the ball forward more than 27% of the time. At no stage were Arsenal drawn forward in a way that might open up avenues for the counter. The first half ended on three shots to three, 0.18 xG to 0.16 but at least the hosts had a few nearly moments with Gabriel's passes over the top to Gabriel Martinelli and Eberechi Eze. The team pushing for a stalemate were the one who would be eliminated by such a scenario.\nIn keeping it tight, Rosenior might have thought there were hang-ups to play on. Instead, he gave Arsenal the chance to ride through some trickier earlier moments, Gabriel's struggling to work the ball past the Chelsea press with short passes -- though there were some dangerous clips over the top -- and Hincapie's occasionally lax sense early on of where the danger was. These were vulnerabilities to examine further but instead time was afforded for Arsenal's outstanding defenders to ease themselves into the game. It seemed that one of the leading considerations in Chelsea's strategy was an attempt to prey on Arsenal's nerves and see if the Emirates Stadium might get on their players' backs. At home to one of their leading rivals. With Wembley in sight. The Gunners' fanbase might have a reputation for irascibility and irrationality but not insanity. \"I felt that the psychological aspect of the tie was very important. I felt in the stadium as well, 60 minutes, I bring on Cole and Estevao, the game opens up and we have moments in and around the box. I think there was a feeling in the stadium that this tie could turn.,\" Rosenior said.\nMikel Arteta knows this crowd a little better.\"They brought so much energy and belief to the team in different moments,\" he said of his supporters. \"They were great and it wasn't easy today because it was a late kick-off, windy, rainy, cold and they responded. The energy was very good from the beginning. I sensed it was different and they are on board.\"The Emirates Stadium has seen Arsenal deal with bigger threats than Estevao and Palmer, talented though both are. If anyone was struggling with the psychological aspect of the tie, it seemed to be Chelsea. Neither side were angelic on the discipline front but the Blues' 12 fouls had a particular quality of slowing the game down. So did the two minutes and change wasted when Joao Pedro and Wesley Fofana thought they'd build a mini-wall in front of Arrizabalaga as Palmer stood over a free kick. It was an awful lot of time wasted for a shot that slammed straight into the wall.Rosenior was keen to dismiss criticism of his tactics as a view in \"hindsight\" to what had happened but it was clear in the midst of this game that the great charge promised by those changes never really came. In the 25 minutes that followed, Chelsea found themselves with a smidge more total touches and notably fewer in the final third. They were hemmed in, baited into the sort of long balls that Saliba and Gabriel love to mop up. The ball came to Palmer and Estevao when they went to get it, not when Chelsea found space between the lines.\nOn a more basic level, Chelsea set Arsenal a clear task: hold firm for half an hour. When Declan Rice stuck out one of those telescopic legs to snare possession from Palmer, you knew this was a challenge that Arsenal were up for.\"Going into the game today, we knew we had the lead in the tie,\" Rice told CBS Sports after the game. \"We didn't want to put any pressure on ourselves ... Today wasn't just about playing nice football, it was about heart, desire and how much you want to win a game of football.\"Not for the first time in their recent meetings, Chelsea looked like the side who seemed to grasp the specifics of the game altogether more loosely than Arsenal. There was little to love about Arteta's side, who were prepared to brawl their way to the finish line if that was what was required, but this wasn't a game to earn admiration. It was the day to earn a berth in a final, and that placed very different demands on Arsenal than it did Chelsea.\nRosenior might have known how he wanted his team to deal with those, but it is quite another thing to execute a plan that ensures they can actually do so.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 UEFA Women's Champions League league phase will reach its dramatic conclusion on Wednesday as all 18 teams will compete in nine simultaneous fixtures to settle the final standings. The first-ever league phase of the competition has delivered plenty of dramatic moments and rang in the new era with excitement for future iterations. Only 10 teams secured a spot in the next rounds, but there are still scenarios at play. Matchday 6 promises plenty of high stakes with four direct quarterfinal spots and two knockout phase playoff berths still undecided. Champions League giants OL Lyonnes and FC Barcelona are among the 10 teams who clinched a spot in the next round, alongside current title-holders Arsenal. Now it's about final positioning and any advantages that come with it. Up for grabs remain two spots, with Atletico Madrid and OH Leuven currently in those spots:Here's how to watch the final matchday and what to know:Matchday 6 scheduleWednesday, Dec. 17All times EasternJuventus vs. Real Madrid, 3 p.m. on Paramount+PSG vs. Benfica, 3 p.m. on Paramount+ and CBS Sports NetworkRoma vs. St. Polten, 3 p.m. on Paramount+Bayern vs. Valerenga, 3 p.m. on Paramount+FC Twente vs. Real Madrid, 3 p.m. on Paramount+OH Leuven vs. Arsenal, 3 p.m. on Paramount+Paris FC vs. Barcelona, 3 p.m. on Paramount+Lyonnes vs. Atletico Madrid, 3 p.m. on Paramount+      Wolfsburg vs. Chelsea, 3 p.m. on Paramount+StandingsTop four advance to quarterfinals, and spots 5-12 enter the knockout phase playoffs.\n1. Barcelona, 13 points (+15 GD)2. Lyon, 13 points (+9 GD)3. Chelsea, 11 points (+16 GD)4. Juventus, 10 points (+6 GD)5. Real Madrid, 10 points, (+6 GD)6. Bayern Munich, 10 points, (-2 GD)7. Wolfsburg, 9 points (+4 GD)8. Arsenal, 9 points (+2 GD)9. Man United, 9 points (-3 GD)10. Paris FC, 8 points (-1 GD)11. Atletico Madrid, 7 points, (+8 GD)12. OH Leuven, 6 points (-2 GD)13. Valerenga, 4 points (-2 GD)14. Twente, 2 points (-6 GD)15. Benfica, 1 point (-7 GD)16. PSG, 1 point (-8 GD)17. Roma, 1 point (-15 GD)18. St. Polten, 1 point (-20 GD)Who will be the top four?The most sought after prize on Wednesday will be a top-four finish. A direct bye to the quarterfinal bypasses the knockout phase playoffs entirely, and if you're a Champions League contender, the most coveted spot at the moment. Not a single one of the quarterfinal spots has been locked down, adding to the high stakes to round out the league phase. FC Barcelona are on top of the league phase table, with OL Lyonnes just behind them in second place. Both are level on total points, with goal differential the divider between them, and each are in the best position to advance as quarterfinalists. \nBeyond the top two teams, it's a multi-club affair for the remaining two quarterfinal slots. Chelsea FC, Juventus, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Wolfsburg, and Arsenal each have opportunities to qualify for the quarterfinal round. Must-win scenariosFurther down the table means a fight for survival. Teams who clinch 11th and 12th place spots will get the honor of advancing into the knockout phase. There are three teams that face potentially must-win scenarios on the final matchday, and perhaps with the right combo of luck and results elsewhere, a few teams could make some Champions League memories. Atletico Madrid are in 11th on the table and have the most comfortable position heading into matchday 6 but face the toughest task if they're to advance into the knockout phase playoff. They'll go up against OL Lyonnes, the winningest Champions League team of all time, and could make a bit of history if they do the impossible. A point could be just enough to seal a place in the next round, but a loss opens the door to others.\nDebutants OH Leuven are in 12th place, and the Belgians are the underdogs of the tournament. They're also up against a big challenge as they take on reigning title winners Arsenal. Valerenga are in 13th place, and the Norwegians are clinging to hope as they go away to Bayern Munich and need other results to go their way.What's next?After the table is finalized with all 12 teams in place, there will be a knockout phase draw to determine the next chapter of the tournament. The draw will take place on Thursday, Dec. 18, as the competition prepares to close out the calendar year. The knockout phase for the 2025-26 season begins in February (11-12, 18-19), and quarterfinals in March (24-25) and April (1-2). Following the semifinals in late April and early May, the final two teams will compete for the ultimate title in Oslo, Norway, on May 23 2026 at Ullevaal Stadion.\n            ",

New Ole Miss coach Pete Golding is expected hire Wilson as an assistant coach, sources tell CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz and Chris Hummer.During a meeting on Tuesday, Wilson informed LSU players and staff that he will be joining the Rebels after the Tigers' matchup against Houston in the Texas Bowl on Dec. 27. After Brian Kelly was fired, Wilson was elevated to the role of interim coach and led the team to a 2-2 record with wins over Arkansas and Western Kentucky.While this may be a new gig for Wilson, there is plenty of familiarity with both Golding and Ole Miss. After landing the UTSA job in 2016, one of the first hires made was bringing in Wilson to be his defensive coordinator. Roughly a decade earlier, Wilson served as the running backs at special teams coach for Ole Miss from 2005-07.Wilson, 52, started his coaching career back in 1996 as a graduate assistant at Nicholls State, his alma mater. Wilson then worked his way up the ranks of Louisiana high school football before joining the Ole Miss coaching staff in 2005. He also made stops at Southern Miss, Tennessee and LSU before getting hired by UTSA.\nIn his four years with the Roadrunners, Wilson's record was 19-29 with one bowl appearance. UTSA fired Wilson following the 2019 season, and he spent the next two years as the coach at McNeese State where he went 7-11.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        On Tuesday evening at Unrivaled media day, league co-founder Napheesa Collier spoke virtually to reporters for the first time since her end-of-season exit interview with the Minnesota Lynx, when she delivered a scathing pre-written opening statement calling out WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert for her dismissive attitude toward players and saying that the WNBA had \"the worst leadership in the world.\"Those comments, given in the wake of the Lynx's semifinal loss to the Phoenix Mercury in the playoffs, went viral and prompted a widespread discussion about WNBA officiating, the CBA negotiations and Engelbert's future as commissioner of the league.\"I definitely wasn't expecting it to blow up the way that it did,\" Collier told CBS Sports when asked about the reaction to her statement. \"I knew people in our community obviously would see it, but I definitely didn't know that I was going to gain the traction that it did.\" When asked whether her opinion of leadership had changed in the past couple of months, especially as CBA negotiations have heated up, Collier said it had not. \n\"I mean, nothing has changed since then, but I feel really confident in our PA and where we are internally,\" Collier said. \"The conversation has been had now. People are seeing, I think, that change needs to be had. It's coming from so many different directions that so many people feel this way. And I think we're just really excited for the future and what that has to hold, and especially with all these different leagues popping up, Unrivaled, our CBA negotiations, the future just seems so bright. I feel good about it.\"The current WNBA CBA was scheduled to expire on Oct. 30, but the WNBA and WNBPA have agreed to two extensions, with the most recent one extending the CBA to Jan. 9. The second season of Unrivaled, a 3-on-3 league founded by Collier and fellow WNBA star Breanna Stewart, tips off on Jan. 5 and lasts until March. Since many WNBA players participate in Unrivaled and the entire league is based in Miami, Unrivaled is expected to be the site of a lot of CBA discussions and, if and when the new CBA gets signed, a hub of WNBA free agency action. Last season, Unrivaled was the site of a conversation between Engelbert and Collier that Collier made public in her September statement.\nAt Unrivaled this past February, I sat across from Cathy and asked how she planned to address the officiating issues in our league. Her response was, 'Well, only the losers complain about the refs.' I also asked how she planned to fix the fact that players like Caitlin, Angel and Paige, who are clearly driving massive revenue for the league, are making so little for their first four years. Her response was, 'Caitlin should be grateful she makes $16 million off the court because without the platform the WNBA gives her, she wouldn't make anything.'In that same conversation, she told me 'players should be on their knees thanking their lucky stars for the media rights deal that I got them.' That's the mentality driving our league from the top. We go to battle every day to protect a shield that doesn't value us. The league believes it succeeds despite its players, not because of them. Engelbert denied making those comments about Clark and said she was \"disheartened by how Napheesa characterized our conversation.\" The two parties were supposed to meet in person after the WNBA playoffs, but Collier canceled that meeting after Engelbert's denial. The biggest contention in the CBA negotiations is over revenue sharing and salaries. Players want to move this CBA from a model with fixed salaries and salary caps that increase by a pre-determined percentage each year to a model based revenue sharing that allows salaries to grow in real time with the business. The WNBA has included revenue sharing in its recent proposals, and is offering a salary cap of $5 million, up from $1.5 million currently, and maximum salaries above $1 million. But due to the limitations the WNBA is placing on what can be included in the revenue share, players would still get less than 15 percent of league revenue. The Athletic reported this week that the WNBPA's most recent proposal is seeking closer to 30% of league revenue. So the two sides remain far apart as the new year approaches.\n        \n            \n                WNBA CBA talks: How WNBPA's proposal to create developmental roster spots would benefit players and teams\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nCollier sounded optimistic on Tuesday night, though, especially when asked about the unity of the players throughout this fight.\"I think it's been amazing. Just the player buy in, the player participation, the unity in that we all feel like we're in lockstep with what we want, what we're willing to do to get there,\" Collier said. \"I don't think there's fatigue. Obviously, there's frustrations in that both sides are trying to get what they want, but I think we still have that fire within us and that we're willing to do what it takes, and we're going to do whatever it takes to get what we think we deserve.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Saturday felt like a significant moment in NBA Cup history. San Antonio's upset over Oklahoma City didn't just punch a ticket to the tournament final. It was a message to the rest of the sport. The Spurs are no longer just a young team on the rise. They're here, now, ready to compete with any team in the league. And after taking down the Western Conference favorite on Saturday, they'll get their shot at the Eastern Conference favorite on Tuesday against the KnicksThe Knicks took the quieter path to the final. They didn't have to slay Luka Dončić and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander to get here. But New York has waited 52 years for a pro basketball championship of any kind. This isn't the one they've spent five decades waiting for, but you can bet the Knicks still want to bring this trophy back home to New York as NBA Cup champions, and they, too, want to make a statement. If you can't beat the champ, beating the team that beat the champ is the next best thing.Bet Spurs vs. Knicks at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:So let's dig in on Tuesday's NBA Cup final and make some best bets for the marquee game of the regular season thus far.\nNew York Knicks vs. San Antonio SpursTime: 8:30 p.m. ET | Date: Tuesday, Dec. 16Location: T-Mobile Arena -- Las VegasLive stream: Amazon Prime VideoOdds (via FanDuel): NYK -136 | SA +116 | O/U: 232.5\nThere isn't much separating the Knicks and Spurs at this point. They have the same record (18-7). New York's net rating is meaningfully higher, but that makes sense when you consider Victor Wembanyama's lengthy absence. The Spurs with Wembanyama are roughly even with the Knicks when Jalen Brunson plays. They haven't played this season, so there's no template here. We're just betting on styles here. San Antonio allows the second-most mid-range shots in the NBA, and the sixth-highest mid-range field goal percentage. That sort of aggressive drop-coverage can be very problematic against Jalen Brunson, specifically. He loves walking into mid-range jumpers as bigs hang near the basket, and in a big game, he's going to be willing to take and make as many of those shots as it takes. In a game this even, that little matchup advantage gives New York the slimmest of edges. The Pick: Knicks -2.5It's a simple pick, but I almost always lean toward the under in single-elimination games. Game 7s almost always see low scores, so the bet here is that the players start out tight and miss some early shots. Remember, most of these Spurs are young and reasonably inexperienced in big-game settings. The Knicks aren't, but this is also one of the NBA's slowest teams, and should therefore be eager to turn this into a half-court slugfest rather than a track meet with the younger, faster Spurs. The Pick: Under 232.5\nWe covered the sort of shots San Antonio gives up. What about the Knicks? They're near the top of the league in 3-pointers allowed, specifically out of the left corner. Why does this matter? Because Harrison Barnes takes the second-most left corner 3s per game in the entire NBA, and he's made over 47% of them this season. You're paying a big vig here, but I think it's worth it. The Pick: Barnes Over 1.5 3-pointers (-190)\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NBA Cup has now been narrowed down to two teams, with the New York Knicks and San Antonio Spurs set to meet in the championship game on Tuesday night in Las Vegas. The Knicks beat the Orlando Magic in the semifinals to reach the title game, while the Spurs ended the Oklahoma City Thunder's 16-game win streak to advance.Victor Wembanyama made an emphatic return after missing almost a month with a calf sprain, putting up 22 points, nine rebounds, two blocks and two assists in the win. He came off the bench for the Spurs, as they're working him back in cautiously coming back from an injury. Though he only played 20 minutes, he was incredibly efficient, shooting 54% from the floor.Wembanyama and the Spurs will now take on a Knicks team that has gone 9-1 in their last 10 games. The two teams will face off in Las Vegas for the championship game, and in addition to having the title of 2025 NBA Cup winner attached to their names, there's also a large sum of prize money on the line.The winning team of the title game will take home $530,933 per player. That's a modest increase from the $500,000 per player during the inaugural event in 2023. While $530K is a drop in the bucket for players like Jalen Brunson, who is making over $34 million this season, or Karl-Anthony Towns whose contract is up to $54 million this season alone, for guys lower on the totem pole, that's a significant sum.For second-year player Ariel Hukporti, who was a second-round draft pick in 2024, he'll get about a third of what his yearly salary is ($1,955,377) if the Knicks win. It's even more lucrative for two-way players. While two-way players only get half of what those on standard contracts do, Kyle Mangas, David Jones-Garcia, Harrison Ingram, Kevin McCullar Jr., Trey Jemison and Tosan Evbuomwan will all earn roughly $265,466 if their team wins. That's almost half of the standard two-way contract of $636,435.\nEven for the losing team there's plenty of money to be made. The team that loses on Tuesday will earn $212,373 per player. That's still a ton of money for the guys on smaller contracts. Even for the bigger players, it's extra money that they otherwise would not have made, and we've heard guys in the past be motivated by the prospect of earning extra dough.After the Magic advanced to the semifinals, which earned each player $106,187, Desmond Bane noted that he was appreciative of the extra cash after just being fined $35,000 by the league for unsportsmanlike conduct.\"That's huge, man. I just lost $35,000. I gotta go get it back somehow,\" Bane said after the win. \"But I'm excited. Great opportunity for us to play some meaningful basketball early in the season.\"\nAside from the monetary motivation, though, we've seen the league's attempt to bring excitement to the early part of the NBA calendar work.

He's projected to find the end zone, while JSU quarterback, Caden Creel, is forecasted to account for two total touchdowns of his own.As for Troy, its style of play is conducive to quick scoring as it ranks in the bottom seven in FBS in both rushing offense and yards per rush. Thus, it leans on the passing game, and it is facing a defense which does not travel. Five of the six highest point totals that Jacksonville State has allowed have come away from its home stadium.

    "body": "\n        The Golden State Warriors have gone 4-6 in their last 10 games, and are now under .500 after a demoralizing 136-131 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers on Sunday. Stephen Curry poured in 48 points and yet it still wasn't enough to beat a Blazers team that had lost six of seven entering that matchup.The loss puts the Warriors (13-14) further behind in the Western Conference standings, as they sit eighth with 4.5 games separating them and the sixth-placed Minnesota Timberwolves. With the team struggling, fans are not only airing their grievances on social media, but taking it to the top of the ladder. \n        \n            \n                NBA Hater Report: Paolo Banchero's blemish is getting bigger; Stephen Curry can't save Warriors\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nJustin Dutari, a 27-year-old fan from Panama, emailed team owner Joe Lacob about his frustrations with the team. In speaking with SF Gate, Dutari said he searched to find Lacob's email, and shot him a message.\"Please do something about this team,\" Dutari's email said. \"What [does] Steph need to do every night to win? Drop 50 points? Team is [in] need of a real second option. Jimmy [Butler's] tools are being underutilized because he is playing as a power forward due to the small position players. We have no true center. I am so frustrated.\"To Dutari's surprise, Lacob replied within two minutes.\n\"You can't be as frustrated as me,\" Lacob wrote in response. \"I am working on it. It's complicated. Style of play. Coaches desires regarding players. League trends. Jimmy is not the problem.\"It's not every day a team owner responds to a fan's email with actual sincerity. And while he only called out Butler by name and said his play has not been the problem, it doesn't take a genius to guess who Lacob is referencing with his \"coaches desires regarding players\" line. The Warriors have had a tumultuous relationship with Jonathan Kuminga for quite some time, and a contract standoff this past summer only heightened things. \n        \n            \n                Warriors and Jonathan Kuminga eye needed breakup, but they still have to wait another month\n                \n                    John Gonzalez                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThrough the first 12 games of the season, it looked like things had been smoothed over between Kuminga and Golden State's coaching staff. He started every game, was averaging nearly 15 points and while the Warriors only went .500 during that stretch, it appeared as though Kuminga found his place in Steve Kerr's lineup.Since then, Kuminga's registered more DNP-CD's than games played and could find himself once again the subject of trade rumors before the Feb. 5 deadline. Trading Kuminga, though, isn't a cure all for the Warriors, unless they're getting someone like Giannis Antetokounmpo in return. That's no guarantee, but it's clear that change has to happen if Golden State wants to be more than just a first-round exit, regardless of how well Curry is playing.\nPerhaps Lacob will take Dutari's words and be more aggressive on the trade market as the deadline approaches. Until then, the Warriors will have to hope they can find a temporary solution to stay afloat in the gauntlet that is the Western Conference.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Miami Dolphins were eliminated from playoff contention on Monday night, as they were defeated by Aaron Rodgers and the Pittsburgh Steelers, 28-15. The Dolphins entered this prime-time matchup riding a four-game winning streak, but were simply beat down by a better team. The status of starting quarterback Tua Tagovailoa is again being questioned, as he completed 22 of 28 passes for 253 yards, two touchdowns and an interception on Monday night. The box score doesn't tell the entire story. Tagovailoa's two passing touchdowns came in the fourth quarter when Miami was already trailing by double digits, and the Dolphins went a putrid 2 of 8 on third downs.Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel was asked by reporters on Tuesday if he was considering a quarterback change. McDaniel confirmed he was.  \"Well I think the quarterback play last night was not good enough, and so for me, everything is on the table,\" McDaniel said.Who would McDaniel start if he were to bench Tagovailoa?\n\"Well I think that we are in the process of game-planning for the Cincinnati Bengals, so in that process, we are trying to determine who will give us the best chance to win and I'll probably give you more clarity on that tomorrow, as we are 14 hours removed from the game,\" McDaniel responded. The Dolphins have two other quarterbacks on roster: Former No. 2 overall pick Zach Wilson and rookie Quinn Ewers. If Tagovailoa were to be benched, it may be Wilson who is handed the keys to the offense, as Ewers was the designated QB3 on Monday night.In 14 games this season, Tagovailoa has completed 67.7% of his passes for 2,660 yards, 20 touchdowns and a league-leading 15 interceptions, which also marks a career high. The former Pro Bowler has appeared to have regressed this season. In 2022, Tagovailoa led the NFL in yards per attempt and passer rating. The following year, he led the NFL in passing yards with 4,624. That led to him signing a four-year, $212.4 million extension with $167 million in guarantees in July 2024. \nThe Dolphins cannot easily move on from Tagovailoa if they choose to do so this offseason. The former No. 5 overall pick is signed through 2028, and carries a $56.4 million cap hit in 2026. Still, it's possible this week could mark the end of the Tagovailoa era in Miami. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        When the dust settled on the first round of the 2024 College Football Playoff, critics were ready to throw out the entire 12-team system. SMU got shellacked by Penn State, 38-10. Tennessee was outclassed against Ohio State, 42-17. In fact, first round games in the last CFP were decided by an average of 19.3 points. The nominal closest was a 10-point win by Notre Dame against Indiana. The Fighting Irish were up 24-3 at one point as the Hoosiers pulled close in garbage time. That first weekend was disappointing enough that many dismissed the entire size and structure of the field. However, don't fall into believing that's an inevitability of the system. The 2025 bracket will not suffer that same fate. The biggest reason for the change is simple: They fixed the bracket. Last year, conference champions were guaranteed a first-round bye. Because of that, the 5-seed and 6-seed in the field were actually No. 3 and 4 in the country. A first-round game between Texas and Clemson positioned No. 3 against No. 16. \n\n        \n            \n                Ranking the 25 best players in the College Football Playoff: Ohio State, Miami standouts lead the way\n                \n                    Blake Brockermeyer                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThat dynamic isn't completely gone, but it will improve dramatically with the matchups on deck. In the first round of the 2025 playoff, there's a heavyweight battle between No. 7 Texas A&M and No. 10 Miami at Kyle Field, two teams that flashed serious national championship upside. Then, No. 8 Oklahoma and No. 9 Alabama rematch their game from November, when the Sooners forced three turnovers to eke out a two-point victory in Tuscaloosa. James Madison will likely find itself in rough waters against Oregon, but the SP+ ratings believe the game stays within two touchdowns. And then, there's a fascinating rematch between a Tulane squad set to lose its staff with an Ole Miss team going through transition after the departure of Lane Kiffin to LSU. The first game featured transfer quarterback Jake Retzlaff making his second start and having a miserable game. The staff has figured out many more effective ways to use him since then. Granted, there's a good chance that at least one of the Group of Six matchups turns into a major blowout. Earlier this season, Ole Miss smacked Tulane 45-10. However, both the Dukes and Green Wave are far more fully formed than they were in September. \nAnd then, the two Power Four matchups have major implications. Texas A&M vs. Miami features two of the best trench teams in the entire College Football Playoff. Oklahoma is one of the nation's best defenses, while Alabama boasts more recruiting talent than anyone else. Neither game has the makings of a blowout; both teams are both too good and too flawed for that. It's easy to believe that the first round of the playoff is just doomed after seeing the lows of last season. But really, there's plenty of reasons to believe that many of the biggest issues were unique to a single season. More than any other, the biggest reason for the unbalanced first round last season resided in Columbus, Ohio. Ohio State frankly ruined the structure of the bracket after its head-scratching loss to Michigan last season. The most talented team in the country fell to the No. 8 seed because of its own indefensible stumbles. There isn't any such case in 2025. \nAnd really, it's harder than ever to create the kind of superteams that defined the late four-team playoff era because of NIL and the transfer portal. Following the 2022 season, the SP+ gap between the No. 5 and 10 teams in the country was nine points. This year, it's fewer than four points. The upper middle class of the sport is rising. Games are only getting more competitive as a result. When the 2025 College Football Playoff kicks off on Friday, Alabama and Oklahoma will provide a close, physical matchup. Texas A&M and Miami will feature national-caliber quarterbacks and playmakers. Ole Miss and Tulane each boast dynamic quarterbacks. Both James Madison and Oregon are incredibly well coached, even if multiple coaches on each staff are heading to new pastures very soon. There were low moments of the first 12-team College Football Playoff last year, but observers need to be patient. Every year is unique, and the flaws of a given year don't necessarily carry over to the next one. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        USC quarterback Jayden Maiava will bypass the 2026 NFL Draft and instead return to school next season, the team announced Tuesday. The Trojans have \"re-signed\" several players in recent days, with Maiava and running back Waymond Jordan among the most important as the program looks ahead to Year 5 under coach Lincoln Riley. With the Alamo Bowl against TCU ahead, Maiava has had an impressive 2025 season, throwing for 3,431 yards and 23 touchdowns to just eight interceptions with six rushing touchdowns while providing stability at the position in his first year as the Trojans' full-time starter. \nMaiava began last season as the backup to Miller Moss before being inserted into the starting lineup for the final three games of the regular season and the Las Vegas Bowl win over Texas A&M. In the 35-31 bowl victory, Maiava impressed with 295 yards passing and four touchdowns.By starting Maiava and benching Moss -- who went on to transfer to Louisville -- Riley was taking a risk. If he didn't play the UNLV transfer down the stretch of the 2024 season, he ran the risk of Maiava walking away before he started in a single game. Riley's gamble paid off, and Maiava will enter next season as USC's undisputed starter -- and potentially one of the best quarterbacks in the country.\nUSC is set at quarterback entering 2026While USC can comfortably say Maiava is the undisputed starter heading into next season, his return logically takes the Trojans out of the transfer market for a starting-caliber quarterback. There have been multiple quarterbacks who have announced their intentions to enter the transfer portal, including Cincinnati's Brendan Sorsby and Florida's DJ Lagway. While Riley has used the transfer quarterback market to his advantage throughout his career (see Maiava, Caleb Williams, Jalen Hurts, etc.), it would be surprising to see the Trojans make a splash at that position this time around.\n        \n            \n                College football's transfer portal just hit dizzying speeds: What you need to know about big QB shakeup\n                \n                    Chris Hummer                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nPart of the reason is the presence of Husan Longstreet, USC's prized quarterback recruit from the 2025 cycle. Longstreet, rated a five-star prospect by 247Sports, appeared in four games this season and got extensive run during USC's opener against Missouri State, completing all nine of his pass attempts for 69 yards and a touchdown. Because he appeared in just four games, this will be a redshirt year for him. USC also signed four-star quarterback Jonas Williams in its 2026 class. \nHigh expectations for USC heading into 2026Maiava returning coupled with the fact that USC just finished with the No. 1 overall recruiting class in the 2026 cycle by 247Sports, the pressure is on Riley to produce results -- more specifically, a berth in the College Football Playoff. USC has never participated in the CFP since the four-team format was introduced back in 2014, but Riley was plucked away from Oklahoma to push the Trojans back into the top tier of the sport. So far, he has under-delivered with a 35-17 overall record across his four seasons. The Trojans won 11 games in Riley's first season at the helm before dropping to 8-5 in 2023 and 7-6 in 2024, USC's first year as a member of the Big Ten. With a win over TCU in the Alamo Bowl on Dec. 30, Riley can secure his second 10-win season with USC.While Maiava will be back in the fold, USC will likely have to replace its top three pass catchers from this season as wide receiver Ja'Kobi Lane and tight end Lake McRee have already declared for the draft, while Makai Lemon -- this year's Biletnikoff Award recipient -- projects as a first-round pick. Looking ahead to next season, could Tanook Hines emerge as a go-to target? Hines, a freshman, has 28 catches for 398 yards and two touchdowns this season and should be in line for a larger role in 2026 as Maiava tries to boost his stock among a 2027 NFL Draft crop that is projecting to be full of star power.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Michigan football program currently sits in limbo days after former coach Sherrone Moore was fired for cause and later charged with one felony count and two misdemeanors after an alleged inappropriate relationship with a staff member.Michigan has launched a review into the athletic department's handling of Moore's firing with law firm Jenner & Block spearheading the probe. The process has been described to CBS Sports as \"open-ended,\" and there is no telling what it will unearth, when it will end, who will face consequences for the findings and what those consequences will be. The question is whether the industry's perception of uncertainty at Michigan is reality, or if the truth is somewhere in between.A Michigan source told CBS Sports Tuesday morning: \"Warde is our AD and moving forward with the coach search,\" and multiple sources confirmed the school has hired TurnkeyZRG, a high-profile search firm, to assist in finding a new head coach.\nAfter Moore's firing, industry sources expressed varying degrees of a lack of faith in Manuel's skill as an administrator and doubt about whether he'll be allowed to run this process. That is also in addition to the fact that Michigan has not had a university president since May and is still months away from naming a permanent one with interim Domenico Grasso planning to retire at the end of his interim tenure. All of this raises significant concerns about alignment at Michigan, a buzzword in the industry but an important factor -- especially with a job of Michigan's caliber and the timing involved with filling it between the early signing period and the transfer portal opening.\n        \n            \n                Michigan coaching search: Behind the buzz for Eli Drinkwitz, Kenny Dillingham and separating fact from fiction\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nElevating Biff Poggi comes with significant riskNature abhors a vacuum, and considering the hefty one in Ann Arbor right now, is there a chance Michigan brass chooses another option? Current interim coach Biff Poggi has communicated with the team his desire to get the job, a source confirmed to CBS Sports. There is also some support among Michigan players for Poggi. The situation has some elements of how Terry Smith's candidacy gained steam at Penn State, where a long period of quiet regarding the Nittany Lions search allowed an opening for alums and players to advocate for Smith publicly. There is the possibility, as the dust settles, that Poggi could be a bridge option so Michigan can do a more conventional search with more lead time and more of their ducks in a row, administration-wise; however, that route comes with the optics of the Wolverines punting on 2026 and wasting one of the precious few seasons remaining with phenom Bryce Underwood at quarterback. On the flip side, if Poggi can prove that he can mostly hold Michigan's signing class together, (the Wolverines have lost two signees already), could that be enough to show medium-term stability? There is much still to be sorted out regarding the situation in Ann Arbor.\nUpdate on big names at forefront for Michigan jobAs far as external options for Michigan, Kenny Dillingham is in negotiations with Arizona State regarding a contract extension, but an industry source indicated he would listen if Michigan were to show serious interest. To this point, they have not.Ahead of Washington's bowl game against Boise State, former Michigan assistant Jedd Fisch addressed links to the job: \"I'm fully focused on our team.\" Kalen DeBoer also continues to say the right things at Alabama after putting out a statement Sunday and addressing the rumors directly in his Monday press conference ahead of the Crimson Tide's College Football Playoff first-round game against Oklahoma on Friday.\"My family loves living here. All the things we continue to build on. Love the progress. Haven't talked with anyone. No plans of talking with anyone. I think that's a lot of what I said a couple weeks ago and it continues to be the same thing. Our guys, if there's been any distraction, I haven't seen it. Haven't felt it. We've probably all-season long have dealt with enough noise where it doesn't surprise me on how they've handled this.\"\nWhen asked point blank if he will be the coach of Alabama, Deboer said, \"Yeah, planning on being, yes.\"Brandon Marcello contributed to this report.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        One year after leading the Washington Commanders to their first NFC Championship Game in over 30 years, Jayden Daniels' second season in the NFL is ending very differently than his first. Monday, Washington coach Dan Quinn said the team has shut down Daniels for the season due to the dislocated elbow injury Daniels re-aggravated in Week 14.Daniels initially suffered the injury in Week 9 against the Seattle Seahawks but was cleared to return by Week 14 against the Minnesota Vikings. At the time Quinn had maintained Daniels getting reps was important, even with the team out of the playoff race. However, Daniels landed hard on the elbow, exited and did not return. His last throw of the season, as it turns out, was an interception.\"Super tough, man,\" Daniels said Tuesday of the team's decision to hold him out. \"I don't want to miss games at all. It's been frustrating being associated with missing games. I want to be out there helping my teammates as much as possible, so it's just been a frustrating year at this point, but you learn from it and you move forward.\"\n        \n            \n                Commanders shut down QB Jayden Daniels for remainder of 2025 season\n                \n                    Jordan Dajani                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDaniels played in just seven games this season, and he only finished four. He sprained his knee late in Week 2 against the Green Bay Packers but was able to finish the contest. He then strained his hamstring against the Dallas Cowboys in Week 7 and did not return. Then came the elbow injury and re-aggravation in his next two appearances.\n\"Frustrated, disappointed, a lot more emotion, but probably a lot of adversity that I've dealt with on the field for the most part,\" Daniels said about his experience this season. \"And just trying to learn and keep moving forward.\" Daniels did not go on IR, meaning he can (and will) still practice with Washington. He mentioned \"being the best teammate\" for backup quarterback Marcus Mariota, trying to improve and \"see the game from a different lens\" as areas he can focus on over the next few weeks.Daniels started all 20 of Washington's games last year (including playoffs), so his inability to remain healthy this season added a layer to his frustration.\n\"The one game I missed for my hamstring, and my knee, obviously my elbow isn't something that you can really necessarily prepare for,\" Daniels said. \"So, it's most definitely frustrating and at that time, very I would say traumatic, stuff like that. You never know what you do, you see different things. So, I just gotta just move forward and get ready for next year.\"One year after winning Offensive Rookie of the Year, Daniels finishes his second season with 1,262 passing yards, eight touchdowns, and three interceptions through the air. He also ran for 278 yards and two touchdowns.The Commanders were mired in an eight-game losing streak before a 29-21 road win over the New York Giants last Sunday. Next is a home game against the NFC East-leading Philadelphia Eagles on Saturday.\n            ",

    "body": "\nWe have just three weeks left in the 2025 NFL regular season, and Week 16 presents plenty of intriguing matchups, including two games on Saturday. After a rough Week 14, favorites bounced back in a big way in Week 15. What does that mean for bettors looking to place NFL money line parlays this week? NFL betting expert Jeff Hochman has put together two three-leg money line parlays for Week 16, with one consisting solely of favorites, and the other of three underdogs. NFL three-team favorite money line parlay benefitsBetting heavy favorites can be a solid strategy if you want to bet on a three-team NFL money line parlay. This approach focuses on teams with odds of -150 or better, which means you lean toward high-probability outcomes. By pairing three teams that usually have odds between -150 and -350 or even higher, you're not only aiming for consistent, modest returns, but you're also stacking the deck in your favor for a higher chance of winning. Remember that you can still parlay a favorite with odds of -140 or less to avoid laying 2.5 points, which can significantly impact your chances of winning. Remember, you have to win all three legs for a successful wager.According to BetMGM data, NFL money line favorites at -115 or shorter posted a 68% win percentage in 2023 and a 66.5% rate in 2022. Over the six-season period from 2018-24, NFL money line favorites maintained a 66.6% win rate (1,013-508-7). The strength of favorites correlates directly with their odds. In sports betting, if you see teams with odds between -150 and -200, they generally have a solid chance of winning with around a 60-65% success rate. Teams that are even bigger favorites with odds from -250 to -400 tend to be more reliable, showing win rates of about 70% to 80%. The 2024 NFL season stood out for favorites, with an overall win rate hitting 71.8%.In Week 15, NFL betting favorites bounced back after a disappointing Week 14, posting an impressive 11-5 record. This season, favorites have now secured 152 wins out of 223 games, sustaining a strong 68.1% success rate. What can we expect in Week 16? Will the favorites continue their streak, or will underdogs rise to the occasion? Check out Jeff's top money line parlays featuring both favorites and underdogs.Week 16 NFL money line favorites parlay\nDetroit Lions over Pittsburgh Steelers\nThe Detroit Lions have alternated wins and losses the past 10 games. They are coming off a loss, falling 41-34 as 5.5-point road underdogs against the Rams. Pittsburgh is coming off a short week after playing on Monday Night Football. Dan Campbell and Co. have won 15 consecutive regular-season games immediately following a loss. The Lions have not dropped back-to-back games since Weeks 7 and 8 of the 2022 season, and their offensive efficiency (6.2 yards per play, tied for first) starkly contrasts with Pittsburgh's defensive metrics (5.4 yards allowed per play). Detroit ranks first in the NFL in points per game at 30.6, while Pittsburgh allows 23.3 points per game. The Lions also rank 10 spots higher in total DVOA.Jared Goff played well in Detroit's loss to Los Angeles, completing 25 of his 32 passes (78.1%) for 338 yards and three touchdowns. Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jameson Williams both had strong games against the Rams' secondary. Detroit's defensive line consistently pressures quarterbacks -- the Lions sack opponents at a 9.52% rate, fourth-best in the NFL. Given Aaron Rodgers' limited mobility at this stage of his career, Detroit's pass rush should create problems.Pittsburgh will be without T.J. Watt, who had surgery on Dec. 12 to repair a partially collapsed lung, and he is expected to miss multiple weeks. The Steelers have managed to win more than two consecutive games only once this season, and that was following their bye week. The Steelers allow 120.9 rush yards per game (19th), which could benefit Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery. Gibbs averaged 2.9 yards per rush in his last game. I would take a long look at his rushing props to go \"Over.\" Take the Lions in this smash-mouth spot at home.Tampa Bay Buccaneers over Carolina Panthers \nTampa Bay's sack differential advantage (+0.2 vs. -0.6 per game) will be critical against a Carolina offense that's been vulnerable under duress. The Panthers allow 31 sacks (tied with the Buccaneers) but generate only 23 sacks themselves -- a massive negative swing. While both teams are struggling (Bucs on a two-game losing streak, Panthers alternating wins and losses), Tampa Bay has significantly higher-quality wins earlier in the season and has played a more demanding schedule (No. 12 vs. No. 26).The Panthers want to run the ball early and often with Rico Dowdle and Chuba Hubbard. This plays right into the hands of the Bucs' defense, especially with Vita Vea in the middle of that defensive line. Tampa Bay is ranked 10th in rushing yards against, which will force Bryce Young into obvious passing downs.My betting model loves the road team. The Buccaneers have a 6.5-point edge at this line, with projections showing a 9.27-point margin and 78.3% win probability. I have more confidence playing Tampa Bay on the money line considering this is a division matchup. The Panthers have defensive strengths in specific areas (red zone and pass efficiency) but lack the pass-rush impact or offensive firepower to consistently move the ball against a Buccaneers team that should dominate time of possession and field position. Tampa Bay also benefits from extra preparation time following last Thursday's debacle -- and the Bucs have dominated this matchup, winning nine of the last 10 meetings. I like Baker Mayfield and Co. to bounce back in this spot.Denver Broncos over Jacksonville Jaguars\nThe Denver current market line of -3 is roughly 2.5 to 3.5 points softer than advanced metrics suggest. According to my model, Denver would be favored by 5.5 to 6 points on a neutral field (-200). Add in the well-established home-field advantage at Mile High (about +2.8 points), and the true line should be closer to Denver -7 or -8.5. (-350 to -400). At -3, Broncos backers are getting significant value. All we need is an outright victory.Denver's defense is stifling in the red zone, allowing touchdowns on just 38.4% of opponent trips -- the best in the NFL. This is a nightmare for Jacksonville, as Trevor Lawrence's QBR is 51.8 (21st). While Lawrence can move the ball, Denver's red zone efficiency is the single largest predictive edge in this matchup. The Broncos also excel at ending drives. Opponents convert on third down just 31.9% of the time against Denver, the top mark in the league. On the other hand, Jacksonville's offense is below average on third downs (25th at 36.8%). The Jaguars will find it tough to sustain drives, which will compound their red-zone challenges.Denver owns the NFL's second-best pass rush, notching sacks on 10.5% of opponent dropbacks. With Jacksonville's offensive line riddled by injuries and multiple starters questionable, Trevor Lawrence is likely to face relentless pressure from all angles -- even without Denver needing to blitz. Historically, Lawrence's interception rate spikes when he's hurried, giving the Broncos a prime opportunity to force game-changing turnovers.Consistency is often overlooked, but it is a vital metric this late in the season. Denver ranks third in the league with an 8.5 consistency rating, executing their game plan with precision at home. Jacksonville's volatility (12.3 rating, 23rd overall) makes it unpredictable and more prone to lapses, especially on the road. Adding to their challenges, Jacksonville will be playing just its second outdoor road game since late September. Expect the Broncos to capitalize and secure another win.NFL three-team underdog money line parlay benefitsA very popular option is available if you're willing to take on a bit more risk for a potentially higher reward. Underdog money line parlays offer the largest possible payouts in the NFL betting landscape. Combining three underdogs with odds like +200, +150, and +300 could result in payouts exceeding 20-to-1 or higher. The best part is that, due to the high payouts, underdog parlays can still be profitable even when winning only a small percentage of bets. For example, hitting just one of several large underdog parlays could offset multiple losses and generate overall profit. NFL underdogs have historically outperformed expectations in specific situations, with home underdogs of +2 to +3 winning outright 46-48% of the time.Week 16 NFL money line underdog parlay\nTennessee Titans over Kansas City Chiefs \nI promised never to take the Tennessee Titans on these pages, but this is a unique spot after Patrick Mahomes' unfortunate torn ACL that will keep him out for at least a calendar year. Gardner Minshew, a five-year journeyman backup, takes over as the Chiefs' starter. This transition is significant: Minshew had not thrown a pass all season before Week 15, when he threw an interception on his first attempt. His career record stands at 17-29, putting him well below league-average. The Chiefs' offense -- seventh in yards per game at 357.9 yards -- was already built around Mahomes' arm talent and improvisational ability.The Chiefs have been officially eliminated from playoff contention, the first playoff miss since 2014. This elimination removes any competitive incentive for the organization. When a team enters a game mathematically eliminated from the postseason, players and coaches shift into a \"just finish the season\" mentality. Kansas City still possesses superior talent at nearly every position and has a proven offensive system (despite a quarterback downgrade).On the surface, the Titans face a tanking disincentive, and additional wins hurt their draft positioning. However, interim head coach Mike McCoy has stated the team maintains a \"burning desire to win\" regardless of its 2-10 record. This creates an unpredictable dynamic where Tennessee might be unusually energized to beat a historically superior opponent while Kansas City plays out the string. After seeing their playoff hopes dashed last week, it's common for teams in this spot to lack energy and struggle to get motivated.Los Angeles Chargers over Dallas Cowboys \nStart with the basics: the Chargers have outscored opponents by 31 points this season. The Cowboys, on the other hand, have been outscored by nine. That 40-point difference says a lot about where these teams stand. The Chargers also average +0.3 more yards per play on offense versus defense (12th in the league), while Dallas breaks even (0.0, 29th). Both teams have really good kickers and banged-up offensive lines. Los Angeles is able to game plan around it, while Dallas seems to struggle when it matters most.There are three glaring differences in this matchup. The Chargers allow 279.1 yards per game (second best) while the Cowboys allow 374.9 yards per game (29th). Against Justin Herbert's balanced offense and the Chargers' strong receivers, this is catastrophic for Dallas. Additionally, the Chargers' opponent passer rating of 71.1 (best in league) versus the Cowboys' 109.1 (worst in the league) tells the story. Finally, the Chargers are ranked fifth in red zone defense while the Cowboys are ranked 30th.Dallas' secondary is historically bad this season, especially when the defensive front doesn't generate pressure on opposing quarterbacks. Jim Harbaugh is coaching up his offensive line despite all the injuries. I have all the confidence in the Chargers' coaching staff against the Cowboys' coaches. The Chargers have posted an impressive 14-4 record since Week 8 over the past two seasons. I would expect more of the same.New England Patriots over Baltimore Ravens\nMy model gives the New England Patriots a 56% chance of winning outright with a projected final score of 27-25. The Patriots have been a juggernaut on the road (6-0), flourishing away from home. Conversely, the Ravens have been a liability at M&T Bank Stadium this season, posting a 3-5 home record.New England has a top-seven scoring defense (19.7 PPG allowed), while Baltimore's defense has regressed to league average (22.9 PPG allowed, ranking 15th). Drake Maye has emerged as an MVP-caliber talent, completing a league-leading 70.9% of his passes for 3,567 yards with 23 touchdowns and only six interceptions. His passer rating sits at 109.1, and he's added 362 rushing yards and four touchdowns on the ground. Meanwhile, Lamar Jackson's recent form represents the inverse trajectory -- his completion percentage has plummeted to 56%, and he's averaging 7.0 yards per attempt with a passer rating of just 69.7 over his last four games.The Ravens have struggled under the lights, managing just a 1-3 record in prime-time games and going winless (0-2) at home. Meanwhile, the Patriots have thrived in the spotlight, winning all three of their prime-time matchups so far. The Patriots may have let a 21-point lead slip away against the Bills last week, but they've bounced back from setbacks all year and still sit atop the AFC East with an 11-3 record. The loss provides extra motivation for the Pats. Mike Vrabel has an impressive 33-16 career record in games immediately following a loss as an NFL head coach, between his time with the Tennessee Titans and his current squad.\n            ",

Only Manny Pacquiao and Oscar De La Hoya claimed world titles in more weight classes than Crawford, who was a perfect 20-0 (15 KOs) in title fights. \n        \n            \n                Terence Crawford makes his case as best fighter of his generation with all-time outing against Canelo Alvarez\n                \n                    Brian Campbell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHe will go out on top in a way few boxers do, with his final fight being a sensational unanimous decision victory over Canelo Alvarez to claim the undisputed super middleweight crown and ascend to the top of the pound-for-pound ranks. \nCrawford released a video on his YouTube channel announcing his decision and thanking his fans, haters and opponents for their role in pushing him to greatness while noting he's \"at peace\" with his decision to walk away from the sport at 38 years old. \n\"You just never know when. I spent my whole life chasing something. Not belts. Not money. Not headlines. But that feeling, that one you get when the world doubts you, but you keep showing up and you keep proving everyone wrong,\" Crawford said. \"This sport gave me everything. I fought for my family. I fought for my city. I fought for the kid I used to be, the one who had nothing but a dream and a pair of gloves. And I did it all my way. I gave this sport every breath I have. Every scar. Every triumph. Every ounce of my heart. And I've made peace with what's next. \"Now, it's time. Thank you.\"Boxing retirements always come with an asterisk as we've seen countless fighters lured back to the ring, but at this moment, Crawford walks away from the sport on top, with no mountains left to climb. \nAs he notes in his video, the chase was always what drove him in the ring, and having reached the summit he feels it's time to step away and live life outside of boxing. \n            \n    ",

He's been playing in relief of Purdy, who aggravated his toe injury during the 49ers' Week 4 loss to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/JAC/jacksonville-jaguars/\">Jaguars</a>. Purdy initially sustained the injury during the 49ers' Week 1 win over the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SEA/seattle-seahawks/\">Seahawks</a>. </p><p>With Purdy out, Jones started the 49ers' following two games. He threw for 279 yards and three scores in the 49ers' Week 2 win over the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NO/new-orleans-saints/\">Saints</a> before throwing for 284 yards with a touchdown and a pick in San Francisco's Week 3 victory over the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ARI/arizona-cardinals/\">Cardinals</a>. </p><p>Jones returned to the bench for Week 4, and while Purdy threw for 309 yards and two touchdowns, he also turned the ball over three times that included two interceptions that led to 10 Jaguars points. His fumble late in the fourth quarter helped seal Jacksonville's 26-21 win. </p>\n<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nfl-week-6-picks-score-predictions-lions-stun-chiefs-49ers-upset-buccaneers/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>NFL Week 6 picks and score predictions: Lions stun Chiefs, 49ers upset Buccaneers in NFC showdown</p>\n                <p>\n                    John Breech                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"NFL Week 6 picks and score predictions: Lions stun Chiefs, 49ers upset Buccaneers in NFC showdown\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/01/004c872b-e757-46f3-bd3b-381d895cf166/thumbnail/270x152/801c696f037d747ee1616c0d3638e719/amon-ra-st-brown-lions.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>With Purdy back on the mend, Jones returned to the starting lineup last Thursday night against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/\">Rams</a>. In what was arguably his greatest <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> performance so far, Jones light up the Rams' defense to the tune of 342 yards and two touchdowns on 33 of 49 passing. </p><p>Jones was 5 of 6 passing in overtime while helping set up the 49ers' game-winning field goal. </p>\n<p>While Purdy is still the 49ers' longterm starting quarterback, Jones will get another chance to show what he can do this Sunday in a game between two teams with 4-1 records. Sunday could be another big game for Jones, as the Buccaneers' defense is currently 20th in the NFL in passing yards allowed, 24th in touchdown passes allowed and are 29th in the league in red zone efficiency. </p>\n            </div>\n    </div>",

So much so that the Shrine Bowl scouting staff already has Alabama's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28878532/ty-simpson/\">Ty Simpson</a> with a comparable grade to more established starters like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26701706/garrett-nussmeier/\">Garrett Nussmeier</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28916321/fernando-mendoza/\">Fernando Mendoza</a> (although Shrine Bowl grades are used more for bucketing players into potential roles and are less granular than <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/teams/\">NFL team</a> grades).  </p><p> From a numbers standpoint, it's not hard to see why. His 9.4 yards per attempt ranks 10th in the country, while his 13 touchdown passes rank eighth. Those numbers also came against the third-hardest schedule in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football</a>, according to ESPN -- even with Simpson and the rest of the Crimson Tide laying an egg against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/FSU/florida-state-seminoles/\">Florida State</a> in Week 1. Since that game, I'd argue no quarterback has played better the past five weeks than Simpson. </p><p> Unlike other breakout stars such as <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/news/dante-moore-2026-nfl-draft-scouting-report/\" target=\"_blank\">Oregon's Dante Moore</a></span> or <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/news/could-oklahomas-john-mateer-become-the-latest-transfer-qb-to-end-up-as-the-no-1-pick-in-the-nfl-draft/\" target=\"_blank\">Oklahoma's John Mateer</a></span>, Simpson's film takes a little longer to see why he's getting scouts' attention. That's because between his arm, mobility and frame -- there isn't a single trait I'd describe as \"above-average\" by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> standards. I don't want you to think he's poor in any of those categories, but <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football</a> is littered with quarterbacks who can match Simpson's physical profile. </p><p> It's not until you see him layer the football over second-level defenders, lead receivers away from coverage consistently and attack zones with anticipation -- that's when you start to understand that Simpson has the goods. It was the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WISC/wisconsin-badgers/\">Wisconsin</a> tape in Week 3 where he first caught my eye. In that game, he went 24-for-29 passing for 382 yards, four touchdowns and no interceptions. Of the five times the ball hit the ground, two were because of drops.</p></div>\n<p>From a mechanical, timing and decision-making perspective, it was how an NFL-ready quarterback is supposed to look. That's special for the third start of someone's career. If I had to point to the one thing I've consistently seen on tape that makes Simpson so good, it's knowing how to attack space in defenses. At quarterback, you're not always throwing routes as they're drawn up on paper. Sometimes you have to stop a receiver with your ball placement or lead them elsewhere to avoid defenders. You saw that on numerous occasions last week against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/VANDY/vanderbilt-commodores/\">Vanderbilt</a>.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/college-football-qb-power-rankings-alabamas-ty-simpson-takes-no-1-nico-iamaleava-returns-to-top-50/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>College Football QB Power Rankings: Alabama's Ty Simpson takes No. 1, Nico Iamaleava returns to top 50</p>\n                <p>\n                    David Cobb                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"College Football QB Power Rankings: Alabama's Ty Simpson takes No. 1, Nico Iamaleava returns to top 50\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/08/48290fb7-58ce-427b-b279-8b771794ecdd/thumbnail/270x152/f42e45b40bcfc2a205357e8c23b43d36/ty-simpson-qb-power-rankings.png\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<div><p>Simpson is an intriguing prospect for a lot of reasons, but one thing working against him is his age. He's older than you'd like for a prospect getting their first opportunity, as he'll turn 23 years old in December. With on-field experience being at a premium for evaluators, he'll face an interesting decision. Come back to school and turn 25 as a rookie, or make the leap with one season as a starter under his belt. </p><p> While the answer to that question will become clearer as the season wears on, it's important to remember why experience matters. It's because mastery matters when put in an unfamiliar situation. Mastering the minutiae of the quarterback position -- footwork, mechanics, protections, eye discipline and more -- before you get to the league is a must. There's so much else that's heaped onto your plate in the league as a young quarterback that if you're thinking about your ball-handling, you won't process the rest of the game at the speed you need to.</p></div><p>With Simpson, I'm not too worried about the minutiae given what he's already put on tape. Yes, there's no replicating reps when it comes to consistently reading coverages and blitzes, but Simpson has clearly put in the work when it comes to what he could control as a backup for three years.</p>\n<p>On top of simply continuing the level of play we've seen from Simpson through the rigors of an SEC schedule, the one thing I want to see more of from the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BAMA/alabama-crimson-tide/\">Alabama</a> signal-caller is aggressiveness downfield. He certainly has the receivers to attack deep and is accurate on such throws, but to date, he ranks 83rd in deep attempts in all of college football, with 17 (10 completions). In Michael Penix Jr.'s final season with Kalen DeBoer at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WASH/washington-huskies/\">Washington</a> in 2023, he ranked first with 117. Penix's average depth of target was 10.7 compared to Simpson's 8.1. </p>\n<p>Add in some aggressiveness to Simpson's already efficient play, and the NFL will come calling early.</p><h3>2026 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/\">NFL Draft</a> No. 1 pick odds</h3><table> <thead><tr><th>Player</th><th>School</th><th>Odds</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>QB Fernando Mendoza</td><td><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/IND/indiana-hoosiers/\">Indiana</a></td><td>+380</td></tr><tr><td>QB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29122116/lanorris-sellers/\">LaNorris Sellers</a></td><td><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/SC/south-carolina-gamecocks/\">South Carolina</a></td><td>+430</td></tr><tr><td>QB Dante Moore</td><td>Oregon</td><td>+430</td></tr><tr><td><strong>QB Ty Simpson</strong></td><td><strong>Alabama</strong></td><td><strong>+600</strong></td></tr><tr><td>EDGE <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29125808/rueben-bain-jr/\">Rueben Bain Jr</a>.</td><td><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MIAMI/miami-fla-hurricanes/\">Miami</a></td><td>+1200</td></tr><tr><td>QB Garrett Nussmeier</td><td><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/LSU/lsu-tigers/\">LSU</a></td><td>+1200</td></tr><tr><td>QB John Mateer</td><td>Oklahoma</td><td>+1500</td></tr></tbody></table><p><em>Bet college football with <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\">Fanduel Sportsbook</a>, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager.</em></p><h2>Ty Simpson <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/\">NFL Draft</a> profile</h2>\n<ul><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/prospect-rankings/\" target=\"_blank\">CBS prospect ranking:</a></strong> No. 4 QB (37th overall)</li></ul><h3>Ty Simpson college stats</h3><table> <thead><tr><th>Year</th><th>G</th><th>S</th><th>Comp</th><th>Att</th><th>Comp %</th><th>Yards</th><th>TD</th><th>INT</th><th><strong>Y/A</strong></th><th>Pass Rate</th><th>Rush Yards</th><th>Rush TD</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>2025</strong></td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>111</td><td>158</td><td>70.3%</td><td>1,478</td><td>13</td><td>1</td><td>9.4</td><td>174.7</td><td>51</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2024</strong></td><td>6</td><td>0</td><td>14</td><td>25</td><td>56.0%</td><td>167</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>6.7</td><td>112.1</td><td>44</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2023</strong></td><td>6</td><td>0</td><td>11</td><td>20</td><td>55.0%</td><td>179</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>9.0</td><td>130.2</td><td>86</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2022</strong></td><td>4</td><td>0</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>80.0%</td><td>35</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>7.0</td><td>138.8</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Career</strong></td><td>21</td><td>5</td><td>140</td><td>208</td><td>67.3%</td><td>1,859</td><td>13</td><td>1</td><td>8.9</td><td>162.1</td><td>181</td><td>5</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ty Simpson 247Sports profile</h3><p><strong>High school:</strong> Westview (Martin, Tennessee)<br /><strong>Class:</strong> 2022<br /><strong>Rating:</strong> ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (98)</p><p><strong>National:</strong> 29 | <strong>QB: </strong>4 | <strong>Tennessee: </strong>2</p>\n<p><em>Check out Ty Simpson's </em><a href=\"https://247sports.com/player/ty-simpson-46056473/high-school-218790/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>full 247Sports profile</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n            </div>\n    </div>\n</article>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                        </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n        <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677803/sami-whitcomb/\">Sami Whitcomb's</a> fiery spirit and timely shooting helped spur the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/PHO/phoenix-mercury/\">Phoenix Mercury</a> to the 2025 WNBA Finals. But if the team hopes to stave off elimination after falling into a 0-3 hole to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/LVA/las-vegas-aces/\">Las Vegas Aces</a> in the best-of-seven series, Whitcomb must play a key role off the bench in Game 4 on Friday night. </p><p>Thankfully, with the season on the line and Mercury trailing the Aces in perimeter shooting by roughly five percentage points, this moment seems tailor-made for a Whitcomb outbreak. </p><p>\"We trust her with every single shot; it doesn't matter,\" Mercury forward <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677941/satou-sabally/\">Satou Sabally</a> said. \"She's made five, she's missed five. Like she's open, she will get the ball.\" </p><p>When Whitcomb joined the Mercury last offseason, she was looking for a reset. </p><p>The eight-year WNBA veteran started her career in Seattle, where she won two championships with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/SEA/seattle-storm/\">Storm</a>. She had a two-year stint in New York before returning to Seattle in 2023.</p>\n<p>Last season was one of the worst of her career. Whitcomb's 15 minutes per game were her lowest since her rookie and sophomore seasons in the league, and her average 3-point percentage dipped below 30% for the first and only time. Her inconsistent role led the Australian Olympian to explore free agency. </p><p>In Phoenix, the 37-year-old's game has found new life. This season, Whitcomb's 3-point and field-goal percentages have returned to her career averages, and her 9.2 points per game are the second-most in her WNBA tenure. This postseason, Whitcomb's 6.2 points per game match her career high. </p><p>\"I feel like I'm playing well and helping the team. That's obviously why I came here. I came here to help us, you know, be in this position that we are now,\" Whitcomb told CBS Sports.</p>\n<p>So far, she hasn't shown her best against the Aces. After an injury scare in Game 1, Whitcomb's shooting numbers have plummeted. The Mercury sharp shooter went 0-8 from the floor and 0-6 from the perimeter in the last two games of the series.</p><p>The good news for Phoenix fans is that the Mercury and Whitcomb are familiar with having their backs against a wall. After Sabally went down on Wednesday night with an apparent head injury, the team went on a 9-0 run in under 40 seconds to tie the game. It took a clutch <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677908/aja-wilson/\">A'ja Wilson</a> shot and a clean defensive effort for the Aces to win a game they led by as many as 17 points. Earlier this postseason, the Mercury completed a 20-point comeback against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/MIN/minnesota-lynx/\">Minnesota Lynx</a>.</p><p>\"When you've got people that really just care about [toughness] more than anything else, none of these things sort of seem, I don't want to say difficult, but they don't seem impossible,\" Whitcomb said. \"Like getting down 20, it doesn't seem like an impossibility that we can fight back. It doesn't seem like an impossibility that we had to go and win two games after losing the first one in that New York series. Everything feels possible with this group because of that toughness.\" </p>\n<p>For Whitcomb, that fight has manifested into an increased defensive effort. </p><p>\"There's such a high-level commitment to it. It's really lifted my defensive game, as well as just my efforts and my focus on that end,\" Whitcomb said. </p><p>\"Most people think Sami is just a shooter, but you know, if you haven't watched her game over the years, whether it's W or overseas, she impacts the game in so many ways,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/2130768/alyssa-thomas/\">Alyssa Thomas</a> said. </p><p>Phoenix delights in making life as difficult as possible for its competition. Sabally, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677851/kahleah-copper/\">Kahleah Copper</a> and especially Thomas are the three-headed defensive dog that fuels Phoenix. Aside from their physical style of one-on-one defense, Phoenix does a good job moving their opponents out of position. The Mercury gave up the second-fewest second-chance points (9.5) and points in the paint (33.9) per game in the regular season.</p>\n<p>But while defense is important in the desert, Whitcomb is indispensable to Phoenix because of her ability to shoot from the perimeter. </p><p>The undrafted University of Washington alumna has shot 50% or better from the field in 13 games and 50% or better from the perimeter 12 times this season. She posted a career-high 36 points in a July 7 game against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/DAL/dallas-wings/\">Dallas Wings</a>. </p><p>Whitcomb's ability to space the floor opens up the paint for the Big 3. And, of course, a perfectly timed 3-pointer can be a jolt for her team and a back breaker for opponents. </p>\n<p>The Australian drained a huge 3-pointer in Game 2 of the semifinal series against the  Lynx that tied the game 79-79 with 3.4 seconds left in regulation. The clutch shot forced overtime, where Phoenix would ultimately get a six-point road win. It was a huge momentum shift, though you might not have known it from Whitcomb's reaction. The veteran took one deep breath and prepared to defend Minnesota's final offensive attempt.</p><p>Her calm and confidence stem from her preparation. Data tracked from the new Phoenix practice facility revealed she's taken over 15,000 shots over the course of the 2025 season. That is reportedly 5,000 more shots than the top five <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nba/\">NBA</a> players took in their season, which is significantly longer. </p><p>Whitcomb is also a phenomenal leader. Oftentimes, she can be seen communicating in the team huddle at key moments in a game. </p>\n<p>\"Sami is a leader through and through. The pregame speeches, the work that she puts in, the example that she just sets. It's incredible. It's amazing for me to see, for me as a younger player, like I just look up to her every single day,\" Sabally said. </p><p>Her leadership, defense and shooting ability will all be needed if the Mercury plan on extending their season.</p><p>\"In the course of any season, there are ups and downs. You can call them peaks and valleys if you want. It's nice to be in a space right now where I feel confident,\" Whitcomb said.</p>\n            </div>",

That 83.3% cover rate is the best in the NFL over this span, and the Eagles are also 6-2 ATS in divisional games since 2024. Meanwhile, the Giants have covered in just two of their last eight NFC East games, and just two teams in the league have a worse cover percentage in divisional contests since the start of 2024.</p><p>Much has been made about the Eagles offensive struggles, but one shouldn't overlook that no team is protecting the ball like Philly. Its one giveaway on the season is the fewest in the NFL, while <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2240246/jalen-hurts/\">Jalen Hurts</a> is the only quarterback who's started every game this year that hasn't thrown an interception.

While not a trade many envisioned, it made sense for both sides with Cincinnati addressing their quarterback issues after <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2179798/joe-burrow/\">Joe Burrow</a>'s injury and the Browns removing further clutter from their once-crowded quarterback room. </p><p>Now, the Browns are left with an all-rookie QB depth chart, with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121534/dillon-gabriel/\">Dillon Gabriel</a> as the starter and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26710004/shedeur-sanders/\">Shedeur Sanders</a> as the apparent backup -- barring a last-minute addition of a veteran to the roster. Cleveland's QB situation has been under the microscope since they drafted both Gabriel and Sanders, particularly given Sanders' massive following, and he explained on Thursday that he's grateful for his time learning from Flacco but admits there's some added excitement knowing there's \"<a href=\"https://x.com/MaryKayCabot/status/1976345567149330688\" target=\"_blank\">light at the end of the tunnel</a>\" now that he's no longer buried quite as deep on the depth chart. </p><p>\"It was definitely surprising,\" Sanders said of the trade. \"[Flacco] was definitely a great teammate. And I'm just thankful to spend some time with him.\"</p><p>\"You tend to get a little bit more excited when you see a light at the end of the tunnel, for sure,\" Sanders said. \"So, my job at first was to prepare the defense — and I think I did a pretty good job [laughs]. … Whatever my role is here, I'm thankful and I'm happy just to do that.\" </p>\n<p>It was a decidedly different tone to Sanders' availability than some of his past conversations with the media -- including one in which he only mouthed words and didn't actually speak. We'll see if the Browns allow for this more optimistic version of Sanders to remain as the backup to Gabriel, or opt for the addition of a veteran to push him down on the depth chart again and restart the clock on frustration with Sanders' role. </p>\n            </div>\n    </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n        <div><p>The best quarterbacks in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> have a knack for making things look easy. The great irony is that it's not. It's the product of an immensely talented individual having enough repetition to feel the confidence that comes along with mastery of a craft. It's a combination that shines almost immediately when you see it.  </p><p> Through five weeks of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football</a> season, no quarterback has exuded that quality more so than <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OREG/oregon-ducks/\">Oregon's</a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28895698/dante-moore/\">Dante Moore</a>. In only his ninth career start, Moore walked into a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/PSU/penn-state-nittany-lions/\">Penn State</a> whiteout and <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/2025-heisman-trophy-roundtable-dante-moore-john-mateer-among-standout-candidates-through-september/\" target=\"_blank\">took down the No. 3 team in the country</a></span>. He completely outdueled <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28876938/drew-allar/\">Drew Allar</a> in the process and only put the ball in harm's way once all day on an overtime two-point conversion.  </p><p> While Moore's talent has been evident since he was the No. 4 overall recruit, <a href=\"https://247sports.com/player/dante-moore-46084709/high-school-235999/\" target=\"_blank\">per 247Sports</a>, in the 2023 class, his route to potential QB1 in the 2026 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/\">NFL Draft</a> has been a road less traveled in modern times.</p></div><p>Moore started his career at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UCLA/ucla-bruins/\">UCLA</a>, where he started five games as a true freshman under Chip Kelly. With Kelly on the way out after that season, Moore entered the transfer portal.</p><p>Instead of seeking a guaranteed starting job, Moore opted for the Ducks, who already had lured <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121534/dillon-gabriel/\">Dillon Gabriel</a> away from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OKLA/oklahoma-sooners/\">Oklahoma</a> to be their starter. It was a path reminiscent of the one <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180829/kyler-murray/\">Kyler Murray</a> took. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ARI/arizona-cardinals/\">Arizona Cardinals</a> quarterback was a freshman starter himself at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TXAM/texas-am-aggies/\">Texas A&M</a>, but after that season opted to transfer to Oklahoma despite <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2080032/baker-mayfield/\">Baker Mayfield</a> being the established starter. After two seasons on the bench, Murray's game was transformed, as he became the best quarterback in the country and the No. 1 overall pick in the 2019 NFL Draft.</p><p>The year off served Moore similarly well, as he's developed into a completely different quarterback than the last time we saw him. The scintillating arm talent and athleticism are obviously still there, but Moore's newfound unflappability in the pocket has been eye-opening. He's averaging a ridiculous 8.8 yards per attempt when under pressure this season with no interceptions and has the second-lowest pressure-to-sack conversion rate in the country (3.2%). From an evaluation perspective, that's the holy grail.</p>\n<p>As I stated before, that sort of calm only comes with mastery, and it's clear on tape that Moore's mechanics are elite already. Whether it's his easy, repeatable motion or crisp footwork, Moore's dedication to his craft is evident. The rep below illustrates what I'm talking about beautifully. He gets his feet lined up at the top of his drop to throw the over, stops mid-motion when he realizes the linebacker has jumped it, and immediately resets into perfect alignment to throw the dig coming behind it.</p><div><p>It's like Tiger Woods stopping mid-swing when a phone goes off -- he makes it look easy, but it is not easy. There are starting quarterbacks in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> who can't do what Moore did above without getting skittish feet. And that was in Week 1.  </p><p> I want to reiterate that we're only five games into the season. There are still numerous tests Moore needs to pass before the first round is even a possibility, including No. 8 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/IND/indiana-hoosiers/\">Indiana</a> in a couple weeks, as well as a likely Big Ten Championship Game and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">College Football</a> Playoff run.</p></div><p>In those five games, though, he's given very little reason to be concerned about him passing those tests. And he's absolutely flashed No. 1 overall pick-level of physical ability.</p>\n<p>Watching how easily he pushes the ball downfield, Moore can't help but conjure up images for me of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3123337/jayden-daniels/\">Jayden Daniels</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/LSU/lsu-tigers/\">LSU</a>. With seemingly little effort, the ball explodes out of his hand 50-plus yards downfield.</p>\n<div><p>That's how you want a top pick at quarterback to spin it. That's an athlete who could have excelled at a lot of different sports, but decided to focus on quarterbacking. That's someone who can be developed even further at the next level. </p><p> Of course, the rush to crown someone as the \"next big thing\" in today's immediate gratification age has resulted in some embarrassing whiffs on prospects. No one is crowning Moore just yet, as evidenced by his +700 odds to go No. 1 overall, per <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\">DraftKings Sportsbook</a></span>.</p></div><p>Rather, so few of the top quarterbacks have played impressive enough ball to even be considered with the No. 1 overall pick by season's end. Indiana's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28916321/fernando-mendoza/\">Fernando Mendoza</a> is one. Oklahoma's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28915380/john-mateer/\">John Mateer</a> was another before his injury. After that, Moore might be the only other. </p>\n<p>And if he improves upon what we've seen from him through five weeks this season and doesn't have any regression games, he'd be my pick.</p><h3>2026 NFL Draft No. 1 pick odds</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Player</th><th>School</th><th>Odds</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>QB Fernando Mendoza</td><td><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/IND/indiana-hoosiers/\">Indiana</a></td><td>+380</td></tr><tr><td>QB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29122116/lanorris-sellers/\">LaNorris Sellers</a></td><td><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/SC/south-carolina-gamecocks/\">South Carolina</a></td><td>+430</td></tr><tr><td><strong>QB Dante Moore</strong></td><td><strong>Oregon</strong></td><td><strong>+430</strong></td></tr><tr><td>QB Ty Simpson</td><td>Alabama</td><td>+600</td></tr><tr><td>EDGE <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29125808/rueben-bain-jr/\">Rueben Bain Jr</a>.</td><td><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MIAMI/miami-fla-hurricanes/\">Miami</a></td><td>+1200</td></tr><tr><td>QB Garrett Nussmeier</td><td><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/LSU/lsu-tigers/\">LSU</a></td><td>+1200</td></tr><tr><td>QB John Mateer</td><td>Oklahoma</td><td>+1500</td></tr></tbody></table><p><em>Bet college football with <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\">Fanduel Sportsbook</a></span>, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager.</em></p><h2>Dante Moore <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/\">NFL Draft</a> profile</h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/prospect-rankings/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>CBS prospect ranking</strong></a><strong>:</strong> No. 6 overall (No. 2 QB)</li></ul><p><em>To check out all of CBSSports.com's most recent mock drafts, </em><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/mock-draft/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>click here</em></a><em>.</em></p><h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> comparison: Deshaun Watson</h3><p>There's no great one-to-one comp for Moore's skillset.

The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Eagles</a> linebacker sustained a serious knee injury during Philadelphia's 2024 playoff run but was a full participant in practices both Tuesday (estimated) and Wednesday.

One of his biggest games last year took place against the Giants in Week 7, when he tallied 11 tackles and two sacks in Philadelphia's 28-3 win. </p><p>Dean registered seven games with at least 10 tackles last year that included each of his final four regular season games. He made six tackles during the Eagles' wild-card round playoff win over the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/GB/green-bay-packers/\">Packers</a> before sustaining his season-ending knee injury. </p>\n<p>With Dean out, his replacement in the starting lineup this season has been rookie first-round pick <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28875305/jihaad-campbell/\">Jihaad Campbell</a>, who is third on the team in tackles. Campbell recorded a forced fumble during the Eagles' season-opening win over the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DAL/dallas-cowboys/\">Cowboys</a> and made his first career interception off of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2080032/baker-mayfield/\">Baker Mayfield</a> during Philadelphia's Week 4 win over the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TB/tampa-bay-buccaneers/\">Buccaneers</a>. </p>\n<p>Dean's return gives Philadelphia valuable linebacker depth and scheme options.

The Longhorns decimated Oklahoma in two of the last three years when the Sooners had backup quarterbacks. </p><h2>  Texas vs. Oklahoma: Need to know  </h2><p><strong>Limited offense:</strong> Despite playing three bottom-feeding nonconference opponents, Texas has struggled mightily on offense. The Longhorns are bottom-half in the SEC in total and scoring offense, and mustered only 11 yards rushing from running backs in the loss to Florida. The Longhorns scored zero points in the first three quarters against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OHIOST/ohio-state-buckeyes/\">Ohio State</a>, and seven in the first 40 minutes against Florida. </p><p><strong>Fearsome defense:</strong> Oklahoma boasts perhaps the best overall defense in America after a dominant early slate. The Sooners rank No. 1 in both dropback and rushing defensive success rate, and rank No. 2 in defensive EPA margin. Oklahoma averages a nation-leading 10 tackles for loss per game, with 14 different players recording multiple so far. Against a struggling Texas offensive line, the Sooners should cause real chaos. </p>\n<p><strong>Quarterback questions:</strong> Oklahoma starting quarterback John Mateer is questionable for the matchup against Texas as he recovers from hand surgery. Sophomore <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29390586/michael-hawkins-jr/\">Michael Hawkins Jr</a>. scored four touchdowns in a 44-0 win over Kent State, but struggled when inserted last season. However, Texas quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29122638/arch-manning/\">Arch Manning</a> has been wildly inconsistent since taking over as starter, completing 56% of passes at 7.3 yards per attempt and three touchdowns to three interceptions against power conference foes. </p><h2>  Where to watch Texas vs. Oklahoma live  </h2><p><strong>Date</strong>: Saturday, Oct. 11 | <strong>Time</strong>: 3:30 p.m. ET<br />  <strong>Location</strong>: Cotton Bowl -- Dallas, Texas<br />  <strong>TV: </strong>ABC | <strong>Live stream: </strong><a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191261?irad=399332&irmp=416484&sharedid=HTW\" target=\"_blank\">Fubo</a> (Start watching, save $20!)</p><h2>  Texas vs. Oklahoma prediction, picks  </h2>\n<p>Unlike most of the past few Red River Rivalries, this one will be a defensive showdown between lackluster offenses.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MIZZOU/missouri-tigers/\">Missouri</a> has been magnificent in recent history, but is still trying to beat the bluebloods in the SEC. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BAMA/alabama-crimson-tide/\">Alabama</a> comes to town as a slight favorite in the biggest showdown in the conference in Week 7.</p><p>Mizzou is an incredible 25-5 in its last 30 games, but most of those losses have come against the best of the best in the SEC (Alabama, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UGA/georgia-bulldogs/\">Georgia</a>, LSU), which has kept the Tigers from reaching that next level of contenders. The Tigers won 10 games last season but were still blanked 34-0 by the Tide, showing just how far they were from being among the SEC's elite.</p><div><p>The No. 14 Tigers (5-0, 1-0 SEC) have started hot, again, but against a relatively easy schedule. The first five games ranked 80th nationally in strength, but the final seven games include four ranked opponents, making it the 12th-hardest remaining schedule in the land. </p><p>Meanwhile, No. 8 Alabama (4-1, 2-0) is seeking a 3-0 start in the SEC with all wins coming against AP Top 25 teams, which would be a first for the tradition-rich university. The Tide has rebounded nicely from their season-opening loss at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/FSU/florida-state-seminoles/\">Florida State</a>. Mizzou is seeking a third straight home win against a top 25 team for the first time since 1973.</p></div><h2>Alabama vs. Missouri: Need to know</h2><p><strong>Big Game DeBoer:</strong> Alabama coach Kalen DeBoer is incredible in ranked-on-ranked matchups. He's 13-2 in those games, the best winning percentage (.867) for any head coach in AP poll history. He's also 17-3 overall against top 25 teams, the second-most wins by an active head coach since 2021, ranking second behind Georgia's Kirby Smart (22), who he defeated earlier this season in Athens.</p><p><strong>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29336062/ahmad-hardy/\">Ahmad Hardy</a> Problem:</strong> Mizzou's Ahmad Hardy has emerged as the nation's leading running back, running for 730 yards and nine touchdowns through five games. He's run for 100-plus yards in seven straight games, the longest active streak in the FBS dating back to his playing days at ULM. Remember, Alabama's identity has changed quite a bit from the Nick Saban era. The Tide have been out-rushed in half their games under DeBoer, compared to only 19.6% of their games in the Saban era. Alabama is 4-5 under DeBoer in those games and Saban was 31-15. Somehow, Alabama has won both of its games against top 25 teams this season despite allowing 7 yards per rush.</p>\n<p><strong>Streaks made to be broken:</strong> Missouri has won 15 straight games at home, the second-longest active streak in the FBS. Alabama has defeated Mizzou six straight times. The Tigers last defeated the Tide in 1975.</p><h2>Where to watch Alabama vs. Missouri live</h2><p><strong>Date</strong>: Saturday, Oct. 11 | <strong>Time</strong>: 12 p.m. ET<br /><strong>Location</strong>: Faurot Field -- <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/CLMB/columbia-lions/\">Columbia</a>, Missouri<br /><strong>TV: </strong>ABC | <strong>Live stream: </strong><a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191261?irad=399332&irmp=416484&sharedid=HTW\" target=\"_blank\">Fubo</a> (Start watching, save $20!)</p><h2>Alabama vs. Missouri prediction, picks</h2>\n<p>Alabama has struggled to score more than four touchdowns in its games against mid- to upper-tier power programs, which is fine, particularly with the defense playing so much better of late. Missouri loves to run the ball, ranking third nationally, and leads the nation in time of possession. The Tigers scored 29 in their only SEC game this season. The Tide ranks No. 1 in turnover margin, which could make for a lower-scoring game for the explosive Tigers. Picking a winner is difficult, especially with a 3.5-point spread in favor of Alabama, so we'll go with the point total (51.5) and side with the teams sliding just under.  <strong><em>Pick: 51.5u</em></strong></p>\n<div><table><thead><tr><th><br /></th><th><div>\n                    <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"player headshot\"

The six-time NBA All-Star <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/jayson-tatum-injury-update-celtics-star-doesnt-rule-out-2025-26-return-focused-on-making-full-recovery/\">indicated last month on CBS Sports HQ</a> that he would be open to playing this season if he is back at full strength in time to do so.</p><p>\"I think the most important thing is making a full recovery and being 100%,\" Tatum said. \"If that's this season, there's obviously conversations to be had. For me, I love to play. I've never been a guy that wants to sit out and I try to play in every game possible.\"</p>\n<p>A pertinent factor in a potential 2025-26 return is the Celtics' standing in the playoff picture. If the team is out of the postseason hunt in the latter stages of the campaign, it could be less inclined to risk putting Tatum on the court. If he is healthy, though, the veteran forward could be the missing piece to a playoff run. After all, he was one of the NBA's top players before the injury and in 2024 guided the Celtics to a championship.</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kevin-durants-rockets-debut-provides-glimpse-of-what-could-be-nbas-next-great-trio/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Kevin Durant's Rockets debut provides glimpse of what could be NBA's next great trio</p>\n                <p>\n                    Brad Botkin                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Kevin Durant's Rockets debut provides glimpse of what could be NBA's next great trio\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/09/e4f36824-9594-4dde-a1fc-ed8b62001596/thumbnail/270x152/5454c926966d3e3e7f61ff4898ab6213/100825-kevindurant.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>Achilles injuries generally carry recovery timelines of at least a calendar year. Tatum tore his tendon on May 12 in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference semifinals, so any potential return in the upcoming regular season would put him well ahead of schedule.</p><p>\"It's been tough, it's been a rollercoaster. It's been emotional,\" Tatum said in September. \"It's a new experience for me. ... Our first practice is a week from today and I won't be able to be out there with the team. I won't be out there to start the season. That's been a tough pill to swallow and something I've been working through every day.\"</p>\n<p>Tatum's looming absence, whether or not he returns at some point this season, will be the longest of his career to date. The perennial MVP vote-getter has not sat out more than 18 games in a season throughout his eight-year career.</p>\n            </div>",

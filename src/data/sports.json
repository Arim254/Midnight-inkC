In those eight regulation defeats, only three goals have been scored, and even Mike Sullivan is sounding disgusted with proceedings.

    "body": "\n        Days ahead of the Big 12 Championship Game between BYU and Texas Tech, the Cougars have agreed to a long-term contract extension with coach Kalani Sitake. Sitake emerged as the target of Penn State's search on Monday, per multiple sources. He was offered by the Nittany Lions and momentum seemed to be trending toward the 50-year-old taking the Penn State job. However, sources told CBS Sports that BYU made an aggressive push over the last 24 hours to keep Sitake home. That culminated Tuesday when BYU announced its new deal with Sitake. \"We are excited to announce a long-term agreement to extend Kalani Sitake as BYU's head football coach,\" athletic director Brian Santiago said. \"He is a proven leader, and we are grateful he is once again choosing BYU. His legacy of building a championship program the BYU way will continue on. He is one of the best people in the business. We are excited to continue to ride the wave of positive momentum with him.\"All of this came to a head the day before the start of the early signing period and just a few days out from BYU's first appearance in the Big 12 title game. The 11th-ranked Cougars (11-1) remain a strong College Football Playoff contender and would clinch a spot in the 12-team bracket with a win over No. 4 Texas Tech on Saturday. Amid all the Penn State discourse that emerged Monday, Sitake met with his team, per a source. He didn't shoot down the Penn State rumors in that meeting. \n\n        \n            \n                Penn State's cookie problem: Crumbl CEO, other BYU donors make push to keep Kalani Sitake in Provo\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBut the BYU donor base has deep pockets, including Crumbl founder Jason McGowan, and they rallied to keep Sitake, an alumnus of the program, for the foreseeable future. \"I am humbled and full of gratitude for the outpouring of love from BYU fans and the trust and support provided to our football program by our university leadership,\" Sitake said. \"I'm thankful to President Shane Reese, Vice President Keith Vorkink and our Athletic Director Brian Santiago and his leadership team for the confidence they continue to place in me to lead our program and to take care of our players, coaches and staff. This is good for the stability and future of BYU football. I'm excited about our future.\" Sitake is in Year 10 with the Cougars and has a 83-44 overall record with the school. He helped BYU navigate the transition to the Big 12 in 2023. The Cougars are 22-3 over the last two seasons. \nPenn State's coaching search has been a labored and secretive process, with a wide range of candidates rumored. Coaches who have been linked with the process include those like Vanderbilt's Clark Lea, Missouri's Eli Drinkwitz and Nebraska's Matt Rhule. All three have received contract extensions since the job opened. Interim head coach Terry Smith has also been a factor in the search.  \n            ",

The deal will keep him in Lubbock through the 2032 season and pay McGuire more than $7 million annually by its conclusion, with incentives that could push his total compensation even higher. The contract comes as the No. 5 Red Raiders prepare to face No. 11 BYU in the Big 12 Championship Game this Saturday. Texas Tech enters at 11-1, marking the program's first appearance in the conference title game. With their record and strong résumé, the Red Raiders are considered essentially locked into the College Football Playoff regardless of the outcome. McGuire, who is in his fifth season at Texas Tech, has steadily built the program into a contender, and this year has been a long-awaited breakthrough for the Red Raiders. Off the field, the school's aggressive investment in NIL deals and revenue-sharing has helped attract and retain top-level talent, a key factor in the team's turnaround. Texas Tech brought in the No. 2 transfer portal class in the country last cycle, according to 247Sports. Hired before the 2022 season, McGuire owns a 34-17 overall record at Texas Tech, leading the program to bowl appearances each year -- only the second coach in school history to do so after the late Mike Leach. His 24 wins in the Big 12 are the most among any current conference team, and Texas Tech is the only program to post an above-.500 conference record each year during that span. \nBefore taking the Texas Tech job, McGuire established himself as one of Texas' top high school coaches, spending more than a decade leading Cedar Hill High School. During his tenure, he turned a struggling program into a state powerhouse, winning three state titles, reaching four championship games, and making the playoffs 12 consecutive seasons.  His success at the high school level earned him a role at Baylor, where he served as an assistant in various roles. McGuire helped improve the Bears' defense and strengthened the recruiting pipeline, further cementing his reputation as a developer of talent and a skilled recruiter. \nThe new contract reflects the program's rising profile and McGuire's success, cementing his place at the helm as Texas Tech seeks to make a run in both the Big 12 and the College Football Playoff. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The most significant ranking in the penultimate College Football Playoff Rankings had nothing to do with Miami or Texas. Instead, the playoff committee showed their hand. With the final spot in the rankings, the CFP Committee ranked James Madison at No. 25 in the country. The Dukes are 11-1 and face Troy in the Sun Belt Championship Game on Friday. By winning, James Madison can all but assure itself a spot in the final rankings for the first time in program history. But if JMU accomplishes the feat and finishes as a ranked conference champion, it could set off a nightmare scenario for the ACC that would leave them out of the playoff entirely. For clarity, let's go back to the protocol. The top five conference champions are guaranteed auto bids in the College Football Playoff field. It's very specifically the top five conference champions; the Power Four conferences are not implicitly guaranteed a spot. Technically, all five spots could be taken by Group of Six champions, if they were earned in the rankings. \nWhen the CFP bracket is mocked, No. 12 Miami plays the role of the fourth conference champion auto-bid. There's just one problem: The Hurricanes -- the best team in the ACC -- aren't eligible for the auto-bid. In fact, thanks to a bloated conference and convoluted set of tiebreakers, unranked Duke plays No. 17 Virginia for the ACC crown. And in Duke, the ACC has its perfect, disastrous storm. The Blue Devils had a lackluster season, limping out to a 7-5 record. Three of those losses came in nonconference play, with horrendous performances against Illinois, Tulane and UConn. But when it comes to conference contention, none of those games matter. Duke's only losses came against Georgia Tech and Virginia. And therefore, Duke is now in the ACC Championship Game as one of the weakest conference finalists in years. As only 3.5-point underdogs, the Blue Devils have a serious chance of pulling the upset. But with five losses, Duke would be all but guaranteed to finish behind both the American Conference champion and Sun Belt champ James Madison, despite winning a power conference championship. \nIf James Madison was unranked, it would be easy for the committee to sit back and say that they consider the Blue Devils and Dukes as comparable teams. A win over No. 17 Virginia would supersede any on JMU's schedule. But by ranking James Madison, the committee has shown their hand. James Madison is a top 25 team in the eyes of the committee. Duke is not. And furthermore, based on their resume, the Blue Devils aren't anywhere close. If Duke wins the ACC, the conference could become the first power league to ever miss the 12-team College Football Playoff. At the Group of Six level, conferences are much more sensitive about tiebreaker rules setting up their teams for failure. Some work around it with blatant playoff-driven advantages. The primary tiebreaker in the American Conference is simply CFP Rankings. Even though No. 24 North Texas has a better record, No. 20 Tulane is hosting the title game for the express purpose of giving them an easier path to the playoff. Not so in the ACC. \nSMU was painfully close to helping the league avoid this fate. The Mustangs led California late in the fourth quarter on Saturday night. A win would have elevated SMU and Virginia as 7-1 teams. Instead, the Mustangs' loss pushed them into a five-way tie for second. And coming out of the tiebreaker -- combined conference opponent record -- was perhaps the weakest team in the group. Virginia is favored to win the ACC Championship Game on Saturday. If the Cavaliers do, they'll easily slot into the CFP with the No. 11 seed. Their chances wouldn't be great in a road game against No. 6 Ole Miss, but at least the ACC would send a champion to the postseason. But thanks to James Madison's No. 25 ranking, the ACC is officially on the hot seat. A Duke conference championship would spell disaster for the league, and end with two Group of Six teams in the field for the first time ever. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 Major League Baseball offseason is fully underway, and we're working our way through the sport's offseason calendar. Among other things, the winter in baseball means a steady supply of rumors regarding free agent signings, trades, and the like. Speaking of which, you can find Tuesday's roundup just below. Nats listening on MacKenzie Gore The Nationals under new lead decision-maker Paul Toboni are listening to trade offers on 26-year-old lefty MacKenzie Gore, ESPN reports, but they're not inclined to move him unless they get a particularly strong proposal. \nGore is coming off a 2025 campaign in which he earned his first All-Star selection, but he faded badly down the stretch. One of the key return pieces in the 2022 trade that sent Juan Soto to the Padres, Gore has an ERA+ of 98 across four MLB seasons. He's under team control through the end of the 2027 season. Reds remain in on SchwarberCount the Reds as one of the teams still pursuing designated hitter Kyle Schwarber, according to MLB.com. Cincinnati would like to upgrade an offense that ranked in the middle of the pack in runs scored and in the bottom 10 in park-adjusted offense last season. For whatever it's worth -- and the answer is, usually, \"not much\" -- Schwarber happens to from Ohio. The Phillies, Mets, and Red Sox, among others, are also believed to be involved in the bidding on Schwarber, suggesting he may have to take a serious hometown discount if he's to end up with Cincinnati. \nBrewers inclined to keep PeraltaAfter the Brewers signaled that they may be looking to trim payroll ahead of the 2026 season, many justifiably assumed that ace Freddy Peralta might be on the trade block this winter. While that might yet be the case, ESPN reports that the Brewers for now are inclined to hold the line and enter the 2026 season with Peralta at the front end of a strong rotation that also includes Brandon Woodruff, Jacob Misiorowski, and Quinn Priester. Edwin Díaz return still a possibility for MetsThe Mets' signing of high-leverage reliever Devin Williams gives them an option at closer for 2026 and beyond, but the Williams addition doesn't mean a reunion with Edwin Díaz is out of the question. \nDiscussions with Díaz are ongoing, but to get a deal the two sides will need to bridge a gap in terms of contract length, the Athletic reports. Díaz's side is angling for five years coming off a stellar 2025, but the Mets would prefer not to commit more than three years to the right-hander who's going into his age-32 campaign. Notably, Williams is willing to work in a setup role, which at least in theory clears the decks for a Díaz return. First, though, comes the much more significant hurdle of agreeing to terms. \nWillson Contreras willing to consider tradeCardinals catcher-turned-first baseman Willson Contreras has for some time said he prefers to remain with St. Louis through what's taking shape as a significant rebuild. However, the Athletic reports that stance has changed and Contreras is now willing to consider waiving his no-trade clause for a deal to a contender.\nContreras in 2026 had an OPS+ of 123 with excellent quality-of-contact indicators. He's signed through 2027 and owed $36.5 million over the final two years of his contract. He moved off of the catcher position last season in order to reduce wear and tear and to give way to the Cardinals' glut of catching prospects arriving in the majors. A willingness to return to catching on a part-time basis would likely enhance Contreras' trade value, but it's not yet known whether that's a consideration. Angels add ManoahThe Angels are signing right-hander Alek Manoah to a one-year pact worth less than $2 million, according to ESPN. Manoah, 27, did not pitch in the majors last season and has seldom been healthy and productive at the same time since finishing in third place in the American League's Cy Young Award race in 2022. He figures to compete for a rotation spot next spring.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Toronto Blue Jays have reached an agreement with free-agent starter Cody Ponce on a three-year pact worth $30 million, according to MLB.com's Mark Feinsand. Ponce is the second starter the Blue Jays have added in the past week. They also officially announced their seven-year deal with Dylan Cease, a $210 million pact that's the largest free-agent contract ever handed out by the Toronto franchise. Ponce, 31, has not pitched at the MLB level since 2021. He spent last season with the Hanwha Eagles of the Korea Baseball Organization, starting 29 times and amassing a 1.89 ERA and a 6.15 strikeout-to-walk ratio. CBS Sports ranked Ponce as the 45th-best player on the market. Here's what we wrote at the time:Ponce, 32 come April, will return stateside after spending a few years overseas, first in Japan and then in South Korea. He'll look nothing like he did during his first 20 career MLB appearances. These days, he's capable of touching into the upper-90s with his heater and throws, among other secondaries, a quality splitter. There are enough KBO-to-MLB pitching success stories -- ranging from someone with staying power, in Merrill Kelly, to more fleeting cases, like Erick Fedde and Chris Flexen -- to envision a team giving Ponce a rotation spot on a multi-year pact to demonstrate where he lands on that spectrum.Here's more to know about the Ponce signing.The Blue Jays have a rotation surplusIn addition to Cease and Ponce, the Blue Jays had Shane Bieber remain in his contract rather than execute an opt-out clause and enter free agency. Factor in Kevin Gausman, star rookie Trey Yesavage, and José Berríos, and Toronto has the luxury of having more capable starters than rotation slots. And that's without mentioning Bowden Francis, who has started nearly 30 times the past two years, or Eric Lauer, who had a 3.18 ERA in 104 innings in 2025.PitcherIPERASO/BBKevin Gausman1933.593.78Trey Yesavage (MLB)143.212.29Shane Bieber40.13.575.29José Berríos1664.172.46Dylan Cease1684.553.03Cody Ponce (KBO)180.21.896.15Of course, that's a good problem to have at this or any point in time because it gives the Blue Jays options and contingency plans. They can entertain trading from that group, and they can toy with shifting a couple members to the bullpen. They can also enter camp knowing that if and when an injury happens -- and pitchers are known for getting hurt on occasion -- they have internal backups already in place.\nKeep in mind, the Blue Jays didn't have that luxury entering last year, when they had to rush to sign Spencer Turnbull and José Ureña to serve as stopgaps on an injury-ravaged staff.Bullpen, shortstop remain questions for AL champsWhat else do the defending American League champions need to do this winter? A few things.Foremost, the Blue Jays have been linked to most of the high-leverage relievers of note, including right-hander Pete Fairbanks. It stands to reason they'll attempt to add quality instead of quantity to their relief corps. That's because Toronto is starting to run into a numbers game with its pitching staff. With Ponce included, the Blue Jays now have nine pitchers who cannot be optioned to the minors. If Yesavage is part of the Opening Day rotation -- and you would assume he is -- then Toronto really has only three \"flex\" spots, depending on how they proceed with the rest of the winter. \nElsewhere, the Blue Jays have to figure out if they're going to retain free agent Bo Bichette, turn to an internal replacement, or try to land a new shortstop from outside the organization. Bichette, considered one of the best free agents available, hasn't yet generated much rumor mill buzz ahead of the start of next week's Winter Meetings. Should the Blue Jays stay in house, the path of least resistance would have them slide Andrés Giménez to short and install Ernie Clement at second base. \n            ",

Durkin has been with the program since 2024, when Hugh Freeze hired him to fix an ailing defense. He made an immediate impact in his first season at Auburn. Under his guidance, the Tigers posted their best rushing defense since 2010 (117.8 ypg), the best total defense since 2017 (330.8 ypg) and the best scoring defense since 2019 (19.5 ppg).Durkin served as Auburn's interim coach after the school fired Hugh Freeze, guiding the Tigers to a 1-2 record and a near upset of rival Alabama in the Tigers' season finale.  Auburn hired Golesh from USF on Sunday as it looks to reclaim a position as an SEC contender after five consecutive losing seasons, the school announced Sunday.\n\"Auburn Football is one of the proudest, most tradition-rich programs in all of college football and my family and I could not be more excited to join the Auburn Family,\" Golesh said in a release. \"This will be a player-driven program, and no one will outwork our staff. Auburn has won, can win and will win championships. Let's get to work.\"Auburn has not had a winning season since Gus Malzahn's final year in 2020 when they went 6-5. Since then, the Tigers have gone 28-35 and have made it to two bowl games, losing both. This year the Tigers went 1-7 in conference play and finished tied for 13th with Mississippi State and South Carolina, with only Arkansas below them. \nAfter back-to-back 7-6 seasons, Golesh led USF to a 9-3 record in 2025 that included wins over Boise State and Florida to start the year. The Bulls eventually slipped out of the American Athletic Conference title race with losses to Memphis and Navy, but still posted their best season in nearly a decade. That performance made Golesh a hot name on the coaching market, and after reportedly turning down Arkansas, Golesh opted to take the opportunity on the Plains. \n            \n    ",

However, in 11 games played this year, Thielen caught just eight passes for 69 yards. He was made a healthy scratch this past week, as the Vikings were blanked by the Seattle Seahawks, 26-0.\n        \n            \n                Vikings release Adam Thielen: Minnesota parts ways with veteran WR, who wants larger role before retiring\n                \n                    Jordan Dajani                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThielen was productive for the Carolina Panthers over the last two seasons, crossing 1,000 yards receiving in 2023, and averaging 61.5 receiving yards per contest in 10 games played in 2024. Thielen, in his 12th NFL season, was picked up by the Vikings as an undrafted free agent in 2013 and ended up playing nine years for the team. He ranks fourth in franchise history in receptions (542), fifth in receiving yards (6,751) and third in receiving touchdowns (55).In Pittsburgh, Thielen joins a wide receiving corps headlined by DK Metcalf, although he is the only pass-catcher to cross 300 yards receiving this season. In Thielen, Aaron Rodgers acquires a veteran playmaker that can move the chains.\nThe 6-6 Steelers find themselves in a heated AFC North race. The Baltimore Ravens, also at 6-6, own the tiebreaker, while the 4-8 Cincinnati Bengals are lurking in the background with Joe Burrow back in the fold. Pittsburgh has a 44.8% chance to win the division, and 45.1% chance to make the playoffs, according to SportsLine data expert Stephen Oh. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        With just five weeks to play in the regular season, this is shaping up to be one of the wildest playoff races in NFL history. Through the first 13 weeks, there have been ZERO playoff spots clinched and that number won't be changing this week, because there's not a single clinching scenario in Week 14, which is something that almost never happens. The last time the NFL made it through the first 14 weeks without a single team clinching a playoff spot came all the way back in 2014. The 2014 season ended with the Seahawks and the Patriots as the top seeds, which is mostly notable, because we could see that exact same thing happen this year. With all 14 spots up for grabs, that might have you wondering who's going to make the postseason this year and since everyone wants to know, we're going to be publishing a playoff projection every week from now until the end of the season. These projections will be based on data from number-cruncher Stephen Oh of SportsLine. Each week, Oh will plug some numbers into his SportsLine computer and simulate the rest of the season. Using those numbers, we'll project the 14 teams that we expect to make the playoffs, plus we'll give you the postseason chances for all 32 teams. \nWith that in mind, let's get to the projection. Remember, this is just a projection. If you want to see the actual playoff picture, we've got that here. On the other hand, if your favorite team has already been eliminated from playoff contention -- I'm looking at you Titans, Raiders, Giants, Cardinals and Saints fans -- here's a mock draft, since you'll probably get way more use out of reading this. AFC playoff projectionProjections via SportsLine\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. New England Patriots (AFC East champion)Remaining schedule: BYE, Bills, at Ravens, at Jets, DolphinsAt this point, the computer is pretty confident that the Patriots (11-2) will end up earning the No. 1 overall seed in the AFC, which would give them a bye into the divisional round. The most difficult game left on New England's schedule will come against Buffalo in Week 15, but the Patriots will get extra time to prepare for that game since they have a bye in Week 14. Basically, everything is coming up New England this year. The Patriots are also the overall Super Bowl favorite for the first time his year. According to the computer, New England has a 13.6% chance of winning the Super Bowl (The Seahawks have the next highest chance at 11.9%). \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. Denver Broncos (AFC West champion)Remaining schedule: at Raiders, Packers, Jaguars, at Chiefs, ChargersThe Broncos (10-2) could take over the No. 1 seed in the AFC with a win over the Raiders on Sunday, but the reason the computer doesn't think Denver will stay there is because the Broncos have a brutal schedule down the stretch. They have to play four playoff contenders over the final four weeks, including divisional games against two teams that could be desperately looking to keep their playoff hopes alive (Chiefs and Chargers). \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Jacksonville Jaguars (AFC South champion)Remaining schedule: Colts, Jets, at Broncos, at Colts, TitansThe AFC South race is likely going to go down to the wire, and right now, the computer has the Jaguars' outlasting both the Colts and Texans to take home the division title. The biggest thing working in the Jags' favor is that they have the easier strength of schedule than the other two teams. If the Jags (8-4) beat the Jets and Titans, then pull off a split with the Colts, that will put them in good shape to win the division. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Baltimore Ravens (AFC North champion)Remaining schedule: Steelers, at Bengals, Patriots, at Packers, at SteelersWith the way things are going, there's a chance that the AFC North winner could finish the season with a losing record. Right now, the Ravens (6-6) are being projected to win the division with a record of 9-8, but if they slip up or if the Steelers struggle down the stretch, it wouldn't be surprising if an 8-9 team wins the division. The Ravens have a 48.9% chance of winning the division, followed by the Steelers at 44.8%. And for you Bengals fans out there, Cincinnati is at 6.3%, so they're not quite dead yet, especially with Joe Burrow back. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Buffalo Bills (Wild card 1)Remaining schedule: Bengals, at Patriots, at Browns, Eagles, JetsWith the Bills (8-4) trailing the Patriots by two games in the AFC East, the computer doesn't think Buffalo is going to be able to win the division, giving them just an 11.9% chance to pull it off. Josh Allen has never won a road playoff game and that could make things interesting since the Bills are being projected to play on the road in the wild-card round.  \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Indianapolis Colts (Wild card 2)Remaining schedule: at Jaguars, at Seahawks, 49ers, Jaguars, at TexansAfter losing two straight games, Indianapolis (8-4) is no longer being projected to win the AFC South. However, the good news for the Colts is that they still control their own fate. If they win out, they'll win the division. Right now, the computer is giving them a 36.6% chance of winning the AFC South. The Jaguars are at 36.9% and the Texans are at 26.6%, so this division is wide open heading into Week 14. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Los Angeles Chargers (Wild card 3)Remaining schedule: Eagles, at Chiefs, at Cowboys, Texans, at DenverWe don't need a computer for this part of the projection, we need a doctor. Justin Herbert just had surgery on his left hand, and now, there's no guarantee that he's going to play this week. If Herbert has to miss more than one game, that would dramatically change this projection. Herbert seems to know that every game is important from here on out, which is likely why he's looking to play on Monday night against the Eagles. Other AFC playoff chances: Texans (58.7%), Steelers (45.1%), Chiefs (37.6%), Bengals (6.4%), Dolphins (0.1%), Browns (0.0%), Jets (0.0%), Raiders (ELIMINATED), Titans (ELIMINATED). Note: The Raiders, Jets, Browns and Titans aren't eliminated, but their odds are listed at zero because the computer has given up on them.\nAFC wild-card round projection (7) Chargers at (2) Broncos (6) Colts at (3) Jaguars (5) Bills at (4) Ravens Bye: PatriotsNFC playoff projectionProjections via SportsLine\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Los Angeles Rams (NFC West champion)Remaining schedule: at Cardinals, Lions, at Seahawks, at Falcons, Cardinals The Rams (9-3) are NOT currently the No. 1 seed in the NFC, but the computer expects them to be there by the end of the season. The biggest thing working in their favor is that they have an easier remaining strength of schedule than almost any other contender. Don't be surprised if the winner of the Rams-Seahawks game in Week 16 ends up earning the No. 1 overall seed.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. Green Bay Packers (NFC North champion)Remaining schedule: Bears, at Broncos, at Bears, Ravens, at Vikings The computer loves the Packers (8-3-1). Right now, Green Bay is being given a 90.1% chance of making the playoffs, which makes them a virtual lock to get in. They also have a 52.2% chance of winning the NFC North, which is well ahead of the Bears at 41%. Based on those numbers, you can probably guess who the computer is projecting to win the Bears-Packers game on Sunday. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Philadelphia Eagles (NFC East champion)Remaining schedule: at Chargers, Raiders, at Commanders, at Bills, CommandersAfter losing two straight games, the Eagles' (8-4) lead in the NFC East is down to just 1.5 games, but the computer doesn't think they're going to blow that lead. Right now, the Eagles have a 86.4% chance of winning the division and that's mostly due to the fact that they have the fourth-easiest remaining strength of schedule in the NFL. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (NFC South champion) Remaining schedule: Saints, Falcons, at Panthers, at Dolphins, Panthers The computer has the Buccaneers (7-5) winning the NFC South by one game over the Panthers (7-6). This race is definitely going to be interesting and that's mostly because the Panthers and Buccaneers will face each other twice over the final three weeks of the season. If either team can pull off a sweep, that team will likely win the division.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Seattle Seahawks (Wild card 1)Remaining schedule: at Falcons, Colts, Rams, at Panthers, at 49ersThe Seahawks (9-3) have the fourth-most difficult remaining strength of schedule, which is one reason why the computer has them playing in the wild card round. Of course, if Seattle can beat the Rams in Week 16, that will certainly open the door for them to win the NFC West and possibly even earn the No. 1 overall seed in the NFC. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. San Francisco 49ers (Wild card 2)Remaining schedule: BYE, Titans, at Colts, Bears, SeahawksThe 49ers (9-4) have been one of the most banged up teams in the NFL this year, but they get a bye this week, which will allow them to recharge for the stretch run. The computer likes the fact that the 49ers will be getting some rest, which is why San Francisco is being projected into this wild card spot. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Chicago Bears (Wild card 3)Remaining schedule: at Packers, Browns, Packers, at 49ers, LionsThe Bears haven't made the playoffs since 2020, but the computer sees that five-year drought ending this year. Although the Bears are currently atop the NFC North, the computer is expecting them to struggle down the stretch. That being said, the Bears will end up getting this spot over the Lions, and if that happens, everyone in Chicago will probably be thrilled to steal a playoff spot from a division rival.   Other NFC Playoff Chances: Lions (37.8%), Cowboys (24.5%), Panthers (15.6%), Falcons (0.1%), Vikings (0.0%), Commanders (0.0%), Cardinals (ELIMINATED), Saints (ELIMINATED), Giants (ELIMINATED)\nNFC wild-card round projection (7) Bears at (2) Packers (6) 49ers at (3) Eagles (5) Seahawks at (4) Buccaneers Bye: Rams\n            ",

Yes. It was a winning week both ways for me with my NFL picks last week.As the NFL season winds down, I am starting to get hotter than Cleveland Browns fans when you say their quarterback of the future isn't on their current roster.I went 11-5 straight up and 9-6-1 against the spread last week with my NFL picks. That takes my straight-up record to 133-60-1 and my ATS record to 100-93-1.The ship has been righted.With 14 games this week -- a lot of them key ones in the playoff races -- let's see if I can stay hot.Bet NFL Week 14 games and NFL odds at DraftKings, where new users who win a $5 wager get $300 in bonus bets and three free months of NBA League Pass.Dallas Cowboys (+3) at Detroit LionsThursday, 8:15 p.m. ET on Prime Video\nThis is a playoff game. Both teams need it in the worst way. Dallas has come alive the past two weeks, while the Lions have been leaking oil. The Cowboys offense should be able to move the football here, while the improved Dallas defense will be able to limit the Lions late to win it. It's close, but the Cowboys take it.Pick: Cowboys 34, Lions 33 | Odds via DraftKings SportsbookCincinnati Bengals at Buffalo Bills (-5.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nJoe Burrow being back has brought life to the Bengals. They can't afford another loss, but beating the Bills on the road will be tough to do. The Bills ran it right at the Steelers for over 240 yards and will do the same here. The Bengals will have trouble stopping the run as the Bills control the ball and Josh Allen hits some timely throws.Pick: Bills 27, Bengals 20 | Odds via Caesars SportsbookIndianapolis Colts at Jacksonville Jaguars (+1.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThe Colts have lost three of four and they now trail the Jaguars in the AFC South race. The Colts haven't won in Jacksonville since 2014, which is hard to believe. The Colts love to run the ball, but the Jaguars are No. 1 in run defense. That will put it on Daniel Jones, who is limited with a broken fibula. I don't think he can win it , while Trevor Lawrence will make plays against the Sauce Gardner-less defense. Jaguars win it.  Pick: Jaguars 21, Colts 17 | Odds via BetMGMMiami Dolphins at New York Jets (+2.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThe Dolphins are somehow still alive in the playoff chase, while the Jets have won three of their last five games. The Dolphins haven't played well in the cold and this could be one of those games. The Jets have played better on defense lately and the offense has shown some signs of life. The defense will keep it close as they win it.  Pick: Jets 24, Dolphins 20 | Odds via FanDuel SportsbookNew Orleans Saints (+8.5) at Tampa Bay BuccaneersSunday, 1 p.m. ET CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThe Saints are playing consecutive road games in Florida after losing to the Dolphins last week. They showed fight in that game and they seem to always show it against the Bucs. But this Tampa Bay team is pushing for a playoff spot. That matters. The Bucs win it behind a big game by their running attack.

Both teams are coming off bad losses, both at home. Neither team is playing well, but the Ravens are playing a little better. The Steelers have major defensive issues. Look for a big game by Derrick Henry as the Ravens win it behind a big rushing performance.  Pick: Ravens 27, Steelers 14 | Odds via DraftKings SportsbookSeattle Seahawks (-7.5) at Atlanta FalconsSunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThis is a long trip for Seattle, but the Seahawks are playing a team that is playing for nothing. That matters. The Seattle defense is really good and will travel well here and cause problems for Kirk Cousins. Sam Darnold hits a few deep shots too. Seattle wins it.Pick: Seahawks 27, Falcons 16 | Odds via FanDuel SportsbookTennessee Titans at Cleveland Browns (-4.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThis is the dog game of the day, but it does feature two quarterbacks from the 2025 draft class in Cam Ward and Shedeur Sanders. Both have done some good and bad things. The Browns defense is much better than what Sanders will face. Look for the Browns to win it behind that defense.  Pick: Browns 20, Titans 10 | Odds via Caesars SportsbookWashington Commanders at Minnesota Vikings (+1.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThese two are among the biggest disappointments this season. The Vikings will have J.J. McCarthy back at quarterback, but it will be Marcus Mariota again for the Commanders. The Vikings have the better defense, which will be the difference here.  Pick: Vikings 24, Commanders 17 | Odds via BetMGMDenver Broncos (-7.5) at Las Vegas RaidersSunday, 4:05 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThe Broncos are playing consecutive road gams, but it doesn't matter here. The Raiders offense is awful and the line is even worse. The Broncos' defensive front will dominate this game and get turnovers that lead to short fields. The Broncos will keep rolling.  Pick: Broncos 31, Raiders 14 | Odds via FanDuel SportsbookChicago Bears at Green Bay Packers (-6.5)Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThis is an enormous game in the NFC North. The Bears lead the division and are coming off an impressive road victory over the Eagles, while the Packers beat up the Lions on the road. This is Ben Johnson vs. the Packers defense in terms of the key matchup. But I think it will be a Jordan Love game. He stays hot and the Packers win it.  Pick: Packers 28, Bears 20 | Odds via FanDuel SportsbookLos Angeles Rams (-8) at Arizona CardinalsSunday, 4:25 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Rams are playing consecutive road games, although this is a short trip. They will be focused here after losing to the Panthers in a big upset last week. Look for Matthew Stafford to bounce back in a big way. The Cardinals have lost a lot of close games. This won't be one of them.  Pick: Rams 34, Cardinals 20 | Odds via BetMGMHouston Texans at Kansas City Chiefs (-3.5)Sunday, 8:20 p.m. ET on NBC \nThis is a playoff game for these two. Loser has major problems and likely won't make it. The Texans are also playing consecutive road games. But that defense is impressive. Even so, give me the Chiefs and Patrick Mahomes to stay alive in a game they have to have.  Pick: Chiefs 23, Texans 17 | Odds via DraftKings SportsbookPhiladelphia Eagles (-3) at Los Angeles ChargersMonday, 8:15 p.m. ET on ESPN/ABC (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Eagles are coming off a horrible home loss to the Bears where they were mauled in the run game. The Chargers won last week, but quarterback Justin Herbert injured his non-throwing hand. That has to impact him some this week. I think the Eagles will get back on track here against a bad Chargers offensive line and the Philly run game will get going. Pick: Eagles 26, Chargers 20 | Odds via BetMGM\n            ",

    "body": "\n        There was a major change in the latest set of College Football Playoff Rankings, as Texas A&M dropped out of the top four to No. 7 following its loss to Texas in the final full weekend of the regular season. The Aggies' drop allowed Texas Tech to climb into the top four at No. 4. Georgia also climbed one spot to No. 3 while Ohio State and Indiana remain No. 1 and No. 2, respectively. That wasn't the only notable development in Tuesday's rankings, though. Notre Dame slipped one spot to No. 10 after sitting at nine for several weeks. Alabama leapfrogged the Fighting Irish after closing its season with a narrow 27-20 victory against in-state rival Auburn. The Crimson Tide can cement their status in Saturday's SEC Championship Game clash against Georgia, while Notre Dame -- as an independent -- left its last impression on the selection committee in Week 14. It looks like Ole Miss will be unaffected by coach Lane Kiffin's departure for LSU. The Rebels still rank sixth, which gives them homefield advantage on the projected College Football Playoff bracket. Retaining most of the remaining coaching staff through the postseason at least likely helped Ole Miss' outlook. \nTulane remained as the highest-ranked Group of Five school at No. 20, which would give the Green Wave the No. 12 seed in the projected bracket. Virginia would sit at the 11-seed if it's able to take care of business against Duke in the ACC Championship Game. \n                                                                    CBS Sports design\n                                                            Keep an eye on James Madison James Madison made its College Football Playoff Rankings debut after capping an 11-1 regular season with a 59-10 win against Coastal Carolina. The Dukes, who went undefeated in conference play, will face off against Troy in the Sun Belt Conference Championship Game Friday. That's a potentially huge spot for the Dukes. They'll need some help, but the path to the playoff is there. If Virginia loses in the ACC Championship Game, that would seemingly open one of the five automatic bids. It's hard to imagine a five-loss Duke team vaulting over the likes of James Madison. \nSo there's a scenario where two Group of Five teams make the College Football Playoff. The assumption is that the winner of the American Conference -- either No. 20 Tulane or No. 24 North Texas -- will get an automatic bid no matter what happens. \n        \n            \n                College Football Playoff Rankings reaction: Why James Madison at No. 25 could spell disaster for the ACC\n                \n                    Shehan Jeyarajah                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nNotre Dame on the ropes? Though Notre Dame fell just one spot to No. 10, that's a very significant development. It means the Fighting Irish are now the last team to make the field with an at-large bid. That's bubble territory. Since Notre Dame doesn't play in a conference title game this week, it technically cannot control its own fate anymore. The Fighting Irish are likely cheering for No. 4 Texas Tech in the Big 12 Championship Game. If No. 11 BYU wins the Big 12 title, there's a strong chance that it supplants Notre Dame as a champion while Texas Tech falls to an at-large spot -- leaving no room for the Fighting Irish. \n            ",

    "body": "\nWeek 13 was tough for favorites, with the Chiefs, Ravens, Eagles and Rams notably losing to seemingly inferior opponents. However, if you tailed SportsLine expert Jeff Hochman's favorites money line parlay for Week 13 you did not get hurt by any of those upsets. On the flip side, more underdogs winning means the potential for the underdog money line parlay to also be a factor as the 2025 NFL regular season nears its conclusion.If you're looking to get into parlay betting and NFL betting for Week 14, you need to see what Hochman has to say. He's put together two money line parlays for Week 14, with one featuring only favorites on the money line and the other featuring only underdogs.Week 14 NFL money line favorites parlay\nBetting heavy favorites can be a solid strategy if you want to bet on a 3-team NFL money line parlay. This approach focuses on teams with odds of -150 or better, which means you lean towards high-probability outcomes. By pairing three teams that usually have odds between -150 and -350 or even higher, you're not only aiming for consistent, modest returns, but you're also stacking the deck in your favor for a higher chance of winning. Remember that you can still parlay a favorite with odds of -140 or less to avoid laying 2.5 points, which can significantly impact your chances of winning. Remember, you have to win all three legs for a successful wager.According to BetMGM data, NFL moneyline favorites at -115 or shorter posted a 68% win percentage in 2023, with a 66.5% rate in 2022. Over the six-season period from 2018-2024, NFL moneyline favorites maintained a 66.6% win rate (1,013-508-7). The strength of favorites correlates directly with their odds. In sports betting, if you see teams with odds between -150 and -200, they generally have a solid chance of winning, with around a 60-65% success rate. Teams that are even bigger favorites, with odds from -250 to -400, tend to be more reliable, showing win rates of about 70% to 80%. The 2024 NFL season stood out for favorites, with an overall win rate hitting 71.8%.In Week 13, NFL betting favorites faced challenges, finishing with a record of 9 wins and 7 losses, with four of those defeats occurring on Thursday and Friday. So far this season, favorites have won 133 of 193 games, for an overall success rate of 68.9%. What does this imply for Week 14? Will the favorites continue to dominate as they did on Sunday and Monday? Take a look at Jeff's top moneyline parlays featuring favorites and underdogs.Cleveland Browns over Tennessee TitansI am entirely out on the Titans. Last week was a great spot and they absolutely laid an egg. The Browns should bounce back after some stupid, silly gaffes and coaching decisions last week against the 49ers. Cleveland is ranked ninth in third-down defense, 10th in red zone defense, and 11th in opponent passer rating, far ahead of the Titans. Both teams have flawed offenses but the Browns defense is a real difference-maker.Cleveland is significantly better in every key defensive metric and far ahead at pressuring QBs (Myles Garrett advantage). Tennessee's offense and offensive line are the NFL's worst by most advanced metrics. Both offenses average under five yards per play, near-league worst marks, and both teams play at slow paces, so you might want to take a hard look at the Under. The Browns' defensive front (Garrett, Collins, Graham) should dominate the Titans' poor offensive line, creating short fields and third-down stops.My betting model predicts the Browns to win by five points, with an average total of 30 points. Cleveland wins with a final score of 17-13.Kansas City Chiefs over Houston TexansThis is another good spot for the home team to at least get a victory. We have a dome team playing in extreme cold (high in the low 20s). C.J. Stroud played well (19-for-28, 245 yards, 0 TD) in similar conditions in last year's AFC Divisional round, where the Chiefs won 23-14 as 10-point favorites. Houston struggled in the red zone, which could be a problem again, as the Texans rank 31st in red zone scoring, while the Chiefs rank seventh in red zone defense. Kansas City is 2-0 after previously losing two consecutive games this season and will have ten days to prepare for this contest.Houston's top-ranked pass defense, allowing a passer rating of 74.2, creates a challenging situation for Mahomes, as its elite defensive line, ranked sixth in sacks, applies constant pressure. However, the extreme cold weather diminishes many of the Texans' advantages. At 6-6, Kansas City needs to win out. And while I lean toward Houston on the spread at +3.5 or higher, Andy Reid and company will keep their season alive in what should be an electric atmosphere on Sunday Night Football.Philadelphia Eagles over Los Angeles ChargersI love this spot for the Eagles after dropping two in a row. They have played the much more demanding schedule (No. 4 vs. No. 31) and will have extended rest after their defense was on the field for 85 plays and 39:18 possession time. The Eagles have a 12-25 career record in games where right tackle Lane Johnson has not started since the beginning of the 2016 season, including 0-2 in 2025. The stud right tackle could be back for this game but even if he's out, the Eagles have allowed just one sack without Johnson.These two teams are evenly matched with the Eagles sporting a +1.9-point differential and the Chargers a +2.1 but as mentioned above, Los Angeles has played the second-easiest slate. Bo Nix is the best QB the Chargers have played since facing Patrick Mahomes in Week 1. Last week, the Chargers had a +17-point differential while the Eagles were -9. The public will remember what they saw last week and hammer the home team. Be careful. There might be more Eagles fans than Chargers fans present at SoFi Stadium.Justin Herbert, who has a broken left hand, is likely to play and his availability will be a significant factor to watch as the week progresses. The Chargers are set to face the Chiefs next week and have a 3-5 record before playing Kansas City since 2021. It's always scary to fade a short home underdog on MNF. My gut tells me the Eagles are the best option for a money line bet.Week 14 NFL money line underdogs parlay\nA popular option is available if you're willing to take on a bit more risk for a potentially higher reward. Underdog money line parlays offer the largest possible payouts in the NFL betting landscape. Combining three underdogs with odds like +200, +150, and +300 could result in payouts exceeding 20-to-1 or higher. The best part is that, due to the high payouts, underdog parlays can still be profitable even when winning only a small percentage of bets. For example, hitting just one of several large underdog parlays could offset multiple losses and generate overall profit. NFL underdogs have historically outperformed expectations in specific situations, with home underdogs of +2 to +3 winning outright 46-48% of the time.Jacksonville Jaguars over Indianapolis ColtsI can't get over all the injuries to the Colts, including Daniel Jones playing on a gimpy leg, which hinders his running ability. They will utilize Jonathan Taylor, who has gained 1,282 yards but Jacksonville's run defense is elite, allowing only 82.4 yards per game (ranked first in the NFL). The Jaguars don't have to worry about Jones and the read option, which is a significant advantage. Indianapolis is 1-2 in outdoor road games this season and 2-3 against winning teams. They have played an easier schedule (No. 20 vs. No. 8) through Week 13.The Jaguars counter with home-field advantage and special teams superiority. They find ways to win. Jacksonville ranks sixth in special teams while Indianapolis ranks 12th. I think the wrong team is favored, as my model has Jacksonville as a -125 home favorite (-2.1-point spread).New York Jets over Miami DolphinsHave you seen Tua Tagovailoa play when the temperature is below 40 degrees? It has not been pretty. This is a significant fade on a Dolphins team that has won three consecutive games despite being out-gained in two of those matchups, all while playing at home. Miami hits the road after playing four straight home games. This is a revenge game. The Jets lost to Miami 27-21 back in September despite out-gaining them 404-300. It's an excellent spot to fade the fish.The Jets have an elite third-down defense, ranked sixth with 35.7% conversion rate allowed, while Miami's defense ranks 23rd at 41.4%. This structural advantage makes field position critical. This forces Miami to be efficient on early-down offense or face third-and-long situations, which Tagovailoa has struggled with in extreme cold. Tyrod Taylor completed 19 of 33 passes for 172 yards and a touchdown while rushing eight times for 44 yards and a touchdown in Sunday's 27-24 win over the Falcons. I'm comfortable with Taylor under center. New York has the better special teams and could be the difference in what projects to be a tightly contested game.Chicago Bears over Green Bay PackersGreen Bay has dominated the Bears, going 9-1 in the last 10 meetings. The Bears' victory occurred last January 24-22 as 10.5-point road underdogs. Chicago's roster, coaching, and QB play are much better than last year's team, and they have a top-7 third-down offense and defense. This is not a team that lacks potential; Chicago has a real chance to win.The Packers are favored for several reasons as they hold a significant advantage in total DVOA (No. 5 vs. No. 19). While the Packers have a +0.9 net yards per play and the Bears are -0.5, Green Bay could be without several starters on defense. Ben Johnson has been in this division for years and knows how to scheme against Green Bay's defense. Also, extreme cold weather creates high variance. We know division games are ripe for upsets between two winning teams. My model has Green Bay favored by just under 5 points, so getting the Bears at +250 seems like good value.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The current DraftKings promo code gives new users $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins. Thursday features a three-game NBA slate that features LeBron James in action as the Los Angeles Lakers host the Dallas Mavericks at 10 p.m. ET. Although James will play in the NBA All-Star Game, he'll have time to rest after Thursday, which could lead to more minutes and larger usage. With James active and the Mavericks without multiple players, including Cooper Flagg (foot), the SportsLine Projection Model backs the Lakers to cover as 7.5-point favorites as one of its Thursday NBA best bets at DraftKings. The over/under for Lakers vs. Mavericks is 235.5, the highest total on Thursday's NBA odds board. The model is also backing the Oklahoma City Thunder to cover as 13.5-point favorites against the Milwaukee Bucks in a 7:30 p.m. ET matchup that will not feature Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (abdominal) or Giannis Antetokounmpo (calf). One of SportsLine's top experts has also locked in a college basketball bet for Northern Iowa vs. Belmont at 9 p.m. ET. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every NBA game 10,000 times and has returned well over $10,000 in betting profit for $100 players on its top-rated NBA picks over the past eight-plus seasons. The model enters the week before the NBA All-Star break on a sizzling 38-17 roll on top-rated NBA spread picks dating back to last season. Anyone following its NBA betting advice at sportsbooks and on betting apps could have seen huge returns.Thursday best bets at DraftKings SportsbookThunder (-13.5) vs. Bucks (-112)Northern Iowa (+5.5) vs. Belmont (-118)Lakers (-7.5) vs. Mavericks (-112)Combining the three picks into a Thursday parlay at DraftKings would result in a payout of +541 (risk $100 to win $541). Bet it at DraftKings here: (Odds subject to change):\nThunder (-13.5) vs. Bucks (-112)The Thunder certainly aren't the same team without Shai Gilgeous-Alexander in the lineup, but they are still 3-2 over their five games with the reigning NBA MVP out with an abdominal injury. They've won two of those three games by at least 27 points, with an average margin of victory of 24 points in the three wins. Oklahoma City is coming off a 136-109 win over the Suns on Wednesday to improve to 42-13 this season. Meanwhile, the Bucks are 4-4 in their eight games with Giannis Antetokounmpo out, but 1-3 against teams with a winning record. The model projects the Thunder to cover in 64% of simulations. Back the Thunder to cover at DraftKings here:Northern Iowa (+5.5) vs. Belmont (-118)\"Belmont saw its nine-game win streak snapped in an OT loss at Bradley, and now the Bruins return home to face a Northern Iowa team they dismantled by 13 in Cedar Falls,\" SportsLine expert Larry Hartstein said. \"But Northern Iowa is playing much better now. The Panthers just destroyed Murray State, the MVC's second-place team, 89-60 on the road, for their third straight win. None of Northern Iowa's last four opponents has scored more than 60 points. While the Bruins are highly efficient offensively, the Panthers hold opponents to 26.5 percent from deep. Northern Iowa has been an underdog six times this season. The Panthers have covered five of those -- the miss coming by 1.5 points at Bradley -- and beaten market expectations by an average of 8.2 points.\" Back Northern Iowa to cover at DraftKings here:Lakers (-7.5) vs. Mavericks (-112)This Dallas Mavericks lineup is certainly not what NBA fans expected to see on display at the start of the season. The Mavericks still haven't seen Kyrie Irving this season, who remains out with a knee injury. They traded away Anthony Davis. And now, No. 1 pick Cooper Flagg, who has dominated lately, is out with a foot injury. The Lakers aren't at full strength either, with Luka Doncic (hamstring) out, but only Doncic and Deandre Ayton (knee, questionable) are on the LA injury report. Meanwhile, Dallas has eight players on its injury report as either questionable, doubtful or out. LeBron James should be additionally rested, as he hasn't played since Monday, and could take on a larger role with the upcoming break. The Lakers are 32-21 compared to the Mavericks at 19-34 this season, and the model projects the Lakers to cover in 67% of simulations.\" Back the Lakers to cover at DraftKings here:\nWant more NBA, college basketball picks on Thursday?You've seen some of the model's Thursday best bets.

It's been a rousing success thus far. The Americans rolled to a perfect 4-0-0-0 record in the preliminary round, including a blowout win over rival Canada, and they will now face Italy in the quarterfinals.Team USA entered this tournament as the gold medal favorite, and it has looked the part through four games. The Americans outscored preliminary round opponents 20-1, and they've won three consecutive games by a score of 5-0. Caroline Harvey is tied for the tournament lead with seven points, and Alex Carpenter has found the back of the net in each game.\n        \n            \n                2026 Winter Olympics medal count: Keep track of Team USA's quest for gold in Italy\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAs a result of that dominance, the U.S. has earned the top seed in the knockout round, and it will face No. 8 seed Italy. Unlike the five teams in Group A, the Italians had to earn a top-three spot in Group B to reach the quarterfinals. The team representing the home nation came up with wins over France and Japan and finished the preliminary round 2-0-0-2, which was good enough for six points and the final spot in the knockout round.The quarterfinal matchups are win-or-go-home games as the tournament shifts to a single elimination format the rest of the way. Teams will be re-seeded according to the standings prior to the semifinals. The U.S. women's hockey team has never fallen short of the semifinals at the Olympics, and this year's team is heavily favored to reach the medal round again.Below is everything you need to know about how to watch Team USA's quarterfinal clash with Italy, as well as how they got here.U.S. women's hockey Olympic scheduleAll times EasternPreliminary roundThursday, Feb. 5: USA 5, Czechia 1 Saturday, Feb. 7: USA 5, Finland 0Monday, Feb. 9: USA 5, Switzerland 0Tuesday, Feb. 10: USA 5, Canada 0QuarterfinalUSA vs. Italy | Friday, Feb. 13 | 3:10 p.m. | USA NetworkSemifinalTBD vs. TBD | Monday, Feb. 16 | 10:40 a.m. | TBDBronze medal game\nTBD vs. TBD | Thursday, Feb. 19 | 8:40 a.m. | TBDGold medal gameTBD vs. TBD | Thursday, Feb. 19 | 1:10 p.m. | TBD\n            \n    ",

Team USA had to shake off the rust before wearing down the Latvians over the final two periods in a dominant effort.The opening 20 minutes weren't terribly impressive as the U.S. and Latvia went into the first intermission tied at 1-1. Team USA had two goals overturned due to coach's challenges, and it hit three posts while also making some uncharacteristic mistakes.The U.S. turned up the heat right from the opening puck drop of the second period, and it was all Team USA in the final 40 minutes. The Americans had the Latvians running around in their own zone for the entire second period, and Brock Nelson managed to bury a couple of goals.\nNelson was one of the game's standouts with his two goals, but Jack Hughes and Quinn Hughes (two assists each) were also littered throughout the scoresheet. Another positive for the Americans was the chemistry between Matthew and Brady Tkachuk as the brothers combined to open the scoring.There was a lot to like about Team USA's game, especially the last two periods. The passing got cleaner as the game progressed, the power play tallied two goals and the forecheck was extremely effective. This won't be the Americans' biggest test of the tournament, but it was a good start nonetheless.The Americans will try to build upon this strong start when they face Denmark in their second of three preliminary round games.\nU.S. men's hockey scheduleAll times EasternPreliminary roundThursday, Feb. 12: USA 5, Latvia 1USA vs. Denmark | Saturday, Feb. 14 | 3:10 p.m. | USA NetworkUSA vs. Germany | Sunday, Feb. 15 | 3:10 p.m. | USA NetworkQuarterfinalTBD vs. TBD | Wednesday, Feb. 18 | 3:10 p.m. | TBDSemifinalTBD vs. TBD | Friday, Feb. 20 | 3:10 p.m. | TBDBronze medal game\nTBD vs. TBD | Saturday, Feb. 21 | 2:10 p.m. | TBDGold medal gameTBD vs. TBD | Sunday, Feb. 22 | 8:10 a.m. | TBD\n            \n    ",

Utah carried a seven-point lead into the fourth quarter against Orlando, yet fell, 120-117. The Jazz were up three points entering the final quarter against the Heat, but pulled out a 115-111 victory. The Pacers on the other hand were fined $100,000 for violating the Player Participation Policy during a Feb. 3 matchup against the Jazz. An investigation revealed that star forward Pascal Siakam and two other starters who did not play could have participated under the medical standard in the policy. In its press release, the NBA said the Pacers could have held the players out of other games that would have been in compliance with its policy.\"Overt behavior like this that prioritizes draft position over winning undermines the foundation of NBA competition and we will respond accordingly to any further actions that compromise the integrity of our games,\" NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement.  \"Additionally, we are working with our Competition Committee and Board of Governors to implement further measures to root out this type of conduct.\"\nEntering Thursday night, the 18-37 Jazz ranked third-worst in the West, while the 15-40 Pacers ranked second-worst in the East. Both teams are far outside of playoff contention and will be in the NBA Draft lottery, however, each of the three worst teams in the league have a 14% chance to win the top pick and currently the Pacers are fourth-worst and the Jazz are sixth-worst overall.\n            \n    ",

Now, he wants to come back to the UFC to claim it.Diaz has not competed in mixed martial arts since beating Tony Ferguson in September 2022. He parlayed his success into a big-ticket boxing match with Jake Paul. More than three years after leaving the UFC, Diaz is planning a comeback.\"Let's  not act like I didn't start a whole division bringing value to all  these guys claiming they're it,\" Diaz wrote on Twitter. \"I gave  opportunities and put notice on the dopest fights. I got unfinished  business, and I plan on going and taking what's mine ASAP. First to ever  start a division and the dopest one at that.\"Diaz was referencing the symbolic BMF title, currently held by Max Holloway. Diaz proposed the creation of the title, which emphasizes an elite action style, while proclaiming himself as \"the baddest motherf---er in the game\" at UFC 241.\"Jorge Masvidal had a good last fight,\" Diaz said after beating Anthony Pettis in 2019. \"There are no gangsters in this game anymore. No one can get it right other than me and him. I know he's a gangster, but he's no West Coast gangster.\"\nDiaz and Masvidal fought for the inaugural BMF title at UFC 244. The welterweight fight headlined the promotion's return to Madison Square Garden in New York City. Masvidal defeated Diaz by third-round doctor stoppage and was awarded the BMF title by Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson.'Lightweights Justin Gaethje and Dustin Poirier fought for the vacant BMF title shortly after Masvidal retired. Gaethje knocked out Poirier with a second-round head kick to claim the title. At UFC 300, former featherweight champion Max Holloway moved up to lightweight to challenge Gaethje. Holloway claimed the BMF title with a buzzer-beater punch that was awarded CBS Sports' 2024 Knockout of the Year. \"You're welcome motherf---ers,\" Diaz said in his post. \"I'll see you soon. I'm coming.\"\nExpect Diaz to keep a close eye on UFC 326. On March 7, Holloway defends the BMF title against former lightweight champion Charles Oliveira. The numbered event, streaming exclusively on Paramount+, takes place in Las Vegas.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        UFC is deep into planning mode for an unparalleled spectacle. The mixed martial arts leader will host a fight card from the White House this summer. Fans have questions and the UFC is beginning to reveal some details for the historic event.Last year, President Trump proposed a UFC event at the White House as part of America's 250th celebration on for the Fourth of July. One month later, UFC president and CEO Dana White confirmed the promotion would indeed produce the unique event. Nearly every major name in the sport has expressed interest in fighting at the White House. Fan speculation is running rampant about what the card will look like.Take a look below at everything you need to know about the upcoming UFC White House card.When will the UFC White House card take place?The card is tentatively scheduled for June 14, coinciding with President Trump's 80th birthday. The President originally pitched the card for Independence Day before it moved to June. UFC has not confirmed a start time. Currently, main cards for numbered events begin at 9 p.m. ET, while most Fight Nights stateside start at 8 p.m. ET.\nWhat will the event look like?Fighters will walk from the Oval Office to the Octagon. The Octagon will be erected on the South Lawn. White expects fewer than 5,000 spectators to attend, citing security concerns. In February, Ari Emmanuel, CEO of TKO Group Holdings, UFC's parent company, estimated 3,000 to 4,000 spectators on the South Lawn. White proposed setting up large screens at nearby The Ellipse Park, which can accommodate up to 85,000 fans. \"We have this video rendering of what this looks  like,\" White explained. \"We literally have the trees in the South Lawn, so we'll know  exactly where the sun is until it sets. All the logistics are done.\"\nWho is fighting at the White House?No fights have been announced yet for the White House. White and matchmakers met in the second week of February to start putting the card together. Emmanuel speculated that there would be six or seven fights total on the card in an interview with Pat McAfee. Many fighters have expressed their desire to fight on the card. Conor McGregor rejoined the UFC drug testing pool in preparation for a potential return. More recently, UFC welterweight champion Islam Makhachev proposed a super fight with lightweight champion Ilia Topuria. The promotion will likely start rolling out a fight card over the next few months.\n            ",

Just a day after the San Antonio Spurs agreed to release him, Sochan plans to sign with the New York Knicks for the remainder of the season after he clears waivers, ESPN's Shams Charania is reporting.Sochan, 22, was the No. 9 overall pick out of Baylor in 2022, back when the Spurs were very much in a rebuilding mode. At times placed into a sort of point-forward role as a developmental project with defensive promise, Sochan showed glimpses but generally struggled to find consistency. He averaged 11.0 points on 43% shooting as a rookie and 11.6 points on 44% shooting in his second season.\n        \n            \n                NBA standings predictions: Projecting 1-15 in each conference with two months left in regular season\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLast year, he had his most efficient season, scoring 11.4 points per game on 54% shooting. But persistent perimeter shooting woes -- he's a career 29% 3-point shooter -- came to a head this year, especially with rookie Carter Bryant's emergence. Sochan appeared in just 28 games (zero starts) for the Spurs this season, averaging 12.8 minutes and 4.1 points. He appeared in just two of San Antonio's last 12 games before his release.The Knicks targeted the 6-foot-8 Sochan at the trade deadline but couldn't get a deal done, per SNY's Ian Begley. Given his defensive versatility and athleticism, he could end of figuring into New York's rotation, even for just certain matchups. Even if he doesn't, New York is in essence simply taking a flyer for a young player with upside; Charania reported Sochan had 10 potential suitors.\nNew York is 35-20 this season, third in the East and a half-game behind the Boston Celtics for second. The Knicks also added defensive-minded guard Jose Alvarado at the trade deadline.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\nThirty-two teams resume play in the FA Cup this weekend as fourth round action gets underway, the pack of clubs left standing led by some of the Premier League's finest as the competition to lift England's most historic trophy continues.Premier League giants Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City will take on lower division sides as they target a spot in the quarterfinals, while a handful of competitive matches also await. Two all-Premier League matchups make up the 16 games on the slate, with Liverpool set to take on Brighton and Hove Albion and Aston Villa to square off against Newcastle United. A handful of Championship teams will also face off against one another, including Wrexham's match against Ipswich Town in a battle between two teams chasing promotion to the top flight and a fixture between Norwich City and West Bromwich Albion.The list of contenders for the trophy is led by 14 Premier League clubs, most of the top flight's 20 teams making it through the third round unscathed. One notable exception are reigning champions Crystal Palace, who were ousted in a historic upset by a non-league side last month.Here's what you need to know about the next round of action before tuning in.FA Cup fourth round TV scheduleAll times U.S./EasternFriday, Feb. 13Hull City vs. Chelsea, 2:45 p.m. (ESPN2)Wrexham vs. Ipswich Town, 2:45 p.m. (ESPN Select)Saturday, Feb. 14Burton Albion vs. West Ham United, 7:15 a.m. (ESPN Select)Southampton vs. Leicester City, 10 a.m. (ESPN Select)Burnley vs. Mansfield Town, 10 a.m. (ESPN Select)Norwich City vs. West Bromwich Albion, 10 a.m. (ESPN Select)Port Vale vs. Bristol City, 10 a.m. (ESPN Select)Manchester City vs. Salford City, 10 a.m. (ESPN Select)Aston Villa vs. Newcastle United, 12:45 p.m. (ESPN Select)Liverpool vs. Brighton and Hove Albion, 3 p.m. (ESPN Select)Sunday, Feb. 15Birmingham City vs. Leeds United, 7 a.m. (ESPN)Grimsby Town vs. Wolverhampton Wanderers, 8:30 a.m. (ESPN Select)Oxford United vs. Sunderland, 9 a.m. (ESPN Select)Stoke City vs. Fulham, 9 a.m. (ESPN Select)Arsenal vs. Wigan Athletic, 11:30 a.m. (ESPN Select)Monday, Feb. 16Macclesfield Town vs. Brentford, 2:45 p.m. (ESPN Select)Macclesfield Town, the last non-league team standingThere will be one clear underdog heading into the fourth round -- Macclesfield Town, the only non-league team remaining in the competition. They have already made history by beating Crystal Palace 2-0 in the third round, becoming the first non-league side to knock out the reigning champions since Palace themselves did it in the 1908-09 season. The challenge of advancing in the FA Cup does not get any easier from here, though. They next face Premier League side Brentford, who are in the midst of an impressive first season under coach Keith Andrews. The Bees are in the hunt to qualify for European competition for the first time in their history and are not all that far off from the UEFA Champions League berths, arguably making them one of the most formidable challengers for the FA Cup left.A different type of Manchester derbyManchester City, meanwhile, return to play in the FA Cup with a favorable matchup against League Two side Salford City in a local tie against a team from the Greater Manchester area -- and one owned by a batch of ex-Manchester United players. City will naturally go into this match as the heavy favorites, their might on display when they beat Salford 8-0 in FA Cup third round action last year. Pep Guardiola's side, though, also seem to have a new lease on life after a come-from-behind win against Liverpool last weekend, perhaps providing them additional incentive to come out with a win as they look to win their first trophy in two seasons. Considering the favorable circumstances, expect Guardiola to rotate through his options but considering City have several quality attackers at their disposal, the team selection may offer little reprieve for Salford.Liam Rosenior's Hull City returnChelsea have a chance to bounce back from a midweek draw against Leeds United when they return to FA Cup action on Friday, opening up the fourth round slate with a trip to Hull City. It marks a homecoming of sorts for new Blues coach Liam Rosenior, who cut his managerial teeth during a two year stint with Hull -- and offers a chance for him to prove his worth in the early weeks of his tenure at Chelsea. Rosenior inherited a team that won two trophies last season under his predecessor Enzo Maresca, the UEFA Conference League title in which a young team announced themselves and the FIFA Club World Cup title in which they proved they could contend with some of Europe's best on any given day. Rosenior, though, has also joined a team with a sputtering attack, epitomized by Cole Palmer's big miss against Leeds as a dry spell in front of goal continues. Friday's game at Hull may not offer any revealing answers on that front, but Rosenior's big task is still getting the best out of Palmer, and perhaps picking up silverware along the way in the short-term.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        After an offseason of trade speculation, the Philadelphia Phillies are cutting ties with Nick Castellanos. Castellanos has been released, the team announced Thursday. The Phillies will owe him his $20 million salary this season minus the prorated portion of the $780,000 league minimum if/when he signs with another club.Castellanos, 34 next month, is coming off a career-worst season in 2025. He hit .240/.294/.400 with 17 home runs and bumped heads with manager Rob Thomson at times. On Thursday, Castellanos admitted to bringing a beer into the dugout after being removed from a game last June. Add in right field defense that borders on unplayable, and Castellanos was a minus-0.6 WAR player in 2025. All told, he put up only plus-0.8 WAR in four seasons with the Phillies. POBO Dave Dombrowski indicated the Phillies would look to move Castellanos at the outset of the offseason, though his salary and declining production made that difficult.  The Phillies waited as long as possible -- position players report to camp Monday -- to see whether a team would take on even a small part of Castellanos' salary in a trade, which didn't happen. That was always going to be a challenge. It was clear the Phillies were ready to move on. Interested teams knew he would be available as a free agent eventually. \nPhiladelphia signed Adolis García to a one-year, $10 million contract earlier in the offseason to replace Castellanos. They are similar hitters with power and plate discipline issues, though García is a much better defender. If nothing else, he will be an enormous defensive upgrade in right field. Thomson's regular lineup will look something like this: SS Trea Turner, RHBDH Kyle Schwarber, LHB1B Bryce Harper, LHB3B Alec Bohm, RHBLF Brandon Marsh (LHB) and Otto Kemp (RHB)RF Adolis García, RHB2B Bryson Stott, LHBC J.T. Realmuto, RHBCF Justin Crawford, LHBOnce he clears release waivers, Castellanos will be free to sign with any team for the prorated minimum. The San Diego Padres were said to have interest in Castellanos in the offseason, though they recently signed Miguel Andujar to be their DH. The Toronto Blue Jays could show interest after losing Anthony Santander to shoulder surgery, though George Springer is locked in as the designated hitter. Non-contenders like the Chicago White Sox and Washington Nationals might be Castellanos' best shot at a job in the short-term. The better move would be waiting until spring training games get underway and seeing whether injuries create any needs league-wide. Right now, it doesn't appear there would be much demand for a sub-replacement level DH. \nThe Phillies went 96-66 and won the NL East last season, then were eliminated by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLDS. Castellanos started three of the four NLDS games and went 2 for 15 in the series. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        A new era of Pac-12 football is near with the rebuilt conference set to debut this fall. The eight-team league announced its 2026 schedule on Wednesday, which features a round-robin slate and a unique \"flex\" matchup for each team in Week 13. That flex week could prove instrumental in determining the College Football Playoff picture as the Pac-12 seeks to establish itself as the preeminent Group of Six league and send one of its members to the 12-team tournament.The modest size of the reimagined Pac-12 creates a reality in which teams cannot play more than seven conference games. Maintaining a three-game nonconference slate with a bye week leaves one unclaimed date on each squad's schedule, and it is with that open slot that the Pac-12 will introduce the flex games.The flex week introduces one repeat matchup per team. Every program will play a Pac-12 team it faced earlier in the year, but importantly, the Week 13 rematch will not count towards conference standings. Last year effectively provided a trial run of this format, as Oregon State and Washington State played a home-and-home wherein the first game counted as an official Pac-12 contest and the second was a non-conference battle.Here is everything we know about the Pac-12 flex week and what it could mean for the conference's CFP outlook.\nFlex week gives Pac-12 unique advantage in CFP raceAs with every other Group of Six conference, the Pac-12 aims to produce one of the five highest-ranked league champions in college football to secure an automatic bid into the CFP. Pairing two former power conference programs in Oregon State and Washington State with five top-flight Mountain West schools and a rising Sun Belt contender gives this league a bevy of potential playoff hopefuls.The flex week allows the Pac-12 to assess late in the season which of its teams have the most realistic paths to the CFP and to dynamically adjust their schedules to increase their odds of earning berths.Say Boise State stands at No. 15 in the CFP rankings in mid-November and that no other Group of Six teams are in the top 25. The Pac-12 could hand the Broncos a highly winnable matchup in the flex week to ensure they remain undefeated.\nOr perhaps Fresno State is in a battle with teams from the American and Sun Belt and needs a marquee win to set itself apart. The conference could pit the Bulldogs against the second-best team in the league in hopes that they win and boost their profile.Furthermore, since the flex game is a nonconference matchup, the top two teams in the league can lose in Week 13 and still participate in the Pac-12 Championship Game. That offers some margin for error where a highly regarded team could still qualify for the CFP as a conference champion even with a late-season loss.Pac-12 flex week stipulationsWhile the Pac-12 has complete authority over which teams play which in Week 13, it still must abide by one key rule with regard to game locations. That is, teams are guaranteed at least six home games in total and four against conference opponents. Since half of the league will only play three conference home games, the other half is guaranteed to play at home during the flex week.\nColorado State, Fresno State, Utah State and Washington State will host their flex games regardless of their opponents.Additional considerations could come into play in determining the matchups, but there are no guarantees. The Pac-12 specifically noted in its schedule release that it will attempt to prevent repeat road trips. For example, since Boise State has a road game at Fresno State in Week 6, the league would try not to force the Broncos to play the Bulldogs at Valley Children's Stadium again in Week 13.Projected Pac-12 flex matchupsThe Pac-12 announced four projected matchups for Week 13. These contests follow the aforementioned criterion of no team playing two road games against the same opponent.\nBoise State at Utah StateTexas State at Colorado StateSan Diego State at Fresno StateOregon State at Washington StateIn practice, the conference will likely need to be lenient when it comes to repeat road trips. Any deviation from these projections will almost certainly force at least one team to play a second game in an away stadium.When will Pac-12 flex games be determined?Flex games will be finalized no later than six days ahead of kickoff. That makes Sunday, Nov. 22 the deadline to announce the Week 13 pairings. Matchups could be determined before that date, though.One disadvantage of this deadline is that the Pac-12 must set its flex games prior to the Week 13 CFP Top 25 rankings release. That is less than ideal since the conference aims to use the flex week to better position its playoff contenders, but the Week 12 rankings and results should help the conference to make an informed decision.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        One of the most valuable freshmen in the sport may have played his last game in college.North Carolina announced Thursday afternoon that stellar freshman forward Caleb Wilson suffered a left hand fracture during the first half of the Tar Heels' 75-66 road loss against Miami on Tuesday.\"X-rays taken during the game were negative, and he returned to play later in the second half vs. the Hurricanes, but additional imaging done in Chapel Hill revealed the fracture,\" per the school. \"The evaluation process is ongoing to determine the timetable for Wilson's return.\"Wilson played 26 minutes against Miami, his fewest against a power-conference opponent this season. He also logged a season-low 12 points.\nImpact on UNC's lineupBroken hands can sometimes lead to extended absences, so there is no telling whether or not Wilson will be able to suit up in the near future, or if the injury and subsequent rehab will force him to sit deep into March. Wilson has been one of the best freshman performers in what's increasingly considered the deepest one-and-done class in college basketball history. At 19.8 points and 9.4 rebounds per game, Wilson has doubly proven to be among the best freshmen in Carolina history. His 17 20-point outings are the most by any first-year player for the program. Wilson played all 40 minutes in UNC's instant-epic win over rival Duke on Saturday, scoring 23 points to go with four rebounds, two assists, two steals and a block. North Carolina also notes Wilson's 66 dunks are the most of any player in college basketball. Without Wilson, UNC loses formidable inside defense, scoring, flexibility and recovery. There is no replacing his motor or stamina, either. UNC ranks outside the top 40 in defensive efficiency at KenPom and has relied on Wilson's unrelenting hustle and playmaking to make a jump this season after barely making the 2025 NCAA Tournament. \nUNC has been playing an eight-man rotation for the majority of the year. The Heels' four starters will remain Henri Veesar in the middle, Jarin Stevenson in the frontcourt (likely moving from the 3 and replacing Wilson as the 4-man), veteran shooting guard Seth Trimble and freshman Derek Dixon, a rising star running the point in the backcourt. The most likely tweak to keep UNC with some viable size in its most common lineup will be to inject 6-6 swingman Luka Bogavac into the starting five. The 22-year-old from Montenegro started 13 games earlier in the year.Backup shooting guard Jonathan Powell and point guard Kyan Evans (who's started 17 times) will see their roles increased as well. Everyone else has played spot duty. Can UNC go seven-deep as it turns toward the month-long stretch to Selection Sunday?\nNCAA tourney seed outlook TBDThursday's news makes North Carolina one of the most interesting teams to track over the next month. There's a wide spectrum of outcomes in play because the loss of Wilson will be problematic for a 19-5 Heels crew that is ranked 11th this week but doesn't have an NCAA seed projection that harmonizes with its AP ranking. The Tar Heels are currently hovering between the 6- and 7-line in CBS Sports' most recent NCAA Tournament bracketology outlook. Depending on how the Tar Heels play in the weeks ahead without their most talented player, the committee will evaluate (but not necessarily punish) UNC with and without Wilson. Now, if UNC can win way more often than not without its most vital player, the committee will reward the Heels accordingly. \nThe next game is manageable: UNC hosts lowly Pitt on Saturday, then has back-to-back road tests against North Carolina State and Syracuse. Home games against Louisville and Clemson still await (both are pacing toward healthy tourney seeds) and of course there's the season finale at Duke.An Atlanta native, Wilson projects as a top-five draft prospect. North Carolina hasn't had a player drafted in the top five since Marvin Williams went No. 2 in 2005.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Now that the Super Bowl is over and it's seven long months until NFL action resumes, bettors are left with a couple of options. Some are taking a deep breath, perhaps calculating their profits and losses from the NFL season on a spreadsheet, celebrating or lamenting their luck from Super Bowl 60 wagers and perhaps preparing to turn their attention to another sport for the time being. Others are already exploring what NFL bets for next season they can make now. For this camp, DraftKings Sportsbook already has posted live 2026 NFL future odds for all potential division winners. This option not only provides a needed alternative to Super Bowl futures wagers, which historically are about the only such NFL future offered this time of year, but this market has proven to be a gold mine for NFL handicappers and bettors who have a talent for accurately pegging the projections of teams in the parity-heavy NFL. This past season serves as a prime example of the volatility in the NFL divisional winner futures market. The Philadelphia Eagles (-160) were the only favorite in the eight division races to reward their supporters as they repeated as NFC East champions with an 11-6 record. The seven others featured underdog winners, including two worst-to-first turnarounds. Those milestones were achieved by the New England Patriots (+550), who went from 4-13 to 13-4 on their way to a Super Bowl 60 appearance, where they were drubbed 29-13 by the Seattle Seahawks, and the Chicago Bears (+600), who conquered the talent-rich NFC North at 11-6 in their first season under Ben Johnson and reached the Divisional Round of the playoffs. It stands to reason that this upcoming season will likely feature at least one similar turnaround, and now is the best time to scalp potential value despite the uncertainty surrounding the NFL Draft and free agency that concerns all 32 clubs. However, even if you lean toward playing chalk, the good news is that zero teams come with a hefty price tag. The Eagles (-110) are the only repeat favorites, while the Ravens (-110) and Bills (-115) carry discount price tags to win their respective divisions. The following are the current DraftKings odds for every 2026 NFL division winner: Place NFL futures bets at DraftKings and get bonus bets:AFC East 2026 divisional oddsBuffalo Bills -115New England Patriots +115 New York Jets +2000Miami Dolphins +2000 AFC North 2026 divisional oddsBaltimore Ravens -110 Cincinnati Bengals +210Pittsburgh Steelers +450Cleveland Browns +1200 AFC South 2026 divisional oddsHouston Texans +160  Jacksonville Jaguars +180Indianapolis Colts +350Tennessee Titans +750AFC West 2026 divisional oddsLos Angeles Chargers +175Kansas City Chiefs +175Denver Broncos +210 Las Vegas Raiders +3000 NFC East 2026 divisional oddsPhiladelphia Eagles -110 Dallas Cowboys +475 Washington Commanders +500New York Giants +700 NFC North 2026 divisional oddsDetroit Lions +160 Green Bay Packers +185 Chicago Bears +350 Minnesota Vikings +700 NFC South 2026 divisional oddsTampa Bay Buccaneers +115 New Orleans Saints +340 Atlanta Falcons +400 Carolina Panthers +425 NFC West 2026 divisional oddsLos Angeles Rams +155 Seattle Seahawks +160San Francisco 49ers +250 Arizona Cardinals +5000Initial sleeper/value leans:Here are our initial value/sleeper picks for each NFL division:AFC East, Patriots (+115): Of course, it's an inherent contradiction to call a Super Bowl participant a \"sleeper,\" but we can put the Patriots in the value category. This is one division in which we can safely rule out the massive underdogs and, though it could be a mistake to disrespect Josh Allen and the Bills, we weren't wild about their head-coaching hire in Joe Brady and the embarrassing public fallout amid the firing of former coach Sean McDermott that suggested organizational dysfunction. We'll take the plus-money price on the more stable team that appeared to be at least one year ahead of schedule with its memorable run to the Super Bowl. AFC North, Bengals (+210): For better or worse, Zac Taylor is the lone returning AFC North coach. Quarterback Joe Burrow's late-season return from injury showed that the Cincinnati offense still has immense upside. If the franchise can make the necessary moves to field a simply serviceable defense, the opportunity is there for the Bengals to take advantage of a division that is otherwise filled with transitional franchises. AFC South, Jaguars (+180): In their first year under coach Liam Cohen, the Jags were among the biggest surprises amid their 13-4 finish and playoff appearance. We understand that the elite defensive profile of the Texans, who finished the regular season with nice consecutive wins, is why they are the slight chalk. But as their playoff struggles illustrated, they could be facing a dilemma at quarterback while Trevor Lawrence and friends are likely to take another step forward. AFC West, Chiefs (+170): Last year, the Chiefs experienced regression with their record in close games and saw their season lost amid an injury to quarterback Patrick Mahomes. While this is far from a confident bounce-back spot for a club that has some areas to address, we still like the principle value of backing Mahomes and coach Andy Reid to return to prominence in the tight division, and the price overlay is a lot more enticing than the -250 or so tag that came with them for the past several seasons. NFC East, Giants (+700): The Giants appear to have the most promising profile to follow in the footsteps of the Patriots and Bears for a worst-to-first turnaround. They immediately nabbed the best coach in the division as winners of the John Harbaugh sweepstakes and, with a franchise quarterback in place, a strong defensive line and last-place schedule to feast upon, the needed elements are present. Moreover, the Eagles are shrouded in instability amid a new, unproven offensive coordinator and the uncertain futures of stars such as mercurial wideout A.J. Brown. NFC North, Bears (+350): The Bears appeared to be just hitting their offensive peak as the playoffs approached, and another step forward could make this club as potent as the one Johnson led while he was with the Lions. Their leaky defense is a major concern, but we've often seen one or two personnel changes or an adjustment in scheme make a huge difference for a specific unit. We expect the Lions, who swept the Bears last year, to return to relevance, but the price is nice for backing Chicago to continue its upward trajectory. NFC South, Falcons (+400): This club underachieved relative to its talent level the past two seasons and new coach Kevin Stefanski, who led the Browns to the playoffs in his first year with the franchise, could be poised to exploit the NFL's most vulnerable division. The recent legal troubles of breakout rookie defensive end James Pearce Jr. (he's currently facing five felony charges) is a massive concern for a defense that made major strides last season. Even so, this team should have enough talent to threaten for the NFC South title. NFC West, Seahawks (+160): With all due respect to the possibility of the proverbial Super Bowl hangover, it still stands to reason that the this division will likely come down to a Week 17 or 18 showdown for the Seahawks against the Rams or 49ers. This club has proven to answer the call in such spots under coaching wunderkind Mike Macdonald and, as such, we're tipping our proverbial hats by not fading the Super Bowl champions in their quest to repeat. Sign up with DraftKings and start earning bonus bets today:\n            ",

Team T-Mac has the experience edge over Vince Carter's squad in that the former has the most sophomores, with five second-year players compared to Team Vince having just three. Meanwhile, Melo's team has the reigning Rookie of the Year in Stephon Castle, plus the size edge in 7-foor-2 center Donovan Clingan.\nTeam Vince lacks the caliber of those two squads and has just two players who were top-10 draft picks in V.J. Edgecombe and Egor Demin. Melo's team has four top-5 draft picks, while T-Mac has four top-6 draftees. There's a sheer talent gap between Vince Carter's squad with those two others, and even in an exhibition game like the Rising Stars Challenge, that gulf should be apparent on the scoreboard. See more predictions at SportsLine. How to make 2026 NBA Rising Stars picksBarner has studied the NBA Rising Stars game from every angle and found a critical X-factor that makes one of these teams a must-back on Friday night. See who it is over at SportsLine.Who wins the NBA Rising Stars Challenge 2026, and which critical X-factor do you need to know about? Visit SportsLine now to get Mike Barner's pick for the NBA Rising Stars Challenge 2026, all from the expert who has crushed his NBA picks, and find out.\n2026 NBA Rising Star odds, rostersSee picks at SportsLine.Team Melo (+160)Cooper Flagg (Dallas Mavericks) (out with injury)Ace Bailey (Utah Jazz)Reed Sheppard (Houston Rockets) Stephon Castle (San Antonio Spurs) Dylan Harper (San Antonio Spurs) Jeremiah Fears (New Orleans Pelicans) Donovan Clingan (Portland Trail Blazers) Collin Murray-Boyles (Toronto Raptors)  Team T-Mac (+190) Kon Knueppel (Charlotte Hornets) Kel'el Ware (Miami Heat) Tre Johnson (Washington Wizards) Alex Sarr (Washington Wizards) Ajay Mitchell (Oklahoma City Thunder) Jaylon Tyson (Cleveland Cavaliers) Cam Spencer (Memphis Grizzlies)  Team Vince (+230) VJ Edgecombe (Philadelphia 76ers) Derik Queen (New Orleans Pelicans) Kyshawn George (Washington Wizards) Matas Buzelis (Chicago Bulls) Egor Dёmin (Brooklyn Nets) Cedric Coward (Memphis Grizzlies) Jaylen Wells (Memphis Grizzlies)  Team Austin (+900) Sean East II (Salt Lake City Stars) Ron Harper Jr. (Maine Celtics) David Jones Garcia (Austin Spurs) [injured, will not play*] Yanic Konan Niederhäuser (San Diego Clippers) Alijah Martin (Raptors 905) Tristen Newton (Rio Grande Valley Vipers) Yang Hansen (Rip City Remix) Mac McClung (Chicago Bulls)\n            ",

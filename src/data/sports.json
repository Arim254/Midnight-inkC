    "body": "\n        Midway through the second quarter on Sunday afternoon in Columbia, Raven Johnson sprung a trap. Matched up against Cotie McMahon in the corner, Johnson watched and waited while Ole Miss ran a pick-and-roll up top. Then, just as Kaitlin Peterson picked up her dribble and turned to throw the ball out to McMahon, Johson jumped into the passing lane for a steal and took the ball coast-to-coast for a layup. Johnson's bucket put South Carolina ahead by 11, and the Gamecocks led by double digits the rest of the way en route to a dominant 85-48 win that secured the SEC regular season title for the fifth season in a row. Though Johnson only finished with six points in the victory -- tied for the fifth-highest total for the Gamecocks -- she showed why she deserves to be a first-round pick in the 2026 WNBA Draft. \nJohnson's WNBA stock has fluctuated throughout her time in college. She helped the Gamecocks win the national championship as a redshirt junior in 2024, and drew rave reviews for her defense against Caitlin Clark in the title game. However, she was unable to build on that momentum last season, and after a disappointing campaign on a personal level, she decided to use her extra year of eligibility to return to school rather than turn pro. That proved to be a wise decision. Johnson has bounced back with the best season of her career: 9.8 points, 4.2 rebounds, 5.4 assists and 1.7 steals on 48.7/35.2/84.1 shooting splits. Those aren't gaudy numbers, and Johnson can still be inconsistent as a scorer, as we saw Sunday, but it's everything else that's going to make her a first-round pick. \n\n        \n            \n                2026 WNBA Draft Big Board 1.0: Awa Fam and Olivia Miles stand alone in first tier, UCLA stars dominate top 10\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"I think that Raven Johnson does not get the credit that she should. I think she is the best point guard in the country,\" Ole Miss coach Yolett McPhee-McCuin said Sunday after Johnson's excellent two-way performance, which included seven assists, three steals and just one turnover. Shutting down McMahonJohnson is best known for her defense, so let's start on that side of the ball. She spent most of Sunday shadowing McMahon, Ole Miss's leading scorer and another potential first-round pick in this year's WNBA draft. McMahon entered the game averaging 20.7 points, and was coming off 39- and 25-point performances. Her hot streak came to an abrupt end\nJohnson helped hold McMahon to a season-low two points on 0 of 9 from the field. This was just the second time in McMahon's career that she's played at least 10 minutes and failed to make a shot, and her two points were tied for the third-fewest in her career. Johnson is only 5-foot-9, but she has a 6-foot-2 wingspan, which is a real benefit against bigger players like the 6-foot McMahon. Throughout the game, Johnson got right into McMahon's space and prevented her from getting anything going off the dribble. Here, early in the third quarter, Johnson picks McMahon up fullcourt and forces her to give up the ball early. Because McMahon is only just inside the halfcourt line, her pass to the wing is longer than usual, which gives Ta'Niya Latson time to pick it off. Johnson doesn't get any credit for this turnover in the box score, but she caused it. \nA few possessions later, McMahon doesn't even try to bring the ball up the floor and throws it ahead instead. She gets it back near the top of the key, but Johnson's pressure immediately forces her backwards, and then Johnson pokes the ball away for what should have been another turnover. \n\"I thought our players did a great job, Raven especially,\" South Carolina coach Dawn Staley said of her team's job defending McMahon. \"The first line of that defense was so hard, that took her vision down, that occupied her dribble. Raven's the very best at it.\"Johnson's ability to mirror McMahon's movements and weave around screens also made it difficult for Ole Miss to get McMahon going off the ball. Here, in the second quarter, Johnson fights through traffic to get a deflection on a baseline out of bounds play and forces Ole Miss to take the ball out again in the deep corner. \nThere is no better point of attack defender in this class than Johnson, and as the WNBA leans more into spacing and 3-point shooting over the coming years, that is going to become an even more valuable skill. \"Unafraid of a challenge, is willing -- she knows. Like, she knew she was gonna have to guard Cotie, she knew she was gonna have to guard Mikayla Blakes. She knows she's gonna have to guard our opponents' best perimeter [players], and sometimes small, power forwards,\" Staley said of Johnson's defensive impact. \"We're unafraid to switch if need be because we know Raven's gonna give it her best shot at defending and making it difficult for people. I see it. I don't think she gets credit enough for what she's been doing over her career... She doesn't have the numbers and the steals and the blocks that we look at... If you really look at what makes our team go defensively, it starts and ends with Raven.\"An improved playmakerJohnson's perimeter defense has never been a secret, but there have been questions about her offense. Though she is shooting a career-high 35.2% from 3-point range (on just 2.4 attempts per game), she still offers little as a scorer. Johnson has made real strides as a playmaker, though, and now looks much more like a viable point guard at the next level. \nShe finished with seven assists against Ole Miss and easily could have been in double figures in that category if her teammates had helped her out. Johnson excels in transition, as we saw time and again Sunday. The weight of her passes were excellent and allowed her bigs to catch the ball in stride to either go up and finish or get fouled. This one in the third quarter to Alicia Tournebize stood out. \nShe also showed that she could make high-level passes in the halfcourt, such as this backdoor feed to Tessa Johnson (which should have been converted) and this pocket pass to Madina Okot. \nAdditionally, Johnson only had one turnover on Sunday. She's averaging 1.6 this season and for her career has just 196 turnovers in 3,485 minutes over 143 games. One of the most impressive stats about Johnson's ability to take care of the ball is that she has 42 games without a turnover, and she played 20-plus minutes in 26 of those contests. Would WNBA teams like to see more from Johnson offensively? Sure. In particular, can she become even more consistent from behind the arc to command attention when she doesn't have the ball? But in an expanding league that's already lacking point guard depth, Johnson's ability to run an offense without making mistakes -- combined with her elite defense -- is going to be attractive to teams. \"Raven Johnson is a winner,\" Staley said after South Carolina defeated LSU earlier this month. \"Like, look it up in the dictionary, look it up on your iPhones, Raven Johnson is a winner. She makes plays. Winning plays... She's probably the one that I'll miss the most out of all the players that I've coached.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 PGA Tour season rolled into the iconic Riviera Country Club in Los Angeles for Tiger Woods' tournament, the Genesis Invitational. The second straight signature event of the season put big money on the line for the 50 players who made the cut as the event returned to Riviera following a one-year absence.Collin Morikawa took home $3.6 million in his triumphant return to the winner's circle at Pebble Beach last week, snapping a winless drought of nearly three years, and history was made at the Genesis Invitational, too, as Jacob Bridgeman emerged from a star-studded leaderboard to pick up the first win of his career.There are few better places to pick up a win at this point on the PGA Tour schedule than a signature event, and with eight fewer players in the field this week, most every spot on the leaderboard earned a bit more cash from the $20 million prize pool at the Genesis.Bridgeman will take home $4 million as the Genesis Invitational marked the 10th straight signature event won by a different player. That's a significant departure from 2024 when Scottie Scheffler won four of the eight events on the calendar.\nScheffler was the heavy favorite coming into Riviera, as is the case every week on the PGA Tour, but after barely making the cut, he shot 66-65 over the weekend to finish T12. Rory McIlroy entered the final round six shots back of Bridgeman but ultimately finished one stroke shy of the lead in a tie for second with Kurt Kitayama.Let's take a look at the full breakdown of how much each finishing spot will take home from the 2026 Genesis Invitational. 2026 Genesis Invitational prize money, purseTotal purse: $20 million \n1st: $4,000,000 -- Jacob Bridgeman2nd: $2,200,000 -- Rory McIlroy, Kurt Kitayama3rd: $1,400,0004th: $1,000,000 -- Adam Scott5th: $840,000 -- Aldrich Potgieter6th: $760,000 -- Jake Knapp7th: $700,000 -- Collin Morikawa, Cameron Young, Tommy Fleetwood, Ryan Fox, Xander Schauffele8th: $646,0009th: $600,00010th: $556,00011th: $514,00012th: $472,000 -- Min Woo Lee, Scottie Scheffler, Jordan Spieth, Alex Noren13th: $430,00014th: $389,000 15th: $369,00016th: $349,000 -- Sam Stevens, Pierceson Coody, Akshay Bhatia, Marco Penge17th: $329,00018th: $309,000 19th: $289,000 20th: $269,000 -- Ludvig Åberg, Robert MacIntyre21st: $250,00022nd: $233,000 -- Harris English, Sahith Theegala23rd: $216,00024th: $200,000 -- Shane Lowry, Matt McCarthy, Matt Fitzpatrick, Max Greyserman25th: $184,00026th: $168,00027th: $161,00028th: $154,000 -- Rickie Fowler, Ryan Gerard, Nick Taylor, Hideki Matsuyama, Tony Finau, Aaron Rai29th: $147,000 30th: $140,00031st: $133,00032nd: $126,00033rd: $119,00034th: $114,000 -- Si Woo Kim, Patrick Rodgers, Tom Kim35th: $109,00036th: $104,00037th: $99,000 -- Sami Valimaki, Corey Conners, Max Homa, Patrick Cantlay38th: $94,00039th: $90,00040th: $86,00041st: $82,000 -- Viktor Hovland, Ben Griffin, Wyndham Clark42nd: $78,00043rd: $74,00044th: $70,000 -- Jhonattan Vegas45th: $66,000 -- Ryo Hisatsune, Taylor Pendrith46th: $62,00047th: $58,000 -- Andrew Novak, Drenny McCarthy48th: $56,000 49th: $54,000 -- Matthias Schmid50th: $52,000 -- Sepp Straka, Brian Harman\n            ",

    "body": "\n        LONDON -- The man who turned them down to pursue his boyhood dream, rolling up the Seven Sisters' Road to add two more to the hat trick he scored last time out, Eberechi Eze the playground bully who reveled in the humiliation of the kids from up the road. It is at this moment that we have to deliver that immortal line from Giorgio Chiellini. \"It is the history of the Tottenham.\"What future history books might tell us of this Tottenham team is worryingly unclear at this stage of the season. Spurs shouldn't get relegated. They probably won't. Bookmakers will happily offer you quite a bit of money to put yours on Tottenham going down.Suppose, however, you were looking back in May, trying to explain how a club that takes three-quarters of a billion dollars in revenue has found itself bound for the Championship. What would have been the early warning signs? A hellacious injury crisis. No real sense of an on-field identity after years of muddled recruitment for players whose physical qualities do not offset their technical limitations. A manager in Igor Tudor with no experience of the Premier League, who might have less bounce than a dead cat after beginning his tenure with a hammering at Arsenal's hands.\"I don't know where we are going now,\" was the cry that echoed from the stadium PA at the final whistle. The gags write themselves.\nIt didn't need to end this way, mind. Tottenham hadn't been the better team at halftime but the game was where they would have wanted it. Eze's opener was cancelled out within 24 seconds of the restart, Randall Kolo Muani preying on overplaying by Declan Rice to thunder Spurs into a lead they held at the interval. It felt like dicing with danger when Tottenham's pre-match MC Paul Coyte declared that Arsenal were \"worried, nervous as hell\" but when the visitors had frittered away another lead you could see his point.The next steps looked relatively obvious, repeating the gameplan of the first half. Sit deep, soak up pressure and have a spring on the counter when the opportunity presented itself. Prey on those insecurities that keep rearing their head for Arsenal. It's hardly the Tottenham way but given the talent disparity between Mikel Arteta's side and hosts that have been laid low by a dozen injuries, it would have been a perfectly valid approach.Instead, Spurs played as their manager had been urging them to in the first half, when every time you glanced at the touchline, you could see Tudor gesticulating for his center backs to get up the pitch. He wanted to see Tottenham press up against Arsenal, to engage them in one-on-one duels. When his players did as he wanted, the outcome was disastrous. There was no downturn in the number of progressive passes the Gunners completed, 33 in both halves, a negligible upswing in Arsenal's touches in the opposition third that probably reflects them taking their foot off the gas at 3-1 and only one instant in which Spurs recovered possession in the attacking third.\n\"We wanted to press high but to press high from the back you need to jump,\" said Tudor. \"If you are late, you don't take the ball and run again. We prepared to press high but we didn't take the ball. We didn't take the ball.\"For 45 minutes the Gunners got to play the sort of game they relish on European nights, their build-up players able to brush past physically inferior opponents and advance the ball into acres of space. Viktor Gyokeres has less space in some of the warm up drills than he did when he smacked the ball past Guglielmo Vicario to restore Arsenal's lead.They never looked like ceding it again. Some of that was due to the composure of Eze and the excellent Bukayo Saka, a lot of it was Tottenham pressing ahead with a gameplan they were incapable of implementing. \"Nice to understand where we are,\" was how Tudor put it postmatch. A harsher assessment would follow, that this was a moment to \"look in the mirror\". \nTudor surely didn't understand the cruelty in the following line to a club for whom the term unserious might be best applied. \"What is this goal of this coach, these players, this staff? To become serious.\"\"We need more time to be in the physical moment and situation that we can go strong and take the ball,\" was another of the eye-opening remarks from Tudor. Time is one resource that is rapidly draining in this season. There are 11 Premier League games to go and the table is looking dicey to say the least. The gap to West Ham in 18th is just four points. At full strength Spurs have the talent to ease away from these sides but look at the XI Tottenham named Sunday. Would you definitely take that over Vitor Pereira's?Since the turn of the year, Nuno Espirito Santo's side have gained seven on Spurs, Nottingham Forest five. In that time, they have had a non-penalty of -0.46 per game. Forest's is worse but West Ham's points trajectory looks to be backed up by the data. Meanwhile Spurs' looks altogether too sticky.\n\n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            It will probably all be just about fine. Tudor said he was hopeful of shaving two off his injury list in time for next week's trip to Fulham. Cristian Romero's suspension is up over the international break, though whether his kamikaze temperament is well suited to a relegation scrap is an open question. It shouldn't be too long until Pedro Porro, Destiny Udogie and Kevin Danso are back. The defense can improve. The attack? The inconsistent Mohamed Kudus is a way off and even if James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski play again this season, it is hard to believe they will be anything like the best versions of themselves. Spurs might have added one to their tally of 37 Premier League goals this season but that is off the back of by far the biggest xG overperformance in the league. Tudor will need those long-injured stars to immediately return at the peak of their powers to enliven an attack that barely produces one non-penalty expected goal per game.Framing this as a reality check was an understandable move by Tudor, a high point set by what he termed \"probably the best team now in the world\". It is not the new manager's fault at all but that moment of realization should have come months ago, perhaps the last time Eze and Arsenal were running the goals up against them. Since then a January window has passed by in which pledges of investment resulted in a prospect left back and, in Conor Gallagher, a better version of the sort of up, down low touch midfielder that Spurs were already well stocked with. That is yet another of those touchstones that might be looked back on with such grim \nOf course, the picture might never look as grim as it does when you've just been beaten again by your greatest rivals, inspired by the man who left you in the lurch late in the transfer window. Right now it isn't the gap to Arsenal that matters, it is the one to West Ham and Nottingham Forest.That is looking altogether too close for comfort. Come the season's end it should be just about big enough. While, however, this is still a team that fulfill those essential qualities Chiellini identified eight years ago, you can never be entirely sure that they won't find a way to snare another defeat for themselves.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        In a career that has been filled with memorable moments, Pat Riley made history once again on Sunday by becoming the first Los Angeles Lakers coach to receive a statue. Riley, who has served as the Miami Heat's president since 1995, was back in Los Angeles this weekend as the Lakers made him the eighth member of the franchise to receive a statue outside Crypto.com Arena. Riley won six NBA titles with the Lakers that included one as a player, one as an assistant coach and four as head coach during franchise's iconic \"Showtime\" era during the 1980s. The statue depicts Riley with his patented slicked back hair and dressed in one of his tailored Armani suits. The statue also includes the following quote Riley that has long attributed to his father, the same quote he referenced during his famous pregame speech that helped spearhead the Lakers' comeback over the Boston Celtics during the 1985 NBA Finals: \"There will come a time when you are challenged. And when that time comes, you must plant your feet. You must stand firm. You must make a point. About who you are, what you do, and where you come from. And when that time comes, you do it.\" \nSeveral prominent figures in Lakers history spoke at the statue unveiling, including \"Showtime\" stars Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Shaquille O'Neal, a fellow former Lakers great who won a title with Riley with the Heat in 2006, also spoke in a video that was played. Dwyane Wade, who led the Heat to that championship victory over the Dallas Mavericks, also spoke at the ceremony. Heat owner Micky Arison was also in attendance. O'Neal, during his speech, recalled a practice where he confronted Riley, who stood his ground. \n\"I remember thinking, 'Oh, this man is different.'\" O'Neal recalled. \"You don't build dynasties if you're afraid of personalities, and Pat was never afraid.\"O'Neal also confirmed that Riley -- a master motivator -- did indeed dunk his head in a bucket of freezing water and held his breath for more than four minutes in an effort to galvanize his team. \"Finally, he came up, gasping for air, and said, 'We cannot win unless we treat it as if it's our last breath,'\" O'Neal recalled. \"That's how he coached. Everything urgent, everything intense, everything championship level. And that mentality, that's why this statue belongs here.\" \nJohnson, who became arguably the greatest point guard in NBA history under Riley's watch, called on the other \"Showtime\" members in the audience to stand while giving his speech. \nJeanie Buss, the governor and minority owner of the Lakers, also spoke while reference what her farther, the late Dr. Jerry Buss, said of Riley during his 2010 induction into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\"Dr. Buss was right of course. Pat really was a guardian angel for this franchise, its employees, and most important, its fans across the world,\" she said. \nA tenacious, blue collar player who played for the legendary Adolph Rupp at Kentucky, Riley was a member of the 1972 Lakers team that won a then-NBA record 69 regular season games and continues to hold the NBA record with 33 consecutive games. He then dabbled in broadcasting before winning a title in 1980 as Paul Westhead's assistant. Riley was promoted to head coach during the 1982 season and quickly guided the Lakers to another NBA title. The Lakers then lost consecutive NBA Finals that included a gut-wrenching loss the Celtics in 1984 in a classic series that went the distance. In what was arguably his greatest coaching moment, Riley led the Lakers to a six-game series win over the Celtics in the 1985 NBA Finals after Los Angeles lost by 34 points in Game 1 in a game that was immediately dubbed \"The Memorial Day Massacre.\" Riley's passionate leadership appeared to have a significant impact on Abdul-Jabbar, who at age 38 was named the MVP of the series after leading the Lakers to their first championship series win over the Celtics. \nTwo years later, the Lakers defeated the Celtics in the NBA Finals on the strength of Johnson, who was named the MVP of the regular season and the Finals after Riley directed him at the start of the season to become the focal point of the offense from a scoring standpoint, something that point guards of that era seldom did. \"I said, 'Did you ask Kareem?'\" Johnson jokingly recalled saying to Riley during his speech. \"He pushed me to a whole other level. ... Pat was way ahead of his time in coaching.\" During the team's victory celebration, Riley famously guaranteed the Lakers would successfully defend their title. It wasn't easy, by the Lakers did defeat the Pistons in a classic seven-game series to become the NBA's first repeat champion in 19 years. \nRiley later enjoyed successful coaching stops with the New York Knicks and Miami Heat. In 1994, he led the Knicks to their first NBA Finals appearance in 21 years. In Miami, he coached the Heat to their first title before overseeing the franchise's last two championship wins as team president. \"Pat could build different identities in different cities,\" Wade said during his speech. \"Showtime to grit, it's the same standard, it's the same leadership. Just a little different style.\" As he concluded his speech, Riley fittingly alluded to the Lakers' arch rival, whom they would face yet again later in the day. \n\"The time has come to kick some ass,\" Riley told the crowd. \"The time has come to kick some Boston ass.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Kentucky dropped its third consecutive game Saturday in a 75-74 loss at Auburn, and it came in controversial fashion. Coach Mark Pope was audibly frustrated with the officials who whistled the Wildcats for a pivotal foul which set up a game-winning bucket for Auburn's Elyjah Freeman. After dancing around criticism of the officials during his postgame media availability, Pope could be heard on a hot mic laying into the SEC and the crew that called the contest.\"If those mother-effers try to fine me, screw 'em,\" Pope said after he left the media room. \"I did not say a word about how they cheated us.\"Pope's frustration stemmed from a critical call with 14.3 seconds to play. Leading by a point, the Wildcats inbounded from underneath their own basket when a whistle blew the play dead. Officials called Collin Chandler for an offensive foul when he shoved Auburn's Kevin Overton to the floor to gain separation. While Chandler clearly extended both arms on the shove, Pope was bewildered by the call.In Kentucky's defense, there was mutual contact between the players. Overton wrapped one of his arms around Chandler's back before the push-off for what could have been called a holding foul.\nBefore his comments on the hot mic, Pope addressed the situation with care not to place direct blame on the officials.\"We're not allowed to talk about the referees, but you guys saw it, and I think sometimes it's just super personal,\" Pope said. \"I'm not allowed to comment on the referees. I won't comment on the referees. It's unfortunate. It didn't cost us the game. We're in control of the game, so we'll find ways to go win.\"The foul turned the ball over to Auburn, which scored a game-winning basket on the ensuing possession. KeShawn Murphy missed a close-range shot, but Freeman flew in for the rebound and tipped in a putback with 1.1 seconds remaining, pushing the Tigers on top by a point.\n\"We refuse to give control to people that are outside of our program,\" Pope said. \"Refuse. Regardless of how personal it might get or how bad it might get. We refuse to give control to fans, to give control to anybody else associated with this game, regardless of how blatantly people are trying to make this not happen.\"We're not giving away our power. We're not. We don't make excuses. We don't do that regardless of what is happening, regardless of how disgraceful things are. We don't give away our power regardless of how embarrassing, personal, awful, unacceptable things are. We refuse to give away our power.\"Every loss for Kentucky adds to the disappointment of what initially projected to be a national championship-contending season. The Wildcats slipped to 17-10 with the defeat and are a projected No. 6 seed in the NCAA Tournament, per CBS Sports bracketology.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        In 2010, Sidney Crosby propelled the Canada men's hockey team to a gold medal after scoring the game-winning goal in overtime against Team USA. On Sunday, though, Crosby looked on from the sideline as Jack Hughes' overtime goal lifted the Americans to a 2-1 win over Canada as Team USA won the gold for the first time since 1980. Crosby missed Canada's final two games of the Olympics after he sustained a lower-body injury during the quarterfinals. He said that the decision to sit out Canada's eventual loss to Team USA was his and his alone. \"I was pretty close,\" he said. \"I mean, ultimately I wasn't able to go out there and do what I needed to do in order to help the team, so at that point, you've got to make a decision that's best for the group. Not an easy one. But, you know, that's hockey.\"Crosby, a three-time Stanley Cup champion with the Pittsburgh Penguins who also helped the Canadians win the gold medal in 2014, said that this Canada team deserved a better outcome than what ultimately unfolded on Sunday. \"I think everyone should be proud the way the team performed,\" he said. \"I thought that, obviously, we did everything but score. In every facet, we were just so good today. I thought we deserved better, and unfortunately, you know, didn't come away at the win.\" Canada's Nathan McKinnon was a little more blunt during his postgame presser. \n\"You be the judge of who was the better team today,\" said McKinnon, who missed a golden chance to give Canada a 2-1 lead in the third period.Crosby's absence was certainly felt, especially on the offensive end. Canada got just one of its 42 shots past Connor Hellebuyck and were unable to take advantage of an extended 5-on-3 power play in the second period. The Canadians lost despite out-shooting the Americans, 42-26.\n        \n            \n                Team USA honors Johnny Gaudreau after defeating Canada to win the gold medal\n                \n                    Bryan DeArdo                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTeam USA got on the board first on Matt Boldy's first-period goal. Cale Makar tied things up in the second, and the game went into overtime after neither team was able to score during the third period. The Americas captured gold during the 3-on-3 overtime when Zach Werenski fed Jack Hughes for the game-winning goal.Crosby said that he was \"really proud\" of his team despite Sunday's outcome. \n\"I thought that the way we played all tournament, even the games leading up, I thought we were really good,\" he said. \"We were tested in some of those games. It's not easy to get to this point, and we just found ways. I thought one of our best games was probably today. And unfortunately, it doesn't work out for us. But I'm just really proud of the group and the way we competed and the way we played.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Officials handed out a pair of ejections after Memphis Grizzlies guard Scotty Pippen Jr. and Miami Heat forward Myron Gardner engaged in an altercation during the Heat's 136-120 win on Saturday. Pippen and Gardner watched the final 1:55 from the locker rooms as a result of their scuffle, which spilled into the courtside seats on one corner of the floor.An unnecessary hit on one end of the floor led to the skirmish on the other. Pippen drained a 3-pointer from the top of the arc to cut the Grizzlies' deficit to 134-113 with two minutes to play, and well after he released the ball, Gardner stepped in from well out of the play and made contact with Pippen's backside, sending him to the floor. There was no foul call.Pippen ran down the floor and clearly sought out Gardner in the left corner. He extended both arms in a targeted shove of Gardner, and the two tangled up and pulled each other to the ground. Officials, players and coaches sprinted to the scene to attempt to break up the fight. No other players engaged in fighting.\n\"I thought it was kind of a cheap shot,\" Pippen said of the play that sparked the fight. \"He kind of hit me when I didn't see him, so I thought it was a soft move. I just thought he maybe needed a hug at the other end, and that's kind of what happened.\"Pippen and Gardner could face discipline from the NBA, although the former downplayed the kerfuffle and said he does not expect the league to step in with punishment beyond the ejections.\n\"I don't think any punches or anything was thrown,\" Pippen said. \"I think it was just a hug. I don't think it was too crazy. I got ejected. I think that should be left at that, but we'll see.\"Heat coach Erik Spoelstra came to Gardner's defense after his involvement in the brouhaha and said that he loves Myron \"regardless\" of what occurred between him and Pippen.\"Let's exhale,\" Spoelstra said postgame. \"We'll take a look at it. His greatest strength is his unbridled intensity and effort and energy. His heart is in a great place. He's wired like us, competitively. You add that type of intensity to this competitive will that will boil over at times. I don't want to take away from that competitiveness.\"\nPippen finished the contest with 18 points in 21 minutes off the bench for a Memphis team that is spiraling further toward the bottom of the Western Conference with five losses in its last six games and 11 in its last 14. Gardner played six minutes across two stints on the floor for the Southeast Division-leading Heat.\n            ",

He previously performed at the Winter Olympics 20 years ago to kick off the Turin Games.In between the many performances, was the parade of athletes, the passing of the Olympic torch and the awarding of the final two Olympic gold medals of the Winter Games.Here are the highlights and best moments from the 2026 Winter Olympics Closing Ceremony.\nHilary Knight & Evan Bates walk in as flag bearersFresh off a winning a gold medal for the U.S. women's hockey team, Knight was one of two flag bearers for the Americans. During the gold-medal match, Knight broke the American women's record for career goals previously held by Natalie Darwitz and Katie King. In doing so, she also broke the record for most career Olympic points in U.S. women's hockey history. It was a thrilling comeback win for the women's hockey team, which rallied from a 1-0 deficit against Canada to win 2-1 in overtime. Knight's game-tying goal in the third period kept the Americans alive to eventually win in overtime.Bates won a gold medal in the figure skating team event with the United States, as well as a silver medal in the ice dance competition with partner, and wife, Madison Chock. The duo became just the third American duo to win a silver medal in ice dance, the first since the 2010 Winter Games.\nAlysa Liu hints at future plans for skatingIce skating sensation Alysa Liu was on hand for the closing ceremony, just as joyful as she was the day she won gold in the women's singles event for the United States. Liu became the first American woman to take home gold in the singles event since 2002, jumping from third to first after a near flawless free skate program that went viral on social media.\nLiu became a national treasure as her unique journey to becoming an Olympic gold medalist spoke to so many people. Liu had been competitively skating since the age of 10, and after winning multiple national awards, she announced her retirement at 16 years old. Two years later, though, Liu returned to the sport, vowing to do it her way by picking her own schedule and adhering to a less stringent regimen that is often associated with the sport. She returned in 2024, and the following year she became a world champion. Now, she's an Olympic gold medalist and stands on top of the ice skating world.At the Closing Ceremony, Liu was asked about her plans in skating for the future, to which she was enthused about continuing in the sport.\"I have no plans to leave yet,\" Lu said when asked if she'll perform at the 2030 Winter Games. \"I can't imagine not skating next year.\"\nCross-country skiers awarded gold medalsAs per tradition, the last two gold medals were awarded at the Closing Ceremony. That distinction goes to the winners of the 50 km classic mass start cross country skiers. The honor is meant to highlight the grueling endurance that it takes to compete in the sport. Marathon runners are given the same distinction at the Summer Games.Sweden's Ebba Andersson was awarded her gold medal after beating out Norway's Heidi Weng by 2 minutes and 15 seconds in the event.On the men's side, Norway's Johannes Hoesflot Klaebo was awarded his sixth gold medal of the Milan Corina Games. With the 50 km classic mass start win, Klaebo set the record for the only winter sport athlete to win six gold medals in a single Winter Olympics. It brings Klaebo's gold medal total to 11, which means swimmer Michael Phlelps as the only other Olympian to hold more gold medals than him.\n\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Oldest Olympic volunteer honored at Closing CeremonySet to the catchy 1998 song by Italian music group Eiffel 65, Blue (Da Ba Dee), a performance was put on to honor the over 18,000 volunteers at the Winter Games. Amongst those volunteers is 88-year-old Mario Gargiulo, who was a volunteer the last time Milan Cortina hosted the Olympics back in 1956.\nTeaser for 2028 Summer Games in Los AngelesWhile the Closing Ceremony focused heavily on Italian culture, and the passing of the Olympic flag to France to host the 2030 Winter Games, we also got a nice table setter for the next Summer Olympics in 2028. Held in Los Angeles, the Closing Ceremony broadcast ended with Academy Award-nominated actress and singer Kate Hudson singing a cover of \"California Dreamin'\" by The Mamas and the Papas.As Hudson sang, a montage of various American athletes were featured in the promo video. It was the perfect video to get everyone hyped for the next Summer Games, which will surely be a spectacle in La La Land.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Arsenal restored their five-point lead atop the Premier League table with a 4-1 win at Tottenham Hotspur in the North London Derby on Sunday, taking full advantage of their injury-riddled opponents in a must-win match.Though Spurs returned to play for the first time since hiring Igor Tudor to replace Thomas Frank, the match went as expected for two sides in full contrast. Arsenal dictated play and were rewarded with a 32nd-minute goal from Eberechi Eze, who scored from close range as a frantic Spurs defense failed to cope with the Gunners' attacking charge. The visitors' lead was gone in a matter of two minutes courtesy of Randal Kolo Muani, who won possession on the left side of the penalty area and then cut inside for a strike right in front of goal.The stat sheet at halftime was reflective of the realities that the visitors were in the midst of a title charge and the hosts are technically staving off relegation and entered the weekend with 13 fit senior team players, as well as Spurs' stylistic tendencies. With only two true attack-minded players on the pitch and boasting a roster that, even at full fitness, is not built to be an offensive might, they had just two shots and 0.29 expected goals at the halftime break. Arsenal, meanwhile, took full advantage of an understaffed Spurs defense that was missing the suspended Cristian Romero and the injured Kevin Danso and had 12 shots and one expected goal.Things finally tipped in the Gunners' favor in the second half, first with Viktor Gyokere's impressive strike from distance in the 47th minute and then Eze's second strike in the 61st minute, the England international capitalizing on a sloppy moment from Spurs' defense along the way. In between Arsenal's second-half goals, Spurs thought they had an equalizer through Kolo Muani but he was called for a push on Gabriel in the process of scoring.\nSpurs attempted a attacking surge towards the end of the match, substitute Richarlison managing two shots in the dying minutes of the match, but their efforts did not pay off and in one of the final moments of the match, Gyokeres completed a brace of his own to ensure the Gunners would take all three points home.Eze, who joined Arsenal this summer from Crystal Palace and nearly signed with Tottenham, scored a hat trick against Spurs earlier this season.\nThis is Arsenal's first Premier League win in three, their grip on first place slipping slightly over the process. They finish the weekend five points ahead of Manchester City, who kept pace with a 2-1 win over Newcastle United on Saturday and also have a game in hand.\n            ",

For the first time in Olympic history, Team USA completed a sweep of hockey gold medals in the men's and women's events at the 2026 Milan Cortina Olympics as the men won an overtime match 2-1 over Canada on Sunday to claim the Americans' first gold medal in 46 years.The women won in nearly identical fashion with a 2-1 overtime victory against Canada on Friday to bring home their first gold medal in eight years.The United States is only the second country in history to sweep gold medals in men's and women's hockey during the same Olympic Games, joining Canada, which did so three times in 2002, 2010 and 2014.American men had not won gold since the famed \"Miracle on Ice\" team, which defeated the Soviet Union in 1980. Sunday's win came exactly 46 years to the day of that victory (Feb. 22, 1980).\nThe U.S. now has three Olympic gold medals on the men's side, having first won the hardware in 1960. Sunday's victory was its first off home ice in the Olympics. The women also have three gold medals, previously claiming the honors in 1998 and 2018.Four of the United States' six Olympic gold medals in hockey have come by defeating Canada.\nTeam USA gold medals in Olympic hockeyOlympicsTeamOpponentScore1960 Squaw ValleyMenCzechoslovakia9-41980 Lake PlacidMenSoviet Union4-31998 NaganoWomenCanada3-12018 PyeongChangWomenCanada3-22026 Milan CortinaWomenCanada2-1 (OT)2026 Milan CortinaMenCanada2-1 (OT)The Americans concluded the 2026 Olympics with 12 gold medals, the most ever for the Americans at the Winter Games, and 33 medals overall.

The most significant change (of many!) will be a new No. 1 team for the second time in as many weeks after No. 3 Duke downed No. 1 Michigan in the nation's capital, 68-63, on Saturday night.Duke will likely supplant the Wolverines at No. 1 after a brief, one-week stint at the top, bringing forward a fifth team on the season to hold the No. 1 spot. Houston also held the No. 1 spot one week (in Week 2), while Purdue and Arizona also had stretches as the top-ranked team.Duke's rise will obviously come at the expense of its Saturday victim, Michigan, which -- along with Houston -- is expected to drop in the rankings. But with eight of the top 10 teams stumbling this week, voters have their work cut out making heads or tails of how to slot teams in their ballots.\nHere's our best guess at how the rankings will look and how voters' ballots will shake out.1\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    Duke was named the No. 2 overall team by the selection committee on Saturday, the second No. 1 seed behind only Michigan, so its head-to-head win over the Wolverines later in the day should catapult it into the top spot Monday and in the driver's seat to be the No. 1 overall seed.2\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    Arizona won 73-66 over Houston on the road Saturday to claim its second consecutive ranked win in as many tries. The Wildcats are 25-2 and look like they haven't missed a beat without the services of star freshman Koa Peat. They're that good.3\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    A fall is likely for last week's No. 1, Michigan, even if a large fall is unlikely.

    "body": "\nThe Boston Celtics were red-hot as they entered the All-Star break, winning six of their last seven games. They picked up where they left off after the hiatus as they began a four-game road trip with a 121-110 triumph over the Golden State Warriors.Boston (36-19) attempts to continue its surge when it takes on the Los Angeles Lakers (34-21) at 6:30 p.m. ET on Sunday at Crypto.com Arena.The Celtics have gone 12-4 since suffering back-to-back losses against the San Antonio Spurs and Indiana Pacers in mid-January. They now look to complete a sweep of the two-game season series after having trounced the Lakers 126-105 at home on Dec. 5.Los Angeles also has been playing well of late, winning 10 of its last 15 contests. The Lakers edged the Los Angeles Clippers 125-122 on Friday in their return from the All-Star break.There are 10 other games on Sunday's NBA schedule, including a matchup between the Orlando Magic (29-26) and host Clippers (27-29) at 9 p.m. ET at the Intuit Dome. The Magic cruised past the Clippers 129-101 at home in November to end their four-game losing streak in the all-time series.Meanwhile, the Warriors (29-27) hope to get on track when they host the Denver Nuggets (36-21) at 3:30 p.m. ET at the Chase Center in San Francisco. Golden State has lost back-to-back contests and eight of 12 since enjoying a four-game winning streak in mid-January.More than 20 games are on Sunday's college basketball slate, one of which is a Big Ten Conference clash that has Iowa (19-7) facing No. 24 Wisconsin (18-8) at 4 p.m. ET at the Kohl Center in Madison. The Hawkeyes are seeking their second straight victory against a ranked opponent after getting past No. 9 Nebraska 57-52 last Tuesday.The Nuggets are 6.5-point favorites against the Warriors in the latest consensus NBA odds, while the Celtics are 1.5-point favorites against the Lakers. The Clippers are 2.5-point favorites over the Magic and Wisconsin is a 3.5-point favorite against Iowa.Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Sunday, Feb. 22. All times EasternNBA best bets, where to watchNuggets at WarriorsTime: 3:30 p.m. | Location: San Francisco | TV: ABC | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Warriors +6.5 (-113) | Expert: Gui Santos Over 11.5 points (-123, PropBetGuy)The Nuggets were edged by the Clippers 115-114 in their return from the All-Star break but rebounded the following night, demolishing the Portland Trail Blazers by 54 points. Denver set a franchise record for most points in a road game with 157 in that victory. The Warriors have suffered back-to-back losses, but the SportsLine Projection Model doesn't believe they'll get trounced like Portland did as they cover the spread in 62% of its simulations. Golden State's Gui Santos is averaging only six points per game this season but has recorded at least 13 in seven of his last eight outings, and SportsLine props expert PropBetGuy (98-71, +1537 on his last 169 NBA player prop picks) likes the trend to continue. The 23-year-old forward faces a Denver defense that forces the action to secondary scorers and allows spot-up shots as the third-highest frequency in the league.Celtics at LakersTime: 6:30 p.m. | Location: Los Angeles | TV: NBC | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Celtics -131 | Expert: Payton Pritchard Over 5.5 assists (-139, Larry Hartstein)The Celtics are 18-10 on the road this season and have won three straight away from home. The Lakers were without both LeBron James and Luka Doncic in their 21-point loss at Boston earlier this season, but the SportsLine Projection Model doesn't think their presence on Sunday will be enough as its simulations have the Celtics winning 70% of the time. Payton Pritchard, who is averaging 5.4 assists this campaign, registered six in the first meeting with the Lakers also had a half-dozen against the Warriors on Thursday. SportsLine expert Larry Hartstein thinks the 28-year-old guard will reach that total against a Lakers squad that is allowing the eighth-most assists (27.5) per contest this season.Magic at ClippersTime: 9 p.m. | Location: Inglewood, Cal. | TV: NBA TV | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine pick -- Model: Clippers -135The Clippers will be looking to avenge their 28-point loss in Orlando and post their fifth victory in six meetings with the Magic. They'll definitely be more rested for this matchup as they last played on Friday while Orlando is coming off a 113-110 double-overtime loss to the Suns in Phoenix on Saturday night. The SportsLine Projection Model has the Clippers winning in 72% of its simulations.CBB best bets, where to watchIowa at No. 24 WisconsinTime: 4 p.m. | Location: Madison, Wisc. | TV: FS1 | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Over 147.5 (-109) | Expert: Wisconsin -2.5 (-110, Bruce Marshall)The Hawkeyes are the top defensive team in the Big Ten and ninth in the nation as they are allowing an average of 64.4 points. However, they yielded 70 or more points in four consecutive games before holding Nebraska to 52 last time out. The Badgers are third on the conference in scoring at 83.1 points per contest despite their 69-point effort in last Tuesday's loss to Ohio State and are 15th defensively in the 18-team Big Ten with an average of 76.0 points allowed. With all of that taken into account, the SportsLine Projection Model sees this matchup being an offensive battle as its simulations have the Over hitting well over 76% of the time. Wisconsin posted double-digit victories in each of its last two home games, and SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall feels the Badgers will at least cover the spread against Iowa.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        It's important to draw a distinction between resume metrics and predictive metrics when talking about a team like Miami (Ohio) and the NCAA Tournament bubble. Selection decisions are closely tied to your resume and what you've accomplished, which is a good thing for Miami. The cries are already coming: \"But Miami hasn't even played a Quad 1 game!\"Despite the fact that it has played zero Quad 1 games and is just 1-0 in Quad 2, there is a metric on official NCAA team sheets that acknowledges the brilliance of an unbeaten start for Miami, which improved to 27-0 with a 91-77 win over Bowling Green on Feb. 20.It's called Wins Against Bubble (WAB), and it calculates how the average bubble team would perform against your schedule. With a WAB score of 2.18 as of Feb. 22, the No. 22 RedHawks are recognized for having over two more victories than the average bubble team would against their slate.Up next for MiamiThe remaining schedule for Miami which is trying to become the first team since Indiana accomplished the feat in the 1975-76 season.\nFeb. 24at Eastern Michigan6:30 pm ESPN+Feb. 27at Western Michigan6 p.m. CBS Sports NetworkMarch 3vs. Toledo7 p.m. ESPN+March 6at Ohio7 p.m. CBS Sports NetworkMarch 12-14MAC Tournament (Cleveland)TBDIf Miami doesn't win the MAC Tournament and needs an at-large ticket to the Big Dance, WAB will be one of its best friends. The RedHawks were ranked No. 34 in WAB as of Feb. 22. That's within at-large territory. Where it gets tricky is that any loss against MAC opposition carries a significant WAB penalty.Here are all the Selection Sunday scenarios for Miami as it heads down this the stretch with its first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2007 in sight.NCAA Tournament selection scenarios for Miami The simple scenario (win MAC Tournament) Record: Between 30-4 and 34-0 Confidence level: It's a partyLikely WAB range: Doesn't matter\nBust out the balloons and hire a caterer for the watch party. Miami can go 4-0 to close the regular season, 0-4 or something in between. It doesn't matter, so long as the RedHawks are cutting down the nets inside Cleveland's Rocket Arena at the end of the MAC Tournament on March 14. Winning the MAC Tournament is the only 100% guaranteed path to the Big Dance, and it won't be easy. The MAC isn't one of the handful of conferences now offering automatic byes to the semifinals for its top two seeds. The RedHawks will have to win three games in three days against a field consisting exclusively of the league's top eight teams.Many of the players on this Miami team were part of a gutting 76-74 loss to Akron in last year's MAC Tournament title game in which the Zips rallied late to stun the RedHawks. That should only provide more motivation as Miami seeks its first conference tournament title since 2007.\nThe MAC Madness scenarioSelection Sunday record: 31-1, 32-1 or 33-1Confidence level: Feeling optimisticLikely WAB range: 37-43Miami could still feel reasonably hopeful about making the Big Dance if it entered the MAC Tournament 31-0 and then dropped a game. While on some level it could matter who the loss came against, the RedHawks would still enter Selection Sunday with a WAB ranking in the at-large realm, regardless of who was responsible for handing them their first defeat.A loss on a neutral floor in the MAC Tournament would likely come with a WAB cost of around 0.80. If Miami lost 0.80 in WAB today, it would drop the RedHawks  from No. 34 in the metric to the low 40s.\nThe team with the best WAB ranking left out of last year's field was West Virginia, which arrived at Selection Sunday at No. 43 in the WAB. The 2025 selection process was the first to utilize WAB, so there isn't a trove of past precedents to rely upon. But WVU's exclusion last year sets a benchmark for Miami to aim for: don't fall to No. 43.Finishing the regular season undefeated and then losing in the MAC Tournament would likely be good enough to keep the RedHawks around or just below that figure, which would be enough for them to enter Selection Sunday with some cautious optimism.Double-defeat scenarioSelection Sunday record: 30-2, 31-2 or 32-2Confidence level: Feeling nervousLikely WAB range: 43-52\nThe double-defeat scenario involves Miami losing one regular-season game, in addition to a MAC Tournament game. This would not be advisable, as it would likely lead to Miami's Selection Sunday WAB ranking landing in the mid-40s, at best. However, in this scenario, the opponent for the conference tournament loss could make a difference. If it's a high-end Quad 2 loss against Akron in the title game, then it would be less costly.The team with the worst WAB ranking selected to last year's field was Xavier, which was among the Last Four In at No. 49 in WAB. However, the Musketeers counterbalanced their lagging resume metrics with a predictive metrics profile hovering around 40th nationally. \nMiami University does not have good predictive metrics to fall back upon. So slipping out of the low-to-mid 40s in WAB would make things dicey. If Miami loses twice, a slip of that magnitude is likely, and it would make Selection Sunday uncomfortable.Three-loss scenarioSelection Sunday record: 29-3, 30-3, 31-3Confidence level: Better brace for disappointmentLikely WAB range: 50-60A 2-2 finish to the regular season, combined with a loss in the MAC Tournament, would decimate Miami's at-large chances. In this scenario, the best conceivable outcome would be that the RedHawks  lose in the MAC Tournament title game against Akron in a heartbreaking way that tugs on the heartstrings of committee members. But it would be a tough case to make. \nWith three losses on its ledger, Miami would almost certainly lag behind other bubble teams in resume metrics. Remember, it's not just about win-loss record. It's about the totality of your resume. WAB does a good job of quantifying that, and it wouldn't be on Miami's side if the RedHawks  lost three times.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Arguably the biggest stop en route to the NFL Draft is the NFL Scouting Combine, which brings well over 300 of the most talented football players in America to Indianapolis. There, the prospects will go through drills that test everything from their athleticism to their ability to fulfill the duties of their specific position on the football field. Every year, players utilize the combine, where all 32 NFL teams are represented by scouts and front office personnel, to improve their stock after putting together film in their final collegiate season. The NFL sent invites to 319 players in February now that the 2025 season is in the rearview mirror. It should come as no surprise that some of college football's top brands, like Alabama and Ohio State, will be sending plenty of players to Indianapolis. But upstarts like nearby Indiana, which completed one of the best Cinderella stories in college football history with a national title last season, have plenty of talent headed to the combine. \n        \n            \n                Wilson's 2026 NFL mock draft 6.0: Senior Bowl standouts Caleb Banks, Lee Hunter change Round 1 conversation\n                \n                    Ryan Wilson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHere's a look at the college programs that produced the most invites to the 2026 NFL Scouting Combine: \n1. Texas A&M -- 13 Notable players: WR KC Concepcion; OL Ar'maj Reed-Adams; DL Cashius Howell; LB Taurean York; DB Will Lee III Texas A&M, fresh off of its College Football Playoff debut, will have plenty of representation at the combine. Many eyes will be on the dynamic Concepcion, who has a chance to put up some eye-popping numbers. But the Aggies will have plenty of trench monsters going through drills as well. Four of their five offensive line starters and three of their top defensive linemen from the 2025 season are headed to Indianapolis. 2. Alabama -- 12 Notable players: QB Ty Simpson; WR Germie Bernard; OL Kadyn Proctor; DL LT Overton; LB Deontae Lawson \nThe combine should be a great opportunity for Simpson to boost his draft stock even further in a relatively weak quarterback class. He's already viewed as a first-round pick and his accuracy should show through in the routes-on-air period. Bernard is another potential riser to keep an eye on. He flew under the radar for most of the season, though he was Simpson's favorite target in the passing attack. Bernard's best work may come with the pads on, as he's a tough-running magician after the catch, but solid testing numbers could push him into an upper echelon. T-3. Ohio State -- 11 Notable players: WR Carnell Tate; TE Max Klare; DL Caden Curry; DL Kayden McDonald; LB Arvell Reese; DB Caleb Downs It should come as no surprise, given how dominant Ohio State was in 2025, that its defense leads the way among combine invites. Seven of the 11 prospects that will represent the Buckeyes in Indianapolis played on the defensive side of the ball. That includes several likely first-round prospects. Reese has a chance to be the first defender taken off the board. He can play off the ball or at edge rusher at the next level. McDonald was a unanimous All-American and the Big Ten Defensive Lineman of the Year. Downs has been one of the top defensive backs in college football since he stepped foot on campus, and he's only solidified that status over the last couple of seasons with the Buckeyes. He'll be a rare early safety picked in the 2026 NFL Draft. \nT-3. LSU -- 11 Notable players: QB Garrett Nussmeier; WR Barion Brown; LB Harold Perkins Jr.; DB Mansoor Delane; DB. A.J. Haulcy LSU may have had a disappointing season, but it certainly wasn't due to a lack of talent. Nussmeier did underperform while battling through various injury issues. Maybe he can use the combine to remind scouts why he was once thought of as a top prospect. Brown will certainly turn some heads. He's a top candidate to post the fastest 40-yard dash time of the entire event. T-5. Georgia -- 10 Notable players: WR Zachariah Branch; WR Colbie Young; DL Christen Miller; LB CJ Allen \nSpeaking of impressive 40-yard dash times, Branch will be a must-watch for those that enjoy speed. He's a fun gadget player that could find a nice home at the next level as a return specialist. Young is a physically impressive wideout. If his 6-foot-3 and 215-pound frame is verified by combine measurements, that will certainly stand out. T-5. Oklahoma -- 10Notable players: TE Jaren Kanak; DL Gracen Halton; DL R Mason Thomas; LB Owen Heinecke; DB Robert Spears-JenningsKanak is a fascinating prospect. He spent the first three years of his career as a linebacker before transitioning to tight end ahead of the 2025 season. He was a third-team All-SEC selection after finishing third among Sooners with 44 catches for 533 yards. It will be fascinating to see how he tests and where he lands in the draft. Oklahoma has seven defenders headed to the combine after its defense led the way to a College Football Playoff appearance last season. Four defensive linemen will rep the Sooners, who were gritty in the trenches in 2025. \nT-5. Miami -- 10 Notable players: QB Carson Beck; OL Francis Mauigoa; DL Rueben Bain Jr.; DL Akheem Mesidor; DB Keionte Scott Miami has a lot of extremely talented big fellas headed to the next level. Stalwarts like Mauigoa, a dominant offensive tackle, and Bain were a big reason why the Hurricanes made it all the way to the College Football Playoff National Championship. The edge-rushing duo of Bain and Mesidor played some of their best football in the postseason. They combined for a whopping 10.5 sacks during Miami's four-game run through the playoff. T-8. Clemson -- 9Notable players: QB Cade Klubnik; RB Adam Randall; WR Antonio Williams; DL T.J. Parker; DL Peter Woods \nKlubnik had a very disappointing 2025 campaign, but perhaps he can revive his image at the combine. As it has been so often with Clemson, though, defense is the focus here. Parker and Woods are two of the best defensive prospects in the draft. Both should hear their names called very early. T-8. Florida -- 9 Notable players: OL Jake Slaughter; DL Caleb Banks No matter how much Florida struggles on the field, it will always be well-represented in the draft. The Gators are good at churning out talent thanks to their ideal recruiting situation. Slaughter is arguably the top center prospect in the draft and Banks is a highly regarded defensive lineman that should have a solid professional career. T-8. Indiana -- 9 Notable players: QB Fernando Mendoza; WR Elijah Sarratt; OL Pat Coogan; LB Aiden Fisher; DB D'Angelo Ponds \nThe reigning national champions, obviously, have plenty of stars worth mentioning. Mendoza won the Heisman Trophy and, in all likelihood, he'll follow that up by going first overall in the 2026 NFL Draft. Ponds has a great shot to hear his name called in the first round as well, though his size may hold him back. Fisher has all the makings of a mid-round steal. He's a fundamentally sound linebacker that's always around the ball. It will be interesting to see how his athletic profile stacks up, but the tape doesn't lie. T-8. Iowa -- 9 Notable players: WR Kaden Wetjen; OL Gennings Dunker; OL Logan Jones; DB Xavier Nwankpa Don't sleep on the Hawkeyes. Wetjen is a fun player to watch. He's got a chance to carve out a solid career as a return specialist. Dunker and Jones are two of three starting offensive linemen from Iowa's 2025 squad that are expected to be drafted. \nT-8. Penn State -- 9 Notable players: QB Drew Allar; RB Kaytron Allen; RB Nicholas Singleton; OL Olaivavega Ioane; DL Dani Dennis-Sutton Allar probably won't compete at the combine as he continues to recover from an ankle injury that cut his 2025 season short. An NFL team will likely still take a late-round flier on him given his frame and natural talent. Allen and Singleton are both intriguing talents in their own right. Allen was the better of the two last season, but both had great moments in their collegiate careers and both should hear their names called in April. \n            ",

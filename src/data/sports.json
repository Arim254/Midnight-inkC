    "body": "\n        The National Women's Soccer League has its first-ever back-to-back MVP winner. Kansas City Current forward Temwa Chawinga was awarded 2025 NWSL MVP on Wednesday through a tiered voting process that included players, coaches and executives, media, and fans. She is only the second player to win two NWSL MVP awards.The Malawi international was up against four other candidates, including club teammate Bia Zaneratto. Only Sam Kerr has won two MVP awards, in separate years, along with Golden Boot and best XI honors. Chawinga led the league in scoring with 15 goals in 23 regular-season appearances, and six of her goals were game-winners, matching a record she set last season. Chawinga walked away on the night with three individual awards: MVP, 2025 Golden Boot, and a spot on the NWSL's Best XI. She received them during NWSL Championship week in a special event at the San Jose Civic Center. It's the first-ever NWSL formal awards show and ceremony in its 13-year history. The MVP winner told the media after the ceremony that her favorite goal scored this year was her header goal, which was her first header scored in NWSL, and that winning this year feels different with the added special event.\"We didn't have an event like this. Just sent an email. And last season was like, I didn't know anything. I just came here like \"Okay, we'll see what type of players [and they're] great players. So, I'm so grateful that [media] chose me.

Oladotun chose Maryland over Georgetown, Kentucky and Arkansas.\"The relationship I built with coach Buzz Williams and the entire coaching staff was really crucial to me,\" he said during his announcement aired live on his YouTube channel. \"They took the time to get to know me and my entire family.\"Oladotun's said his two older sisters go to Maryland so the chance to be close to family -- and close to home as a Maryland native -- was for him a place that offered \"so many opportunities.\" He added his trainers and his entire support system are also there.\nOladotun was originally in the 2027 class and ranked as the No. 1 player before reclassifying in August. 247Sports ranks him as the No. 3 small forward in the class. 247Sports' Director of Scouting, Adam Finkelstein, said this of him this summer after the reclassification. He has been highly productive on the Nike EYBL circuit playing for Team Durant.\nOladotun is a late-blooming jumbo wing, who has continued to grow throughout his high school years and now stands at 6-foot-10 with a 7-foot-1 wingspan. He's still physically undeveloped with a lean frame, boxy shoulders, and high center of gravity, but isn't apprehensive to play through contact and only going to keep getting better as he grows into his body.His game, like his frame, is still a work-in-progress, but loaded with long-term potential. It's the vast scope of his versatile tools that is perhaps most compelling. He's already a threat to make plays as a handler, shoot over top of contesting defenders, or take smaller defenders into the mid-post. He tends to be a bit upright, but he has good hands and is very comfortable with his dribble. He made just 28% of his threes and 63% of his free-throws in EYBL play, and has an elbow that can fly out on his way up into his release, but still soft natural shooting touch to develop.Where he really excels is with his footwork. It comes out in the mid-post area, but even more so at the end of his drives. He has an instinctive ability to navigate the lane in ways that can't be taught, with a full repertoire of maneuvers after he picks up his dribble. He decelerates well, utilizes euros, but also knows when to elongate his strides. He'll even mix in pro-hops, spins, fake-spins, and step-throughs. He's a solid athlete, who can jump off either one foot or two, and can cover ground as more of a long-jumper, but it's really the footwork between his last dribble and before his finish that is so elite.The addition of Oladotun gives Maryland the No. 3-ranked class in the 247Sports Team Rankings behind only Michigan State and Kansas. He joins a class that also includes four-star recruits Kaden House and Adama Tambedou as well as three-star wing Austin Brown.\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        A 14-game slate is featured in NFL Week 12, including a number of matchups with playoff implications. Among the biggest is when the AFC South-leading Indianapolis Colts led by quarterback Daniel Jones face the nine-time defending AFC West champion Kansas City Chiefs and quarterback Patrick Mahomes, The Chiefs have struggled to a 5-5 mark this season, which makes this as close to a must-win situation as can be this far into the season for Kansas City.

The Chiefs are -3.5, while the Packers are favored by 6.5, making them two of the nine home favorites on Sunday and Monday.A non-divisional matchup with heavy NFC playoff race implications will be played on Sunday Night Football when the Tampa Bay Buccaneers meet the Los Angeles Rams.

    "body": "\n        The World Series ended 18 days ago and we're finally getting into the full swing of the offseason. Within the last few days we've seen the winter's first significant free-agent signing (Josh Naylor back to the Mariners) and trade (Grayson Rodriguez for Taylor Ward), and there's plenty more on the way. Here now are Wednesday's hot stove rumors. Braves reunite with IglesiasThe Braves have re-signed reliever Raisel Iglesias to a one-year pact worth $16 million. \nIglesias, 35, will return for a fifth season with Atlanta. Last year, he compiled a 3.21 ERA (130 ERA+) and a 4.56 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 67 innings. His contributions were worth an estimated 1.3 Wins Above Replacement, though he did also record 11 meltdowns, per FanGraphs' calculations.Iglesias figures to slot back into a late-inning role for a Braves bullpen that also includes a returning Joe Jiménez and Aaron Bummer, among others. \n \tYankees the favorite for Bellinger? \nIt is no secret the Yankees want to retain Cody Bellinger, and they are currently seen as the clear favorites to land him, according to MLB.com. At least week's GM Meetings, GM Brian Cashman said the Yankees would continue to pursue Bellinger even if Trent Grisham accepted the $22.025 million qualifying offer, which he did at Tuesday's deadline. \"We're comfortable. This is a very thin outfield market. If he turns it down, that means the market is flush with teams that have the need,\" Cashman said about Grisham and the qualifying offer at the GM Meetings (via SNY). \"He had a hell of a year for us, was one of the big reasons we had the level of success we did, and we'd be happy if he accepted and came back.\" The Yankees have a full outfield with Grisham flanked by American League MVP Aaron Judge and erstwhile top prospect Jasson Domínguez, though they rotated Bellinger, Domínguez, and Grisham most of 2025, plus DH will be available at times. Re-signing Bellinger could also make Domínguez a trade candidate. We ranked Bellinger as the sixth-best free agent available this offseason.  \nPeralta trade not a given for Brewers\nThe NL Central champion Brewers do not see Brandon Woodruff accepting the qualifying offer as a prelude to a Freddy Peralta trade, owner Mark Attanasio told The Athletic. \"Independent decisions (president of baseball operations Matt Arnold) and his group will make. We're certainly excited about our rotation now,\" Attanasio said.Woodruff's $22.025 million salary in 2026 will be the highest for a pitcher in team history. Peralta, 29, is a year away from free agency and that is usually when Milwaukee trades its best players (Corbin Burnes, Devin Williams, etc.), though not always. The Brewers kept Willy Adames through the end of his team control years and then took the draft pick when he left as a free agent. We ranked Peralta as one of the offseason's top trade candidates. \n            ",

Each has won three of its last four, with Buffalo (7-3) sitting second in the AFC East, while Houston (5-5) is third in the AFC South. The Bills knocked off Tampa, 44-32, in Week 11, as Josh Allen accounted for six total touchdowns. Meanwhile, Houston recorded a 16-13 Sunday victory over Tennessee giving the Texans their second straight win with Davis Mills filling in for C.J. Stroud (concussion). Stroud has been ruled out for this game as well. The Bills will be without tight end Dalton Kincaid (hamstring).Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from NRG Stadium in Houston. The Texans have won five straight home games versus Buffalo, including a 23-20 triumph last season. The latest Texans vs. Bills odds have Buffalo as a 6-point favorite.

He had three passing touchdowns and three rushing touchdowns for the second such game with those stats in his career, and no other player in NFL history even has one such regular season game. With his dual-threat ability, plus James Cook, Buffalo leads the league in rushing offense. On the other side of the ball, Buffalo is elite at defending through the air, ranking in the top five in both passing yards allowed and passing touchdowns given up. Struggling to move the ball through the air would cause tons of problems for Houston, as the Texans have a bottom-10 rush offense and rank 31st in red-zone scoring. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why the Texans can coverThere's no better unit in all of football than Houston's defense, which boasts No. 1 rankings in both scoring defense and total defense. The Texans have no holes on that side of the ball, with additional top-three rankings versus the run, versus the pass and on third downs. Houston also has a big edge in the all-important turnover differential metric at +7, compared to the Bills being at +1. Additionally, the Bills' No. 31 run defense could get a middling rush offense like Houston's going, and you can't ignore the recent history of this series. The Texans are 5-0 outright and 4-1 against the spread over their last five home games versus Buffalo. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Bills vs. Texans picksFor the NFL Week 12 'Thursday Night Football' game of Texans vs. Bills, the model is leaning Under the total, projecting 43 combined points.

    "body": "\n        Welcome to the College Football Hater Report: A breakdown of some of the players, teams and trends around the sport that deserve ire. If you're not a fellow pessimist, proceed with caution. This is inspired by Brad Botkin's NBA Hater Report. Steve Sarkisian thinks we're stupidDuring Monday's press conference, Texas coach Steve Sarkisian was asked why his 7-3 team had underachieved this season. Mid-question, he cut in.\"According to who?\" To be fair, it's not Sarkisian's job to care about the preseason AP Poll, where Texas was selected No. 1 for the first time in program history. It's not his job to pay attention to the expectations for his offense, which ranks 13th out of 16 teams in the SEC in yards per game since conference play started. It's not his job to read what people were saying about his program on the heels of a 35-10 loss at Georgia. And he was a day away from learning Texas would drop from No. 10 all the way to No. 17 in the latest College Football Playoff rankings, all but squashing any possible playoff argument out of Austin should the Longhorns win out. But it is Sarkisian's job to know that he took the No. 1 overall quarterback recruit and preseason Heisman contender and delivered a passing offense that rates bottom half in the conference. To see his program's offensive line play fell off a cliff the second that All-American tackle Kelvin Banks left. To realize his teams have 83 total yards rushing against Georgia in three matchups over the last 13 months. To understand that something is wrong with his vaunted defense, which has been exposed through the air in recent weeks. \nSarkisian is getting paid $10.8 million a year to diagnose and fix all these problems. An offseason solution, in this writer's opinion, would include hiring an offensive coordinator. He will be afforded every opportunity to get this program back to the CFP (and by the way, he adamantly said Wednesday he's not leaving). But there are more problems in Austin than at any point since Sarkisian got Texas rolling again, and that just should not be the case. Why play dumb? \nIf the only expectations Sarkisian cares about are his own, then how would he even define an underachievement? Well, an intrepid social media user went back to Nov. 22, 2021 -- almost four years ago to the day – when Sarkisian pretty explicitly laid out the expectations for his program. \"If I was in Year 4 of our program and I had three or four losses already right now and I was banging this drum of where we're going to be three or four years from now and we're still not there, then I would be concerned,\" Sarkisian said at the time. \"...in Year 4, if I'm sitting here with three or four losses, then I would probably be more concerned.\" \nLess than four years later, Texas is 7-3 and coming off a 25-point loss to No. 5 Georgia. Even one month ago, Sarkisian acknowledged the new reality for Texas, which had reached the CFP in 2023 and 2024. \"We've raised the bar from where we were when I got here to where we are now,\" Sarkisian said in October. \"We're a playoff team. That's what we are now. When that becomes the standard, we all have to go hold ourselves to that standard.\" On Monday, though, Sarkisian put the weight of any failed expectations at the feet of \"who voted us No. 1.\"\nSarkisian doesn't have to gaslight his fanbase. It's frustrating to have a disappointing season. But he's basked in enough success in recent years that it would not kill him acknowledge the bar deserves to be higher than 7-3 (with two games to go) after fielding one of the highest investment rosters in the history of college football. Julian Sayin doesn't have a real Heisman case\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            No. 1 Ohio State is the best team in college football, and it's not that close. The Buckeyes are obliterating opponents in all phases and are in great shape to join Georgia as the only back-to-back national champions of the playoff era. In the wake of their success, quarterback Julian Sayin has emerged as the program's candidate for the Heisman Trophy. Wide receiver Jeremiah Smith is the consensus best player in America, but his numbers are lackluster as the Buckeyes spread the ball. So, according to FanDuel, Sayin trails only Indiana's Fernando Mendoza in Heisman odds. \nFrankly, there's a really good case that Sayin is the best quarterback in America. The former five-star recruit is completing 80.1% of his passes for 2,675 yards, 25 touchdowns and only four interceptions. Sayin is on pace to shatter Bo Nix's completion percentage record. When he's called upon, he flashes with the best. The thing is, Sayin is almost never called upon. For a second, let's look at Ohio State's biggest games: No. 1 Texas, No. 17 Illinois and Washington. The Buckeyes approached all three of those games in the same way: They basically punted on the passing game! In those three games, Sayin threw the ball only 25 times per game with an average depth of target of 6.6 yards. Against all other FBS opponents, Sayin has thrown the ball 31.3 times per game for 9.4 yards per attempt. Sayin threw for only 166.7 yards per game in those three wins, compared to 311.5 in the six others. \nThat's not to say there's anything wrong with that. Credit to coach Ryan Day and his staff for putting Sayin in a position to succeed. When the time comes in the College Football Playoff, that game management will pay off, just like it did during a dominant CFP run last season. But certainly, there haven't been many Heisman Trophy winners that a team hid in high-leverage spots. Also, Sayin is -- at best -- the third-best player on his team. Smith and safety Caleb Downs are better by a wide margin. Receiver Carnell Tate and linebacker Arvell Reese have been awesome and could be early 2026 NFL Draft picks. Cases could be made for defensive linemen Caden Curry and Kayden McDonald, and linebacker Sonny Styles too. The Heisman Trophy is about being the most outstanding player in the country, and elevating a program to new heights. While Sayin is a star in the making, he is simply a luxury at Ohio State, not a necessity. There is time to change my mind here. Michigan in the season finale and then, likely, Indiana in the Big Ten Championship give the Buckeyes two marquee opportunities to let Sayin loose in a high-leverage spot -- should they even find themselves in one. \n            ",

On Wednesday, FBI director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the charges against Wedding, and the FBI is offering $15 million for information that leads to Wedding's arrest.Earlier this year, the FBI added Wedding to its Ten Most Wanted list and initially offered $10 million for information on his whereabouts. On Wednesday, Bondi called the former snowboarder \"one of the most prolific and violent drug trafficking organizers in the world,\" according to USA Today.Wedding, 44, is accused of trafficking drugs, primarily cocaine and fentanyl, between Mexico, the United States and Canada. Bondi stated that Wedding is the largest distributor of cocaine in his native country of Canada as he imports 60 metric tons of the drug from Mexico into the U.S. every year for a billion-dollar operation.\n        \n            \n                Ryan Wedding, ex-Olympic snowboarder, added to FBI's Ten Most Wanted amid drug trafficking, murder accusations\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBondi also alleged that Wedding is aided by the Mexican Sinola cartel, which is protecting him as the FBI continues its search.\nWedding is accused of killing a U.S. federal witness in Colombia. Authorities say the witness was murdered before he was able to testify against Wedding, and a $2 million reward is being offered for more information about the witness' murder. Prior to the witness' death, law enforcement recovered $15.2 million between physical assets and cryptocurrency.Here is the complete list of charges against Wedding, per USA Today.Conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaineConspiracy to export cocaineConspiracy to commit murder in connection with a continuing criminal enterprise and drug crimeMurder in connection with a continuing criminal enterprise and drug crimeConspiracy to tamper with a witness, victim, or informantTampering with a witness, victim, or informantConspiracy to retaliate against a witness, victim, or informantRetaliation against a witness, victim, or informantConspiracy to launder monetary instrumentsWedding allegedly has a lengthy list of aliases. Among them are \"El Jefe,\" \"Giant,\" 'Public Enemy,\" \"James Conrad King,\" and \"Jesse King.\"\nAt the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Wedding competed for Canada in men's parallel giant slalom.

The winners of each semifinal will advance to the final, also played as a single match, with the four path winners qualifying for the tournament.Based on the FIFA rankings, the 16 teams are divided into four pots as follows:Pot 1Pot 2Pot 3Pot 4ItalyPolandRepublic of IrelandRomaniaDenmarkWalesAlbaniaSwedenTurkyieCzechiaBosnia and HerzegovinaNorth MacedoniaUkraineSlovakiaKosovoNorthern IrelandThe four play-off paths will be formed in this way:Pot 1: the four top-seeded EQ teams are allocated to semifinals 1, 3, 5 and 7 in the order drawn.Pot 2: the four seeded EQ teams are drawn to the first available position of semifinals 2, 4, 6 and 8.Pot 3: the four unseeded EQ teams are drawn to the first available position of semifinals 2, 4, 6 and 8.Pot 4: the four unseeded UNL teams are drawn to the first available position of semifinals 1, 3, 5 and 7.When are the play-offs taking place? The playoffs will be played in a single-match format. Each path consists of two semifinals, with one seeded team facing one unseeded team. The seeded sides will host their respective semifinals, while the venue for each path's final will be determined in Thursday's draw. The semifinals are scheduled for Thursday, March 26, with the finals to follow on March 31.\nWorld Cup potsThe FIFA 2026 World Cup Final Draw will take place at the John F.

    "body": "\n        As Chelsea ready themselves to face a side who have for so long been the yardstick against which all other European clubs are measured, they might ask whether they are hitting their own standards, let alone the lofty ones that Barcelona continue to set.Sonia Bompastor's side are unbeaten in all competitions. They occupy one of the top four spots in the Champions League table that will guarantee them a quarterfinal berth with home advantage. The sky is hardly falling in. However, a 1-1 draw at Liverpool was a third draw in nine Women's Super League games, one that allowed Manchester City to open up a three-point lead at the top of the table. All four of those draws have been by the same scoreline, and of course, some 1-1 draws are different from others. It is one thing to get within three minutes of beating Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium, another to register just one shot on target against the league's bottom side. Both, however, speak to a broader trend that has emerged early in year two under Bompastor, the sense that this team lacks the ruthless edge that could take it beyond the likes of Barcelona.Certainly, they are not as free-scoring as past teams were. Their nine WSL games have delivered just 16 goals, exactly half of their tally at this stage of last season. Alyssa Thompson's goals in back-to-back games have certainly been welcome, but she cannot cover the holes in an attack that is feeling the absences of Mayra Ramirez (hamstring), Lauren James (ankle) and Guro Reiten, who welcomed the birth of her son earlier this month. Their absence is all the more profoundly felt as Sam Kerr continues to work her way back after nearly two years on the sidelines.\nNo wonder this side is taking fewer shots and carving out more infrequent chances than it has in recent years, and by a fair margin, their 16.3 shots per game a 15 percent drop from last season's side, who dropped as many points in all 22 games as this iteration have already in the WSL. And yet it is not quite as straightforward a tale of outright attacking drop off as the conflation of pure injuries and some off-color performances might suggest. The volume of openings Chelsea are making for themselves might have dropped. The quality of them has not.If anything, Chelsea are making better chances for themselves. A rise from 2.06 non-penalty expected goals (npxG) per WSL game to 2.2 npxG might be nothing more than a bit of variance; that latter is a small sample size after all. It could also be the case, though, that the story of this season so far is nothing more than some bad form in front of goal at the wrong moments, leading 27 goals from almost 32 xG. Aggie Beever-Jones, Wieke Kaptein, Catarina Macario, Sjoeke Nusken, Reiten: all have notably fewer actual goals than expected. Given the quality of these footballers, it is hard to believe that that won't change for most of them in the next few months.Shots taken by Chelsea this season, sized by xG value \n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            The worry coming out of the draw with Liverpool was that the data had it as a rather different game to the other 1-1s. This wasn't Chelsea hammering on the door for 20-odd shots and three-ish xG as it had been against Twente and Manchester United. It was a team who didn't really go anywhere for an hour against a team they would have expected to swat aside. No wonder Bompastor was keen to remind her players of what is expected after a bad result.\n\"At Chelsea, we are used to bouncing back really quickly,\" she said. \"It will be a tough challenge, but our job is to make sure we focus on the next one. We take the learnings from Sunday and we go into the next one ready to compete.\"That will certainly be a challenge against Barcelona, who sit atop the Champions League table with three wins from three, the only blemish on a winning season being a shock defeat at Real Sociedad. The Catalans might be strong favorites for this competition, but that defeat was a sign that they are not invulnerable. Rocked first by their defeat to Arsenal in May's European final and then by La Liga salary limits that forced six exits to the WSL, they may not be quite the same team that beat Chelsea 4-1 home and away in last season's Champions League semifinal.They might not be the team they were last season, but the question heading into Thursday night is whether Chelsea are either. Are they a team unfortunate to have run into a cold streak in the early weeks of an injury-hit campaign, or one who don't have the killer instinct to put to bed the worst team in the WSL? If it's the latter, this could be a trying night at Stamford Bridge indeed.\nViewing informationDate: Thursday, Nov. 20 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Stamford Bridge -- London, EnglandLive stream: Paramount+Odds: Chelsea +450; Draw +450; Barca -188\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The long-awaited College Sports Commission participation agreement, viewed as a critical piece for the future of college sports, was sent out Wednesday to the Power Four conference schools.  It has been months in the making and delayed, in part, over disagreements on what a penalty structure should look like. The hope is that all of the Power Four schools will sign it and turn it back in within the next two weeks, a critical time period with the early signing period starting Dec. 3 and the transfer portal window opening Jan. 2.The 11-page participation agreement obtained by CBS Sports allows the CSC to enforce agreed upon rules, prevents schools from circumventing the system to sue over enforcement decisions they didn't like (long a problem in the NCAA enforcement model) and requires annual audits of all schools that spent 75 percent or more of the annual rev-share number, among other measures. Notably, it states that it does not override existing state laws.The piece most critical to CSC CEO Bryan Seeley and his team would prevent schools from pursuing jury trials outside of the CSC enforcement and appeal process. There are arbitration opportunities for the schools and student-athletes, but ultimately every participating school will be bound by the final decisions made. Led by Seely, the CSC was created to enforce revenue-sharing and NIL-related issues in the aftermath of the landmark passing of the $2.8 billion House settlement. \nThe document states that if any participant (student-athlete, school or associated entities or state officials) brings any suit or claim against the CSC related to membership rules, investigation or enforcement actions, it would \"forgo and not receive any and all revenue from its conference and not be eligible to compete in the post-season in the sport(s) involved in the investigation or decision.\"Conference commissioners, athletic directors and others hope all 68 Power 4 schools will sign off on the agreement and bring stability to a landscape where litigation -- or the threat of it -- has made it nearly impossible for the NCAA to enforce rules, from NIL to eligibility and everything in between.Once the agreements are signed, Seely and his team will have the runway to crank up the enforcement efforts and prevent salary cap circumvention, among other issues. Currently, every school that opts into the House settlement is able to spend up to $20.5 million annually on direct payments to student-athletes. \nAhead of the House settlement, many programs turned to a popular strategy known as \"front-loading,\" spending as much of their NIL dollars as possible before entering a world where every deal of $600 or more must be submitted to and reviewed by the NIL Go clearinghouse. With the CSC unable to enforce its rules so far, some within the industry have discussed continuing to spend significant NIL \"pay-for-play\" money without making it subject to NIL Go's fair-market-value review.There must be a compelling reason for everyone -- from schools to their most active boosters -- to follow the rules, and an enforceable penalty structure is one way to provide it.The penalties available to the CSC were not detailed in the agreement sent to schools on Wednesday, but they are expected to be finalized soon and codified as NCAA bylaws. One holdup in the participant agreement, sources told CBS Sports, was hesitation within the Big Ten to endorse postseason bans as a potential punishment. After months of discussion, the four power conferences ultimately agreed after limiting the circumstances of a possible postseason ban to: the most egregious violations, disregarding penalties and purposefully obstructing and/or not cooperating with investigations. \nAccording to those familiar with the expected structure, penalties could include a limited postseason ban, financial penalties for schools and individuals, restrictions on the number of transfers a program can take and more. One particularly notable consequence expected to be included is a reduction in how much revenue-share money a school can allocate to a specific team. The CSC cannot reduce the overall $20.5 million cap, but if violations are deemed severe, it could restrict a football program to, for example, 20% of the cap instead of the 75–80% most Power Four schools currently spend.\n            ",

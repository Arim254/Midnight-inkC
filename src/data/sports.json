The U.S. women's national team player delivered a stunning equalizer against Racing Louisville FC, which snatched a critical point in a 2-2 draw and ensured Gotham's place in the 2025 NWSL postseason. Lavelle scored the goal off a dead-ball situation. Gotham earned a free kick in a dangerous spot in the final third, and the veteran midfielder took her place over the mark. She struck the ball with her left for a clinical finish, showing off equal parts technical brilliance and sheer will. \nShe showed her veteran presence in a big moment and only needed a little step to get behind a sensational effort. The goalkeeper was frozen for just a moment, perhaps wondering if Lavelle would go far post, and that little hesitation gave the American star enough time to curl the ball over the wall and into the goal.\nWith the draw, Gotham are on 36 points and are currently the seven seed ahead of the final day of the regular season on Nov. 2. Thanks to conceding that late goal, the dropped points leave Louisville in the eighth spot, ahead of the last game with the North Carolina Courage two points back.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Week 7 of the Fantasy Football season brought some new players to the forefont with breakout performances that belong on your Fantasy Football radar now. On the Fantasy side, we received more data on how each offense plans to utilize its personnel. Our expectations for backfield touches, targets in the pass game, snap shares, and overall usage are often not met, and that's when we have to pivot.In Week 7, several players jumped on the Fantasy Football radar. This could be the start of something special for some of these players, and you'll want to get well ahead of your Week 8 Fantasy Football waiver wire by putting these players on your radar. For more on every player we discuss below, you'll want to make sure to check out Jamey Eisenberg's in-depth waiver wire column on Monday afternoon.Oronde Gadsden II, TE, ChargersAfter breaking out in Week 6, I was surprised to see Gadsden still available in so many leagues even leading up to Week 7 Sunday kickoffs. I can understand the hesitation considering how many options are available to Justin Herbert in the pass game, but Gadsden is quickly proving to be one of their best. Gadsden provides Herbert a mismatch as he can be matched up against linebackers in man coverage. With defenses focused on stopping the top-three trio of Chargers receivers, Gadsden has found a way to shine with a quarterback who is willing to go through his full progression and get past his first and second reads. Gadsden turned his Week 6 breakout into an even bigger one in Week 7 when he went off for six receptions, 156 receiving yards and a touchdown on eight targets. He will be the top priority waiver addition at any position this week.Xavier Legette, WR, PanthersLegette showed signs of developing as Bryce Young's No. 2 target in Carolina's Week 7 win. He turned 11 targets into nine receptions for 92 yards and a touchdown. He is starting to develop as a strong option for Young in the red zone but in Week 7 he showed he can be more than that. Legette played a key role as a chain mover and turned double-digit targets into nine receptions and nearly 100 yards. That's someone worth rostering as attrition continues and bye weeks make those FLEX decisions much harder. Kyle Monangai, RB, BearsThe Bears came out of the bye last week and showed some signs of getting their rookie back more involved. That continued in Week 7. Monangai saw 13 rushing attempts and turned them into 81 yards and a touchdown. He also saw three targets in the pass game, catching two of them for 13 yards. Monangai is worth rostering as a handcuff but is quickly proving to be a capable back-end FLEX option when the Bears have a positive gamescript in the matchup ahead and 2. \nBrashard Smith, RB, ChiefsWhen the Chiefs drafted Smith -- the former collegiate wide out turned running back -- their director of player personnel made it clear that Andy Reid envisioned a role for him early on. The Chiefs are paying up on that promise already not even halfway through the season. Smith's role has grown in each passing week and in Week 7 he saw a career high 14 rushing attempts. Smith's value will come mostly via the pass game where he turned five targets into five receptions for 42 receiving yards. Smith is a priority add in all PPR leagues.Chimere Dike, WR, TitansDike was the first receiver the Titans drafted this past May after drafting Cam Ward, but he fell behind on the depth chart this offseason. However, he offers an over-the-top type speed that fits Ward's arm talent. With Calvin Ridley out, Dike got his opportunity in Week 7 and turned four receptions into 70 yards and a touchdown. Daniel Bellinger, TE, Giants Bellinger helped kickstart the Giants pass game in Week 7 and finished with 88 yards receiving and a touchdown on three receptions. Bellinger came inches away from hauling in his second touchdown pass later that game. With the Giants dealing with so many injuries on the receiver front, Bellinger could emerge as a favorite target for Dart. \nJoe Flacco, QB, BengalsThis Flacco-Bengals thing sure looks it's going to work out. Flacco lit the Steelers up for 342 passing yards and three touchdowns in Week 7. Flacco should be added in all leagues where you need quarterback help. In the right matchup, he can easily find himself as a top-12 option given the receivers he has to work with, the way the Bengals call their offense, and the state of the Bengals defense. \n            ",

I'm not expecting Trevon to be out long,\" Jones said.\n\"Yeah, I'm a Trevon fan,\" Schottenheimer said. \"I'm excited to get him back, and hopefully it won't be too long.\" \n            \n    ",

He chose wisely, awarding the ball to Bears defensive coordinator and former Saints coach Dennis Allen. Allen was fired by the Saints on Nov. 4, 2024 following the ninth game of his third season leading the team. He relished the opportunity to face his former team as his defense forced four turnovers while holding the Saints to just 16 first downs, 253 total yards and 3 of 10 on third down. On the heels of that performance, Allen gave a passionate speech to his players in the postgame locker room.\n\"Sometimes, the good lord just has a freaking plan for you that you don't know about,\" Allen said. \"Sometimes, you ain't good enough for somewhere else. That's perfectly fine. I love being here. I love being with this group of guys. You guys work your damn asses off, but four [wins] ain't enough! Moving on to the next one!\" \nAllen was alluding to the Bears' four-game winning that has put them in the thick of things in the NFC North race at 4-2. Johnson is vying to lead Chicago to its first winning season since 2018 and the franchise's first playoff berth since 2020. \nWhile Allen is enjoying success in Chicago, the Saints are mired in a 1-6 start. Specifically, it's been tough sledding for the Saints' offense, as the unit has failed to score at least 20 points five times this season. \n            \n    ",

The former first-round pick by Tampa Bay in the 2012 NFL Draft played seven NFL seasons prior to his career ending after a brief stint with the Oakland Raiders.Martin rushed for 1,454 yards as a rookie in 2012 before playing in only 17 games over his next two years with the Buccaneers. Martin's resurgence was notable in 2015 when he posted an All-Pro and Pro Bowl season in which he rushed for 1,402 yards. \nThat offseason, Tampa Bay signed Martin to a five-year, $35 million contract extension. Martin struggled thereafter for the NFC South franchise, including a suspension for violation of the league's substance abuse policy that caused him to miss multiple games at the end of the year. The suspension came amid Martin being benched while the Buccaneers were making a playoff push during the 2016 season. The Buccaneers released Martin after the 2017 season and he later signed with the Raiders to back up Marshawn Lynch.Known for his bruising style at 5-feet-9 and 225 pounds, Martin starred at Boise State and earned the nickname \"Muscle Hamster\" during his time on the blue turf. \nPrior to Heisman finalist Ashton Jeanty's career, Martin was considered one of the top ballcarriers in program history after ranking third all-time at the school with 43 rushing touchdowns and 48 total touchdowns, fifth with 3,431 rushing yards and sixth with 617 rushing attempts.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        ARLINGTON, Texas -- When Dallas Cowboys All-Pro kicker Brandon Aubrey drained a 64-yard field goal to send Dallas to overtime in an eventual 40-37 overtime victory over the New York Giants in Week 2, wide receiver CeeDee Lamb called Aubrey \"a GOAT.\"It's only Aubrey's third NFL season in 2025, but in Dallas' 44-22 victory over the Washington Commanders on Sunday afternoon, he added another bullet point to a growing resume that backs up Lamb's claim. Aubrey calmly drilled a 61-yard field goal that put Dallas up 20-8 midway through the second quarter that became his fifth made kick from at least 60 yards out. That's the most field goals from 60 yards or deeper in NFL history. Even the league's official X/Twitter account added the phrase \"with ease\" when posting the highlight of his kick.  \"It's going to be a living record with kickers getting better and better every year. It's going to be tough to hold on to that one with just five,\" Aubrey said postgame on Sunday. \"It feels good. It feels like I've set myself apart with a particular set of skills, I guess, that are hard to replicate, so I just want to keep showing that every week.\"\nCowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones finds himself surprised that he no longer feels stunned when Dallas trots out their kicker from 60-plus yards. That's a testament to Aubrey. \n\"I tell you it doesn't surprise me, and that's ironic when we step out there [from 60-plus yards],\" Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones said postgame. All Dallas coach Brian Schottenheimer could do when asked about Aubrey breaking the record is smile, laugh and shake his head thinking about the latest history Aubrey made in Week 7. \"Let's talk about the weapon. What's the record, most 60-yard field goals in a career? The guy is incredible, he really is. He's incredible,\" Schottenheimer said postgame. \"Dak [Prescott] and I kind of laugh because literally when we get the ball, it's like, he's like, 50 [yard line]. I'm like, 'yeah, 50.' ... So, he's just, he's amazing.\" \nAmong Aubrey's crazy accomplishments are the following: Aubrey made an NFL-record 35 field goals in a row to begin his career. Aubrey's 14 made field goals from 50 yards or deeper in 2024 are the most ever in a season in NFL history. He owns the longest made field goal in Cowboys history, a 65-yarder he made in Week 3 last season against the Baltimore Ravens, the second-longest made field goal in NFL history. Five career made field goals from 60 yards or deeper, the most in NFL history.He's now connected on 91 of his 100 field goal attempts in his career. No one has attempted or made more field goals than Aubrey since he entered the NFL in 2023. \"My goal has always been to be at 90%, so we're doing just good enough to meet that goal,\" he said. \"Hopefully I can keep that going for my career.\"Brandon Aubrey career, NFL ranksNFL ranks since 2023Made field goals911stField goal attempts1001stField goal pct91%3rd*Made field goals of 50 yards or deeper291stMade field goals of 60 yards or deeper51st* Among 18 kickers with least 70 field goal attempts since 2023The only difference Aubrey feels when booting a kick from 60 yards or deeper is Dallas long snapper Trent Sieg's enthusiasm on the ensuing celebratory helmet tap after the kick goes through the uprights. \"My long snapper definitely hits my head harder, so yes,\" Aubrey said when asked if he feels a difference. His range at AT&T Stadium, as Schottenheimer said, is the 50 where the Cowboys' star sits right in the middle of the turf. Aubrey's star will continue growing brighter and brighter the longer he keeps rewriting the NFL's all-time record books.\"It feels like that is now well within my range,\" Aubrey said. \"It's something I expect myself to make, so it feels like I'm doing my process and treating it like any other kick.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        What's happening at Florida State is a perfect illustration of how fluid the idea of job security is in college football's new era.  The Seminoles were an early-season darling after a convincing Week 1 win over Alabama and raced off to a 3-0 start -- exactly what coach Mike Norvell needed coming off a 2-10 2024 campaign.  Then came an overtime loss to Virginia. Then Miami. Then Pittsburgh. At that point, the heat had turned up to about medium on Norvell -- no immediate firing, but perhaps in danger after this season if all hell broke loose, and if nothing else the lead face of all 2026 hot seat content.  But now things are at a scalding temperature. In the early hours of Sunday morning, on the East Coast at least, Florida State lost 20-13 to lowly Stanford, a game the Seminoles were favored to win by 17.5 points.  \nThe fourth straight loss (the fourth time Norvell's had a four-game losing streak in Tallahassee) was, in the words of one industry source, when Norvell's seat went from warm to \"legit fire hot.\" It's a long flight from Palo Alto to Tallahassee. Many boosters, per sources, spent those trips back commiserating and planning. Conversations in Tallahassee about Norvell's status have continued throughout the day; Norvell even acknowledged during a Sunday staff meeting that conversations about his future were happening, sources tell CBS Sports. His buyout of around $55 million, per Noles247, no longer seems like a major roadblock to making a change many around the program view as necessary.   🏈 💰Most Expensive Buyouts in College Football History RankCoachSchoolBuyout Amount1 \t\t\t\tJimbo Fisher \t\t\t\tTexas A&M \t\t\t\t$76.8 million \t\t\t\t2 \t\t\t\tJames Franklin \t\t\t\tPenn State \t\t\t\t$49 million \t\t\t\t3 \t\t\t\tGus Malzahn \t\t\t\tAuburn \t\t\t\t$21.4 million \t\t\t\t4 \t\t\t\tCharlie Weis \t\t\t\tNotre Dame \t\t\t\t$18.9 million \t\t\t\t5 \t\t\t\tWillie Taggart \t\t\t\tFlorida State \t\t\t\t$18 million \t\t\t\t6 \t\t\t\tEd Orgeron \t\t\t\tLSU \t\t\t\t$16.9 million \t\t\t\t7 \t\t\t\tTom Allen \t\t\t\tIndiana \t\t\t\t$15.5 million \t\t\t\t8 \t\t\t\tTom Herman \t\t\t\tTexas \t\t\t\t$15.4 million \t\t\t\t9 \t\t\t\tBryan Harsin \t\t\t\tAuburn \t\t\t\t$15.3 million \t\t\t\t10 \t\t\t\tArt Briles \t\t\t\tBaylor \t\t\t\t$15.1 million \t\t\t\tSome believe Norvell's message is getting lost on his team. After the loss to Stanford, a source told CBS Sports that players were cracking jokes in the locker room about having to \"respond\" yet again. \"Respond\" is a common phrase for Norvell to his team as losses mount. CBS Sports' Brandon Marcello, who spent Saturday in the ACC replay center, said on the College Football Insiders that he could see Florida State's sideline in the All-22 camera view and was struck by the lack of player engagement.  Florida State is 5-14 going back to the start of the 2024 season.  \nThe Seminoles again went all-in with the portal this offseason, signing 23 transfers to turn the program around. But just like it saw in 2024, part of the risk of a transfer-heavy strategy is that one-year rentals aren't steeped in the program culture, which matters when things go sideways. As for the on-field business, this is not a cheap roster. Between rev share and front-loaded name, image and likeness payments, sources say FSU's roster cost well into the $20 million range.  The combination of expensive additions and compounding losses puts Norvell in the crosshairs, especially when you consider there are no easy fix moves remaining after Norvell changed both of his coordinators last offseason. If the Seminoles fire Norvell, it would cost the program far more than just that $55 million. They would spend millions buying out assistant coach contracts. There are also multiyear deals for Seminole players on the roster the next head coach might not want to keep. Add in a new coach, his staff and a full portal class of salaries and it could cost close to nine figures to fire Norvell.  That's a staggering sum for a program, less than a year ago, that openly rebelled against the ACC to generate more revenue. Fifty-five million would be the second-largest buyout in college football history. But it's a number some around Tallahassee consider necessary with no sustained signs of improvement.  \n        \n            \n                The Buyout Bubble: Why college football keeps paying millions to make coaches disappear\n                \n                    Brandon Marcello                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nCould Norvell survive? Absolutely. Firings in college football are inherently political, and Norvell could claw his way out of this. But even if he escapes Sunday with his job intact, Norvell isn't necessarily safe given that the Seminoles are on a bye week, an opportune time to make a change no matter the day.  Norvell looks like he'll make it through Sunday. Monday, Tuesday and the rest of the year after that? We'll see. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Noles247 brings fans trusted coverage from a dedicated team of insiders who are all over the latest with Norvell and Florida State.  With 10+ years of experience and a staff that includes Chris Nee, Brendan Sonnone and Zach Blostein, the site delivers daily updates, recruiting scoop, team and transfer intel.

Thomas' induction into the Ring of Fame served as the highlight of the franchise's Alumni Weekend, which included the franchise honoring the 10th anniversary of its Super Bowl 50-winning team.Thomas, the Broncos' first round pick in the 2010 NFL Draft, was honored as part of a special halftime ceremony honoring Denver's Super Bowl 50 team, which saw Thomas' name unveiled in the Level 5 facade of Empower Field at Mile High. Thomas, who died in 2021 at the age of 33 from complications of a seizure disorder, was represented by his parents Katina Smith and Bobby Thomas.\nThe unveiling of Thomas' name in the Ring of Fame came after his pillar in the Broncos' Ring of Fame Plaza was unveiled to the public on Sunday morning. Thomas was also recognized at a private reception on Saturday night which saw Thomas' parents be presented with his Ring of Fame jacket and ring by team owners Greg Penner and Carrie Walton Penner.\nIn a career that saw him play in two Super Bowls, Thomas was one of the Broncos' most prolific players of their most recent championship era, as he was the most prominent star receiver to throw to for Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Peyton Manning and others. Thomas was a five-time Pro Bowler and two-time Second-Team All-Pro, with five 1,000-yard receiving seasons in a row from 2012 to 2016. Thomas was also a playoff hero for the Broncos, as his 80-yard catch-and-run to beat the Pittsburgh Steelers in the 2011 Wild Card round gave the Broncos a dramatic victory that capped off their improbable success that year with quarterback and cultural phenomenon Tim Tebow.\nThomas played for the Broncos until 2018, when he was traded midseason to the Houston Texans before ending his career with the New England Patriots and New York Jets in 2019. Thomas, who ranks second in Broncos history in career receiving yards (9,055) and receiving touchdowns (60) while also possessing the third-most career receptions (665), becomes the 38th member of the Broncos Ring of Fame and the 13th first-ballot selection.\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Another Sunday, another full slate of NFL action nearly in the books. And Week 7 has had no shortage of major storylines so far: After Joe Flacco and the Cincinnati Bengals outdueled Aaron Rodgers and the Pittsburgh Steelers to kick off this week's schedule, a couple of other surprising teams stole the spotlight, including the Cleveland Browns against the sinking Miami Dolphins.Some results were fairly predictable, like Mike Vrabel leading a decisive win over his old team, the Tennessee Titans, thanks to another crisp performance from quarterback Drake Maye. Others were a bit more eye-opening, like the Los Angeles Rams laying waste to the Jacksonville Jaguars overseas, despite the latter entering the international contest with a promising 4-2 record. And then there were the literal no-contest matchups, like the Kansas City Chiefs blanking the rival Las Vegas Raiders in a 31-0 shutout.Which players, coaches and teams were the biggest winners (and losers) of Week 7? Here are our top picks for the most noteworthy standouts of Sunday's matchups, for both better and worse:Winner: Bo NixDown 19 points in the fourth quarter? No worries. Nix has built a reputation as a late-game fighter, and it showed up in a big way on Sunday, when the New York Giants looked poised to run away with a road upset against his Denver Broncos. The second-year quarterback led five straight scoring drives and totaled four of his own touchdowns to fuel the Broncos' massive comeback.\nLoser: Brian DabollThe embattled Giants coach may be best friends with hotshot rookie Jaxson Dart, but his seat may heat up after his squad surrendered 33 points in the fourth quarter of a would-be win over Denver. His handpicked emergency kicker, Jude McAtamney, missed two extra points. And it can be hard to overcome the kind of gut punch the locker room will feel after an \"L\" like this.Winner: Brian SchottenheimerWhy aren't we talking more about what this guy's doing -- or at least enjoying -- at the helm of the Dallas Cowboys? America's Team may still lack a playoff-caliber defense, but Dak Prescott has been slinging it like MVP material for most of the year. That continued against the rival Washington Commanders, with Javonte Williams, CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens all making splash plays.Loser: The CommandersSunday was a double whammy for Washington. Not only did Dan Quinn's team, which finished 2024 on the doorstep of the Super Bowl, look increasingly old and slow playing catch-up with the Cowboys, but star quarterback Jayden Daniels also left with a hamstring injury. That's Daniels' second significant injury of the year, and we're not even to the midway point of 2025 just yet.\nWinner: Andy ReidReid's Chiefs looked like they might finally be returning to title-caliber form in a prime-time rout of the Detroit Lions in Week 6. Everything finally clicked against the Raiders, though, with Patrick Mahomes greatly benefiting from the 2025 debut of Rashee Rice. The formerly suspended wide receiver showed up with seven catches and two scores to balance out Reid's offensive arsenal.Loser: Tua TagovailoaEach week has basically been a new low for the Miami Dolphins quarterback, both on and off the field. Fresh off a public apology for implying his teammates were slacking off in the building, Tagovailoa tossed three picks in a hapless blowout loss to none other than the Cleveland Browns. Back-breaking turnovers have been his 2025 calling card.Winner: Matthew StaffordNo Puka Nacua? No problem for the Los Angeles Rams quarterback, who gave London a show for the ages despite rainy conditions against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Stafford may be 37, but he slung it like he was 27 on the international stage, tossing five scores, including three to Davante Adams. He also felt zero pressure, getting elite defensive support to the tune of seven sacks.\nLoser: Aaron GlennLook, we're not going to sit here and suggest all rebuilds are effective overnight; Glenn's old team, the Detroit Lions, endured lots of bumps before emerging as a real contender. But after Sunday's ugly 13-6 loss to the Carolina Panthers, in which he finally benched Justin Fields despite repeatedly assuring reporters he would not, Glenn became the first Jets coach to ever start 0-7.Winner: The Eagles' passing gamePhiladelphia produced some scarily erratic passing work in a two-game skid prior to Sunday, especially considering the wealth of talent in their lineup. Up against Brian Flores' exotic Minnesota Vikings defense, however, Jalen Hurts really settled in, distributing one timely dart after another to both A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith. They enjoyed their most fluid aerial attack in a long time.Loser: The TitansWas Tennessee right to move on from Mike Vrabel after the 2023 season? You can still make that case. But there's no denying Vrabel finds himself in a much better place than his former organization. Making their first appearance under the interim direction of Mike McCoy, the Titans once again lost the ball with rookie Cam Ward under center, gifting an easy win to Vrabel's Patriots.\nWinner: Ben JohnsonThe Chicago Bears aren't necessarily winning pretty. But any Chi-Town resident would've signed up for a 4-2 start in a heartbeat. Even with quarterback Caleb Williams posting a so-so stat line against the New Orleans Saints on Sunday, Johnson kept the ground game churning through both D'Andre Swift and Kyle Monangai, while his defensive guru, Dennis Allen, also showed up.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Denver Broncos pulled off one of the most unlikely comebacks in NFL history on Sunday. The Broncos were able to beat the New York Giants 33-32 despite the fact that they were trailing 19-0 going into the fourth quarter. Here are five wild stats to know from Denver's win, including two NFL records that the Broncos set. NFL record: Broncos' fourth-quarter explosionGoing into the fourth quarter, the Broncos were trailing 19-0 and it didn't look like they had a chance to win the game, but then they exploded for 33 points during the final quarter to win. It was the most points ever scored by a team that had been shut out through the first three quarters. The Broncos broke a record that had been held by the 1981 Atlanta Falcons, who got shut out for three quarters by the Green Bay Packers before scoring 31 in the final quarter. The Broncos and Falcons are the only two teams in NFL history to score at least 30 points after scoring zero in the first three quarters. \nNFL record, Part II: Bo Nix goes offThe Broncos were able to score 33 points thanks in large part to Bo Nix, who had one of the best fourth-quarter performances in NFL history. Not only did Nix throw for 174 yards and two touchdowns in the final quarter, but he also rushed for 46 yards and two MORE touchdowns. \nWith those four scores, Nix became the first player in NFL history with two passing touchdowns AND two rushing touchdowns in any quarter ever. Broncos' fourth-quarter point total almost broke recordAs we've already mentioned multiple times, the Broncos scored 33 points during the fourth quarter, which isn't a record, but it was the second most points that any team has ever scored during the fourth quarter of a game in NFL history. The only team to score more came in 2007 when the Detroit Lions scored 34 points in the fourth quarter during a 34-14 win over the Chicago Bears. \nComeback kidsThe Broncos were trailing 26-8 with just six minutes left to play and still managed to win, making them just the second team since 2000 to win a game after trailing 18 points or more in the final six minutes. The only other time that's happened over the past 25 years came in 2003 when Peyton Manning led the Colts back from a 21-point deficit in the final six minutes during a 38-35 win over the Buccaneers. NFL teams had lost 1,602 consecutive games when trailing by 18 points or more in the final six minutes, but that streak ended on Sunday. Comeback kids, Part IIThe win over the Giants marked the second time this month that the Broncos have won a game despite trailing by at least 14 points heading into the fourth quarter (The Broncos trailed the Eagles 17-3 going into the fourth quarter back in Week 5 before winning the game, 21-17). The Broncos are just the third team since the AFL-NFL merger to overcome a deficit of 14 points or more in the fourth quarter of two different games in the same month. \nThe only other teams to pull that off are the Bears (September 2020) and the Dolphins (September 1980). The win over the Giants marked the first time since 1983 that the Broncos won a game despite trailing by at least 19 points heading into the fourth quarter. It was a huge win for the Broncos, who are now sitting atop the AFC West with a one-game lead over both the Chargers and the Chiefs. \n            ",

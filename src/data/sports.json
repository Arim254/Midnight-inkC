    "body": "\nTeams streaking in opposite directions will meet on 'Monday Night Football' as the San Francisco 49ers visit the Indianapolis Colts. The Niners (10-4) have won four straight, all of them coming by multiple scores, including a 37-24 win over Tennessee in Week 15. The Colts (8-6), meanwhile, are riding a four-game losing streak and fell to Seattle, 18-16, last week. Quarterback Philip Rivers, who came out of retirement last week following Daniel Jones' Achilles injury, will start again for the Colts with rookie Riley Leonard backing him up. Cornerback Sauce Gardner (calf) is out for Indianapolis. Ricky Pearsall (knee, ankle) is out for the Niners. Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis. The latest 49ers vs. Colts odds from DraftKings Sportsbook have San Francisco as the 4.5-point road favorite, while the over/under for total points scored is 46. Before making any Colts vs. 49ers     picks, be sure to see the NFL predictions from SportsLine's projection model.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

San Fran also has a huge primetime advantage when it comes to the spread, as it has covered in all three such games this year, while Indy is 0-5 ATS over its last five under the bright lights of primetime. Despite batting major injuries all year, the Niners still rank among the top four in both third-down offense and passing offense. The Colts' offense should have difficulty keeping up with the 49ers as Indianapolis has scored 20 or fewer points in four straight games. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why the Colts can coverThe Colts have owned this series recently, winning five straight overall matchups and going 9-3 over the last dozen home meetings. Indy controls the trenches, leading the NFL in rushing touchdowns while ranking second by allowing just 3.7 yards per rush. The ground game is already a struggle for the 49ers, who rank 31st with 3.5 yards per carry, and Rivers should find more success in his second week back. He's had a full week in the practice facility, is at home instead of a hostile environment like Seattle, and the Niners rank dead last in the NFL in defensive sacks. See which team to back at SportsLine. How to make Colts vs. 49ers           picksFor 49ers vs. Colts   on 'Monday Night Football,' the model is leaning Over the total, projecting 52 combined points.

    "body": "\n        One of Nick Saban's forgotten coaching disciples prior to his magical two-year run at Indiana, Curt Cignetti credits the Alabama legend with helping him set up his own process behind the scenes as the leader of a program while instituting principles that have led to sizable wins.As the anchor of the top-seeded and unbeaten Hoosiers entering next week's College Football Playoff quarterfinal matchup with the Crimson Tide at the Rose Bowl, Cignetti has not forgotten his early roots in the coaching ranks.\"[He's a] real important part of my journey,\" Cignetti said Monday. \"[I] learned a lot from Coach Saban in terms of organization and standards. I wouldn't be where I am today without my time under Nick. My family really enjoyed Tuscaloosa.\"Cut from the same no BS cloth as Saban, Cignetti reportedly flourished in a \"sink-or-swim environment\" as an assistant coach and recruiting advisor at Alabama in 2007 and it was there he saw what turned out to be the makings of an eventual college football dynasty.\nIn fact, it was Cignetti who was the lead recruiter for future Alabama Heisman winner Mark Ingram, the running back who helped the Crimson Tide to the first of six national titles under Saban in 2009.\"He was knowledgeable about recruiting and knew everybody on the board because he was sending us out,\" former Alabama running backs coach Burton Burns told CBS Sports' John Talty last year. \"He was built for the job, it was in his DNA. He knew how to do all those things. He was really good on the road. I went on the road a few times with him, and he was really good with coaches and the family of those kids.\"Alabama was Cignetti's third coaching stop in the Power conference ranks and he spent five years on Saban's offensive staff before becoming a head coach for the first time at IUP in 2011. After turning that program around and finding success at Elon and James Madison, Indiana took a chance of Cignetti ahead of the 2024 campaign and he's done the rest.\nCignetti's won 24 of his first 26 games with the Hoosiers entering the Jan. 1 Rose Bowl and pushed Indiana to its first outright Big Ten title since 1945 this season. Cignetti has another Heisman winner to boot in quarterback Fernando Mendoza, whom he plucked out of the transfer portal from California last cycle and has watched the 6-foot-5 junior throw for 2,980 yards and 33 touchdowns this fall.The transfer portal has been Cignetti's primary strength at Indiana, according to Saban.\"I think when you're having that many changes on your roster every year, you have to do a fantastic job of evaluation, which Curt Cignetti has done that so far,\" Saban said earlier this season on College GameDay. \"I don't think you could change a program as quickly as he has Indiana, especially one that doesn't have a tradition of success and culture as a football program without transfer portal.\n\"We need new players, quick players. We need to be able to do this quickly. And he brought a bunch of players from his old school that knew his culture and how he wanted to do it. And got a quarterback in there that could make some plays. Now he has an even better quarterback, in my opinion.\"On the heels of consecutive top-30 portal signing classes where player evaluation was paramount, Cignetti says his sales pitch at Indiana is unique -- and awfully blunt.\"I used to tell them everybody can't play for the Yankees, man,\" Cignetti said earlier this season. \"I mean, that's the way it is. So don't come here if this is not what you want to do, because the standard is high. The commitment has got to be high.\"\n            ",

Kick is set for 2 p.m. on Dec. 31 in El Paso, Texas. Additionally, Dec. 27 is one of the most stacked days of the year as eight bowl games will take place on that day, including the Pop-Tarts Bowl, Texas Bowl and Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl Presented By Gin & Juice By Dre and Snoop (yes, that's its official name). \n\n        \n            \n                College Football Playoff bracket: Indiana, Ohio State, Georgia, Texas Tech earn byes; Miami in over Notre Dame\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBelow is a detailed look at the complete schedule for the 2025-26 college football bowl season, including dates, locations and TV channels.

    "body": "\nThe last chance to make a Week 16 NFL SGP comes on 'Monday Night Football' as the San Francisco 49ers visit the Indianapolis Colts (4.5, 46.5) at 8:15 p.m. ET. Both teams are on streaks, as San Fran has won four straight, while Indy has lost four straight. That would make NFL picks on the money line in favor of the Niners attractive for a 'Monday Night Football' SGP, but the recent history of this matchup may suggest otherwise. The Colts have won five straight games versus the Niners, so your MNF same-game parlay may want to consider NFL props, spread picks and the over/under.While this game features the likes of Christian McCaffrey, Jonathan Taylor and George Kittle, many will target 44-year-old Philip Rivers with prop bets for their MNF SGP. After 120 passing yards last week, Rivers' O/U for passing yards is 158.5 for Monday. San Fran's defense isn't the same caliber as the one in Seattle that Rivers saw last Sunday, so the Over could be appealing for your NFL same-game parlay. Before locking in any Colts vs. 49ers picks for your 'Monday Night Football' SGP, be sure to see the 49ers vs. Colts prop predictions powered by SportsLine's Machine Learning AI.New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins to bet on props like Jonathan Taylor as an anytime touchdown scorer:\nBuilt using cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques by SportsLine's Data Science team, AI Predictions and AI Ratings are generated for each player prop. Now, the model has analyzed Colts vs. 49ers on 'Monday Night Football' and locked in three confident best bets for an NFL SGP. If you successfully parlay its picks, you'd be looking at a payout of well over 6-1. You can only see the Machine Learning Model player prop predictions for San Francisco vs. Indianapolis here.Top Monday Night Football SGP picksAfter simulating 49ers vs. Colts, SportsLine AI says Niners running back Christian McCaffrey goes Under 17.5 carries (+102). With the postseason in their sights, the Niners are giving backup, Brian Robinson Jr., more touches in order to keep McCaffrey fresh for the playoffs. The former Commander has at least seven carries in each of his last five games, after reaching that number just twice over his first nine contests. Additionally, Indy's defensive strengths and weaknesses may have San Francisco lean on McCaffrey more thru the air than on the ground.The Colts have the No. 6 run defense and have allowed the second-fewest rushing touchdowns in 2025. On the other hand, the Colts have the second-worst pass defense, and San Fran will need more out of McCaffrey through the air with Ricky Pearsall (knee/ankle) out.

SportsLine's advanced computer model is backing Rivers and Colts to keep the game competitive, playing the Colts as 5.5-point underdogs as a part of its Monday NFL best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook. The over/under for Colts vs. 49ers is 46 points, down a half-point from the opening line.The model also has one of its Monday best bets coming from NBA action, backing the Oklahoma City Thunder to cover as 15.5-point favorites against the Memphis Grizzlies.

The Colts kept the Seahawks out of the end zone for the entire game, resulting in six Seattle field goals and culminating with Jason Myers needing to convert a 56-yard kick with 18 seconds left for the win. Rivers completed 66.7 percent of his passes (18 of 27) for 120 yards, but commanded the offense enough to have the Colts in the game late. Jonathan Taylor rushed for 87 yards, and the model expects Rivers and the offense to make enough plays to keep this contest close as well.

Oklahoma City still has a chance at a historic season after winning 24 of its first 25 games and opening the season at 25-3 after winning last year's NBA championship. The Grizzlies are without Ja Morant (ankle), and they are coming off a 130-122 home loss on Saturday to the Wizards, which resulted in just Washington's fifth win of the season.

    "body": "\n        After spending 62 years in Kansas City, Missouri, the Chiefs have announced that they are moving to Kansas after the team made a deal to build a new football stadium with the help of government tax revenue. On Monday, a committee of top Kansas lawmakers approved the subsidy deal with the Chiefs. The Legislative Coordinating Council, after meeting in executive session to hear the details of the deal in secret, voted unanimously to \"approve the STAR bond and STAR bond district for the sport stadium to support the Kansas City Chiefs.\"\"We have entered into an agreement with the State of Kansas to host Chiefs football beginning with the 2031 NFL season,\" Chiefs chairman and CEO Clark Hunt said in a statement. \"In the years ahead, we look forward to designing and building a state-of-the-art domed stadium and mixed-use district in Wyandotte County, and a best-in-class training facility, team headquarters, and mixed-use district in Olathe, totaling a minimum of $4 billion of development in the State of Kansas.\"Clark said that the move and building of the new stadium will be a \"benefit to the entire region.\" \"A stadium of this caliber will put Kansas City in the running for Super Bowls, Final Fours, and other world-class events,\" he said. \"A brand new training facility and headquarters will allow the Chiefs to continue to attract top talent. And the vision for a new mixed-use district will rival that of any sports-anchored development anywhere in the country.\"\nFounded in 1960, the franchise moved from Dallas to Kansas City ahead of the 1963 season. Three years later, the Chiefs played in the first Super Bowl and three years after that won the final Super Bowl prior to the AFL-NFL merger. In 2019, the franchise broke its 50-year drought without a championship after defeating the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl LIV. Since then, the Chiefs have won two more Super Bowls while appearing in two others. Last season, the Chiefs joined the Miami Dolphins, Buffalo Bills and New England Patriots as the only franchises to appear in three consecutive Super Bowls. \"Of course, it will be difficult to bid farewell to Arrowhead Stadium in a few years,\" Hunt said. \"Like so many of you, Arrowhead reminds me of family memories and unforgettable moments. But the truth is, what makes Chiefs gamedays so special is you. Seats don't make noise, concrete doesn't intimidate opponents, parking lots don't cook barbecue. You do. \n\"From the day the Chiefs came to Kansas City, you have energized this team, and this team has elevated the profile of the city and the region. It's the reason kids from coast to coast wear red and gold t-shirts, and sports fans around the world will watch soccer games from our backyard this summer. This next step will further elevate the entire region in the eyes of the country and the world.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        A surprisingly poor season has the Baltimore Ravens on the verge of missing the playoffs for the first time since 2021, and with those postseason hopes dwindling after the Week 16 loss to the New England Patriots, team leadership fell further under the microscope. John Harbaugh has been a model of consistency throughout his 18-year tenure in Baltimore but suddenly faces real questions about his job security.When asked whether he is concerned about his grip on the job, though, Harbaugh brushed off the threat of a firing.\"Coaching at any level is a day-to-day job,\" Harbaugh said on the heels of his eighth loss this season. \"Your job is to do the best job you can today and to do everything you can to help your players -- and your coaches if you're a head coach -- be the best they can be every single day. It's never been about keeping a job. There's no such thing as 'your' job or 'my' job. We have responsibilities. We're given opportunities to steward those responsibilities, and you're given a job to do that until you're not.\"The Ravens' only road to the postseason is to win the AFC North, but to do so would require them to win out and the Pittsburgh Steelers to lose out. Anything short of those results would force Lamar Jackson, Derrick Henry and the rest of the star-laden roster to watch the playoffs from home. That is a precarious situation that few would have expected the preseason Super Bowl contenders to find themselves in for the final two weeks of the campaign.\nA losing record also remains on the table for the 7-8 Ravens, who have finished under .500 just twice in Harbaugh's prolific run.\"I try to do the job, not try to keep the job,\" said the 63-year-old Harbaugh. \"There's no such thing as 'having' a job. It's just 'doing' a job. So my focus is on, and it has been for the last 18 years here and last 41 years in coaching, to try to do the best job I can today and fight as hard as I can so the guys have the best chance to be successful today.\"Anything after today, I'm not thinking about because it's not given for us to think about. We don't have control over that except for the job we do today. If we do a good enough job today, then the opportunity to do that job or do a different job will be there tomorrow. That's what you hope for.\"\nHarbaugh regularly has Baltimore in the mix with the best teams in the league but has not broken through for a Super Bowl victory in 13 years. To boast a two-time MVP in Lamar Jackson and a typically elite defense but to be in the midst of a championship drought only emphasizes the sting of this particularly underwhelming season.Who would replace John Harbaugh?Harbaugh set a high bar over 18 years as the winningest coach in Ravens history and the third-winningest coach in the NFL since his arrival. Finding a successor who can uphold that standard is no guarantee. But the Ravens would be an attractive destination for potential candidates if they were to make a move.Buffalo Bills offensive coordinator Joe Brady has long been regarded as a premier assistant coach, at both the college and NFL levels, and will likely hear his name swirl as a target for head coaching opportunities this offseason. He has experience with an MVP-caliber quarterback in Josh Allen and could make excellent use of Jackson and his supporting cast.\nIf the Ravens were inclined to stay within the Harbaugh tree, they could look toward Los Angeles Chargers defensive coordinator Jesse Minter. The former Baltimore defensive backs coach has experience working under both John Harbaugh and Jim Harbaugh, won a national championship at Michigan and built back-to-back top-10 defenses upon his return to the NFL.Former head coaches including Robert Saleh and Brian Flores could also emerge as priority candidates. Other star coordinators such as Klink Kubiak and Chris Shula could be in line for opportunities, too.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        DK Metcalf has been suspended two games without pay by the NFL stemming from his altercation with a fan during the Pittsburgh Steelers' Week 16 win over the Detroit Lions, per CBS Sports lead NFL insider Jonathan Jones. Metcalf reportedly plans to appeal the suspension. Pittsburgh's veteran receiver is slated to miss the Steelers' Week 17 road game against the Cleveland Browns and their Week 18 home game with the Baltimore Ravens. Pittsburgh (9-6) can clinch the AFC North division title with either a win over the Browns or a Ravens loss at Green Bay on Saturday night. Metcalf, who signed a four-year, $132 million deal with Pittsburgh this past offseason, is slated to lose $555,556 in salary over the next two weeks. The NFL determined that Metcalf's actions violated league policy, which specifies that \"players may not enter the stands or otherwise confront fans at any time on game day and ... if a player makes unnecessary physical contact with a fan in any way that constitutes unsportsmanlike conduct or presents crowd-control issues and/or risk of injury, he will be held accountable.\"\nMetcalf appeared to throw a punch at a Lions fan during the first half of Pittsburgh's eventual 29-24 win. Metcalf reportedly had prior history with the fan when he was a member of the Seattle Seahawks. \nBecause this interaction took place off the field and was not seen by officials, it could not be penalized or result in an ejection, according to CBS rules analyst Gene Steratore. \"Because the officials did not see this -- and (you) wouldn't expect them to from where DK Metcalf was, it's not something they can weigh in on from an officiating standpoint. I have been notified, though, that will be delivered to compliance with the NFL, and they'll address it at that point,\" Steratore said. \nThe fan, who identified himself as Ryan Kennedy, told The Detroit Free Press that the altercation stemmed from him calling Metcalf by his full name. A source close to Metcalf, however, told NFL Media that Kennedy called Metcalf's mom a derogatory word and also called Metcalf \"something we both know you don't call a Black man.\"Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said afterward that he had yet to address the situation with Metcalf, who didn't speak to reporters after the game. Metcalf, who played the entire game, caught four passes for 42 yards and delivered a key block on Jaylen Warren's second 45-yard touchdown run that proved to be the game-winning score. How does this impact the Steelers?\nMetcalf's suspension won't matter if the Packers defeat the Ravens on Saturday night. If that happens, it would make Pittsburgh's final two regular-season games meaningless from a playoff standpoint.\nIf the Ravens beat the Packers, however, Metcalf's absence could become a significant factor for a Steelers team that would then need to win one of their remaining two games in order to capture the North and the playoff berth that comes with it. In addition to being the Steelers' leading receiver (in terms of receiving yards), Metcalf is also a physical presence in the running game, as evidenced on Warren's game-winning touchdown run against the Lions. Metcalf's physicality was one of the things that compelled the Steelers to acquire him this offseason. \nIf the Steelers need to win one of their remaining two games, Metcalf's absence will undoubtedly put more pressure on Pittsburgh's other skill players. Fortunately for the Steelers, they've received a recent uptick in production from their pass-catchers after acquiring veteran Adam Thielen and signing Marquez Valdes-Scantling off the practice squad. \nThe Steelers have also continued to receive sizable contributions in the passing game from Warren and fellow running back Kenneth Gainwell. The duo has combined to catch 95 passes for 710 yards and five touchdowns that include Gainwell's unbelievable 45-yard touchdown catch during Sunday's win over the Lions. Gainwell is actually the Steelers' leading pass-catcher with 62 catches through 15 games. Pittsburgh is also coming off of its best rushing performance of the season, which included 230 yards on 27 carries. Warren, who had two touchdown runs of 45 yards, is averaging 4.5 yards per carry and is 172 yards away from his first 1,000-yard rushing season. Gainwell has complemented Warren with 501 yards on the ground and a team-high 4.9 yards per carry. Metcalf's suspension will only impact the Steelers if the Ravens win on Saturday night. But even if that happens, it appears Pittsburgh has several players capable of stepping into the void.  \n            ",

Kyle Tucker, Alex Bregman, Bo Bichette, Framber Valdez, Cody Bellinger and Ranger Suárez are among the players still on the free agent market, which has been slow to develop. Kyle Schwarber (who returned to the Phillies), Pete Alonso and Edwin Dìaz (who both left the Mets for the Orioles and Dodgers, respectively) all signed during the Winter Meetings earlier in December.Earlier this winter, right-hander Dylan Cease agreed to a seven-year, $210 million deal with the Blue Jays on Thanksgiving Eve. It's tied for the fourth-largest deal in terms of total money among active pitchers, and is a big boost for the reigning AL champs. While there's no Aaron Judge or Juan Soto on the market this winter, there's plenty of top talent still available. Tucker, a four-time All-Star who will turn 29 in January, leads the list, and though his second half left much to be desired, he could be a huge asset for any team. Bregman was left on the market until late last winter but he showed no ill effects, putting up a 128 OPS+. On the pitching side, Valdez and Suárez would slot in toward the front of any rotation.\n\n        \n            \n                Ranking top 50 MLB free agents for 2026: Kyle Tucker, Alex Bregman at top, plus landing spots for every player\n                \n                    R.J.

TCU found itself in the Top 25 once -- back in September -- before having a pedestrian run through the Big 12 schedule, finishing 5-4. Even with the Horned Frogs playing in the easier conference than the Trojans, USC both averaged more points and allowed fewer points per game. USC sports a 32-9 (78%) straight-up record when favored since Lincoln Riley came aboard in 2022, as it is projected to easily take care of business in San Antonio. SportsLine's model has the Trojans prevailing 70% of the time. See all of the model's college football bowl confidence picks here.Another one of the bowl confidence predictions the model is high on: Northwestern (-10.5) handles Central Michigan in the GameAbove Sports Bowl on Dec. 26. Central Michigan struggled mightily against Power 4 opponents this year, losing 63-3 to Michigan and 45-17 to Pittsburgh. Northwestern went just 6-6 this year, but that was largely thanks to a very tough Big Ten schedule that included Oregon, Michigan, USC and Illinois. For comparison, Northwestern lost to Michigan by two points on a last-second field goal. The model has Northwestern winning nearly 80% of the time, making the Wildcats the clear side to back. See the rest of the college football bowl confidence predictions here. How to make college football bowl confidence picksThe model has also made the call on who wins every other bowl game.

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Bad luck would be better than the injury luck the Kansas City Chiefs have experienced this season. That trend continued during their Week 16 loss to the Tennessee Titans as quarterback Gardner Minshew -- who started the game in placed of injured starter Patrick Mahomes -- sustained a knee injury that led to him missing the majority of the game. While it was initially feared that he had suffered a torn ACL, Minshew's ACL is reportedly still intact. However, Minshew is still expected to miss the rest of the season, which led to the Chiefs signing fellow quarterback Shane Buechele off the Buffalo Bills' practice squad for the season's final two weeks. A former undrafted rookie, Buechele won a Super Bowl in 2023 while serving as Mahomes' backup. Minshew was replaced on Sunday by backup Chris Oladokun, who went 11 of 16 for 111 yards and was sacked four times after Minshew went to the locker room. The Titans took a 9-6 lead into intermission before pulling away for a 26-9 win. The Pittsburgh Steelers selected Oladokun, 28, in the seventh round of the 2022 NFL Draft. Oladokun signed three years ago after he hit waivers. His only previous regular season experience took place in Week 18 of the 2024 season. He had never thrown a pass in a regular season game prior to Sunday. \nMinshew, 29, is in his first season with the Chiefs, his fourth team over the past five seasons. He earned a Pro Bowl nod in 2023 after throwing for a career-high 3,305 yards in 13 starts with the Indianapolis Colts. \nMahomes sustained a season-ending knee injuring during the loss to the Los Angeles Chargers on Dec. 14 that knocked Kansas City out of postseason contention. This season marks the first time since 2014 that the Chiefs will not be in the playoffs. \nThe Chiefs fell to 6-9 with Sunday's loss and will round out the season with a home game against the Denver Broncos on Christmas and a road game against the Las Vegas Raiders. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Kansas City Chiefs host the Washington Commanders on Monday Night Football to conclude the Week 8 NFL schedule. The Commanders will be without quarterback Jayden Daniels, who suffered a knee injury last week against the Cowboys and won't play on Monday. That has caused significant movement in the Monday Night Football betting lines, with Kansas City favored by 11.5 points following Daniels' injury. Although Daniels is out, the Commanders will have a lift at receiver with Terry McLaurin (quad) and Deebo Samuel (heel) both set to return to play. Kickoff from GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, is set for 8:15 p.m. ET. There are dozens of betting options if you're wondering how to bet on the NFL, or more specifically, Commanders vs. Chiefs. Here's a closer look at available sportsbook promos on some of the top NFL betting sites, as well as the best betting apps that are available for Chiefs vs. Commanders on Monday Night Football, with instructions on how to claim each offer and where to bet NFL.Where to bet on Chiefs vs. Commanders on Monday Night FootballBrandPromoCBS promo codeDraftKingsBet $5, get $300 in bonus bets and 3 months of NBA League Pass free if your first bet winsJust click hereBetMGMUp to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet losesCBSSPORTSbet365Bet $5, get $200 in bonus bets win or loseCBSBET365CaesarsBet $1, double your winnings your next 20 betsCBSDYWFanDuelBet $5, get $300 in bonus bets if your bet winsJust click hereFanaticsBet and get up to $2,000 in No Sweat Bets FanCash Just click hereThe DraftKings promo code, bet365 bonus code and FanDuel promo code all offer bonus bets after new users place a wager of $5 or more.

FanDuel offers new users $300 in bonus bets if their first bet of at least $5 wins. DraftKings also offers $300 in bonus bets with a winning wager of at least $5, but with the latest DraftKings promo code with the 2025-26 NBA season beginning, new users also receive three months of NBA League Pass free, on top of the $300 in bonus bets.The latest Fanatics Sportsbook promo code provides new users who place a cash wager of at least $1 on any market with odds of -500 or longer up to $200 in FanCash per day every day for ten (10) consecutive days, if the initial wager settles as a loss.

Terry McLaurin takes the field for the first time since Week 3, and that provides a significant offensive lift with the 30-year-old coming off his fifth straight season with at least 1,000 receiving yards while also having a career-high 13 touchdowns. Mariota can make enough plays for Washington to keep pace with Kansas City, as the model projects the Commanders to cover in 55% of simulations.Over 48 pointsPatrick Mahomes has his full complement of playmakers for just the second time this season, and he led Kansas City to 31 points against the Raiders last week with Rashee Rice, Xavier Worthy and Travis Kelce all active. Rice had seven receptions for 42 yards and two touchdowns in his return from suspension and despite all the new and younger playmakers, the reliable Kelce still led Kansas City with 54 receiving yards. Mahomes is once again playing elite football, entering Week 8 with 1,800 passing yards, which is fourth in the NFL, as Kansas City is sixth in the NFL in scoring offense, averaging 26.6 ppg. Having McLaurin and Deebo Samuel back for Washington will be crucial for Mariota, and the model expects the veteran backup to lead enough scoring drives for this game to hit the Over. The model projects the Over to hit in 52% of simulations.Responsible gamingResponsible gaming is a serious topic, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users play responsibly. The top sportsbooks feature several tools and resources available on their apps and websites, including wager limits, voluntary self-exclusion options, and more.

Oliver suffered a torn biceps muscle and will be sidelined indefinitely as a result, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter.Oliver will undergo an MRI in order to confirm the injury. The Bills defensive tackle suffered the injury late in the second quarter of their 40-9 win against the Carolina Panthers. Just before the two-minute warning of Sunday's game, Oliver fell to the turf during a three-yard run from Panthers running back Chuba Hubbard and began flexing his left arm. Oliver walked off the field with the training staff before heading into the medical tent. Eventually, Oliver made his way to the locker room before being ruled out for the remainder of the game due to the injury.\nIt's been a rough start to the 2025 season for Oliver, who had already missed four games due to an ankle injury. Oliver had returned to the field earlier this month against the Atlanta Falcons and has logged 12 combined tackles, three sacks, and a forced fumble in three games.Oliver registered three combined tackles to go along with a sack in the first half of Sunday's contest.\nWith Oliver set to be out for the foreseeable future, it's certainly not an ideal situation for Bills defensive line that had already been bitten by the injury bug. T.J. Sanders and DeWayne Carter are both currently on injured reserve, while DaQuan Jones has missed the past two games with a calf injury. The team did recently get veteran defensive tackle Larry Ogunjobi back from a six-game suspension for violating the NFL's performance-enhancing drugs policy.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The start of any season brings with it an abundance of overreactions, as well as intriguing performances and subpar efforts. The trick is navigating this while others in your league make some hasty decisions. Week 2 provides us with plenty of action, with 15 teams tabled for four appearances and 14 teams taking the court three times, leaving the Clippers as the only team with two games. Sitting players who only go three times has its advantages, but fantasy managers still have to make smart decisions when figuring out whom to play, regardless of game count. Being aware of back-to-back sets is also a key factor, especially with so many teams now sitting players during the home stretch.Four Games: ATL, BOS, CHA, CHI, CLE, GSW, LAL, MEM, NOP, OKC, ORL, PHI, PHO, TOR, UTAThree Games: BKN, DAL, DEN, DET, HOU, IND, MIA, MIL, MIN, NYK, POR, SAC, SAS, WASTwo Games: LACHere are four potential starts and four potential sits entering the second week of the NBA season. Just keep in mind that this is based on games played for the week. If you play in a rotisserie league, the number of games played each week may not matter in your format. \nGuardsConsider starting: Tre Jones, CHIOpponents: ATL, SAC, NYK, @NYKA preseason calf injury to Coby White immediately saw Jones shift into the starting lineup, a role we saw him fill down the stretch last season, before suffering an ankle injury. Through the first two games of the season, Jones has been a pest on the defensive end, tallying eight combined steals, adding 16 assists, and 25 points. White is slated to miss at least another week, meaning Jones should be able to hold down the starting role for all four upcoming games. He could be sitting on waivers in some leagues, and not only is he a no-brainer as a pickup, but he also makes sense as a starter with four games on the card.Consider sitting: Bradley Beal, LACOpponents: @GSW, NOPBeal, on the other hand, has been woeful to begin the season and has now popped up on the injury report with a back issue. Through his first two games, he has averaged 5.5 points in 20 minutes per game, despite starting both games. Having played in fewer than 55 games in each of the past three seasons, Beal's time as a viable fantasy asset may be coming to an end. He is worth holding onto, just in case he can figure things out, but with only two games this week, he certainly makes sense as a bench candidate.Consider sitting: D'Angelo Russell, DALOpponents: OKC, IND, @DETMuch like Beal, Russell was invisible to begin the season, averaging just 11.5 minutes per game through two games, playing off the bench. He was seen as a potential late-round flyer heading into the season, largely under the presumption that he would be the starting point guard. While Russell's first two games were a concern, he had a big performance against the Raptors on Sunday, posting 24 points, six assists, five rebounds, and three steals in 29 minutes. That should at least give fantasy managers some more confidence to hold, but he's still a risky start and may be better suited to keep on the bench.\nForwardsConsider starting: Sam Hauser, BOSOpponents: @NOP, CLE, @PHI, HOUSeen as a potential breakout season for Hauser, things have gotten off to a solid enough start. Hauser started the first two games of the season while coming off the bench for Sunday's game against the Pistons. However, coming off the bench didn't affect his minutes. Through three contests, the forward is averaging 11.3 points (3.3 3s) and three rebounds in 24.7 minutes. The Celtics have four games this upcoming week, making him a viable starting piece on most fantasy squads.Consider starting: Cedric Coward, MEMOpponents: @GSW, @PHO, LAL, @TORCoward has been a revelation to begin the season, providing the Grizzlies with hope despite another early-season injury crisis. While a lot of what he has done is likely unsustainable, there is certainly enough there to warrant attention in fantasy leagues. Through three games, he is averaging 19 points, 3.7 rebounds, 1.7 steals, and 2.7 3-pointers in 22.7 minutes per game, shooting 70.4 percent from the field and 91.7 percent from the line. Obviously, the shooting is going to regress, which impacts multiple categories. However, he has been very active on both ends of the floor, and it appears as though he has earned the trust of the coaching staff already. Despite being unproven, Coward is definitely someone to consider starting with four games coming up.Consider sitting: Tari Eason, HOUOpponents: BKN, @TOR, @BOSEason was a seemingly safe target in the seventh or eighth round of drafts this season, a range that looks too high at this early stage. The Rockets have lost two straight games to begin the season, with Eason basically a non-factor in both games. In 25 minutes per game, he has averaged just 3.5 points, five rebounds, and one combined steal and block. While there is almost no way he could get any worse, his on-court decision-making has raised some questions as to his long-term value in Houston. He should be held, at least for now, but sliding him to your bench could alleviate some frustrations this week.\nCentersConsider starting: Wendell Carter, ORLOpponents: @PHI, @DET, @CHA, @WASFollowing a strong preseason, Carter has started the season proper with some solid performances. Across three games, he is averaging nine points, 9.7 rebounds, and 1.7 steals in 30.5 minutes per game. While the numbers aren't going to blow anyone away, the fact that he is playing upwards of 30 minutes on a nightly basis is a step in the right direction. Goga Bitadze has done very little to convince the coaching staff that he should be playing more minutes, giving Carter some leeway when it comes to playing time. With four games coming up, Carter is a relatively safe option to start as your second or third center this week.Consider sitting: Dereck Lively, DALOpponents: OKC, IND, @DETEven with Daniel Gafford injured, Lively has been largely underwhelming to this point, averaging 5.3 points, five rebounds, three assists, and 1.3 blocks in 17 minutes. All signs point to him being the starting center, even when Gafford is cleared to return. However, we could be looking at something close to a minutes split, making both players tough to roster with any confidence. I would recommend holding Lively wherever possible, as he is coming off an injury himself. For this week, leaving him on your bench could provide him with an opportunity to ramp up, without limiting your overall fantasy squad.\n            ",

While Week 9 did not provide the kind of chaotic shakeup we saw from the week before, there are some shifting trends among the CBS Sports 136 that indicate where things are headed over the final month of the season. Ole Miss, for example, seems to be solidifying its position as one of the top teams in the country. The rise for the Rebels after beating Oklahoma in Norman was always going to be limited by a head-to-head loss to Georgia, but our voters felt strongly enough about the result against the Sooners to move Lane Kiffin's squad ahead of undefeated Georgia Tech. With just a few challenges left on the slate, Ole Miss appears to be barreling towards its first-ever CFP appearance, and our voters are in agreement with that standing placing them in the same conversation as Alabama, Oregon and Georgia as the top one-loss teams in the country. Elsewhere in the CBS Sports 136, we see some notable moves up for one-loss Big 12 teams Cincinnati (up four spots) and Houston (up seven spots), as each logged key wins in conference play over the weekend and continue to build their case as top-20 teams nationally with their 7-1 records. \n        \n            \n                Bowl projections: Vanderbilt enters CFP bracket as SEC's fifth team, BYU flexes as new Big 12 frontrunner\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nOf course, there are some rankings repercussions for LSU's blowout home loss to Texas A&M that exist outside of Brian Kelly's firing. The Tigers were in fact one of the most notable adjustments as they tumbled out of the top 30 following the defeat. For more on that change, and the other notable week-to-week adjustments in the CBS Sports 136, check out the Mover's Report below the top 25 table. College football experts from CBS Sports and 247Sports contribute ballots each week, which are averaged together for our rankings. You can see the top 25 below and 26-136 on our rankings page.\nRankTeamRecordPrevious1Ohio State7-012Indiana8-023Texas A&M8-034Alabama7-145Oregon7-156Georgia6-167Ole Miss7-188Georgia Tech8-079Miami6-1910Texas Tech6-11211Vanderbilt7-11112BYU8-01013Notre Dame5-21414Cincinnati7-11815Louisville6-11716Tennessee6-22017Oklahoma6-21518Missouri6-21319Utah6-22220Virginia7-11621Houston7-12822USC5-22523Michigan6-22624Texas6-22325Memphis7-140Biggest movers No. 25 Memphis (+15): The Tigers fell 17 spots last week after losing to UAB, and now they've gained almost all of that rankings equity back with a thrilling home win against South Florida. Our voters had the Bulls up at No. 19 last week and dropped them to No. 28 after the loss, providing a sensible landing spot for a one-loss Memphis team that now has a huge win in the American title race. No. 48 Auburn (+11): Some good news for Auburn! After an 0-4 start to SEC play, Hugh Freeze made a change at quarterback and Ashton Daniels helped propel the Tigers to a win at Arkansas. A win against Baylor provides a connective data point for voters sorting out teams in the Nos. 40-60 range of the CBS Sports 136 but does the narrow margins of defeat against four quality opponents during the 4-4 start to the season. No. 51 Kansas State (+10): For a team that did not have an FBS win until Sept. 27, Kansas State has things going, relatively, in a pretty good direction. The Wildcats have won three of four, recently stringing together a pair of double-digit wins against TCU and Kansas. The remaining schedule is daunting and leaves little room for error because of that 1-3 start to the season, but keep your eye on this team as one that could play spoiler in the Big 12 coming down the stretch.  No. 52 Wake Forest (+10): The Demon Deacons have five games left on the schedule and need just one to be bowl eligible. They have already hit the over on their preseason win total according to the oddsmakers (4.5 wins), and with Delaware and North Carolina on the schedule, there's at least two chances where Wake Forest will likely be favored to win. Jake Dickert's work in Year 1 is worth celebrating at year's end. But, for now, our voters are just going to reward the victory against SMU, which was the Mustangs' first-ever regular season loss in ACC play. No. 58 Baylor (-10): The Bears defense has given up 35+ points in five of the seven FBS games it's played this season, and on Saturday the inability to stop the ground game doomed them in a 41-20 loss at Cincinnati. There are winnable games left that have a bowl game still on the table for Baylor, now at 4-4, but the weaknesses have been consistent, and our voters are going to struggle giving tiebreaker edges to teams with obvious flaws. No. 32 LSU (-11): That's 19 combined spots lost over the last two weeks for LSU, who, on the surface, did not take bad losses (Vanderbilt, Texas A&M) but certainly did not show the kind of form that had the school believing this season was going to end well. By moving on from Brian Kelly, LSU has punted on playoff contention for 2025, and our voters have similarly removed them from consideration for top spots on the ballot. It's a talented 5-3 team but not one with a resume worth ranking inside the top 30.No. 39 Arizona State (-12): The Sun Devils have been bouncing up and down the rankings in recent weeks. There was a slide down after a 32-point loss to Utah, then a quick rebound after handing Texas Tech its first loss of the season. Now, voters are readjusting again after a 24-16 home loss to Houston, which, for the record, did move up to No. 21. Injuries have played a role in Arizona State's struggles, for sure, but the competition for spots in the 30s is too close to make excuses for every team. No. 45 SMU (-13): Two straight road games finally caught up with SMU, and the Mustangs were unable to take advantage of a few breaks in a 13-12 loss at Wake Forest. There will be chances for SMU to carve a path into the ACC title picture again with home games against Miami and Louisville in the coming weeks, but for now in the national picture there had to be an adjustment after Saturday's loss to the Demon Deacons.  Check out the rest of the CBS Sports 136: Teams ranked 26-136\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Two years ago, Texas A&M paid Jimbo Fisher more than $70 million to go away, the biggest buyout in the history of college football. On Sunday, Brian Kelly reportedly picked up the second-largest buyout ever.Those situations had one person in common: Scott Woodward. The LSU athletic director has a reputation of fishing for splashy hires. During his first stop at Washington, he lured Chris Petersen from Boise State. At Texas A&M, he landed the hire of the century by bringing national champion Fisher to College Station. And after taking the LSU job in 2019, he swung for the fences when he lured Brian Kelly from Notre Dame with a massive 10-year contract. Woodward is a poster child for winning the press conference, imposing his will and handing out some of the craziest contracts ever. But now, for the second time in three years, his obsession with swinging for the fences has a major athletic department reeling. And now, with the board and even governor of Louisiana getting involved, LSU should seriously consider whether Woodward deserves the chance to make a third mistaken hire. Let's turn the clock back to the 2021 coaching carousel for a moment. From the start, it was clear that Woodward -- a native son of Baton Rouge -- was saving his biggest moment for his alma mater. LSU was tied to then-Oklahoma coach Lincoln Riley, to the point that Riley even publicly said he would not go to Baton Rouge. He instead took the USC job. \nThen, it was trying to convince Fisher to go from Texas A&M to LSU. His interest earned Fisher a new monstrous extension -- so technically, not all $70 million in buyout money was Woodward's fault. From there, it was haphazardly big game hunting. Lane Kiffin. Mel Tucker. There was little consideration for taking shots like Georgia defensive coordinator Dan Lanning or Texas A&M defensive coordinator Mike Elko. Hindsight is 20/20 on those candidates, but they're leading some of the best teams in college football in 2025. Finally, in Kelly, Woodward convinced a \"name\" to say yes. The Notre Dame coach was a career northern coach without any history recruiting the south. He was a ball coach and program builder with struggles recruiting at the highest level. In his mind, introducing the recruiting infrastructure would solve his greatest problems; there wasn't much consideration that he was a part of the issue. \nFrom the start, Kelly in the Deep South was a little bit of a joke. He became a meme when he tried to feign a Southern accent, and danced with a recruit. It was a strange look for the longtime coach at Notre Dame, one of the most straight laced programs in the sport. Kelly did have some quick success, leading the Tigers to a 2022 SEC West title and win over Alabama. But from there, cracks started forming in the foundation. In the past two years, the defense declined. When they invested heavily to fix it, the offensive line and running game collapsed. To the contrary, Marcus Freeman, the coach that replaced Kelly at Notre Dame, played for a national championship in 2025. No one in South Bend sweated losing the winningest coach in the history of the program. \nLSU under Kelly never reached serious national championship contention, despite putting elite resources into the 2025 recruiting class. The swing for the fences resulted in another strikeout, and a wildly expensive one at that. Even heading into Sunday, it was viewed as unlikely around the industry that Kelly's job was seriously on the line. Instead, Woodward pulled the plug after a disappointing 49-25 loss to No. 3 Texas A&M at Tiger Stadium that ended with \"Fire Kelly!\" chants across the venue. To be clear, there is value to taking swings and winning the press conference. It can galvanize fans and boosters, bringing much needed support -- financial and otherwise -- to the athletic department. \nBy hiring Petersen, Woodward resurrected Washington's athletic department, turning them into a national contender. Fisher also led Texas A&M to an Orange Bowl victory and AP top-five finish before he was unceremoniously canned. And even though the on-field product ultimately suffered, it galvanized Texas A&M into investing at the top of college football. But entering a competitive coaching market and new era of college football, LSU has to be smarter about managing its search. There are power players in Louisiana who would view the coach at Tulane, Jon Sumrall, as beneath them. They should not. Sumrall is one of the best coaches in America. Not giving him a full vetting would be malpractice. And furthermore, the magnetic power of individual coaches in the sport is waning. More important now is resource, infrastructure and administrative support. Indiana's hiring of Curt Cignetti spurred action, but their ascension to the top of the sport coincides with unprecedented investment in the program. To the contrary, LSU only re-entered the elite tier of player acquisition with the 2024-25 recruiting class. Will the next coach be given top 1% investment? That matters far more than whether you hand him a $12 million contract. \nIt's unclear at this point whether Woodward will lead the coaching search in 2025. Louisiana governor Jeff Landry has already made his voice heard. LSU does not have a permanent school president, only complicating the situation. And certainly, Woodward will feel personal pressure to clean up his mistake and deliver an even bigger result for his hometown program. But if LSU has not learned from Woodward's repeated mistakes, nothing will change. Don't worry about winning the press conference. Just hire a dang good coach. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Despite coming off a 23-21 victory over Mississippi State on Saturday, Oct. 18, the win wasn't enough for Billy Napier to keep his post as head coach of the Florida Gators. Napier was fired on Sunday, Oct. 19, in the midst of a 3-4 season with the Gators and an overall mark of 22-23 throughout his four years in Gainesville, Fla. His .489 winning percentage is the fourth-worst in Florida Gators football history, and it's the worst winning percentage of any Florida football coach since 1950. Receivers coach Billy Gonzales was named interim by athletic director, Scott Stricklin, for the Gators' remaining five games following the Week 9 bye.With a storied tradition, an abundance of resources and in a state brimming with elite prospects, the Florida football coaching search will have no shortage of top candidates, though a crazy coaching carousel that also has seen Penn State and LSU make moves could complicate the search.

He's hailed for his quick turnarounds as the Wildcats were winless in 2020 before Fisch's arrival, won just one game in his first year with Arizona but went 10-3 in 2023, winning a bowl game and finishing 11th in the final AP Poll.\n\"Fisch has significant experience as an offensive coordinator and position coach at both the college and NFL level, and has quickly developed a reputation as someone who can turn a program around during his head coaching stints with Arizona and Washington,\" said Goodall. \"He ended his tenure with the Wildcats with a 10-3 record in 2023, and has Washington 5-2 this season after going 6-7 in 2024.\" See more candidates at Swamp247.How to get insider Florida coaching search updates The rest of the list includes several other exciting possibilities, including a coach coming off a CFP appearance who consistently nails his recruiting classes. You can only see who it is by joining Swamp247.Who are the top names in the Florida football coaching search, and which proven recruiter coming off a CFP berth could the Gators express interest in?

    "body": "\n        The New York Jets rallied with a 23-point fourth quarter on Sunday to defeat the Cincinnati Bengals for their first win of the season, snapping a dreadful seven-game losing streak. It was a cathartic experience for quarterback Justin Fields, who played some of his best football of the year in the 39-38 triumph.The win capped off an emotional week for Fields. He shed light on the trials he faced in recent days following a brief benching and pointed comments from Jets owner Woody Johnson, who openly criticized his quarterback amid the extended losing spell.\"I've been praying like crazy just for a win,\" Fields said after the win. \"I'm going to get pretty vulnerable right here. This week, I found myself in my closet crying on the ground, laying down. Not because of the hardships, not because of the troubles. I felt like I was built to handle that and I was put in a place to handle this situation. But in that moment when I was talking to my best friend how hard it was and just not wavering faith-wise.\"Jets coach Aaron Glenn pulled Fields out of the lineup during the Week 7 loss to the Carolina Panthers and replaced him with backup Tyrod Taylor. Both quarterbacks struggled mightily in the defeat, and Glenn was coy on who would handle the starting reps against the Bengals until a knee injury held Taylor out and sent Fields back into the lineup.\nFields' reinsertion into the offense came after the team owner took a jab at the quarterback play. Johnson publicly pointed out Fields' middling efficiency ratings and placed much of the blame on the Jets' poor start on the quarterback while shielding Glenn from criticism.\"It's been a lot for me emotionally, spiritually,\" Fields said. \"When I was on the field, I was damn near about to start crying. Not because we won, but just because of the greatness of God and just how everything works for the greater good, everything I've been through this past week, everything that we've been through as a team these past seven weeks. It was a lot of ups and downs. I got a lot of support from my teammates, from my brothers, from my family, from my friends. Most of all, I'm just thankful.\"\nFields fought through the adversity to post one of his best performances of the season. He completed 21 of 32 passes for 244 yards and a touchdown in the win over the Bengals and handled 11 carries for an additional 31 yards. The Jets trailed by double digits on three separate occasions, but Fields and running back Breece Hall strung together scoring drive after scoring drive in the final quarter to erase their deficits and jump ahead in the final minutes.\n            ",

    "description": "\n        If you like blowouts, Week 8 was the week for you. Of the 12 games that happened between Thursday and Sunday, 11 were decided by double digit",
    "body": "\n        If you like blowouts, Week 8 was the week for you. Of the 12 games that happened between Thursday and Sunday, 11 were decided by double digits. The lone one-score game was the New York Jets' comeback over the Cincinnati Bengals, which gave them their first win of the season. Moreover, eight games were decided by 18 or more points, which is the most in a week in 11 years. If blowouts aren't your thing and you're more interested in road favorites, well, Week 9 has just what the doctor ordered. In all, nine teams have opened as road favorites for the upcoming slate, which includes the Kansas City Chiefs as they gear up for their heavyweight showdown with the Buffalo Bills at Highmark Stadium. On top of K.C., Baltimore, Chicago, Indy, and Denver are other notable teams heading into enemy territory this weekend as favorites. But how much are they favored by? Who are the home teams actually favored to win their games? Let's take an early look at the Week 9 lines. Note: Cleveland, New York (Jets), Philadelphia, and Tampa Bay are on the bye in Week 9\nWeek 9 early odds(All lines via FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 bet; all games on Sunday unless noted)GameEarly lineEarly totalEarly moneylineRavens at Dolphins (Thursday)Ravens -7.549.5Ravens -370, Dolphins +295Falcons at PatriotsPatriots -5.545.5Falcons +205, Patriots -250Panthers at PackersPackers -12.543.5Panthers +530, Packers -752Bears at BengalsBears -2.551.5Bears -126, Bengals +108Colts at SteelersColts -349.5Colts -162, Steelers +136Chargers at TitansChargers -10.542.5Chargers -592, Titans +43049ers at Giants49ers -2.546.549ers -156, Giants +132Broncos at TexansBroncos -1.539.5Broncos -116, Texans -102Vikings at LionsLions -9.547.5Vikings +380, Lions -481Jaguars at RaidersJaguars -343.5Jaguars -174, Raiders +146Saints at RamsRams -13.544.5Saints +640, Rams -952Chiefs at Bills Chiefs -1.551.5Chiefs -126, Bills +108Seahawks at CommandersSeahawks -345.5Seahawks -166, Commanders +138Cardinals at Cowboys (Monday)Cowboys -353.5Cardinals +130, Cowboys -154Notable movement, trendsRavens at Dolphins (Thursday)\nAll eyes will be on Lamar Jackson this week. Despite initially being listed as a \"full participant\" last week, Jackson really just worked scout team and did not play against Chicago. However, the line opening at Baltimore -8.5 and moving down slightly to Baltimore -7.5 still suggests that the oddsmakers believe Jackson will be under center on Thursday night. He'll look to face a Dolphins team that is fresh off a blowout win over the Falcons, but still has a load of questions. Miami has covered its lone game this season as a home underdog and is 2-1 ATS at Hard Rock Stadium overall. As for Baltimore, the club is 0-2 ATS this season as a road favorite. Falcons at Patriots\nNew England is gaining the respect of the oddsmakers as an elite team in the AFC. After the line opened at Patriots -3.5, the club now finds itself laying 5.5 points to the Falcons. While part of that is due to the emergence of Drake Maye as an MVP candidate, it also certainly has to do with the uncertain status of Michael Penix Jr. and Drake London after the QB-WR duo missed Week 8 due to injury. Atlanta is 1-2 ATS on the road this season, while the Patriots are 2-2 ATS in Foxborough. Panthers at Packers\nGreen Bay opened as an 11.5-point favorite, and that has only grown with them spotting Carolina 12.5 points. It remains to be seen who'll be under center for the Panthers in Week 9, with Bryce Young dealing with an injury that made him inactive in Week 8. If he's again placed on the shelf, that'll likely slot Andy Dalton back into the starting spot. The Packers are 2-1 ATS at home this season, while Carolina is 2-2 ATS on the road. Bears at Bengals\nChicago opened as a 2.5-point road favorite, and despite falling to the Ravens and Caleb Williams looking shaky in the process of that defeat, the line has held. That's thanks to Cincinnati not looking like a world beater by any stretch, particularly after allowing the previously winless Jets to roll off 23 fourth-quarter points to pull off the upset. The Bears are 2-2 ATS on the road this season, and this will be the first time they are laying points on the road. As for the Bengals, they are 2-2 ATS at home in 2025, which includes a 1-1 ATS record as a home underdog.   Colts at Steelers\nIndy opened as a 2.5-point road favorite, and that spread has since crossed a key number, are the Colts are now laying the full field goal. Daniel Jones and Co. continue to look like a juggernaut offensively, and should be chomping at the bit to square off against a soft Pittsburgh defense that just lost as a home underdog in Week 8 and also failed to cover. The Colts are 2-1 ATS on the road this season, and that includes an ATS win as a road favorite. Chargers at Titans\nThe Chargers are now laying 10.5 points to the Titans on the road, which is up from the 8.5 points they were spotting at the open. After playing on Thursday, Los Angeles will have the rest advantage, which is just another hurdle for a Tennessee team that is tied for an NFL low 2-6 ATS record on the season. The Titans have also yet to earn an ATS win at Nissan Stadium (0-3 ATS). This will be an opportunity for the Chargers to improve their 1-2 ATS record as a road favorite this season. \n        \n            \n                Ranking the craziest comebacks in 2025 as Jets break NFL record just eight weeks into season\n                \n                    Douglas Clawson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n49ers at Giants\nSan Francisco opened as a field goal favorite over New York, but that has since fallen below the key number and is now laying 2.5 points. The Niners laid an egg last week in a road loss to Houston, but are still 3-2 ATS on the road in 2025. It also remains to be seen if they'll get Brock Purdy back in the fold for this game, as he's been sidelined for an extended period of time due to a toe injury. Further clarity on his status could swing the line. Looking at the Giants, they were dealt another tough blow on the injury front with rookie running back Cam Skattebo suffering a season-ending ankle injury on Sunday. They'll need to persevere through that to keep themselves above .500 at home (2-1 ATS)Broncos at Texans\nDenver is laying 1.5 points on the road. On the one hand, it shouldn't come as too much of a surprise, as they are one of the hottest teams in the NFL (five-game winning streak) and just topped 40 points against Dallas. On the other hand, the Texans looked sharp against San Francisco last week, particularly C.J. Stroud, who completed 30 of his 39 passes. Houston is 2-1 ATS at home in 2025, while Denver is 1-1-1 ATS on the road. The lone situation the Broncos were a road favorite this season, they failed to cover. Vikings at Lions\nThe Lions were on the bye in Week 8 and emerged well-rested, along with being a 9.5-point favorite over Minnesota. Detroit is among the best teams to back in the NFL when they are at home, and are a perfect 3-0 ATS at Ford Field this season. The Lions 5-2 ATS record for the season is also tied for the second-best in the NFL. As for the Vikings, they are 1-1 ATS on the road, and it remains to be seen who'll start at quarterback for them between Carson Wentz and J.J. McCarthy.  Jaguars at Raiders\nBoth Jacksonville and Las Vegas were on the bye in Week 8, so it's an even rest advantage for these AFC clubs. The Jaguars opened as a field goal favorite, and that has remained the case coming into the week. This season, Liam Coen's team is just 1-1 ATS on the road, but is squaring off against a Raiders team that has struggled mightily in 2025. So far, Las Vegas is 2-5 ATS overall with an average margin of victory at -11, and is 1-2 ATS at home. Saints at Rams\nThe Saints are in a rough spot. The club is coming off a blowout loss to the Bucs at home, and now has to travel to Los Angeles to face a Rams team that is coming off its bye week. The oddsmakers certainly see this as another possible blowout with the Rams laying 13.5 points in the contest. New Orleans is tied for a league-worst 2-6 ATS record on the season, while L.A. is 5-2 ATS (2-1 ATS at home).  Chiefs at Bills\nThe heavyweight showdown of Week 9 takes us to Buffalo, where the Bills take on the Kansas City Chiefs. When they do kick off what could be an AFC Championship preview, the Bills are currently poised to do so as a home underdog with the Chiefs laying 1.5 points. Of course, with Kansas City yet to play its Week 8 matchup on Monday night, the line could still move, but the opening number has them favored. Buffalo is 1-3 ATS at home this season, but that lone cover did come as a home underdog. Seahawks at Commanders\nSeattle was on the bye in Week 8 and will have a considerable rest advantage over the Commanders, who will be playing on a short week after squaring off against the Chiefs on Monday night. That has the Seahawks laying a field goal on the road. Jayden Daniels' status will be worth monitoring this week as he has been sidelined due to injury. If he gets the green light to return, it's not out of the question that Washington finds itself favored by kickoff. That said, Seattle is a force in the NFC and owns a 5-2 ATS record, which includes a 3-0 ATS record on the road. Cardinals at Cowboys (Monday)\nThe Cowboys opened as a 3.5-point favorite over Arizona but have since lost the hook and are spotting them just a field goal. Dallas' defense has been a real problem for them throughout this season, and has contributed to them holding a mere 4-4 ATS record. The Cowboys are 2-1 ATS at home, but will face a rested Cardinals team that was on the bye in Week 8. Arizona is 3-0 ATS on the road in 2025. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        If it feels like an NFL team has pulled off a magical comeback with a nonsense sequence you've never seen before every week, well it has!The Jets added to the shenanigans on Sunday by beating the Bengals 39-38 after trailing by 15 points entering the fourth quarter. Yes, the same team whose owner said its quarterback couldn't complete a pass. The same team that had not won a game all year. That's pretty much par for the course this season.It's already the fourth win by a team down 15+ points entering the fourth quarter this year, the most in a season in NFL history. Not bad considering there's still 10 weeks to play!With that in mind, I ranked the eight craziest comebacks this season through eight weeks.\n8. Week 5: Broncos roll the dice, stun EaglesThe Broncos' fourth-quarter magic began in Week 5 when they shocked the defending Super Bowl champions, outscoring the Eagles 18-0 in the fourth quarter to win their second road game in franchise history down 14+ points entering the final period.The decisive play was a game-winning two-point conversion with 7:36 left. It stands as the only go-ahead two-point try of Sean Payton's career as a coach.\n7. Week 1: Vikings shock Chicago in J.J. McCarthy's debutThis one feels even more surprising now considering how the season has unfolded for the Vikings. \nThe Vikings offense was lifeless in the first three quarters of J.J. McCarthy's debut until the fourth quarter when he totaled three touchdowns, the most ever by a quarterback in his NFL debut.That and a bunch of Bears miscues helped McCarthy match Steve Young as the second quarterback in the last 45 years with a double-digit, fourth-quarter comeback in an NFL debut. 6. Week 3: Browns steal one in Green BayThe Browns won a game they had no business winning at the height of the NFL's \"block party\" in Week 3. They blocked the Packers' go-ahead field goal attempt and kicked their own game winner from 55 yards, all in the last 30 seconds!\nIt snapped the Packers' 300-game win streak when leading by 10+ points in the final four minutes. Their last loss was in 1967 vs. the Colts when the coaches were Vince Lombardi and Don Shula and the quarterbacks were Bart Starr and Johnny Unitas.5. Week 3: Eagles beat Rams on 'Block Party'The Eagles pulled off their largest comeback win (down 19) since the Miracle at the Meadowlands II in 2010 (DeSean Jackson walk-off punt return TD) in Week 5 vs. the Rams. The way they did it was so stunning I cannot believe there's been four better comebacks this year.\nThe Eagles became the only team in the last 45 years to block two field goals in the fourth quarter of a game. The last one was returned 61 yards for a touchdown by Jordan Davis. Not only did he prevent the Rams from hitting a walk-off field goal, but the 336-pounder poured salt on the wound by making a house call. Davis became the heaviest player in NFL history to return a blocked field goal 50+ yards for a touchdown.\n\n        \n            \n                Overreactions for NFL Week 8: Eagles offense better without A.J. Brown? Bengals playoff hopes dead?\n                \n                    Jeff Kerr                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n4. Week 8: Jets get first win in a remarkable wayThe Jets won one for Nick Mangold on Sunday. They beat the Bengals after trailing 31-16 entering the fourth quarter, good for the second-largest fourth-quarter comeback win in team history (down 15) behind the \"Monday Night Miracle,\" when they beat the Dolphins down 23 in the final period on \"Monday Night Football\" in 2000.An 0-7 team had no business winning that game but it was definitely an emotional one following the death of Mangold at just 41 years old. Like a lot of the comebacks on this list, the way they won added to the shock factor. Running back Breece Hall threw a game-winning touchdown pass to Mason Taylor with 1:54 left. It was the first game-winning touchdown pass by a non-QB in the final two minutes of the fourth quarter in 22 years (Rod Gardner in 2003).\n3. Week 1: Bills start the season off with a bang\"Team of destiny\" talk surrounding the Bills started quickly after Josh Allen and Co. beat the Ravens in Week 1 after trailing by 15 points in the final five minutes.They snapped a 717-game losing streak throughout the NFL by teams down 15+ points in the final five minutes. It was also the first win in regulation in NFL history by a team down 15+ points in the final four minutes.The big swing play was a fumble by Derrick Henry late in the game. The Ravens' questionable play-calling in the final few minutes didn't help either.\n2. Week 5: Cam Ward wins first game after two wild playsThe Titans' only win this season was an absolute gift. Cam Ward won his first career game in Week 5 vs. the Cardinals after his team was on the right side of two wild plays that swung the game 14 points. First, Emari Demercado dropped the ball before crossing the goal line on what would have given the Cardinals a 22-point lead in the fourth quarter. Coach Jonathan Gannon proceeded to berate him on the sidelines.\nSecond, Cam Ward threw an interception, which was then fumbled, kicked around, and recovered by the Titans in the end zone!\nWard technically pulled off the largest road comeback win (down 18) by a rookie No. 1 overall pick. But, as you can see, it took A LOT of luck. 1. Week 7: Broncos pull off first comeback of its kind in 22 yearsAs crazy as the other seven comebacks were, this is hands down tops on the list. The Broncos trailed 19-0 entering the fourth quarter vs. the Giants last week and somehow won. They even trailed 26-8 in the final six minutes. They snapped an NFL-wide 1,606-game losing streak by teams down 18+ points in the final six minutes. The last win had been the Colts on \"Monday Night Football\" in 2003. \nThe Broncos set an NFL record for most points in a game (33) after getting shut out in the first three quarters and Bo Nix became the first player ever with multiple passing touchdowns and multiple rushing touchdowns in a quarter.NFL Next Gen Stats had Denver's win probability at under 1% when they trailed 26-8. \nSo you're saying there's a chance? Yes, that would be one way to describe the 2025 NFL season through eight weeks. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        From preseason No. 1 to being tagged with the overrated label in a matter of weeks, most of the Texas stock nationally was liquidated after a loss at Florida earlier this month. Heisman futures on Arch Manning were ripped up, vaunted personnel defensively was questioned and the expectation was the rest of the SEC slate would lay waste to the struggling Longhorns.Then, Red River happened.The win over then sixth-ranked Oklahoma put all season goals back in front of Texas, which has navigated a pair of upset-minded opponents to set up Saturday's nationally ranked showdown against Vanderbilt in Austin. On the heels of their third straight SEC win following Saturday night's epic 17-point turnaround in the fourth quarter at Mississippi State, the Longhorns are back in control of their own destiny in the SEC title race -- all this amid Steve Sarkisian having to downplay NFL overtures and signs of him losing his fastball as a play caller.Texas is a team nobody in the SEC wants to play given its roster strengths and Manning -- now with a couple clutch wins under his belt as a starter and garnering a warrior label of sorts -- coming into his own after a few big-time plays against Kentucky and Mississippi State on the road. Manning's progression may have hit a roadblock, however, as the former five-star prospect suffered a concussion late in the win over Mississippi State in Week 9. But if Manning picks up where he left off upon his return, that adds fuel to the fire of Texas causing chaos down the stretch. \nEntering this week's playoff projection at CBS Sports for the first time this season, the ninth-ranked Commodores have beaten consecutive top 25 opponents but are 2.5-point underdogs at Texas. Diego Pavia nearly led Vanderbilt to a win over the Longhorns last season before Texas held on and won five straight to land in the SEC Championship Game.\n        \n            \n                Bowl projections: Vanderbilt enters CFP bracket as SEC's fifth team, BYU flexes as new Big 12 frontrunner\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHistory could repeat itself this fall glancing at the Longhorns' season-ending stretch, which includes a trip to Georgia on Nov. 15 followed by back-to-back home games to end the campaign against Arkansas and the SEC's lone remaining unbeaten -- Texas A&M.That rivalry showdown determined who advanced to Atlanta in 2024, and should the Aggies and Longhorns win out, that same scenario will unfold.\nWhy playoff chaos ensues if Texas keeps winningTexas is not one of the five SEC teams currently projected to reach the playoff but pushes ahead of Vanderbilt and Oklahoma in the league's at-large pecking order this weekend if the Longhorns win.Ten wins is the magic number in college football's most competitive conference to grab an at-large invite, and we'll have a better idea of how the selection committee views Texas when they reveal their first rankings on Nov. 4. Say what you want about the Longhorns not looking the part after the overtime win at Kentucky and getting by in Starkville. SEC wins are hard, as players have admitted, and if they're able to take out a couple more top-10 conference titans in the coming weeks, the team we thought was a shoo-in to get back to the bracket will be thriving.\nAs it stands, the SEC and Big Ten are the only multi-bid guarantees in this season's playoff. With seven teams inside the current AP top 10 from those leagues, including all of the top five, it's obvious the SEC and Big Ten will be viewed favorably by the committee.Further success at Texas poses potential issues for teams like Notre Dame, Texas Tech and Miami due to the threat of an additional SEC team getting in over a potential runner-up finisher in the Big 12 or ACC. If Miami wins out and loses to Georgia Tech in the ACC Championship Game, the Hurricanes will be 11-2 with three ranked wins this season.If Texas wins out and, say, loses to Alabama in the SEC Championship Game, the Longhorns would be 10-3 with four nationally ranked wins -- all against top 10 teams. You can see why this would be a problem for Mario Cristobal and Miami, as an example.\nNotre Dame's best-case scenario is a 10-2 finish with ranked wins over USC and likely Navy, as long as the unbeaten Midshipmen handle North Texas this weekend. And, in Texas Tech's case, the Red Raiders need to win out and take the Big 12 to guarantee a spot in the playoff.This chain reaction-like event that could come to fruition should Texas win its final four games has major implications outside of the SEC for programs assuming they'll be in the playoff with solid finishes.However, it's not that simple, and during a season filled with parity, we've come to expect the unexpected.\n            ",

In the 2024 season, he passed for 3,928 yards, threw 26 touchdowns against 11 interceptions, and finished with a passer rating of 93.5 over 16 games. Through the first seven games of the 2025 campaign, Mahomes has already thrown for 1,800 yards with 14 touchdowns and just two interceptions with a passer rating of 102.9. While his 2024 numbers dipped slightly compared to some of his peak seasons, the early returns in 2025 show a marked uptick in efficiency and ball control. Mahomes' also has 250 rushing yards and a team-high four rushing touchdowns in 2025. See who else to roster here.Part of Kaylor's optimal NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering Commanders wide receiver Deebo Samuel. The former South Carolina standout has gotten off to a solid start in his first season with the Commanders. In 2024, while still with the San Francisco 49ers, he recorded 51 receptions for 670 receiving yards -- an average of 13.1 yards per catch -- and scored three receiving touchdowns. In six games in 2025 with Washington, he has amassed 34 catches for 315 yards (an average of 9.3 yards per reception) and has already recorded three receiving touchdowns. He's also notched eight carries for 45 yards and a score on the ground. While his yardage per catch has decreased and overall production is down compared to his best seasons, the early touchdown pace and involvement in a new offense suggest he may be carving out a meaningful role despite the transition. You can see the rest of Kaylor's NFL DFS picks here.New users can see the latest FanDuel promo code to get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:How to build NFL DFS lineups for Monday Night FootballKaylor is also targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Monday Night Football.'

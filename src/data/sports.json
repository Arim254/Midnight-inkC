    "body": "\nA divisional rivalry will, fittingly, resume in the 2026 NFL divisional round as the Seattle Seahawks (14-3) host the San Francisco 49ers (12-5) on Saturday. These teams both began and ended the regular season versus one another with the Niners winning at Seattle in Week 1, while the Seahawks won at San Fran in Week 18. The latter contest notched the No. 1 seed in the 2026 NFL playoffs for the Seahawks in the NFC as they are coming off a bye. The Niners, meanwhile, are coming off a 23-19 road upset of Philadelphia in a Sunday Wild Card matchup. Sam Darnold (oblique) is listed as questionable for Seattle.Kickoff is at 8 p.m. ET from Lumen Field in Seattle. The Seahawks are 7-point favorites in the latest Seahawks vs. 49ers odds at DraftKings Sportsbook, while the over/under for total points scored is 44.5.

The Niners also covered in that contest, and Seattle has lost versus the spread in each of its last two home games as the Seahawks are 8-1 ATS on the road but just 4-4 ATS at home. The 49ers have a top 10 offense in both points scored and total yards, and they rank No. 1 in the all-critical third-down offense. They also have the turnover differential edge over Seattle, as the Seahawks' 28 giveaways were the second-most in the regular season. San Fran can also rely on proven postseason performer like Brock Purdy, who is 5-1 in postseason games he's started and finished, while Darnold had two turnovers and lost in his lone playoff game. See which team to back at SportsLine. Bet Brock Purdy to go Over 231.5 passing yards at DraftKings:\nWhy the Seahawks can coverOf the three previous times that Seattle earned a No. 1 seed, it advanced to the Super Bowl each time. That will bring it confidence, as will defeating San Francisco, 13-3, when it last took the field in Week 18. That tied for the fewest points by the Niners since Kyle Shanahan's debut season in 2017, and now San Fran will have to adjust to life without George Kittle (Achilles) while facing Seattle's No. 1 scoring defense. Additionally, the NFL schedule makers didn't do San Francisco any favors with giving it a short week after a Sunday Wild Card game on the other coast in Philadelphia. Teams are 5-10 in the playoffs since 2002 with a short week versus a team coming off a bye, and the Seahawks franchise is 10-1 over its last 11 home postseason games. See which team to back at SportsLine.Bet Darnold to go Over 1.5 passing touchdowns at DraftKings:\nHow to make 49ers vs. Seahawks picksRoberts has analyzed Seahawks vs. 49ers from every angle and he's leaning Over on the point total.

    "body": "\n        Eleven Kentucky Derby hopefuls will enter the gates at the Fair Grounds Race Course in New Orleans when the 2026 Lecomte Stakes unfolds on Saturday. It's one of the premier winter races on the road to 2026 Kentucky Derby qualification with the winner earning 20 points. It also serves as a rematch between Crown the Buckeye and Chip Honcho, who finished in the top three at the 2025 Gun Runner Stakes in December.Post time for the Lecomte Stakes 2026 is 7 p.m. ET. Crown the Buckeye, who finished third a the Gun Runner, is the 4-1 favorite in the 2026 Lecomte Stakes odds. Chip Honcho, the winner in that race, is second on the Lecomte odds board at 9-2. Thunder Buck is 6-1, while seven of the eight other horses in the field are priced between 8-1 and 12-1. With several Kentucky Derby contenders set to enter the gate, you'll want to see what SportsLine horse racing expert Gene Menez has to say before making any 2026 Lecomte Stakes picks or horse racing predictions.New users can jump on the latest TwinSpires promo code CBSSPORTS to receive up to $400 in bonus bets to wager on almost any track:Menez, who called Disco Time's win in this race last year, is one SportsLine's top horse racing expert and he has a lengthy history of calling winners. He's had several huge calls recently, including giving out 18-1 Mystik Dan as a live longshot in the Kentucky Derby in 2014. Menez excels on horse racing's biggest days. In 2024 he crushed the late Pick 4 on Breeders' Cup Saturday for a $5,303 windfall. Last year he nailed the winner, trifecta and superfecta in the Florida Derby for a $529.60 score and the winner and trifecta in the Blue Grass Stakes for a $761.96 jackpot. Hit the late Pick 4 on Kentucky Oaks day for $915.48. In the Kentucky Derby, he hammered the exacta and trifecta for a $1,045 payout. And in November, Menez finished 115th out of 643 entries in the Breeders' Cup Betting Challenge, the biggest live-money handicapping tournament in the country. Anyone who has followed him on betting apps could have been way up.For the Lecomte Stakes 2026, Menez has handicapped the 2026 Lecomte Stakes field, made his picks and constructed his best bets. You can head to SportsLine now to see them.Top 2026 Lecomte Stakes predictionsOne of Menez's surprising Lecomte Stakes picks: He is fading the favorite, Crown the Buckeye, who is going off at 4-1. The Mike Maker-trained colt currently sits in 29th in the Derby qualifying standings with the three points he picked up at the Gun Runner Stakes. However, he won his prior two races -- neither of which earned Derby points -- setting him up as a top 3-year-old contender in 2026.Menez, however, is putting more stock in his last race than the previous two. He's particularly concerned about how he faded late in that 1 1/16-mile run, which is the same distance as the Lecomte. With Chip Honcho already holding a victory against Crown the Buckeye and several other intriguing options in the mid-priced range, Menez doesn't like the value of the favorite in this 11-horse field. See which horses to back here.New users can target the 1/ST BET promo code 500BET which offers up to $500 in wagering credits for the 2025 Breeders' Cup Classic:How to make 2026 Lecomte Stakes bets, picksInstead, Menez's top pick is a longshot who \"should be the one to catch.\" Menez also is high on another longshot who should \"improve with distance and experience.\" You can see who they are, and get all of Menez's 2026 Lecomte Stakes picks, over at SportsLine. Which horse wins the Lecomte Stakes 2026, and how should you construct your wagers?

With that type of potency, no team has more against-the-spread victories than Los Angeles' 12 this season, while the Bears are just 2-7 ATS over their last nine divisional round playoff games. The L.A. offense sometimes overshadows the other side of the ball, which is elite in itself. No team has allowed fewer rushing scores than Los Angeles, which also finds itself in the top 10 in interceptions, sacks and passer rating allowed. That defense contrasts with what Chicago offers as the Bears rank 29th in total defense and allowed 6.0 yards per play in the regular season, which was the third-most in the NFL. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Bears can coverThe Windy City has certainly provided a home-field advantage for the Bears who are 8-2 both straight-up and ATS over their last 10 home games versus the Rams. This season, the team is 11-4-1 ATS over its last 16 games, while the Rams are the only team playing this weekend that lost versus the spread in the Wild Card Round. The Rams have lost against the line in three of their last four road games, and Chicago's highly efficient offense can exploit Los Angeles' suddenly leaky defense. No team has committed fewer turnovers than the Bears, who also possess top-10 rankings in both points scored and yards gained, while the Rams have given up an average of 30 points over their last five contests. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Rams vs. Bears     picksSportsLine's model has simulated Bears vs. Rams 10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 52 combined points.

    "body": "\n        MIAMI BEACH, Fla. -- The pursuit starts with a roadblock. After Indiana coach Curt Cignetti's viral post-Peach Bowl moment of, \"I'm really not thinking about the next game, I'm thinking about cracking open a beer,\" it demanded further investigation. \nFortunately, CBS Sports was willing and able to do the hard investigative work to answer a critical question: What kind of beer does Curt Cignetti drink? And at the College Football Playoff media day on Saturday, we were intent on figuring out the answer. The quest began in an unlikely place -- Miami running backs coach Matt Merritt. He spent two seasons on Cignetti's Elon staff and another year with him at James Madison. Merritt still keeps in touch with members of the Indiana staff, including offensive coordinator Mike Shanahan. \nNo luck. \"Couldn't tell you,\" Merritt told CBS Sports. \"Does he relax? Sure, he's a human being. I don't know what kind of beer he drinks.\"If the old running backs coach doesn't know the answer, perhaps the current one does. John Miller has been with Cignetti for six seasons, going back to his days as a graduate assistant for him at James Madison. He's on the offensive staff, too, so he's around Cignetti plenty. Miller confirmed Cignetti did have a beer after the Peach Bowl, but couldn't remember the specifics. \n\"I don't know what his favorite type of beer is,\" Miller told CBS Sports, \"but he'll celebrate for a little bit and then it's on to the next opponent.\" The investigation feels like it's hit a standstill. For a man who gets the same Chipotle order each day -- rice, beans and chicken with a side of guacamole, according to The Wall Street Journal -- there should be an obvious answer here. Cignetti is rigidly committed to a routine; this isn't the kind of guy who is ordering whatever local IPA is on tap. The fastidious Cignetti is the type to say \"No thanks\" when he orders a Coke but gets asked if Pepsi is OK instead. Yet, we're 0-for-2 with people who know him well. And then a breakthrough with Chandler Whitmer.Whitmer, Indiana's quarterbacks coach and co-offensive coordinator, has only been with Cignetti for this season and admits there's only been one focus during their time together. \n\"He's all ball pretty much all the time,\" Whitmer told CBS Sports. \"There's been very few moments where we've been outside the building.\"Still, Whitmer thinks he knows the answer. \"Probably a cold one,\" he said. \"That's really all it is. He's had a Hoosier brand beer. Just a cold one and then we're moving on to the next one. It's almost him closing the chapter to that game.\"Finally, a lead. Upland Brewing, a Bloomington-based brewery, produces a Hoosier Gameday Lager, billed as \"the first ever Indiana University athletics branded beer.\" Its yeast is of bohemian lager ilk. Its hops are cluster and saaz. We really don't know what any of those things mean, per se, but the low ABV of 4.7% is in line with the image we have in our heads of a coach enjoying himself, ever so slightly, but not getting grounded for the next morning's film study. This feels right. \nWe reached out to James Ferguson, Cignetti's director of football operations (DFO) at James Madison. Ferguson was with Cig at IUP, Elon and then JMU. He was Cignetti's right-hand man and had plenty of experiences with Cignetti away from the building, from playing golf to dinners to, yes, drinking beers. His career forever changed, in part, because of beer. He hadn't initially followed Cignetti to Elon when he bumped into his former boss and his wife, Manette, at a bar around IUP's campus. \"I bought him and his wife a beer,\" Ferguson told CBS Sports. \"Someone had told me down the road when his DFO left that was a moment in time he realized I was loyal to him, and he awarded that loyalty by offering me the job.\" Ferguson joined Cignetti that spring as his DFO at Elon before following him to JMU. If anyone should know this answer, it'd be Ferguson. He had to know all his boss' preferences. \"Used to be Mich Ultra,\" he texted. \"Can't imagine he changed.\"\nCignetti, a confirmed light beer man? Miller, the Indiana running backs coach, doesn't know the definitive answer, but Michelob Ultra rings true to him. \"He might be,\" he said. \"I can see that. He likes what he likes.\"\n        \n            \n                Curt Cignetti's eye for coaching talent built college football's best staff. Here's how.\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThere's one final assistant to talk to. Indiana special teams coordinator and tight ends coach Grant Cain has been with Cignetti for seven seasons, dating back to the James Madison days. Most of their time together has been doing Cignetti's favorite thing, which is watching and breaking down film. \"Coach's perfect day is just watching tape,\" Cain told CBS Sports. \"Get him in a dark room and watch some film.\"\nHe has witnessed Cignetti drink a beer, and believes he knows what he likes. \"I think if he had his choice,\" Cain said, \"it'd be a double IPA of sorts.\"If you're not a beer person, a double IPA is about as different as possible than a Michelob Ultra. A Mich Ultra has 95 calories and is 4.2% alcohol. A double IPA is more like 300 calories and an 8 percent alcohol rate. They pack a punch if you're not careful. With conflicting information, there's only one person left to ask. \"It was Hoosier beer,\" Cignetti said about his post-Peach Bowl beverage. \"You ever hear of Hoosier beer?\"Whitmer nailed it. \"Just one,\" Cignetti said. \"At my age when you drink two, you fall asleep.\"On Monday night if Indiana can finish its dream season undefeated and as college football's new national champion, Cignetti will be excited for the players, for the coaches, for the university administrators and everyone else who has sacrificed to get to this moment. \nAnd yes, the 64-year-old will be excited to celebrate with a cold beer. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The New York Giants made a massive move late Wednesday night, as they began working to finalize an agreement with former Baltimore Ravens head coach John Harbaugh to be their next head coach. It took longer than expected, but the New York Giants have finalized their contract with Harbaugh to be their new lead man, sources told CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones. NFL Media reports the deal is for five years. Harbaugh was immediately the most sought-after name on the market once he and the Ravens parted ways, and the Giants struck quickly to work on a deal with Harbaugh before he could take reported meetings with the Tennessee Titans and Atlanta Falcons this weekend. From the Giants' perspective, this has to be considered an excellent hire -- an \"A,\" if you will.\n        \n            \n                John Harbaugh's first 100 days: The blueprint to rebuild the Giants\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHarbaugh was extremely successful with the Ravens, compiling a 180-113 regular-season record and making the playoffs 12 times in 18 seasons, going 13-11 in the postseason and winning a Super Bowl back in 2012. A CEO-style head coach who was a former special-teams coordinator, Harbaugh was nevertheless at the forefront of leaguewide trends like aggressive fourth-down decision-making and he showed the ability to adapt with the times and with the construction of his roster, repeatedly seeking out new ideas on both sides of the ball so that he could mold the system around his players rather than try to fit square pegs into round holes. \nHe'll bring immediate stability and competence to a Giants organization that has been desperate for it over at least the last decade, as it has cycled through coach after coach and disappointment after disappointment. He should also be able to bring with him a strong coaching staff, given the connections he has made over the years and the various coaches who have worked with him at one time or another. Reports have already circulated that he'll bring Todd Monken to New York as his offensive coordinator, which would be a very good hire as the Giants look to build their future around Jaxson Dart. Lamar Jackson was already a superstar before Monken got to Baltimore, but he certainly helped take Jackson's game to another level. If he can do the same for Dart, that would be extremely beneficial as the Giants look to improve after being one of the worst teams in the league. We don't yet know who Harbaugh would like to bring with him on the defensive side of the ball, but he's repeatedly found top defensive minds over the years. He's had coaches like Rex Ryan, Vic Fangio, Chuck Pagano, Dean Pees, Teryl Austin, Wink Martindale, Steve Spagnuolo, Mike Macdonald, Leslie Frazier, Jesse Minter, Zach Orr, Anthony Weaver and Dennard Wilson work under him as either coordinators or position coaches at one time or another over the last decade-plus, and the Ravens have routinely had one of the NFL's better defenses. A great deal of that obviously has to do with the talent they have been able to land on that side of the ball, thanks to an excellent front office, but Harbaugh has also brought in a bunch of strong defensive coaches, as mentioned.\nHarbaugh's age (he'll turn 64 early next season) and the Ravens' recent propensity for blowing leads are slight concerns here, but they're mitigated by his long track record of success and the Giants' desperate need for someone who can professionalize the organization. You can, of course, find that type of coach anywhere if you turn over the right stones, but the Giants obviously valued Harbaugh's pedigree highly, and they moved quickly to strike on the man many viewed as the top candidate available this cycle.What others are sayingCBS Sports senior NFL writer Pete Prisco was even more effusive in his praise of the Harbaugh hiring.\"For him, it's an 'A',\" Prisco said. \"It's the best job out there. And I said that when all the jobs opened up. And people say, 'What are you saying?' Well, it's the Giants. The New York Giants. You're in New York. \n\"And not only that, you have a lot of young talent on that team to build around. If you look at the NFL, what do you want? You want a quarterback and you want pass rushers. Well, they have it. If you believe in Jaxson Dart -- and I think he can be successful -- then you have the quarterback and the pass rushers, so it makes sense from that standpoint. So, from his standpoint, it's an A. \"From the Giants' standpoint, A+. You targeted him, you went and got him, and now it's all on you to make sure it works around him. I think this is a no-brainer hire for both sides. If I were John Harbaugh, that's the job I would want. If I were the New York Giants, John Harbaugh's the guy I would want.\"CBS Sports HQ NFL analyst Danny Kanell echoed many of those sentiments. \"I will give it an 'A+',\" Kanell said. \"This was the only coach that would come in and have us talking about this Giants organization as potentially a playoff team. And I don't think it'll only be me. With the young nucleus of talent that the Giants have on this roster, with the track record of success in building a winning culture, with the coordinator that he's most likely going to bring in with him, I think this is a home run hire for the Giants.\"\nYou're not going to find very many people out there who don't think this hiring is one of the better hirings of the cycle, no matter who lands the other available jobs. Harbaugh was sought after for a reason, and the Giants were able to land him before anyone else had a chance. Even if it doesn't work out, the process that led here was likely solid, even if it seemed somewhat predetermined that the Giants would zero in on Harbaugh if he ever became available.\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe 2025 NFL playoffs are down to just eight teams as the divisional round takes place Saturday and Sunday. The Seattle Seahawks and Denver Broncos are back in action after a first-round bye last week, and each team faces a tough task as they host the San Francisco 49ers and Buffalo Bills, respectively. The Houston Texans head to New England for a date with the Patriots on Sunday after these teams knocked off the Pittsburgh Steelers and Los Angeles Chargers, respectively, and the weekend concludes with the Chicago Bears hosting the Los Angeles Rams after each team won a close one last week. Some teams are looking much better in the injury department than others entering the Divisional Round, so here, we break down the top injuries bettors should know before placing wagers, and also share the latest NFL betting odds from DraftKings Sportsbook. Buffalo Bills at Denver Broncos (4:30 p.m. ET, Saturday)BUFF LB Terrel Bernard (calf, out)BUFF DT Ed Oliver (biceps, will play)BUFF S Jordan Poyer (hamstring, out)BUFF CB Maxwell Hairston (ankle, out)BUFF RB Ty Johnson (ankle, out)BUFF WR Curtis Samuel (elbow, will play)BUFF WR Tyrell Shavers (knee, out)BUFF WR Gabe Davis (knee, out)\nIf you want to see the difference a first-round bye makes, look no further than this matchup. Buffalo is beat up on both sides of the ball, with linebacker Terrel Bernard and safety Jordan Poyer both out. Rookie cornerback Maxwell Hairston is also out. Offensively, receivers Tyrell Shavers and Gabe Davis each suffered torn ACLs last week, while No. 2 back Ty Johnson remains out of Buffalo's backfield. The Bills activated defensive tackle Ed Oliver and receiver Curtis Samuel from injured reserve, giving the team a boost on both sides of the ball. Both were officially questionable but will suit up in the Divisional Round.Denver is a 1.5-point favorite at home, and the total is 45.5.San Francisco 49ers at Seattle Seahawks (8 p.m. ET, Saturday)SF TE George Kittle (Achilles, out)SF WR Ricky Pearsall (knee, will play)SF Fred Warner (ankle, out)SEA QB Sam Darnold (oblique, will play)\nIt's always a concern when a player surprisingly pops up on the final injury report, and it's especially noteworthy when it's your starting quarterback. That's the case for Seattle's Sam Darnold as he popped up on Thursday's injury report with an oblique injury that resulted in a questionable designation for Saturday. Darnold is active, however, though reports stated he hadn't thrown a football since suffering the injury on Thursday. As for the 49ers, star tight end George Kittle is out for the rest of the postseason with a torn Achilles, veteran linebacker Fred Warner won't be activated and second-year receiver Ricky Pearsall is questionable due to a nagging knee injury.  Seattle is a 6.5-point favorite at home. The total is 43.5 after sitting at 45.5 for most of the week.Houston Texans at New England Patriots (3 p.m. ET, Sunday)HOU WR Nico Collins (concussion, out)NE CB Christian Gonzalez (concussion, will play)\nThe Texans' offense has been limited at times throughout the year, but it always had one constant in star receiver Nico Collins. That unit will not have Collins in this pivotal matchup with the Patriots, however, as he's out with a concussion he suffered in last week's win over the Steelers. With Collins out, Houston's more unproven receivers like Jayden Higgins and Jaylin Noel will have to step up as primary targets for C.J. Stroud. Making things harder is star cornerback Christian Gonzalez has cleared concussion protocol for New England and will play.The Patriots are 3-point favorites, and the total is 40.5 -- the lowest of this four-game slate.Los Angeles Rams at Chicago Bears (6:30 p.m. ET, Sunday)CHI WR Rome Odunze (foot, questionable)\nThe Rams are in a good spot when it comes to the health department, and the biggest injury news for the Bears is that second-year receiver Rome Odunze is questionable with a foot injury that cost him considerable time this year. Odunze played last week and told reporters he expects to suit up against the Rams.The Rams are 3.5-point road favorites. The total is 45.5.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Kentucky rallied from a 17-point deficit to stun No. 24 Tennessee 80-78 on the road Saturday, as the Wildcats completed their third straight double-digit comeback in SEC play.Just as they did at LSU on Wednesday — when Kentucky rolled from 18 down to win at the buzzer — veteran guards Denzel Aberdeen and Otega Oweh led the charge against the Volunteers.Oweh's transition dunk with 34 seconds remaining gave UK (12-6, 3-2 SEC) its first lead of the game at 78-77 and prolonged a dreadful finishing stretch for the Volunteers (12-6, 2-3), who did not make a basket from the field over the final 5:38.The senior guard finished with 10 points and two steals in the second half. Aberdeen scored 18 of his 22 points in the second half including seven straight to open the second half as Kentucky narrowed a 13-point deficit to eight. While Kentucky's comeback win over Tennessee bore some uncanny resemblance to its wins over LSU and Mississippi State, which also required big rallies, it illuminated the play of some different characters.\nMo Dioubate came off the bench to play 27 minutes, which is more than he logged in the last two games combined. The physical Alabama transfer provided some desperately needed toughness on the glass for UK after the Wildcats grabbed just one offensive rebound in the first half.\nWith Dioubate playing all but three minutes in the second half, UK grabbed 10 offensive rebounds, which it converted into 17 points. Consequently, Kentucky attempted 36 shots in the second half compared to just 22 for Tennessee. Freshman guard Jasper Johnson also added 12 points for Kentucky.Johnson's contributionsThere is mounting evidence to suggest Kentucky is a better team with Johnson on the floor. With UK's offense reeling early, the slender lefty kept the Wildcats in it with eight points off the bench in a span of fewer than six minutes. He also chipped in a couple of jumpers over the last three minutes of the first half just as Tennessee's lead ballooned to 17 points. Johnson's late surge helped the Wildcats close the half on a 7-1 run and remain within striking distance.\nIn addition to his 5-of-6 shooting performance, Johnson finished with a team-high four assists. He leads the team in assists per 40 minutes and is the most natural passer on the team now that Jaland Lowe has been ruled out for the season. Even before the strong offensive performance from Johnson, data showed UK has tended to be better with him on the floor. \nIn games against high-major opposition, five of the Wildcats' 10 most-efficient 3-man combinations involved Johnson, per CBB Analytics. Yet, he's still been struggling to get steady minutes. That ought to change moving forward. If anyone can replace the passing and on-ball playmaking that Lowe provided before UK shut him down for the season, it's Johnson, and he proved it again on Saturday at Tennessee.Bracketology implicationsThe win marks a gold-plated Quad 1 victory for Kentucky and improves the Wildcats to 3-5 in Quad 1 opportunities, providing significant insulation for the Wildcats' at-large resume. The win will have little risk of slipping outside of Quad 1, as there is virtually no scenario in which Tennessee will fall outside the top 75 of the NET. As a result, the Wildcats are expected to solidify themselves as a No. 9 seed in CBS Sports Bracketology, which calculates seedings as if Selection Sunday were tomorrow.\nThe initial CBS Sports Bracketology projection calls for Tennessee to slip from a No. 6 seed to a No. 7 seed. For the moment, the loss is a Quad 2 defeat for the Volunteers, marking their first loss outside of Quad 1. However, if UK moves into the top 30 of the NET (the Wildcats were No. 34 before the win), then it will be a Quad 1 loss.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        LEIPZIG, Germany – In the late morning hours on a sunny Saturday, the impressive Baroque buildings that make up Leipzig's city center welcomed a batch of locals who popped in and out of shops of their choice – and stopped in their tracks as they stumbled upon Bayern Munich's team buses. Some slowed down as they strolled past, many took out their phones to take a picture, while others stopped outside with seven hours to go until kickoff against RB Leipzig.Such is the oversized presence of Germany's record champions that even as Leipzig started the game in impressive fashion, asserting control over the match in almost no time at all, that the other shoe felt destined to drop.Leipzig were more than capable of inflicting damage on Bayern, Ole Werner's side on track to finish inside the UEFA Champions League berths with half a season to go. Christoph Baumgartner's shot in the third minute was a warning but Romulo's attempt two minutes later established a pattern – the hosts could work around Bayern's defense thanks to their trademark intense style. Yan Diomande, arguably the find of the Bundesliga season after Leipzig signed inexperienced 19-year-old from Leganes, was troubling Bayern left back Hiroki Ito and 20-year-old forward Antonio Nusa had more than his fair share of attempts on goal. Leipzig limited Bayern to their lowest expected goal tally in the first half of a Bundesliga match all season long with a tally of just 0.63, but there was just one problem. The hosts had not put their chances away, underperforming on the 2.03 expected goals they had generated along the way.\"First half was tough, to be honest,\" Bayern's Harry Kane said post-match. \"We expected them to come out with a lot of energy, a lot of intensity and that's exactly what happened. We just weren't quite good enough with the ball. I felt that we gave a lot of balls away, which gave them momentum.\"\nIt was the perfect set-up for a Bayern comeback that called back of their longstanding dominance, even as Vincent Kompany puts his own spin on things in his second season in charge of the team. Every single reminder of Bayern's ability to perform was on clear display in the second half, even as Leipzig remained competitive with the score at 2-1 in the visitors' favor heading into the final 10 minutes. Serge Gnabry and Harry Kane had Bayern ahead by the 70th minute, the form that makes them a contender for the Champions League title this season on full display.\"When a team likes to press like they do, sometimes I like to drop even into defensive areas to see if the center backs are fully committed to come all the way,\" Kane said about the team's style of play. \"It takes a lot for teams to really commit that way and I think that's why you sometimes see me in that kind of [No.] 6 position, that [No.] 8 position in the half-turn. In terms of in the final third, we don't really play with an out-and-out [No.] 9. We almost play with two [No.] 10s with wingers who come attack inside. … The center backs, maybe they're not quite sure to go in with me or to stay back.\"Then came the inarguable truths of Germany's top flight. Kane, who is currently chasing the Bundesliga's single season goalscoring record set by Robert Lewandowski when he scored 41 for Bayern during the 2020-21 campaign, is a cheat code in his own right. Kompany was able to bring Michael Olise into the game as a second half substitute, the France international putting on an impressive display with three assists and the final goal of the game. It is not exactly difficult to recall seasons where Bayern were second-best but year after year, the Bundesliga title is theirs to lose because of the financial and historical advantages that pave the way to build Germany's greatest squad over and over again.\n\"Even when they went  2-1 up, we had some chances to come back into the game,\" Leipzig goalkeeper Peter Gulacsi said. \"After the third goal, we just opened up and it was unnecessary and a bit disappointing from our side to concede another two because I thought for a majority of the game, we played a really strong game.\"Leipzig's commitment to an attack-minded game plan was eventually their downfall, which eventually acted as a perfect invitation for Bayern.\"We lost a bit of control, our shape,\" Gulacsi said. \"We were maybe taking too much risks and this is a team that will punish you straight away on the counterattack and that's what happened. We were not closing, we were not marking them enough for the last two goals and they really punished us.\"\nLeipzig, as a result, ended up on the wrong side of the Bayern Munich experience, feeling the brutal effects of the visitors' unrelenting ability.\"It's hard to keep your focus,\" Leipzig goalscorer Romulo said about the game state after Kane's go-ahead goal, \"and then they push. They always push and they have top players so they get chances and they score five. It's to not to turn off the mind.\"Even if Leipzig had quickly created a pattern of excellence in the first half, Bayern reverted to a familiar habit of their own to close out the game.\n\"We knew in the second half to be calm,\" Kane said. \"The spaces will open up as the game gets more stretched. The last 30 minutes, it's happened a lot this season, and that's exactly what happened. We took our moments when we needed to. Manu[el Neuer] made some incredible saves when we needed him, some good blocks from the center backs and then we just kind of grew into the game.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\nMonday night's College Football Playoff National Championship Game between No. 1 Indiana and No. 10 Miami shapes up as a grueling, physical battle between two teams that have embraced that identity all season. The unbeaten Hoosiers are trying to become college football's first 16-0 national champion, but they must get past a resurgent Hurricanes team playing on its home field.Miami's path has been anything but easy. The Hurricanes knocked off No. 7 Texas A&M on the road, eliminated No. 2 Ohio State in the Cotton Bowl and outlasted No. 6 Ole Miss in the Fiesta Bowl to reach the title game. Powered by a massive offensive line, Miami has created running lanes for Mark Fletcher Jr. while quarterback Carson Beck distributes the ball to elite playmakers such as Malachi Toney, giving the Hurricanes a balanced, efficient attack.First-year defensive coordinator Corey Heatherman has elevated Miami's defense into one of the nation's best, bringing to life fourth-year coach Mario Cristobal's vision of a big, punishing roster. Still, the question remains whether that physicality is enough to test Indiana.The Hoosiers have overwhelmed everyone in their path, blasting No. 9 Alabama 38-3 in the Rose Bowl and dismantling No. 5 Oregon 56-22 in the Peach Bowl. With Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Fernando Mendoza at the controls and no obvious weaknesses on the roster, Indiana enters as a more-than-touchdown favorite.Second-year coach Curt Cignetti has orchestrated one of the most remarkable turnarounds in college football history, putting Indiana on the brink of its first national championship.Where to watch Miami vs. IndianaDate: Monday, Jan.

Indiana\n                    \n    \n    Tom Fornelli: At what point does everybody start listening to what Indiana's been telling them all season? It has blown out Alabama and Oregon in consecutive playoff games and comes into the championship in much better shape than the Miami Hurricanes do health-wise. I don't expect we see a blowout along the lines of what the Rose and Peach Bowls provided, but I do expect the outcome will be clear before the fourth quarter starts. Pick: Indiana - 8.5 | Indiana 31, Miami 13Chip Patterson: I do think that Miami has the defense to be able to limit what Fernando Mendoza can do pushing the ball deep down the field and also a better rushing attack than Ohio State, which should help no bungling red zone opportunities like the Buckeyes did in the Big Ten title game. The Hoosiers' efficiency and effectiveness should keep them in control most of the game, but the playmaking potential should give Miami enough splash plays to keep it interesting. As long as Miami executes on its scoring chances, it will have a chance to win, but I've got Indiana (best TD% red zone defense in the country) winning those key plays to emerge as 16-0 national champions. Pick: Indiana -8.5 | Indiana 30, Miami 20Brandon Marcello: Miami is still the most physical, violent team remaining in the playoff. Indiana has been unbreakable all season, even in a pair of close calls against Penn State and Iowa, but this Hurricanes team is relentless along the offensive and defensive lines. The problem for Miami is that it still doesn't quite trust quarterback Carson Beck to throw deep, leading to more underneath throws. Even against Ole Miss, drives stalled in the second half when the Hurricanes pulled away from running the ball with Mark Fletcher Jr. Indiana's offense gets a lot of attention with Heisman winner Fernando Mendoza, but it's the defense that has won games. I trust both quarterbacks in 2-minute situations, but Mendoza protects the ball and Beck is a bit more unpredictable. This will be a slugfest at times, but Indiana will pull away to make this the eighth straight title game with the champion winning by double digits. Pick: Indiana -8.5 | Indiana 31, Miami 21Shehan Jeyarajah: Indiana has been a perfect football team in 2025, and it will ultimately end with an elusive first national championship. It won't come easy. Miami's top-rated defensive line will force mistakes, including at least one turnover from Heisman winner Fernando Mendoza. However, Mendoza's legend will be cemented with a fourth-quarter touchdown to ice the game and deliver the Hoosiers an unlikely title. Pick: Indiana - 8.5 | Indiana 27, Miami 17David Cobb: Miami's offensive line is sturdy enough to prevent Indiana's defensive front from completely taking over, a necessity if the Hurricanes hope to stay within striking distance. On the other side, Miami has enough punch up front -- led by Rueben Bain Jr. and Akeem Mesidor -- to make the Hoosiers uncomfortable at times. Ultimately, Indiana looks like a team of destiny and should win outright. But Miami is capable of turning this into a fight. Pick: Miami +8.5 | Indiana 27, Miami 20Chris Hummer: Miami is playing a national championship game at home. What a story. What an opportunity. What a moment. The Hurricanes can't lose it, right? Well ... here comes Indiana. It feels ridiculous to type that with a 15-0 Indiana. It's Indiana! History tells us this isn't possible, but Curt Cignetti has created a monster in Bloomington. They're the most well-coached, most disciplined and best team in the country. Plus, they have a Heisman Trophy-winning QB and, if you talk to coaches around the sport, have a roster that athletically matches up with anyone. As crazy as it feels to write, I'm picking Indiana to win a national championship. How could I not? Maybe Miami finds a bit more magic at home. But this has been the season of Indiana. As long as Indiana's o-line can hold up on the edges, it wins this game. Pick: Miami +8.5 | Indiana 24, Miami 21Who will win and cover in Indiana vs. Miami?

    "body": "\n        Only one ticket to the AFC Championship will be punched on Sunday afternoon when the Houston Texans and New England Patriots duke it out from Foxborough in the divisional round. Both clubs emerged out of wild card weekend victorious, thanks largely to some tremendous efforts on the defensive side of the ball. Against Pittsburgh, Houston engulfed Aaron Rodgers and the Steelers offense, holding them to just six points in a blowout win that saw two touchdowns scored by the defense. They also allowed Pittsburgh to move the chains on just two of its 14 third-down opportunities. Meanwhile, New England had an equally stellar day defensively in its win over the Chargers. They were able to take down Justin Herbert six times in the winning effort, while holding the L.A. offense to a mere field goal. With those defenses hitting their strides, it poses quite a challenge for two of the brightest young quarterbacks that the league has to offer, C.J. Stroud and Drake Maye. For Stroud, this is his third consecutive year advancing to the divisional round, but he has stopped short of a conference championship berth in his prior two visits to this playoff plateau. As for Maye, he's looking to become the eighth-youngest quarterback all-time to win a divisional round game. So, the stage is set quite nicely for a heck of a game at Gillette Stadium. Before we dive further into this matchup, however, let's make sure you have all the information you need to check out this game. \nWhere to watch Texans vs. Patriots liveDate: Sunday, Jan. 18 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Gillette Stadium (Foxborough)TV: ESPN, ABC | Stream: fubo, try for freeOdds: Patriots -3, O/U 40.5 (odds via DraftKings Sportsbook)\nKey questionsCan the left side of Patriots OL hold up?\nThe left side of New England's offensive line -- spearheaded by rookies Will Campbell (left tackle) and Jared Wilson (left guard) -- had a game to forget against the Chargers last week. Campbell finished his evening allowing five total pressures to go along with a sack, while Wilson also gave up five pressures and two sacks. No bueno. Drake Maye was hurried quite a bit in that game, which contributed to his two turnovers (an interception and a fumble). The challenge only gets tougher now that they'll have to fend off a lethal Texans pass rush headlined by Will Anderson and Danielle Hunter. Houston finished second in the NFL with a 42.5% pressure rate this season, and if they can get to Maye early and often, it'll drastically tip the scales in the Texans' favor.   Will C.J. Stroud protect the football? \nWhat got lost during Houston's dominating win over the Steelers on Monday night was that Stroud had a bad game. While the Texans dropped 30 points for the game, 13 of those points were scored by the defense. The most jarring aspect of Stroud's performance was his inability to protect the football. He threw an ill-advised interception in the red zone and had five total fumbles in the game (two lost). The two lost fumbles were strip sacks, and while some blame can be put on the shoulders of the offensive line in that regard, Stroud also held onto the ball too long at times, which allowed the Pittsburgh pass rush to get home. He also appeared to have some miscommunication with his center, which also saw the ball hit the turf. Stroud was fortunate to have his defense bail him out, as they allowed just three points on his three turnovers. If he gives the ball away this time around with MVP contender Drake Maye on the other side, it could be a different story. Has New England's defense actually leveled up?One of the big takeaways from New England's win over the Chargers was just how dominant their defense was. While we've come to expect that kind of brilliance from Houston's unit, the Patriots' defense seemed to level up against Los Angeles. They held Justin Herbert and Co. to just three points, sacked him six times, and allowed just one conversion on 10 third-down attempts. While that's outstanding, it is fair to wonder just how much of that domination was due to the Patriots' evolving play and how much to the Chargers not being ready for the moment. After all, the L.A. offensive line had been in shambles all season after losing both star tackles, Rashawn Slater and Joe Alt, and Herbert was one of the most pressured quarterbacks in the league during the regular season. However, if this is a sign that this New England defense has gone up a level, it raises their ceiling remarkably. \nX factor\nWhile there's no official word yet, it does appear as if the Texans will be without their No. 1 pass-catching weapon in Nico Collins, after he left Monday's matchup due to a concussion. That's a big blow to the offense, but Houston did see veteran Christian Kirk step up in that playoff win over Pittsburgh, catching eight of his nine targets on the night for 144 yards and a touchdown. They'll need another performance like that for the Texans to confidently move the ball with any regularity. If he cannot, and no other pass catcher steps up, that'll once again see Stroud hold onto the ball far longer than he should and open the door for New England's pass rushers to take him down throughout the game. Texans vs. Patriots prediction, pick\nHouston's pass rush is a real challenge for the Patriots' offensive line. However, I think New England's defense could prove just as big an adversary for C.J. Stroud, especially if he does not have Collins. It looks like the Patriots will have star corner Christian Gonzalez for this matchup after he also suffered a concussion on Sunday, further emboldening the idea that this New England unit can shut down the Texans' offense and potentially create a turnover or two. If Stroud coughs the football up, the Patriots should be able to capitalize more than Pittsburgh was able to a week ago. On top of that, this is also a tough spot for the Texans from a scheduling perspective. They just had to play on the road in Pittsburgh, fly back to Houston, and then jump back on the plane to head to New England, all on the short week. That's a lot of adversity to overcome, so I see the Patriots advancing to the AFC Championship. \nPrediction: Patriots 24, Texans 20 | Pick: Patriots -3\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Federal prosecutors charged 26 people on Thursday, including several former and current college basketball players, in an alleged point-shaving scheme, according to an indictment obtained by CBS News. The indictment states that more than 39 college basketball players on at least 17 Division I teams \"fixed and attempted to fix\" over 29 games.  Seventeen former college basketball players are listed as defendants in the indictment. Fifteen of those players participated in the 2023-24 or 2024-25 seasons. A few have also played this season. Four of the current players listed in the indictment are: Kennesaw State's Simeon Cottle, the preseason Conference USA Player of the Year, who was averaging 20.2 points; Delaware State's Camian Shell (8.0 ppg); Eastern Michigan's Carlos Hart (13.1 ppg); and Texas Southern's Oumar Koureissi (4.9 ppg).  The list of schools with current or former players alleged to have participated in game-fixing: Abilene Christian, Alabama State, Buffalo, Coppin State, DePaul, Eastern Michigan, Fordham, Kennesaw State, La Salle, New Orleans, Nicholls, North Carolina A&T, Northwestern State, Robert Morris, Saint Louis, Southern Miss and Tulane. \nBeyond that, investigators also identified Western Michigan, Butler, St. John's, East Carolina, McNeese State, Duquesne, La Salle, Kent State, Ohio, Georgetown as schools affected by the alleged scheme which involved millions of dollars illegally wagered on dozens of mid-major games that past two seasons.  Even with a lack of high-major schools involved and with no big-name players attached, the scope of the scheme, if proven accurate, would rank among the largest gambling conspiracies in the history of college athletics. Two of the primary targets of the investigation are non-athletes, men who built an elaborate plan to get rich illicitly by scheming to fix games far off the mainstream path of college basketball. Shane Hennen and Marves Fairley were purportedly at the center of a conspiracy that includes charges of wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bribery in sports. \nAccording to the indictment, the scheme began in September 2022 with illegal gambling activity tied to professional basketball in China. Former LSU player Antonio Blakeney was a star for the Chinese Basketball Association's Jiangsu Dragons and, per investigators, fixed games overseas. From there, Blakeney worked with Hennen, Fairley and other co-conspirators to recruit a litany of mid- and/or low-major college basketball players to fix the outcomes of first-half totals and overall games. Players at smalls schools (who were not making big money in NIL deals) allegedly accepted deals of $10,000 to $30,000 to intentionally compromise games for sports betting purposes, according to the FBI.Blakeney, a former five-start prospect in the class of 2015, has been separately charged in an undisclosed case. \n\"We allege an extensive international criminal conspiracy of NCAA players, alumni and professional bettors who fixed gains across the country and poisoned the American spirit of competition for monetary gain,\"U.S. Attorney David Metcalf said Thursday morning at a press conference in Philadelphia.\n        \n            \n                From five-star to federal case: How Antonio Blakeney's career veered off course\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe betting amounts are eye-opening: $458,000 for NC A&T to lose against Towson; $424,000 on Kent State to cover a first-half spread vs. Buffalo; $275,000 for Southern Miss to not cover a first-half spread against South Alabama; $256,000 for Robert Morris to flop in the first half of a game against Northern Kentucky.These are massive numbers on afterthought games. Sportsbooks can track all betting patterns, and even with a variety of people in a criminal conspiracy betting on a game in somewhat-smaller amounts, the collective action on a single mid-major contest will be immediately flagged by either the sportsbooks themselves or third-party watchdogs that monitor for integrity purposes.\n\"This was a massive scheme that enveloped the world of college basketball,\" Metcalf said, adding, \"this was a significant and rampant corruption of college athletics.\" The FBI's indictment cut at the heart of the case: \"In placing these wagers on games they had fixed, the defendants defrauded sportsbooks, as well as individual sports bettors, who were all unaware that the defendants had corruptly manipulated the outcome of these games that should have been decided fairly, based on genuine competition and the best efforts of the players.\"A lot of the schools and players tagged in the case did not catch the NCAA by surprise. The organization has been able to work independently of the FBI's probe, the existence of which was known for more than a year. Shortly after Thursday's news broke, NCAA president Charlie Baker had a statement prepared.\n\"Protecting competition integrity is of the utmost importance for the NCAA,\" Baker said. \"We are thankful for law enforcement agencies working to detect and combat integrity issues and match manipulation in college sports. The pattern of college basketball game integrity conduct revealed by law enforcement today is not entirely new information to the NCAA. \"The NCAA's work is far from done, though. Every player whom the NCAA has found guilty of altering their stats intentionally to affect game lines and/our outcomes has been banned for life. The count heading into Thursday was 11; the number will rise in light of the FBI unsealing its case. The NCAA's enforcement staff has looked into \"approximately 40 student-athletes from 20 schools over the past year,\" per Baker. Most of the NCAA's cases overlap with the FBI's.\"The Association has and will continue to aggressively pursue sports betting violations in college athletics using a layered integrity monitoring program that covers over 22,000 contests, but we still need the remaining states, regulators and gaming companies to eliminate threats to integrity — such as collegiate prop bets — to better protect athletes and leagues from integrity risks and predatory bettors,\" Baker said. \"We also will continue to cooperate fully with law enforcement. We urge all student-athletes to make well-informed choices to avoid jeopardizing the game and their eligibility.\"  \nFormer New Orleans players Cedquavious Hunter and Dyquavian Short are among the defendants in Thursday's indictment. Hunter and Short were both sanctioned by the NCAA in November after the Committee on Infractions found that they were involved in illegal gambling and/or game-manipulation activity.The NCAA's investigation also included former Arizona State star BJ Freeman, New Orleans' Jamond Vincent and Mississippi Valley State's Donovan Sanders and Alvin Stredic. The NCAA stated at the time that its six cases were unconnected.  Thursday's news is the latest bad headline tied to alleged illegal gambling in American sports. Hennen and Fairley are central actors in both this case and the October shocker that included the arrests of 30 people in relation to an illegal poker ring and alleged illegal gambling on the NBA. That case most notably included charges against former NBA player Terry Rozier and former NBA player/Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups. That investigation was entirely separate from the high-profile story into former NBA player Jontay Porter, who allegedly manipulated his own stats for monetary gain and was quickly banned from the league.\nCross-referencing with the indictment's detailed allegations, here are the 29 games that the FBI believes were tampered with in men's D-I college basketball:Feb. 17, 2024: Nicholls-McNeese StateFeb. 18, 2024: Tulane-East CarolinaFeb. 19, 2024: Northwestern State-Texas A&M Corpus-Christi Feb. 20, 2024: Saint Louis-DuquesneFeb. 21, 2024: La Salle-St. BonaventureFeb. 23, 2024: Fordham-DuquesneFeb. 24, 2024: DePaul-GeorgetownFeb. 24, 2024: Buffalo-Western MichiganFeb. 27, 2024: Buffalo-Kent StateFeb. 28, 2024: Robert Morris-Northern KentuckyFeb. 28, 2024: Southern Miss-South AlabamaFeb. 29, 2024: North Carolina A&T-TowsonMarch 1, 2024: Southern Miss-LouisianaMarch 1, 2024: Kennesaw State-QueensMarch 2, 2024: Tulane-FAUMarch 2, 2024: DePaul-ButlerMarch 4, 2024: Coppin State-South Carolina StateMarch 5, 2024: Buffalo-OhioMarch 5, 2024: DePaul-St. John'sMarch 5, 2024: Robert Morris-Purdue Fort WayneMarch 11, 2024: New Orleans-LamarMarch 19, 2024: Abilene Christian-Texas A&M Corpus-ChristiMarch 20, 2024: Abilene Christian-Tarleton StateNov. 21, 2024: Eastern Michigan-OaklandDec. 5, 2024: Alabama State-Southern MissDec. 21, 2024: Eastern Michigan-Wright StateDec. 28, 2024: New Orleans-McNeeseDec. 30, 2024: New Orleans-VanderbiltJan. 11, 2025: New Orleans-Southeastern Louisiana\n            ",

It's his second stint leading the Falcons. He previously coached the program from 2000-04 and has a 97-183 overall record as the Air Force coach. \nScott also spent three seasons coaching Princeton (2000-03) before nine at Denver (2007-16). From there, he was an assistant at Holy Cross and Georgia before returning to Air Force. In all, Scott has a 281-360 record as a Division I head coach. \n            \n    ",

Saturday, they go for their second in as many weeks as they visit the AFC's No. 1 seed, the Denver Broncos, in the divisional round.Allen was tremendous in Buffalo's 27-24 wild card round win over the Jacksonville Jaguars, completing 28 of 35 passes (80%) for 273 yards and a touchdown and running for two touchdowns -- including the game winner with 1:04 left -- as well. It was the first fourth-quarter comeback win of his playoff career.Immediately after Allen's final score, Tre'Davious White deflected a Trevor Lawrence pass, and Cole Bishop caught the redirect for the game-clinching interception. Shaq Thompson also intercepted Lawrence, and the Bills won despite allowing 154 rushing yards on 6.7 yards per carry.That's been an Achilles heel for Buffalo all season long -- only the Cincinnati Bengals and the New York Giants allowed a higher yards per carry -- but it's unclear how much the Broncos can take advantage. Over the second half of the season, Denver averaged just 3.8 yards per carry, 27th in the NFL.\n\n        \n            \n                NFL divisional round odds, predictions, expert picks: Can Bills pull off upset of Broncos?\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThat could mean it's Bo Nix's chance to shine in a heavily anticipated quarterback matchup. Nix had some ups and downs in his second season, but he was clutch over and over again, leading an NFL-best seven game-winning drives. He can get it done with his arm and his legs -- 356 rushing yards and five touchdowns on the ground -- and he had an NFL-low 3.5% sack rate, helping keep the Denver offense on schedule.Nix and the Broncos as a whole will also be looking for a measure of revenge, too, after the Bills beat them 31-7 in last year's wild card round. Buffalo ran for 210 yards and more than doubled up Denver in time of possession (41:43 to 18:17) and yards (471 to 224).Here's how to watch the game, followed by betting information, keys to the matchup and a pick.\nWhere to watch Broncos vs. Bills liveDate: Saturday, Jan. 18 | Time: 4:30 p.m. ETLocation: Empower Field at Mile High Stadium -- Denver, ColoradoTV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Broncos -1.5, O/U 45.5 (via DraftKings)\nBroncos vs. Bills: Need to knowThe Bills want to run the football. Though Allen is a superstar, the Bills would love to lean on James Cook and the rushing game as much as possible. Cook led the NFL with 1,621 rushing yards this season en route to a second-team All-Pro selection, and in last year's playoff game against the Broncos, he ran 23 times for 120 yards and a touchdown. This year, Buffalo led the entire NFL in rushing success rate and was second in rushing rate. Denver, meanwhile, was very good against the run when looking at the whole season but ranked just 19th in defensive rushing success rate from Weeks 11-17.The Broncos have the defensive talent to throw Allen and the Bills off their game. Whether the Broncos have the best defense in the NFL is up for debate, but they certainly have a strong argument. Led by Nik Bonitto (14 sacks), Denver led the NFL with 68 sacks -- 11 more than any other team. The Broncos are much more than a strong pass rush, though: Their 4.5 yards per play allowed was tops in the NFL, and their 6.1 yards per pass attempt allowed was only behind the Seattle Seahawks. The front features skilled pass rushers in Bonitto, Jonathon Cooper and Zach Allen, and 2024 Defensive Player of the Year Patrick Surtain II heads the secondary. If there's one area Denver's defense doesn't thrive in, it's turnovers: The Broncos' 14 forced turnovers were tied for fourth-fewest in the NFL.Who will Allen throw to? The Bills lost two wide receivers -- Gabe Davis and Tyrell Shavers -- to torn ACLs against Jacksonville, meaning they're down to Khalil Shakir, Keon Coleman and Brandin Cooks in their wide receiver room. Curtis Samuel could be back, but it's still a very thin group, one that has struggled all season. Look for tight ends Dawson Knox and Dalton Kincaid as well as running back Ty Johnson (if healthy) to be heavily involved.History is on the Broncos' side. Denver has been the No. 1 seed nine times. In six of the previous eight instances, it made the Super Bowl.\n        \n            \n                Five key matchups for NFL divisional round: Puka Nacua primed for big day; Patriots rookie faces tough test\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBroncos vs. Bills pick, prediction\nThe Broncos' recent dip in run defense is a legitimate worry. If the Bills can run the ball, they won't back away from it. Even if they can't, as was the case last week, they have Allen to rely upon. On the other side, the Bills have a much better pass defense than run defense, but the Broncos haven't been able to get much going on the ground. When it comes down to it, the Broncos have the best unit in the game -- their defense -- but the Bills have the best player in Allen. I'll go with Allen pulling off another stupendous solo effort. Pick: Bills 23, Broncos 20\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

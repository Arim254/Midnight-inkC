    "body": "\n        Tennessee quarterback Joey Aguilar was denied a preliminary injunction in his eligibility lawsuit against the NCAA by a Knoxville judge, per multiple reports. That denial figures to be a decisive blow to his efforts at playing for the Volunteers in 2026, and serves as a big win for the NCAA which has been on the wrong side of a number of eligibility cases recently. Aguilar hoped to follow in the footsteps of Ole Miss star quarterback Trinidad Chambliss, who received his own temporary injunction from a Mississippi-based chancery court earlier in February. However, Aguilar's case is different than Chambliss', who argued successfully he should gain another year of eligibility due to a health condition he dealt with in 2022. Aguilar's attorneys tried to argue that his junior college years should not count against his NCAA eligibility. Aguilar spent two years at the City College of San Francisco (2019-20) and two years Diablo Valley College (2021-22) before signing with Appalachian State ahead of the 2023 season. That was not a sufficient enough argument to win him the same type of temporary injunction against the NCAA that will allow Chambliss to play another year in Oxford, and barring an unforeseen reversal via a quick appeal, Aguilar will not be back in a Volunteer uniform this fall. \nWhat Aguilar's departure means for Tennessee's QB situationWithout Aguilar under center, Tennessee must replace one of the most productive quarterbacks in the SEC from a season ago. Aguilar completed 67.3% percent of his passes for 3,565 yards and 24 touchdowns in 2025 and was going to be one of the top returning QBs in the SEC in 2026. Because Tennessee didn't land one of the top quarterbacks in the transfer portal -- but not for a lack of trying with Sam Leavitt before LSU locked him down --  the Volunteers will have to turn to unproven youngsters in what becomes one of the most interesting spring quarterback battles in the SEC. The Vols have redshirt freshman George MacIntyre, who played in just two games last season, and true freshman Faizon Brandon, a five-star prospect from the class of 2026 that ranked as the No. 3 player nationally and the No. 3 quarterback, as the most intriguing options, along with Colorado transfer Ryan Staub. MacIntyre threw a total of nine passes in those two appearances last year, completing seven of them for 69 yards. \nHis leg up on Brandon for the starting job won't be on-field experience, but the fact that he's had a year to absorb more of coach Josh Heupel's system. For a Tennessee team hoping to threaten for a College Football Playoff berth in 2026, losing Aguilar puts a tremendous amount of pressure on their young quarterback room to get up to speed quickly -- and on Heupel to make the correct choice between two unproven freshmen. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        With the fantasy basketball stretch run underway, working the waiver wire can be the difference between a playoff push and a missed opportunity. Injuries, trades, and tanking teams are opening up new roles across the league, creating short-term streaming value and potential rest-of-season risers. Players like Jay Huff and Day'Ron Sharpe are seeing increased minutes due to shifting frontcourt situations, while emerging options such as Devin Carter and Tristan Vukcevic offer category-specific upside. Meanwhile, Precious Achiuwa's expanded workload could quietly translate into steady production. Here are the top waiver wire targets to consider as schedules, roles, and rotations begin to stabilize.Jay Huff, Pacers (43% rostered)It's been an up-and-down season for Huff. Efficiency and role haven't been consistent. But there appears to be a trend upward lately, which has upside to continue following the Pacers trading away competition at center in Isaiah Jackson.Huff has played at least 21 minutes in six straight games, averaging 11.3 points and 1.2 3s on 47/26/100 shooting, five rebounds, 1.8 assists, 1.7 blocks, and 1.2 steals (27.9 fantasy points). He might not make sense for fantasy managers in standard leagues who don't need 3s or blocks, but he at least needs to be on the streaming radar in all leagues. In deep formats, I don't think he should be on the wire given what we've seen lately.Day'Ron Sharpe, Nets (33% rostered)Sharpe has started the past two games with Nic Claxton out, providing mixed results due to a competitive game against the Pacers and a blowout loss to the Cavaliers. Still, he was able to total 23 points, 17 rebounds, eight assists, two steals, and two blocks in those 51 minutes.\nSimilar to Huff, Sharpe doesn't qualify as a must-roster player for every team in a standard league. But he will fit the bill for someone who needs rebounds at minimum, and who could also use some extra assists and steals. Over Sharpe's past eight games, he's averaging 11.9 points, nine rebounds, 2.3 assists, and one steal (27.9 fantasy points) in 20.8 minutes. With the Nets playing four games next week, he needs to at least be on streaming radars.Devin Carter, Kings (12% rostered)The Kings are deep in the tank, partially due to legitimate injuries. That has vaulted a few players into fantasy relevance, including Carter. The 23-year-old guard has stepped into a bigger role across the past six games, averaging 14 points on 39.5 percent from the field, 4.5 rebounds, 4.2 assists, and 1.2 steals (28.7 fantasy points) in 26.8 minutes.There's no reason to think Carter won't keep seeing this kind of role. And it's possible there's an expanded role incoming if Russell Westbrook or Malik Monk sit games out. The Kings drafted Carter No. 13 overall in 2024, so the assumption should be they will use this as an opportunity to see what they have in him. Fantasy managers should act accordingly, especially if you need steals and assists.\nTristan Vukcevic, Wizards (12% rostered)Starting center Alex Sarr is expected to be sidelined for at least another week, which should afford Vukcevic continued chances for extended run. He's started four games this season, including Thursday against the Pacers, averaging 12 points and 1.3 3s on 46/28/60 shooting, 4.8 rebounds, 1.3 assists, 1.8 steals, and one block (27.1 fantasy points) in 20.3 minutes when getting the nod.It's hard to trust Vukcevic as a rest-of-season add given that he's on a two-way contract and Sarr could be back sooner than later. Still, he's a strong per-minute player that hardly needs 20 minutes to be worth a short-term pickup. Fantasy managers in all leagues should at least have him on their watchlist, and I wouldn't let him be available right now in deep formats.Precious Achiuwa, Kings (5% rostered)With Domantas Sabonis done for the year and Dylan Cardwell out for a month, Sacramento's frontcourt is in bad shape. Most managers have already picked up Maxime Raynaud, who is a must-roster player. But Precious Achiuwa saw massive run in Thursday's loss to the Magic. In 34 minutes, he produced 14 points, 10 rebounds, one assist, four steals, and two blocks.\nAchiuwa's value has fluctuated for much of the year, but it could stabilize now, given the situation in Sacramento. When Achiuwa plays more than his season average of 20.5 minutes, he averages 11 points, 7.5 rebounds, 1.3 assists, and 1.2 steals (26.9 fantasy points). That's good enough to be worth rostering for some standard league managers. At the very least, he should be scooped up in deep formats to see how this plays out.\n            ",

The Americans rolled to a 6-2 win over Slovakia in the semifinals to set up gold medal matchup against rival Canada.The Americans dictated play from the jump, and Dylan Larkin set the tone with an early goal to give his team the lead. Larkin took a pass from defenseman Zach Werenski and wired a shot past Slovakian goalie Samuel Hlavaj. That was an indicator of what was to come.\nSpeaking of Werenski, that assist on Larkin's goal was the first of three he registered against the Slovakians, bringing his Olympic point total to five.Jack Hughes has been brilliant for Team USA throughout the tournament, and he was at his very best on Friday. Hughes notched a pair of goals -- both in a dominant second period effort -- and the first one was of the highlight reel variety. Hughes moved in from the point, deked Tomas Tatar to the ice and lifted a shot over the shoulder of Hlavaj.The U.S. led 5-0 at the second intermission and parked the bus in the final 20 minutes. Connor Hellebuyck did allow a couple of late goals to Juraj Slafkovsky and Pavol Regenda, the first time he's allowed more than one in a start in Milan, but those only served to make the score a bit more respectable.Team USA will now get its shot to dethrone Canada in a rivalry game with a gold medal on the line.

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 Serie A season is in full swing in Italy. Napoli started the campaign as defending champions after winning the 2024-25 title, their fourth Scudetto ever on the last matchday of the season. Inter and AC Milan will compete with the team coached by Antonio Conte to win the Serie A title, while other teams such as AS Roma, Atalanta, Juventus, Bologna and Como are all in contention for a spot in next season's European tournaments. This week's Serie A slate features some interesting matchups, such as the game between Como and Juventus on Saturday in Turin, but it is injury news that is all the talk heading into the weekend. Here's what to know:Lautaro Martinez injuredInter will have to react after the disappointing 3-1 defeat against Bodo/Glimt in the Champions League as the Nerazzurri are currently leading the Serie A standings with a seven-point margin on AC Milan, which drew 1-1 at San Siro against Como on Wednesday. Cristian Chivu's side will have to deal with the injury of Lautaro Martinez, who was replaced in the second half of the Champions League first leg playoffs. The Argentinian captain underwent a medical examinations that \"revealed a strain to the soleus muscle in his left calf,\" and the player will be reevaluated in the coming weeks, but he's expected to miss at least two weeks of action and will likely miss the key fixture against AC Milan on March 8. This is why the upcoming two Serie A games and the Champions League return leg against Bodo/Glimt will be even more important for Chivu and his team, as the Nerazzurri will need to continue performing even without their best striker on the roster. Players such as Marcus Thuram, Yann Bonny and the young Italian talent Francesco Pio Esposito will be called to make the difference against Lecce on Saturday, the first match Lautaro will definitely miss. How to watch Lecce vs. Inter, oddsDate: Saturday, Feb. 21 | Time: 12 p.m. ETLocation: Stadio Via del Mare -- Lecce Live stream: Paramount+Odds: Lecce +669; Draw +318; Inter -223How to watch Serie A Matchday 26All times U.S./Eastern. \nFriday, Feb. 20Sassuolo vs. Hellas Verona, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)Saturday, Feb. 21Juventus vs. Como, 9 a.m. (Paramount+)Lecce vs. Inter, 12 p.m. (Paramount+)Cagliari vs. Lazio, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)Sunday, Feb. 22Genoa vs. Torino, 6:30 a.m. (Paramount+)Atalanta vs. Napoli, 9 a.m. (Paramount+)AC Milan vs. Parma, 12 p.m. (Paramount+)AS Roma vs. Cremonese, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)\nMonday, Feb. 23Fiorentina vs. Pisa, 12 p.m. (Paramount+)Udinese vs. Bologna, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe Purdue Boilermakers face a gut-check game on Friday night.Ranked No. 1 in the country entering the season, the Boilermakers are coming off a 91-80 loss to the current top-ranked team, Michigan, at home. After jumping out to a 5-0 lead, Purdue was never in the contest, trailing by 20 points at one point.After the loss, Boilermakers coach Matt Painter had a subtle critique for his team. \"You can be preseason No. 1 in the country,\" he said. \"It means nothing.\"And now Purdue (21-5, 11-4 in Big Ten), with its conference title hopes all but dashed, must regroup on Friday when it faces the rival Indiana Hoosiers, a team that beat the Boilermakers earlier this season, at Mackey Arena in West Lafayette, Ind. The Hoosiers (17-9, 8-7) are coming off a loss, 71-51, at No. 8 Illinois. They currently sit on the NCAA Tournament bubble and cannot afford too many more losses if they hope to make the 68-team field.The Boilermakers are 11.5-point favorites on Friday.While Purdue vs. Indiana is the marquee attraction on Friday, there are other options on a sporting landscape that includes nine NBA games and a partial college basketball schedule. Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Friday, Feb. 20. All times Eastern.College basketball best bets, where to watchVCU at No. 18 Saint LouisTime: 7 p.m. | Location: St. Louis | TV: ESPN2 | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Saint Louis -7.5 | Expert: VCU +8.5 (Chip Patterson)\nThe lead in the Atlantic 10 will be on the line when the Saint Louis Billikens and VCU Rams collide at the Chaifetz Arena. The Billikens (24-2, 12-1 in A-10) lead the conference by a half game over the Rams (21-6, 12-2) but are coming off a shocking loss at Rhode Island on Tuesday. Meanwhile, VCU has reeled off 10 straight wins. In the previous matchup between the teams, the Rams led 62-61 with 2:30 remaining in the game before Saint Louis scored the last 10 points of the contest. \"Phil Martelli Jr.'s team is playing well enough to threaten for the road upset,\" Patterson says. The SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every college basketball game 10,000 times, disagrees. It says the Billikens have a 53.0% chance to cover and assigns a C grade to Saint Louis -7.5.Indiana at No. 7 PurdueTime: 8 p.m. | Location: West Lafayette, Ind. | TV: FOX | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Over 149.5 | Expert: Purdue First Half -6 (Chip Patterson)\nDespite the Boilermakers' loss to Michigan on Tuesday, they still have the No. 2-rated offense in the country (129.2 points per 100 possessions, according to KenPom). But the defense struggled against the Wolverines, allowing Michigan to shoot 52.6% from the field and 56.5% on 3-pointers. The SportsLine Projection Model says there's a 71.6% chance the teams combine for 150 points or more and gives a B grade to Over 149.5. Meanwhile, Patterson is expecting to see a motivated Boilermakers team. \"Purdue simply has to come out breathing fire after getting run by Michigan at home on Tuesday night,\" he says.NBA best bets, where to watchMavericks at TimberwolvesTime: 7:30 p.m. | Location: Minneapolis | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Under 239.5\nAs if things aren't already bad enough for the Dallas Mavericks, who have lost nine in a row, rookie sensation Cooper Flagg has been ruled out for Friday's game against the Minnesota Timberwolves with a foot injury that kept him out of the NBA's All-Star events. That's a tough blow considering Flagg is on pace to become just the eighth rookie in league history to average at least 20 points, six rebounds and four assists a game. Meanwhile, the Minnesota Timberwolves are an elite defensive team when at home. They give up just 108.1 points per 100 possessions at the Target Center, which is the third-best defensive rating at home in the league. The SportsLine Projection Model says there's a 57.3% chance the teams combine for 239 points or fewer and assigns a B grade to Under 239.5.Clippers at LakersTime: 10 p.m. | Location: Los Angeles | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Over 226.5\nThe good news for the Los Angeles Lakers: Their big three of LeBron James, Luka Doncic and Austin Reaves are all set to play on Friday against the Los Angeles Clippers. The bad news: James, Doncic and Reaves are all subpar perimeter defenders on big contracts, and that's no way to win a title. The Lakers give up 116.6 points per 100 possessions, which ranks 23rd in the league. Meanwhile, the Clippers are coming off a 115-114 upset of the Nuggets on Thursday night. The SportsLine Projection Model says there's a 64.1% chance the teams combine for 227 points or more and gives a strong A grade to Over 226.5.Looking aheadCollege basketball: No. 4 Arizona at No. 2 HoustonTime: 3 p.m. Saturday | Location: Houston | TV: ABC | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Houston -5.5 | Expert: Houston -3.5 (Thomas Casale)\nSaturday is an enormous day in college basketball, with two massive games, each featuring two top-four teams and national title contenders. In the first game, the Houston Cougars and Arizona Wildcats collide with the lead in the Big 12 on the line and a possible No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament at stake. The Cougars (23-3, 11-2 in Big 12) and Wildcats (24-2, 11-2) enter Saturday's showdown tied for the top spot in the conference. Arizona, however, will be without its No. 2 scorer, Koa Peat (lower leg). That doesn't bode well against Houston, which has the second-best scoring defense in the country (61.6 points per game). \"I like the spot for Houston at home and I think they are the better team,\" Casale says. The SportsLine Projection Model says the Cougars have a 64.0% chance to cover and assigns a B grade to Houston -5.5.No. 1 Michigan vs No. 3 DukeTime: 6:30 p.m. Saturday | Location: Washington, D.C. | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Duke +2.5\nSettle in for college basketball's game of the year: the No. 1 Michigan Wolverines against the No. 3 Duke Blue Devils at Capital One Arena in a showdown that could be a preview of the national championship game. The matchup to watch will be Duke's Cameron Boozer, who's the favorite to win the national player of the year award, against Michigan's army of big men. Led by Boozer, who ranks 14th in the country in rebounds per game (10.0), the Blue Devils rank eighth in the nation in rebound margin (9.8 per game) and have the ability to neutralize the Wolverines' ability to get second shots. The SportsLine Projection Model says there's a 67.0% chance Duke covers and gives a B grade to Blue Devils +2.5.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        We're just a few weeks removed from the 2025 season coming to a close. While the Seattle Seahawks are still basking in the glory of hoisting the Lombardi Trophy after winning Super Bowl LX, the rest of the NFL is preparing to knock them off the pedestal or at least become more competitive in 2026. For some organizations, that includes overhauling or continuing the search for their franchise quarterback, while others are simply building around the signal-caller they have. Then, there's another group. It's the collection of teams that aren't quite thrilled with the quarterback they have in place, but are not totally at the stage of hitting the eject button either. That uneasy middle ground regarding the most important position in the sport is hardly the place any team wants to be, but it's the reality for a handful entering 2026. That creates a ton of pressure on those quarterbacks to put everyone's concerns to rest with a strong season, thus planting their flag as a franchise centerpiece. If not, some hard decisions will then need to be made.Below, we'll highlight five quarterbacks who are currently on the hot seat, albeit with the start of the 2026 campaign still months away.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. C.J. Stroud\nA decision on Stroud's future in Houston could come as early as this offseason, as the former No. 2 overall pick is now extension eligible. At the very least, the Texans will almost certainly pick up his fifth-year option, but Stroud hasn't instilled much confidence in recent seasons. The Ohio State product burst onto the scene with one of the better rookie seasons in recent memory in 2023, but he hasn't followed that up with equal or ascending production. In fact, he's regressed on a couple of fronts. \nC.J. Stroud's career as a starter20232024-2025Passing yards per game273.9218.3TD-INT23-539-20Passer rating100.889.6Over the last two seasons, Stroud's completion percentage is worse than Kirk Cousins over that stretch, his yards per attempt are below Geno Smith's, and his passer rating is below Kyler Murray's. Stroud should be heads and shoulders above those quarterbacks as he establishes himself as one of the brightest young players at the position. Instead, he's going in the other direction. And let's not forget the jarring four-interception game in the divisional round against New England. This is hardly the trajectory a team wants to see when considering making him one of the highest-paid quarterbacks in the league on a contract that'll likely pay him somewhere in the range of $55 million per season. It also makes one wonder if Houston will hold off on giving Stroud any sort of extension this offseason and merely pick up the fifth-year option. If that happens, Stroud will be put further under the microscope in 2026 with the Texans determining if he's truly worth giving a mammoth contract to. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Bryce Young\nYoung is in a somewhat similar position to Stroud as the Panthers are now having to consider giving him the fifth-year option (which they are expected to do), along with potentially inking him to an extension. It's been a topsy-turvy career for Young thus far after being the No. 1 overall pick in 2023. The Alabama product was benched momentarily, but he did just enjoy a solid bounce-back season in 2025. He notched career highs in passing touchdowns, completion percentage, and passing yards per game, while helping Carolina to an NFC South championship. Young also played well in his playoff debut, albeit in a losing effort to the Rams. With that in mind, there should be optimism surrounding Young going into 2026, but he hasn't firmly established himself just yet. As encouraging as 2025 was, Young still completed just 63.6% of his passes and averaged 188.2 passing yards per game for an 87.8 passer rating. That's good, but not exactly great production. If he plateaus or regresses next season, the Panthers will still have major questions surrounding him as their long-term option.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Michael Penix Jr.\nPenix may be given the benefit of the doubt in 2026 because he's recovering from a torn ACL, but the former Washington quarterback hasn't impressed since Atlanta selected him with the eighth overall pick in 2024. He's 4-8 as the starter (3-6 in 2025), and is completing less than 60% of his passes with a mere 85.8 passer rating for his career. Despite having some of the top weaponry in the league in running back Bijan Robinson and wideout Drake London, the Falcons offense under Penix has looked clunky. With a new regime coming aboard with Matt Ryan being hired as the President of Football, Ian Cunningham being added as GM, and Kevin Stefanski installed as head coach, Penix could be on shaky ground. After all, none of those figures drafted him, so they are not as invested in him as the previous decision-makers were. There are also durability questions as he's dealt with several serious injuries dating back to college. YearInjuryGames missed2018Right torn ACL42019Right fractured collarbone42020Right torn ACL32021Left A/C joint separation72025Left torn ACL8When you factor in that injury history alongside the uninspiring play when he has been on the field, it wouldn't be surprising to see the Falcons bring in some competition this offseason, whether that's keeping Kirk Cousins in-house or adding another QB into the mix. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. J.J. McCarthy\nThe Vikings bungled their quarterback situation, and it may have cost them their Super Bowl window. They decided to ride with McCarthy and allow Sam Darnold to depart in free agency last offseason after a 14-3 regular season in 2024. Darnold went on to win a Super Bowl with Seattle, while McCarthy has largely struggled as the starter. That decision was seemingly a driving force in Minnesota firing GM Kwesi Adofo-Mensah. A new GM won't have the same investment in McCarthy as Adofo-Mensah did, so the former first-round pick is truly at a crossroads in 2026. In fact, it wouldn't be surprising if the Vikings, under interim GM Rob Brzezinski, bring in some competition this offseason. Depending on who comes aboard (Mac Jones, Tua Tagovailoa, etc.), McCarthy's job could vanish before we even get to Week 1. In 2025, McCarthy was 6-4 as the starter, completed just 57.6% of his passes, and had more interceptions (12) than touchdowns (11). J.J. McCarthy in 2025StatsNFL rankCompletion percentage58%LastTD-INT11-12Last Passer rating72.6LastHowever, the Michigan product did flash a little bit down the stretch, owning a 4-0 record over his final four games in 2025 with seven total touchdowns and just three turnovers. Is that the tide turning in a positive direction? That remains to be seen, but the Vikings aren't exactly acting like it is as they seem open to an upgrade if one is realistically available to them. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Shedeur Sanders\nSanders ended the 2025 season as Cleveland's starting quarterback, but he has hardly established himself as the set-and-forget figure under center for the organization. Despite the fanfare, the Colorado quarterback wasn't particularly impressive when given his opportunity.

When asked about it during his introductory press conference, Monken told reporters that it's \"still to be determined.\" There's no clear-cut prospect Cleveland could take with the No. 6 overall pick at the 2026 NFL Draft, but the team could (and likely will) look to bring in a veteran to compete for the starting job this offseason. That sets up Sanders to be fighting for his job the moment training camp begins later this summer. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 college football season is still more than six months away, and spring practice hasn't even started. Still, betting lines are already available for eight early-season matchups.With position battles unresolved, depth charts incomplete and inevitable injuries still to come, it's impossible to get a firm read on any team. That hasn't stopped oddsmakers from posting marquee lines -- or bettors from hunting early edges on numbers that could shift dramatically before kickoff.Even for fans who (probably wisely) aren't interested in wagering in February on games scheduled for August and September, the lines offer a snapshot of how oddsmakers currently value each team. There's the straightforward head-to-head comparison -- someone has to be the favorite and someone the underdog.Several of the early matchups are also rematches from last season. Comparing those opening lines to how the 2025 editions played out can reveal whether oddsmakers believe a team improved or regressed during the offseason amid roster turnover.\nAs of now there are eight games with look-ahead lines available at FanDuel Sportsbook, and we wanted to take a quick look at each and what the lines say about those 16 teams. Week 0NC State vs. VirginiaLine: Virgnia -3.5Over/under: 54.5 The first college football game played in Brazil will feature a classic ACC rivalry. Last season, NC State won a wild matchup after Virginia jumped out early, only to watch the Wolfpack surge ahead with a 21-point third quarter.This year, the Cavaliers are 3.5-point favorites on a neutral field -- a nod to the belief in what Beau Pribula could bring to the offense as he replaces Chandler Morris at quarterback, and perhaps a sign of greater confidence in Virginia's defense than NC State's.\nThe Wolfpack will again be led by talented quarterback C.J. Bailey, but the central question is whether they can take a step defensively after finishing 82nd nationally in scoring defense last season.North Carolina at TCULine: TCU -7.5Over/under: 50.5 Oddsmakers don't seem too bullish on Year 2 of the Chapel Bill experiment. After the Tar Heels got boatraced at home by the Horned Frogs in the opener last year, TCU opens as more than a touchdown favorite in Fort Worth for the 2026 matchup. Both teams will be breaking in new quarterbacks. TCU brought in Harvard's Jaden Craig, while UNC nabbed former Wisconsin and Maryland QB Billy Edwards. UNC showed some signs of improvement towards the end of last year after their disastrous start, but it seems oddsmakers are going to need to see some proof before they buy in on a major turnaround in 2026 under Bill Belichick. \nWeek 1Baylor vs. Auburn Line: Auburn -7.5Over/under: 58.5Auburn earned a 38-24 road win in this matchup last season -- a result that foreshadowed Baylor's struggles but proved something of a mirage for a Tigers team that had trouble scoring for much of the year.Both teams will look different when they meet in Atlanta to open the 2026 season, but oddsmakers are clearly bullish on Auburn's trajectory in Year 1 under Alex Golesh on the Plains. Golesh brought several players with him from a strong USF squad, most notably quarterback Byrum Brown, and the expectation is that Auburn's offense will be far more explosive.Baylor counters with a high-profile transfer of its own in former Florida quarterback DJ Lagway, hoping he can help reverse course after a dismal 2025 campaign. If nothing else, oddsmakers anticipate points with new quarterbacks on both sides. Still, the Tigers being a sizable favorite on a neutral field stands out.\nClemson at LSU (-11.5, 51.5)Line: LSU -11.5Over/under: 51.5This was billed as one of the games of the year in 2025, but LSU's 17-10 win at Clemson became the high point of the Tigers' season -- and the beginning of a disastrous campaign for Clemson.Now the spotlight shifts to Baton Rouge, where Lane Kiffin has retooled LSU's roster with the nation's No. 1 transfer portal class, headlined by former Arizona State quarterback Sam Leavitt. Oddsmakers appear to be buying into the idea that Kiffin will open up the offense and quickly turn the Tigers into a contender.Dabo Swinney, meanwhile, enters 2026 on the hot seat. If this matchup follows the script set by the early line, the pressure surrounding the longtime Clemson coach is only likely to intensify.\n11/5: UCLA at Cal (-5.5, 53.5)Line: 5.5 Over/under: 53.5Both UCLA and Cal have the rare combination of new head coaches for 2026 and returning starting quarterbacks. Cal is an early 5.5-point home favorite, which suggests slightly more belief in the Golden Bears' roster in Tosh Lupoi's first season back in Berkeley compared to UCLA under Bob Chesney in Los Angeles.The biggest reason for optimism at Cal is Lupoi's ability to keep quarterback Jaron-Keawe Sagapolutele on the roster after a freshman year that showed considerable upside. UCLA, meanwhile, will have Nico Iamaleava back following an up-and-down season and hopes a new staff can unlock his full potential.Both programs are looking for a jolt, and this game in Berkeley offers an early opportunity to generate some much-needed excitement.\nWisconsin vs. Notre Dame (Sunday)Line: Notre Dame -16.5Over/under: 46.5This game will be played at Lambeau Field and while Wisconsin has hopes of building off a solid close to 2025, they are massive underdogs against a Notre Dame team projected to be a national title contender. C.J. Carr has a year of experience under his belt at quarterback and the Irish are expected to have a stout defense once again under Marcus Freeman. Notre Dame will also spend all year hammering home the message of starting fast after they put themselves in a hole early last year that kept them out of the Playoff. The Badgers hope to climb out of the Big Ten's cellar in 2026 after pledging a big investment into Luke Fickell's program, and they put that to use in the transfer portal with 33 signings, highlighted by Old Dominion QB Colton Joseph. No one expects them to win this game, but if they're competitive and keep this solidly inside this early number, it would breed some optimism in Madison. Week 2Ohio State at Texas Line: Texas -2.5Over/under: 47.5A year ago in the Horseshoe, Ohio State won 14-7 as a 1.5-point favorite. This time, oddsmakers give Arch Manning and Texas a slight edge with the game in Austin, but the line again suggests what amounts to a coin flip.Both teams are expected to contend for a national title, though fans will hope for more fireworks after last season's defensive struggle. It should help that Manning and his counterpart, Julian Sayin, will have a full season as starters, potentially allowing both staffs to open up the playbook.\nDespite the marquee quarterbacks, oddsmakers are not projecting a full-blown shootout with two strong defensive programs involved. Ohio State loses significant defensive talent to the NFL this offseason, making this an early test of how quickly a new unit can come together. History -- and recent recruiting and transfer rankings -- suggest the Buckeyes won't take long to reload.Oklahoma at MichiganLine: Michigan -1.5Over/under: 45.5A year ago, the Sooners were 4.5-point home favorites against the Wolverines and validated that line with a 24-13 win that helped propel Oklahoma to the College Football Playoff.Michigan enters this matchup with a new coach in Kyle Whittingham -- who arrives from Utah. With Bryce Underwood back for his sophomore season, the Wolverines carry lofty expectations as a potential CFP contender in 2026.\nThe total of 45.5 is no surprise given the defensive pedigrees of both coaches and could dip even lower as kickoff approaches. For Oklahoma, the question is whether a healthy John Mateer can make the offense more dynamic than it was late in 2025, or if the Sooners will again need to lean on a dominant defense.Oddsmakers appear to trust Whittingham's ability to elevate Michigan, and lingering concerns about Oklahoma's offense have made the Wolverines a slight favorite in the Big House.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        No. 8 Kansas controls its own destiny in a Big 12 Championship race that is shaping up to be an all-timer. The Jayhawks are 10-3 in conference play, just one game behind Arizona and Houston. Kansas gets to play both of the Big 12's top dawgs in the next eight days, but it can't afford to have any other hiccups starting Saturday against a Cincinnati club that has underwhelmed this year (14-12, 6-7 in Big 12 play) but has shown an ability to play up and beat an Iowa State team that is trending to be a No. 2 seed. Of course, Darryn Peterson's status remains the biggest story. He scored 23 brilliant points in just 19 minutes against Oklahoma State before asking out with another cramping episode. \"I didn't anticipate that tonight at all,\" Kansas coach Bill Self told reporters. \"I thought he was good to go, but obviously, we only got 18 minutes. That's disappointing 'cause he could have had a really good night.\" \n        \n            \n                Kansas' Bill Self gets candid on Darryn Peterson 'checking out': What's right, what's 'false', what's next\n                \n                    Isaac Trotter                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe saga continues with no end in sight. Let's dive into the X's and O's of this Big 12 tilt.   Kansas vs. Cincinnati: Need to know Who gets the Baba Miller assignment? Miller is having the best season of his career, even amidst a miserable 3-point shooting slump. The 6-foot-11 Cincinnati forward is firmly a post-hype sleeper who has blossomed into one of the best mismatch forwards in the Big 12. But Kansas has plenty of options. Flory Bidunga has been Kansas' problem-solver defensively this season. Against BYU, he pivoted to guarding dynamic wing AJ Dybantsa. Against Texas Tech, he got the JT Toppin assignment. But Cincinnati is a bit of a tougher matchup. Do you put Bidunga on 7-foot big man Moustapha Thiam and let freshman Bryson Tiller take a turn on Miller? Tiller has been a pleasant surprise for KU this year and has the frame and athleticism to handle Miller. Or do you let Bidunga, the frontrunner for Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year, try to slow down Miller and trust Tiller to handle the Thiam assignment?  \nThe transition seesaw: When these two defenses get set, they can both be pretty nasty. That raises the stakes of each transition possession. You just have to take advantage because there won't be a ton of clean looks in the halfcourt.  Role players in the spotlight: Kansas needs to get Tre White humming again. The well-traveled wing has been so good for the Jayhawks, but he's lost a bit of his steam lately. Part of that could be the after-effects from dealing with a painful root canal procedure. This could be a get-right spot for White. On paper, he has a tasty individual matchup with Cincinnati's Jalen Celestine, who is mainly on the floor to make 3-pointers, not strap up defensively. A good day for White could tilt the scales here. On the other hand, Cincinnati guard Sencire Harris is one of the best point-of-attack defenders in the sport. When he's on the floor, he will get right up into Melvin Council Jr. or Darryn Peterson. Kansas can't let Harris change the game with his energy. He is a total dawg who ain't afraid of anybody.  Where to watch Kansas vs. Cincinnati live Date: Saturday, Feb. 21| Time: 1 p.m. ET Location: Allen Fieldhouse -- Lawrence, Kansas TV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App Streaming on Paramount+ Premium    Kansas vs. Cincinnati prediction, pick \nKansas has plenty of schematic edges in this one, but Cincinnati could be a touch undervalued here in a game that could be a low-possession affair between two defenses that give each other problems. The double-big lineup of Miller and Thiam is mobile enough to hang with Bidunga and Tiller, and Cincinnati's guards won't give up straight-line drives to Council. Cincinnati will unquestionably flood the paint and force Kansas' low-volume 3-point shooters to bomb away over the top. That's the right strategy against everyone on this Kansas roster, except for Peterson. There's also the lookahead spot to Kansas' enormous Big Monday tilt with No. 4 Houston, and if Peterson misses a good chunk of the second half again — which feels inevitable — the door is open for a backdoor cover.

Italy has played a gracious host over the last two weeks of action with some incredible thrills and dramatic finishes. Now, there are still plenty of gold medals left to be handed out on the last weekend of action.It begins bright and early on Saturday with the Men's Ski Cross competition in Freestyle Skiing. Then, action heads over to the Mixed Team Aerials where the Americans look to add another medal to the robust tally. The American women have a chance to earn a medal inside the ice rink on Saturday when they take on Canada in the Bronze Medal Match in Curling. It would mark the first medal in the competition for the Americans and first for Canada since 2014 after entering the competition as the top ranked team.\nPlus, top American Speed Skater Jordan Stolz looks to add another medal to his incredible run on Saturday when he competes in the Mass Start. Stolz has already earned three medals in Italy, two gold and one silver. A medal of any kind in this final competition would make him the first American since Eric Heiden to win four medals in a single Winter Olympic cycle.\n        \n            \n                2026 Winter Olympics medal count: Keep track of Team USA's quest for gold in Italy\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Milan Cortina Games will run through Sunday, Feb. 22, and in total 119 events will take place with 245 medals handed out to the athletes.

Mayweather announced that he will compete professionally in boxing after an exhibition fight with Mike Tyson in the spring.Mayweather will end his professional boxing retirement nine years after riding off into the sunset with a perfect 50-0 record. On Friday, Mayweather announced his plans to box professionally again after a planned exhibition bout with legendary heavyweight champion Tyson. Mayweather signed an exclusive deal with CSI Sports/FIGHT SPORTS for his upcoming exhibition and professional fights.\"I still have what it takes to set more  records in the sport of boxing,\" Mayweather said in a press release. \"From my upcoming Mike Tyson event to my  next professional fight afterwards, no one will generate a bigger  gate, have a larger global  broadcast audience, and generate more money with each event than my  events.\"CSI Sports said they'd reveal details about event dates, broadcast information and the professional opponent for Mayweather's sanctioned return in the coming weeks. \nLast year, Mayweather and Tyson confirmed plans for an exhibition fight between them. The Ring recently reported the fight would take place on April 25 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; however, CSI Sports has not announced the date, location, or ruleset. Mayweather and Tyson are a combined 107 years old. Mayweather weighed in at 160.7 pounds for his last exhibition fight with John Gotti III. Tyson weighed 228.4 pounds for his exhibition bout with Jake Paul.Mayweather (50-0) retired from pro boxing after defeating former  two-division UFC champion Conor McGregor in 2017. Mayweather has taken  eight exhibition boxing bouts in the time since, most notably a first-round TKO against generational kickboxer Tenshin  Nasukawa and an eight-round affair in a non-scored bout with WWE superstar  Logan Paul. \nTyson (50-7, 2 NC) has boxed three times since retiring in 2004. Two of those were exhibitions: a non-scored bout with Corey Sanders in 2006 and a draw against Roy Jones Jr. in 2020. Last year, Tyson boxed in his first professional fight in two decades against Paul. Tyson lost a lifeless decision against Paul, 30 years his junior. The critically panned fight was a huge commercial success for Netflix.\n            \n",

    "body": "\n        A middleweight title shot could be at stake for the winner of Saturday's UFC Fight Night main event in Houston. Former UFC champion Sean Strickland looks to bounce back against red-hot contender Anthony Hernandez.Strickland (29-7) has a new path to the middleweight title after Khamzat Chiamev became champion. Strickland was unlikely to get a third crack at Dricus du Plessis after two failed attempts. But Chimaev vs. Strickland is a fresh matchup. Between Strickland's No. 3 middleweight ranking and name value, it's feasible he could sneak ahead of the more deserving title challenger Nassourdine Imavov. Strickland has to beat Hernandez before those conversations can start. Oddsmakers think that's a tall task; Strickland disagrees.\"He has been steamrolling guys that I could f---ing write a clinic on,\"  Strickland told CBS Sports' Brian Campbell before the fight. \"So, no, he's not [on my level].\"Sign up for Paramount+ and Watch UFC Fight Night: Strickland vs. Hernandez for no additional fee -- every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with your subscription! Plans start as low as $8.99/month or $89.99/year!\nHernandez (15-2, 1 NC) is ready for his breakout moment after taking the long road through the division. \"Fluffy\" was won eight consecutive fights with six finishes. He's days away from potentially having the third longest middleweight win streak in UFC history. Beating Strickland would be the biggest accomplishment of his career, and puts him on par with Imavov as the most deserving middleweight title challenger. In fact, \"Fluffy\" would arguably have a better case than Imavov, boasting a longer win streak and just as many wins over former UFC champs.\"I think if you beat a former champ, that really makes a statement  because everybody is really good here,\" Hernandez said. \"Someone who has already done that  shit, you go out there and take him out? You are sitting in a really  good place.\"  Bet UFC Fight Night at DraftKings and get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:\nUFC Fight Night also features two perennial contenders looking to protect their places in the pecking order. Geoff Neal (No. 12) battles the tenacious Uros Medic, and Dan Ige (No. 14) tries to snap Melquizael Costa's five-fight win streak. Both veterans approach fight night renewed after overcoming personal health issues. For Neal, a five-year battle with substance abuse. For Ige, eye injuries before the Patricio Pitbull fight. \"I didn't have the energy for anything. I didn't prepare right. The weight cuts were terrible,\" Neal told CBS sports this week. \"There was a point before all that shit happen, I'd run for an hour at a seven mile pace. I'm knocking out eight point six miles in an hour. I'm trying to get back to the old me.\"\"I had trauma to my eyes,\" Ige said. \"My mindset going into that fight was, 'I don't know if I'll ever fight again.' I didn't know what I was dealing with. I didn't want a way out of the fight. I knew if I went to a doctor, they would tell me not to fight. That's my ego and my pride. I've battled with that for a long time. I probably should've addressed it, but I didn't... It's something I've always battled, but I'm getting better with it. I have a better relationship with myself and my thoughts. Things are night and day different.\" \nLet's take a look at the rest of the fight card with the latest odds from DraftKings before getting to a prediction and expert pick on the main event below.UFC Fight Night card, oddsFavoriteUnderdogWeightclassAnthony Hernandez -278Sean Strickland +225MiddleweightGeoff Neal -218Uros Medic +180WelterweightMelquizael Costa -218Dan Ige +180FeatherweightAnte Delija -142Sergehi Spivac +120HeavyweightJacobe Smith -310Josiah Harrell +250WelterweightMichel Pereira -155Zach Reese +130MiddleweightUFC Fight Night viewing informationDate: Feb. 21 | Start time: 8 p.m. ETLocation: Toyota Center -- HoustonStream: Paramount+ (subscribe now for as little as $8.99 per month)PredictionSean Strickland vs. Anthony Hernandez: I'm surprised with how far apart the odds are. Hernandez is taking a meaningful step up in competition against arguably the division's most frustrating defensive fighter. Strickland has elite experience and is uniquely equipped to limit his opponent's offense. Hernandez also has serious gaps in his defensive striking that Strickland can exploit. That being said, I'll side with the rising tide. Hernandez is a menace when he has grappling control and half guard on the ground. Strickland did a fantastic job stuffing du Plessis' takedowns and getting off the mat quickly. \"Fluffy\" lacks DDP's physicality, but makes up for it with tenacious chain wrestling and far better top control. Hernandez will have a tough time taking Strickland down. When he does, he'll make the most of it. Enough to win a close decision against a former champ who can certainly play spoiler. Pick: Hernandez via Split DecisionWho wins Strickland vs. Hernandez, and which UFC best bet of over +500 should you be all over? Visit SportsLine now to get detailed picks and analysis from the advanced model which showed a 6.1% ROI from over 500 fights from 2023-25, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Tua Tagovailoa has spent his entire career with the Miami Dolphins, but after six seasons, it looks like the team is ready to move on, which means Tagovailoa is likely going to be suiting up for someone else in 2026. At this point, the only question is whether Tua is going to get released or traded. Both scenarios would come with some complications for the Dolphins and that's because Tua has $54 million in guaranteed money owed to him for the 2026 season. If the Dolphins cut Tua, they would be stuck with an NFL-record $99.2 million dead cap charge this year. However, they could knock that number down to $67.4 million if they designate him as a post-June 1 cut, a move that would allow them to split the $99.2 million hit over two seasons (they'd also take a $31.8 million dead cap hit in 2027). The best-case scenario for the Dolphins would be to find a potential trade partner. The problem there is that it's highly unlikely that any team is going to be willing to take on Tua's $54 million guaranteed salary for 2026. However, the Dolphins could still try to make a deal happen by agreeing to pay some of that salary. If Miami was willing to pay $24 million, then the acquiring team would only have to pay Tua $30 million in 2026, which is a much more manageable number. So if Tua does leave Miami, where could he end up? Let's take a look at four possible landing spots. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Minnesota VikingsThe Vikings are currently in a nightmare situation at quarterback. They appeared to have their quarterback of the future in 2024 with Sam Darnold, who led them to a 14-3 record. The Vikings could have kept him last year, but instead of signing Darnold to a long-term deal (or even just franchise tagging him), they decided to roll the dice by going all in with J.J. McCarthy and that gamble totally backfired. In his first full year as a starter, McCarthy looked much closer to being a bust than someone who will eventually be the team's future franchise quarterback. Say what you will about Tua, but he's definitely a much more polished quarterback than McCarthy. Although he's had some trouble staying healthy, Tua has been productive when he's on the field and he's been especially good when he's had the right weapons around him and the Vikings have a lot of offensive weapons to work with in Justin Jefferson, Jordan Addison and T.J. Hockenson. Tua might have to compete with McCarthy for the job, but that's likely a competition where he would be feeling pretty confident. And let's not forget, Tua's former offensive coordinator, Frank Smith, is now in Minnesota. Smith worked with Tua for four seasons in Miami and he's now the assistant head coach for the Vikings after being hired this year, so there would be some familiarity there. \nThe biggest question mark here is whether Tua would want to join a team that includes Brian Flores. The Vikings defensive coordinator was Tua's head coach in Miami for two seasons (2020-21) and the two definitely didn't get along. Tua ripped Flores' coaching style back in 2024 and it's not clear if the two sides have mended fences. If they have, then Minnesota seems like an enticing spot for the former fifth overall pick. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Arizona CardinalsKyler Murray has almost certainly played his last down in Arizona, which means the Cardinals will likely be in the market for a quarterback this offseason. Jacoby Brissett, who started 12 games last season, is under contract for 2026, so the Cards do have a safety net, but it would make a lot more sense tor them to bring someone in. New Cardinals coach Mike LaFleur just spent three seasons as the offensive coordinator with the Rams, where he got to work with one of the NFL's top pocket passers in Matthew Stafford. That's not Murray's playing style, but it definitely is what Tua prefers, which why he might be able to fit in with Arizona's new offense. \nThe Cardinals have some solid weapons, including Trey McBride, who's one of the best tight ends in the NFL. They have also have an impressive receiving duo in Marvin Harrison Jr. and Michael Wilson. Tua was at his best in Miami when Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle were both on the field, so the Cardinals know what kind of production he's capable of when he has some weapons around him. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Indianapolis ColtsThe Colts might be the biggest wild card when it comes to the quarterback position this year and that's because it's not clear if Daniel Jones will be ready to play in Week 1. Jones had a strong season in his first-year with Indianapolis, but it came to a painful end in December when he tore his Achilles. That's one of the most brutal injuries in sports and it wouldn't be surprising at all if he had to miss the first few weeks of the 2026 season. As a matter of fact, if you look at the recovery timeline for quarterbacks, it would be a borderline miracle if Jones were to play in Week 1. Aaron Rodgers and Kirk Cousins both tore their Achilles in 2023 and they ended up playing in Week 1 of the following season, but both of those injuries happened early in the season (Cousins' injury came in Week 8 while Rodgers tore his Achilles in Week 1. Jones suffered his injury in Week 14).Not only is Jones' health up in the air, but he's also set to be a free agent, so the Colts have fo figure out what they want to do with him, and that's where Tua would come in. If the Colts decide to re-sign Jones, Tua could sign a one-year deal -- if the Dolphins release him -- and be the QB until Jones is ready to play. A trade could also make sense if the Dolphins are willing to eat a healthy chunk of Tua's $54 million salary for 2026. Tua doesn't have any guaranteed money left after the 2026 season, so he could fill in for Jones for a few weeks, finish out the 2026 season in Indy and then the Colts could release or trade him during the 2027 offseason (Tua will have $3 million of his 2027 salary become guaranteed on March 13, so the Colts would have to deal with that if they acquired him in a trade from Miami). \nOne thing working in Tua's favor is that the Colts have a set up where he could thrive: They have a solid offensive line, they have one of the best running backs in the NFL (Jonathan Taylor), they have a solid receiving group led by Michael Pittman and they have a solid young tight end in Tyler Warren. Tua could put up some big numbers in Indy. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Atlanta FalconsThe Falcons currently have two quarterbacks in Kirk Cousins and Michael Penix Jr., but that won't be the case much longer. The team is expected to release Cousins before the start of free agency, which will leave Penix as the top guy on the depth chart. Penix comes with some serious question marks, though: He just tore his ACL for the third time in his football career and he hasn't proven that he can play consistently good football. Although the Falcons expect him to be ready for Week 1, he's playing for a new coach and a new front office that didn't draft him, so it wouldn't be surprising at all if they brought in some competition for him. Falcons coach Kevin Stefanski has shown that he can win games even if he has to cycle through quarterbacks. He led the Browns to the playoffs during a 2023 season where Cleveland started five different players at quarterback. Stefanski is a smart offensive mind and if he thinks that Tua has more upside than Penix, then he would almost certainly be interested in bringing him to Atlanta. \nBringing in a left-handed QB to compete with a left-handed QB would be a plus for the Falcons because it means that Atlanta wouldn't have to make any huge changes from an offensive standpoint. The man making the decisions in Atlanta's front office, Matt Ryan, was noncommittal when asked if Penix would be the starting QB in 2026. Ryan told CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones that Penix's role will be decided by new head coach Kevin Stefanski. \"Kevin's responsibility is to be the head coach of the football team and he's going to let you know who our starters are and who our starters are not. It's not my place to go in there,\" Ryan said during Super Bowl week. \nSo the QB job will be up to Stefanski, which certainly leaves the door open for Atlanta to bring in a new quarterback. Why several QB-needy teams didn't make this listOne thing you may or may not have noticed about this list is that every team on it plays indoors. If Tua has proven one thing in his career, it's that he struggles when the weather gets cold, so it doesn't make much sense for him to play in a cold-weather city, which is why we don't have the Jets, Steelers or Browns listed here. The final start of Tua's Dolphins' career came in a December loss to the Steelers where the kickoff temperature was 17 degrees. That dropped Tua's career record to 0-6 when the temperature is below 40. If I'm a team in cold-weather city, I don't want Tua, and if I'm Tua, I don't want to play in cold-weather city. For Tua, playing indoors will guarantee that he'll get perfect weather for at least eight games per year. Tua has an 8-4 career record when playing indoors (dome or retractable roof) with his last game coming in Week 8 against the Falcons, a day that saw him throw four touchdown passes in a 34-10 win. \n            ",

Over the course of those two weeks, athletes from 92 countries -- not including Russia or Belarus -- will compete in 16 different sports.At the 2022 Beijing Olympics, the United States finished tied for third in the gold medal count, just behind Norway and Germany. The U.S. brought home nine gold medals, which was tied with China in that category, but the Americans finished fifth in the overall medal count with 25.Team USA has already exceeded its overall medal tally, now at 27, and stands to add to both the overall count and possibly even the gold medal count. A win over Slovakia on Friday would assure the U.S. men's hockey team of some type of medal as it would advance to Sunday's final.On Thursday, figure skater Alysa Liu, 20, became the first American woman to take home a singles gold in 24 years and the U.S. women's hockey team rallied from a 1-0 third period deficit to a 2-1 overtime victory over rival Canada to reach the top of the podium for the first time in eight years. And speedskater Jordan Stolz added to his collection of two previous gold medals with a silver in the men's 1,500 meters.\nNorway will attempt to defend its title as the most awarded country in the Winter Olympics, both from 2022 and all-time. The Norwegians won 16 gold medals and 37 total medals at the Beijing Games four years ago, and they possess a large edge in the all-time medal count. Entering these Games, Norway had won 148 gold medals and 406 total medals in its 24 appearances at the Winter Olympics. The Americans are a distant second with 330 total medals.Russian and Belarusian athletes are permitted to compete, but only as individuals under a neutral flag. They'll be classified as \"Individual Neutral Athletes,\" and their medals won't factor into the overall count. Russian and Belarusian teams are still banned from competing the Olympics.\nKeep track of the live medal count over the next couple weeks as the United States looks to fill up its trophy case while competing across Northern Italy.

    "body": "\n        One of the top events on the PGA Tour tees off on Thursday as the 2026 WM Phoenix Open unfolds at TPC Scottsdale (Stadium Course). Known for its raucous crowds, the WM Phoenix Open usually draws a great field, and this year is no exception. Scottie Scheffler, Xander Schauffele and Hideki Matsuyama are among the players teeing it up. They'll be joined by Brooks Koepka, who is playing his second event since rejoining the PGA Tour last week at the Farmers Insurance Open. The first tee times come at 9:20 a.m. ET on Thursday.The latest 2026 WM Phoenix Open odds list Scheffler as the +220 favorite (risk $100 to win $220), followed by Schauffele at +1900. Hideki Matsuyama and Cameron Young are both +2200. Other past major winners in the field include J.J. Spaun (+3300), Koepka (+3300), Collin Morikawa (+4000), Matt Fitzpatrick (+4000) and Jordan Spieth (+5000). Before locking in any 2026 WM Phoenix Open picks, or making any PGA DFS picks on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, simulated every PGA Tour event 10,000 times and reveals golf betting picks that have a history of being extremely profitable. This same model has also nailed a whopping 16 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- as well as this year's PGA Championship and Open Championship. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting sites. \nNew users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Now that the 2026 WM Phoenix Open field is locked in, the model simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard. 2026 WM Phoenix Open predictions One major surprise the model is calling for at the WM Phoenix Open 2026: Si Woo Kim, who is one of the favorites, stumbles and falls outside the top 5. He's a golfer to fade this week. The 30-year-old is off to a fast start this season, finishing T11 at the Sony Open, T6 at The American Express and T2 at the Farmers Insurance Open. This event has been a real struggle for him, however, as he's missed three of thee past five WM Phoenix Open cuts and hasn't finished better than 50th since 2022. See who else to fade here. \nAnother surprise: The model is extremely high on Ben Griffin this week. He has only played this event twice, but he made the cut both times and finished 36th last year and 28th in 2024. Both times he shot above 70 in the first round, but rallied over the weekend, so if he can get off to a fast start at TPC Scottsdale this week, he'll have a chance to be in the mix on Sunday. See who else to pick here. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $200 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:How to make 2026 WM Phoenix Open picksThe model is also targeting three other longshots of +3000 or longer as top-10 contenders. You can only see the model's picks here. \nWho will win the 2026 WM Phoenix Open, and which longshots will stun the golfing world?

The Spurs will host the Thunder at 9:30 p.m. ET, as San Antonio tries to build on its 3-1 lead in the season series. However, Oklahoma City picked up a win in the most recent meeting and is a 1.5-point road favorite in the Wednesday NBA odds at bet365. SportsLine's proven computer model is backing the Thunder to cover the spread, and it has also revealed a best bet for Celtics vs. Rockets.

Bet it at bet365 here:Celtics (+5.5) vs. Rockets (-110)\nBoston extended its winning streak to three games with a 110-100 win at Dallas on Tuesday, as Jaylen Brown had 33 points and 11 rebounds. Brown was named the Eastern Conference Player of the Month in January, and he is averaging 29.5 points per game this season. The Celtics cruised to blowout wins over the Kings and Bucks in their previous two games, while the Rockets have failed to cover the spread in four of their last five games. Boston has won eight of the last 11 meetings between these teams, and it has covered the spread in 14 of its last 19 road games. SportsLine's model has the Celtics winning outright and covering the spread in 67% of simulations. Back the Celtics at bet365 here:Thunder (-1.5) vs. Spurs (-110)Oklahoma City has the best record in the NBA and can extend its lead over San Antonio atop the Western Conference standings on Wednesday night. The Thunder lost their first three games of the season to the Spurs, but they notched a 119-98 win on Jan. 13. They cruised to a 128-92 win over Orlando on Tuesday, holding the Magic to 38.2% shooting overall. The Spurs have only covered the spread twice in their last seven games against Western Conference opponents, and the model has Oklahoma City covering 60% of the time on Wednesday night. Back the Thunder at bet365 here:Ty Jerome Over 20.5 points + assists (-110)\"The Grizzlies traded Jaren Jackson Jr. to the Jazz on Tuesday. The main haul in the trade was draft picks, so they are going to have a void in the scoring department moving forward,\" SportsLine expert Mike Barner said. \"The players they did acquire might not be available yet, which would leave the Grizzlies even more shorthanded. Although Ty Jerome has played limited minutes since returning from injury, he combined for at least 26 points and assists in both games. He could get a few extra minutes against a Kings team that has the third-worst defensive rating in the league, so this over is appealing.\" Back Jerome at bet365 here:\nLooking for more NBA betting picks?You've seen the model's best bets for Wednesday.

Anyone following its NBA betting advice at sportsbooks and on betting apps could have seen huge returns.Wednesday best bets at DraftKings SportsbookThunder (-1.5) vs. SpursCeltics (+5.5) vs. RocketsGeorgia Southern (-192) to defeat Texas StateCombining the three picks into a Wednesday parlay at DraftKings would result in a payout of +459 (risk $100 to win $459). Bet it at DraftKings here: (Odds subject to change)\nThunder (-1.5) vs. Spurs (-108)The Thunder are coming off a dominant 128-92 home victory against the Magic on Tuesday to improve to 3-1 over their last four games before heading to San Antonio. The Thunder have the NBA's best record at 40-11 and lead the league in a bevy of categories, including scoring offense (120.5 ppg) and scoring defense (107.7 ppg). However, the Spurs have given the Thunder three of their 11 losses this season. That storyline was one the Thunder squashed in their last meeting, though, resulting in a 119-98 Thunder win in January. It's hard to debate that the Thunder are the best team in the league, and with the chance to play the reigning NBA champions to simply win by two points to cash a winning bet, the model sees strong value in OKC. The model projects the Thunder to cover in 60% of simulations. Bet the Thunder to cover at DraftKings here:Celtics (+5.5) vs. Rockets (-110)The Celtics are coming off a 110-100 win over the Mavericks on Tuesday as their Texas back-to-back takes them to Houston on Wednesday. Boston has won three straight games and four of their last five contests to improve to 32-18 on the season. They've also won four of their last six on the road, and the Celtics are 6-3 against the spread as a road underdog this season. They are 9-5 ATS as the underdog, and 5-3 ATS in the second half of a back-to-back. Meanwhile, the Rockets are 8-13 ATS at home this season, including 8-12 ATS as the home favorite. Houston is 1-4 ATS over its last four home games. These trends strongly back the Celtics, as do the model's projections, with the Celtics covering in 67% of simulations. Bet the Celtics to cover at DraftKings here:Georgia Southern (-192) to defeat Texas State\"KenPom ranks Georgia Southern eight spots higher for this Sun Belt matchup,\" SportsLine expert Matt Severance said. \"The hosts are 6-5 in the league, and Texas State is 6-6. The Eagles' best player? That would be graduate transfer guard Spudd Webb (16.2 ppg), apparently not related to the former dunk king. At home this season, Georgia Southern is 8-3 while averaging 85.6 ppg and outscoring foes by more than 14. TSU has won back-to-back games, but those were at home. It has a single road win, coming at truly dreadful UL Monroe and even that was close. When playing Georgia Southern on the road, the Bobcats are 1-7 all-time.\" Bet Georgia Southern to win at DraftKings here:\nWant more NBA and college basketball on Wednesday?You've seen some of the model's Wednesday best bets.

    "body": "\n        Gavin McKenna, a star forward for the Penn State hockey team who is widely considered the top prospect for the 2026 NHL Draft, is facing a felony charge following an alleged incident at a bar in State College, Pennsylvania, on Saturday night, Onward State reports. According to a court filing, McKenna is awaiting a preliminary hearing after being charged with felony aggravated assault and misdemeanor simple assault, as well as summary counts of harassment and disorderly conduct. The Felony I charge is defined as \"attempts to cause serious bodily injury or causes injury with extreme indifference.\"According to Onward State, McKenna and other members of Penn State's hockey team met at Doggie's Pub with friends and family after Saturday's game against Michigan State at Beaver Stadium before the alleged assault occurred. McKenna is accused of assaulting an individual, who reportedly suffered a broken jaw in the incident.Penn State, in a statement, said it is aware of the charges.\n\"We are aware that charges have been filed; however, as this is an ongoing legal matter, we will not have any further comment,\" the statement said.McKenna, an 18-year-old freshman from Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada, has 32 points -- 11 goals and 21 assists -- in 24 games this season for the Nittany Lions. McKenna, touted before his arrival at Penn State as a potential generational prospect, had a goal and had two assists on Saturday. An NCAA rule change allowed junior hockey players from the Ontario Hockey League, Western Hockey League and Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League to play Division I hockey. In the past, junior hockey players were considered professionals and therefore weren't allowed to play in the NCAA, but the change allowed a prospect of McKenna's caliber to go through the college recruiting process in the U.S.\nAs a 17-year-old, McKenna put together a sensational season for the Medicine Hat Tigers in the Western Hockey League in 2024-25. He posted 129 points (41 goals, 88 assists) in 56 games while also producing 38 points (nine goals, 29 assists) in 16 playoff games as Medicine Hat won the WHL Championship. McKenna, who recorded a 54-game point streak, ranked second in the WHL in points and fifth in goals while leading the league in assists.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Vinicius Oliveira wants all the smoke. Oliveira headlines UFC Fight Night on Saturday against Mario Bautista, but his ambitions are set higher in the division. He claims UFC's top bantamweights, including Umar Nurmagomedov, are running scared from him.Bantamweight is one of the most competitive divisions in the sport. Heading into his fifth UFC fight, Oliveira is already ranked at 135 pounds and main eventing a UFC card. The Brazilian, not content with his spot in the pecking order, is calling out the shark-infested top five. His prime target is fighter at No. 2.\"I can ask for Umar [Nurmagomedov] my whole life, and he'll run away,\" Oliveira told CBS Sports ahead of Saturday's main event against Mario Bautista, streaming exclusively on Paramount+. \"He'll run away from me like a demon runs away from a cross.\"Sign up for Paramount+ and watch UFC Fight Night live on Saturday night for no additional fee -- every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with the price of your subscription! Plans start as low as $8.99/month or $89.99/year!Oliveira understands why the top bantamweights might not fancy fighting him. There's little upside for highly ranked contenders to jeopardize their standing against a clearly dangerous, but somewhat unproven, contender. All of the bantamweight top stars are on Oliveira's hit list, but he's particularly fixated on Khabib Nurmagomedov's cousin.\n\"He's a smart guy. He's not crazy. He has sense. If I were Umar, I'd run away from myself, too,\" Oliveira said. \"He has many things to lose by fighting me. If he fights me, he'll lose to a guy that's ranked No. 9. He'll bring shame to his country. I think all the Nurmagomedovs will put him away like, 'You're not part of our family because you lost to 'Lok Dog.'\" Oliveira (No. 11) can close the distance between him and his targets by beating Bautista (No. 9) in Las Vegas. Another bantamweight in his purview is former champion Merab Dvalishvili. Oliveira and Dvalishvili recently crossed paths outside of the Octagon. Oliveira claims Dvalishvili confessed to not wanting to fight him during their friendly chat.\"He told me he didn't want to fight me,\" Oliveira alleged. \"He came to me and said, 'Man, I don't want to face you.' I started laughing because I want to face him. I want to prove to myself that I can put him on the ground. That my fuel is really good like his. Fans think that I don't have fuel for five rounds. I can.\"\n\n\nDvalishvili's stamina is a statistical anomaly. His endless endurance is his greatest attribute. How will Oliveira match that? With his heart, mind and hunger. It's not a promising answer, but fits Oliveira's ethos. He's a wild man: fighting with his hands down and calling out the biggest names. With a premium seemingly placed on exciting, charismatic fighters, a showcase win on Saturday could rapidly progress Oliveira towards his desired fights.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- As everyone knows, it's not cheap to attend a Super Bowl. If you want to attend this year's game between the Seahawks and Patriots, it's going to cost you at least $4,600, which is currently the going rate for the cheapest ticket on the secondary market. If you're hoping to get a ticket at face value, you should probably just give up now, because that's not going to happen. Although $4,600 is certainly a large chunk of change, it's just a small drop in the bucket for some people. For some fans, money is no object and for those fans, I decided to go on a mission for you this week: I looked up the most expensive ticket on Stubhub and then I went to sit in the seat so you we could all get an idea of what it's like to sit in the most expensive seat at the Super Bowl. \n        \n            \n                Super Bowl sneak peek: Here's the wildest food that Seahawks and Patriots fans will eat at Levi's Stadium\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAs for Wednesday, the best seat on Stubhub is in Row 1 of section C114 behind Seattle's bench and if you want to sit there, it will cost you $30,751 per ticket. This is the most expensive ticket on Stubhub.  \n                                                                    Stubhub\n                                                            Basically, you could buy a car or you could attend the Super Bowl. You know what? Forget the car, we're going to the Super Bowl. So how close to the field are you if you buy this ticket? Let's check it out. \nHere's what a $30,000 ticket will buy you at the Super Bowl.  \n                                                                    John Breech/CBS Sports\n                                                            Now that you know where the seat is, let's check out the view. The seats in section C114 have a view on the 40-yard line, and although I couldn't get get directly to that seat, I found my way to Row 1 of section C116, which is in a similar spot, but on the opposite 40-yard line. And here it is, here's your $30,000 view: \nWhen I posted the tweet, I estimated how much a front row ticket would cost in this section and I was $10,000 off, so please never ask me to appraise your house. It will not work out well for anyone involved. There are currently two tickets on sale on the secondary market for more than $25,000 each and the other one is in Row 2 of Section 114. \nIt's a huge asking price, but for fans who want to be part of history at any cost, it can certainly be worth it. The Seahawks are in the Super Bowl for the first time in 11 years and when you've waited a decade to get back to the big game, it can be easier to justify this kind of purchase. For the Patriots, yes, they do have six Super Bowl titles, but it's been seven years since their last trip to the big game. And let's not forget, there are a lot of rich people in Silicon Valley, so it's certainly possible that someone ends up forking over $30,000 for these tickets, and if they do, you'll know exactly what view they have at the game. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        One of the beauties of the NFL is that a champion can come from anywhere. Entering this season, the New England Patriots were hoping a new coach and a free agency splurge would help improve things for Drake Maye, the No. 2 pick in 2024 who had shown plenty of promising signs but overall struggled amid dismal surroundings in his rookie year. Mike Vrabel seemed like he'd raise the floor -- he had been so good for the Tennessee Titans after all -- but teams coming off 4-13 seasons don't just all of a sudden become Super Bowl contenders. In fact, no team with 13 or more losses one season had made the Super Bowl the loss. A 20-13 Week 1 loss to the Las Vegas Raiders seemed to confirm the fact that the Patriots still had a ways to go.The Seattle Seahawks, meanwhile, were moving away from one quarterback -- Geno Smith -- and onto another. Sam Darnold came to the Pacific Northwest after a remarkable rejuvenation season with the Minnesota Vikings, but his late-season collapse left many wondering which version was the \"real\" Sam Darnold: the one who threw for over 4,300 yards and 35 touchdowns and won 14 games or the one who took nine sacks in a disastrous wild card performance? The Seahawks lost their opener, 17-13, to the San Francisco 49ers, and there still seemed to be more questions than answers.\n        \n            \n                Prisco's pick for Seahawks vs. Patriots in Super Bowl 2026: Stout Seattle defense shuts down New England\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nNow those Week 1 defeats are long, long, long gone. The Patriots and the Seahawks play for the Lombardi Trophy next week. It's the first Super Bowl matchup of teams with 50-1 (or longer) preseason Super Bowl odds since 1981, and it should be a doozy.Where to watch Super Bowl 2026Date: Sunday, Feb. 8 | Time: 6:30 p.m. ETLocation: Levi's Stadium (Santa Clara, California)Halftime performer: Bad BunnyTV: NBC, streaming on Peacock Follow: CBS Sports AppBetting odds: Seahawks -4.5 | O/U 45.5 (DraftKings Sportsbook)\nSuper Bowl LX prediction\nExpect a bit of a slow start in this game. This is a big, big game, and the atmosphere is unlike anything either quarterback has been in before. On three opening drives this postseason, Maye is 2-for-5 for 13 yards and a sack, and the Patriots have managed exactly one first down. Add in that Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald will have had two weeks to cook up a variety of defensive looks, schemes and pressure packages -- and the same goes for Patriots defensive play caller Zak Kuhr -- and I don't envision either team getting off to a blazing start offensively. It's an overused comparison, but it really is a \"feeling out\" period like in boxing.Keeping the boxing parallels going, this is very much a heavyweight fight. This is the only Super Bowl since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger in which both teams ranked in the top four in scoring offense and scoring defense in the regular season.The Seahawks getting there is one of the biggest reasons Klint Kubiak emerged as one of the hottest coaching candidates in the NFL. Kubiak has worked under his father Gary as well as Kevin Stefanski and Kyle Shanahan, and those influences are all over his offense. Seattle had the second-highest under-center rate this season -- only behind the Los Angeles Rams -- and had the seventh-highest play action dropback rate. That has provided Darnold with lots of quick, easy answers, and it can also help take the burden off the offensive line. It also places a huge burden on opposing linebackers.\nNFL ranks this season on play actionSeahawks offensePatriots defenseYards per attempt1st12thExplosive play rate1st19thPassing success rate8th25thExpect a lot of Jaxon Smith-Njigba in these situations.It's also worth noting the Seahawks' modest improvement running the ball. Over the first nine weeks, Seattle was 31st in rushing success rate. Since then, it is up to 18th. Kenneth Walker III is an explosive runner who can make a game-breaking play out of nothing.But really, it's the other side of the ball in which Seattle has the biggest edge. The Patriots are averaging just 18 points per game in the postseason, the lowest by any team entering the Super Bowl since the 1979 Rams. The Patriots' offensive line has really struggled this postseason, and while it's worth recognizing that's been against many of the league's best, the Seahawks' defense is ... also among the league's best. Nothing is easy about this team. Interior defenders Leonard Williams and Byron Murphy II are disruptive, and there's a host of edge rushers available, too. If Devon Witherspoon isn't the best cornerback in the NFL, he's right up there with anyone, and his high levels of competitiveness and physicality are present across the defense. The Seahawks don't miss tackles, and they don't allow big plays, either. Seattle's 7.4% explosive play rate allowed is the best by any team since the 2012 49ers. Maye has been terrific across the board this year, but this defense takes away his biggest strength -- the big play -- as well as anyone.Seattle also has some smaller edges around the edges, including on special teams. It has the best unit on the field overall (its defense) and the best offensive weapon in Smith-Njigba. Seattle heads home the champion.\nPick: Seahawks 24, Patriots 20MVP: Jaxon Smith-Njigba\n            ",

On Sunday, Feb. 8, the AFC champion New England Patriots will do battle with the NFC champion Seattle Seahawks for the right to raise the Lombardi Trophy.New England advanced to the Super Bowl for the first time since the 2018 season thanks to consecutive victories over the Los Angeles Chargers, Houston Texans and Denver Broncos. The Patriots won a sloppy, snowy AFC title game over a Broncos team starting its backup quarterback, emerging with a 10-7 win thanks to several Denver miscues, some well-timed runs from Drake Maye and an electric performance from a defense that has stepped up in a big way during this playoff run.Seattle is headed back to the Super Bowl for the first time since making it in back-to-back years in 2013 and 2014. The Seahawks earned a first-round bye and then defeated the division rival San Francisco 49ers and Los Angeles Rams in consecutive weeks. They won a thrilling, back-and-forth NFC title game on the strength of a fantastic performance from Sam Darnold, who slayed some demons by throwing for 346 yards and three touchdowns in the 31-27 victory.Which of these two teams will emerge victorious and hoist the Lombardi Trophy? We'll find out soon enough. But in the meantime, here's a look at how you can actually watch the game.\nWhere to watch Super Bowl 2026Date: Sunday, Feb. 8 | Time: 6:30 p.m. ETLocation: Levi's Stadium (Santa Clara, California)TV: NBC, streaming on PeacockHalftime performer: Bad BunnyFollow: CBS Sports App\nFind all of our Super Bowl LX coverage at CBSSports.com right here.\n            \n    ",

After spending years on Matt LaFleur's staff with the Green Bay Packers, Nathaniel Hackett will be hired by Mike LaFleur to be the next offensive coordinator of the Arizona Cardinals, sources tell CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz.From 2019-21, Hackett served as the Packers' offensive coordinator under Matt LaFleur, and he orchestrated one of the most efficient red-zone offenses in the NFL with Aaron Rodgers at the helm. After brief and disastrous stints as the coach of the Denver Broncos and offensive coordinator of the New York Jets, Hackett reunited with the elder LaFleur brother this past season as a defensive analyst with the Packers.That familiarity with the LaFleur family likely played a factor in Hackett landing another offensive coordinator job with the Cardinals. Mike LaFleur has already said he'll call plays in Arizona, so Hackett may take on a role similar to the one he had as the offensive coordinator in Green Bay. In Hackett's first stint with the Packers, the offense never finished worse than 15th in scoring, and the team ranked first in 2020 with 31.8 points per game.That success led to Hackett becoming the Broncos coach in 2022, but he lasted just one season following a 4-11 campaign. From 2023-24, Hackett reunited with Rodgers in New York, but the duo wasn't able to recapture the magic they had in Green Bay. Rodgers missed all but a few snaps of the 2023 season with an Achilles injury, and the Jets averaged just 19.9 points per game in 2024.\nLast fall, Hackett rejoined Matt LaFleur's staff as a defensive analyst to give his perspective as an offensive mind. Last week, it seemed like Hackett was set to join former Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley's staff in Miami as the new Dolphins quarterback coach, but he will get a bigger role with Mike LaFleur and the Cardinals.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Tom Brady says the time is coming for Bill Belichick and Robert Kraft's rightful inductions into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, but joked that news of the New England Patriots duo's snubs ahead of Thursday's class of 2026 reveal has given him pause as an expected first-ballot honoree.After retiring in 2023, Brady is eligible for the Hall of Fame after the mandatory five-year post-playing career period in 2028. Brady, a seven-time Super Bowl champion quarterback and three-time NFL MVP, won six titles with the Patriots and earned his final ring with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Brady won in New England under Belichick's tutelage, but the coach will not be a first ballot Hall of Famer as many expected. Kraft, meanwhile, has been the owner of the Patriots since 1994 and was a first-time finalist as a contributor.\"To me, it's not a matter of … just like Bill, if they're going to get in, but when they're going to get in,\" Brady said Tuesday on The Herd with a laugh. \"They're tremendous at what they've done in the league. Maybe it's not trending so well for ex-Patriots (and) maybe I should be a little concerned here, but at some point, this thing is going to go in everyone's direction the right way.\"Brady snickered a bit when mentioning the wild week it has been for his former New England comrades and didn't seem all that worried about his own Pro Football Hall of Fame stock. Brady owns several NFL passing records and no quarterback accumulated more wins (261) in their career at the position.Baffled by Kraft's snub as he was Belichick, Brady said the owner of the Patriots is worthy of praise due to his attention to detail and dedication to a franchise he has helped lead since after purchasing the team for $172 million in 1994. During Kraft's tenure, the Patriots have captured 11 AFC titles and 22 AFC East divisional crowns. He also helped the building of Gillette Stadium in Foxboro, Massachusetts.\nNew England has a shot at its first Super Bowl crown under Kraft post-Brady on Sunday against the Seattle Seahawks.\"I believe the owner is the chief accountability officer and you hold everyone to a standard and you expect everyone to live up to that,\" Brady said this week. \"Believe me, when the owner is sitting int he team meeting room, the players are sitting up a lot straight. The head coach's message is directed a lot more intently. RKK, his office was at the stadium. He would sit in meeting rooms. He would out there on the practice and at every road game, shaking hands as they walked off the field. There's an importance in Patriots football that RKK does not take lightly.\"Former Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski joked this week at the Super Bowl that he doesn't think anyone associated with New England's dynasty will be enshrined in Canton, Ohio.\n\"I think Tom Brady now is going to be a fourth-ballot Hall of Famer,\" Gronkowski said.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Los Angeles Kings have acquired star winger Artemi Panarin from the New York Rangers in a blockbuster deal, the team announced on Wednesday. The trade speculation around Panarin picked up when the Rangers made him a healthy scratch for trade-related reasons ahead of their Jan. 28 game against the New York Islanders, and the Russian playmaker is now on the move.In exchange for Panarin, the Kings are sending forward prospect and former first-round pick Liam Greentree, plus a conditional third-round pick back to the Rangers. New York will also retain 50% of Panarin's $11.6 million salary as part of the deal. Immediately following the deal, the Kings announced that Panarin had signed a two-year contract extension worth $11 per season. That deal will kick in next year and run through the 2027-28 campaign.Even at 34 years old, Panarin remains one of the NHL's premier wingers. He led the Rangers in both assists (38) and points (57), and he's put up some eye-popping numbers throughout his career. Since entering the league in 2015-16, Panarin ranks fourth in assists (606) and fifth in points (927). Just two seasons ago, Panarin finished fifth in Hart Trophy voting when he tallied 120 points and led the Rangers to the Presidents' Trophy.\n        \n            \n                NHL Power Rankings: Penguins' Sidney Crosby among key players to watch at 2026 Olympics\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nPanarin was in the final year of his contract with the Rangers, which carried a cap hit of just over $11.6 million. That was a major reason the Rangers chose to part ways with Panarin, who would have commanded significant money on his next deal and likely wants another crack at a Stanley Cup. New York, meanwhile, just announced it is entering a \"retool\" phase as it plays out the stretch in a disappointing 2025-26 campaign.\nNow in his 11th NHL season, Panarin began his career after signing a two-year contract with the Chicago Blackhawks straight out of the KHL. In his rookie season, Panarin tallied 30 goals en route to winning the Calder Trophy. He recorded another 30-goal season in Chicago the following season before getting traded to the Columbus Blue Jackets in the summer of 2017.Panarin played just two seasons in Columbus, but he still holds the franchise records for single-season assists (59) and points (87). He was an integral part of the 2018-19 Blue Jackets team that stunned the Presidents' Trophy winner Tampa Bay Lightning with a first-round sweep.Just months after that series, Panarin signed a massive seven-year deal with the Rangers, and he lived up to that contract with 205 goals and 402 assists in 482 games.\nNow let's look at how the Kings and Rangers each made out with this deal, which will surely reverberate throughout the NHL.The tradeKings receive: F Artemi Panarin (50% retained)Rangers receive: Conditional third-round pick, F Liam GreentreeThe gradesLos Angeles KingsIf anyone has followed along with the NHL Power Rankings, they know how much I loathe watching the Kings offense operate. Only four teams score at a lower rate than Los Angeles, and there was a serious need for more firepower at the top of the lineup. Corey Perry, at the spry age of 40, was fourth on the team in goals with 11. That was just two behind Alex Laferriere for third.An elite defensive team, the Kings needed a player of Panarin's caliber if they were going to compete for a Stanley Cup, and now they've got him. Panarin can do a little bit of everything at a high level, from distributing the puck to trigger men on his line to scoring goals himself. Just look at what he's done in the previous two seasons.\nFrom 2023-25, Panarin ranked sixth in goals (86) and eighth in assists (128). Even in a \"down\" year -- both for himself and the Rangers -- Panarin is on an 82-game pace of 29 goals and 59 assists. The Kings, meanwhile, haven't had a player top 80 points since Anze Kopitar totaled 92 in 2017-18. Panarin should also provide an excellent boost to the 29th-ranked Los Angeles power play. Since Panarin entered the league in 2015-16, only five players have put up more points than him (265) on the man advantage.What Kings coach Jim Hiller cannot do in this situation is try to hammer a square peg into a round hole. While Panarin is a much better defender than he gets credit for, Hiller can't eliminate the winger's offensive creativity for the sake of making him play a rigid defensive structure. If anything, Hiller should put Panarin on a line with Quinton Byfield and Adrian Kempe and give them the freedom to take some risks. Byfield can be the retriever, Panarin the facilitator and Kempe the shooter.When it comes to acquisition cost, this was a slam dunk for the Kings. Not only is Panarin a great fit worth a king's ransom, but L.A. didn't even have to mortgage the future, and the team still got him at 50% of his salary. Because of Panarin's no-movement clause, the Kings received an elite forward for a conditional third-round pick and a very good -- though maybe not elite -- prospect. The two-year extension at an AAV of $11 million is also a very easy pill to swallow because it's hard to see Panarin falling off a cliff between now and the end of that deal. This was great work by general manager Ken Holland. Grade: A+\nNew York RangersLook, Rangers general manager Chris Drury was in a tough spot here. Panarin had full control of his destination, and that made it nearly impossible for the Rangers to recoup anything resembling fair value. To be clear, that's not any knock on Panarin. His play prior to the summer of 2019 warranted a big deal with trade protection, and Panarin more than held up his end of the bargain throughout his seven seasons in New York. That's just the risk teams run when they hand out a clause like that.Greentree is easily the most interesting part of this return. The No. 26 overall pick in the 2024 NHL Draft, Greentree is a massive winger who's shown some high-end offensive ability at the junior level. Last season, he ranked third in the OHL with 119 points in 64 games before posting 24 points in 11 playoff games. Greentree has come back to Earth a bit in 2025-26 with 45 points in 34 games, but he was still ranked as the Kings' top prospect by The Athletic.The conditional third-round pick is pretty underwhelming -- even if it can become a second-round pick should the Kings win a playoff round. Even with Panarin holding all the leverage, the Rangers couldn't squeeze a guaranteed first- or second-round pick out of the Kings? It's practically unheard of for a player like Panarin not to command a first-round pick in return, even in these specific circumstances.\nPanarin was New York's best chance to really kickstart a rebuild, but now the team will need to swing a few more deals to really restock the cupboard. They have the players to do that, but it's disappointing the Rangers' biggest superstar couldn't garner a haul on his own. Drury avoids flunking because it's obvious Panarin held firm to his trade protection. Grade: D+\n            ",

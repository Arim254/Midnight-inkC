    "body": "\n        Another day, another cluster of players gathered atop the leaderboard at the 2025 Hero World Challenge. Akshay Bhatia, Hideki Matsuyama, Wyndham Clark, J.J. Spaun and Cameron Young make up the five-headed monster sitting at 10 under midway through the proceedings at Albany Golf Club in the Bahamas.Bhatia bounced back from a bogey on his penultimate hole with a birdie on his last to join the four others on top. This as world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler stumbled slightly with a double bogey on No. 16 due to a wayward drive, dropping from 11 under to 9 under, where he ultimately finished.Scheffler sits in a tie for sixth place alongside Alex Noren and Sepp Straka, while Justin Rose matched an opening 68 with another on Friday to get within two of the lead heading into the weekend.\"I think you can always take good momentum from playing well,\" Scheffler said. \"I wouldn't look too far into it if I didn't have a good week this week, I wouldn't really try to carry that momentum even further. But overall, I feel like it's a good place to kind of see where my game's at and then kind of get ready for the season. It feels like a good warmup event.\"\nMaking the biggest move of the bunch was Scheffler's Ryder Cup teammate, Young, who followed up an opening 70 with a second-round 64 -- the lowest of the 20 players in Round 2. The big-hitting right-hander cruised into his day before finding another gear around the turn, playing Nos. 12-17 in 6 under. If not for a bogey on the last, Young would have fired a sub-30 score on his second nine.\"Made a couple putts late, but it is just one of those courses where, I actually said it to Kyle yesterday, I felt like we played pretty well and comfortably could have shot 4, 5, 6 under, and the scoring made 2 [under] feel kind of bad yesterday,\" Young said. \"But the reality is, day to day out here, you just can have runs of holes where it starts to feel easy, and it's not that different to yesterday. I feel like I played pretty similarly and just made a couple putts down the stretch.\"Young's co-leader, Clark, mentioned he has not putted well through two rounds, and the statistics back up his thoughts as he ranks 16th out of 20 players with the putter in hand. Coincidentally, it is another co-leader in Spaun who ranks last in the field, making the current U.S. Open champion a dangerous proposition moving forward if he figures that club out.\nFor Clark, however, his play all stems from what he does with his full swing. Noting he has started working with a swing coach for the first time in a long time, the three-time PGA Tour winner is making sure to bring only one swing thought to the golf course, leaving the rest for the driving range. And so far, it has been a thought that has worked for him.\"Right now, I just have one swing thought when I play,\" Clark said. \"Like when I'm on the range, I'm thinking of a couple things that I want to do, and then while I'm playing, I'm just thinking about the heel leading the toe coming in so I have an open face. It's just one simple thought, and that's what I'm going with.\"The Year of Young?A breakout star coming out of the Ryder Cup, Young has kept his game in good order over the last two months. The Wyndham Championship winner is among the leaders in the Bahamas, and he has a chance to follow in the footsteps of prior tournament champions, using this event as a springboard for their upcoming year.\nIn 2022, Hovland won this tournament the year before his FedEx Cup victory, while Scheffler used this week to test out a couple of tweaks in his game ahead of his all-time campaigns in 2024 and 2025. Young appears to have a similar mindset on these 72 holes and how valuable they could prove despite their laidback nature.\"It certainly can. I'm kind of not using the week as practice, but I'm using the week to try to build on some things that we've been doing and less so looking at the results just because I haven't played any competition in the last couple months,\" Young said. \"So, it's more just an opportunity to keep building on what we were doing mentally. I don't think the result is necessarily going to dictate the outcome. I think it's going to be more kind of how we go through our process and how we attack the golf course.\"Possible bookendsMatsuyama made noise in the opening week of the year with a record-setting performance at the Sentry en route to victory ... and then was not heard from since. Without a top 10 finish in his PGA Tour season after his victory at Kapalua, the man from Japan aims to bookend his 2025 in style with another win this week.\nWhat has been interesting about Matsuyama's play through 36 holes is the way in which he has gotten the job done. He tops the field in terms of driving accuracy and is inside the top five of putting -- thanks in large part to his Friday showing -- while checking in near the bottom in terms of iron play, where he typically thrives.\"I've been working on everything … we won the first in Hawaii, but didn't play well the rest of the season,\" Matsuyama said. \"So, trying to play well [the] next two days and looking forward to next season.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        WASHINGTON, D.C. -- With the expansion of the World Cup to 48 teams, an increase in squads also means more restrictions on which teams could be drawn together. On the heels of a winter World Cup in 2022 in Qatar, followed by the Euros and both UEFA and Concacaf Nations Leagues taking place, the start of World Cup qualifying was pushed back, leading to the play-in games taking place during March of 2026 after the World Cup draw has already been completed.During the draw on Friday, when Uzbekistan were drawn, groups had to be skipped, causing some confusion. Putting the Asian side into Group K alongside Portugal, Colombia, and the winner of the Intercontinental Playoff 1 (DR Congo/Jamaica/New Caledonia) was necessary. That's because putting them anywhere else would've potentially complicated things, resulting in a situation where there were two teams from the same confederation, which is not permitted, outside of UEFA. Because the playoff winners are not known, avoiding the possibility of having two teams from the same confederation had to be prevented.\nThe standard restrictions were in play that impact any World Cup. However, UEFA is required to have two groups of two of its teams due to the fact that 16 teams will be participating in the tournament from Europe. But looking at the draw mechanics, the playoffs containing teams from multiple different confederations meant that restrictions had to be applied more than once.For the playoff tournament teams, the confederation restrictions were applied to all teams involved in the playoff, which would keep the host nations from drawing a team involved in the FIFA playoff tournament due to Jamaica and Suriname being involved as Concacaf teams. That already created limited chances, but with DR Congo, Jamaica, and New Caledonia representing CAF, Concacaf, and OFC, there was almost no other group that they could go into to further limit options.\nIf playoffs took place before the World Cup draw, that wouldn't be an issue, but in an expanded World Cup, new quirks are created. It's something that may be able to be smoothed out ahead of the 2030 World Cup, but it made for a moment where people didn't know where a team was going. It will take until the March international break for the full World Cup field to be known, but the picture is becoming clearer by the day.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Michael Jordan appeared in court Friday to testify against NASCAR in an antitrust trial. The Basketball Hall of Famer, who co-owns the NASCAR Cup Series team 23XI Racing with driver Denny Hamlin, was called to the witness stand at a North Carolina federal courthouse and spoke out against the racing company's business model.23XI joined Front Row Motorsports to allege that NASCAR committed antitrust violations, and both teams refused to sign the company's new charter agreement which began in the 2025 season. The teams claim that NASCAR's charters are monopolistic and seek changes to the business model.\"Someone had to step forward and challenge the entity,\" Jordan said to the jury. \"I sat in those meetings with longtime owners who were brow-beaten for so many years trying to make change. I was a new person, I wasn't afraid. I felt I could challenge NASCAR as a whole. I felt as far as the sport, it needed to be looked at from a different view.\"The charter system is similar to the franchise model used by other American sports leagues, and it guarantees participation in races and revenue from those races. 23XI and Front Row argue that the revenue model is not viable, though, and they claim that the terms of the charters create a monopolistic environment wherein NASCAR holds exclusivity clauses and tight control over many aspects of the series.While teams asked during negotiations for the renewable charters to become permanent, NASCAR refused. Teams were given just six hours in September 2024 to sign extensions. 23XI and Front Row were the only two to refuse.\n\"One, I didn't think it was economically viable,\" Jordan said, explaining why his team refused to sign. \"Two, it said you could not sue NASCAR. That was an antitrust violation, I felt. Three, they gave us an ultimatum I didn't think was fair to 23XI.\"Jordan and Hamlin formed 23XI in 2020 with Bubba Wallace as their first driver. They secured three full-time entries over the ensuing years, but rather than renewing for the seven-year period, they entered a legal battle with NASCAR.\"I wanted a partnership and permanent charters wasn't even a consideration,\" Jordan said. \"The pillars that the teams wanted, no one on the NASCAR side even negotiated or compromised. They were not even open-minded to welcome those conversations, so this is where we ended up.\"\nIf 23XI and Front Row win the trial, the ramifications for NASCAR could be severe. Not only would it likely owe damages, but it could be forced to significantly change its business model. If the court rules in favor of NASCAR, however, it could seek buyers for the charters that 23XI and Front Row declined to renew without making drastic changes.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The final game of the 2025 college football regular season is the college football game of the year: the No. 1 Ohio State Buckeyes vs. the No. 2 Indiana Hoosiers (12-0) in the Big Ten Championship Game on Saturday.The conference title, the No. 1 seed in the College Football Playoff and possibly the Heisman Trophy will be on the line when these teams collide at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis. One year after winning the CFP national championship, the Buckeyes (12-0) have cruised through the regular season, playing only one game that was decided by fewer than 18 points. Freshman quarterback Julian Sayin leads the country in completion percentage (78.9) and passing efficiency (184.9). Bet college football's championship week, including Ohio State vs. Indiana, at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets. Click here to sign up:Meanwhile, the Hoosiers (12-0) have played just two games decided by one score. Transfer quarterback Fernando Mendoza tops the nation in passing touchdowns (32) and is second in passing efficiency (183.7).Top sportsbooks have made Ohio State a 4-point favorite over Indiana. The line has dropped from -6.5.So what should you make of all that line movement? Is it a market correction or an overreaction? Here's a look at the Buckeyes-Hoosiers point spread, as well as the line movement of four other conference championship games. All times Eastern.No. 4 Texas Tech vs. No. 11 BYU (noon)Open: Texas Tech -11.5Current: Texas Tech -12.5The Big 12 Championship Game at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, is a rematch of a game played earlier this season in Lubbock, which the Red Raiders won 29-7. That final score doesn't truly indicate how dominant Texas Tech was; the Red Raiders settled for five field goals in the game but still led 26-0 midway through the fourth quarter. That certainly is one reason this line has moved in favor of Tech. Also, the Red Raiders (11-1) are undefeated this season when quarterback Behren Morton starts. Meanwhile, BYU (11-1) seems to have gotten a lot of mileage in the rankings out of a three-point win over Utah. If Texas Tech doesn't come in overconfident, the favorite seems to be the right side.Bet championship week college football games at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $150 in bonus bets. Click here:Miami (Ohio) vs. Western Michigan (noon)Open: Western Michigan -2.5Current: Western Michigan -1.5The MAC Championship Game also is a rematch. On Oct. 25, Miami rallied for a 26-17 victory over Western Michigan in Oxford, Ohio, after scoring 17 unanswered points in the fourth quarter. The RedHawks were a 2-point favorite in that game at home, so the Broncos' being a slight favorite at a neutral site (Ford Field in Detroit) seems to make sense. Western Michigan backers shouldn't be scared off by the slight line movement, but Miami supporters may want to consider the money line (+105) instead of the point spread.No. 3 Georgia vs. No. 9 Alabama (4 p.m.)Open: Pick 'em Current: Georgia -2.5Even though the Crimson Tide (10-2) have owned the Bulldogs (11-1) recently, including a 24-21 victory in Athens earlier this season, I was surprised when the SEC Championship Game opened as a pick 'em. Georgia seems to be playing its best football of the year, while Alabama has been inconsistent down the stretch. In addition, Bulldogs coach Kirby Smart is a master at getting his team to play with an edge in these types of showdowns. I expect a highly motivated Georgia team to play one of its best games of the year. Bulldogs backers should hop on this line soon, as current prices suggest this may move to -3.Bet college football at Caesars Sportsbook, where new users get 20 100% profit boost tokens. Click here to get started:No. 17 Virginia vs. Duke (8 p.m.)Open: Virginia -2.5Current: Virginia -4The ACC Championship Game at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte is another rematch of a game played earlier this season. Just three weeks ago the Cavaliers blew out the Blue Devils, 34-17, in Durham, N.C., in a game Virginia led 31-3 entering the fourth quarter. That result has helped this line shift even more in favor of the Cavaliers. In addition, since Duke qualified for the ACC title game despite being 7-5, there has been a lot of talk about the Blue Devils' worthiness -- or lack thereof -- which almost certainly has influenced the early betting. Over the last five games, Duke's defense has allowed 34.6 points per game. This movement seems more like a market correction.No. 1 Ohio State vs. No. 2 Indiana (8 p.m.)Open: Ohio State -6.5Current: Ohio State -4Though the Buckeyes opened as 6.5-point favorites at Circa, the lookahead line for this game was Ohio State -3.5 two weeks ago, so -4 seems to be the right number for the Big Ten Championship Game at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis. Very little seems to separate these teams. The Buckeyes lead the country in scoring defense (7.8 points per game), while the Hoosiers are second (10.9). Indiana is second in the nation in scoring offense (44.3), while Ohio State is 13th (37.0). The big question with the Buckeyes is whether they will experience a letdown one week after finally beating hated rival Michigan. If you have a strong opinion on this game, I wouldn't be afraid to jump on a number you like as I don't see the line moving significantly prior to kickoff.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Iowa State is set to hire Washington State coach Jimmy Rogers to succeed Matt Campbell, the school announced on Friday. Campbell was tabbed as Penn State's new coach after a long search that began after firing James Franklin in October.Rogers, 38, led Washington State to a 6-6 record in his first and only season. The Cougars, whose schedule was mostly nonconference in the Pac-12 with only Oregon State, faced back-to-back ranked opponents on the road in October, narrowly falling at Ole Miss and at Virginia by a combined five points. Despite the losses, Rogers became just the fourth coach in Washington State history to lead the Cougars to a bowl game in his first season at the helm. Now, Washington State will begin its search for a third coach in as many years after Jake Dickert left for Wake Forest following the 2024 season.\"Jimmy Rogers is a rising star in college athletics who has very strong ties to the Midwest both as a player and as a coach,\" Iowa State AD Jamie Pollard said. \"He has been on my short-list ever since the first time I met him. He immediately impressed me with his interest in Iowa State University and told me during our first visit several years ago that he wanted to be the next head coach at Iowa State.\"Since our initial meeting, I have stayed in close contact with him and have been very impressed with his work ethic and understanding of what it takes to be successful at Iowa State,\" he added. \"He is a proven winner who has demonstrated throughout his career that he will fit our culture.\"\nBefore arriving in Pullman, Washington, Rogers built a decorated résumé as the coach of FCS powerhouse South Dakota State from 2023-24. Rogers guided the Jackrabbits to a perfect 15-0 record during the 2023 campaign, which included a win over Montana in the FCS title game.He followed that with a 12-3 campaign in 2024, capturing a share of the Missouri Valley Football Conference crown and advancing to the FCS semifinals.Over two seasons, he posted a 27-3 record, while overseeing one of the most dominant defensive units in FCS history. South Dakota State led the nation in scoring defense, finishing with just 9.3 points allowed per game in 2023, and ranked among the top teams in total defense, rushing offense and team efficiency.\nJimmy Rogers coaching recordYearSchoolRecordPostseason2023South Dakota State15-0FCS champion2024South Dakota State12-3FCS semifinals2025Washington State6-6Bowl (TBD)Totals3 seasons33-9 (.786)Rogers began his coaching career in 2010 as a graduate assistant at his alma mater, South Dakota State, after finishing his playing career as a two-time all-conference linebacker and team captain. After a brief stint as a graduate assistant at Florida Atlantic in 2012, he returned to South Dakota State as a linebacker coach in 2013. Over the next decade, he rose to assistant head coach and defensive coordinator, mentoring multiple All-America linebackers. His defense consistently ranked among the nation's best, and he earned recognition as the 2022 FCS Coordinator of the Year.Rogers was elevated to the head job after legendary coach John Stiegelmeier retired after the 2023 season.\"My family and I are excited to be joining the Iowa State University community and the Cyclone football program,\" Rogers said. \"Iowa State has been one of the nation's top programs for the last decade and we look forward to building upon its upward trajectory. I'm extremely grateful for the opportunity that Jamie Pollard has given me to lead the Cyclones.\"From the administration, to the alumni and current student-athletes, this university has everything needed to compete at the highest level in college football,\" he added. \"I am honored to be given this opportunity and responsibility and cannot wait to get started.\"Rogers inherits the job from Campbell, the winningest coach Iowa State has ever had. Campbell went 72-55 (.567) over a decade and engineered the program's greatest modern season last year, when the Cyclones finished 11-3 and played in the Big 12 title game.\n            ",

Here's the full list of the groups: \nGroup A: Mexico, Korea Republic, South Africa, UEFA Playoff D (Denmark/North Macedonia/Czechia/North Macedonia)Group B: Canada, Switzerland, Qatar, UEFA Playoff A (Italy/Northern Ireland/Wales/Bosnia and Herzegovina)Group C: Brazil, Morocco, Scotland, HaitiGroup D: USA, Australia, Paraguay, UEFA Playoff D (Turkiye/Romania/Slovakia/Kosovo)Group E: Germany, Ecuador, Ivory Coast, CuracaoGroup F: Netherlands, Japan, Tunisia, UEFA Playoff B (Sweden/Ukraine/Poland/Albania)Group G: Belgium, Iran, Egypt, New ZealandGroup H: Spain, Uruguay, Saudi Arabia, Cabo VerdeGroup I: France, Senegal, Norway, Intercontinental Playoff 2 (Iraq/Bolivia/Suriname)Group J: Argentina, Austria, Algeria, JordanGroup K: Portugal, Colombia, Uzbekistan, Intercontinental Playoff 1 (DR Congo/Jamaica/New Caledonia)Group L: England, Croatia, Panama, GhanaSo with the draw out of the way, let's take a look at our latest World Cup Power Rankings, with reactions to every team's draw: RankTeamAnalysis1. \t\t\t\tSpain  \t\t\t\tThey've got Lamine Yamal, so there are still the most likely to win the tournament especially after landing Uruguay, Saudi Arabia and Cabo Verde. Ah, the last time Saudi Arabia won a match in the group stage it was against Argentina that later won the 2022 World Cup. Might be a good sign. 2. \t\t\t\tArgentina \t\t\t\tTalking about the 2022 World Cup winners, they still have a chance but the group stage isn't as easy as it might look like. Austria and Algeria are strong teams and it won't be easy to win both matches in the group. Lionel Messi is expected to play his last World Cup in his career, and he wants to leave the stage in a good way.       3. \t\t\t\tFrance \t\t\t\tThe group stage will see an incredible matchup between Kylian Mbappe and Erling Haaland, but also the one against Senegal won't be easy at all for the team coached by Didier Deschamps, who will leave after the tournament before the likely appointment of Zinedine Zidane. 4. \t\t\t\tBrazil  \t\t\t\tThe five-team world champions hired Carlo Ancelotti to cope with the disappointments of the past editions and they were extremely unlucky in the draw as they will face Morocco, Haiti and Scotland in the opening three games that will definitely define the ambitions of this team. 5. \t\t\t\tEngland \t\t\t\tEngland will face Croatia in the group stage in one of the most interesting matches, and they will also meet Panama and Ghana. The Three Lions hired an international manager like Thomas Tuchel to overcome the disappointments of two European finals lost in three years and this is their chance. 6. \t\t\t\tPortugal  \t\t\t\tWe almost had a potential meeting between Mbappe and Cristiano Ronaldo but we will save it for later in the tournament. Ronaldo's final World Cup will be a historic moment, but this Portugal side are strong enough to dream big. 7. \t\t\t\tNorway   \t\t\t\tHaaland scored 55 goals with Norway in 48 games. If that's not enough to consider them as a big threat to the other teams, what is? They will immediately face Mbappe and France in the group stage for one of the most intriguing games. 8. \t\t\t\tGermany \t\t\t\tThey are always a team to watch at the World Cup, and after their group stage eliminations in 2018 and 2022, they want revenge. First, they will need to get past of Ecuador, Ivory Coast and Curacao.9. \t\t\t\tNetherlands \t\t\t\tThey are strong but they will face Japan and Tunisia in the group stage, and also one between Poland, Sweden, Ukraine and Albania from the UEFA playoff. That could become a factor. 10. \t\t\t\tMorocco  \t\t\t\tThe biggest surprise of the 2022 World Cup when Morocco only lost to France in the semifinals after winning against Spain and then Portugal. They can make it again but they will face Brazil and Scotland in the group stage. That's something that will make things way more difficult for Achraf Hakimi and his teammates. 11. \t\t\t\tUnited States      Let's be honest: Mauricio Pochettino was really lucky. The USMNT will face Australia, Paraguay and the winner of the UEFA Playoff B (Sweden/Ukraine/Poland/Albania). It couldn't have gone better. 12. \t\t\t\tBelgium  \t\t\t\tA lot will depend on the form of players like Kevin de Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku as they might play their last World Cup if they fully recover from their injuries. 13. \t\t\t\tUruguay \t\t\t\tIt will be fun to see Marcelo Bielsa back at the World Cup after he managed Argentina in 2002 and Chile in 2010. Facing Spain in the group stage is not what he was hoping for.      14. \t\t\t\tJapanWatch out for Japan because they are solid and full of talent. Also the younger national teams look competitive and they can achieve big things in the near future. Only Netherlands are a stronger team in their group.  15. \t\t\t\tSouth Korea  \t\t\t\tSon Heung-min is set to play what will be his last World Cup but there is much more to know about this side that surprised the world when they eliminated Germany at the 2018 World Cup. They will meet Mexico, South Africa and the winner of the UEFA Playoff D (Denmark/North Macedonia/Czechia/Republic of Ireland).16. \t\t\t\tCroatia  \t\t\t\tAnother historic national team preparing for an emotional farewell is Croatia, as Luka Modric, the 2018 Ballon d'Or winner and World Cup finalist, is set to play his final tournament. They will face England, Ghana and Panama. They should end up at least in second place in the table. 17. \t\t\t\tMexico  \t\t\t\tThey have the potential to at least qualify for the round of 32 but watch out for their opponents. They will play the opening match against South Africa in what will be one of the most awaited games of the year. 18. \t\t\t\tSwitzerland \t\t\t\tThe team coached by Murat Yakin qualified for the 2026 World Cup with strong ambitions. If Italy qualify for the World Cup, their group with Qatar and Canada will be much more difficult than what it looks like now. 19. \t\t\t\tEcuador \t\t\t\tLa Tri only conceded five goals in the 17 matches played in the World Cup qualifiers, something that really stands out ahead of the tournament. They will need that defensive strength when they will face Germany, Ivory Coast and Curacao.20. \t\t\t\tIran  \t\t\t\tIran dominated their group stage of qualification, losing only one of the 10 games played, we shouldn't underestimate them as they will face Belgium, Egypt and New Zealand. They have real chances to go through. 21. \t\t\t\tCanada \t\t\t\tJesse Marsch will lead Canada at the 2026 World Cup that will be played on their home soil. A lot will depend on who will qualify in the last spot of the group. If Italy do, things will be much more difficult for Canada. 22. \t\t\t\tAustria \t\t\t\tWhen Ralf Rangnick chose to take over as head coach of the Austrian national team, many people questioned his decision. Now, we understand exactly why he made that choice but he will need to show it against 2022 World Cup winner Argentina. 23. \t\t\t\tEgypt \t\t\t\tThe African team failed to win a single match in their World Cup history with an overall record of five defeats and two draws. They now have the chance to make history with Mohamed Salah leading the team in what will likely be his last World Cup. 24. \t\t\t\tSenegal \t\t\t\tThey dominated the group stage of qualifying as they were undefeated, scoring 22 goals and only conceding only three goals but they will face France and Norway in the group phase. It will be difficult. 25. \t\t\t\tScotland \t\t\t\tThey went to the the worst group possible with Brazil and Morocco. They desperately need the best version of Scott McTominay, the 2024–25 Serie A MVP of the season from Napoli.26. \t\t\t\tSaudi Arabia \t\t\t\tAfter a disappointing spell under Roberto Mancini who left the team in 2024, the Saudi Arabian side called back Herve Renard and will face Spain, Uruguay and Cabo Verde in the group stage. 27. \t\t\t\tColombia \t\t\t\tColombia's seventh World Cup appearance comes from a strong qualification group when they ended up tied on points with teams such as Brazil and Uruguay. They will face Portugal and Cristiano Ronaldo in the group stage.        28. \t\t\t\tTunisia \t\t\t\tWith 22 goals scored, none conceded, nine wins and one draw, Tunisia have been one of the most impressive teams in the qualifiers. They have chances with Japan and Netherlands, but a lot will depend on who will qualify for the last spot between Sweden, Poland, Albania and Ukraine. 29. \t\t\t\tIvory Coast \t\t\t\tThey did not concede a single goal in the group stage of qualifying, scoring 25 times across 10 matches and finishing with eight wins and two draws but they will need to perform against Curacao, Ecuador and most notably against Germany. 30. \t\t\t\tQatar \t\t\t\tThe 2022 World Cup hosts managed to qualify for their second time ever at the World Cup and are coached by former Real Madrid manager Julen Lopetegui, who will finally lead a team at the tournament after what happened with Spain in 2018.       31. \t\t\t\tParaguay  \t\t\t\tIt will be the first time Paraguay will play at the World Cup since 2010 and they will face the USMNT and Australia, while they will wait some months to know who is going to be their final opponent between Turkiye, Romania, Slovakia and Kosovo.32. \t\t\t\tGhana \t\t\t\tThe African side delivered a strong qualifying campaign, winning eight of their 10 matches but they were really unlucky to get both England and Croatia. 33. \t\t\t\tAustralia \t\t\t\tIn 2022, they only lost to Argentina in the round of 16. As mentioned with the United States, things will be much more difficult if Turkiye join the group. 34. \t\t\t\tAlgeriaManaged at the World Cup by former Switzerland coach Vladimir Petkovic, Algeria can compete with Jordan and Austria for a spot in the round of 32. No doubt.35. \t\t\t\tJordanJordan made history by qualifying for the World Cup for the first time. They can't miss this chance and not leave their mark in 2026 and they have a chance with Austria and Algeria, but not with Argentina. 36. \t\t\t\tSouth Africa \t\t\t\tBafana Bafana are back at the World Cup for the first time since they hosted the tournament in 2010 and for the first time in the history, the opening match of the World Cup will be a second timer, with South Africa facing Mexico. 37. \t\t\t\tHaiti \t\t\t\tThe 2026 World Cup will mark Haiti's second appearance at the tournament, their first since 1974. They don't have chances to do better this time as they will face Brazil, Morocco and Scotland in the group. Horrible draw. 38. \t\t\t\tPanama \t\t\t\tAfter qualifying for the 2018 World Cup when they lost all three games against England, Belgium and Tunisia, they will face the Three Lions again, hoping to do better.       39. \t\t\t\tCape Verde \t\t\t\tThey qualified for the first time ever at the World Cup and they are ready to shock the world as they have already done in the qualification stages.  \t\t\t\t40. \t\t\t\tUzbekistan  \t\t\t\tAnother team that will feature at the World Cup for the first time in their history and they will be led by 2006 Ballon d'Or winner and World Cup winner Fabio Cannavaro, their coach. 41. \t\t\t\tNew Zealand \t\t\t\tSame group with Belgium, Iran and Egypt. Hard to think they can get points here. 42. \t\t\t\tCuracao \t\t\t\tThe smallest nation to ever qualify for the World Cup will face giants like Germany, Ivory Coast and Ecuador. What a story, but difficult to imagine they can qualify for the round of 32. \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        The draw for the 2026 FIFA World Cup is finally done. After the best part of 90 minutes of preamble, musical interludes and detailed explanations of draw methodology, the great and good of U.S. sport were unleashed and delivered upon the world a set of fixtures that should be intriguing with the potential for several big matches early on in the tournament. It is worth noting from the outset that the jeopardy is not unduly high for a tournament where the group stage whittles 48 teams down to 32, but there will certainly be a few national team managers who want a word with Aaron Judge or Shaquille O'Neal after what just went down at the Kennedy Center.USMNT boss Mauricio Pochettino is probably not one of those, however, and there seems to be no more obvious spot to start the quadrennial look at the winners and losers than with the nation who will play host to the bulk of this gigantic tournament:Winner: Mauricio PochettinoNow, of course, there are no easy matches in international football. I'm obliged to tell you that even though I know as well as the rest of you that the San Marino national team is a thing that exists. It's important to reaffirm that the other three teams in Group D will have made their way to the World Cup in a much more gruelling fashion than the USMNT did. Australia beat Japan and Saudi Arabia to get here. I'm not sure I'd fancy the U.S. to do that.And yet every potential group out there had its difficulties. A lot of them were more challenging than this. The U.S. had to get a European team but they didn't land the superstars of Norway, the battle-hardened vets in Croatian shirts or the probability that it'd be Italy in Inglewood. This could have been so, so much worse. \nAustralia were beaten 2-1 by a much-changed USMNT in Denver back in October. Paraguay lost by the same scoreline in Philadelphia the following month. Pochettino knows he can beat these teams and that was without the customary home nation bounce. \nThe team coming out of Path C of the European playoffs could be good. You would make Turkiye slight favorites ahead of Romania and then the winner of Slovakia vs. Kosovo. If it were to be Vincenzo Montella's men, then maybe they would also be confident of topping the group, a team that has won a knockout game at the European Championships is to be taken seriously, especially when they field talent on the level of Kenan Yildiz, Hakan Calhanoglu and Arda Guler. It is not like the U.S. are devoid of bright young things either, though, and with momentum finally swinging behind Pochettino, this is a group the hosts should be expecting to top.Now, don't get carried away. I'm delivering you this assessment from a nation who saw Algeria, Slovenia and the USA in their group in 2010 and pronounced it EASY (the y is for Yanks). If the last vestiges of England's golden generation can make fools of themselves, so can their counterparts across the pond. But the chances of a real pratfall on the biggest stage of them all have got that little bit smaller. That's the sign of a good draw.\nCall it What You Want: A weekly podcast where Jimmy Conrad, Charlie Davies and Tony Meola cover all things USMNT and the state of the beautiful game in the United States. Catch the show YouTube live every Tuesday and Thursday at 10 a.m. ET.Winners: The other hostsPochettino's counterparts in the other home nations should be pretty pleased too. Mexico get perhaps the most truly World Cup of World Cup groups. South Africa, South Korea, and maybe Denmark or the Republic of Ireland? That feels so 90s coded that I have to assume Arnold Schwarzenegger is going to be making a cameo. It'll be tough for El Tri but there aren't any mega teams in the mix.There could well be for Canada, though. I really wouldn't take for granted that Italy will beat both Northern Ireland and either Wales or Bosnia and Herzegovina -- I'm convinced that the moment Spain beat the Netherlands in 2010 then the Azzurri took on through osmosis the role of European giants frittering away good but not great talent -- but they're the team you're penciling in to round out Switzerland and Qatar. The presence of the latter is probably good news for the Canadians given that eight of the 12 third-placed teams escape. Don't, however, rule out an upset for a side that has been together for a very long time with Jesse Marsch and has a few game changers. Now, if only Jonathan David could discover some form.\nLosers: ScotlandNow, of course, landing Brazil and Morocco is hardly ideal for Scotland, bringing back as it does the wrong sorts of memories of World Cups gone past. These three made up the bulk of Group A back in 1998, where the Scots' last stand on the World Cup stage ended in familiar fashion: they were credibly beaten 2-1 by reigning champions Brazil and then brushed aside in dispiriting fashion by Morocco.That could well happen again this time around. Morocco have the talent level to at least match their run at the 2022 World Cup. Brazil go into this tournament with the same expectations they have for every other one. You hire a coach like Carlo Ancelotti because you think that what's separating you from the biggest prizes is arched eyebrows and elite-level star maintenance.And yet my suspicion is that the one worry gnawing in the back of Scottish minds even amid the jubilation of being at a World Cup is in the other game. Haiti, playing at this tournament for the first time since 1974 and in pursuit of their first-ever points at the competition. Doesn't it feel a bit Costa Rica 1990 or a bit Iran in 1978? The story of Scotland at the World Cup too often is one of glorious failure against the best sides -- Archie Gemmill dancing through the Dutch defense -- but failure precisely because they made a mess of the games they might have won.\nWinners: Ticket holders Norway vs. FrancePeople going to these matches, you are in for a treat. There was a fear that expanding the tournament to 48 teams might dilute its quality and neuter its competitive stakes. The latter question remains up in the air but if there's anything at all riding on Norway's matchup with France, it'll be a cracker.On one side: Erling Haaland, Martin Odegaard and a group of young players who might be the coming forces of European football. Set against them, you would suspect, Didier Deschamps would gravitate towards a few veterans but he could still surround Kylian Mbappe with world-class talent of any age. This could well be the game of the league phase, the two best strikers in the world coming up against each other with elite supporting casts surrounding them.As for what the stakes might be, you'd assume they wouldn't be nothing. France, who will open up with a tricky clash against Senegal, will be extremely motivated to secure top spot given that it means avoiding another top-four seed until a potential semifinal with Spain. Meanwhile, Senegal's presence in the group alongside Iraq, Bolivia and Suriname shapes for a group that could go a bit six points for each of the top three, meaning wildness right through to the final minutes. And truly, isn't that what we all want?\nLosers: The NetherlandsThere's plenty of contenders for a group of death. Some will say England have been roughly done by with Croatia and Ghana. Perhaps it's the Franco-Norwegian one (but I've already used that for one of these points, so let's say no). Germany's and Brazil's look tricky too. The thing about those groups, mind, is that they mostly have pretty good top seeds. A key factor in what proves to actually be the group of death is often that it has a big team who look like they might be vulnerable.As such, it's Group F that looks quite interesting. The Dutch got hrough their group in qualifying quite easily but their player pool looks a little underwhelming when you get past the defenders. Then you look at a tricky start against Japan, whose abundance of talent perhaps hasn't yet dawned on the wider footballing public. Any team that has beaten Brazil in the last few weeks is eminently capable of a deep run. It is not quite as clear what Tunisia might do but they topped their group in qualifying without conceding a goal. The UEFA Path B winner will be one will be Ukraine, Poland, Albania or Sweden. All could beat the Dutch with the right performance. Imagine the latter of those four, spearheaded by Viktor Gyokeres and Alexander Isak, actually clicked in the coming months.The sheer abundance of qualifying spots for third placed teams means it's hard to believe that there is a group capable of dealing a mortal blow to a big team. If there is, however, it might just be Group F. With quite a few of the wrong breaks, it could be one that has the Netherlands at the bottom of it.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        There is no exact science to hiring a football coach. Sometimes a school goes through a great hiring process, dots all its Is, crosses all its Ts and lands on a perfect candidate -- somebody who checks every box and is hailed by fans and media alike as a grand slam hire. Then, the next thing you know, three years have passed and that incredible hire is being cut a huge check to stop coaching for you because it's been an abject failure.Sometimes you have a terrible process, get turned down by everybody you go after, miss out on candidates who didn't wait around waiting for your call and end up with a horrible hire. Then, sometimes you stumble into success. Sometimes you watch all your top targets get raises and extensions at their current jobs, and you end up making a great hire anyway.Congratulations, Penn State, you did it. You bungled your way into a great hire.I wrote back in October, days after Penn State fired James Franklin, that while Nebraska's Matt Rhule was the favorite for the job, and the coach I felt was most likely to get the job, my top candidate was Iowa State's Matt Campbell. Nearly two months later, Penn State finally agreed. Whether he was the first choice, or depending on how many reports you want to believe, the 432nd doesn't matter. What matters is Campbell is a great choice and should've been one of the first targets.It's a great hire. I have no idea if it will work out. I like its chances, though. It's hard to deny the amount of success Campbell has had at Iowa State, a Power Four program that's long been considered one of the toughest places to win consistently -- yet Campbell did.\nAn overall record of 72-55 with a conference record of 50-40 may not jump off the screen, but Iowa State is a program that has had 12 seasons of eight wins or more in its 128-year existence. Campbell has been the head coach for five of them. He's only had two seasons with fewer than seven wins in his 10 overall, and his 72 wins with the Cyclones are the most in program history. They're 16 more than Dan McCarney, who coached in 14 more games. His .567 win percentage is the highest of any Iowa State coach since 1919. He's also responsible for half the school's seasons of nine wins or more and is the only coach to have won 10 games or more (the Cyclones went 11-3 last season). All of this after he went 35-15 at Toledo in five seasons with a mark of 24-8 in conference play. The man has won and raised the floor everywhere he's been as a head coach.🏈 Inside Matt Campbell's tenure at Iowa State SeasonOverall RecordBig 12 RecordBowl20163–92–7No bowl game20178–55–4Won Liberty Bowl 20188–56–3Lost Alamo Bowl 20197–65–4Lost Camping World Bowl 20209–38–1Won Fiesta Bowl 20217–65–4Lost Cheez-It Bowl 20224–81–8No bowl game20237–66–3Lost Liberty Bowl 202411–37–2Won Pop-Tarts Bowl20258–4*5–4*Bowl eligibleTotal72–5550–407 bowl appearances under Campbell What should matter to Penn State fans, though, is more than the wins and losses. Campbell had a tremendous amount of success at Iowa State while largely recruiting three-star players, but that hasn't stopped the Cyclones from churning out 15 NFL Draft picks since he showed up. That pales in comparison to the number Penn State has produced, but considering the different caliber of player that typically makes their way to each campus every season, Campbell and his Iowa State staff have punched well above their weight when it comes to identifying fits and developing players.\nGive them the keys to Penn State's greater ability to recruit and lure four-star athletes, and it's easy to suspect it will be business as usual in Happy Valley when it comes to churning out NFL players. Something else that matters, and is an area Penn State has plenty of familiarity with, is Campbell's ability to replace coaches. Campbell has seen members of his staff leave for promotions or bigger paychecks elsewhere, and that's at both the college and NFL levels. One of a coach's greatest strengths that often goes overlooked is the ability to fill out a staff and replace members of it. Campbell has done well in this department throughout his decade in Ames, much like James Franklin was able to do when he was seemingly having to replace his defensive coordinator every year.The biggest surprise about the hire to some -- outside of how long it took to get to Campbell -- may be that Campbell took the job. Many viewed him as an Iowa State lifer, and believe me, if you ever mentioned the idea of Campbell being interested in another job on social media, Cyclones fans have never been shy about sharing their thoughts about your intellect for even daydreaming it's possible. His name has been floated for plenty of gigs due to his success in Ames, but year after year, despite the rumors, he remained with the Cyclones.\nThere was mutual interest between Campbell and Florida State before the Seminoles hired Mike Norvell in 2020. Last year, there was plenty of smoke that North Carolina athletic director Bubba Cunningham had Matt Campbell at the top of his list (alongside new Florida coach Jon Sumrall), and that there was mutual interest, before North Carolina's boosters went all-in on Bill Belichick instead. There are myriad reasons why Campbell may have turned down those offers and others to stay at Iowa State.Why might he have changed his mind this time? Well, aside from the fact Penn State is a top program in a top league, there's the current landscape of college football, and how it could affect Iowa State going forward.Campbell built Iowa State into one of the Big 12's best programs the \"old-fashioned way.\" He identified talent to fit what the program does, developed it and coached it. However, in the age of NIL and the portal era, leagues like the Big Ten and SEC are at a financial advantage to begin with due to their conference television deals. There are also recent reports of Iowa State's athletic department facing a $147 million budget deficit by the time the Big 12's current television deal expires in 2031. The school has already halted renovations on its basketball arena, Hilton Coliseum, because of it. Given the importance of money to not only build your roster but keep it together, in the current landscape, Campbell might realize his job is about to become a lot more difficult at Iowa State, which only makes a job like Penn State look more enticing than it already is.\nMuch like the process that led to Campbell taking the job, the reasons behind it don't ultimately matter to Penn State. What matters is that, as tortured as the process may have been, Penn State and athletic director Pat Kraft ended the search at the right place.It certainly isn't the first time somebody has had a difficult time getting to State College, and it won't be the last.\n            ",

And in Week 14, there are a whole bunch of games that could potentially affect what the playoff field looks like come January.We've already seen the Detroit Lions defeat the Dallas Cowboys to improve their own standing and damage that of the Cowboys, but on Sunday and Monday there are a number of games featuring two teams fighting for playoff spots. The Pittsburgh Steelers travel to Baltimore to take on the Ravens. The Jacksonville Jaguars host the Indianapolis Colts. The Chicago Bears take on the Green Bay Packers. The Kansas City Chiefs play the Houston Texans. And the Philadelphia Eagles do battle with the Los Angeles Chargers. \nEach of those matchups features two teams that are either currently in the playoff picture or sitting just outside of it. Amazingly, none of those teams -- even the teams sitting in first or second place in their respective conferences -- can clinch a spot in the playoffs this weekend. There's still more football to be played before that can happen. \n        \n            \n                2025 NFL playoff picture: What Texans-Chiefs means for AFC seeding, wild-card chaos and teams on the bubble\n                \n                    Cody Benjamin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBut there is also the other end of the spectrum to consider.

Also, one can't dismiss that Georgia last played on Friday, with Bama on Saturday, and the Tide have covered just once over their last six games when having a rest disadvantage. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why Alabama can coverBama has two streaks in its favor over Georgia, starting with the fact that the Tide are 4-0 all-time versus the Bulldogs in the SEC Title Game. Additionally, Alabama has won each of its last three meetings with UGA, with two of those coming since Kalen DeBoer replaced Nick Saban. This season, the Crimson Tide are 8-4 ATS, whereas the Bulldogs are just 5-7 versus the line, including failing to cover in each of their last two games. Bama quarterback, Ty Simpson, owns a 25:4 TD:INT, and he's complemented by a defense which has been its typical dominant self as of late. The Tide haven't allowed more than two touchdowns in each of their last five games, and they'll see a team on Saturday that has a negative turnover differential on the season. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Alabama vs. Georgia picksSportsLine's model has simulated Georgia vs. Alabama 10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 53 combined points.

    "body": "\n        Not only is the conference championship up for grabs on Friday night, but so, too, is a potential College Football Playoff berth as No. 20 Tulane hosts No. 24 North Texas in the American Championship Game. Both temas are led by departing coaches (Tulane's Jon Sumrall and North Texas' Eric Morris) who will continue to lead their respective programs through the end of the season, and neither wants this to be the final game for their headman before he exits for his new job.Considering where the American stands in the context of other Group of Five leagues, the longstanding assumption is that the league winner will be the fifth-highest ranked conference champion in the nation. With that designation comes an automatic bid in the CFP, likely as the No. 12 seed. And depending on what happens in the ACC, the victor could be held in even higher regard. Neither the Green Wave nor the Mean Green have ever played in the CFP, so history is on the table regardless of the result.The conference championship game is an on-campus affair in the American. Both teams went 7-1 in league play, but Tulane will host the title bout by virtue of being the highest-ranked American team in the Week 14 CFP Top 25. The Green Wave is unbeaten at home and posted the first 6-0 record in Yulman Stadium history.Follow along with live updates, highlights and analysis as Tulane battles North Texas in the 2025 American Championship Game on Friday. \nWhere to watch Tulane vs. North Texas liveDate: Friday, Dec. 5 | Time: 8 p.m. ETLocation: Yulman Stadium -- New Orleans, LouisianaTV: ABC | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)Tulane vs. North Texas: Need to knowLame-duck coaches: Sumrall and Morris have had their hands full of late, balancing tasks at two different schools. Both were announced as incoming coaches at Power Four universities with Sumrall bound for Florida and Morris set to take over at Oklahoma State. But unlike some coaches on the 2025 carousel (looking at you, Lane Kiffin), their schools permitted them to remain with their respective teams through the end of the season. It is a unique wrinkle in this matchup that brings into question how focused the coaches will be on the task at hand and how motivated their players will be to suit up for coaches who are on their way out.Class of the American: Although it came away victorious just once (2022), Tulane reached the conference championship game each of the last three years and on Friday will become the first program in American history to play in four consecutive title games. The Green Wave is also 29-3 in regular-season conference games dating back to 2022, good for the best winning percentage (.906) of any team in the FBS. It is a stretch of dominance for the Green Wave that spans multiple coaching staffs, which indicates an immense amount of program strength and suggests it will be able to reload once Sumrall departs for Florida.\nMean Green offensive machine: If North Texas defeats the perennial conference title contender and wins its first American crown, it will almost certainly be because of its offense. Redshirt freshman quarterback Drew Mestemaker leads the nation in passing with 3,835 yards, true freshman running back Caleb Hawkins paces the sport in rushing touchdowns (23) and total touchdowns (26), sophomore wide receiver Wyatt Young ranks third nationally with 1,203 receiving yards and the team as a whole is the highest-scoring operation in the country at 46.8 points per game. The Mean Green put up at least 52 points in each of their final three regular-season games.Tulane vs. North Texas prediction, picks\nTulane is the more proven team against high-end competition. The Green Wave defeated a pair of Power Four opponents in Northwestern and Duke and did not lose to a team below .500. Meanwhile, let it not be forgotten that the last time (and only time) North Texas played a ranked team, it lost by 27 points to a conference foe in South Florida. While Mestemaker and his supporting cast could post a number that Tulane simply cannot match, the Green Wave is more battle-tested, familiar with the big stage and boasts home-field advantage. This might be a \"wrong team favored\" situation with Morris' unit laying a field goal on the road.

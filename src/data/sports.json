    "body": "\n        Byes are done with for the 2025 NFL season, which means you have a full complement of Week 15 Fantasy football picks to choose from as the Fantasy playoffs arrive in mayn leagues. There are, however, player injuries, which is a season-long thing to deal with when composing a Fantasy football strategy. Nonetheless, the likes of Stefon Diggs, TreVeyon Henderson, Jaxson Dart, Christian McCaffrey and Rico Dowdle are back in action after being on a bye. But who should start along side them in Week 15 Fantasy football lineups?Speaking of injuries, Daniel Jones (Achilles) was one of many casualties on Sunday, as those who have been riding him all season long at quarterback are likely seeking out some Week 15 Fantasy football advice. His absence has a ripple effect, and while Jonathan Taylor remains a must-start, where do the Fantasy football projections forecast for Colts pass catchers like Michael Pittman Jr., Alec Pierce and Tyler Warren with the Colts uncertain on their quarterbacks plans and even bringing Philip Rivers in as an option?Before making your Week 15 Fantasy football picks, be sure to check out the Week 15 Fantasy football rankings from the proven computer model at SportsLine. Bet on every NFL Week 15 game at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your $5 initial wager wins:When it comes to ranking players, SportsLine's model beat human experts in Fantasy football for the past several seasons, especially when there were big differences in ranking. Over the course of a season, that could literally be the difference between winning your league or going home empty-handed.The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, including being ahead of the curve on players like A.J. Brown, Jonathan Taylor, Derrick Henry, Christian McCaffrey, Alvin Kamara and Jahmyr Gibbs. Anybody who banked on players like those could have made a run at their league title.Now, the model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, has revealed its Fantasy football rankings for Week 15 of the 2025 NFL season. Head to SportsLine now to see them. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. Top Week 15 Fantasy football picks One surprise in Week 15: The model is fading Colts tight end Tyler Warren, who ranks third at his position in both receiving yards and in Fantasy points, may not warrant a spot in Week 15 Fantasy football lineups. Warren is a by-product of Indy's passing game, which just lost Daniel Jones (Achilles) for the season, has Anthony Richardson on IR, and has third-strong rookie, Riley Leonard (knee) dealing with his own ailment, leading to the Rivers signing this week. Warren had season lows in both catches (2) and yards (15) on Sunday, with Leonard playing most of the game. Not much more is expected on Sunday versus Seattle, which has the No. 2 scoring defense and hasn't allowed a tight end touchdown since Week 11. Warren sits outside the top 15 in Fantasy football TE rankings.Another curveball: The model is high on Commanders running back Chris Rodriguez Jr., despite him being the RB50 in standard leagues and being started in just 35% of leagues this week. Rodriguez has leapfrogged Jacory Croskey-Merritt on the depth chart, as the former has more touches each of the last three weeks. He hasn't disappointed with more opportunities as Rodriguez has at least 52 scrimmage yards or a touchdown in five straight games. With the Giants' league-worst run defense on tap, as New York allows the most yards per carry and the second-most rushing yards per game, Rodriguez should find his way into your Week 15 Fantasy football lineups.

This pick could be the difference between winning big and going home with nothing. See the model's entire Week 15 Fantasy football rankings for PPR and standard leagues here.So who should you start and sit this week, and which surprising running back could lead you to victory?

    "body": "\nThe first opportunity to make a Week 15 NFL SGP comes when the Tampa Bay Buccaneers host the Atlanta Falcons on 'Thursday Night Football.'

Thus, your 'Thursday Night Football' same-game parlay may want to rely on NFL player props, spread bets and total predictions.The Over has hit in four of the last five Atlanta games, while it's also hit in three of the last five Tampa games.

While he's averaging a career high in receptions per game this year, much of that was when Michael Penix Jr. was under center as Robinson has had three or fewer catches in five of the last six games started by Kirk Cousins.Additionally, Tampa has contained running backs in the passing game recently. Only one running back has had more than three receptions versus the Bucs over their last seven games, despite facing the likes of Jahmyr Gibbs and Alvin Kamara over that span.

    "body": "\nThe Week 15 NFL DFS contests begin with a 'Thursday Night Football' matchup between the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Atlanta Falcons at 8:15 p.m. ET. Bijan Robinson, Bucky Irving and Emeka Egbuka all found the end zone when these teams met earlier this year, as they'll be amongst the most sought after NFL DFS picks. However, they could also set back your TNF DFS salary cap quite a bit, so you'll have to complement them with low-cost alternatives.  Both squads utilize multiple running backs, so Tyler Allgeier, Rachaad White and Sean Tucker deserve consideration for your NFL DFS strategy. Rostering low-risk, high-reward players is what everyone playing daily Fantasy football manager seeks, but knowing which of these options to insert into NFL DFS lineups is always the challenge. One of those could be the returning Mike Evans, who is active for Tampa. Before making any Buccaneers vs. Falcons NFL DFS picks on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings for 'Thursday Night Football,' be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure.\nMcClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings. He uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every snap of NFL action, taking factors such as matchups, statistical trends, and injuries into account. This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings, including. In 2023, he finished tied for first in the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once. Anyone who has followed him could be way up.Now, McClure has turned his attention to 'Thursday Night Football' and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. Top NFL DFS picks for Falcons vs. BuccaneersOne of McClure's top NFL DFS picks for 'Thursday Night Football' is Falcons running back Bijan Robinson. The Pro Bowler is as consistent a Fantasy player as any running back, as he has at least 88 scrimmage yards in all but one game. That includes 124 total yards versus Tampa in Week 1, as he has back-to-back outings versus the Bucs with 100-plus yards and a touchdown. Robinson ranks second amongst all running backs in 2025 in receiving yards, which should certainly come in handy on Thursday. That's because the Buccaneers have allowed the most receiving yards to opposing running backs. In Week 14, Tampa allowed sixth-round rookie RB Devin Neal of New Orleans to have 84 total yards and a score, which could be Robinson's Fantasy floor for TNF. See who else to roster at SportsLine. Bet Bijan Robinson to go Over 76.5 rushing yards at DraftKings:\nMcClure is also building his 'Thursday Night Football' NFL DFS strategy around Bucs quarterback Baker Mayfield, who has diced up Atlanta's defense recently. Mayfield has three passing touchdowns in each of his last three starts versus the Falcons while also averaging 27 rushing yards over this stretch. The Falcons defense also allowed three passing touchdowns last week and has given up an average of 278 passing yards over the last four games, despite facing the likes of Tyler Shough, Tyrod Taylor and Bryce Young. The Falcons defense, however, has kept its last four opponents to an average of under 100 rushing yards, so the Bucs should lean on Mayfield's arm on Thursday. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine. Bet Baker Mayfield to go Over 214.5 passing yards at DraftKings right here:\nHow to set 'Thursday Night Football' NFL DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Thursday Night Football'. This pick could be the difference between winning your tournaments and cash games or going home with nothing. You can only see who it is, and the rest of McClure's NFL DFS picks, at SportsLine.So who is Mike McClure including in his optimal NFL DFS lineups for 'Thursday Night Football', and which under-the-radar player offers huge value? Visit SportsLine now to see optimal NFL DFS picks, NFL DFS rankings, NFL DFS advice and NFL DFS stacks, all from a daily Fantasy expert with more than $2 million in winnings, and find out. \n            ",

This USA Basketball camp, held on the Duke University campus from Dec. 12-14, is a chance to set the tone for the players, the coaching staff and for Bird as well. \"I've definitely had some moments where it's like, 'Oh, I'm not a player anymore. This is totally different. Like, oh, I kind of have to wear all my team-issued stuff now,\" Bird told the media on Thursday afternoon. \"But for the most part, you know, it's been great. Everybody with USA Basketball has been super helpful.\"Bird was named the first-ever managing director of the U.S. women's national team in May. Her first task was to hire Duke head coach Kara Lawson to lead the five-on-five Olympic team through the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Her next big task will be to finalize a roster for the 2026 World Cup Qualifiers in March. For now, Bird is content to be a \"fly on the wall\" and observe the young player pool on hand in Durham. Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese, Paige Bueckers and USC guard JuJu Watkins are among 10 players attending their first senior 5-on-5 camp. For players like the injured Watkins or a recovering Clark, Bird is looking for these young Team USA hopefuls to learn, even if only, for now, through inclusion. \n\"It's just a great opportunity to get their first feel, to get their first taste,\" she said. Bird said not to read into the absence of marquee stars such as A'ja Wilson, Napheesa Collier and Breanna Stewart. With months to go before the next competition, USA Basketball cast a wide net of invitations, knowing some players may have other obligations at this time of the basketball season. \"In the landscape of women's basketball, which is ever-changing, offseason opportunities are ever-changing. I don't think any player that you might think would have been here, not being here, has larger meaning,\" she said. \nNor do the absences spell a lack of desire for athletes to attend camp in years without a competition. Instead, the players attending are part of a larger strategy ahead of the Women's World Cup in Berlin next September, when Team USA will be going going for its fifth straight gold medal.\"We try to get multiple camps in throughout a year, because you do want to have everybody to get a taste of it, so you can have carryover, right? So by the time you do get to a World Cup, people will have been involved at some point, to have that feel for it,\" Bird said. While the newcomers are making the headlines, there are plenty of veterans at camp, too, including Kahleah Copper, Kelsey Plum, Brionna Jones and Jackie Young. \n\"This is when the veterans really come alive, right? This is when they can be a huge part of setting that tone, not just the coaches, but those vets. I mean, they've been there. They know what it's like, and with the way that they act, maybe with the way that they can be vocal, they're going to teach the younger players,\" Bird said.Assisting Lawson at the camp will be will be court coaches Natalie Nakase (Golden State Valkyries), Nate Tibbetts (Phoenix Mercury) and Stephanie White (Indiana Fever)\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Before the 2025 Heisman Trophy winner is revealed on Saturday, the Heisman Trust unveiled the results for the players that finished fifth through 10th in this year's voting. Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love, Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza, Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia and Ohio State quarterback Julian Sayin were announced Monday as finalists for college football's most prestigious individual award. Those four will be on hand for the Heisman ceremony in New York City on Saturday. The players who just missed the cut are Texas Tech linebacker Jacob Rodriguez, who finished fifth ahead of Ohio State wide receiver Jeremiah Smith (sixth), Georgia quarterback Gunner Stockton (seventh), Ole Miss quarterback Trinidad Chambliss (eighth), Ohio State safety Caleb Downs (ninth), and Georgia Tech quarterback Haynes King, who finished 10th.\n        \n            \n                Heisman Trophy finalists 2025: Fernando Mendoza, Diego Pavia, Jeremiyah Love, Julian Sayin headed to New York\n                \n                    Will Backus                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nRodriguez, who won the Bronko Nagurski Trophy for the nation's top defender, heads the Red Raiders' monstrous defense.

The Red Raiders are the No. 4 seed and have a first-round bye in the College Football Playoff. \nSmith won Big Ten Receiver of the Year for the second consecutive season, and Downs won both Defensive Player of the Year and Defensive Back of the Year for the conference. No. 2 Ohio State is the first team to have three top-10 Heisman finishers in the same year since 2020, when Alabama had DeVonta Smith (who won the award), Mac Jones and Najee Harris.Stockton led No. 3 Georgia to its second straight SEC Championship Game victory. He has thrown 23 touchdown passes and just five interceptions, the third-best ratio in the SEC. Chambliss led the SEC in that metric, firing 18 touchdown passes and just three interceptions for an Ole Miss offense that leads the Power Four in yards per game.King was one of the game's best dual-threat quarterbacks, throwing for 12 touchdowns and rushing for 15 more. He was the only player to reach double digits in both categories this season.\nThe Heisman Trophy will be presented Saturday night in New York.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        In a little less than a month, I will put out my first set of 2026 Dynasty Fantasy Football rankings. A month after that, I will breakdown the state of each position heading into free agency and the 2026 NFL Draft. One position that will require a lot of thinking is the quarterback position. Part of that is because of the uncertainty of the future for Kyler Murray, Daniel Jones, and other veterans. A bigger issue is how uncertain I still feel about the 2025 rookie class. This last month of the season could go a ways in clarifying that.Cam Ward, the number one pick, has been mostly awful for Fantasy Football in entirely awful circumstances. He showed some life in the middle of the season, but he has now averaged 4.9 yards per pass attempt in his last four games. If he doesn't show something more in this final month, it will be hard to keep him in the top 20.Jaxson Dart has been by far the best rookie QB, but he has also averaged 194 passing yards per game as a starter. Dart produced some insane numbers with his legs, but in his first game back from his concussion, he had a season-low four rush attempts. If Dart's last month looks anything like his first, he is probably a top 12 Dynasty QB in January. If the Giants are more hesitant to call designed runs for him and he isn't more productive as a passer, he may not crack the top 15.This week, we had a one-man mailbag on Fantasy Football Today Dynasty. We talked about the 2026 rookie class and just how valuable those 2026 rookie picks are. Check it out:\nA month ago, this article may have stopped with Dart. But Tyler Shough and Shedeur Sanders have done just enough lately to wonder if they could get a chance to start Week 1 of 2026. Both have more work to do to earn that opportunity, and winning a game or two to harm their draft position wouldn't hurt. Sanders, in particular, has an excellent opportunity to build on last week's 364-yard, 3 TD performance that led the Browns to name him their starter the rest of the season. Both Sanders and Shough will be ranked in January, with the risk that their team adds a QB this offseason. But they could skyrocket in May if they are the QB1 on the roster. Both could be good buys, particularly for rebuilders, but any offer has to factor in the risk that they are a career backup. \nAs always, you can get my weekly updated Dynasty Trade Charts over on SportsLine.

    "body": "\nMidway through the 2025 NFL season, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers appeared to be in control of the NFC South. With four games remaining, they are in danger of missing the playoffs for the first time since 2019.Tampa Bay (7-6), which won six of its first eight contests to build a two-game division lead over Carolina, has lost four of five and finds itself in a dogfight with the Panthers (7-6) for first place. The Buccaneers, who face Carolina twice over the final three weeks of the campaign and currently own the tiebreaker between the clubs, look to maintain the upper hand in the battle when they open Week 15 against the Atlanta Falcons (4-9) at 8:15 p.m. ET on Thursday Night Football at Raymond James Stadium.The Buccaneers are coming off a surprising 24-20 home loss to the New Orleans Saints in which Baker Mayfield completed less than half of his pass attempts (14-of-30) for only 122 yards. Atlanta has lost seven of its last eight games, including a 37-9 drubbing at the hands of the Seattle Seahawks in Week 14, but is hoping to avenge a 23-20 home setback against Tampa Bay in the season opener.Four games are on Thursday's NBA schedule, including a matchup between the Portland Trail Blazers (9-15) and New Orleans Pelicans (3-22) at 8 p.m. ET at the Smoothie King Center. Portland is wrapping up a five-game road trip during which it lost three of the first four contests, while New Orleans is looking to halt a seven-game losing streak.The NHL has 13 contests on its slate, one of which has the Atlantic Division-leading Detroit Red Wings (17-11-3) visiting Rogers Place for a meeting with the Edmonton Oilers (13-11-6) at 9 p.m. ET. Detroit is 3-0-1 on its six-game road trip, while Edmonton has gone 2-1-1 on its five-game homestand.Thursday's 13-game college basketball schedule features a clash between Iowa (8-1) and fourth-ranked Iowa State (9-0) at 8 p.m. ET at the Hilton Coliseum in Ames, Ia. The Hawkeyes' lone loss came in their only true road game of the season and they now visit a Cyclones squad that is 4-0 at home.The Buccaneers are 5.5-point favorites against the Falcons in the latest consensus NFL odds. Meanwhile, the Trail Blazers are 4.5-point favorites against the Pelicans, the Oilers are -180 favorites on the money line versus the Red Wings and Iowa State is a 10.5-point favorite against Iowa.Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Thursday, Dec. 11. All times EasternNFL best bets, where to watchFalcons at BuccaneersTime: 8:15 p.m. | Location: Tampa, Fla. | TV: Prime Video | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Over 44 (-112) | Expert: Falcons +4.5 (-105, R.J. White)Both teams are in the bottom half of the NFL in scoring, with the Buccaneers averaging 23 points and the Falcons producing 19.4 per game. But five of Atlanta's last six games have gone Over the projected total for Thursday's showdown and Tampa Bay was involved in shootouts with the New England Patriots (51 total points) and Buffalo Bills (76) during its current funk. The Buccaneers' offense could receive a spark as wideout Mike Evans may return from the broken collarbone that has sidelined him for six games, and fellow receiver Jalen McMillan (neck) might make his season debut. The SportsLine Projection Model is leaning toward the Over, which hits in 51% of its simulations, and SportsLine NFL expert R.J. White (+1321 on his last 265 NFL picks) likes the Falcons to cover the spread as only two of the Bucs' seven wins this season were by more than three points.\nNBA best bets, where to watchTrail Blazers at PelicansTime: 8 p.m. | Location: New Orleans | TV: League Pass | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Under 241 (-112) | Expert: Trail Blazers -179 (Tim Doyle)Portland is in the middle of the pack in the league with an average of 117.4 points and is coming off a loss to the Memphis Grizzlies in which it was held under triple digits (96) for just the second time this season. New Orleans had a rare offensive surge last time out, scoring 132 points in Monday's setback against the San Antonio Spurs, but has produced 113 per game in 2025-26. The Trail Blazers and Pelicans combined for 242 points in their first meeting this campaign, but the SportsLine Projection Model doesn't see this matchup reaching that total as its simulations say the Under hits more than 66% of the time. SportsLine basketball expert Tim Doyle (+318 on his last five NBA picks) believes Portland will post its fifth victory in 17 games as it has had three days off since its 23-point loss at Memphis.NHL best bets, where to watchRed Wings at OilersTime: 9 p.m. | Location: Edmonton | TV: ESPN+ | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Oilers -180 | Expert: Oilers -1 (-123, Matt Severance)The Red Wings have posted three consecutive victories and earned points in six straight contests (4-0-2). They're coming off a 4-3 triumph over the Flames in Calgary on Wednesday, but they've played on back-to-back nights four times thus far this season and lost the second game on three occasions - including both times when each of the consecutive contests were on the road. The SportsLine Projection Model thinks that trend will continue as Edmonton wins in 64% of its simulations, and SportsLine expert Matt Severance is backing the Oilers to cover the spread as he feels playing for the second time in two nights again will be too much for Detroit.CBB best bets, where to watchIowa at Iowa StateTime: 8 p.m. | Location: Ames, Iowa | TV: FS1 | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Iowa +10.5 (-110) | Expert: Under 143.5 (-110, Bruce Marshall)Sure, Iowa State has recorded eight of its nine victories this season by 16 or more points and is coming off a 23-point triumph over then-No. 1 Purdue. And yes, Iowa's only loss this campaign was a 19-point setback against the only ranked team (then-No. 7 Michigan State) it has faced thus far in 2025-26. But the Hawkeyes are second in the Big Ten with an average of 62.6 points allowed and are limiting opponents to 43.6% shooting. The SportsLine Projection Model believes the Hawkeyes can do enough defensively against the Cyclones, as its simulations have them covering the spread 60% of the time. SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall (+185 on his last six college basketball picks) also thinks Iowa can slow down Iowa State and is backing the Under.\n            ",

    "body": "\nA stretch during which they lost five of seven games put the Pittsburgh Steelers in danger of falling out of first place in the AFC North. But Mike Tomlin's club withstood a late comeback attempt by the Baltimore Ravens last week to post a 27-22 road victory and remain atop the division. The Steelers attempt to strengthen their hold on first place in Week 15 of the 2025 NFL season when they host the streaking Miami Dolphins at Acrisure Stadium on Monday Night Football.It appeared as if Pittsburgh (7-6) would run away and capture its first division title since 2020 as it won four of its first five games and owned a 2 1/2-game lead after Week 6. That advantage was aided by a 2-4 start by the Cincinnati Bengals, who lost quarterback Joe Burrow for more than two months to a toe injury in Week 2, and 1-5 beginnings by both the Ravens and Cleveland Browns.However, the Steelers won only two of their following six contests, while Baltimore reeled off five consecutive victories to pull even with Pittsburgh in the standings at 6-5. The teams remained tied as both lost in Week 13, and the Steelers owned an 11-point lead after three quarters in their showdown last Sunday and held on for the win to move one game ahead of the Ravens with four remaining.\nWideout DK Metcalf had his best performance since being acquired by Pittsburgh last March after spending the first six years of his NFL career with the Seattle Seahawks, hauling in seven passes for 148 yards. But the Steelers' 29th-ranked ground attack (89.2 yards) produced only 34 yards while their defense allowed Baltimore to rush for 217.Pittsburgh is 21st in the league against the run (125.3 yards allowed) but even worse defending the pass, as it ranks 28th with an average of 244 yards allowed through the air. The club also is 28th in total defense (369.3 yards allowed) but sixth with 36 sacks. The Steelers could have trouble recording one against Miami as three-time NFL sack leader T.J. Watt, who is first on the team this year with seven, was hospitalized Wednesday because of a lung issue and could miss Monday's contest.The Dolphins (6-7) were left for dead after losing six of their first seven games this season but have come out of nowhere to ever so slightly get back into the playoff picture. They have won four straight contests and five of their last six, although four of those victories came against teams with records of 4-9 or worse.Miami is one of the better rushing clubs in the league, as it ranks eighth with an average of 126.5 yards per game. The ground assault is led by De'Von Achane, who is third in the NFL with a career-high 1,126 yards. The 24-year-old posted three consecutive 100-yard performances and was on his way to a fourth straight last week as he gained 92 yards before leaving in the second quarter of a 34-10 rout of the New York Jets with a rib injury.Achane is questionable for the matchup against the Steelers, but the Dolphins historically don't perform well in cold weather. The high temperature in Pittsburgh for Monday is 20 degrees Fahrenheit, and it certainly will be below that at game time. The weather is of no concern to SportsLine's Inside the Lines team, which doesn't foresee Miami qualifying for the postseason regardless of the outcome of Monday night's contest. The ITL team's model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, currently gives the Dolphins a 0.1% chance of making the playoffs and puts that number at 0.3% should they defeat the Steelers.Meanwhile, the model strongly believes the Steelers will make their third consecutive postseason appearance and fifth in six years. It puts Pittsburgh's chances at more than 73% and increases them to just over 79% with a victory on Monday. However, with the Steelers trailing four teams - including the three that occupy wild card berths - by at least one game, the model feels their best method of going to the playoffs is winning a division title.CHANCES OF MAKING PLAYOFFSTEAMCURRENTWITH WEEK 15 WINWITH WEEK 15 LOSSDIFFERENCEPittsburgh Steelers73.5%79.2%62.2%17.0%CHANCES OF WINNING AFC NORTHTEAMCURRENTWITH WEEK 15 WINWITH WEEK 15 LOSSDIFFERENCEPittsburgh Steelers73.2%78.6%62.2%16.4%Baltimore Ravens23.9%36.7%9.7%27.0%Pittsburgh follows its Monday night matchup with road games against the Detroit Lions and Browns before ending the regular season at home versus Baltimore.

    "body": "\n        CINCINNATI -- If you've ever been to an awkward birthday party, then you definitely have a slight idea of how it felt during Joe Burrow's weekly press conference this week. The Bengals franchise quarterback turned 29 on Wednesday, but he was in no mood to celebrate. Some people love when their birthday comes around, but for others, it's just a 24-hour existential crisis where nothing could possibly go right and that seemed to be where Burrow was. Four years ago at this time, Burrow had just turned 25 and he was two months away from playing in the Super Bowl. Since then, not much has gone right. The Bengals did make a return trip to the AFC title game in 2022, but that was followed by a 2023 season where he missed the final seven games of the year due to injury after tearing a ligament in his right wrist. Half of Burrow's career has been spent rehabbing from some sort of injury. There was an ACL tear in 2020 followed by the wrist in 2023 followed by the toe injury this year that knocked him out for nine games. And those are just the major ones, he's also dealt with several other injuries like a calf strain in July of 2023. Burrow may not have been directly complaining about the team with his recent comments, but after sitting in on almost every press conference he's held since July, I can tell you this: He's methodical and he thinks long and hard about everything he says before he puts it out there. With Joe Burrow, there are no accidental messages. \n\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 15 viewer's guide: Top 10 things to watch, including Super Bowl contenders and Philip Rivers comeback\n                \n                    Douglas Clawson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAlthough he sounded down in the dumps on Wednesday, let's flash back to Sunday real quick. After throwing two back-breaking interceptions in a 39-34 loss to the Bills, no one would have been surprised if he had been upset or had a negative tone, but instead, Burrow almost sounded thankful that he was even able to be on the field for the Bills game. \"I fought my butt off to get back to this spot and to be able to be out there with everybody for our organization and the city, so that's what I'm going to continue to do,\" Burrow said in his postgame interview. \"I take it very seriously. I love what I do and I'm going to continue to do it.\" As he said, he fought to get back on the field for the organization and city. The organization. The city. That's telling. That sounds like a guy who wants to be in Cincinnati. That  And that last sentence from Burrow is the one you should pay attention to: Joe Burrow loves playing football, which is why it's almost impossible to see this ever turning into an Andrew Luck situation. That being said, it's fair to mention Luck's name, because Burrow has now missed 22 games due to injury in his career, which puts him just four behind Luck, who missed 26 total before his abrupt retirement in 2019. \nEven if a retirement is unlikely, the Bengals have already run one former No. 1 overall pick out of town -- Carson Palmer demanded a trade out of Cincinnati back in 2011 because he didn't think he could win a Super Bowl with Mike Brown owning the team -- and although Burrow doesn't seem to be there yet, the Bengals need be paying close attention when he sends out public messages like he did on Wednesday. Let's take a look at a few of Burrow's most notable comments along with the question that he got asked to elicit those comments. \nQ: Does coming back from a serious injury change your competitive fire at all? How does the toe injury maybe change the way you view the game?\nBURROW: \"It certainly doesn't change my desire to win. If I want to keep doing this, I have to have fun doing it. I've been through a lot, and if it's not fun, then what am I doing it for? That's the mindset I'm trying to bring to the table.\"The comeback from the injury has clearly been weighing on Burrow and whether all the rehab is worth it. \"I think I've been through more than most, and it's certainly not easy on the brain or the body, so I'm just trying to have fun doing it again,\" Burrow said. \nBurrow wasn't supposed to come back until mid-December, but he ended up returning almost a month earlier than expected because he worked his tail off in rehab. However, his efforts have basically now gone to waste after just two games because the Bengals are essentially out of the playoff race following Sunday's loss to the Bills, so it's easy to see why some of the joy might have been sucked out of the game for him this week. Although he's lived in rehab for a good chunk of the past five years, Burrow certainly understands the risks of football as well as anyone. The QB was asked what it's like balancing his well-being versus wanting to come back as quickly as possible and he gave an insightful answer. \"It's something you have to think about,\" Burrow said. \"That's life as a professional athlete. It's no different in basketball, MMA or baseball. It's what we chose. We make a lot of sacrifices and your body is often one of them.\"\nThe most interesting part of Burrow's press conference came when he was asked, point blank, if he had something on his mind because he seemed frustrated. \"There's a lot of things going on right now,\" the QB responded. Are those frustrations football-related or personal? \"All the above.\"That's a wide net to cast: Burrow could be frustrated with himself, with the team, with the organization. with the coaching, with his personal life, with his birthday cake, but the bottom line is that he's frustrated. Burrow is someone who hates losing and you can see it clearly on his face after any loss and if he doesn't think the Bengals are doing enough to fix the team's problems, you could easily see a situation where he starts to think that enough is enough, but let's be clear, he's not going anywhere any time soon. \nOne reason it's hard to see the Burrow situation turning out like the Palmer situation is because the Bengals actually listen to Burrow. Last year, he went on a media tour at the Super Bowl and made it clear that he wanted to see Ja'Marr Chase, Tee Higgins and Trey Hendrickson all get re-signed. And the Bengals did it. Burrow and Chase are signed through 2029 while Higgins is signed through 2028. The Bengals have a strong offensive nucleous and Burrow isn't going to be ditching that any time soon. So what are some of the other issues? The team has struggled on the offensive line in Burrow's tenure, but it's not for a lack of trying. The Bengals have signed several key free agents (like Orlando Brown and Ted Karras) and they've also used draft capital on the line, including two players who have each started at least 11 games this year (Amarius Mims and Dylan Fairchild). The line has been better, so it seems unlikely that Burrow is frustrated with them. As a matter of fact, he actually complimented the offensive line on Wednesday. Besides talking about Pokemon, the only other comment he seemed enthusiastic about was talking about the offensive line. \nIf the Bengals are going to make any changes this offseason, it's going to have be on the defensive side of the ball. Burrow put up MVP numbers in 2024, but the Bengals didn't make the playoffs because they had a historically bad defense. In 2025, that defense somehow got worse. The unit has definitely improved over the past few weeks and although that sounds like good news, it could also be viewed as a bad thing, because it might convince key decision-makers in the organization that changes don't need to be made. The Bengals have Joe Burrow in his prime and they're about to miss the playoffs for the third straight season. Everyone in the front office needs to ask themselves why that's happening. It's frustrating for fans, it's frustrating for players and it's certainly frustrating for Burrow. It's the kind of frustration that should lead to changes this offseason and Burrow needs to let the team know what kind of changes he wants to see. This organization isn't going to win a Super Bowl anytime soon without Joe Burrow, so keeping him happy should be a top priority.The Bengals have most of the pieces in place to be a Super Bowl contender, they just need to find the missing pieces to the Super Bowl puzzle and then give that puzzle to Burrow for his next birthday. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        T.J. Watt was taken to a Pittsburgh area hospital for further evaluation of his lung after experiencing discomfort at the Steelers practice facility on Wednesday, the team announced. Watt did not practice on Thursday and his status for Pittsburgh's upcoming game against the Miami Dolphins is in question. \"I'm a little bit cautious about what I say, because I am not a medical expert,\" Steelers coach Mike Tomlin told reporters Thursday. \"But to make a long story short, he was experiencing some discomfort when he was at the facility [Wednesday}. So, we took him to the docs and they're going through some procedures. He stayed overnight in the hospital.\"He has a lung situation that's being addressed. I think he has some testing and so forth ahead of him this afternoon, and that's all I know at this juncture. He and I communicated last night, he was comfortable, and that's all I have really at this point.\" \nTomlin said he learned of Watt's situation when he was in the team's cafeteria on Wednesday. While he doesn't know when or what prompted Watt's discomfort, Tomlin does not think that it is anything that would have led to him being on the team's injury report. \"Not to my knowledge at all, particularly in game or after the game, nothing,\" he said. The 31-year-old Watt is in the middle of his ninth season with the Steelers, who selected him with the 30th overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft. \nA seven-time Pro Bowler and four-time All-Pro, Watt won NFL Defensive Player of the Year honors in 2021 after tying the league's single-season record of 22.5 sacks. Watt, who has led the NFL in sacks on three separate occasions, is the Steelers' career leader with 115 sacks. Earlier this season, he surpassed his brother and future Hall of Famer JJ Watt on the NFL's career sack list. In 13 games this season, Watt has recorded 7.0 sacks, three forced fumbles, two fumble recoveries and an interception for the Steelers, who are currently 7-6 and lead the Baltimore Ravens by one game in the AFC North standings. If Watt can't face Miami, he will be replaced by Nick Herbig, a fellow former Wisconsin Badger who has made nine starts over the past two years. This season, Herbig has recorded a career-high 6.5 sacks to go with three forced fumbles, a fumble recovery and an interception. \nWatt is the second Steelers player to be hospitalized in recent days. Following Pittsburgh's Week 14 win over the Ravens, wideout DK Metcalf stayed overnight in a Baltimore area hospital after experiencing stomach pains. Tomlin said earlier this week that Metcalf is \"moving in the right direction.\" The Steelers are also dealing with injuries to tight end Darnell Washington, offensive tackle Andrus Peat, linebacker Malik Harrison, cornerback James Pierre, defensive linemen Keeanu Benton and Derrick Harmon, and safety Kyle Dugger. Washington, Peat, and Harrison are in the concussion protocol. Pierre and Benton dealing with calf and ankle injuries, respectively, that were sustained during last Sunday's win over Baltimore. Dugger (hand) has a chance to play against the Dolphins after missing last Sunday's game. Harmon's status for Monday night is up on the air as he has missed Pittsburgh's last two games with a knee injury. \nLike Watt, Harmon has made a significant impact on Pittsburgh's defense during his rookie season. The Steelers are allowing just 96 rushing yards per game when he plays but has given up an average of 191.3 rushing yards per game during the four games that he has not played in this season. \n            ",

The Bucs play three division games in the final four weeks of the season and need to stack wins in those contests, starting with this one on Thursday night.Atlanta has been on an even bigger slide, losing seven of its last eight games. The Falcons aren't even playing for draft positioning, either, because they traded their first-round pick to the Rams during last year's draft. They are playing out the string here and fighting for jobs next season and in the future.Which of these two teams will be able to stop their recent stretch of poor play? We'll find out soon enough. But before we break down some of the key storylines, here's a look at how you can watch the game. Where to watch Buccaneers vs. FalconsDate: Thursday, Dec. 11 | Time: 8:15 p.m. ETLocation: Raymond James Stadium (Tampa, Florida)Stream: Prime VideoFollow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Buccaneers -4.5, O/U 44.5 via DraftKings SportsbookKey StorylinesNFC South race. The Buccaneers and Panthers are tied with matching 7-6 records, but the Bucs currently sit in first place in the division thanks to the common opponents tiebreaker. (They haven't played each other yet and they're both 2-1 in the division, so they have to go to the third tiebreaker to decide which team is ahead.) Tampa plays Atlanta here, then travels to Carolina next week and Miami the week after before hosting the Panthers to end the season. The Panthers get the Saints on the road this week before hosting the Bucs and Seahawks and then traveling to Tampa to end the year. Buccaneers injury returns. The Bucs have already gotten Bucky Irving back and now they are getting Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan back as well. Evans has been out since suffering a collarbone injury back in Week 4. McMillan has yet to play this season after suffering a neck injury during the preseason. The Bucs offense has not been as good lately as it was to start the season, so these returns should provide a significant boost.Falcons in a tailspin. Atlanta has lost seven of its last eight games after starting the season 3-2. There could be changes on the horizon if Raheem Morris and Co. can't turn things around down the stretch. Doing so is going to be difficult because they're working with a backup quarterback and a defense that has badly regressed since starting the season as one of the hotter units in the league. If the Falcons continue to stumble, we could see a new head coach and/or general manager in Atlanta next season.Buccaneers vs. Falcons prediction, pick\nTampa isn't exactly lighting the world on fire of late, but the Falcons seem to be dead in the water. Tampa should be able to move the ball on Thursday night, especially with Evans and McMillan returning to from injury. The Falcons, meanwhile, seemingly cannot move the ball with any degree of consistency with Kirk Cousins under center. The Bucs have a good run defense and are weaker against the pass, which plays against what the Falcons would like to do given the current state of their roster. \nPick: Buccaneers 24, Falcons 13 | (Tampa Bay -4.5, Under 44.5)\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

He spent the 2025 season on staff as the Golden Eagles' offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach, marking his second stint with the program after his 2008-11 tenure as an assistant.Anderson's elevation puts him back in charge of a program for the first time since Utah State fired him for cause in 2024. He previously oversaw the Arkansas State and Utah State programs and posted a 74-53 record across the two schools with nine bowl appearances in 10 years. Anderson won the Sun Belt twice with the Red Wolves and the Mountain West once with the Aggies.\"We are excited to announce Blake Anderson as the next leader of our football program,\" Southern Miss athletic director Jeremy McClain said. \"He brings a wealth of experience and a ten-year run as a successful head coach, including multiple conference championships in the Sun Belt, a Mountain West conference championship, and nine bowl appearances. Blake is an exceptional leader, a great communicator, and has the respect of the players and the staff throughout the Duff Center. We look forward to supporting him at the highest level and continuing the positive momentum for our program.\"Utah State fired Anderson just over a month prior to the start of the 2024 season after an internal investigation concluded that he violated university Title IX policies. After an Aggies football player was arrested for alleged domestic violence in April 2023, Utah State said that Anderson did not immediately report the incident to the Office of Equity and instead conducted a personal investigation -- which included the contacting of the player's girlfriend and roommate -- to determine whether punitive action should be taken against the player.\nAnderson filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against Utah State, and his lawyers accused the university of leading \"what is essentially a public smear campaign\" against their client.Anderson's coaching experience dates back to 1992 and features numerous stops throughout the Group of Five ranks. He also spent two seasons as the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at North Carolina from 2012-13.\nThe best year of Anderson's career came in 2021 when he led Utah State to a Mountain West title and defeated Oregon State in the LA Bowl. The Aggies won 11 games that season, matching a program record. They also cracked the AP Top 25 poll for just the fifth time in program history.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 Major League Baseball offseason is fully underway, and with the Winter Meetings freshly behind us we're working our way deeper into the sport's offseason calendar. Among other things, the winter in baseball means a steady supply of rumors regarding free agent signings, trades, and the like. Speaking of which, you can find Thursday's roundup just below. Braves land reliever SuarezThe Atlanta Braves have agreed to terms with free-agent closer Robert Suarez on a three-year, $45 million contract, the club announced on Thursday. \nEarlier in the offseason, CBS Sports ranked Suarez as the No. 21 available free agent in the current class. Here's part of RJ Anderson's write-up: \"Suarez has garnered a reputation for flakiness. It's not entirely merited. Over the last three seasons, he's compiled more shutdowns and fewer meltdowns than Jeff Hoffman, Ryan Helsley, Matt Strahm, among other high-leverage pitchers with a higher perceived trust rating. One part of Suarez's repute that is valid: his fastball dependency. He upped his changeup rate year to year, but he still threw one heater or the other 75 out of every 100 pitches. If it works, the old parlance goes, it works.\"Suarez, 34, for his career boasts an ERA+ of 141 with an FIP of 3.36 across parts of four MLB seasons, all with the Padres. His 40 saves in 2025 led the National League. In all, the two-time All-Star has struck out 219 batters in 210 career innings. In Atlanta, Raisel Iglesias, who re-signed on a one-year, $16 million deal earlier this winter, figures to get most of the save opportunities, while Suarez will primarily work as a high-leverage setup man, according to the Athletic. Skubal probably on the move?When it comes to repeat American League Cy Young winner Tarik Subal of the Detroit Tigers, trade speculation has been consistent heading into his walk year of 2026 and with no discernible progress made on an extension. On that front, a Skubal trade this offseason is increasingly seen as likely, reports ESPN's Jorge Castillo. \nNeedless to say, such a trade would be the biggest move of the winter in light of Skubal's present level of dominance: \nThose numbers are right in line with what he did in 2024, and the 29-year-old left-hander has the best-in-class stuff to back it up. It goes without saying that any team with any hope of contention in 2026 can use a pitcher of Skubal's rare caliber. That includes, first and foremost, the Tigers, who have logged back-to-back plate appearances. Even so, lead exec Scott Harris may decide he'd rather get a haul now than see Skubal walk at season's end. Cubs getting trade interest in HoernerThe Chicago Cubs are presumably aiming to return to the playoffs again in 2026, which means it would make little sense to trade standout second baseman Nico Hoerner. Hoerner's just 28 and signed through next season at bargain rates. He's also a two-time Gold Glove winner who over the past four seasons has stacked up a total WAR of 19.6. That's not the kind of player a serious team trades away. Still, Hoerner's name has indeed come up in trade conversations with the Cubs, according to the Athletic. Presumably, the Cubs would entertain offers for Hoerner only if it addressed current roster needs elsewhere, but who's to say in light of the listless stewardship of the Ricketts family. \nYankees possibly entertaining Jazz trade talkSpeaking of contenders getting asks on core players, the Yankees have at least indulged inquiries about the trade status of infielder Jazz Chisholm Jr, ESPN reports. Chisholm was a core member of the Yanks last season, as he had an OPS+ of 125 and a WAR of 4.2 in his first full season in the Bronx, and profiles as key piece moving forward. He's 27 and headed into his third and final year of arbitration eligibility in 2026. Payroll of course should not be a concern for the Yankees, but owner Hal Streinbrenner has been reluctant to put the full power of the club's resources into the on-field product. As such, the Chisholm discussions, to whatever extent they're serious, may be viewed as partial salary offsets for moves later in the offseason. Boras pitching Bregman to MarinersStandout infielder Alex Bregman remains on the free-agent market after a strong 2025 season with the Red Sox: \nHe's a three-time All-Star who's still operating at the top of his game and the Red Sox are by all accounts interested in bringing him back. As well, the Cubs and Tigers have also been connected to Bregman and agent Scott Boras is of course busy angling to drum up more interest in one of his marquee clients. Speaking of which, here's this from Adam Jude of the Seattle Times: \n\"Mega agent Scott Boras, representing Alex Bregman, the top free-agent third baseman on the market, has initiated discussions with the Mariners to express Bregman's willingness to consider Seattle as a destination, an industry source told The Times.\"The interest may not be entirely mutual, as the M's are more likely to go with an internal solution at the hot corner next season or add to the infield via trade. No doubt, though, the presence of Bregman would significantly improve Seattle's outlook in 2026 and beyond. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Fittingly, the Pittsburgh Steelers are two wins away from breaking a record that they currently share with a franchise that they have long been linked to. The Steelers are closing in on setting a new NFL record for the most consecutive non-losing seasons in NFL history. They currently share the record with the Dallas Cowboys, their opponent in three previous Super Bowls. Actually, the Steelers beat the Cowboys in two Super Bowls during Dallas' 20-year run without a losing season. Pittsburgh recorded a 21-17 win in Super Bowl X before winning the rematch three years later in the first Super Bowl ever played between two franchises that had already each won the big game twice.Most consecutive non-losing seasons in NFL history FranchiseSeasonsYearsChampionships wonT1Pittsburgh Steelers212004-Present2T1Dallas Cowboys 211965-8523New England Patriots 19 2001-186T4Oakland Raiders161965-802T4San Francisco 49ers 161983-9866Chicago Bears 151930-445Steelers coach Mike Tomlin is two wins away from recording his 19th consecutive non-losing season, which would tie him with former Patriots coach Bill Belichick for second all-time behind Tom Landry, who was the Cowboys' coach throughout the team's 20-year non-losing streak. Most consecutive non-losing seasons for an NFL coach CoachSeasonsYearsChampionships1Tom Landry (Cowboys)201965-8522Bill Belichick (Patriots)192001-1863Mike Tomlin (Steelers)182007-2414George Halas (Bears)161933-42; 1946-5145Marty Schottenheimer (Browns/Chiefs)141984-870The Steelers' current streak started in 2004, when they won a franchise-record 15 regular season games. That season also saw Ben Roethlisberger win each of his first 13 career starts, an NFL record. \"It legitimized the fact that we can play with the big boys,\" former Steelers safety Troy Polamalu once said of the '04 Steelers. \"Midway through the season, we had beaten two unbeaten teams, which were Philadelphia and New England. ... Philadelphia had Terrell Owens, who was extremely talented, and Donovan McNabb. Obviously, everybody knows that Tom Brady is a pretty good quarterback as well (laughs) that we lost to (in the AFC Championship Game). \"That year was a very significant year because we [realized] we were good enough to play with everybody.\"The following season, the Steelers became the first six seed to win the Super Bowl after they defeated the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XL. That would be the second-to-last season on the sideline for Hall of Fame coach Bill Cowher, whose 15 seasons with the Steelers included tying Paul Brown's record by leading Pittsburgh to the playoffs in each of his first six seasons as coach. Pittsburgh continued its success upon Tomlin's arrival in 2007. The Steelers won the AFC North title that year before capturing the franchise's sixth Super Bowl title in 2008 after defeating the Arizona Cardinals in Super Bowl XLIII. In 2010, the Steelers reached the Super Bowl again before falling to Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers. In 2011, the Steelers lost to Tim Tebow and the Denver Broncos in the AFC wild-card round in what is considered one of the most shocking playoff losses in franchise history. What followed were consecutive 8-8 seasons as many of the central figures on Pittsburgh's championship teams began to depart. Behind an explosive offense, the Steelers enjoyed a successful four-year run from 2014-17 that included three division titles, four consecutive playoff berths and the franchise's most recent AFC Championship Game appearance at the end of the 2016 season. In 2017, the Steelers went 13-3 before suffering another upset loss in the playoffs, this time at the hands of the Jacksonville Jaguars. After closing the 2010s with two non-playoff seasons, the Steelers made the playoffs four times over a five-year span from 2020-24. But while they've continued to remain competitive, Pittsburgh has yet to win a playoff game since defeating the Chiefs in the 2016 divisional round. That drought has, in some people's eyes, diminished the team's record of non-losing seasons. Here are some of the essential figures during the Steelers' recent run:Former head coach Bill CowherCurrent head coach Mike TomlinFormer general manager Kevin ColbertLate owner Dan RooneyHis son and current team president Art Rooney IIFormer defensive coordinator Dick LeBeauTwo-time Super Bowl champion Ben RoethlisbergerPro Football Hall of Fame safety and 2010 NFL Defensive Player of the Year Troy Polamalu2008 NFL Defensive Player of the Year James Harrison 2021 NFL Defensive Player of the Year T.J.

They are hoping to cap off the regular season with their first division title since 2020, which would lead to the franchise's first home playoff game in five years.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The holidays are upon us, and the next gift is a battle of NFC heavyweights in the NFL's third annual Black Friday contest. Except the Chicago Bears and Philadelphia Eagles, who will square off at Lincoln Financial Field, are in much different places.Few expected Chicago to be 8-3 after Thanksgiving, even with an anticipated boost under the direction of new coach Ben Johnson. In fact, plenty of Bears players are probably just as surprised about the team's standing, considering how many of Windy City's victories have come as a result of last-minute heroics.The Eagles are also 8-3, which isn't a surprising record for the reigning Super Bowl champions. But that record might also be a bit deceiving: While Vic Fangio's defense has remained stingy, allowing barely 20 points per game, the Birds' big-name offense is producing below its paygrade, with the once-vaunted O-line struggling to clear running lanes for Saquon Barkley.As both the Bears and Eagles survive on the margins, which side is due for victory on Friday? It's a must-see matchup either way.\nBet Eagles vs. Bears at Bet365 Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets using the bonus code CBSBET365:Here's everything you need to know to catch the Black Friday showdown, including key matchups and our prediction:Where to watch Eagles vs. Bears liveDate: Friday, Nov. 28 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Lincoln Financial Field (Philadelphia)Stream: Prime Video*Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Eagles -7, O/U 44.5 (via DraftKings Sportsbook)*Note: This Prime Video broadcast is free; it does not require an Amazon Prime subscription, just an Amazon account.\nKey questions\n                                                                    Imagn Images\n                                                            Can Saquon Barkley finally break free? Very little is going right for the reigning Offensive Player of the Year. Not only is the running back's formerly dominant line struggling to meet expectations, with Lane Johnson banged up and fellow lynchpins like Cam Jurgens and Landon Dickerson losing ground, but Barkley himself seems to lack some of the pre-contact burst that made him a monster in 2024. Perhaps this is just the defense he needs to face, as Chicago's linebacker corps is all bruised up, and Dennis Allen's unit, though opportunistic with an NFL-leading 24 takeaways, ranks 28th in run defense.How will Ben Johnson attack the Eagles' secondary? Caleb Williams has been a bit scattershot as the Bears' signal-caller, but one thing he's done well is control the ball, with just four interceptions on the year. This might be the time Johnson lets Williams air it out, however, with Philly in the middle of another cornerback shuffle. Adoree' Jackson is banged up on the outside, and both Reed Blankenship and Andrew Mukuba are also hurt at safety, leaving the Eagles vulnerable against the deep ball.Can Philly's front fluster Caleb Williams? Again, Williams has done a decent job protecting the rock even while the Bears have endured streaky stretches as an offense. But if there's one thing the Eagles defense does well, it's disrupt in the trenches, with freakish front-seven standouts like Jalen Carter and Zack Baun always around the ball. The last time Chicago faced a top-10 defense according to DVOA grades, the Bears struggled mightily to keep up with the rival Detroit Lions.You can bet Eagles vs. Bears at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:X factor to watch\nTwo years after logging his first career 1,000-yard rushing season as the No. 1 back for the Eagles, Swift will be back in Philly as part of a hit-or-miss Bears tandem. While rookie Kyle Monangai may be Chicago's new \"finisher\" and/or top overall ball carrier, Swift remains a home run threat with top-end breakaway burst. And the Eagles have proven vulnerable when defending the run, allowing Javonte Williams and Malik Davis to gain 111 combined yards in the Dallas Cowboys' Week 12 comeback win. It wouldn't be a shock if Ben Johnson tries to scheme up open-field opportunities for Swift to stretch the field against his old team.Prediction\nThe Bears just keep finding ways to win. Which is kind of what we usually say about the Eagles. So which team is for real? Which one has a more authentic 8-3 mark going into Black Friday's showdown? Forgive us if we tend to side with the defending champs.\nChicago is no doubt proving scrappy under Johnson's watch, and if Dennis Allen's defense can find a way to force a loose ball against the Birds as the Cowboys did, well, we could be in for a real stunner at the Linc. The injuries at the back end of the Eagles' own defense aren't anything to overlook, either.All that said, there's still a clear disparity in top-end talent when you put these teams head to head. If Jalen Hurts, A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith can't gut one out at home against this group, even on a short week after a tough divisional loss, then it'll really be time to sound the alarms in Philadelphia. Or just put some genuine respect on the Bears' name.Pick: Eagles 27, Bears 17 | Eagles -7, Under 44.5\n            ",

It has Dak Prescott and the Dallas Cowboys hosting Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce and the Kansas City Chiefs. Dallas (5-5-1) is coming off 24-21 comeback victory over Philadelphia on Sunday, and the Cowboys are 34-22-1 all-time on Thanksgiving. Kansas City (6-5) toppled Indianapolis, 23-20, in Week 12 and will be part of the NFL Thanksgiving tradition for the first time since 2006, going 5-5 all-time on Turkey Day. RB Isiah Pacheco (knee) will return for Kansas City, while Cowboys OL Tyler Guyton (ankle) is out.Kickoff is from AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, at 4:30 p.m. ET on CBS and Paramount+.

Kareem Hunt ran for over 100 yards versus what was the No. 5 run defense, while Indy's Jonathan Taylor -- who leads the NFL in both rushing yards and touchdowns -- was held to just 58 yards on the ground and kept out of the endzone. As for Mahomes, the native Texan should relish his first pro game in Dallas as he gets to face the Cowboys' No. 30 pass defense as the Chiefs look to improve to 4-1 ATS versus NFC opponents this year. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why the Cowboys can coverIt's been over 50 years since the Chiefs won in Dallas, as the Cowboys have prevailed in their last five home games versus Kansas City. Additionally, the Cowboys have won three straight Thanksgiving Day games, with a 16.7-point average margin of victory in them. Despite Andy Reid, Mahomes and Kelce being on the other sideline, it's the Cowboys who will have the best offense on the field as they rank first in yards and fourth in scoring. Additionally, the Cowboys should be able to take advantage of a team which has gotten a little sloppy as of late as the Chiefs have as many turnovers (six) over their last four games as they had over their previous 18 regular season games. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Cowboys vs. Chiefs picksFor the NFL Week 13 game of Chiefs vs. Cowboys, the model is leaning Under the total.

Only one of the Eagles' eight wins has been by more than 7, so all we're asking here is for Ben Johnson to do as good a job as most teams have against Philly this year to keep this a one-score game.\"Over 44.5 pointsBen Johnson has proven he was ready for the big chair as an NFL head coach, as the former standout Lions offensive coordinator is leading another elite offensive unit in the NFC North. The Bears are eighth in the league in scoring offense at 26.3 points per game. The defense has struggled, though, ranking 27th at 26.5 ppg allowed this year. The Eagles' offense is one of the most perplexing aspects about the 2025 NFL season, as the unit is filled with star power such as Jalen Hurts, Saquon Barkley, A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith, yet it ranks in the middle of the league in scoring at 23.2 ppg, which is 17th. The Bears' defense could be what the Eagles need to break out, though. The model projects the Over to hit in 55% of simulations.Responsible gamingResponsible gaming is a serious topic, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users play responsibly.

    "body": "\n        Outside of Super Bowl Sunday, Thanksgiving is arguably the day most synonymous with football, and the NFL made sure to schedule three mouthwatering matchups. The Thanksgiving NFL schedule begins with the Detroit Lions (7-4) hosing the Green Bay Packers (7-3-1) in an NFC North battle at 1 p.m. ET, followed by the Dallas Cowboys (5-5-1) hosting the Kansas City Chiefs (6-5) at 4:30 p.m. on CBS and Paramount+, before the Baltmore Ravens (6-5) host the Cincinnati Bengals (3-8) at 8:20 p.m. ET. All three games are sure to garner ample online sports betting interest. The highest over/under on Thanksgiving is 52.5 points in Chiefs vs. Cowboys. There are dozens of betting options if you're wondering how to bet on the NFL on Thanksgiving.

The Lions have lost seven of their last eight Thanksgiving games; however, Detroit did defeat Chicago, 23-20, on Thanksgiving last season. The Lions are coming off a 34-27 overtime victory over the Giants to improve to 7-4 overall and 4-1 at home this season. Jahmyr Gibbs rushed for 219 yards and two touchdowns and added 11 receptions for 45 yards and a score last week, as a nearly unstoppable weapon out of the backfield. He's averaging 113 rushing yards at home this season, and the model projects Gibbs to be a significant reason the Lions win and cover on Thanksgiving. The model projects the Lions to cover the spread in 52% of simulations.Chiefs vs. Cowboys betting preview, picksChiefs (-3) vs. CowboysThe Chiefs missing the playoffs flashed before the eyes of nearly everyone in America when seeing Kansas City trailing by 11 points in the fourth quarter last week and on the verge of falling to below .500 after 12 weeks. But rather unsurprisingly, given how dominant the Chiefs have been in recent seasons, Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reid didn't allow that to become a reality, completing the comeback and forcing overtime in an eventual 23-20 win over the Colts, who entered last week as one of only three teams in the AFC with two losses. Every game remains crucial to the Chiefs, who at 6-5 are far from certain to make the postseason, and they'll take on the 5-5-1 Cowboys. Dallas' defense has performed better since its trade deadline acquisitions, but overall, the Cowboys still rank 31st in scoring defense at 28.5 ppg allowed this season. With a national audience in what is likely to be the most-viewed regular-season game of the NFL season, the model expects the Chiefs to put on a show, projecting Kansas City to cover the spread in 54% of simulations.Bengals vs. Ravens betting preview, picksRavens (-7) vs. BengalsEven if Joe Burrow (toe) can take the field for the first time since Week 2, the main reason for the Bengals' 3-8 record this season remains unaffected. Cincinnati has the worst scoring defense in the NFL, allowing 32.7 ppg on an NFL-worst 415.8 yards per contest. The Bengals are 18th in scoring this season at 22.5 ppg, which is just below the NFL average. The Bengals averaged 27.2 ppg in Joe Flacco's six starts, which would rank seventh over the course of the whole season, and they still went 1-5 due to the abysmal Cincinnati defense. With a matchup against Lamar Jackson, Derrick Henry and Zay Flowers ahead, the model does not project this to go well for the Bengals' defense, and it will be difficult for whoever Cincinnati's QB1 is to keep pace with what the 'D' allows. The model projects the Ravens to cover in 54% of simulations. Responsible gamingResponsible gaming is a serious topic, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users play responsibly.

    "body": "\n        We hope you all had a fantastic Thanksgiving, and enjoyed all of the football. We saw Jordan Love and the Green Bay Packers upset the Detroit Lions, Dak Prescott and the Dallas Cowboys sent the Kansas City Chiefs back to .500, and Joe Burrow's had a triumphant return to the field. This week in the NFL, the Houston Texans look to make up ground on the Indianapolis Colts in the AFC South, the Buffalo Bills look to get back on track vs. the Pittsburgh Steelers and Shedeur Sanders makes his second NFL start against a Robert Saleh-led defense. Let's jump into it. Here's a look at what I'm thinking this week. As always, credit to the CBS Sports research team for making me sound smart. Odds courtesy of FanDuel SportsbookTop five picks ATS record: 29-30-1Overall ATS record: 95-82-1Straight up record: 123-54-1\nChicago Bears at Philadelphia Eagles (-7)Friday, 3 p.m. ET (Amazon Prime)\nThe Bears are 8-1 in their past nine games after starting the season 0-2, but I think it's fair to say they are a bit overrated. Chicago is just the third team in NFL history to start 8-3 or better with a negative point differential, and six of its eight wins have come by five or fewer points. Still, they are competitive. There's no arguing that. Plus, Caleb Williams is getting better, and has accounted for nine total touchdowns compared to zero interceptions during this current four-game win streak. The Eagles on the other hand just blew a 21-point lead to the rival Cowboys, which is tied for the largest blown lead by a defending Super Bowl champion all time. While A.J. Brown had a 110-yard outing on Sunday, I don't like that DeVonta Smith is going to miss this matchup with shoulder and chest injuries, plus an illness. He's the Eagles' leading receiver this year with 754 yards on 55 catches. The Bears have four outright wins as an underdog during this current 8-1 stretch. I'm not sure I'm bold enough to take the Bears straight up, but I will take the +7. \nThe pick: Bears +7Projected score: Eagles 24-20San Francisco 49ers (-5) at Cleveland BrownsSunday, 1 p.m. ET (CBS, Stream on Paramount+)\nI feel left out not having strong feelings for Shedeur Sanders, whether those feelings be of hate or love, but I of course am intrigued by the most polarizing player in the NFL. I don't think his first NFL start vs. the Las Vegas Raiders was fantastic by any means, but I do think he looked better than Dillon Gabriel. That's probably why Kevin Stefanski is moving forward with him. Now, the Browns will hold the most highly-anticipated home game in quite some time.There's reason to be worried about the 49ers right now. Obviously the defense isn't as good as we're used to, plus Brock Purdy threw three first-half interceptions against the Carolina Panthers of all teams. Now, he has to hit the road to take on one of the best defenses in the NFL that will be absolutely JUICED to play. Give me the Browns to keep it close.  The pick: Browns +5Projected score: 49ers 17-13Minnesota Vikings at Seattle Seahawks (-11.5)Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET (Fox, Stream: Fubo, try for free)\nThe Seahawks burned me last week by allowing a late touchdown against the Tennessee Titans, but I'm going to give them another shot with a big spread here. Seattle is back at home, and hosting a flailing Vikings team that is expected to start rookie undrafted free agent Max Brosmer at quarterback. This is a frightening situation for the 4-7 Vikings. \nThe pick: Seahawks -11.5Projected score: Seahawks 30-10Las Vegas Raiders at Los Angeles Chargers (-9.5)Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET (CBS, Stream on Paramount+)\nThe Raiders stink, and I don't think firing Chip Kelly fixes all of their issues. Vegas has now lost five straight games, and three of those losses have come by at least 14 points. The Chargers beat the Raiders in Vegas earlier this season, 20-9, when Justin Herbert was looking like an MVP candidate. Yes, there are concerns about the offensive line, but L.A. had the bye week to reset. The Chargers are a tough team to figure out. They will blow out the Pittsburgh Steelers, 25-10, and then get obliterated, 35-6, by the Jacksonville Jaguars a week later. I don't think the Chargers are some super team, but I have them winning by double digits on Sunday.  The pick: Chargers -9.5Projected score: Chargers 27-17Denver Broncos (-5.5) at Washington CommandersSunday, 8:20 p.m. ET (NBC, Stream: Fubo, try for free)\nMarcus Mariota has lost four straight starts, while Washington has lost six straight. Now, the Commanders have to face off against one of the best defenses in the NFL in prime time. Denver leads the league in sacks, quarterback hits, third-down conversion percentage, red-zone touchdown percentage and yards per play entering Week 13, while Washington's defense ranks second worst in the NFL. The Commanders haven't covered the spread since Week 5, so give me the Broncos with the number under a touchdown.\nThe pick: Broncos -5.5Projected score: Broncos 23-10Other Week 13 picksPackers (+2.5) 24-21 over LionsCowboys (+3.5) 30-27 over ChiefsRavens 23-21 over Bengals (+7.5)Rams (-10.5) 31-20 over PanthersBuccaneers (-2.5) 23-20 over CardinalsJaguars (-6.5) 24-17 over TitansDolphins (-5.5) 24-13 over SaintsJets (+2.5) 20-18 over FalconsColts 23-20 over Texans (+3.5)Bills (-3.5) 23-17 over SteelersPatriots 27-20 over Giants (+7.5)\n            ",

On Thursday, the New York Giants announced that their rookie quarterback had officially cleared the concussion protocol, meaning he could be back in the starting lineup when the Giants take on the New England Patriots in Foxborough, Massachusetts, this week on \"Monday Night Football.\" Dart has missed the last two games with a concussion he suffered against the Chicago Bears in Week 10, which was Brian Daboll's final contest as the Giants coach. Interim coach Mike Kafka made the decision to start Jameis Winston in Dart's place, and while the former No. 1 overall pick did bring a spark to New York's offense, he couldn't bring any wins. The 2-10 Giants have lost six straight games, and became the first team to be officially eliminated from playoff contention last week. Dart is 2-5 as the starter this season, and has completed 62.7% of his passes for 1,417 yards, 10 touchdowns and three interceptions in nine total games played. The first-round pick out of Ole Miss has made a major impact with his legs, rushing 57 times for 317 yards and seven touchdowns. Dart has rushed for a touchdown in five consecutive games, which is the longest streak by any rookie quarterback since 1970. \nThe Giants are still searching for their first road win this year. New York is 0-7 away from MetLife Stadium this season despite holding double-digit leads in five of those seven games.  \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        In their 31-24 loss to the Green Bay Packers on Thanksgiving, the Detroit Lions lost star receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown to an ankle injury on just the fourth offensive play of the game. St. Brown was ruled out after halftime, and according to coach Dan Campbell, he will miss some time.Campbell said in his postgame press conference that, while St. Brown may have avoided a lengthy absence, team doctors expect the standout pass catcher to be sidelined for multiple weeks.\"I'll know more tomorrow,\" Campbell said. \"I don't feel like this is long-long-term. That's the good news, but it could be a week or two, maybe, if we're lucky.\"On the game's second drive, St. Brown was rolled up from behind while blocking on a run play. He remained on the turf for a few minutes while he was evaluated by trainers. Eventually, St. Brown got up and walked off the field, straight to the locker room. He was initially listed as questionable to return, only to be officially ruled out in the third quarter.\nIn 11 games this season, St. Brown has caught 75 passes for 884 yards and nine touchdowns. The Lions on Sunday were already playing without tight end Sam LaPorta, who was placed on injured reserve earlier this month with a back injury, and wide receiver Kalif Raymond, who was inactive with an ankle injury.Dan Campbell will call upon Jameson Williams, Tom Kennedy, plus rookies Isaac TeSlaa and Dominic Lovett, to potentially step up in St. Brown's absence.\nWith St. Brown out of the lineup, the Lions have some work to do if they're going to climb the NFC North standings down the stretch. Now 7-5, Detroit sits third in the NFC North, looking up at the Green Bay Packers and Chicago Bears. Over the next two weeks, the Lions get crucial NFC clashes against the Dallas Cowboys and Los Angeles Rams. Those games will be major tests, especially if St. Brown is sidelined.\n            ",

The Beavers are targeting Alabama assistant head coach JaMarcus Shephard, according to CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz.Shephard has been at Alabama since joining Kalen DeBoer's staff in 2024. Over the last two seasons, Shephard has served as the Crimson Tide's assistant head coach, co-offensive coordinator and wide receivers coach.This season, Shephard has helped build an offense that ranks 25th in the country in points per game at 33.8 and ninth in passing yards per game at 292.5. The offense has been humming for much of the season, and quarterback Ty Simpson has had a breakout campaign. Shephard will try to bring some of that magic with him to Corvallis.\nPrior to his tenure in Tuscaloosa, Shephard was with DeBoer at Washington, where he worked as the assistant head coach, passing game coordinator and wide receivers coach.After to playing college football at DePauw, Shephard began his coaching career at Northrop High School in Indiana. From there, he worked his way up through the ranks with stops at Western Kentucky, Washington State and Purdue.\nShephard will lead Oregon State into the new Pac-12, which will begin with the 2026 season and includes programs like Boise State and Colorado State. Shephard replaces former coach Trent Bray, who went 5-14 in 19 games.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        No. 2 South Carolina and No. 4 Texas are facing off in the inaugural women's basketball Players Era championship game on Thursday. The game is a rematch from the 2025 Final Four. Later on Thanksgiving, No. 3 UCLA and Duke will battle it out in the third-place game.Texas earned its spot with a 76-65 win against UCLA on Wednesday. The Longhorns were missing Aaliyah Crump and Bryanna Preston due to injury, but they still got their biggest win of the season so far. Their defense was visibly disrupting for the Bruins, who ended the night with 20 turnovers. Rori Harmon led Texas' offense with 26 points, and her overall performance led coach Vic Schaefer to say this game showed why she is \"the best point guard in the country.\"\nSouth Carolina picked up a 83-66 win against Duke, a team that is currently out of the AP Top 25 but was ranked in the top 10 during preseason. The Blue Devils kept it close early in the game, but South Carolina got the job done with Joyce Edwards and Madina Okot scoring a combined 45 points. Okot also completed a double-double with 13 rebounds. Just like in the men's tournament, which expanded to 18 teams this year, each participating is set to receive $1 million in NIL money. The players get all the money, which means each of them will receive around $75,000. Other than the money, the elite lineup is a great opportunity for the teams to test themselves against top competition early in the season. Founders of the event also believe this is an opportunity to get a brighter spotlight on college basketball during the fall.\n\"College basketball has always started in November. But let's give it more,\" Players Era co-founder Seth Berger told CBS Sports. \"Let's give everyone a reason to watch, not just the most hardcore of the fans. So first and foremost, I thought there was an opportunity to create a great American sporting event, a tentpole event in November.\" Women's Player Era schedule, scoresAll times are Eastern\nWednesday, Nov. 26No. 4 Texas 76, No. 3 UCLA 65No. 2 South Carolina 83, Duke 66Thursday, Nov. 27No. 2 South Carolina vs. No. 4 Texas (Championship game) | 8 p.m. | TruTV/HBO MaxDuke vs. No. 3 UCLA (Third-place game) | 10:30 p.m. | TruTV/HBO MaxTexas vs. South Carolina predictionThese are two teams that pride themselves on defense, so I think this game will come down to who can find, and keep, momentum on offense. While both programs worked on getting stronger in this area during the summer and added valuable weapons, Texas probably had the most dramatic improvement since their Final Four meeting (a 17-point South Carolina win). The Longhorns made six 3-pointers against UCLA, which is not a particularly high number, but they did it without Aaliyah Crump and this was also not at all their forte last season. I like the overall potential we are seeing from Texas, especially with how quickly they adjusted with injuries ahead of this tournament. Although this is not an easy decision because South Carolina is always a dangerous opponent, the Longhorns already made a statement in Las Vegas with how they handled a very good UCLA team. Pick: Texas\n            ",

    "body": "\n        For months, Cincinnati Bengals fans have been holding out hope for Joe Burrow's return. Now, in Week 13, those hopes are set to be realized, with the star quarterback expected to make his anticipated return against the rival Baltimore Ravens.In theory, Burrow's return couldn't come at a more perfect time. The Bengals are undeniably desperate, looking to avoid their fifth straight loss after dropping eight of nine contests since Burrow's exit, and yet the AFC North race is far from over. The Ravens are technically on top at 6-5, but their own signal-caller, Lamar Jackson, hardly looks himself. And the division's second-place squad, the Pittsburgh Steelers, are no firmer thanks to a streaky defense and banged-up Aaron Rodgers.Yet if the Bengals couldn't even win while Burrow's emergency fill-in, Joe Flacco, enjoyed big-play production earlier this year, should we really expect a different outcome for Cincinnati on Thursday night? Either way, the third and final matchup of this year's 2025 Thanksgiving slate is must-see material.Bet Ravens vs. Bengals at Bet365 Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets using the bonus code CBSBET365:Here's everything you need to know to catch Bengals-Ravens on Turkey Day, including key matchups and our prediction:\nWhere to watch Ravens vs. Bengals liveDate: Thursday, Nov. 27 | Time: 8:20 p.m. ETLocation: M&T Bank Stadium (Baltimore)TV: NBCFollow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Ravens -7, O/U 51.5 (via DraftKings Sportsbook)Key questions\n                                                                    Imagn Images\n                                                            How ready is Joe Burrow, really? Coach Zac Taylor insists his quarterback is \"in good shape\" after a nine-game absence. It helps Burrow also got some practice reps in ahead of the Bengals' last game. Still, the Pro Bowler is returning earlier than initially expected from a severe turf toe injury, and we just saw in San Francisco, with Brock Purdy, what can happen when recovery timelines are rushed. Up against an improved Ravens defense on a short week, this profiles as a tall task for No. 9.Can the Bengals slow Derrick Henry? The Ravens' star running back has been much more erratic this year than last, but he's helped carry Baltimore's grind-it-out attack since Lamar Jackson's return from injury, including with three touchdowns over the last two weeks. After mustering just 3 yards per carry against the New York Jets, this could be just the matchup for him to find daylight, as the Bengals are surrendering 156 rushing yards per game, which is ranked 31st in the entire NFL.Can Ja'Marr Chase single-handedly outrace Baltimore's secondary? The Ravens were surprisingly docile on defense to open the year, but they've tightened up since mid-October, allowing 17 or more points just once during their five-game win streak. Chase is arguably the NFL's top playmaker out wide, especially when Burrow is feeding him downfield opportunities, but he's coming off a one-game suspension and will be without top running mate Tee Higgins, who's sidelined with a concussion.You can bet Ravens vs. Bengals at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:X factor to watch\nOnce a ball-hawking member of the Ravens' secondary, Stone is coming off his splashiest outing of the 2025 campaign in Cincinnati, logging a pick six against Drake Maye and the New England Patriots to help the Bengals flirt with an upset. Practicing against Lamar Jackson and Co. for his first four NFL seasons might give Stone at least some advantage going into this matchup. But Jackson's recent inefficiencies as a passer might be the best thing working in Stone's favor; let's say Lamar gets a little too impatient while seeking the big play for Baltimore, giving his old friend a chance to steal a possession for the Bengals.Prediction\nIt's true that even when Flacco was dealing as Burrow's replacement, the Bengals failed miserably in other facets, be it situational coaching or general defensive competence. But there might be something to the notion that Burrow's return will put a little extra pep in everyone's step. The Ravens' own scattershot offense is another reason to believe this could be a pristine night for Burrow and Chase to reestablish their home run connection and throw another wrench into an already messy AFC North tangle.That said, we hesitate to put too much trust into a Zac Taylor-led operation that's routinely struggled to look prepared, and Higgins' absence should allow Baltimore to really hone in on lessening Chase's impact. There's also the distinct possibility of Jackson rediscovering his own juice as a rusher, with the bruising Henry by his side, against such a porous run \"D\" in Cincy. We anticipate some holiday fireworks before the buzzer, but give us the home team to scrape one out on Thanksgiving night.\nPick: Ravens 26, Bengals 22 | Bengals +7, Under 51.5\n            ",

    "body": "\n        CINCINNATI -- After missing two months due to injury, Joe Burrow finally made his return to the field on Thursday night and he stole the show in Baltimore. The Bengals quarterback threw for 261 yards and two touchdowns in a shocking 32-14 win over the Ravens.It was such a dominant win that the rest of the Bengals' season just got very interesting. At 4-8, the Bengals' playoff hopes are on life support, but if anyone can save the team it's Burrow. The Bengals quarterback has now gone almost a full year without losing a game. Since Week 14 of the 2024 season, the Bengals have gone 8-0 with Burrow as their starter, including Thursday's win over the Ravens. If that run can continue, Cincinnati could end up pulling off one of the most improbable playoff berths in NFL history. With just five games left to play in the season, Burrow fully realizes that there's no margin for error going forward. \n\"It's no secret that every game from here on out is basically a must win, especially in the division,\" Burrow told NBC following the Bengals' win. \"It was great to get this one, coming off a short week.\"As things stand now, the Bengals have a 2.2% chance of making the postseason, according to the odds from SportsLine. If the Bengals are going to make the playoffs, they really only have one option: They have to win the AFC North.\nFor most 4-8 teams, the idea of winning the division is laughable, but luckily for the Bengals, the AFC North has turned into the division that no one wants to win this year. The Bengals were 4-8 at one point last year before running off five straight wins to end the season, so the team certainly knows what it takes to get hot. So what would have to happen for the Bengals to steal the division title? Let's take a look at the most plausible scenario, but first, let's check out the division standings. \nAFC North StandingsOverall recordDivision recordConference recordSteelers6-52-15-2Ravens6-62-14-4Bengals4-83-14-4Browns3-80-42-6The Steelers are in first place at 6-5, but they play the Bills on Sunday, and if they lose that game, they'll fall into a tie at 6-6 with the Ravens. At that point, the Bengals would be just two games out of first place. It won't be easy, but here's the most plausible scenario that would end with the Bengals winning the division. BENGALSRemaining opponents: at Bills (Win), Ravens (Win), Dolphins (Win), Cardinals (Win), Browns (Win)What has to happen: This one is easy, the Bengals have to run the table and win their final five games. Final record: 9-8, 5-1 in divisionRAVENSRemaining opponents: Steelers (Win), at Bengals (Loss), Patriots (Loss), at Packers (Win), at Steelers (Win)What has to happen: The Bengals need the Ravens to go 3-2 (or worse) over their final five games. Since the Bengals have to sweep the Ravens, that means that Cincinnati only needs Baltimore to lose one other game on the schedule, so let's say they lose to the Patriots. We also have the Ravens splitting their two games with the Steelers. Final record: 9-8, 4-2 in divisionSTEELERSRemaining opponents: Bills (Loss), at Ravens (Loss), Dolphins (Win), at Lions (Loss), at Browns (Win), Ravens (Win)What has to happen: The Steelers have a brutal schedule down the stretch, so it's not totally unrealistic to see them going 3-3 down the stretch. They're an underdog to the Bills and they'll likely be an underdog to the Lions. If they lose both of those games and split with the Ravens, that will put them at 9-8. Final record: 9-8, 4-2 in divisionLike I said at the top, there's only a 2% chance of the Bengals getting into the playoffs, so please cue the Lloyd Christmas meme. \nBurrow led the Bengals to a 2-0 record to start the season before missing nine games due to a turf toe injury and the team went just 1-8 in his absence. The Bengals star quarterback was originally expected to return in mid-December, but he defied the odds by making an early return, and now he'll be looking to defy the odds once again by leading the Bengals to an improbable playoff berth. He got the first win out of the way on Thanksgiving night, and now, he just needs to win the Bengals to five more. \n            ",

On his third carry of the night, Henry passed NFL legend Jim Brown on the all-time career rushing list. Henry entered the game with 12,294 yards across 10 NFL seasons. Brown, who retired after the 1965 season as the NFL's all-time rushing leader, ran for 12,312 yards during his nine-year Hall of Fame career. Henry passed Brown on a 28-yard touchdown run that capped off Baltimore's first drive. \nEarlier this season, Henry became only the 17th player of the 12,000-yard club, which is especially notable as every eligible member of that club is in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He also recently passed Hall of Famer Walter Payton for fifth all time in career touchdown runs. \nNFL all-time career rushing list PlayerYards1. Emmitt Smith**18,3552. Walter Payton**16,7263.

Steven Jackson11,43820. John Riggins**11,352** -- Pro Football Hall of Fame members Henry passing Brown is notable history indeed. Brown, who in 1964 led the Browns to their most recent NFL title, was the league's career rushing leader at the time of his retirement despite playing only nine seasons. In those nine seasons, he won a whopping eight rushing titles in addition to being an eight-time All-Pro and three-time league MVP. \nWhile rubbing shoulders with some of the greatest running backs is history, Henry also makes a case as the best running back of his generation. A five-time Pro Bowl player, Henry is just one of nine players to rush for over 2,000 yards in a season. Last year, his first with the Ravens, Henry led the NFL in rushing touchdowns for a third time while setting the single-season record for rushing yards gained by a player over the age of 30. \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

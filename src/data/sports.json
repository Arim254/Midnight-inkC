    "body": "\n        The Indiana Fever's 2025 season was one for the history books. In one of the most noteworthy chapters, key free agent signing DeWanna Bonner mysteriously left the team with no explanation, then signed with the Phoenix Mercury after she was waived. In a new interview with Glamour, Fever guard Lexie Hull shared that Bonner's unexplained departure initially hurt but ultimately brought the team together. \"I was super, super, super excited because finally there's a [player in my position] that I can look up to that has won in the league and has all these accomplishments and knows what it takes, and I can learn something from her,\" Hull said of Bonner. \"And then she randomly leaves, and we're all just kind of like, 'What happened?' We were never given an explanation.\"Bonner moved into third place on the WNBA's all-time scoring list in her first game with the Fever, but aside from that moment, her first few weeks with the team were disappointing. Bonner looked nothing like her usual self on the offensive end and was benched after three games. \nIn mid-June, Bonner stepped away from the Fever for what the team called \"personal reasons.\" As her absence stretched to nearly two weeks, reports began to circulate that she had requested a trade. Eventually, the Fever waived Bonner on June 25. Bonner, who was loudly booed upon her return to Indianapolis, later told reporters that she \"wouldn't do anything differently.\" \"I think my journey is my journey, and I'm going to accept that,\" Bonner continued. \"It carried me to where I am now in Phoenix, and it happened that way for a reason.\"\nBonner's sudden departure came amid an injury-riddled season for the Fever. Star guard Caitlin Clark was limited to 13 games due to an array of lower-body injuries, and was one of five players, along with Chloe Bibby, Sydney Colson, Sophie Cunningham and Aari McDonald, who suffered season-ending injuries during the regular season. Damiris Dantas ended up missing the entire playoff run with a concussion and Kelsey Mitchell left the team's season-ending defeat with rhabdomyolysis. \"To have no explanation [for Bonner's departure] was really challenging, but I think that helped us grow closer together because we're like, 'All right, this is us. We're here. We're going to support each other. We're loving each other. We're going to fight for each other. We're not going to leave. We're in this together,'\" Hull said. The Fever didn't have a single starting lineup play more than nine games together and 18 different players appeared in at least one game. Despite so much upheaval, the team won five of its last seven games to not only secure a playoff spot but also move up to the No. 6 seed, then went on a stunning run to the semifinals. \nIn the semis, the Fever pushed the eventual champion Las Vegas Aces to overtime in the deciding Game 5. If not for Mitchell's early exit in that contest, they very well may have made the Finals. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Dallas Mavericks are off to a tough start to the 2025 season at 1-3, and no player has embodied the team's uneven first week more than rookie Cooper Flagg. Flagg's NBA baptism came at the hands of Victor Wembanyama in the opener, and after a pair of solid nights against Washington and Toronto, the No. 1 overall pick was given another welcome to the league moment by the reigning champion Thunder. Flagg scored just two points in 31 minutes of play on Monday night against OKC, going 1-for-9 from the field and not recording a single assist. Flagg was a -20 in his 31 minutes of play and found himself on the bench as Dallas tried to mount a fourth-quarter comeback. The rookie was seen with an ice pack on his left shoulder after getting banged up on a box out earlier in the game, but the decision for him not to close out the game was a coach's decision from Jason Kidd. \"It wasn't his night tonight,\" Kidd said, via ESPN. \"We're a team, and so we understand that the group that was out there put us in the position to win the game. He wasn't on the floor, but he was cheering for his teammates.\"\nFlagg, to his credit, didn't use his shoulder injury as an excuse, saying they'll get tests on it, but he thinks it's just sore, and didn't pout after getting left out of the late-game rotation. The rookie took it all in stride and understood why Kidd didn't put him back in down the stretch. \"The way the game was going, we had a group out there that was doing really well and was on a run, so I see where Coach was at with that,\" Flagg said. \"And I mean, I was flat. I wasn't myself. I wasn't impacting the game at a high level, wasn't doing the right stuff. So obviously, that's an easy decision for Coach. He was just out there trying to win the game.\"A rookie season is all about the learning experience. For all the talk coming into this season about Dallas being a great place for Flagg to develop in a winning environment, right now he's being placed in an incredibly uncomfortable, new position. Kidd has thrust the point guard role on him, not dissimilar to what he did with a young Giannis Antetokounmpo in Milwaukee, and while the idea is to build skills that make him a better playmaker and star later, in the immediate, there will be some serious growing pains. \nMonday night, we saw those growing pains in both a figurative and literal sense. Flagg's difficult night offensively was predictable against an elite Thunder defense on his first-ever NBA back-to-back. On top of that, he added a shoulder injury that no one seems to think is particularly severe, but was another reminder of the physicality and challenges of life in the NBA. \n            ",

After both pitching staffs were depleted on Monday night, we're not sure about either bullpen tonight, and Toronto's Shane Bieber did labor in Game 7 of the ALCS vs. Seattle.\" Back the Over at BetMGM Sportsbook now:76ers -3.5 vs. Wizards (-110)The Wizards went into the tank last season for Cooper Flagg and came up empty-handed. Now they've built a roster primarily full of players aged 22 or younger around veterans CJ McCollum and Khris Middleton, and they're likely to tank again with a deeper pool of prospects that include AJ Dybantsa, Darryn Peterson or Cam Boozer. Meanwhile, the 76ers are off to a 3-0 start despite Paul George being out and Joel Embiid playing severely restricted minutes. Tyrese Maxey and VJ Edgecombe appear to be the makings of a dynamic backcourt, as they're averaging 62.0 points per game combined thus far.

Last season, they went 36-6 in Oklahoma City and outscored opponents by 15.1 points on average, including a 34-point win at home against Sacramento. The Kings are 1-2 on the season and the model predicts that the Thunder cover the spread in 67% of simulations. Back the Thunder at BetMGM Sportsbook now:\nWant more NBA picks for this week?You've seen some of the model's best bets for Tuesday.

BYU and Cincinnati, who are 5-0 in Big 12 play, and No. 10 and No. 17 in the AP Poll, are 15th and 21st, respectively, in my power ratings. Houston is 29th. All of which means there's plenty of chaos coming the Big 12's direction over the final month plus of the season. The Utes don't have much chance of winning the league -- losses to Texas Tech and BYU kill them in most tie-breaker scenarios -- but they do get Cincinnati at home this week, so they'll certainly have a say in who will win the league.All of which is great news for the league as far as drama and excitement down the stretch. However, it does not bode well for how the league will perform in the College Football Playoff rankings, or its likely performance in said playoff.Odds via DraftKings Sportsbook\n2025 Preseason Fornelli Power Ratings1\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Ohio State\n                    \n    \n    The Buckeyes took the week off and return to action this week to face Penn State in what was supposed to be one of the biggest games of the season. Instead, Ohio State finds itself in a situation where anything other than a multi-score margin of victory will be seen as a disappointment.

The Hoosiers won by 50, proving once and for all that any team can lose by 50 on the road against Indiana, all right? I'm not just saying that as an Illini licking his wounds from a 17-point loss to Washington that ended the team's slim playoff hopes. Purely neutral observation!

Last year, the Ducks survived a 16-13 scare at Camp Randall, and on Saturday, they looked somewhat pedestrian in a 21-7 win over the Badgers. The weather clearly played a factor, but even if it forced the Ducks to be more one-dimensional on offense, I'd have liked to have seen a stronger overall performance.

First of all, it's a tough place to play. Second, the Tide were coming off a stretch of four straight games against ranked teams, including an annual rivalry tilt with Tennessee last week. This is a team that is really happy to get a bye this weekend.

I've already written it, but there's no reason this team shouldn't be looked at as a legitimate threat in both its conference and the CFP picture. I know they're fifth here, but the gap between them and the three teams ahead of them is not a significant one, which is why Oregon and Alabama keep doing their little dance of leapfrogging one another. A&M might jump both here soon.

BC's only win this season was against Fordham, and they've lost each of their last four games by at least 14 points. This is one of those games where Notre Dame can't just win, but has to do so impressively to make it worth something on the resume.

Why did Notre Dame jump ahead of Georgia when both had last week off? Because wins by Miami and Texas A&M improved Notre Dame's strength of schedule just enough to scoot the Irish past the Dawgs. SOS isn't part of my ratings directly, but it does affect how teams \"score\" in areas that are.

The Rebels dropped after losing to Georgia two weeks ago, but an eight-point win on the road against an Oklahoma team that was 11th here last week (and is still 14th this week) helps them climb up a spot. The most difficult stretch of the schedule is complete; now the Rebels just need to make sure they don't mess up more than once down the home stretch, and they'll make their first playoff appearance.

I considered downgrading Miami based on its uniform choice alone. You can honor the troops without dishonoring yourselves, Canes. Those things looked awful. Anyway, Miami won 42-7 against Stanford to bounce back from the Louisville loss, but there are still a few tricky games left on the schedule. November could be a breeze, but it could also be heartbreaking.

Yes, my tongue was planted semi-firmly in my cheek when I said Yormark should declare Tech the Big 12 champion two weeks ago and let the team rest to avoid injuries, but there is plenty of truth in sarcasm sometimes! Now the Red Raiders have a banged-up Behren Morton, and backup QB Will Hammond was lost for the season to a torn ACL. They're still without Skyler Gill-Howard on their defensive line, too. There's a legitimate chance this team doesn't get to the Big 12 Championship Game, and I don't see a 10-2 Tech team getting an at-large bid in most outcomes.

Byrd Ficklin -- what a damn name -- was the surprise starter for the Utes against Colorado, and nobody seemed more surprised by it than the Buffaloes. Ficklin rushed for 151 yards, threw for 140 and had 3 touchdowns in a 53-7 decimation of the Buffs. It was 43-0 at halftime! The losses to Texas Tech and BYU ruined Utah's hopes of making the playoff this year, but this team has finally begun playing like the team I thought it would be before the season.

Texas came back from a 17-point fourth-quarter deficit to force overtime and beat Mississippi State 45-38. Steve Sarkisian called it a \"culture win\" afterward, which I suppose is justified. You can argue that the team's culture is what kept it from giving up hope when down 17. However, if that's the case, does the culture not also take some of the blame for being down 17 points to Mississippi State to begin with? You know, a week after you needed overtime to beat Kentucky? The Horns can't keep getting away with this, yet they do.

    "body": "\n        Hall of Fame tight end Antonio Gates has denied any connection to mafia-linked rigged poker games following recent reports suggesting his involvement. The statement, issued by his business manager on Monday, came after Pablo Torre reported Sunday that Gates had hosted and participated in a rigged poker game in Miami organized by Curtis Meeks, who is among more than 30 people indicted last week in a sweeping FBI gambling investigation. \"Antonio Gates has not been involved nor has he been accused of any wrong doing, assertions to the contrary are false and without merit,\" the statement from EAG Sports Management CEO Denise White read. \"There will be no further comments on this matter.\"The probe also led to the arrests of NBA figures, including Portland Trailblazers coach Chauncey Billups, Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and former player Damon Jones. The investigation revealed that Rozier allegedly shared insider information about player availability to inform bets on prop lines, while Billups and Jones were linked to sophisticated illegal poker operations. These games allegedly used advanced cheating techniques, including rigged shuffling machines, marked cards and even X-ray contact lenses, to defraud participants, with ties to mafia-controlled operations.\nAuthorities described the poker operation as highly organized and deliberately deceptive, targeting unsuspecting players with games that appeared legitimate but were engineered to ensure certain outcomes. Participants like Billups and Jones were alleged to have facilitated these schemes, hosting games and using insider knowledge or technological aids to gain an unfair advantage. The FBI's indictment emphasizes that the network of games was connected to La Cosa Nostra, the Italian mafia.Gates' name has surfaced only in reports without any supporting evidence of wrongdoing. He was not mentioned in the federal indictments.Gates played 16 seasons with the San Diego and Los Angeles Chargers, spending his entire NFL career with the franchise. He made eight Pro Bowls, was a six-time All-Pro and ranks as the Chargers' career leader in receptions (955), yards receiving (11,841) and receiving touchdowns (116), which also leads all tight ends in NFL history. \nGates was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2025, the first player to receive the honor without having played college football.\n            ",

    "description": "\n        Game 3 of the 2025 World Series will forever be remembered for Shohei Ohtani reaching base nine (!) times and Freddie Freeman ending the 18-i",
    "body": "\n        Game 3 of the 2025 World Series will forever be remembered for Shohei Ohtani reaching base nine (!) times and Freddie Freeman ending the 18-inning marathon with a walk-off home run, but it wasn't just the stars who carried the Dodgers to a win and 2-1 series lead. Will Klein, the last reliever in the bullpen, threw four scoreless innings and picked up a well-earned. \"Just keep going,\" Klein said after the game about his performance. \"We weren't losing that game, and so I had to keep  going back out there.  I was going to keep doing that and doing all I  could to put up a zero and sit back down and go do it again.\" Klein had not thrown four innings in a game since he was in college and his 72 pitches far exceeded his previous season high (45 in Triple-A on Aug. 30) and his previous high as a professional (56 in Single-A on July 1, 2021). He held the Blue Jays to one single, two walks, and a hit batter in his four innings. The two walks came in Klein's fourth inning of work, when he was clearly out of gas. \"Will went four innings tonight, filled up the strike zone, competed his  tail off,\" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said after the game. \"And in the postseason people talk about the superstars, but a  lot of times it's these unsung heroes that you just can't expect, and  guys come to pass and pop.  Tonight was will Klein's night.\" \nKlein is, literally, the last guy in the bullpen for the Dodgers this series. He was not on their Wild Card Series, NLDS, or NLCS rosters, and was only added to the World Series roster because the Blue Jays have a lineup that leans right-handed, which meant Klein made sense as a matchup option. Clearly though, he was not expected to pitch important innings, let alone four important innings. So, who is Klein, the bullpen savior who set up Freeman for the walk-off home run and helped the Dodgers move to within two wins of their second straight World Series title? Here's what you need to know about the 25-year-old right-hander.  Four teams in 16 months A fifth-round pick out of Eastern Illinois by the Royals in 2020, Klein has become well-traveled these last 16 months. Kansas City traded him to the Athletics in the Lucas Erceg deal at last summer's trade deadline. The A's designated him for assignment to clear a 40-man roster spot when they signed José Leclerc in January, then traded him to the Mariners for cash. \nKlein never did get into a game with the Mariners, instead throwing 21 ⅓ innings with a 7.17 ERA for their Triple-A affiliate. They designated him for assignment in June to open a 40-man roster spot for top prospect Cole Young, who was called up to play second base. The Mariners traded Klein to the Dodgers for journeyman lefty Joe Jacques soon thereafter. After spending most of his time with the Dodgers in Triple-A, Klein had a strong September cameo, throwing 15 ⅓ innings with a 2.35 ERA. He did walk too many batters though (10), which has long been an issue for him. Klein walked 36 batters in 44 Triple-A innings between the Mariners and Dodgers this year. Those walks are why he's on his fourth team in a little more than a year.  'Hitters do not get comfortable at-bats' Klein was (and still is, really) a legitimate prospect, though not an especially well-regarded prospect because he is a reliever with walk issues, and those guys aren't exactly uncommon. Baseball America ranked him as the 18th-best prospect in the Royals' system before the trade last year. Here's a snippet of their scouting report: \nHitters do not get comfortable at-bats against Klein. He attacks with a  double-plus fastball that sits 95-97 mph and touches 100 while playing  up in the zone with vertical movement. His above-average 12-to-6  curveball is a hard downer at 82-84 mph that complements his fastball  thanks to its hard drop, but he needs to land it more often for strikes  down in the zone. Klein resumed throwing a high-80s slider/cutter that  is now a plus pitch and a second swing-and-miss offering ... He lacks athleticism, and the  stiffness of the body affects his ability to repeat his delivery, thus  negatively impacting his control ... He can work himself  into high-leverage situations if he continues to reduce his walk rate. \tKlein hit 99.3 mph with his fastball in Game 3 and his final fastball -- his 71st pitch of the night -- clocked in at 96.8 mph. He was clearly running on fumes in that fourth inning, but even on fumes, Klein showed a plus fastball. Stuff is not an issue and never has been. If Klein throws strikes, something he did well in Game 3, he can dominate. We saw his upside in Game 3.  When will he be available again? It's the World Series and everyone is available every night, though I have to assume Klein is an emergency-only option in Game 4 on Tuesday. He might be able to give the Dodgers an out or two (or three) in Game 5 on Wednesday. I'm sure the Dodgers would like to avoid Klein in Games 4 and 5, give him the off-day Thursday as well, then have him fully available on three day's rest in Game 6 on Friday if necessary. Given his workload and the series state, it's possible Klein has thrown his final pitch of 2025. \"Each time I went out and I felt my legs were tired I'm like,  well, who cares?,\" Klein said after the game. \"No one else is going to care that my legs are  tired right now.  The hitter doesn't care, so why should I? And just  finding it in me to throw one more pitch, and then throw another one  after that.  And then sitting down and getting back up, the same thought  going back out there for the next one.  Like, putting up a 0, we're not  losing this game.  That's kind of what got me through it.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        If you are a hockey fan and or want to get into NHL betting, tonight is Christmas and your birthday all rolled into one as the NHL stages its third-ever Frozen Frenzy -- which means all 32 teams in action. It's actually the sixth 16-game day in league history, but what's different about the Frenzy is that the puck drops are all staggered. The first two games feature Calgary at Toronto and Pittsburgh at Philadelphia, and those start at 6 ET with the Battle of Pennsylvania in the first game of an ESPN tripleheader. All games will be available there or pm ESPN+, and ESPN2 will feature a whiparound all night -- sort of like an NHL version of the NFL's Red Zone. Bet the NHL's Frozen Frenzy at DraftKings, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if their first wager wins + three months of NBA League Pass:Vegas-Carolina, a possible Stanley Cup Finals preview, starts at 6:30 ET. Then we have 15-minute staggered start times though the 9 ET puck drop of New Jersey at Colorado, another possible Finals preview. After that, 30-minute staggered start times capped by an 11 ET matchup of Los Angeles at San Jose. All of the top sportsbooks have Frenzy specials. At FanDuel, Colorado at Buffalo is priced +1000 to be the highest-scoring game, but the Maple Leafs are +1600 leaders to score the most goals.I've been the top NHL expert on SportsLine for years, so there's no way I'm not playing at least a half-unit on all 16 of these games for fun -- although I expect to profit. The last 16-game day was Oct. 11 this year and included the second-most goals on a single day in NHL history at 110. The overall mark for most goals in a day is 114 on Nov. 4, 2023, when there were 15 games.What's the record for most hat tricks in a given day? Seven, way back in on Jan. 18, 1984, when there were only seven games, but the NHL was a high-scoring league then. There have been five hat tricks on 16-game days, including on Oct. 11 by the Blue Jackets' Kirill Marchenko. That any player has one today is a Yes-only -230. Edmonton superstar Connor McDavid is a +850 favorite at DraftKings to lead all players in points tonight even though he's having a down season. Note that I almost always play home teams in the NHL, in part because I believe the last line change is such a big factor among. The record for most home wins on a single day is 13 on Nov. 23, 2018, when there were 15 games. The 16-game day record is 11 home wins on April 8, 2023. Games listed in chronological order.Flyers -152 vs. PenguinsIt's the second of a back-to-back for the Pens after I backed them at home Monday vs. St. Louis and they rolled 6-3. Playing a second game in 24 hours is really all the reason I need, but Pittsburgh will again be without top-six forward Rickard Rakell (eight points) after he sat Monday and will miss 6-8 weeks. Pittsburgh is also using backup Arturs Silovs in net. Philly is healthy, on normal rest and Dan Vladar (1.81 GAA) has been great. Maple Leafs -1 (-128) vs. FlamesToronto has swept this season series three straight years, and Calgary has just a single road win this season. That came opening night, and it hadn't won anywhere since until Sunday at home vs. the Rangers. We may see history here with Leafs star John Tavares one goal shy of becoming the 49th NHL player to reach 500 regular-season goals. Another Toronto star forward, William Nylander, missed Saturday's win injured but is likely back. Hurricanes -135 vs. Golden KnightsNot sure we'll ever fade Carolina on home ice this season even as good as Vegas might be, although it is 0-2 on this three-game trip (one total goal scored) and playing a third game in four nights. No. 1 goalie Adin Hill remains out. The Canes are 2-0 at home but haven't play there since way back on Oct. 11. Sabres -115 vs. Blue JacketsBuffalo is starting to get healthy with No. 1 netminder Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen making his season debut Saturday, albeit in a tough-luck overtime loss in the second game of a back-to-back for the Sabres. They have won four straight at home and against a lot better foes than Columbus -- which is one of two teams tonight on the front end of a back-to-back, along with Toronto. Panthers -1 (-123) vs. DucksIf your book doesn't offer -1 lines (and a chunk of them don't), the regulation line is fine here. Florida will be without Brad Marchand among a few other key players who opened the season on IR. And Anaheim isn't that bad this season, but I don't really see it winning at the champs at the end of a five-game trip through the East. The Ducks are without a few regulars due to injury or illness. This may push, but we accept those at -1. Islanders -130 at BruinsSecond game of a back-to-back for Boston, which lost 7-2 in Ottawa on Monday. The Bruins used their better goalie in Jeremy Swayman for that one. That means barring something crazy, it should be Joonas Korpisalo tonight and he's 1-3-0 with a 4.03 GAA, giving up at least three in each outing. So that's why we're backing the road team outright. New York's Ilya Sorokin is undefeated in regulation over his last three outings.Predators +1.5 (-175) vs. LightningA Steven Stamkos homecoming game of sorts, as the future Hall of Famer and Tampa Bay legend left for Nashville in free agency ahead of last season. Maybe he shouldn't have departed, as his numbers went way down then and are significantly worse so far this year. But I like home teams getting +1.5 at a relatively reasonable number. And if recent history is any indication, we may see Bolts backup goalie Jonas Johansson (3.04 GAA).  Wild -110 vs. JetsMinnesota has been a major disappointment and has lost three straight, allowing at least six goals in each game. Not really sure why the Wild have been so bad (well, goaltending mainly) considering they are tied for the NHL lead with 13 power-play goals. It's one of those tricky one-game road trips for Winnipeg in an otherwise home-heavy schedule. NHL (and NBA) players hate those types of games. Red Wings +1 (-161) at BluesIt's the second game of a back-to-back for the Blues. On Monday I bet on Pittsburgh, which for some reason was getting +1 at home despite the fact St. Louis was without forwards Jake Neighbours (team-leading seven points) and Robert Thomas (six points). The Blues were routed. Not clear if they will play tonight, but Detroit is the better team either way and is rested. The Red Wings just beat the Blues 6-4 in Motown on Saturday. Stars -140 vs. CapitalsThis is the second ESPN puck drop at 8:30 ET. It's a good matchup and probably the marque event of the night simply as Alex Ovechkin is one goal shy of becoming the first player in NHL history with 900 in the regular season -- and is +160 to get one (I say no). He played in regular-season game No. 1,500 on Saturday but couldn't score for a second game in a row, managing a single shot in a loss to Ottawa. Stars goalie Jake Oettinger, who might be the No. 1 at the Olympics for Team USA, seems to be rounding back in to form after a few bad starts and has much better home splits. Blackhawks +1 (-139) vs. SenatorsSecond of a back-to-back for Ottawa. As a Hawks fan, I would have preferred that the Sens had used No. 1 goaltender Linus Ullmark on Monday in routing vs. Boston, but alas they opted for No. 2 Leevi Merilainen. So this has a bit of a less chance of cashing, but mediocre Chicago netminder Arvid Soderblom started the last game so it will surely be very good No. 1 Spencer Knight here. The Blackhawks are 8-1 ATS. Avalanche -150 vs. DevilsI believe this will be the highest-scoring game of the night after they combined for seven goals on Sunday with New Jersey winning 4-3 in OT at home on Jack Hughes' eight goal of the year, which tied him for the NHL lead. The Devils lost their opener and have since won eight in a row, the league's longest run so far this season. But there are fewer tougher places to play in hockey than that thin air of Denver against the always high-flying Avs, who haven't lost in regulation yet on home ice. And now they have a chance for immediate payback and to snap a four-game skid (three on the road). Oilers -150 vs. MammothUtah is leaps and bounds better with the most points in the West and 7-0-0 since unveiling its new mascot Tusky on Oct. 15. But there are few home teams I like to bet more than Edmonton, and it's fairly rare to get the Oilers at such a good price. Although what's going on with Connor McDavid? The superstar has just one goal thus far, and that's a big reason why the two-time defending West champs are a .500 team. Canucks +1 (-175) vs. RangersNew York has been a huge disappointment in the East under first-year coach Mike Sullivan, formerly of the Penguins. The Blueshirts sit last in the Metropolitan Division and haven't won a home game yet, although somehow are 3-1-0 away. Because former Vezina winner Igor Shesterkin has started the past three in net, it's likely Jonathan Quick tonight and he's a downgrade. We will want to make sure Canucks superstar blueliner Quinn Hughes plays, though, after missing Sunday with a lower-body injury. Kraken +1 (-189) vs. CanadiensI'm very high on Montreal overall this season, but the Habs just got some bad news as top-six forward Patrik Laine recently underwent surgery and will miss 3-4 months. While he had done very little this season, he led the team and was among league leaders with 15 power-play goals in 2024-25. I'd also consider Under 6.5, as Seattle netminder Joey Daccord is usually excellent at home (3-0, 1.30 GAA), but I'm only being offered 6.Sharks +1.5 (-140) vs. KingsLast of the NHL tripleheader with the 11 ET start on ESPN. San Jose still isn't very good overall but is on its way back with some intriguing young offensive talent led by Macklin Celebrini, the top pick in the 2024 draft who leads the club by far with 15 points. It's a young team with not great goaltending -- hence just the two wins for San Jose. I'm fairly certain the Sharks won't go winless at home (currently 0-2-2). It's the end of a long trip for the Kings. We are getting a home team significantly cheaper at +1.5 in a rivalry game than the road team's money line price, and that's something I always like to do. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Heading into college football's final month of the regular season, the race to the SEC Championship Game has never been more exciting. With No. 3 Texas A&M and No. 4 Alabama out front, only one game separates six teams in the league standings, most of which play each other down the stretch with College Football Playoff implications.If the SEC produces four teams in the 12-team playoff bracket, that would match the Big Ten's record number of entries last fall. That would equate to three of the playoff's seven at-large entries given to the SE≥C, leaving hopes of leagues outside of the Big Ten expecting multiple bids waning.NO. 5 Georgia, No. 7 Ole Miss, No. 9 Vanderbilt and No. 20 Texas will have a say over the next few weeks leading up to rivalry weekend, which could decide the pair who fight for a conference title.It should be noted that two-loss No. 14 Tennessee and No. 18 Oklahoma are still part of the Atlanta discussion, but substantial help is needed. Saturday's game at Neyland Stadium eliminates one of those teams from contention with a Sooners victory commencing a chain reaction-like sequence of results that need to happen for Oklahoma to play in the SEC title game. \n\n        \n            \n                Bowl projections: Vanderbilt enters CFP bracket as SEC's fifth team, BYU flexes as new Big 12 frontrunner\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIn short, if Oklahoma and Texas A&M win out, the Sooners would need an LSU win over Alabama, a South Carolina upset of Ole Miss and Texas beating Georgia to finish in a four-way tie with Alabama, Georgia and Ole Miss. Then, by virtue of leading conference opponent win percentage (0.531) and a head-to-head win over Alabama by winning out, Oklahoma earns the tiebreaker.The path is similar for Tennessee, with a few more things that need to happen for the Vols, which starts with winning out since they've suffered head to head losses to Alabama and Georgia -- two teams ahead of them in the current standings.Here's a comprehensive look at each team's path to the 2025 SEC Championship Game  entering the final month of the regular season:\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Texas A&M (8-0, 5-0)Clearest path: Wins over Beau Pribula-less Missouri, South Carolina and Texas get the Aggies to Atlanta and likely a first-round bye in the playoff. Texas A&M's humming through nine weeks and is coming off its biggest SEC win in Baton Rouge after humiliating LSU. The Aggies' toughest conference win up to this point was a 16-10 victory against Auburn at home on Sept. 27.Chaos scenario: Coming out of this week's open date, Texas A&M's trip to Missouri could get tricky if the Tigers are able to half Marcel Reed's progress in the Heisman picture and stun the Aggies. Keep an eye on the regular-season finale on Black Friday at Texas. That potentially sets up for a winner-take-all outcome like last season's tilt if the Longhorns beat Vanderbilt, Georgia and Arkansas over their next three games.Tiebreaker talk: Texas A&M had the luxury this season of not having to play Alabama, Georgia or Ole Miss in conference play, but the likelihood is high one of those fellow elites will be awaiting the Aggies in December. None of the five SEC teams Texas A&M has beaten up to this point has a winning record in conference play this season.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Alabama (7-1, 5-0)Clearest path: Win out against LSU, Oklahoma and Auburn. One of only two teams in the SEC with an unblemished league record up to this point, the Crimson Tide control their own destiny like the Aggies. Saturday's comeback win at South Carolina was pivotal coming off four consecutive league wins over ranked teams. Losing to the Gamecocks would've tossed a wrench into everything SEC title-related.Chaos scenario: Surely, the Crimson Tide won't lose to LSU under an interim coach in two weeks, right? If it happens, that kicks into play various threats currently behind Alabama in the SEC standings, namely Vanderbilt, Tennessee and Georgia. The home bout with Oklahoma next month could be a top-15 showdown if the Sooners win in Knoxville this weekend.Tiebreaker talk: Alabama's in great position to reach its end game of appearing in the SEC Championship Game for the first time under Kalen DeBoer. That three-point win at Georgia in September looms large at this point, along with those victories over Vanderbilt and Tennessee.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Georgia (6-1, 4-1)Clearest path: The Bulldogs need help in their quest to win their second straight SEC crown under Kirby Smart. Control what you can control is a staple of this program during his tenure, and that'll be the message this weekend when Georgia entertains Florida at EverBank Stadium in Jacksonville. The Bulldogs must win that game, then beat Mississippi State and Texas to stay alive.Chaos scenario: With nationally ranked wins this season over Tennessee and Ole Miss, this team's resume speaks for itself. There's a couple paths for Georgia to Atlanta, but the most straightforward is winning out and Alabama losing two of its final three SEC games against LSU, Oklahoma and Auburn. Tiebreaker talk: If Georgia finishes in a tie for second place with Ole Miss, the Bulldogs will be playing during championship weekend ahead of final playoff selections since they beat the Rebels in Athens on Oct. 18. And if Texas A&M and Alabama each drop one of their final three games resulting in a four-way tie for first, Georgia's in based on conference opponent win percentage (0.484) and would have a rematch with the Crimson Tide.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Ole Miss (7-1, 4-1)Clearest path: It's cut and dry for the Rebels. They need to handle South Carolina, Florida and Mississippi State, then hope Georgia and Alabama finish 6-2 in conference play. That would take one loss from the Bulldogs the rest of the way and two from the Crimson Tide.Chaos scenario: Taking a league title appearance out of the equation for a second, Ole Miss is trying to avoid what happened last season at this junction -- a catastrophic November that takes one of the SEC's best teams outside of the playoff discussion. Of the current SEC teams slotted inside the top 10 ahead of next week's first selection committee rankings, Ole Miss has the easiest schedule remaining.Tiebreaker talk: Like Texas A&M, Lane Kiffin and the Rebels have taken full advantage of a favorable SEC slate by league standards this season. Unfortunately, not playing Alabama or Texas A&M means Ole Miss needs one of those two to lose twice the rest of the way to play in Atlanta. The only tiebreaker Ole Miss holds over a possible threat, at this point, is Oklahoma.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Vanderbilt (7-1, 3-1)Clearest path: Win out and hope for the best under various tiebreaker options? That's essentially where Clark Lea's team is right now since they don't own the head-to-head advantage with Alabama and have not played Texas A&M this season. The Commodores have to beat Texas this weekend, then run the table against Auburn, Kentucky and Tennessee to have a shot.Chaos scenario: If Vanderbilt finishes in a four-team tie for first with Alabama, Texas A&M and Ole Miss all at 7-1 in league play, the Commodores would be making their first appearance in the SEC Championship Game by virtue of several conference opponent win percentage metrics. All that would take is the Aggies losing one of their final three SEC matchups to Missouri, South Carolina or Texas.Tiebreaker talk: If Vanderbilt finishes in a tie for second with Ole Mis at 7-1 in conference play, the Commodores would earn the bid over the Rebels based on conference opponent win percentage (0.406). For that to happen, however, they need Alabama to lose twice next month.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Texas (6-2, 3-1)Clearest path: Like Vanderbilt, the Longhorns do not control their own destiny in getting to the SEC Championship Game. However, winning out virtually guarantees a playoff appearance for the third straight season under Steve Sarkisian. Even beating Texas A&M in the finale doesn't put the Longhorns in Atlanta since they don't own the tiebreaker with Ole Miss, who would also finish 7-1 in conference play.Chaos scenario: No team -- outside of Oklahoma and Tennessee -- needs more chaos to unfold next month than Texas if the Longhorns want to battle for a conference title. In the event of a three-way tie for first at the end of the season with Alabama and Ole Miss at 7-1 overall, Texas would get the No. 1 seed over both based on record vs. common conference opponents all played one time (Longhorns would've have beaten Georgia, who took out Ole Miss and has a win over Oklahoma, who would need to upset the Crimson Tide on Nov. 15. ... out of breath, yet?)Tiebreaker talk: If Texas beats Vanderbilt and Georgia, and Texas A&M is upset before these two meet in Austin in late November, then the Longhorns would be playing for a berth in Atlanta. That would put Texas and Ole Miss in a two-way tie for second place behind Alabama, and the Longhorns get the nod since they would have a win over Georgia -- and the Rebels would not.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        LOS ANGELES -- Even rare air doesn't cover it. It doesn't do him justice. It can't define what the universe has watched from Shohei Ohtani on the grandest stage in one of the grandest markets. His presence is imposing. Willful. Games tilt on his power alone. Gravity is a force no man can overcome. But Ohtani makes it feel optional.It's impossible to forget. Not when the stature keeps rising. Not when the stakes go up and the player does, too. All his at-bats in a thrilling and ridiculous World Series Game 3 against the Blue Jays were a reminder of what his stage demands. Freddie Freeman launched the walk-off homer in the 18th inning. But it was Ohtani's show in Monday's 6-5 win at Dodger Stadium, a 399-minute affair that was the second longest World Series game of all time.\"He's the best player on the planet,\" said Dodgers manager Dave Roberts.Blue Jays manager John Schneider flashed four fingers from the first-base dugout, after watching Ohtani do it again. And again. He was 4 for 4 to that point. Two homers and two doubles. He was the first player ever in postseason history with multiple home runs, multiple doubles, and multiple walks in a single game. \n\"Every game's different,\" Schneider said. \"Every pitcher's different. The guy's a great player. There's certain times where you feel like you feel better about someone else beating you. If that someone else is Mookie Betts or Freddie Freeman it still stings. But he had a great game and we're just going to try to continue to execute.\"The swings got longer from everyone else. The feet got heavier. Relievers turned to starters and starters turned to afterthoughts. Each side yearned for a mistake from the opposition and equally a run for their club in a game that started a little after 5 p.m. local time and nearly lasted until midnight.Ohtani was the reason his club was in it in the first place, reaching base nine times, the most ever in a playoff game. In his 17th-inning at-bat, his final of the night, Schneider took a visit to the mound to chat with Brendon Little. \"We were trying to pitch around him,\" Schneider said. \nThey pitched to him this time ... and walked him on four pitches. Ohtani led off the bottom of the first with a double off Max Scherzer. Remember him? Scherzer made it just 4⅓ innings. In the third, Ohtani got him again, turning on an up-and-in fastball off the plate and yanking it to right for a solo shot.Then in the seventh, he showed the full field, going oppo with a game-tying home run off Seranthony Domínguez.\nEvery time the Blue Jays answered -- as they always do -- Ohtani made sure his response was louder. That's when Schneider had enough.\n\"He was on the heels of a huge offensive night, and John smelled that and wasn't going to let Shohei beat him at all,\" Roberts said. \"Obviously, and even when nobody's on base and putting him on to make the other guys beat him. Respect it and, fortunately, we have other guys behind Shohei that can still do some things and, yeah, I mean, a hard-fought game.\" A hard-fought game made possible by the heroics of Ohtani. He proves time and again that he's not of this ilk. Not of this game that can make others crumble. He rewrites its limits. His limits. His next task? Ohtani will be the Dodgers' starting pitcher in Game 4. He'll throw the first pitch 17 hours and 20 minutes after Game 3 ended. He has the chance to pitch his team to a 3-1 series lead, preserve a bullpen that badly needs a break and put the Dodgers on the brink of being baseball's first repeat champ in a quarter century.\n\"He's a unicorn,\" said Freeman. \"There's no more adjectives you can use to describe Shohei. It's 4 for 4, five walks, he finally got pitched to in his last at-bat, and he still had the patience to not try to do too much and got on base. He's just incredible. We've been talking about him since he got [to MLB] in 2018. We're still running out of words to describe a once-in-a-ten-generational player.\" Unicorns don't exist. Ohtani does.Yet despite Ohtani stretching the impossible, Game 4 will bring its tests. While running the bases in extra innings, Ohtani came up cramping but stayed in the game. That will be something to watch. How long do his legs hold up? How long can he go? The Dodgers need him to go deep after using everyone in their bullpen. Roberts even considered going to a position player at the end until Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who just pitched a complete game two days prior, volunteered to go into the game. The Blue Jays will likely be without George Springer, who left the game with right side discomfort and underwent an MRI. But their DNA still exists. They don't strike out much. They'll challenge Ohtani to make pitches. They'll work his pitch count, knowing the Dodgers are thin behind him. But this is what Ohtani wants. When people question how much he can handle, he shifts into another gear. When they doubt he can pitch and hit at this level, he elevates above the noise and dominates. He can carry a team. A country. The demands and pressures of a sport where the gaze of the world is fixed on his figure. On his possibility.\nHis teammates don't see possibility. They're beyond that. Everything now is just affirmation of what they already know. \"He's a freak,\" said Will Klein, who pitched four scoreless frames in relief. \"I don't know how anyone can do what he does. Being the best hitter and the best pitcher in the league. I don't think there's a word to describe it other than he's the GOAT. He's going to shove Tuesday.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        I like to say the NFL always delivers, but this week put that to the ultimate test. Only one game was decided by a single possession, the fewest in a single week since Week 14, 1970. There were nine wins by at least 18 points, tied most ever in a single week according to CBS Sports research.But, oh, that one-possession game. Jets 39, Bengals 38. Just five days after his team's owner fired shots at him, Justin Fields led three fourth-quarter scoring drives to secure a tremendous comeback. Aaron Glenn got his first career win as coach. Breece Hall, held out of the end zone all season and subject of trade rumors, scored twice on the ground and threw the game-winning touchdown to Mason Taylor. Yes, threw!After the game, Fields detailed how emotional of a week it was for him, how he was crying on the floor of his closet. You can say a lot of negatives about the Jets, but you can't say they don't care.\nGood for Justin Fields. Good for Aaron Glenn. Good for the Jets. Here's what else was good this week.\nFive things we liked in Week 81. Jordan Love puts on a show, shows he's growing upMuch of the discourse surrounding the Steelers vs. Packers \"Sunday Night Football\" matchup revolved around Aaron Rodgers facing Green Bay, where he spent the first 18 years of his career, for the first time.Then the guy who had to wait behind him before ultimately succeeding him stole the show. Jordan Love played one of his finest games as a pro: 29 for 37 for 360 passing yards, three touchdowns, no interceptions and no sacks. His 0.52 expected points added per dropback was the highest mark of any start in his career. Not only were his numbers excellent across the board, but his play reflected that of a maturing quarterback, one who is combining his immense arm talent with his ability to keep things on schedule.At one point, Love completed 20 straight passes in a row, making the Pittsburgh defense look hopeless. You can watch (or relive) all 20 here, but let's highlight two. First, this absolute beauty to Christian Watson:\nThis is a trick shot throw, the ones only a handful of quarterbacks can make. Off-platform, on the move, deep downfield ... highlight-reel stuff through and through. Love has always made these throws (or at least tried to make these throws). And how about this one to Romeo Doubs?\nBut what we really like is that Love is willing to eat his vegetables -- make the throws that aren't so exciting but are the ones that keep the offense moving. On throws 10 yards or fewer downfield, Love went 23-for-29, the 23 completions his third-most in a game in his career. His most came in Week 4 against the Cowboys: 28-for-31. Those are surgical numbers.This shows Love's biggest area of growth this year. He can make those trick shot throws, but he doesn't have to.\nJordan LoveThis seasonPrevious career bestComp pct70.9%64.2%Turnover-worthy throw rate1.4%3.3%Explosive play rate11%10.6%Off-target rate7.5%10.6%Expected points added per play0.260.12He's more accurate and more careful with the ball while still producing big plays. That is an incredible formula. With his big Sunday night, Love is second in EPA per play this season, only behind Daniel Jones. Love is a legitimate MVP candidate, and Week 8 showed his maturation on a big stage.It also helps that ...2. Tucker Kraft is everything you could want in a tight endTucker Kraft is a hero to tight ends everywhere, not only because he's really good, but because he saved National Tight Ends Day with a seven-catch, 143-yard, two-touchdown game against the Steelers.\nAnd, of course, this ...\n Kraft had 128 of his 143 yards after the catch, and he produced some quotes to go along with it speaking to SportsCenter:\"Every time I touch the ball I want to force the entire defense to run after me.\"\"I wanna create extreme disruption on the other side of the football.\"\"The first thing I do is I just try to get ugly with my off-hand weapon, and get north-south as violent as I possibly can.\"A tight end through and through. But don't just take my word for it. Look at where Kraft has caught his passes this year:\n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            He can win deep. He can win intermediate. He can win short. No one wants to tackle him. He's a willing blocker. What a fun, good player.3. C.J. Stroud doesn't give in to bad habitsDown their best offensive weapon and coming off a short week and a miserable offensive performance, the Texans' offense could have gone in the wrong direction again against the 49ers. Instead, C.J. Stroud played one of his best games in recent memory to get Houston right back into the win column.One of Stroud's biggest flaws is his tendency to retreat backwards out of muddy pockets, making bad plays worse. Last year, only Aidan O'Connell, Anthony Richardson and Bo Nix averaged more yards lost per sack. This year, he is dead last in the category at 9.3 yards lost per sack.But Sunday, he didn't take a sack and, notably, escaped effectively a few times.\nSecond, we liked how Stroud and the Texans' offense operated cleanly and mostly on time, something that's been a major struggle behind the offensive line. Stroud faced pressure on just 23.8% of his dropbacks, the sixth-lowest rate in his career, and wasn't sacked for just the second time in the past two seasons.Stroud took what was available, going an incredible 25 for 26 on throws 10 yards or fewer downfield. The 96.2% completion percentage is the highest on those throws by any player (min. 25 attempts) in a game since Tom Brady in 2021. When Stroud did let it fly, he reminded us of his talent in that department, too.\nThe Texans clearly identified an area (short throws) they wanted to pick on against a banged-up 49ers defense. The result was their best win of the year.4. Let's give Broncos' and Colts' offensive lines some loveThe Broncos ran for a season-high 179 yards against the Cowboys, and the Colts ran for 164 yards, second-most this season, against the Titans. Neither Dallas nor Tennessee will be confused with the '85 Bears, but those are impressive totals. Let's take a look at two of the week's best runs. Instead of watching RJ Harvey and Jonathan Taylor, watch Quinn Meinerz (No. 77) and Tanor Bortolini (No. 60) on these plays.\nIndianapolis guard Quenton Nelson is PFF's top-graded run-blocking guard in the NFL. Meinerz is fourth. Bortolini is the No. 3-ranked center. The Broncos are PFF's top-graded pass blocking unit. The Colts are fourth in both pass blocking and run blocking. These are excellent units.5. Ravens stop the run ... finallySpeaking of running the ball, the Ravens are at long last doing a better job stopping it. Baltimore limited a Bears offense that had shown legitimate improvement running the ball to just 96 yards on the ground. Two weeks earlier, they limited the Rams to 74 rushing yards. In their first five games, they had allowed over 146 rushing yards per game.Safety Alohi Gilman, acquired from the Chargers, has been a big addition. Roquan Smith had arguably his best game of the year, and the Ravens will hope he ascends as the year goes on, just as he did last year. Lamar Jackson's impending return is helpful, but the Ravens' defense had to improve for that to matter. Over the past two games, it has done just that.Oh, and the Steelers, Bengals and Browns all lost on Sunday, meaning Baltimore, even at 2-5, is just two games out of first in the win column in the AFC North. The Ravens have one of the easiest schedules remaining. I'm just saying ...Five things we didn't like in Week 81. Does anyone know when forward progress ends?There's a litany of officiating issues facing the NFL, but the idea of \"forward progress\" reared its ugly head several times in Week 8.My colleague John Breech runs through it all succinctly.\nJust an absolute joke. Jalen Hurts is quite literally pushing his body and the ball forward. If that's not forward progress, what on Earth is?! The tush push is already impossible to defend and even harder to officiate. The Eagles can't get every single advantage. CBS Sports senior NFL insider Jonathan Jones wrote that the Tush Push might be dead because of this exact play.\n        \n            \n                The tush push didn't die in a meeting room; it died on a Sunday in Philadelphia\n                \n                    Jonathan Jones                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThere were two other significant forward progress issues I counted: J.K. Dobbins was apparently stopped at the 1-yard line, and Olamide Zaccheaus' forward progress was somehow stopped -- even though he had literally just reeled in the pass -- before he got stripped by Marlon Humphrey.\nPlayers have to be able to fight for yards. If they do, they have to be penalized for the potential miscues that come with that.\n2. The Atlanta FalconsThere was so much hope, it seemed, for the Atlanta Falcons after a 24-14 win over the Bills in Week 6. Since then, they've lost to the 49ers and the Dolphins.This week was especially damning. Kirk Cousins, in for the injured Michael Penix Jr., managed a paltry 173 passing yards. Bijan Robinson fumbled the ball without being touched.\nBut the defense was somehow the biggest letdown. One week after a dismal 31-6 loss to the Browns, the Dolphins had their second-best passing success rate and third-best rushing success rate this season. Tua Tagovailoa was sacked just once. And this was a Falcons defense that has been very good all season!\nThe Falcons have now lost 34-10 to the Dolphins and 30-0 to the Panthers. Yikes. 3. Caleb Williams' and the Bears' lack of situational awarenessDo you ever yell in vain at the TV, unable to prevent a player from doing something bad? I am not Bears fan, nor am I a \"yells at TV\" guy, but Caleb Williams almost turned me into the latter. This play, with under 57 seconds left in the first half, was the culprit.\nI will never pretend to be able to make this play or run this fast, but it seems like Williams could have gotten out of bounds here, right?Things only got worse from there. After Chicago took its second timeout, Williams completed to Zaccheaus in bounds for 5 yards. Then, under duress, he committed intentional grounding. The Bears had to use their third timeout to prevent a 10-second runoff. After a 9-yard completion to Colston Loveland, Cairo Santos -- whose career long is 55 yards and who was returning from injury -- missed a 57-yard field goal.\nLate in the game, down 30-16, Williams completed a 42-yarder to DJ Moore down to the Baltimore 3. Again, he didn't get out of bounds.\nThe Bears, with no timeouts and in a complete frenzy, then went incompletion, complete pass short of the end zone, quarterback sneak stopped short, incompletion.It almost made me yell at the TV. Almost.\n4. Cam Skattebo's injuryEvery single injury stinks and is a reminder of just how touch-and-go things in the NFL can be. But Cam Skattebo's dislocated ankle is a major, major bummer. The Giants aren't a particularly good team, but led by Skattebo and Jaxson Dart, they were something they haven't been in a long time: fun.Skattebo, who had quickly endeared himself to Giants fans and the NFL as a whole with his hard running style and rambunctious attitude, issued a statement saying it's \"just the beginning of [his] journey,\" and he's right. Unfortunately, it's a tough end what had been an excellent beginning.5. The Steelers' uniformsReally? With all eyes on Rodgers against his former team, he has to wear this?\n\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            \n            ",

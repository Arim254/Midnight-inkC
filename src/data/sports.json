    "body": "\n        Anytime touchdown wagers have become one of the most popular bets for sports gamblers these days. Everyone wants to know which stars will find the end zone, and which long-shots are in position to surprise everyone by finding pay dirt. Last week, we saw Denver Broncos wide receiver Troy Franklin catch two touchdowns, while Jahan Dotson of the Philadelphia Eagles scored in place of the injured A.J. Brown. Then, who saw the 40-year-old Joe Flacco rushing for a touchdown vs. the New York Jets? Below, we will break down five anytime TD bets to consider for Week 9. These will not be predictable choices like Derrick Henry or Jahmyr Gibbs, but they won't be wild long-shots such as a team defense. Let's begin with a running back that has been one of the biggest surprises of this season so far. Odds courtesy of FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 bet:\n1. RB Rico Dowdle, Carolina Panthers (+220)\nEveryone will be on Josh Jacobs (-150) to score a touchdown in this matchup, but let's go in a different direction. This is a solid price for Dowdle, and it has already fallen from +270 to +220. I imagine the logic behind this price is that sportsbooks believe the Green Bay Packers are going to absolutely destroy the Panthers, leaving little opportunity for Dowdle to carry the rock. But are we sure the Packers should be favored by 13.5 points with Bryce Young back?Dowdle's 605 rushing yards this season rank fifth in the NFL, and his 5.7 yards per rush rank third. He hasn't scored a touchdown in two straight weeks, but has found the end zone in three out of four home games this year. Coach Dave Canales hinted at a bigger workload for Dowdle moving forward, so this is good value.2. WR Ladd McConkey, Los Angeles Chargers (+200)McConkey has recorded 294 yards receiving and caught three touchdowns over the last four games. Realistically, I think any Chargers wide receiver to score a touchdown is a good bet this week, because the Tennessee Titans are down their top three cornerbacks from Week 1. The franchise traded Jarvis Brownlee Jr. and Roger McCreary away, while L'Jarius Sneed is on injured reserve. That leaves Jalyn Armour-Davis, Darrell Baker Jr., Marcus Harris, Samuel Womack III and Micah Robinson to cover an extremely talented wide receiving corps. \n3. RB RJ Harvey, Denver Broncos (+350)\nLast week, Broncos running back RJ Harvey became the third rookie in franchise history to rush for two touchdowns and catch a touchdown in a single game, joining Clinton Portis and Terrell Davis. That's correct, Harvey scored three total touchdowns last Sunday. Obviously the Houston Texans defense is a lot better than the Dallas Cowboys defense, but +350 is a nice price. 4. QB Josh Allen, Buffalo Bills (+105)\nThe reigning NFL MVP has recorded a rushing touchdown in three out of five regular-season games vs. the Kansas City Chiefs. Last week against the Panthers, Allen had his 46th game with a passing touchdown and rushing touchdown, surpassing Cam Newton for the most all time. Allen has five rushing touchdowns in seven games played this season. Sunday's matchup marks the 10th between Patrick Mahomes and Allen. Believe it or not, they are separated by just one point through the first nine meetings (Kansas City 243-242). Steve Spagnuolo knows Allen well, but when things break down in the pocket, that's when Allen turns to his legs. \n5. WR Amon-Ra St. Brown, Detroit Lions (-115)\nThe Lions are hosting the Minnesota Vikings, who have a defense that has been torched by opposing quarterbacks over the past few weeks. Jalen Hurts recorded a perfect passer rating vs. the Vikings in Week 7 while A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith combined for 304 receiving yards and three touchdowns, then three different Chargers players caught touchdowns vs. Minnesota last week. Amon-Ra St. Brown has more receiving touchdowns than any other wide receiver this season with seven, and he's tied with Ja'Marr Chase in having the most receiving touchdowns over the last three years with 29. Bonus: QB Jared Goff, Detroit Lions (+1400)\nRemember when Goff caught a touchdown against the Chiefs a couple weeks ago that was taken away due to a penalty? Maybe we see another trick play from the Lions in a game that I expect to be a blowout. Or, Goff could always sneak one in. $10 nets you $140. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Saturday night's Toronto Blue Jays 5-4 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 7 of the World Series is, from the standpoint of the defeated, of course painful. It's one loss when one win would've given you the belt and the title. That's sports agony. In this instance, though, it's worse than that because in order to arrive at the season-ending loss, the Blue Jays had to defy all manner of odds and surrender to all kinds of absurd circumstances. This merits chronicling even if doing so smacks of a certain inhumanity. The Jays, you see, were at one point two outs from winning the third World Series in franchise history, two outs from ending their 32-year title drought. Instead, closer Jeff Hoffman with one out in the top of the ninth threw a slider that was a bit too loopy, and Miguel Rojas did this to it: That turned a 4-3 Blue Jays lead into a 4-4 tie. Just before Rojas came to the plate, the Jays had a 91.3% chance of winning Game 7 and thus the World Series. The homer off Hoffman dipped that figure into the mid-50s. However, it would rise again in the bottom of the ninth. We know how the story ends -- in defeat for Toronto -- but the particulars when recounted make it seem like that can't possibly be the case. In that home half of the ninth, Bo Bichette smacked a one-out single, and he and his still-ailing knee were lifted for pinch-runner Isiah Kiner-Falefa. Addison Barger then worked a nine-pitch walk against Blake Snell to push the winning run into scoring position. Alejandro Kirk was then struck by a pitch for the second straight night to load the bases. At that point, the Jays had reconstructed their chances of winning it all back to 83.2%. \nAfter the bases were filled, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts subbed in Andy Pages for Tommy Edman in center, likely to get Pages' superior throwing arm in the game. When play resumed, Daulton Varsho bounced one to Rojas, who heaved it home just in time to force out IKF at the plate. The play was reviewed -- did Will Smith get his foot back on the plate in time? -- but upheld. What probably lodges that sequence even deeper in the craw of Toronto fans is that IKF may have rendered it all moot if he'd just taken a better lead off of third base. The Jays still had the bases loaded, though, and Ernie Clement drove one to left-center that would've been a home run in a couple of MLB parks and carried with it an expected batting average of .380. Unfortunately for Clement and the Jays, Pages was on the trail of that 366-foot drive: \nIt's not an exaggeration to say Clement was probably a hairsbreadth from never paying for a drink in Toronto again. Instead, the game went to extras, where the Jays would give up a go-ahead homer to Will Smith in the 11th and then strand the tying run on third base. Compounding the acute miseries of Game 7 is that in Game 6 the Blue Jays endured a similarly painful ninth inning in their Game 6 loss. That involved a ball lodged between wall and warning track that cost Toronto the tying run followed soon after by this game-ending sequence: \nIf there's a fitting ancestor to the Pages catch in Game 7, it's that. Had the Jays won Game 7, that all would of course be forgotten. Had the Jays gotten drummed in Game 7, how Game 6 ended would've been keenly felt for years to come. Instead, the cruelty of Game 7's ninth inning is why Game 6's ninth inning will forever lurk behind the potted palm. It's forgetting about the abscessed tooth because your torso caught on fire. \nSo instead of hoisting the trophy and using champagne as refreshment and weaponry, the Jays permitted the Dodgers to author the third-largest comeback in a Game 7 and to become just the ninth team ever to win Games 6 and 7 of the World Series on the road. The Jays themselves became just the seventh team ever to lose a postseason when leading in the ninth of the potential clinching game. The other 102 teams in that position won. From the Toronto standpoint, this one hurts and will continue to hurt for a long time. Baseball, you'll nod knowingly, is wonderful when it isn't busy being cruel. \n            ",

Miguel Rojas hit a game-tying home run in the ninth and Will Smith hit a go-ahead home run in the 11th. Yoshinobu Yamamoto got the final eight outs one day after throwing six innings in Game 6. That earned him World Series MVP honors.Before L.A.'s late-inning comeback, future Hall of Famer Max Scherzer walked off the field to a standing ovation, having fired 4 ⅓ innings of one-run ball. That performance will ultimately go down as a footnote. After Game 7, the 41-year-old Scherzer reiterated that he has no immediate plans to retire, and expects to continue pitching in 2026.\"I think I'll give a full answer on that later,\" Scherzer said when asked about retirement after Game 7. \"But I will say this: I just don't see how that's the last pitch I've ever thrown.\"\nThis season marked Scherzer's 18th in the majors, a legendary career that has included two World Series rings, three Cy Young awards, eight All-Star nods.Scherzer limped to the finish in the regular season, pitching to a 9.00 ERA with eight home runs allowed in 25 innings in his final six starts. He pitched well in the postseason though, authoring a 3.77 ERA in three starts. Scherzer doesn't pitch deep into games these days, but he can still be effective in the innings he does pitch.\nPitching is always in demand, so, if Scherzer does want to pitch in 2026, a team will surely offer him a contract, likely a contender. He's still a viable mid-to-back-end starter and he's also a great clubhouse presence. For now, Scherzer and the Blue Jays will regroup following the Game 7 loss, and figure out 2026 later.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        With the topic of illegal eye pokes fresh on the mind of most in mixed martial arts following last weekend's aborted heavyweight title bout between Tom Aspinall and Ciryl Gane, Saturday's co-main event at UFC Fight Night in Las Vegas couldn't have played out in a more bizarre and unprecedented manner. Heavyweight contender Waldo Cortes-Acosta went from nearly losing his bout against Ante Delija by first-round TKO inside the UFC Apex despite absorbing a poke to the eye, to having the fight restarted after referee Mark Smith consulted instant replay. Merely seconds later, after uncorking a monstrous, looping right hand that caught Delija flush and floored him, Cortes-Acosta was celebrating an unlikely knockout victory of his own. Cortes-Acosta (15-2) improved to 6-1 over his last seven fights by successfully rebounding from a decision loss to Sergei Pavlovich in August. But the 34-year-old native of the Dominican Republic only pulled off the dramatic stoppage by choosing to keep fighting despite an errant left hand from Delija that scraped his left eye in a similar manner to what Gane did to Aspinall at UFC 321, which caused the fight to be ruled a no contest late in Round 1. \"I feel the finger going inside my eye. The referee said to stop it. I decided to continue because I felt that I could continue,\" Cortes-Acosta said. \"My eyes were like 20% vision but I said I don't give a f---.\"\nThe irony of the situation is that Delija (26-7) is a teammate of Aspinall and criticized Gane this week at media day by saying, \"I had 33 fights and never poked someone in the eye. And I do believe the punishment for that should be severe.\"Delija's illegal poke was initially not seen by Smith. Cortes-Acosta covered up and absorbed a series of hard strikes from the knockout puncher that forced Smith to jump in and seemingly wave off the fight. Seconds later, everyone from cageside doctors to the cutmen and coaches from both teams entered the Octagon. But after instant replay was consulted following a long break, the fight was restarted. The dramatic knockout win from Cortes-Acosta came just moments later at 3:59 of the round after he dropped Delija with a single punch and attempted to follow up with ground strikes until Smith leaped in to stop the bout. \n\"Yeah, I'm mad. I'm Dominican. This is in my blood, from birth,\" Cortes-Acosta said. \"This is what happens. I come in like that every f---ing time and anyone that doesn't come in f---ing shape, I f--- him up like that.\"Delija, a 35-year-old from Croatia, is a former PFL tournament champion who made an explosive UFC debut in September when he knocked out Marcin Tybura just over two minutes into the fight. But it was Cortes-Acosta who now moves forward in a noticeably shallow division.\"I want to tell you something, Aspinall, you see that fight, no? I'm going for you,\" Cortes-Acosta said. \"Be ready, OK? Be ready.\n\"It's exciting for me. For my last fight, I pressured too much. That Russian guy [Pavlovich] got my f---ing victory and took my f---ing five straight [win streak]. I want to come back and beat the champ of the world and f--- him up, too.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        If the UFC featherweight division is looking for a new contender, veteran Steve Garcia just put his name in the hat. The 33-year-old Garcia extended his win streak to seven, including six by stoppage, with a ferocious first-round TKO of David Onama in a battle of top-15 ranked fighters at 145 pounds on Saturday. The fight served as the main event of a UFC Fight Night card from the UFC Apex in Las Vegas. Garcia (19-5), a native of Albuquerque, New Mexico, made quick work of his first headlining opportunity by jumping all over Onama (14-3) early in this matchup of southpaws with volume punching and combinations.  \"Again, I said this before, my dad [trainer Steve Garcia Sr.] told me to be violent in here, so that's what he got,\" Garcia said. \"My dad asked me, so I tried to deliver.\"\nGarcia briefly dropped Onama early with a clean left hand and never backed off applying pressure as his wobbled foe struggled to take shelter. A pair of uppercuts briefly dropped Onama a second time along the cage before Garcia backed him up again with kicks to the body. Shortly after, Garcia scored a third knockdown with more clean punches and jumped all over the fallen Onama, a 31-year-old from Uganda, with ground-and-pound until referee Herb Dean stopped the fight at 3:34 of Round 1. \n\"In here, this is kill or be killed. That's, at least, how I do it,\" Garcia said. \"I was telling [Onama] inside the cage, 'I'm going to get you so you better be ready.' I don't get paid by the hour, I get paid by the minute so I make sure I finish my opponents if it presents itself.\"\nGarcia's win streak comes after having lost two of his first three UFC fights. Not only does Garcia have 15 knockouts in 19 pro wins, he recorded the eighth first-round finish of his 12-year career. \"I'm a kid from Albuquerque who didn't have a lot going on in his life,\" Garcia said. \"I had a prayer when I was 15 years old and today was one of my answers. I wanted to make something of myself. I came to UFC and went on this long fight streak. I asked God to make me something and told him I would do the work. He's the most consistent thing in my life and I couldn't do this without him.\"Onama snapped a four-fight win streak as he suffered his first defeat since an all-action majority decision loss to Nate Landwehr in 2022.\nAfter the fight, Garcia looked to make a big splash by calling out an elite name and former champion from one division above.  \"I'm going to throw a little curveball in there. I want the Rocky Balboa story and I want Max Holloway for the BMF title,\" Garcia said.  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Dodgers right-hander Yoshinobu Yamamoto was named World Series Most Valuable Player on Saturday, just minutes after Los Angeles completed a comeback Game 7 victory against the Toronto Blue Jays. In the process, the Dodgers both overcame a 3-2 deficit in the best-of-seven set, and became the first team since the 1998-2000 New York Yankees to repeat as Fall Classic winners.Yamamoto's performance was integral to the Dodgers' victory. He appeared three times in the seven games, starting Games 2 and 6 and then pitching out of the bullpen in Game 7 and closing out the victory. Manager Dave Roberts had initially ruled out Yamamoto from Game 7 consideration after Yamamoto threw 96 pitches on Friday night. Yet Yamamoto, the same mad hatter who had begun to warm on short rest during the 18-inning marathon Game 3, pushed back and changed Roberts' mind.In doing so, Yamamoto cemented his place in both Dodgers and MLB history -- at least along the likes of Randy Johnson, who closed out the 2001 World Series after throwing 104 pitches the night before, and Sandy Koufax, who threw multiple complete games on short rest during his heyday. Yamamoto, like Johnson most recently before him, earned three wins in the 2025 World Series. He also became the third pitcher since 1960 to start World Series Game 6 and then appear in Game 7, joining Johnson (2001) and Bob Friend (1960).\nYamamoto's accomplishments weren't just about his availability, but also his capacity for giving the Dodgers quality innings. He threw two complete games this postseason, including one in Game 2. In the World Series as a whole, he struck out 15 batters in 17 innings pitched. For the postseason, he made six appearances and tallied a 1.45 ERA. L.A. went 5-1 in his outings -- how could they not?. Here's a complete list of pitchers to win Games 6 and 7 of a World Series:2025: Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Los Angeles Dodgers2001: Randy Johnson, Arizona Diamondbacks1946: Harry Brecheen, St. Louis Cardinals1925: Ray Kremer, Pittsburgh PiratesThere's a tendency to flatten the Dodgers' success to their financial might. That's understandable, but it misses a key consideration: while they have several well-compensated players, including Yamamoto himself, they also employ players who are willing to put the \"we\" before the \"I.\" Whether that's Mookie Betts changing positions seemingly every six months, Will Klein becoming a minor folk hero by exceeding his comfort level during a lengthy World Series outing, or Yamamoto offering to pitch on short rest several times during the World Series to give the Dodgers the best chance at success.  Baseball, like any professional sport or billion-dollar industry for that matter, is full of outsized egos. Watching a player like Yamamoto put the team first lets you forget about that. At least for a little while.\nGame 7 is a great capper for Yamamoto, 27, and his second season in America. He joined the Dodgers prior to last year on a $325 million contract -- the largest in MLB history for a pitcher -- following one of the best pitching careers in Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball league career. In 30 regular season starts, he compiled a 2.49 ERA (167 ERA+) and a 3.41 strikeout-to-walk ratio. He was named to his first career MLB All-Star Game. By winning the World Series MVP, Yamamoto added another accomplishment: he became the first Japanese-born pitcher to ever win the World Series MVP Award. He's the second Japanese-born player to win it overall, joining longtime New York Yankees outfielder Hideki Matsui. Matsui won the award back in 2009 by homering three times and driving in eight runs as part of a victory against the Philadelphia Phillies.Eighteen months ago, fans might've been unaware of what Yamamoto was all about, or if he would find as much success in America. Now, he's done his part to answer those questions -- and to place his name in the history books.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Toronto Blue Jays lost Game 7 of the World Series on Saturday night to the Los Angeles Dodgers in heartbreaking fashion. The Blue Jays were two outs away from their first championship since 1993, but the Dodgers ended up winning in extra innings to become MLB's first repeat champ in 25 years.Fresh off securing the franchise's first AL East title since 2015 and first pennant since that aforementioned 1993 season, the Blue Jays will now head into the winter with plenty of questions to address if they want to repeat as division champions -- something Toronto hasn't done in more than three decades.Here are a few particular matters the Blue Jays will weigh this winter.1. What will happen with Bichette?Bo Bichette, the Blue Jays' starting shortstop since 2019, wasn't on the roster for most of their playoff run after spraining his knee late in the regular season. Bichette returned in the World Series and was impactful against the Dodgers, even though he was not 100%. Bichette hit a three-run home run off Shohei Ohtani in Game 7 that looked as if it might serve as the title-clinching blast. Alas, the Jays surrendered the lead, and it's possible that Bichette's absence earlier in October was a preview of life to come. He's now slated to hit the open market this winter as one of the most attractive free agents available. \nBichette, 27, is a career .294/.337/.469 hitter (121 OPS+) with 111 home runs and 60 stolen bases to show for his seven big-league seasons. His contributions have been worth an estimated 20.8 Wins Above Replacement, according to Baseball Reference. Bichette isn't considered a strong defensive presence, but there's no denying his offensive aptitude -- that, plus his relative youth, will make him an appealing target for teams seeking an upgrade on the infield.\"I've said I want to be here from the beginning,\" Bichette told reporters after the Game 7 loss.The Blue Jays made a splash earlier this year when they locked up first baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr. on a $500 million extension, thereby preventing him from reaching free agency this offseason. Toronto general manager Ross Atkins confirmed he wanted to do the same with Bichette around that time, but nothing has materialized since.\n\"The interest is definitely there,\" Atkins said in April. \"…It's also our vision for [Guerrero and Bichette] to continue to play together. We will do everything in our power to see if we can line up.\"The Blue Jays will continue to have exclusive negotiating rights with Bichette for a few more days. After that, it's anyone's ballgame. If the two sides can't line up on a new agreement to keep Bichette in town, the Blue Jays could just slot in Andrés Giménez at the six, the way they have throughout this postseason. Alternatively, Toronto could look outside the organization. There aren't many compelling shortstop options available, however, suggesting that Giménez is not only the path of least resistance, but perhaps the best path period.2. What about the rotation?Bichette isn't the only notable Blue Jays veteran who could be on their way elsewhere. \nIndeed, most of Toronto's starting rotation is eligible for free agency, beginning with seasoned veterans Chris Bassitt and Max Scherzer. Deadline addition Shane Bieber could join them too, provided he does as expected and voids the $16 million player option he holds for the 2026 season. Those three combined to start 31 of Toronto's 66 second-half games.To provide further uncertainty, the Blue Jays also lost José Berríos to elbow inflammation in September and Bowden Francis to a shoulder impingement in June. The good news is that both resumed throwing throughout the month of October, though neither was deemed in position to help in a playoff round. Presumably Berríos and Francis will be good to go come this spring. If that is the case, the Blue Jays could -- without any re-signings or outside additions -- trot out a starting five consisting of Kevin Gausman, postseason breakout star Trey Yesavage, Berríos, Francis, and Eric Lauer. It stands to reason the Blue Jays will look to add at least one arm, if only for insurance purposes.\n3. Can key additions perform better in Year 2?For as well as the season played out for the Blue Jays, it's easy to forget that a few of their top additions from last winter did not live up to expectations.Outfielder Anthony Santander followed up the best full-season of his career by hitting just .175/.271/.294 (57 OPS+) with six home runs in 54 games. Closer Jeff Hoffman, meanwhile, posted a 4.37 ERA (98 ERA+) and issued more than 16 walks in his final 28 ⅔ innings -- those troubles didn't prevent him from saving 33 games and finishing 26 others, but they did stray from the marks he had compiled in the years prior. His home run issue (Hoffman allowed two homers per nine innings in the regular season) came back to bite him in Game 7 of the World Series as he allowed the game-tying blast to Miguel Rojas in the ninth inning.A return to form for either/both would go a long way in helping the Blue Jays position themselves to return to the World Series next fall.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        It's hard, you know -- repeating as the champions of a sport. This is the case for any athletic pursuit, and it's probably fair to say it's especially difficult in baseball, which has so much structural randomness and a related knack for defying expectations. The Los Angeles Dodgers, though, are beholden to none of that.  Following their heart-stopping comeback win over the Toronto Blue Jays in Game 7 of the 2025 World Series, the Dodgers are hereby a member of one of Major League Baseball's most exclusive guilds -- the repeat champions. Before the 2025 Dodgers came along, it had been a quarter century since a team won consecutive World Series titles. Over that same span, the NFL saw two teams win two Super Bowls in a row, and four teams won at least two NBA Finals in a row. This is baseball, so any team in the postseason is capable of winning it, and the expanded playoffs present more hurdles than ever for a team like the Dodgers. Speaking of which, as of Game 7 the Dodgers are the first team in MLB history to play postseason games in three different months.  With the Dodgers newly crowned as back-to-back champs, let's run down every team across the years that's won two or more World Series in a row. Our starting point is the onset of the modern era in 1903, when the National League and the still somewhat-fledgling American League began sending their respective champions to the \"World's Series.\" Here's a look at that most exclusive company the 2025 Dodgers have just joined.    \nTeam \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tConsecutive World Series won \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t2024-2025 Los Angeles DodgersTwo1998-2000 New York Yankees \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tThree \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t1992-93 Toronto Blue Jays \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tTwo \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t1977-78 New York Yankees \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tTwo \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t1975-76 Cincinnati Reds \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tTwo \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t1972-74 Oakland Athletics \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tThree \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t1961-62 New York Yankees \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tTwo \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t1949-53 New York Yankees \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tFive \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t1936-39 New York Yankees \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tFour \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t1929-30 Philadelphia Athletics \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tTwo \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t1927-28 New York Yankees \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tTwo \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t1921-22 New York Giants \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tTwo \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t1915-16 Boston Red Sox \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tTwo \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t1910-11 Philadelphia A's \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tTwo \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t1907-08 Chicago Cubs \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tTwo \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tIn all, just 15 teams have won two or more World Series in a row, and just eight franchises make up those 15 teams. The flagship Yankees account for six of the 15 title repeats, and just the Yankees and A's have managed more than one repeat team. Likewise, just the Yankees and A's have won three or more titles in a row at any point (the 2026 Dodgers will be aiming to join them). It seems unlikely any team will ever challenge the five trophies in a row hoisted by Casey Stengel's 1949-53 Yankees, which bridged the Joe DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle eras in the Bronx. More recently, the 2001 Yankees came tantalizingly close to extending their title run to four in a row, but one of the greatest World Series ever played went the Arizona Diamondbacks' way instead. It should be noted that it was much easier to pull this off such dynastic behavior prior to the onset of free agency in Major League Baseball in the mid-1970s, which actually helped parity and competitive balance. As for more contemporary times, yes, it's easier than ever to qualify for the playoffs in MLB, but thanks to all those rounds of play it's more difficult than ever to make a deep run.   \nThat the Dodgers survived four rounds of postseason play to defend their title makes the feat all the more impressive. In a real way, it's harder than ever to do what the Dodgers have just done, and history teaches us this. Three in a row? It seems nigh impossible, but the Dodgers play to a different standard these days. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series on Saturday night, defeating the Toronto Blue Jays in a decisive Game 7 to cap off a memorable Fall Classic. In the coming days, there will be plenty of time to reflect on the year that was and ample coverage that attempts to properly assign credit to the individuals who made this championship possible.  You won't find any of that on this webpage. Rather, in keeping with tradition, CBS Sports is honoring the crowning of a new World Series champion by highlighting five of the most obscure or otherwise random players who will benefit from this outcome in the form of a championship ring. For those new to the at-times wild world of professional baseball, it's a long accepted practice that anyone who suits up for a club in a given year is gifted their new favorite piece of jewelry. It doesn't matter if they ever appeared again or if they contributed anything of note. Tradition is tradition. With that in mind, let's touch on five members of the 2025 Dodgers you've long forgotten.1. UTL Buddy Kennedy\nKennedy could not lose this series. He was one of two players to appear in games with both the Dodgers (seven) and Blue Jays (two), ensuring he would walk away from this series with a ring to his name no matter what happened. (He also made four appearances with the Philadelphia Phillies, giving him a one-in-four shot at playing for the title winner.) Kennedy popped up with the Dodgers in August, going 1 for 17 with a hit and a run batted in while Max Muncy nursed an oblique strain. Those poor results hardly matter. Kennedy can describe himself as a champion for the rest of his days.\n2. RHP José Ureña\nLike Kennedy, Ureña was guaranteed to walk away a winner from this series. He joined the Blue Jays in May and logged six appearances, even starting twice along the way. Ureña then made his way to the Dodgers for a pair of outings in June. Add in appearances with the New York Mets, Minnesota Twins, and Los Angeles Angels and he did not want for opportunity. In 19 total appearances at the big-league level, Ureña compiled a 4.58 ERA (96 ERA+) and a 1.48 strikeout-to-walk ratio. 3. C Chuckie Robinson\nRobinson appeared in one game for the Dodgers after being claimed off waivers from the Angels over the summer. That appearance came in the middle of September, after starting backstop Will Smith injured himself. Robinson went 0 for 1 with a sacrifice hit and he scored a run after reaching on a fielder's choice. Not even a week later, he was waived and claimed by the Atlanta Braves.4. OF Eddie Rosario\nRosario too had a short stay with the Dodgers before making his way to the Braves. (He also signed with the Milwaukee Brewers in May, but he never reached the majors with them prior to his release.) Rosario started two games for the Dodgers in April when Shohei Ohtani was on paternity leave, going 1 for 4 with a single. The Dodgers waived Rosario once Ohtani returned to the club.\n5. LHP Andrew Heaney\nYou probably remember Heaney's stint with the Dodgers in 2022, but he returned to the organization for a third time in September. He pitched once, giving up three runs on four hits in the penultimate game of the season. Somehow, that still beats his first tour of duty as a Dodger, back in 2011 when he was acquired from the Miami Marlins and then shipped to the Los Angeles Angels in a trade that netted veteran second baseman Howie Kendrick.\n            ",

Things escalated from there. \nOf relevance here, the previous pitch might've just barely ticked the hand of Giménez, who appeared to reach his hand out like he was trying to wear it and get on base. This might lead some to conclusions that 1) Giménez got thrown at twice in a row or 2) Wrobleski was annoyed at Giménez for the first thing and threw at him on purpose for the second. Regardless, with the Dodgers trailing 3-1 and the top of the Blue Jays order behind Giménez -- George Springer is now 3 for 3 in the game -- it would be incredibly ill-advised for the Dodgers to throw at Giménez and allow a free baserunner. \nStill, after the brief entanglement, if we can even call it that, delayed the game, the umpires decided to warn both benches. It could alter the approach of pitchers looking to go inside, but for the most part, this is mostly a procedural move to protect against any obvious retaliatory pitches. The umpires don't want Game 7 of the World Series to get away from them. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Toronto Blue Jays lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 7 of the World Series on Saturday night. The nature of baseball is that the clock never stops ticking, and the Blue Jays will soon discover as much. In a matter of days, they'll lose exclusive negotiating rights with infielder Bo Bichette, one of the winter's top potential free agents.Bichette, 27, was recently ranked by CBS Sports as the third-best player in the class, behind Chicago Cubs outfielder Kyle Tucker and Boston Red Sox third baseman Alex Bregman. Here's what we wrote:Bichette's optimal position is second base, but his bat may convince a team to tolerate his substandard play at short for a few more years yet. He rebounded from a down season by clearing a .290 average (for the fourth time in five tries) and 60 extra-base hits (for the third time). Bichette's flat swing allows him to wear out elevated pitches, with his .337 average on offerings located in the upper half ranking fifth among qualifiers. As an added bonus, he's on the younger side for a free agent (he'll turn 28 in March).While Bichette may still be processing the World Series loss, the Blue Jays front office and others around the league now have all the reason to dig in and figure out if and how he can fit into their plans. What's the book on him, good and bad? And just where might he land, and for how much? Below, CBS Sports has compiled a buyer's guide, of sorts, to one of the winter's most interesting free-agent cases.1. StrengthsThere's never a surefire way to predict how much a player is impacted by this or that injury. Still, it seems more safe than not to write off Bichette's 2024 as a result of the repeated calf issues and a fractured finger he suffered. That's because of his youth (he'll turn 28 in March) and his track record.To wit, Bichette has produced at a level 20% or better than the league-average hitter in four of his five full seasons. (He also cleared that mark in both of his partial seasons, 2019 and 2020.) Since becoming a full-time fixture in 2021, Bichette ranks eighth among active middle infielders (min. 2,000 plate appearances) in OPS+, behind names like Corey Seager, Mookie Betts, and Bobby Witt Jr.\nBichette is highly skilled at putting the barrel on the ball. He was one of four qualified batters in the 90-90 club -- that is, 90 mph average exit velocity and 90% in-zone contact rate. Bichette's swing features a flat attack angle, allowing him to get on top of pitches up in the zone. He's an all-fields hitter, too, spraying at least 25% of his batted balls to left, center, and right. Bichette's game isn't based on power. He doesn't prioritize pulling and lifting the ball or anything like that, but he has averaged 24 home runs and 41 doubles per 162 games. Those numbers may slip in a less-generous offensive environent. All the same, Bichette ought to remain a quality batter who can slot in as a prototypical No. 2 hitter if his new team so desires.  2. WeaknessesBichette's biggest flaw is his shortstop defense. He's always struggled on plays that require him to charge in, and this season those woes have extended to whenever he's asked to range in either lateral direction. He also has below-average arm strength; though that tends to be overvalued publicly, it may rule out a move to the hot corner. Bichette's exposure to second base in the postseason -- the first of his big-league career -- has been in response to his knee injury, but he's probably heading that way on a permanent basis sooner than later. Of course, the state of the shortstop position could persuade some teams to tolerate his substandard glove if it means adding his bat to the lineup.\nThe other notable flaw in Bichette's game is his approach. His 6.4% walk rate this season represented his highest since 2019, when he appeared in 49 games. Bichette has always offered at more than 53% of the pitches he's seen in a season, and he's not inherently picky about whether or not they're within the zone. Indeed, this season he ranked in the 12th percentile in chase rate. He must maintain a high rate of contact, ideally quality contact, in order to remain productive with such swing-happy tendencies. It's fair to point out too that Bichette hasn't appeared in 150 or more games in a season since 2022. He's required time on the shelf for soft-tissue injuries involving both knees, a calf, and a quad. Generally, teams have more concern about that subset of injuries than if a player misses time because of a broken bone, with the latter often being easier to regard as a fluke incident. \n3. Contract predictionWhile contractual terms may feel channeled from another dimension, you can make some good guesses by taking precedent and adjusting for inflation and other factors.\nIn Bichette's case, there are no shortage of recent contracts inked by shortstops in their late 20s. Two in particular feel relevant here: the seven-year, $177 million pact Dansby Swanson signed with the Chicago Cubs in December 2022, and the seven-year, $182 million agreement Willy Adames reached last winter with the San Francisco Giants. In both cases, you're talking about a lengthy agreement that paid between $25 million and $26 million annually. Bichette's defense may cause some teams to take pause, but it's probably fair to assume that he'll find a suitor willing to fork over something like seven years, $189 million.4. Potential suitorsThe Blue Jays are the most obvious landing spot for Bichette. They're the only team he's ever suited up for and they expressed interest in signing him to an extension back in the spring. Perhaps being fresh off a World Series appearance -- and the windfall that comes with it -- will help the two sides find enough common ground to reach a new, long-term arrangement.\nShould Bichette reach free agency, it's worth wondering if old Blue Jays boss Alex Anthopoulos, now at the helm with the Braves, would be willing to overlook his defensive limitations and install him at short. Atlanta's plausible interest could hinge on if Ha-Seong Kim opts out of his contract, however. Elsewhere, the Los Angeles Angels are also managed generally by Perry Minasian, a scout with the Blue Jays when they drafted Bichette. That doesn't guarantee interest, but the Angels could use the help if they want to return to the postseason. Pairing Bichette with Zach Neto would make for a strong double-play combination. Beyond those clubs, the teams who received the least production from shortstop this season either have a strong internal candidate (Detroit Tigers), probably won't spend the money (Cleveland Guardians, Milwaukee Brewers), or may have hang-ups about the defense (New York Yankees). \n            ",

He led the program to a 7-6 record and a win over Boston College in the Pinstripe Bowl.\nComing into the weekend, Raiola had thrown for 1,909 yards and 17 touchdowns to just six interceptions.

    "body": "\n        Sherrone Moore's tenure as Michigan's coach has featured some incredible highs, most notably a pair of victories over hated rival Ohio State, but the Wolverines have also struggled to make themselves legitimate contenders in the Big Ten due to an offense that hasn't been up to par. Given Moore is an offensive coach, that's a considerable concern for Michigan fans who haven't been impressed by their output in big games. Their early road losses this season at Oklahoma and USC saw the Wolverines' offense sputter, scoring just 13 points in each contest. The 6-2 Wolverines won by 11 against arch-rival Michigan State last week and are currently in a dogfight with Purdue at home. Michigan is a 21.5-point favorite vs. Purdue. With star freshman Bryce Underwood now under center, the expectation for a more explosive passing attack hasn't materialized in their biggest games, and the temperature has steadily risen for Moore's seat in Ann Arbor. That hit a fever pitch on Saturday night when the Wolverines found themselves locked in a defensive struggle at home with a Purdue team that hasn't won a Big Ten game since 2023. Another poor offensive performance led to Wolverines fans wondering if it might be time to make a change, and the cost to do so wouldn't be anything close to what we've seen a number of other big programs shell out to get rid of a coach this season. Sherrone Moore buyout, contract detailsMoore's contract pays him $5.5 million in base salary and additional compensation annually, running through 2029 -- with a $500,000 retention bonus each season. His buyout is 75% of the base and additional compensation for the remainder of his contract. \nThat means if Moore was fired during the 2025 campaign, Michigan would pay him $16.5 million (including what he's been paid already this season), and if they fire him after this season, they would owe him $12.375 million for the final three years of his contract. Moore's contract also includes the obligation to seek alternative employment, where any amount earned there will offset Michigan's buyout payments. For Michigan, that is a relative drop in the bucket. With NCAA penalties having already been handed out for the sign-stealing scandal, if the Wolverines want to re-enter the coaching carousel, Moore's buyout is a minor impediment to doing so. The biggest possible concern with firing Moore wouldn't be money, but instead would be whether Underwood would explore options in the transfer portal due to a coaching change. The new reality of college football is that, like in the pros, you probably need to at least discuss a coaching change with your top stars to take their temperature on bringing in a new staff. \nIf Michigan is confident in their star quarterback sticking around, then Moore may need to finish with a flourish this season. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 1998-2000 New York Yankees are no longer baseball's last repeat champions. The Los Angeles Dodgers, thanks to a historic Game 7 comeback, beat the Toronto Blue Jays in Game 7 to win this year's World Series despite looking shockingly feeble for much of the series. The on-paper rotation advantage didn't materialize, the offense vanished for games at a time, and the bullpen and defense were too often unreliable. The Dodgers won despite looking like the inferior team for most of the seven games.You needn't try hard to see the Dodgers winning the NL West again next year, and finishing with one of the best records in baseball (if not the best) and making another run to the World Series. It's a talented roster with a deep farm system, a smart front office, and an ownership group that is willing to go above and beyond financially. The Dodgers are as all-in as a team can get. Here's what the Dodgers need to do this offseason to get stay on the top of the sport. \n        \n            \n                Dodgers end MLB's World Series repeat drought, join exclusive club of back-to-back winners\n                \n                    Dayn Perry                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n 1. It's time to start turning over the roster Truth be told, the Dodgers started this process months ago. Longtime backup catcher Austin Barnes, the club's longest-tenured position player, was released in May. Not even a week later, the Dodgers released super utility man Chris Taylor, a staple since 2016. Despite being popular teammates and important players in the franchise's recent history, neither Barnes nor Taylor were productive players anymore, so the Dodgers moved on. They did what they felt was best for the team, feelings be damned. The Dodgers must continue that process this offseason and some of it will happen organically with future Hall of Famer Clayton Kershaw having already announced his retirement. The Enrique Hernández era has run its course, especially since Postseason Kiké is no longer guaranteed to show up (he was largely quiet after the Wild Card Series). Now 35, Max Muncy remains a quality platoon bat, though he's a liability at third base, and is at the age when offensive decline can come quick. The front office may have to take Blake Treinen away from manager Dave Roberts to get him to stop using him. \nLos Angeles had the oldest group of position players in baseball this season and some of those guys (Mookie Betts, Freddie Freeman, Teoscar Hernández, Shohei Ohtani, Will Smith) are locked in long-term. They aren't locked into everyone, though, and there's an obvious need to infuse some youth into the roster (Alex Freeland, Dalton Rushing, soon enough Josue De Paula, etc.). The Dodgers need to get more athletic and better defensively, and also incorporate into the lineup more players who are on the upswing and entering their prime rather than trying to stave off age-related decline. Turning the page on a group of players who were important figures in a prosperous era of your team's history is a difficult step, but it is a necessary one and it is an unavoidable one. Several of those players for the Dodgers have already aged out as regulars or are in the process of aging out as regulars. Saying goodbye to them is tough, especially for fans, but it is the front office's job to put emotion aside and put the team in the best position moving forward. The Dodgers did that in May with Barnes and Taylor. That work must continue this winter.  2. They need another high-end bat The Dodgers sputtering offensively throughout the World Series may have surprised many given the names in the lineup, but anyone who watched them regularly this season knew it didn't come out of nowhere. The Dodgers had a knack for hard-to-believe ice cold streaks at the plate throughout the summer, and the fact of the matter is they had a mediocre offense over the final three months of the regular season. Here are their numbers from July 1 through the end of the regular season: \n DodgersMLB rankBatting average \t\t\t\t.241 \t\t\t\t20th \t\t\t\tOn-base percentage \t\t\t\t.315 \t\t\t\t14th \t\t\t\tSlugging percentage \t\t\t\t.419 \t\t\t\t11th \t\t\t\tRuns per game \t\t\t\t4.53 \t\t\t\t16th \t\t\t\tThat is a long stretch -- 77 team games, to be precise -- of being a middle of the pack offense, and there were times they were downright putrid. What happened in the World Series wasn't anything that hadn't happened for a week at a time in July, August, or September. The Dodgers have to add youth into the roster. They also just need more bats. This is not a juggernaut (or even comfortably above average) offense right now despite its star power. It is no surprise then that it has already been reported the Dodgers are expected to pursue Kyle Tucker, the offseason's best free agent and one of the top hitters and all-around players in the sport. He would fit wonderfully in right field (with Teoscar sliding over to left) and in the middle of the lineup. The Dodgers were connected to Cleveland Guardians outfielder Steven Kwan at the trade deadline and could circle back. Tampa Bay Rays second baseman Brandon Lowe is surely a trade candidate as a Rays player with an eight-figure salary. He would be a one-year rental and lengthen the lineup nicely. The offense was top heavy during the regular season and even moreso in October. The bottom four or five spots in the lineup were too often a black hole. There is room to add a bat in the outfield -- Michael Conforto was one of the worst-hitting regulars in baseball this year, so much so that he was left off the postseason roster all four rounds the Dodgers played -- and Tommy Edman's versatility allows the Dodgers to seek an infielder too. The offense is not really as bad as it looked at times during the World Series, though there is clearly room for improvement here.  3. The bullpen needs to be reworked The Dodgers won the World Series despite a really bad trade deadline. Conforto's poor season was not a secret and yet the only outfielder they acquired was righty platoon guy Alex Call. The bullpen was a problem all season, and their only addition was righty Brock Stewart, who made four appearances before going down with a shoulder injury (not a shock given his injury history). The Dodgers bet on their improvement coming from within (Conforto, Treinen, Tanner Scott, Kirby Yates, et al being better) and they were losing that bet up until the final innings of Game 7. The bullpen ranked 21st in ERA and 25th in win probability during the regular season, including 22nd in ERA and 30th in win probability after the trade deadline, which better reflects the players who were available to them in the postseason. There was much consternation about payroll when the Dodgers signed Scott and Yates, but both pitched poorly and never got their seasons on track. Yates was left off the postseason roster. Scott had to be removed from the postseason roster during the NLDS because of an infection, though he did not appear in a game before that. He was deemed untrustworthy and was pushed far down the depth chart. Bullpens are tricky. Scott and Yates (and Treinen for that matter) were among the best relievers in the sport in 2024, then they were borderline unusable in 2025. Relievers can be like that. The Dodgers could run it back with largely the same relievers next season and get significantly better results, and not be the first team to do it. Some shuffling is required though. Scott will be back and it's likely hard-throwing Edgardo Henriquez will get more responsibility. Maybe Game 3 hero Will Klein too. Righty Paul Gervase, who was part of the Ben Rortvedt/Hunter Feduccia trade with the Rays, has a chance to be an impact bullpen arm soon. I don't think reworking the bullpen is as important and turning over part of the aging position player core and adding a difference-making bat, but it is something that has to happen. The bullpen the Dodgers ran out there all season and into the postseason was too much of a liability. Their rotation was as healthy as it's ever going to get, really, and we saw how quickly that can be undermined by a shaky relief crew. Bullpen improvement can come internally, at least to some extent, but it's safe to assume the Dodgers will make outside additions as well. (I can't say I expect them to give out another Scott-sized contract though.) We collectively make too much of the postseason and I'm including myself in that \"we.\" I certainly do it. They are the most important games of the season, but, ultimately, they are just a handful of games. The playoffs are good team vs. good team and a good team has to lose. As difficult as it can be, you have to be careful to not read too much into what happens in October. This is why general managers get the big bucks: to see through the noise and remain grounded. In the case of the 2025 Dodgers, they won the World Series despite an offense prone to going silent and a shaky bullpen, so the postseason really just reinforced what we already knew. The Dodgers need an impact bat (maybe two) and to rework their relief crew. Continuing to move on from their aging stalwarts like they did with Barnes and Taylor is a must as well. That era of Dodgers baseball is ending and they have to move forward and begin assembling a new core around Betts, Freeman, Ohtani, and Yoshinobu Yamamoto. This group has more championships in it, though that doesn't mean standing pat is the right move.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The College Football Playoff Selection Committee got quite the appetizer Saturday leading into this week's first top 25 rankings release of the season on Tuesday. Texas beating Vanderbilt and chaos across the ACC has shifted some of the narratives coming down the stretch, which makes for an anxious group of teams ahead of Tuesday's reveal.In our updated bowl and playoff projections heading into Week 11, sloppy Miami's upset loss at SMU threatens the ACC's multi-team presence in the playoff conversation. Mario Cristobal still thinks his team has a shot, but this group has warts that weren't yet formed during their run to No. 2 this season and winning out is no guarantee. Georgia Tech falling from the ranks of the unbeatens at NC State was another stunner, which creates a logjam of sorts at the top of the conference alongside the following teams with one ACC loss: Louisville, Virginia, SMU, Duke and Pitt.Clemson's loss to Duke, the Tigers' sixth straight home setback against Power Four competition dating back to last season, means Dabo Swinney could miss the postseason entirely for the first time in his tenure. That's quite the disappointment for a team most had penciled in as the projected ACC champion in August. And it keeps Manny Diaz and the Blue Devils alive in the postseason race, too.\nOklahoma's win at Tennessee was an elimination game of sorts in the SEC between two-loss teams, but the Sooners have a brutal remaining slate if the hope to get there under Brent Venables.College Football Playoff Quarterfinals DateGame / LocationProjectionJan. 1 Rose BowlPasadena, Calif.(1) Ohio State vs. (8/9) WinnerJan. 1 Sugar BowlNew Orleans, La.(2) Texas A&M vs. (7/10) WinnerJan. 1 Orange BowlMiami, Fla.(3) Indiana vs. (6/11) WinnerDec. 31 Cotton BowlArlington, Texas(4) Alabama vs. (5/12) WinnerFirst roundDate LocationProjectionWinner facesDec. 19 or 20Vaught-Hemingway StadiumOxford, Miss.(8) Ole Miss vs. (9) Georgia Tech(1) Ohio StateDec. 19 or 20LaVell Edwards StadiumProvo, Utah(7) BYU vs. (10) Texas(2) Texas A&MDec. 19 or 20Autzen StadiumEugene, Ore.(6) Oregon vs. (11) Notre Dame (3) IndianaDec. 19 or 20Sanford StadiumAthens, Ga.(5) Georgia vs. (12) Memphis(4) AlabamaDon't see your team? Check out Brad Crawford's complete bowl projections.Projected College Football Playoff Field breakdown1. Ohio State (projected Big Ten champion): Fifty-five points. That's all the Buckeyes have allowed this season during this dominant eight-game start. At some point, Ryan Day's team will be challenged, but when? He would prefer it happens before the playoff, but it may not for the reigning champions, who look like they're on the same mission in 2025.2. Texas A&M (projected SEC champion): For the first time this season, the Aggies have moved ahead of Alabama in the SEC's seeding pecking order at this junction given their stance as an unbeaten. Texas A&M will be a heavy favorite its next three games before hosting Texas in a potential SEC Championship play-in game during rivalry weekend.3. Indiana: The Hoosiers pounded the football with Kaelon Balck and Roman Hemby, who combined for a punishing 198 yards on the ground and two touchdowns to pave the way at Maryland as Indiana galloped its way to 367 yards. Indiana has the Big Ten's most favorable schedule left and should be -- barring a collapse -- 12-0 entering conference championship weekend in December.4. Alabama: If Kalen DeBoer's squad gets to Atlanta with only one loss, we don't see a loss to Texas A&M in the SEC title game pummeling Alabama's ranking in the eyes of the selection committee. Two teams from the Big Ten and two from the SEC should be the first-round bye selections.5. Georgia: There's a game every season where a coach finds out all he needs to know about his football team. For Kirby Smart, that came against Florida after his Bulldogs fought off the upset-minded Gators in the fourth quarter. They're in great playoff standing by running the table against Mississippi State, Texas, Charlotte and Georgia Tech. Now, if Georgia loses to one of its final two SEC games and to the Yellow Jackets in Atlanta on Black Friday, that's going to create a sticky situation from a three-loss standpoint.6. Oregon: Oregon's hopes of winning the Big Ten for a second straight year are faint, but the bigger goal remains out front of the Ducks if they win out. An upcoming battle with USC and passing the eye test is vital for first-round home game praise.7. BYU: One of six remaining unbeatens entering the weekend prior to Navy's loss at North Texas, the Cougars know what they have to do to be a playoff team. Winning out locks it in, or BYU can get there by taking the Big 12 title after a host of tiebreakers in an unpredictable league at the moment. Next weekend's game against Texas Tech should produce this league's playoff squad ... we think.8. Ole Miss: It's smooth sailing from this point forward for the Rebels, who could finish with 11 wins in the regular season and still not play for a conference championship due to certain tiebreakers and the two teams currently ahead of them in the league standings. That could be a blessing in disguise for Lane Kiffin, whose team would get extra rest before making their first playoff appearance.9. Georgia Tech: The Yellow Jackets' stunning loss at NC State on Saturday night is part of the reason why there's been worry associated with this team throughout ACC play. Brent Key's squad now has to deal with several tiebreaker scenarios depending on how the final few weeks shake out. In this projection, Georgia Tech gets to the ACC Championship Game and wins as the league's lone representative.10. Texas: If there's going to be a three-loss team getting to the playoff this season, we could see a \"last team in\" scenario from within the SEC. Perhaps that will be the Longhorns, who play two of the league's top squads -- Georgia and Texas A&M -- down the stretch and will finish 9-3 overall if they're able to split those.11. Notre Dame: It wasn't pretty, but the Fighting Irish accomplished the mission at Boston College and kept their pace to 10 wins -- the magic number for a team that's going to likely finish with only one win this season over top-25 competition. Another loss keeps Notre Dame out in favor of the Big 12 runner-up or potentially a 10-win Miami.12. Memphis: Running back Frank Peasant helped the Tigers build a 28-point lead in the second quarter of Friday night's win over Rice, assuring there would be not letdown following last week's momentum-building win over USF. The Tigers remain the Group of Five favorite heading in Week 11 and if they win out from here, will notch their first playoff appearance.\n            ",

The Ravens also had 217 yards on the ground in Week 14 versus Pittsburgh, so it has shown it can exploit the Steelers in that regard, and the latter already struggles in defending through the air as Pittsburgh ranks 29th in pass defense. Additionally, Baltimore held Pittsburgh to a season-low of 34 rushing yards in that earlier contest, while the Steelers failed to find the endzone without Metcalf on Sunday. Thus, there are multiple areas where Baltimore should excel over Pittsburgh, and one can't overlook that the Ravens are 4-1 ATS over their last five road games. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Steelers can coverPittsburgh has confidence in that it just beat the Ravens, in Baltimore, a month ago, and Aaron Rodgers has experienced nothing but success versus the Ravens. He's 4-0 versus the team over his career, making it one of two opponents he's undefeated against. Pittsburgh's success versus its rival extends beyond when Rodgers joined the team as the Steelers are 7-3 ATS versus Baltimore over their last 10 meetings. The Steelers' defense is also playing its best, allowing just 17.3 points over its last three games, and it is poised to get its best player back with T.J. Watt (lung) off the injury report and expected to return on Sunday night. Finally, Pittsburgh boasts the fifth-best turnover differential (plus-11), while Baltimore has the fifth-most giveaways (22). See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Steelers vs. Ravens  picksSportsLine's model has simulated Ravens vs. Steelers  10,000 times is going Over on the total, projecting 47 combined points.

Not only did Arsenal have four different goal-scorers in that match, but all four goals came in the second half, showing manager Mikel Areta's ability to make huge adjustments when needed in cagey matches. Arsenal continue to lead this league, and with each passing week it seems this team is synergizing more and more. I'm extremely impressed with how Arsenal looked against Aston Villa and expect them to keep their foot on the gas against a defensively leaky Bournemouth team.Bet Arsenal vs. Bournemouth at BetMGM Sportsbook, where new users get up to $1,500 in bonus bets back if their first wager doesn't win with the promo code CBSSPORTS:Arsenal's Defensive SetbacksWhile Arsenal's attack is finally clicking, both with their forwards and midfielders, we're seeing a bit of a pivot in how they're winning matches. This is a team that at the start of the season, showed elite levels of defensive fortitude, and 18 matches into the season they've conceded only 12 goals. The thing is, nine of those goals have been conceded over their last nine matches. We're seeing Arsenal stop playing for 1-0 cagey and defensive matches and starting to rely on their attack. Arsenal has now seen BTTS hit in four of their last five matches, while Bournemouth has seen it hit in four in a row. While Arsenal are the better team and should dominate once again for three big points, I expect Bournemouth to press, knowing this isn't a team you can stop, so goals should be flowing once again.\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe AP Offensive Rookie of the Year won't be announced until Feb. 5, but the leading candidates will make their final cases this weekend. According to current odds at DraftKings Sportsbook, the award is seemingly down to two candidates: Carolina Panthers receiver Tetairoa McMillan and New Orleans Saints quarterback Tyler Shough.At DraftKings, McMillan is the -175 favorite entering the final week of the regular season, while Shough is the +150 second choice. Patriots running back TreVeyon Henderson (+1200), Giants quarterback Jaxson Dart (+1400) and Buccaneers receiver Emeka Egbuka (+1600) round out the top five choices in the wagering but are considerable longshots.The case for McMillan to be the Offensive Rookie of the Year is strong. He leads all rookies in receiving touchdowns (seven), while ranking second in receiving yards (929) and third in receptions (66) for an 8-8 Panthers team that leads the division and can clinch a spot in the playoffs with either a win or tie against Tampa Bay (7-9) on Saturday or a Saints loss to the Falcons on Sunday. McMillan and Carolina are three-point underdogs in the latest odds from DraftKings to the Buccaneers.\nMeanwhile, Shough also has an argument to win the award. Since taking over the starting job for New Orleans in Week 9, the strong-armed quarterback has completed 69.6% of his passes for 1,997 yards and nine touchdowns against four interceptions. Most importantly, he has the Saints on a four-game winning streak, which is the franchise's longest in a single season since 2020. Shough and New Orleans are 3.5-point underdogs in the latest odds from DraftKings against Atlanta.\nBut there are two reasons why the betting value may still be on McMillan even though he's the favorite. First, he has a plus matchup against the Tampa Bay defense. Against this same defense just two weeks ago, he had six catches for 73 yards and a touchdown. The Buccaneers have one of the worst pass defenses in the league, allowing 236.4 yards per game through the air (26th in the league), and will be without cornerback Jamel Dean, who's out for Saturday with a shoulder injury.In addition, the structure of the voting could help McMillan. Voters are required to rank their top five Offensive Rookie of the Year candidates, and the players earn points on a 10-5-3-2-1 basis (10 points for a first-place vote, five for a second and so on). Past results show that voters favor players who play a full schedule versus those who play a shortened one. That could very well put McMillan, who has every game, on more ballots than Shough, who has played just 10 games and started eight of those.The -175 odds on McMillan to win the award translates to a 63.6% chance of winning, which means there's value to a bettor who believes McMillan's chance to win is roughly two-thirds or more.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        We have reached the College Football Playoff semifinals, and unlike last season when the favorites won all eight games in the first two rounds, we've seen some surprises this year. Gone are the likes of Ohio State, Georgia and Alabama. In are the upstarts like Indiana, Ole Miss and a Miami team that hasn't played on a stage like this in over 20 years.Between those three and Oregon, we are guaranteed to not only have a new national champion but a team that will win its first title in the CFP era. Of our final four teams, Miami is the only program to win a national title going back to the BCS era -- its last natty coming in 2001.For Ole Miss, you have to go back to 1960, which is the lone national title in program history. Indiana and Oregon? They've never won the national title. \n        \n            \n                College Football Playoff overreactions: Best postseason we've seen, Curt Cignetti on Hall of Fame track\n                \n                    Will Backus                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nNIL, the transfer portal and the College Football Playoff were supposed to bring us new blood, and it's hard to argue with the results right now, isn't it? So we're either re-crowning a long-dormant national power or welcoming a new power to the fold, but I'm not here to figure out who will take the trophy at the end right now. No, the point of our exercise today is to determine what the best possible title game matchups would be. To figure that out, I looked at the possibilities from multiple perspectives. How competitive would the game likely be? How does the matchup look? Who has the coolest uniforms? And, while I'm not a television executive, I also considered which matchup would be most appealing to a broader audience.\nHere are my highly scientific results.1. (5) Oregon vs. (10) MiamiOregon may not have a national title to its name, but it's not exactly a stranger to the stage. This is Oregon's third appearance in the CFP, and if it advances to the title game, it will be its second appearance in a national championship game since the start of the BCS era in 1998. Miami is the blue blood of the group. It has won a national title this century and has five in its history. While neither team is a television draw the likes of Ohio State or Alabama, they are known commodities in the college football world and would draw more \"casual\" eyeballs in this spot than any other possible combination. As for the matchup itself, the teams are quite similar. They have physical run games that look to punish you for 60 minutes but also have accurate quarterbacks who can get the ball to dangerous playmakers at the wide receiver position. They're also both led by coaches who put a strong emphasis on building their program from the lines of scrimmage out, though Dan Lanning is more aggressive when it comes to gameday decisions than Mario Cristobal. Oh, and that brings up another fun storyline for this game. Mario Cristobal left Oregon to take the job at Miami and was replaced by Lanning. There was a lot of talk about the possibility of a Carson Beck vs. Georgia's revenge game the last few weeks, but we all overlooked Mario vs. Oregon.\n2. (1) Indiana vs. (10) MiamiA lot of what I said about the football matchup between Oregon and Miami applies here as well. Indiana may not have a bunch of blue-chip prospects on their offensive and defensive lines, but go ahead and ask all those blue-chip teams it's beaten if they could tell the difference when facing them. The Hoosiers are just as mean as anybody, and I don't know that there's a defense in the country that takes as much joy in hitting ballcarriers as Indiana's does.Indiana also might have the best quarterback in the country. Fernando Mendoza won the Heisman Trophy for good reason and could be the first pick in the NFL Draft this spring. So that certainly brings some \"sizzle\" to the matchup for television purposes. Plus, you can always sell this as New Blood vs. Blue Blood.3. (5) Oregon vs. (6) Ole MissOf the four possible matchups, this is the one most likely to deliver us a shootout. Ole Miss has been involved in plenty of those all year, thanks to the likes of Trinidad Chambliss and an explosive offense. Lane Kiffin might be gone (oh, the irony of leaving for LSU to compete for national championships while then watching the team you just left do that), but he didn't take the offense with him. Ole Miss has scored 80 points through its first two playoff games after averaging 37.6 during the regular season.\nOregon has shown more versatility. It can win a rock fight, but it's also one of the most explosive offenses in the country. It has scored 40 points or more seven times this season and has cracked the 50-point mark four times.4. (1) Indiana vs. (6) Ole MissThis is the matchup that would have the largest spread. I don't know where the final odds would be by the time the game came around, but using my power ratings, I'd have Indiana as roughly a 10-point favorite here. Of course, if this game happens, Ole Miss will have reached the title game after beating both Georgia and Miami as underdogs in the quarters and semis, so it's not a position where the Rebels would be afraid.Still, while I'll be happy to watch this game if it's the one we get. The blowout potential here is higher than anywhere else, which makes it the least appealing. Yes, there's the angle of neither team having won or competed for national titles in the modern era before, but like Indiana, Oregon hasn't won a national title either, so the novelty doesn't carry much weight.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        It wasn't supposed to be like this for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.Over the first six weeks of the season, the Buccaneers were at the top of the NFC South and quarterback Baker Mayfield was in MVP discussions as he kept the Bucs offense afloat while All-Pro left tackle Tristan Wirfs, running back Bucky Irving and wide receivers Mike Evans and Chris Godwin all missed time with injury. They were eighth in points per drive, seventh in EPA per play and sitting at 5-1 with a win over the Seattle Seahawks in Seattle.However, since Week 7, the Bucs have fallen off a cliff, and now find themselves needing a win on Saturday against the Panthers and some help if they want to win the division for the fifth straight year. Over this same time span, the Bucs are 26th in EPA per play on offense, 25th in points per drive and have lost eight of their last 10 games, including a \"Thursday Night Football\" loss to the Atlanta Falcons that made Todd Bowles give an expletive-laden statement about the team postgame, and recently a baffling loss to the moribund Miami Dolphins.  So how did this team go from early Super Bowl contenders to potentially out of the playoffs completely? It comes down to a bad mixture of problems on offense.On the offensive side of the ball, it's easy to point to the various injuries as why the Bucs offense has fallen apart, and you would be correct to an extent. Mayfield is playing through a shoulder injury, Wirfs has been in and out of the lineup, Evans was on IR from weeks 8-15 and Irving is just now getting close to 100% after shoulder and foot injuries during the season. However, I think all of the injuries have papered over a larger issue with the offense lately: it feels like there's no trust between anyone on that side of the ball. The offensive coordinator doesn't trust his offensive line or QB, the QB doesn't trust the line or his playcaller, receivers aren't running the right routes. It's all been bad for Tampa Bay and that lack of trust has been evident on tape. \nLet's start with the QB and passing game. Yes, Mayfield has been hurt, but it doesn't help that he's playing entirely too wound up. Mayfield is playing amped up because of the idea of pressure and getting hit, and it's causing mistakes. Take one of his interceptions he threw against Miami, for example. The Dolphins are running a non-traditional Tampa 2 coverage, and the Bucs have the perfect play to beat it, with wide receiver Jalen McMillan coming over the top on a big post. Mayfield throws a pick despite making the correct decision to throw because he bails on a clean pocket and throws off the timing. Because this pass is late, it allows cornerback Jason Marshall Jr to make a play on the ball.\nOn this play, Mayfield ends up scrambling for a first down, but the throw is there for Evans as the over the ball route on mesh. Mayfield sees it, but opts for a scramble instead. While it's a good result, it's a bad process and makes you worry about the 2025 version of this Bucs offense.\nMayfield's accuracy has also taken a stark dip post-Week 7, hampering the passing game even more. From weeks 1-7, Mayfield's on-target rate was 73.7%, not a super high number but still one that would qualify for a starting QB in the NFL. Since then, that number has dropped to 69.3%, which is incredibly concerning and also shows up on the tape. \nWhere completion percentage is sort of overused when it comes to QB stats, on-target rate measures how often the pass hits the receiver in stride, regardless of whether the pass is broken up or not. While Mayfield has also not been incredibly accurate, the entire offense has also entered the tank. On top of some odd timing and design on play calls by offensive coordinator Josh Grizzard, the receiver corps has also just been bad. This is the exact same play that Mayfield missed Evans on, a mesh concept where Evans is the over the ball route. However, the linebacker causes a collision with Godwin, and Emeka Egbuka also collides with the linebacker. So you end up with three receivers in one area, stacked on top of each other like LEGOs. Not exactly how you draw it up.\nTampa's offensive woes this season go beyond just not being healthy. Yes, Mayfield has dealt with a litany of injuries, but he also can't continue to play this way for the offense to be at its best. Mayfield is reckless, that's part of what makes him such fun to watch. However, he chooses too often to put his body on the line and sacrifices potential big gains through the air to put his already injured body through a whole lot more pain. Admirable, but also far too reckless for a Bucs team that has more than just playoff aspirations.\nThe biggest thing Grizzard can do for Mayfield is telling him to chill out, honestly. Giving him more easy looks in the passing game that accentuate his strengths as a passer (strong arm to throw outside the hashes, growing as a passer in the middle of the field) and allowing for the offensive skill-position players to help him out now that they're healthy and in the lineup together. Part of that is leaning on the run game, and that comes with its own set of problems. Without most of the aces on the offensive line in the lineup, Tampa can't push around teams like it did last season, but the intentionality in design behind the run game has been lacking this season. With former OC Liam Coen out the door, the run game hasn't popped as much, forcing the offense into some rough situations. Grizzard could use Irving and Sean Tucker in space more often, where their vision might be better this season.Time is running out for the Bucs to find an answer, with their season on the line against the Panthers on Saturday. If Tampa Bay winds up on the outside looking in come playoff time, its offense will be asking what could've been.\n            ",

Brock Purdy and the offense are rolling along, helping make up for a defense that is decimated by injuries. The Niners should be getting George Kittle back in the lineup for this game, so they'll at least be back to full strength on offense.Seattle enters the game as the top seed in the NFC and having also won six straight. The Seahawks are powered by their elite defense, which smothered the Carolina Panthers last week during the team's latest win. The Seahawks knew coming into that contest that if they won out, they got the top seed in the conference, and the same remains true -- as it does for the 49ers.\n        \n            \n                Brock Purdy has traded game managing for dancing -- and the 49ers' Super Bowl window is wide open\n                \n                    Douglas Clawson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhich of these two teams will claim the NFC West and the No. 1 seed in the NFC? We'll find out soon enough. But before we break down some key storylines, here's a look at how you can watch the game.Where to watch 49ers vs. Seahawks liveDate: Saturday, Jan. 3 | Time: 8 p.m. ETLocation: Levi's Stadium (Santa Clara, California)TV: ABC/ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free) Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Seahawks -1.5, O/U 47.5 via DraftKings Sportsbook\nKey storylinesPlayoff picture. It's been talked about ad nauseam at this point, but it's still worth noting: The winner of this game wins both the NFC West and the No. 1 seed in the NFC, along with the first-round bye that comes with said slot. If the Seahawks win, the 49ers can actually drop as low as the No. 6 seed if the Rams beat the Cardinals. But if the Niners win, then the Seahawks will be the No. 5 seed and the Rams will be in the 6 spot.49ers offense. San Francisco's offense is on fire during its six-game winning streak, and especially across the three games since it returned from a Week 14 bye. Against the Titans, Colts and Bears, the Niners put up at least 430 yards, 28 first downs and 37 points in each game. They've averaged 455 yards, 29.3 first downs and 42.3 points per week during those contests. They struggled relative to that explosiveness in the first matchup against the Seahawks, though they did still put up 384 yards and 24 first downs, albeit while scoring only 17 points because they turned the ball over twice. Sam Darnold's turnovers. Darnold leads the NFL in giveaways this season, having thrown 14 interceptions and fumbled 10 times, losing six of them. He's turned it over at least once in four of the last five games, and twice in each of the last two. The Niners have had to rely on takeaways in recent weeks, forcing two or more in four of the six games during their six-game winning streak. If Darnold can't take care of the ball, that's a very bad sign for the Seattle offense.CMC's quests. There have only been four seasons in NFL history where a player has run for over 1,000 yards and caught at least 100 passes. Christian McCaffrey is responsible for two of those seasons, having accomplished the feat in both 2018 and 2019. He can do it again if he catches at least four passes on Sunday. McCaffrey is also 110 receiving yards away from a second career 1,000-1,000 season. That's only been done three times in history. The 110 receiving yards part seems pretty unlikely, but four catches is well within the realm of possibility.Prediction\nSan Francisco won this game early in the season, and that was before the Niners got on the roll they are on right now, where the offense is firing on all cylinders. Couple that with the fact that the Seattle offense hasn't been nearly as efficient or explosive as of late as it was earlier in the year, and I find it hard to believe that the Seahawks are going to go into Santa Clara and come away with the victory. Especially if George Kittle is good to go, I like the 49ers -- even though their defense probably lets Seattle's offense also get back on track.  \nPrediction: 49ers 30, Seahawks 27\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Week 18 will kick off Saturday afternoon from Tampa where the Buccaneers (7-9) and Carolina Panthers (8-8) will square off with the NFC South division title and the conference's No. 4 postseason seed on the line.The host Buccaneers are seeking to become the first NFC team to win five consecutive division titles since the 1990s' Dallas Cowboys dynasty (1992-1996), and in doing so, they would own the longest division title streak by any NFC South team since the 2022 divisional realignment. The visiting Panthers are seeking their first playoff appearance since 2017 and their first division title since 2015 when they won the NFC and played in Super Bowl 50. Both squads enter the final week of the regular season stumbling into their division-deciding matchup. Tampa Bay is on a four-game losing streak and has lost seven of its last eight games after a 6-2 start. Meanwhile, Carolina has been a rollercoaster all season, going 10 consecutive games alternating a win and a loss, which is tied for the fourth-longest such streak of all time. \n        \n            \n                NFL Week 18 odds, predictions, expert picks: Can Panthers win NFC South?

The Buccaneers need to win and have the New Orleans Saints beat the Atlanta Falcons in order to clinch the 2025 NFC South title. Even if Tampa Bay wins, should the Falcons win, there would be a three-way tie for the NFC South -- a tie that Carolina would win. \nWhere to watch Panthers vs. BuccaneersDate: Saturday, Jan. 3 | Time: 4:30 p.m. ETLocation: Raymond James Stadium (Tampa, Florida)TV: ABC/ESPN | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Buccaneers -3, O/U 43.5 (via DraftKings Sportsbook)\nPanthers vs. Buccaneers: Need to knowWhich Baker Mayfield will show up? \nBaker Mayfield's 2025 season has been a rollercoaster. He was on fire through the first six games of the year, throwing 12 touchdowns to just one interception, and the Buccaneers won five of their first six games as a result. The last 10 weeks, Mayfield underwent an epic collapse with 13 touchdowns to nine interceptions, playing a major role in Tampa Bay losing eight of their last 10 games, including the last four in a row. One of those defeats was a 23-20 loss at the Panthers in Week 16 two weeks ago. He threw for 145 yards, one touchdown and one interception on 18 of 26 passing with the interception sealing the game's outcome with 49 seconds left to play. Carolina only blitzed Mayfield on six of his 12 dropbacks in that game with the two-time Pro Bowler completing one of his three throws for a 1-yard touchdown pass to Mike Evans. Perhaps the Panthers opt to break tendency and blitz Mayfield a little more on Saturday. On the season, Carolina possesses a 29.2% blitz rate, right around league average at the 15th-highest rate. Mayfield has been a mess this season against the blitz with the second-lowest completion percentage (50.7%), the lowest yards per pass attempt (5.2) and the second-lowest passer rating (69.4) against it in 2025. \nBaker Mayfield this seasonFirst 6 gamesLast 10 gamesW-L5-12-8Comp Pct66.2%60.7%Pass YPG 256.5195.1TD-INT12-113-9Passer Rating108.579.4Will Bryce Young be able to repeat his Week 16 performance against the Buccaneers? \nTwo weeks ago in a 23-20 home win over the Buccaneers, Carolina Panthers quarterback Bryce Young played one of his best games of the season, completing 21 of his 32 throws for 191 yards and two passing touchdowns. However, Young and his supporting cast melted down against the top-seeded Seattle Seahawks in Charlotte in Week 17: he threw 54 yards, his fewest in any start of his three-year career, and an interception on 14 of 24 passing. Young's 29 career starts with fewer than 200 yards passing are the fourth-most by a quarterback in their first three seasons since the 1970 AFL/NFL merger. He thrived against Tampa Bay throwing short, completing 16 of his 18 passes on throws of under 10 air yards for 101 yards passing. Young hit two of his three throws on 20-plus air yards for 56 yards and a score, including a 22-yard touchdown to rookie first-round wide receiver Tetairoa McMillan. He'll need to pull off a couple of those explosive plays to McMillan to keep the Buccaneers' defense honest. Otherwise, he could have a second consecutive long afternoon. Can Jaycee Horn make a game-changing play?\nJaycee Horn, Carolina's two-time Pro Bowl cornerback, is having a career year. His five interceptions are a career-high, and they're tied for the second-most in the NFL with all five coming on deep throws, passes of 20 or more air yards. In the Week 16 matchup against Tampa Bay, Mayfield didn't throw his as Horn wasn't targeted on 29 coverage snaps. That stands as the only game of Horn's career with a minimum of 15 coverage snaps and no targets.  He covered Buccaneers wide receiver Mike Evans on seven matchups, wide receiver Chris Godwin on five matchups and wide receiver Jalen McMillan on three matchups per NFL Pro. If Horn can make a play to reel in his sixth interception of the season, the Panthers will likely clinch the NFC South title. The Buccaneers are 0-8 in games that Mayfield throws an interception this season. Panthers vs. Buccaneers prediction, pick\nTampa Bay has won five consecutive home games against Carolina with their last loss against the visiting Panthers coming all the way back in 2019. That streak ends on Saturday. Horn will intercept Mayfield to set up Young with advantageous field position to throw a game-winning touchdown pass to McMillan for a one-score win. Pick: Panthers 24, Buccaneers 20 | (Panthers +3, Over 43.5)\n            ",

    "body": "\n        As winds picked up on Friday, PGA National started to show a bit more of its teeth, and the conditions that produced some incredibly low scores gave way to a greater challenge in the second round of the 2026 Cognizant Classic. Still sitting atop the leaderboard going into Saturday is Austin Smotherman, one of the few players who ended Thursday on the first page of the leaderboard.Smotherman backed up his strong play with a quality round Friday, extending his lead from one to three shots thanks to a solid 69 that put him 11 under par. Few players were able to mount a real charge on a difficult day. While it wasn't as dynamic a round as his 62 on Thursday, Smotherman acquitted himself well in the tougher conditions on Friday afternoon. Most of the best scores of the day were posted in the morning, and Smotherman's 69 was among the better rounds of the later wave. Unsurprisingly, his approach play was the first thing to falter in the wind, but the putter stayed warm with another day with more than 2 strokes gained on the field on the greens. This bomb for birdie on No. 17 did some of the heavy lifting. \nWith two excellent rounds in the books, Smotherman is in the driver's seat to pick up the first win of his PGA Tour career going into the weekend. He's been boom or bust to start the 2026 PGA Tour season, with just one made cut in his first four events, a T8 at The American Express. Now he looks poised to not only pick up a second top 10 of the season but also a potential career-changing victory. \nWhile Smotherman was extending his lead at the top of the leaderboard, some of the biggest names in the field came into Friday's second round needing serious improvement just to make the weekend. Brooks Koepka, Max Homa and Ryan Gerard all entered Friday over par and outside the projected cut, but each posted rounds in the mid-60s on Friday to punch their tickets to the final 36 holes. Gerard entered the week in unfamiliar territory as the pre-tournament favorite, and while he struggled to produce his best on Thursday, a 67 on Friday got him into red figures at 2 under and two more rounds of golf this weekend. Homa and Koepka, meanwhile, shot matching 66s as they continue to try to create the spark that can help them capture past form. For Homa, it was his iron play coming to life that led to his second-round surge, as he gained more than 3.3 strokes on the field approaching the green. Once a premier ball-striker on the PGA Tour, Homa has slipped significantly of late, but Friday brought a reminder of what he's capable of achieving when he gets in a good swing rhythm. \nKoepka, meanwhile, has been one of the worst putters on the PGA Tour this season in his return. He came into the week 171st in strokes gained putting and was 111th on Thursday on his way to a 74. His putting turned around in a major way on Friday, as he poured in 131 feet and 3 inches of putts in the second round -- the most of anyone in the field -- picking up nearly 4 strokes on the greens. After his round, he credited a setup change he made after his first round struggles that turned around his fortunes, despite, in his mind, hitting the ball worse on Friday.\"Just may hand position at setup,\" Koepka said. \"I was just cheating it. Changed the stroke a little bit. I'm not getting as handsy, and I was cheating it by getting my hands back, and it just was creating an inconsistent feel. Where I thought it was taking off, it wasn't.\"\nReplicating that exact kind of putting performance will be nearly impossible, but for a player who hasn't been able to get anything to drop all year, having a day where the putter gets red-hot could be huge for his confidence on the greens -- especially after putting a new putter in the bag this year.Leader1. Austin Smotherman (-12): The winds are supposed to settle down again on Saturday before picking back up on Sunday, and the field will be starting play early due to potential storms in the area. That means, if Smotherman is going to maintain a comfortable lead going into the final round, he'll need to keep the pedal down on Moving Day in solid conditions. We've seen that low scores are available at PGA National since they've made some recent changes to the setup, and Smotherman will need to stay on the front foot with an eye on another round in the 60s rather than simply trying to hold on for 36 holes. Contenders2. Taylor Moore (-8)T3. Nico Echavarria, A.J. Ewart (-7)5. Joel Dahmen (-6)T6. Shane Lowry, Aaron Rai and four others (-5)T12. Daniel Berger and five others (-4)T18. Max Homa and eight others (-3) \nEwart posted the round of the day on Friday to thrust himself into contention after starting the second set of 18 holes at even par. His 64 paced the field in scoring, and now, he finds himself in unfamiliar territory with a late tee time on the weekend for the first time in his young career. Echavarria started Friday one back of Smotherman, but he struggled in the more challenging conditions and moved backwards a spot on the leaderboard. Even with that minor setback, Echavarria is certainly a threat going into the weekend, particularly with the forecast for Saturday looking more like Thursday when he fired a 63. Lurking a bit further back are some notable names like Joel Dahmen, Shane Lowry, Aaron Rai and Daniel Berger. Dahmen has put together consecutive rock-solid 68s, but if he's going to contend, he'll need to take it a bit deeper and find some more birdies to get in the mix. Lowry has made the cut at the Cognizant for nine straight starts and loves PGA National, so don't count him out if he can get the putter warmed up and see some fall early on Saturday. Players won't have to look far to find a reason for optimism heading into the weekend trailing, as Joe Highsmith won last year after making the cut on the number. That required a pair of weekend 64s, and he was only eight shots off the lead, not 11, but everyone will know what's possible, and we ought to see some extremely aggressive play early on Saturday with the winds down. \nNotable players who missed the cutLuke Clanton (+1)Webb Simpson (+1)Michael Thorbjornsen (+1)Neal Shipley (+2)Gary Woodland (+2)Chris Kirk (+2)Stephan Jaeger (+2)A late move on Friday afternoon shifted the cut line from +1 to Even, which dropped a huge group of players from the weekend. Some of the rising young stars of the game were included in that group, as Luke Clanton, Michael Thorbjornsen and Neal Shipley (who bogeyed his last, trying to make a birdie to get to the weekend) all narrowly missed out.Updated 2026 Cognizant Classic odds, picksOdds via Caesars SportsbookAustin Smotherman (7/4)Taylor Moore (7-1)Nico Echavarria (19/2)Shane Lowry (12-1)A.J. Ewart (17-1)Joel Dahmen (18-1)Aaron Rai (20-1)We'll see how Smotherman handles the nerves of being the 36-hole leader in pursuit of his first career win. The nature of this course (with the current setup) is going to make it so someone from the chase pack reels him in. Echavarria, despite a rough Friday, has a good chance to post another low round on Saturday and get in position for a win, and Lowry's comfort on this course should keep him in the mix all the way through Sunday afternoon. \n            ",

Jiri Prochazka and Carlos Ulberg will battle for the vacant light heavyweight championship inside Kaseya Center in Miami on April 11. UFC president and CEO Dana White made the fight official with an announcement on Friday night.The title was vacated by Alex Pereira, who was on his second run as light heavyweight champion after having previously held the middleweight title, in anticipation of a move to the heavyweight division.Prochazka is aiming for his own second stint as champion at 205 pounds, having previously won the title with a win over Glover Teixeira at UFC 275. Prochazka lost the belt in his first defense, suffering a TKO defeat to Pereira. Prochazka then lost a rematch for the title against Pereira two fights later.Prochazka has been perfect in his UFC career outside of the two defeats to Pereira, compiling a 6-2 record in the Octagon with all victories coming via stoppage. He has won back-to-back fights, stopping Jamahal Hill via TKO and then scoring a dramatic comeback knockout of Khalil Rountree Jr. this past October.\nUlberg stumbled in his UFC debut, suffering a knockout loss to Kennedy Nzechukwu. Since that loss, Ulberg has rattled off nine consecutive victories, most recently knocking out Dominick Reyes in a UFC Fight Night main event.\nProchazka and Ulberg sit at No. 2 and 3, respectively, in the official UFC light heavyweight rankings, sitting only behind No. 1 Magomed Ankalaev.Prochazka vs. Ulberg tops a card that also includes a flyweight title defense between champion Joshua Van and challenger Tatsuro Taira.White also announced on Friday that former Bellator two-division champion Patricio Pitbull would return in Miami to take on a familiar name in Aaron Pico as both men spent years with the promotion. The two will meet at featherweight on the prelims. \nHere's how the rest of the card shakes out.UFC 327 fight cardJiri Prochazka vs. Carlos Ulberg, vacant light heavyweight championshipJoshua Van (c)\tvs.\tTatsuro Taira, flyweight championshipCurtis Blaydes\tvs.\tJosh Hokit, heavyweightsBeneil Dariush vs. Manuel Torres, lightweightsDominick Reyes vs. Johnny Walker, light heavyweightsAzamat Murzakanov vs. Paulo Costa, light heavyweightsPatricio Pitbull vs. Aaron Pico, featherweightsMatuesz Gamrot vs. Esteban Ribovics, lightweightsCub Swanson vs. Nate Landwehr, featherweightsKevin Holland\tvs.\tRandy Brown, welterweightsKelvin Gastelum vs. Vicente Luque, welterweightsTatiana Suarez\tvs.\tLoopy Godinez, women's strawweightsKyle Daukaus\tvs.\tVicente Luque, middleweights Christopher Alvidrez vs. Francisco Prado welterweights\n            \n",

The Spanish giants are currently at the top of the standings with a one-point margin over Real Madrid and a ten-point gap to Villarreal, one of the most positive surprises in LaLiga's season so far. During the pre-match press conference, Flick revealed an interesting detail on why he stopped benching players who arrived late to training, as was hinted at by both Pedri and Ferran Torres over the week. \"Before, it was stressful because I'd look at the clock when there were 60 seconds left and think, 'Let's see when they'll arrive.' It's something I don't like because it's also pressure for me, so I decided to talk to the captains and leave the decision up to them.

The win brings Miami within two victories of completing a perfect regular season.It took everything the RedHawks could muster amid adverse circumstances on the road to avoid what would have been a potentially devastating Quad 4 loss. Miami didn't earn its first lead of the second half until the 1:45 mark as it navigated life without two stars. Leading scorer Peter Suder fouled out with 7:03 remaining and the RedHawks down 57-50. He had 18 points on 7 of 13 shooting, and his departure after just 27 minutes of playing time left the RedHawks in a bind. The Redhawks also played without starting point guard Luke Skaljac due to injury. But when the pressure was on, Miami demonstrated the clutch gene that has been part of its DNA all season. Perry finished with 14 points on 6 of 8 shooting. Almar Atlason added 16 points, including 12 in the second half. His 4-point play with 3:26 remaining sliced a 5-point deficit to just one.\nMiami entered as an 11.5-point favorite but struggled from the jump as Western Michigan built a 6-point lead in the opening minutes. WMU closed the first half on a 7-0 run as Miami coach Travis Steele began to take exception with the officiating.\nHe ultimately received a technical foul and went to the locker in a fit of rage. Western Michigan then built a 9-point lead before Miami figured out a way to claw back and keep its storybook start alive. The RedHawks close the regular season next week against Toledo and Ohio as they seek to become the first team since Gonzaga in 2021 to finish the regular season unbeaten.\n            \n",

    "body": "\n        CHAMPAIGN, Ill. — A big 'ol party erupted in the bowels of the State Farm Center just moments after No. 3 Michigan dominated No. 10 Illinois 84-70 Friday to clinch the Big Ten regular-season championship outright. Michigan coach Dusty May was chest-bumping anybody and everybody he could find. Aday Mara, a 7-foot-3 mountain of a man, galloped down the ramp smacking his ring finger, begging for his championship hardware. Illinois transfer Morez Johnson, who endured three hours of tongue-lashing and a barrage of, uh, unkind texts after his phone number was leaked, carried his Big Ten Championship trophy into the opposing locker room like a king with his prize. In the middle of the madhouse, Nimari Burnett could only think of one term that's littered across Michigan's walls: \"Those who stay will be champions.\" The all-time phrase was coined by Bo Schembechler, Michigan's Hall of Fame football coach, and it embodies plenty of what makes this Michigan group tick.Two years ago, Burnett and Will Tschetter had to sit in this exact locker room in Champaign and stare at the walls after a 97-68 beatdown at the hands of Illinois All-American Terrence Shannon. It was one of many drubbings in an 8-24 season that resulted in Juwan Howard's termination.\n        \n            \n                Bracketology Bubble Watch: Which teams near the NCAA Tournament cut line need a victory the most?\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"We have a lot of memories in that locker room; none of them good,\" Tschetter told CBS Sports. \"For us to come back in here and get this dub in this fashion and clinch that thing outright, it means the world. Very, very cool.\"\nThe Dusty May era may have ushered in a wave of hope for Michigan basketball, but there was real consternation for both Burnett and Tschetter about what was in store with a new regime.\tDo they want us?\tWill we get to play?\"When you're on a team that's 8-24, you think,  'Oh, man, they might want to clear house,'\" Tschetter says. \"But you know, after talking with him, we were on the same wavelength. … You can't put a price on some things and this is one of those things for sure. Having the trust and the relationship with Dusty and the guys that he was gonna bring in, I truly thought we'd be Big Ten championship contenders and Final Four contenders. You can't put a price on that. So super obviously thankful for him to be a part of this.\"Burnett and Tschetter didn't just stay. They've become pillars of this squad. Burnett has started all 29 games and has embraced his 3-and-D role. Tschetter is the ninth man on some nights and the seventh man on others. His attitude doesn't appear to change regardless if he plays seven minutes or 17 like he did Friday.\nThey both knocked down treys in the second half to deliver Michigan's knockout punch.\"We kept those guys because we believed in who they are as people, first and foremost,\" May said. \"That was a tough season for Michigan basketball, and there was a handful of guys that we couldn't recruit for various reasons. And then there's a handful that we thought might fit our culture as far as work ethic and talent. They had a baseline of talent, but Nimari and Will were both guys who dove in from Day One, and they wanted Michigan to be back in this position. It was that simple.\"There was never a conversation as far as shots. As far as position. They've taken both of those guys have taken a major, major, sacrifice for this group. You know, Nimari played point guard on that team. \nNow he's probably our fifth playmaker on the team because Aday [Mara], Elliot [Cadeau], and the rest of these guys. Will Tschetter has been an absolute star from Day One with the role-playing and the daily intangibles. We wouldn't be here without those guys.\"Burnett says he knew this Michigan group was special back in September. The size, the power, the physicality. All of it. \"Although that's easy to say now,\" Burnett says with a laugh.Burnett's visions have come to life, and they were punctuated with March looming. Michigan's two-way paint dominance was on full display. Johnson was utterly unstoppable on his way to 19 points and 11 rebounds. Mara delivered maybe the best game of his season, considering the stakes. Mara dominated the second half with 19 points and numerous thunderous dunks. \nThe bully of the Big Ten added yet another thing to its ever-growing list of accomplishments. It's Michigan that is the undisputed champ. \"I stayed for days just like this,\" Burnett said. \"Believing in Dusty May. Believing in the staff, knowing that they have a great plan. know how to win at a high level, you know, and know how to maximize us as players. And that's this is what it's all about, right? It's about winning, doing it together, enjoying these moments.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Road to WrestleMania has reached its final prelude. WWE has just one PPV left before the greatest show of them all in April and that's the Elimination Chamber. WWE returns to Chicago on Saturday night for the epic event where two superstars will punch their ticket to WrestleMania 42 by outlasting five others inside the sadistic structure. The men's match has some massive names looking to return to a headlining role at WrestleMania (Cody Rhodes, Randy Orton and Jey Uso) but it also has some men looking to make their mark and earn their first headlining spot (LA Knight, Je'Von Evans and Trick Williams).On the women's side, four former champions are set to compete in Tiffany Stratton, Rhea Ripley, Alexa Bliss and Asuka while two newer competitors look to make a splash in Kiana James and Raquel Rodriguez.\nThe other two matches are near and dear to the fans in Chicago. World heavyweight champion CM Punk puts his title on the line in front of his hometown fans when he takes on Finn Balor. And Punk's wife, AJ Lee, challenges Becky Lynch for the women's intercontinental title in her first singles match in more than a decade.Take a look below at the confirmed matches for Elimination Chamber and take a glance at the crystal ball of what may come. The event streams live on ESPN Unlimited on Saturday with the main card starting at 6 p.m. ET.2026 WWE Elimination Chamber matchesWorld Heavyweight Championship -- CM Punk (c) vs. Finn Balor: Balor returned to the main event scene after Judgment Day ally Liv Morgan accused him of complacency. Balor fell short of defeating the world heavyweight champion in Balor's home nation of Ireland. The respect Punk and Balor showed each other after the match fizzled out after Balor was denied a rematch by Raw general manager Adam Pearce. Balor took matters into his own hands, attacking Punk and provoking the champ into granting him a rematch.\nElimination Chamber match -- Randy Orton vs. LA Knight vs. Cody Rhodes vs. Je'Von Evans vs. Trick Williams vs. Jey Uso: An undisputed WWE title shot awaits the winner of the men's Elimination Chamber match. Orton qualified by beating Aleister Black and Solo Sikoa in a triple threat match. Knight defeated Austin Theory and Penta to earn his spot. After Rhodes earned his spot with a win over Jacob Fatu and Sami Zayn, Evans became the biggest surprise entrant in the match by defeating Gunther and Dominik Mysterio on Raw. Williams earned the penultimate spot by beating Carmelo Hayes and Damian Priest. Uso was the final man to qualify, partially as a result of a legitimate injury suffered by Bronson Reed during the qualifying match against Uso and El Grande Americano.Women's Intercontinental Championship -- Becky Lynch (c) vs. AJ Lee: Punk isn't the only adored superstar coming home to Chicago. Lee seeks to join her husband as an active champion at Elimination Chamber. Lynch proposed the match, but only agreed to defend her women's intercontinental title after Lee refused to wrestle her otherwise. Lee is 2-0 against Lynch since ending her 10-year retirement, beating her in a mixed tag team match and in WarGames.Elimination Chamber match -- Rhea Ripley vs. Tiffany Stratton vs. Alexa Bliss vs. Asuka vs. Kiana James vs. Raquel Rodriguez: Stratton advanced to the Elimination Chamber by beating Lash Legend and Chelsea Green on SmackDown. Ripley qualified by overcoming Lyra Valkyria and Ivy Nile on Raw. Bliss defeated Giulia and Zelina Vega to grab a spot in the match, and was joined by Asuka, who defeated Bayley and Nattie. James snuck a pinfall over Charlotte Flair in their match with Nia Jax. Rodriguez has the chance to join Judgment Day Liv Morgan in challenging for a world championship at WrestleMania after defeating Iyo Sky and Kairi Sane in the final qualifier.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        George Pickens had a career season in his first year in Dallas in 2025. Now, we could get a repeat performance in 2026 after the Cowboys placed the non-exclusive franchise tag on Pickens on Friday.Under the non-exclusive franchise tag, Pickens can negotiate with other teams, but Dallas has the right to match any offer. And both sides will still have until mid-July to negotiate a potential multi-year deal, which is something the Cowboys have expressed interest in doing. If no long-term extension is finalized, Pickens will play out the 2026 campaign on a one-year, $28.8 million contract, which is fully guaranteed.We hope this contract situation doesn't get messy and cause Pickens to miss any time in training camp. If he remains with the Cowboys as expected then he has the chance to be a low-end No. 1 Fantasy receiver in all leagues, and he will be worth drafting as early as Round 3.Pickens came to Dallas prior to last season in a trade from Pittsburgh, and it was a fantastic deal for the Cowboys. He had career highs in catches (93), yards (1,429), touchdowns (nine) and targets (137), and he played all 17 games. He averaged a career-best 17.2 PPR points per game, which was No. 6 behind Puka Nacua, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Ja'Marr Chase, Amon-Ra St. Brown and Rashee Rice.\nPickens had five games with more than 100 yards receiving, and he set a franchise record with five games of at least 130 yards receiving and a touchdown. According to ESPN, his 13 catches of at least 25 yards and 73 first-down receptions ranked in the top five in the NFL.Now, while Pickens was great all season, he was a dominant force when CeeDee Lamb missed three games and the majority of another from Weeks 3-6 with an ankle injury. Pickens scored at least 17.8 PPR points in three of those four games and averaged 24.2 PPR points over that span, with five touchdowns.Pickens staying in Dallas isn't great news for Lamb, who had a down year in 2025. He finished the season with 75 catches for 1,077 yards and three touchdowns on 117 targets in 14 games, and he averaged just 14.4 PPR points per game. It was his lowest reception and yardage total since his rookie season in 2020, and this was the worst touchdown total of his career.\nWe're counting on Lamb to bounce back in 2026, even with Pickens on the roster, and he should be drafted no later than Round 2 in the majority of leagues. But Lamb is no longer in the same tier as Nacua, Smith-Njigba, Chase and St. Brown, and you shouldn't reach for Lamb on Draft Day.Pickens' return is great news for Dak Prescott, who passed for 4,552 yards, 30 touchdowns and 10 interceptions in 2025, along with 177 rushing yards and two touchdowns. He averaged 21.9 Fantasy points per game, which was No. 7 among quarterbacks behind Matthew Stafford, Josh Allen, Drake Maye, Brock Purdy, Patrick Mahomes and Trevor Lawrence.This was the third time in Prescott's career that he passed for at least 4,500 yards and fourth time with at least 30 touchdowns. With his elite duo of receivers back, Prescott is worth drafting as a No. 1 Fantasy quarterback in all leagues with a mid-round pick.\nThe Cowboys have been aggressive so far this offseason by using the franchise tag on Pickens and signing Javonte Williams to a contract extension. Dallas should once again be a standout offense, and we like that as Fantasy managers.We'll continue to monitor the situation for Pickens and if he'll get a long-term contract. As long as he doesn't hold out in training camp, Pickens has the chance to once again be an awesome Fantasy receiver in 2026.\n            ",

    "body": "\nFlash back to Jan. 10, 2019. Brad Underwood was in just his second season as coach of the Fighting Illini. John Beilein was in his final season as coach of the Wolverines, and Illinois and Michigan were led in scoring by — wait for it — Ignas Brazdeikis and Trent Frazier, respectively.The second-ranked Wolverines beat the Illini, 79-69, that night in Champaign, Ill. That is noteworthy because that is the last time Michigan has beaten Illinois in men's basketball.The Illinois Fighting Illini have won nine in a row against the Michigan Wolverines, and it is with that backdrop that No. 3 Michigan and No. 10 Illinois meet tonight at the State Farm Center in Champaign. If the Wolverines (26-2, 16-1 in Big Ten) can stop the nine-game losing streak, they would clinch the outright conference regular season title. They are coming off a 77-67 victory over Minnesota on Tuesday.Meanwhile, the Illini (22-6, 13-4) are looking to bounce back from a 95-94 overtime loss at UCLA on Saturday. The team sits in a three-way tie for second in the Big Ten, with Michigan State and Nebraska. Michigan is a slight 1.5-point favorite over Illinois on Friday.While Wolverines vs. Illini is the marquee attraction on Friday, there are other options on a sporting landscape that includes five NBA games and a partial college basketball schedule. Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Friday, Feb. 27. All times Eastern.College basketball best bets, where to watchNo. 3 Michigan at No. 10 IllinoisTime: 8 p.m. | Location: Champaign, Ill. | TV: FOX | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Illinois +1.5 | Expert: Illinois -105 (Chip Patterson)\nAs Duke showed last weekend, the Wolverines are not unbeatable. The Blue Devils knocked off then No. 1-ranked Michigan by controlling the boards and preventing second shots, outrebounding the Wolverines 41-28. That bodes well for Illinois, which ranks sixth in the country in rebound margin (10.6 rebounds per game). The SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every game 10,000 times, says the Illini have a 75.0% chance to cover and assigns a B grade to Illinois +1.5. Meanwhile Patterson notes that Illinois hasn't had a game since blowing a 23-point lead in an overtime loss at UCLA last Saturday. \"So while Michigan had a bit of a palate-cleanser from the Duke game with its win against Minnesota at home, I think the Illini are going to be breathing fire,\" he says.NBA best bets, where to watchCavaliers at PistonsTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Detroit | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Detroit -5.5\nTwo Eastern Conference contenders collide when the Detroit Pistons and Cleveland Cavaliers battle at Little Caesars Arena. The Pistons (43-14) lead the East by 5.5 games over the Celtics, while the Cavaliers (37-23) sit in fourth. But Cleveland is actually the +280 betting favorite at DraftKings to win the conference, ahead of Boston (+310) and Detroit (+360). On Friday, however, the Cavaliers will be without All-Star guard Donovan Mitchell, who has a right groin strain. The SportsLine Projection Model says the Pistons have a 52.0% chance to cover and gives a C grade to Detroit -5.5.Nuggets at ThunderTime: 9:30 p.m. | Location: Oklahoma City | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Nuggets +8 | Expert: Nikola Jokic Under 52.5 Points + Assists + Rebounds -121 (Matt Severance)\nWhom do you have for NBA MVP? Shai Gilgeous-Alexander or Nikola Jokic? Gilgeous-Alexander, the reigning MVP, is the -250 favorite at DraftKings, while three-time MVP Jokic is the +425 second choice. On Friday they will go head-to-head when Gilgeous-Alexander and the Oklahoma City Thunder host Jokic and the Denver Nuggets. The game will be the first since Feb. 3 for Gilgeous-Alexander, who has missed the last nine games with an abdominal strain. The SportsLine Projection Model says the Nuggets have a 51.0% chance to cover and assigns a C grade to Denver +8. Meanwhile, Severance notes that Jokic had \"just\" 31 total points, rebounds and assists in his lone game against Oklahoma City this season. \"Jokic could go 30/10/10 and we still win fairly easily,\" he says.Looking aheadCollege basketball: No. 14 Kansas at No. 2 ArizonaTime: 4 p.m. Saturday | Location: Tucson, Ariz. | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Arizona -8.5\nThe first meeting this season between these two teams was one of college basketball's games of the year. In a raucous environment at Allen Fieldhouse, the Jayhawks gave the No. 1 Wildcats their first loss of the season, 82-78. Kansas pulled the upset despite playing without presumptive No. 1 overall pick Darryn Peterson, whose mysterious absences from games this season have been well documented. He, however, has finished back-to-back games now for the Jayhawks (21-7, 11-4 in Big 12). Speaking of absences, Arizona stud freshman Koa Peat is getting closer to a return and could be back in the lineup on Saturday for the Wildcats (26-2, 13-2). The SportsLine Projection Model says there's a 55.0% chance Arizona covers and gives a C grade to Wildcats -8.5.No. 20 Arkansas at No. 7 FloridaTime: 8:30 p.m. Saturday | Location: Gainesville, Fla. | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Arkansas +9.5 | Expert: Over 166.5 (Thomas Casale)\nTwo of the top teams in the SEC collide when the Florida Gators host the Arkansas Razorbacks at the O'Connell Center. The Gators (22-6, 13-2 in SEC) lead the conference by two games over the Razorbacks (21-7, 11-4) and Alabama, and they can clinch the outright regular season title with a win and a Crimson Tide loss at Tennessee on Saturday. But Arkansas has one of the most efficient offenses in the country. Led by freshman Darius Acuff, the Razorbacks average 128.6 points per 100 possessions according to KenPom, which ranks fourth in the nation. The SportsLine Projection Model says there's a 52.0% chance Arkansas covers and assigns a C grade to Razorbacks +9.5. Meanwhile, Casale likes that Arkansas plays at a fast tempo (28th in the country). \"The Gators averaged 92 points in wins over Georgia, Vanderbilt, Alabama and Texas A&M — all teams that rank top 80 in tempo,\" he says.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Charles Bediako's latest attempt to play for Alabama was denied on Friday. The former Crimson Tide center filed an appeal to the Alabama Supreme Court on Monday, two weeks after a Tuscaloosa County circuit court judge denied Bediako's motion seeking a preliminary injunction against NCAA eligibility rules. The appeal was denied on Friday.Bediako sought an interim injunctive relief that would have allowed him to play immediately. Judge Daniel Pruet, who ruled on Bediako's initial injunction request, denied that temporary relief on Tuesday. The next step for Bediako and his representation was to make the same request to the Alabama Supreme Court in search of a different outcome via an emergency motion. It did not come to fruition, likely signaling an end to Bediako's hopes of returning to the floor for the Crimson Tide this season.Bediako has remained a student at Alabama and helped with the scout team, per coach Nate Oats. While waiting for the result of his appeal, Bediako played for Team Canada in Puerto Rico on Thursday as part of the FIBA Basketball World Cup qualifiers. Meanwhile, No. 17 Alabama will face No. 22 Tennessee on the road on Saturday as it looks to extend its winning streak to eight games.\"We understand that Charles is pursuing an appeal in his case against the NCAA, and ultimately, he must do what he considers to be in his best interest,\" the University of Alabama said in a statement. \"The University continues to support Charles as he works toward completing his degree.\"\nIt's the latest twist in what's been quite the saga for Bediako, the NCAA and eligibility rules.Bediako played for Alabama in 2021-22 and 2022-23 before forgoing the rest of his eligibility and entering the NBA Draft pool. Though he did not get drafted, he signed a two-way contract with the San Antonio Spurs. He never appeared in an NBA game but did play for the Austin Spurs of the NBA G League. He also appeared in G League games for the Grand Rapids Gold and the Motor City Cruise on Exhibit 10 contracts.\n        \n            \n                Charles Bediako ineligible after judge's ruling: Why 7-footer's journey from G League back to Alabama is over\n                \n                    Matt Norlander                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIn late January 2026, Bediako filed suit against the NCAA, requesting \"immediate preliminary and permanent injunctive relief.\" Because Bediako enrolled in Alabama in 2021, he was -- and is still -- within his five-year eligibility clock. Tuscaloosa County judge James Roberts granted Beidako a temporary restraining order against the NCAA, paving the way for him to return to the Crimson Tide. After it was later discovered Roberts is an Alabama donor; he recused himself from the case.\nUnder the order, Bediako played in five games with Alabama from Jan. 24 to Feb. 7, averaging 10 points, 4.6 rebounds and 1.4 blocks while shooting 77%.On Feb. 9, Alabama circuit court judge Daniel Pruet denied Bediako's motion seeking a preliminary injunction against NCAA eligibility rules. The aim of the preliminary injunction had been to allow Bediako to play for the rest of the season.\"Common sense won a round today,\" NCAA president Charlie Baker said in a statement. \"The court saw this for what it is: an attempt by professionals to pivot back to college and crowd out the next generation of students. College sports are for students, not for people who already walked away to go pro and now want to hit the 'undo' button at the expense of a teenager's dream.\n\"While we're glad the court upheld the rules our members actually want, one win doesn't fix the national mess of state laws. It's time for Congress to stop watching from the sidelines and help us provide some actual stability.\"Bediako's return to college basketball after signing multiple NBA contracts had caused significant consternation among NCAA higher-ups, with even SEC commissioner Greg Sankey signing an affidavit against Bediako's cause.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        With only a few days remaining in the regular season for the vast majority of conferences, bubble teams are feeling NCAA Tournament implications in every game.CBS Sports bracketologist Connor Groel considers Texas A&M \"the biggest wild card\" in the field -- which is pretty remarkable considering just two weeks ago the Aggies were 9-11 on the season, just 2-11 in the SEC and had lost six of their last seven games. But on Thursday night, Joni Taylor's squad beat Mississippi State 68-64 for its fourth win in a row, which, according to Groel, boosts them into his Next Four Out. \"Since the tournament became 64 teams, every at-large team has had at least 16 wins and been two or more games above .500,\" Groel said. The Aggies, who played a very sparse nonconference schedule so have fewer games on their resume than most of the field, are currently 13-11. However, they are ranked 40th in WAB, have some quality wins and are peaking at the right time, which will certainly help, especially \"because the committee could reward them for being the hottest bubble team entering the tournament.\"Texas A&M finishes the season against Ole Miss on Sunday, and that victory -- and/or a couple of wins in the SEC tournament -- could help the Aggies get to the Big Dance, a feat that seemed unfathomable mid February. (More on Ole Miss later in the column.)\nAs we've discussed before, the ACC is full of bubble teams. On Tuesday, Virginia was projected as a No. 10 seed by Groel. The Cavaliers fell 82-70 to North Carolina two days later, but a loss to a good team likely didn't affect them too much. That being said, their upcoming game against Virginia Tech shouldn't be taken lightly. As Groel put it, the winner of that game \"should be feeling really good about making the tourney.\" The Clemson Tigers improved their resume with a win over Duke last Sunday. They continued taking care of business in a 70-63 road win against Cal and Groel now considers them safely into the tournament, along with Princeton and Villanova. Clemson will end the regular season against the Stanford Cardinal, a team that has a lot of work to do if it wants to avoid missing the tournament for the second consecutive year.\nColorado was a Last Four In Team on Tuesday, but a loss to Utah later that day means their game at BYU on Saturday is even more important. Arizona State is in a similar position after losing to BYU. The Sun Devils have a tough task ahead as they will close their regular season with a road game against Texas Tech.While we won't get another full Bracketology update until Monday, Groel did provide us with a look at where his bubble stands as of Feb. 27, though he emphasizes that these teams are all extremely close, especially Colorado, South Dakota State and the eight teams on the outside looking in. In other words, every game truly does count right now.Last Four In: Virginia, Virginia Tech, Colorado, South Dakota StateFirst Four Out: Arizona State, Richmond, Mississippi State, StanfordNext Four Out: Kansas, BYU, Utah, Texas A&MElsewhere, the competition heating up for teams hoping for a chance to host an NCAA tournament game. Kentucky has a home game against South Carolina on Sunday, which could help the Wildcats chances at moving up to a No. 4 seed. However, the current No. 4 seeds -- Minnesota, TCU, Michigan State and Maryland -- will also be trying to hang on. \nMichigan State hosting projected No. 3 seed Ohio State on Sunday is one of the must-watch matchups for this weekend, along with Duke at North Carolina (more on that below).Here is what else is happening in women's college basketball:LSU clinches double-byeAn 89-73 win over Tennessee helped the Tigers secure one of the top four spots in the SEC standings, which will give them a free ticket to the quarterfinals of the conference tournament along with South Carolina, Vanderbilt and Texas. That was also the Tigers' 25th win this season, making Kim Mulkey the first coach in SEC history to win 25+ games in each of her first five seasons with a program.\nSo far, the Tigers have been a No. 3 seed in all NCAA Tournament appearances under Mulkey, but this year they could be looking at a No. 2 seed, and technically, a No. 1 seed is not impossible either -- although right now it's more likely the last No. 1 seed goes to Texas or Vanderbilt.\nOle Miss unlikely to hostThe Rebels were one of the early top 16 teams released by the NCAA on Feb. 14. However, a 74-67 loss to Florida on Thursday likely cost Ole Miss a chance at a No. 4 seed, which would have allowed them to host an NCAA Tournament game for the first time since 1992.\"I was just really disappointed in our presence,\" Coach Yolett McPhee-McCuin said postgame. \"I didn't feel like we showed up ready to compete. Right now this is the time of the year when teams should be desperate to win and I just didn't feel that desperation from my team. So that's something that I will have to look at and figure out how to correct.\"\nDawn Staley confirms Chloe Kitts' returnEarlier this week, South Carolina coach Dawn Staley announced that senior Chloe Kitts will return for the 2026-27 season. The 6-foot-2 forward was sidelined after she tore her ACL during a practice on September 2025.The team will also get back senior forward Ashlyn Watkins, who took a year off for personal reasons. The biggest question right now is whether or not Madina Okot will get another year of eligibility because despite being a senior, this is only her second year playing at an NCAA institution. She spent two seasons at Zetech University in Kenya before playing at Mississippi State through the 2024-25 season and then transferring to South Carolina.\"We're trying to get a year back,\" Staley said. \"Whether or not we'll be able to do that and prove that the conditions that she played in her first two years in Kenya were not comparable to NCAA standards.\"\nGame to watch this weekendNo. 12 Duke at No. 21 North Carolina -- Sunday (12 p.m. ET on ESPN)In-state rivalries are always fun, but more so when there are postseason implications on the line. Groel has Duke projected as a No. 3 seed in the NCAA Tournament, but the Tar Heels will need this one if they want a chance at jumping from a No. 5 seed to a No. 4. Duke took a 72-68 home victory on February 15, which was part of a 17-game winning streak that recently got snapped by Clemson. However, now it's the Tar Heels' turn to host. The team is fresh off an 82-70 road win against Virginia in which they registered a program record 16 3-pointers.\n            ",

There may be only one tight end to hear his name called Thursday night in April, but the group as a whole impressed Friday in Indianapolis.In total, 27 tight ends participated at this year's event, forming the fastest group ever at the annual showcase. Oregon's Kenyon Sadiq and Vanderbilt's Eli Stowers also pushed the boundaries in the vertical and broad jumps.CBS Sports grades the top tight end prospects while also highlighting other standouts.The 2026 NFL Draft will take place April 23–25 in Pittsburgh. You can find more draft coverage at CBSSports.com, including weekly mock drafts and regular evaluations of the top prospects.\nGrading top TE prospects\nMeasurables: 6-foot-3⅛, 241 pounds, 10-inch hands, 31½-inch arm length, 78¼-inch wingspanTesting: 4.39-second 40-yard dash, 1.54-second 10-yard split, 43.5-inch vertical jump, 11-foot-1 broad jumpGrade: A+ -- Kenyon Sadiq tied an NFL combine record for tight ends with a 43.5-inch vertical jump, only for Vanderbilt's Eli Stowers to shatter the mark minutes later. Sadiq also recorded an 11-foot-1 broad jump and blistered the track with a 4.39-second 40-yard dash, the latter setting an NFL combine record at the position. Since 2003, only three players -- Nick Emmanwori, DK Metcalf and Sadiq -- have run sub-4.4 seconds in the 40-yard dash, posted a 40-plus-inch vertical and recorded an 11-plus-foot broad jump at 220-plus pounds, per NFL Research. Sadiq is the heaviest player to accomplish the feat.It would have been ideal if he were a little bigger, but it was an overall impressive display of athletic potential. Sadiq has cemented his case to be the first tight end off the board and likely a top-half first-round pick.\nMeasurables: 6-foot-3¾, 239 pounds, 9⅝-inch hands, 32⅝-inch arm length, 79¾-inch wingspanTesting: 4.51-second 40-yard dash, 1.59-second 10-yard split, 45.5-inch vertical jump, 11-foot-3 broad jumpGrade: A -- Eli Stowers set the NFL combine record for a tight end in the vertical jump (45.5 inches). He also posted an 11-foot-3 broad jump and ran the 40-yard dash in 4.51 seconds. Although a bit on the lighter side, no one -- except for Sadiq — did a better job showcasing their athletic potential. Stowers all but guaranteed he will hear his name called on Day 2 of the NFL Draft.\nMeasurables: 6-foot-4⅜, 246 pounds, 9⅛-inch hands, 32⅛-inch arm length, 77⅞-inch wingspanTesting: Did not participate in on-field testingGrade: B -- Max Klare did not run or participate in athletic testing but took part in drills. In the gauntlet, in particular, Klare did a solid job snatching the ball away from his body while barely drifting down the line. It was not an overwhelming day for the potential TE2, but he also did not hurt his stock. Ohio State's pro day will be important for his testing.\nMeasurables: 6-foot-5, 245 pounds, 9½-inch hands, 31⅝-inch arm lengthTesting: Did not participate in on-field testingGrade: N/A -- During a routine X-ray, Oscar Delp learned he had played the entire season with a hairline fracture in his foot and would not be able to participate in the combine. It was a disappointing development for a player who had prepared to make a strong statement in Indianapolis.\nMeasurables: 6-foot-4⅝, 245 pounds, 9⅝-inch hands, 31⅛-inch arm lengthTesting: 4.62-second 40-yard dash, 1.59-second 10-yard split, 36-inch vertical jump, 9-foot-11 broad jumpGrade: B+ -- Blocking is not Jack Endries' forte, but he did a nice job in that drill. He also hugged the line well in the gauntlet drill and displayed reliable hands.\nOther standoutsJohn Michael Gyllenborg, WyomingMeasurables: 6-foot-5¾, 249 pounds, 10-inch hands, 31-inch arm lengthTesting: 4.60-second 40-yard dash, 1.60-second 10-yard split, 35.5-inch vertical jump, 10-foot-8 broad jumpGyllenborg ran the 40-yard dash in 4.60 seconds, which is more than respectable for a tight end of his size. He held his own in the sled-blocking drills and was excellent in the gauntlet drill, including making a mid-run adjustment on his second rep.\nMatthew Hibner, SMUMeasurables: 6-foot-4¼, 251 pounds, 9⅜-inch hands, 32⅜-inch arm lengthTesting: 4.57-second 40-yard dash, 1.61-second 10-yard split, 37-inch vertical jump, 9-foot-8 broad jumpHibner had been buried behind several talented tight ends at Michigan but has shown more of his pass-catching ability at SMU. He posted an impressive 37-inch vertical jump and ran the 40-yard dash in 4.57 seconds.\nNate Boerkircher, Texas A&MMeasurables: 6-foot-5½, 245 pounds, 10½-inch hands, 32⅝-inch arm lengthTesting: Did not participate in on-field testingBoerkircher entered the event known primarily as a blocking tight end, a role that has gained increased value in today's NFL through the success of players like Jackson Hawes and others. He did a nice job in the gauntlet drill, drifting slightly but showcasing strong hands while maintaining speed.\n            \n\n\n        \n                        ",

He previously spent multiple seasons as an assistant at Michigan. The sexual assault allegations stem from his time with the Wolverines, and the Ann Arbor Police Department confirmed to ESPN that it is investigating the claims against Lewis. After a college career at Tennessee, Lewis went undrafted in 2017 before having brief stints with the then-Oakland Raiders, Houston Texans and Tennessee Titans. His playing career ended following one season with the XFL's Houston Roughnecks in 2020. \nLewis broke into coaching at Akron in 2020 as a graduate assistant. He then spent one season at South Alabama and another at Wake Forest before joining then-Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh's staff at Michigan ahead of the 2023 season.\n            \n",

    "body": "\n        Off-the-wall questioning is fairly common during the evaluation process leading up to the NFL Draft. Sometimes, head coaches and front office members throw random questions at players during interviews simply to see how they react when things go off-kilter.In Fernando Mendoza's case, the most bizarre moment he's encountered so far during draft interviews wasn't a question at all. Instead, it was a request that he find himself in handcuffs. Literally.\"I don't know if I can say this,\" a smirking Mendoza said when CBS Sports' Aditi Kinkhabwala asked about the strangest questions he's received. \"It was, 'Hey, maybe you should get arrested.'\"Mendoza clarified that the team suggesting he get arrested did so in hopes it would impact his draft stock enough for him to slide out of being the No. 1 overall pick, which he is widely expected to be. He also quickly noted the club was not one of the teams he had a formal interview with.\"Hopefully, I don't get arrested,\" he chuckled.\nOf course, this was a tongue-in-cheek remark from a team wishing it were in position to select Mendoza. That's especially true with this year's draft class lacking high-end quarterback talent, while the free agent and trade markets also don't feature clear-cut cornerstone options.The Indiana signal-caller is the presumptive No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, which means he's currently projected to land in Las Vegas with the Raiders. During his press conference Friday, he gave a rave review of his formal interview with the organization.\"It was a fantastic interview,\" Mendoza said, via NFL.com. \"Coaching staff was in there. We went over some of my previous plays and did plays on the board. I thought it was a great meeting. I know they have the No. 1 pick, but anything can happen in the draft. Excited for the opportunity and whatever team drafts me, I am going to give everything I got to them.\"He also added that he'd be thrilled wherever he ends up, \"whether it's the No. 1 pick or whether it's, you know, the 199th pick.\" That was a not-so-subtle nod to his likely soon-to-be boss, Raiders minority owner Tom Brady, who was famously the 199th pick in the 2000 NFL Draft by the New England Patriots.\n\n        \n            \n                Fernando Mendoza explains what he wants to learn most from Tom Brady if he's drafted No. 1 by the Raiders\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMendoza is coming off a historic 2025 season for the Hoosiers, leading the program to a 16-0 record, a Heisman Trophy and a win over Miami in the CFP National Championship. He completed 72% of his passes for 3,535 yards, 41 touchdowns and just six interceptions while also adding 276 yards and seven touchdowns on the ground.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The last day of February is packed to the brim with NCAA Tournament bubble intrigue as college basketball's regular season nears its end. Conference tournament action is set to begin in the coming days for a handful of mid-major conferences, and the high-major schools are running short on resume-padding opportunities.Against that backdrop, Saturday is pivotal. It starts with Seton Hall trying to salvage its at-large hopes at UConn and end with Saint Mary's aiming for a final bit of at-large insurance in the late-night window against Gonzaga. In between, there are myriad consequential games that will shape the picture heading into March.Among them are a couple of \"double bubble\" battles, including a showdown between New Mexico and San Diego State on CBS. The Mountain West's bid tally is up in the air, and the results of that one will influence the conference's overall outlook as we creep closer to Selection Sunday.Later on, Texas and Texas A&M square off in a rivalry showdown that carries even greater stakes than usual. With both programs on the bubble under first-year coaches, intensity will be high as the Longhorns look to even the season series with a road win.\nHere is the full rundown of the bubble picture entering Saturday's action.Last Four InCalSanta Clara TCUTexas A&MFirst Four OutNew MexicoOhio State Seton HallVCUNext Four OutIndianaStanfordUSCVirginia TechCheck out the CBS Sports Bracketology model's latest bracket at the Bracketology hub                                All times ET                 Bubble teams in action Saturday\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Seton Hallat UConn | 12 p.m. (FS1)Entering the weekend: First Four OutGame status: Quad 1Seton Hall has a lot of ground to make up, but beating UConn on the road would cover a nice chunk of it. This would be one of the 10 best victories posted by anyone in college basketball this season, and it would prove to the selection committee that the Pirates are worthy of a hard look. But if Seton Hall can't pull a mammoth upset, this will likely be the end of the road for the Pirates' at-large aspirations.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    VCUvs. Fordham | 12:30 p.m. (USA)Entering the weekend: First Four OutGame status: Quad 4The Rams are an interesting case study because the average of their resume metrics is hovering in the mid-40s. Generally speaking, that's fringe at-large territory. But there isn't a single victory a projected at-large team, and VCU is just 4-7 across the top two quadrants. Playing Fordham is a nothing-burger, but it gives VCU a chance to reset the vibes after more than a week off since a disappointing loss to Saint Louis. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Missouriat Mississippi State | 1 p.m. (SEC Network)Entering the weekend: No. 9 seedGame status: Quad 2\nMissouri is the perfect example of why you should like at WAB instead of NET. If all you saw was Missouri's No. 58 NET ranking, you might think the Tigers have no business in the at-large conversation. But with a highly respectable No. 35 WAB ranking, Mizzou is actually in decent shape. Coming off a win over Tennessee -- its fifth Quad 1 win -- Missouri would have to fall hard down the stretch to miss the dance. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Clemsonvs. Louisville | 2 p.m. (ESPN2)Entering the weekend: No. 9 seedGame status: Quad 1Four straight losses have dropped Clemson from the ACC title race into the bubble conversation. At 10-7 across Quads 1 and 2, the Tigers are still OK for now. But facing Louisville and North Carolina (Tuesday on the road) isn't the easiest way to get back on track. Clemson likely needs to win two of its final three games to feel good entering the ACC Tournament.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New Mexicovs. San Diego State | 2 p.m. (CBS)Entering the weekend: First Four OutGame status: Quad 2New Mexico dropped onto the wrong side of the bubble following a 67-60 Quad 1 loss at Nevada on Tuesday. The Lobos are hovering around 50th in results-based metrics. They will likely need to be in the mid-40s come Selection Sunday to have a realistic chance at inclusion. Any way you slice it, closing the regular season with a win at Utah State would be huge. But evening the season series with San Diego State would keep the Lobos in position along the cut line.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    San Diego Stateat New Mexico | 2 p.m. (CBS)Entering the weekend: No. 11 seed (auto-bid)Game status: Quad 1\nThe Mountain West could get anywhere from 1 to 3 bids, depending on how things play out for San Diego State and New Mexico. The Aztecs are currently \"in\" the CBS Sports Bracketology field as the league's automatic bid recipient. But, from an at-large perspective, they are just 53rd in WAB and have work to do. This game is critical because it's the best game the Aztecs have left in the regular season.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    UCLAat Minnesota | 2 p.m. (FS1)Entering the weekend: No. 9 seedGame status: Quad 1Coming off a blowout loss at Michigan State on Feb. 17, the Bruins had dropped three of five games and two straight by a combined margin of 53 points. Things appeared to be going south in a hurry. But consecutive victories over Illinois and USC have restored UCLA's tournament trajectory. If the Bruins win two of three down the stretch, they will likely head to the Big Ten Tournament in a strong position.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Georgiavs. South Carolina | 3:30 p.m. (SEC Network)Entering the weekend: No. 10 seedGame status: Quad 3\nGeorgia is in good shape, but a loss here would change that. Falling at home to a bad South Carolina team would bring an estimated WAB hit of roughly 0.80, which would translate to a 5-7 spot drop in WAB ranking. That would put Georgia in the low-to-mid 40s, which is close to the likely cut line. But if the Bulldogs take care of business against a team they should beat, they'll head into the final week of the regular season on solid footing.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    USCvs. Nebraska | 4 p.m. (Big Ten Network)Entering the weekend: Next Four OutGame status: Quad 1It might feel like USC is a lost cause amid a four-game losing streak. But the Trojans have consecutive Quad 1 opportunities ahead, starting Saturday against Nebraska. If they close on a three-game winning streak -- or win 2 of 3 and get some favorable results from other bubble teams -- they could still head to the Big Ten Tournament with some at-large pulse. Pulling that off is going to require some rapid improvement, though, because this team is flunking the eye test.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Californiavs. Pitt | 4 p.m. (ACC Network)Entering the weekend: Last Four InGame status: Quad 3Playing lowly Pitt at home is nothing but a landmine for Cal. It's a no-reward, high-risk proposition, and the Bears better be ready. With wins over four projected tournament teams (UCLA, North Carolina, Miami and SMU), Cal is looking good from a resume perspective. That would change quickly if the Bears slip up against the Panthers.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Texasat Texas A&M | 4 p.m. (ESPN2)Entering the weekend: No. 10 seedGame status: Quad 1\nTexas had Florida on the ropes until the final seven minutes on Wednesday. That's when the Gators mashed the gas pedal, showing their elite gear and leaving the Longhorns in the dust. Missing out on a potential resume-defining win was a bummer. Still, Texas should have no problem flushing that and getting up for Texas A&M. After losing its first meeting with the Aggies at home back on Jan. 17, Texas will be out for revenge in a high-intensity \"double bubble\" battle.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Texas A&Mvs. Texas | 4 p.m. (ESPN2)Entering the weekend: Last Four InGame status: Quad 2Seeing Bucky McMillan's high-octane system back in the NCAA Tournament would be entertaining. Remember, his Samford team took Kansas down to the wire during a 2024 first-round game. Now in his first season with the Aggies, McMillan has more talent. But he still needs a couple more wins to feel safe after A&M struggled through a four-game losing skid to open February. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    TCUat Kansas State | 6:30 p.m. (ESPN2)Entering the weekend: Last Four InGame status: Quad 2TCU has won five of its past six games to reach 18-10 (8-7 Big 12) heading into the weekend. The Horned Frogs own a resume that is all over the map. It includes wins over Florida, Wisconsin and Iowa State but losses to Notre Dame, Utah and Colorado. The demonstrated ability to beat high-caliber opposition bodes well for Jamie Dixon's club in the selection discussion, but the Horned Frogs need to win two of three down the stretch.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Santa Claravs. Oregon State | 8 p.m. (CBS Sports Network)Entering the weekend: Last Four InGame status: Quad 4Santa Clara lost at home to Gonzaga on Feb. 14 and fell at Saint Mary's on Wednesday. The Gaels needed to win one of those two games to feel safe-ish. Now they have to take care of business against Oregon State and then gear up for a potentially tense WCC Tournament. Beating the Zags or Gaels on a neutral floor would be significant for a Santa Clara team that is 1-5 in Quad 1.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Auburnvs. Ole Miss | 8:30 p.m. (SEC Network)Entering the weekend: No. 10 seedGame status: Quad 3Generally speaking, a Quad 3 game this time of year is nothing but a needless risk for a team on the bubble. But in Auburn's case, hosting Ole Miss could be viewed as a welcome reprieve. After a stretch of six losses in seven games, Auburn just needs wins. Ole Miss is limping in on a 10-game losing streak, which should allow the Tigers to regain their footing.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Virginia Techat North Carolina | 8:30 p.m. (ESPN2)Entering the weekend: Next Four OutGame status: Quad 1Virginia Tech fans who have seen their team drop four of its past six games might wonder why the Hokies are still showing up in a bubble watch. But beating North Carolina on the road would send Virginia Tech surging back toward the cut line, as it would bring a projected 5-8 spot rise in WAB ranking for the Hokies. A season-ending road game at Virginia is also a big opportunity. It'll take a big upset or two, but the Hokies aren't dead yet.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Saint Mary'svs. Gonzaga | 10:30 p.m. (ESPN)Entering the weekend: No. 10 seedGame status: Quad 1Saint Mary's averages out as a top-30 team across both results-based and predictive metrics looked at by the selection committee. But while the Gaels are 8-1 in Quad 2, they remain winless in Quad 1. Wednesday night's 86-67 home win over Santa Clara was the best win of the season for the Gaels, which is a little concerning. Toppling Gonzaga one last time before the Bulldogs leave for the Pac-12 would make for some great insurance. Bubble teams in action Sunday\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Ohio Statevs. No. 8 Purdue | 1:30 p.m. (CBS)Entering the weekend: First Four OutGame status: Quad 1Ohio State got second-leading scorer John Mobley Jr. back from a three-game injury absence, but the Buckeyes looked flat anyway during a 74-57 loss at Iowa on Wednesday.

It is a rematch of an early-season thriller won by San Diego State, 83-79, behind a game-high 21 points from forward Miles Byrd.Despite losing two of its past three games, San Diego State enters the final stretch of the regular season tied atop the Mountain West standings. The Aztecs are coming off an 89-72 win over MWC co-leader Utah State earlier this week. San Diego State is seeking its fourth regular-season title in the past nine seasons.New Mexico is coming off a loss to Nevada and sits one game behind San Diego State and Utah State in the conference race.

New Mexico is 9-6 against Quad 1 and Quad 2 opponents this season, compared with 7-7 for San Diego State.San Diego State's offense surging: San Diego State is averaging 79.3 points per game — its highest mark since the 1984-85 season. That ranks No. 104 nationally.

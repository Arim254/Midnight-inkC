    "body": "\n        Teams on opposite sides of the AFC North standings meet in the nightcap of the 2025 NFL Thanksgiving schedule when the Baltimore Ravens host the Cincinnati Bengals. The Ravens are tied atop the division with the Steelers, and currently hold the tiebreaker. Cincinnati, meanwhile, is tied with the Browns at the bottom of the division, but the Bengals will have receiver Ja'Marr Chase back from suspension and expect to have quarterback Joe Burrow (toe) back in the lineup. Kickoff is at 8:20 p.m. ET from Baltimore. Baltimore is a 7-point favorite in the Bengals vs. Ravens odds, while the over/under is 51.5. Before making any Ravens vs. Bengals picks, be sure to see what the SportsLine projection model has to say. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets instantly if your bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

Jackson (toe) missed practice on Monday, but was a full participant on Tuesday. They're 3-2 against the spread during that five-game span, but just missed two covers that would've put them on a 5-0 ATS run. Jackson's improved health has certainly been a factor in the run, but the defense is also playing much better. Since an embarrassing 44-10 loss to the Texans on Oct. 5, no team has cleared 20 points against Baltimore. The Bengals are getting healthier, but aren't expected to have Tee Higgins (concussion) for this one. Burrow being sharp after such a long layoff isn't a foregone conclusions either, so Baltimore has a clear path to a win and cover. See which team to back at SportsLine.New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states:Why the Bengals can coverLikely having Burrow back under center certainly makes this a much more competitive matchup. Cincinnati didn't blink against the powerful Patriots in Week 12 either, losing 26-20 and staying within the 7.5-point spread. Now the Bengals get their two-time Pro Bowl quarterback under center, along with Chase back in the lineup following last week's suspension. Baltimore's offense scored just 23 points in each of the past two weeks against two of the league's worst teams -- the Browns and Jets -- giving Cincinnati a chance to keep this game competitive and within the number. See which team to back at SportsLine. Check out the latest BetMGM promo code CBSSPORTS, where new users can get up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses.How to make Ravens vs. Bengals picksFor Bengals vs. Ravens on Thanksgiving, the model is leaning Over the total, projecting 54 combined points.

Now, in Week 13, those hopes are set to be realized, with the star quarterback expected to make his anticipated return against the rival Baltimore Ravens.In theory, Burrow's return couldn't come at a more perfect time. The Bengals are undeniably desperate, looking to avoid their fifth straight loss after dropping eight of nine contests since Burrow's exit, and yet the AFC North race is far from over. The Ravens are technically on top at 6-5, but their own signal-caller, Lamar Jackson, hardly looks himself. And the division's second-place squad, the Pittsburgh Steelers, are no firmer thanks to a streaky defense and banged-up Aaron Rodgers.Yet if the Bengals couldn't even win while Burrow's emergency fill-in, Joe Flacco, enjoyed big-play production earlier this year, should we really expect a different outcome for Cincinnati on Thursday night? Either way, the third and final matchup of this year's 2025 Thanksgiving slate is must-see material.Bet Ravens vs. Bengals at Bet365 Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets using the bonus code CBSBET365:Here's everything you need to know to catch Bengals-Ravens on Turkey Day, including key matchups and our prediction:\nWhere to watch Ravens vs. Bengals liveDate: Thursday, Nov. 27 | Time: 8:20 p.m. ETLocation: M&T Bank Stadium (Baltimore)TV: NBC | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Ravens -7, O/U 51.5 (via DraftKings Sportsbook)Key questions\n                                                                    Imagn Images\n                                                            How ready is Joe Burrow, really? Coach Zac Taylor insists his quarterback is \"in good shape\" after a nine-game absence. It helps Burrow also got some practice reps in ahead of the Bengals' last game. Still, the Pro Bowler is returning earlier than initially expected from a severe turf toe injury, and we just saw in San Francisco, with Brock Purdy, what can happen when recovery timelines are rushed. Up against an improved Ravens defense on a short week, this profiles as a tall task for No. 9.Can the Bengals slow Derrick Henry? The Ravens' star running back has been much more erratic this year than last, but he's helped carry Baltimore's grind-it-out attack since Lamar Jackson's return from injury, including with three touchdowns over the last two weeks. After mustering just 3 yards per carry against the New York Jets, this could be just the matchup for him to find daylight, as the Bengals are surrendering 156 rushing yards per game, which is ranked 31st in the entire NFL.Can Ja'Marr Chase single-handedly outrace Baltimore's secondary? The Ravens were surprisingly docile on defense to open the year, but they've tightened up since mid-October, allowing 17 or more points just once during their five-game win streak. Chase is arguably the NFL's top playmaker out wide, especially when Burrow is feeding him downfield opportunities, but he's coming off a one-game suspension and will be without top running mate Tee Higgins, who's sidelined with a concussion.You can bet Ravens vs. Bengals at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:X factor to watch\nOnce a ball-hawking member of the Ravens' secondary, Stone is coming off his splashiest outing of the 2025 campaign in Cincinnati, logging a pick six against Drake Maye and the New England Patriots to help the Bengals flirt with an upset. Practicing against Lamar Jackson and Co. for his first four NFL seasons might give Stone at least some advantage going into this matchup. But Jackson's recent inefficiencies as a passer might be the best thing working in Stone's favor; let's say Lamar gets a little too impatient while seeking the big play for Baltimore, giving his old friend a chance to steal a possession for the Bengals.Prediction\nIt's true that even when Flacco was dealing as Burrow's replacement, the Bengals failed miserably in other facets, be it situational coaching or general defensive competence. But there might be something to the notion that Burrow's return will put a little extra pep in everyone's step. The Ravens' own scattershot offense is another reason to believe this could be a pristine night for Burrow and Chase to reestablish their home run connection and throw another wrench into an already messy AFC North tangle.That said, we hesitate to put too much trust into a Zac Taylor-led operation that's routinely struggled to look prepared, and Higgins' absence should allow Baltimore to really hone in on lessening Chase's impact. There's also the distinct possibility of Jackson rediscovering his own juice as a rusher, with the bruising Henry by his side, against such a porous run \"D\" in Cincy. We anticipate some holiday fireworks before the buzzer, but give us the home team to scrape one out on Thanksgiving night.\nPick: Ravens 26, Bengals 22 | Bengals +7, Under 51.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

Dallas (5-5-1) is coming off 24-21 comeback victory over Philadelphia on Sunday, and the Cowboys are 34-22-1 all-time on Thanksgiving. Kansas City (6-5) toppled Indianapolis, 23-20, in Week 12 and will be part of the NFL Thanksgiving tradition for the first time since 2006, going 5-5 all-time on Turkey Day.

Kareem Hunt ran for over 100 yards versus what was the No. 5 run defense, while Indy's Jonathan Taylor -- who leads the NFL in both rushing yards and touchdowns -- was held to just 58 yards on the ground and kept out of the endzone.

Additionally, the Cowboys have won three straight Thanksgiving Day games, with a 16.7-point average margin of victory in them. Despite Andy Reid, Mahomes and Kelce being on the other sideline, it's the Cowboys who will have the best offense on the field as they rank first in yards and fourth in scoring. Additionally, the Cowboys should be able to take advantage of a team which has gotten a little sloppy as of late as the Chiefs have as many turnovers (six) over their last four games as they had over their previous 18 regular season games. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Cowboys vs. Chiefs picksFor the NFL Week 13 game of Chiefs vs. Cowboys, the model is leaning Under the total.

    "body": "\n        There's no better time to make college football picks than during Rivalry Week, which is loaded with fierce foes squaring off.

Not only can you make picks on those conference matchups, but a number of non-conference contests could factor into your college football betting strategy. South Carolina is a 2.5-point favorite over Clemson, per the latest Week 14 college football odds, in an SEC vs. ACC battle.Others of that ilk include Florida vs. Florida State (+1.5) and Kentucky vs. Louisville (-3). Meanwhile, no team has performed better in college football picks against the spread than Texas Tech, which is 10-1 versus the line. The Red Raiders are 23.5-point favorites over West Virginia as the former seeks a win to secure its first-ever trip to the Big 12 Championship Game.

The Gators have been much more competitive since firing Billy Napier as the team has as many ATS wins (two) in four games under interim Billy Gonzales as it had in seven games under Napier. Florida won last year's matchup -- by 20 points on the road -- and it hosting this year's contest gives it a massive advantage. The Seminoles have not won or covered in an away stadium since 2023 as they are 0-8 both straight-up and against the spread over that run. In addition to Florida covering, the model forecasts the Under to hit in well over 60% of simulations. See which other picks the model likes here.\nAnother prediction: Virginia Tech (+9.5, 52.5) covers on the road versus No. 17 Virginia at 7 p.m. ET on Saturday. It's impossible to ignore the outright dominance of the Hokies over their in-state rival in this series, as Virginia Tech has won 19 of its last 20 games versus Virginia Tech. The last few matchups haven't even been close, as Virginia Tech won by 20 points at home last year and prevailed by 38 points the last time UVA hosted in 2023. This year, the Hokies have played much better under interim coach, Philip Montgomery, as they've both outright won and covered three times under him, compared to being winless both straight up and ATS under former coach Brent Fry. UVA has dropped two straight at home ATS as the model forecasts this as a one-score game. The model projects the Hokies to cover nearly 60% of the time. See the rest of the model's picks here.\nHow to make college football picks for Week 14The model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every FBS matchup in Week 14, and it's identified several A-rated picks involving major games. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine, and for a limited time you can use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1.So what college football picks can you make with confidence, and which A-rated picks should you jump on?

But teams were still wheeling and dealing as of Tuesday afternoon, with the Boston Red Sox and St. Louis Cardinals agreeing to a swap involving veteran starter Sonny Gray. (You can read our full analysis of that deal here.) Might other teams get some business done before turning their attention to turkey? Keep it here to find out, as CBS Sports will be logging all of Wednesday's most notable moves and murmurs in the space below.Marlins likely to reengage in extension talks with PérezEury Pérez is one of the most talented young pitchers in the majors. Unsurprisingly, the Marlins have interest in locking in his services for the long haul. The Marlins are expected to reengage Pérez on extension talks at some point this offseason, according to MLB.com.\nMiami had previously tried to extend Pérez last spring, though obviously those talks did not culminate in an agreement.Pérez, 22, will not become arbitration eligible until next winter. In 39 career big-league starts, he's amassed a 3.71 ERA (123 ERA+) and a 3.38 strikeout-to-walk ratio. Those contributions have been worth an estimated 3.9 Wins Above Replacement, per the calculations housed at Baseball Reference.\nThe Marlins are also reportedly interested in extending breakout outfielder Kyle Stowers.Rays bring back FraleyElsewhere in the state of Florida, the Rays have reached an agreement with free-agent outfielder Jake Fraley that will see him reportedly earn $3 million next season. Fraley had previously been non-tendered by the Rays, who obtained him off waivers back in early November.\nFraley, 30, was originally drafted by Tampa Bay out of college. He was traded before he ever reached the majors, however, meaning his next big-league game with the Rays will be his first. Across parts of seven seasons, he's hit .248/.333/.402 (100 OPS+) with per-162 game averages of 16 home runs and 21 stolen bases. Fraley played 76 games for the Reds and Braves in 2025.\n            \n    ",

The Lions remain one game back of the Bears (yes, really) for first place in the NFC North, and they'll also have revenge on their minds for this game, as the Packers destroyed them back in Week 1. The game is part of a tough three-week stretch for the Lions, who play the Cowboys and Rams in the two games following this one.Green Bay also captured a win last week, improving to 7-3-1 with a comfortable victory over the Vikings. Green Bay has won back-to-back games since being somewhat embarrassed in games against the Panthers and Eagles a few weeks ago, and will surely be looking to lay the hammer down on the Lions here and knock them even further back in the division race. The Packers have their own chance to stake claim to the division down the stretch, with games against Detroit and Minnesota and two against Chicago.Will the Packers make it three wins in a row, or will the Lions finally stack back-to-back victories for the first time since early October? We'll find out soon enough.

The Packers absolutely destroyed the Lions back in Week 1. Their defensive front totally dominated the game to the point that the Lions were essentially unable to function offensively. Micah Parsons played a limited role after sitting out for most of the offseason program prior to his trade to Green Bay, but he was phenomenal in his limited snaps. Players like Lukas Van Ness, Devonte Wyatt and more showed out, and the secondary was extremely sticky in coverage throughout the game. The Lions will surely want to prove that the game was an aberration, and they have shown throughout this season that they can still be as explosive as any team in the league when they are on their game.NFC North standings. Chicago has surged into first place in the division on the strength of a four-game winning streak, but both Green Bay and Detroit are right behind the Bears. Chicago sits at 8-3, but the Packers are 7-3-1 and the Lions are 7-4. The Packers currently own the tiebreaker over the Lions thanks to their head-to-head victory, but Detroit can even that up with a win. The Lions also own the head-to-head tiebreaker with the Bears, and don't play them again until the final week of the season. The Packers have yet to play against Chicago, and have two games coming up against the Bears in Weeks 14 and 16. This round robin of games will go a long way toward determining the NFC North champion.Injuries galore. Both teams are incredibly banged up coming into this game, with a spate of injuries affecting each team. Both teams will be without their star tight end, as Tucker Kraft and Sam LaPorta remain on injured reserve. And then on Monday's injury report, an incredible 31 players were listed. That includes Packers No. 1 cornerback Keisean Nixon, pass-rusher Lukas Van Ness and interior defensive lineman Karl Brooks, along with Lions center Graham Glasgow and safety Kerby Joseph, none of whom practiced in any capacity. (Joseph is not expected to play, per Dan Campbell.) The Packers could get back one or both of Josh Jacobs and Jayden Reed, who each got in limited sessions on Monday, as did Matthew Golden. Marcus Davenport, meanwhile, could return for Detroit, but the Lions limited a whole bunch of other players (including most of their offensive line, along with Brian Branch and Terrion Arnold) on Monday as well. Thanksgiving history. This will be the 23rd all-time meeting between the Lions and Packers on Thanksgiving, the most such matchups in NFL history. (They played every year from 1951 through 1963.) The Lions are 12-9-1 in the Thanksgiving day series against Green Bay despite being just 38-45-2 all time. This will be Green Bay's 39th time playing on Thanksgiving overall, and the Packers are 16-20-2 in those contests. The last time these two teams played on Thanksgiving was actually two years ago, with the Packers winning 29-22.Prediction\nDetroit is a different team on the fast track at Ford Field than it is outdoors. That game back in Week 1 was a long time ago, and it was played at Lambeau Field. The Lions simply have more explosive playmakers on offense than do the Packers, and I therefore trust them to put up more points -- even against this Green Bay defense. \nPrediction: Lions 27, Packers 20\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\nIt's a top-of-the-table clash in the Champions League as Bayern Munich and Arsenal meet on Wednesday at the Emirates Stadium. Along with Inter Milan, the duo are the only other teams with four wins from their first four games as they're establishing themselves as two of the biggest contenders for the Champions League crown. Defending has led the way with Arsenal not allowing a goal in the Champions League while Bayern have only allowed three goals, but this is a match where that could change for both of them.How to watch Arsenal vs. Bayern Munich, oddsDate: Wednesday, Nov. 26 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Emirates Stadium -- LondonLive stream: Paramount+Odds: Arsenal +125; Draw +250; Bayern Munich +225Harry Kane has five goals in UCL play for the German giants as he has been in strong form to start the season, and he'll face a team that he's quite familiar with in the Gunners. Kane has faced Arsenal 21 times in all competitions, scoring 15 goals and netting two assists during his time with Tottenham Hotspur, but this will be his first time facing them as a member of Bayern Munich. With Bayern, he does have a strong supporting cast, but to get the first UCL goal past Arsenal will be a task.With Gabriel still missing with an injury, former Bayer Leverkusen man Piero Hincapie could get a second consecutive start at center back, which would provide help with scouting Bayern due to his Bundesliga familiarity. But there's also the question of how much each team will actually throw at this match. Both will likely make the top eight of the league phase table, and they'll want to keep their players healthy. Both are also opening sizable leads atop their respective domestic leagues, making this an even weirder match.  They also have an extensive history in the competitions with Bayern facing Arsenal five times during the league phase/group stage of this competition. Bayerm have had the upper hand in those meetings, losing only one.Arsenal are unbeaten in their last 15 matches in all competitions, while Bayern are unbeaten in 18 matches to open the season. They have drawn one, but the similarities are strong. Mikel Arteta and Vincent Kompany have been very pragmatic managers, and while they'll want to win, this is an odd situation where a draw suits both of them, so if neither team makes a major mistake, that's just how this could shake out. Matchday 5 Wednesday TV scheduleAll times U.S./EasternWEDNESDAY, NOV. 26TIMEHOW TO WATCHChampions League Matchday12 p.m.CBS Sports Golazo NetworkPafos vs. Monaco12:45 p.m.Paramount+, CBS Sports Golazo NetworkCopenhagen vs. Kairat12:45 p.m.Paramount+UEFA Champions League Today pre-match2 p.m.Paramount+Champions League Matchday2:45 p.m.CBS Sports Golazo NetworkThe Golazo Show3 p.m.Paramount+Olympiacos vs. Real Madrid3 p.m.Paramount+Sporting Lisbon vs. Club Brugge3 p.m.Paramount+, CBS Sports Golazo NetworkEintracht Frankfurt vs. Atalanta3 p.m.Paramount+Liverpool vs. PSV3 p.m.Paramount+Atletico Madrid vs. Inter3 p.m.Paramount+Arsenal vs. Bayern Munich3 p.m.Paramount+Paris Saint-Germain vs. Tottenham Hotspur3 p.m.Paramount+UEFA Champions League Today post-match5 p.m.Paramount+, CBS Sports Golazo NetworkThe Champions Club6 p.m.CBS Sports Golazo Network, YouTubeScoreline7 p.m.CBS Sports Golazo Network\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NFL's 2025 playoff picture is beginning to take hold.In the NFC, there are clear-cut teams that are out of the hunt -- the New York Giants (2-10) became the first team to be officially eliminated from playoff contention -- but there's also a jam packed upper level of the conference that could see its pecking order change -- like a shaken-up snow globe -- on a weekly basis. The NFC West has a 9-2 squad and an 8-3 squad at the top of its standings -- the Los Angeles Rams and the Seattle Seahawks -- while the top three teams in the NFC North -- the Chicago Bears (8-3), the Green Bay Packers (7-3-1) and the Detroit Lions (7-4) -- are all separated by only half a game.Seven teams will represent the NFC in the postseason, with the final three spots going to wild cards. Which franchises will emerge from the pileup to seize the opportunity to play football into mid-January? Which hopefuls are too far gone to catch up 12 weeks into the season? Here is a ranking of the seven teams considered to be still alive in the wild card chase, plus all of those teams' projected end-of-season records.Division leadersLos Angeles Rams (9-2, NFC West)Philadelphia Eagles (8-3, NFC East)Chicago Bears (8-3, NFC North)Tampa Bay Buccaneers (6-5, NFC South)Unofficially out of itNew Orleans Saints (2-9)Washington Commanders (3-8)Arizona Cardinals (3-8)Atlanta Falcons (4-7)Minnesota Vikings (4-7)Officially eliminated from playoff contentionNew York Giants (2-9)All odds via FanDuel Sportsbook.

How does that happen? Carolina's offense was stuck in quicksand, totaling just 230 total yards and going just 1-for-7 on third down. \nQuarterback Bryce Young ranks bottom 10 among qualified quarterbacks in yards/attempt (6.2, 27th), touchdown to interception ratio (1.7, 26th)  and passer rating (83.8) entering Week 13. Running back Rico Dowdle, whose 871 yards rushing rank as tied for the sixth most in the NFL along with Derrick Henry despite not starting until Week 5, has been excellent.The bad news is the Panthers now have the seventh hardest remaining strength of schedule in the NFL (.564 opponents' combined win percentage). They have to play both the 9-2 Rams and the 8-3 Seahawks and the NFC South-leading 6-5 Buccaneers twice. Unless Young can level up out of nowhere, Carolina will be watching the postseason from Cancún once again. Projected final record: 7-10\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Dallas Cowboys (5-5-1)Odds to win NFC East: +3300Odds to make playoffs: +520CBS' SportsLine model's playoff percentage: 11.4%The Cowboys offense is en fuego. Quarterback Dak Prescott (2,941 yards passing, third-best in the NFL), running back Javonte Williams (896 yards rushing, fifth-best in the NFL) and wide receiver George Pickens (1,054 yards receiving, second-best in the NFL) are all producing like top five players at their respective positions for the NFL's No. 4 scoring offense (29.1 points per game). Dallas is actually the only team in the league this season to have a player in the top five of the NFL in passing, rushing and receiving. \nDallas' defense for the season entering Week 13 has been just as rough overall this season, allowing 285 points per game, the second most in the NFL.The optimistic view for Dallas is it has games remaining against the 3-8 Commanders and the 2-9 Giants in addition to the rudderless Minnesota Vikings. The pessimistic view is the Cowboys also face a playoff team in the Chargers (7-4), plus have matchups against the 2024 season's top NFC seed in the Lions (7-4) and the three-time defending AFC champion Chiefs (6-5). For the Cowboys to make the postseason, they would likely have to finish the year no worse than 5-1, bringing their overall record to 10-6-1. That's a nearly impossible tightrope to walk against this remaining schedule, which is why SportsLine gives Dallas an 11.4% chance to reach the playoffs.Projected final record: 10-6-1\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. San Francisco 49ers (8-4)Odds to win NFC West: +1100Odds to make playoffs: -750CBS' SportsLine model's playoff percentage: 81.1%Running back Christian McCaffrey is producing at a level somewhat close to his 2023 NFL Offensive Player of the Year season, with more than 600 yards rushing (626) and 600 yards receiving (692). He leads the league in both scrimmage yards (1,581) and touches this season. His All-Pro-caliber production is helping paper over quarterback Brock Purdy's gruesome 8-7 touchdown to interception ratio.\nIt's also remarkable that the 49ers have been a near-top 10 scoring defense (21.8 points per game, 11th in the NFL) despite losing both All-Pro edge rusher Nick Bosa and All-Pro inside linebacker Fred Warner to season-ending injuries. That's why they have an NFL-worst 13 team sacks this season. Defensive coordinator Robert Saleh is a miracle worker in the Bay Area, and that should be enough for the 49ers to return to the playoffs in 2025. That's especially true considering the 49ers have the Browns and Titans on their schedule the back half of the season. Projected final record: 11-6\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Detroit Lions (7-4)Odds to win NFC North: +170Odds to make playoffs: -290CBS' SportsLine model's playoff percentage: 70.6%The Lions survived a near-disaster in Week 12 with a 34-27 overtime victory over the now-2-9 New York Giants thanks to Pro Bowl running back Jahmyr Gibbs going off for 219 yards rushing and two touchdowns on just 14 carries while also catching 11 passes for 45 yards receiving and a touchdown. The Lions' schedule is one of the 10 toughest remaining lineups in the league, as their opponents have a combined .606 winning percentage, giving Detroit the league's fourth toughest remaining slate. Games against the Packers (a team they lost to in Week 1), Rams and Steelers should be very educational as to how Detroit's 2025 season will turn out. This week's Thanksgiving matchup against Green Bay will be pivotal. \nProjected final record: 11-6\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. Green Bay Packers (7-3-1)Odds to win NFC North: +130Odds to make playoffs: -375CBS' SportsLine model's playoff percentage: 78.9%The Packers are currently 7-3-1, but they have the potential to be significantly better. They have one of the best defenses in football, allowing just 18.4 points per game -- the fifth fewest in the NFL. All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons is making a difference for Green Bay with his 60 quarterback pressures, tied for the third-most in the league this season, to go along with 10.0 sacks, the fifth most in the NFL. Pro Bowl edge rusher Rashan Gary is on pace for a career-high in sacks with 7.5 already, tied for the 11th most in the NFL, and both linebacker Quay Walker and linebacker Edgerrin Cooper are thriving off of the added attention Parsons attracts. Oh, and Green Bay can stop the run, allowing the sixth-fewest rushing yards per game (96.5) this season However, a number of factors have led the Packers to rank in the middle of the pack in scoring offense (23.9 points per game, 13th in the NFL this season), despite quarterback Jordan Love performing at a top 10 level in 2025 -- 0.18 expected points added (EPA) per play, the fourth-best in the NFL this season. \nInjuries along the offensive line to center Elgton Jenkins and right tackle Zach Tom, have hurt, as well as regression by left tackle Rasheed Walker. That's hampered Pro Bowl running back Josh Jacobs' efficiency, as he is averaging 3.8 yards per carry, the second lowest of his career. However, he is still finding the end zone: his 11 rushing touchdowns are the second most in the NFL this season.The offensive line issues are also impacting the passing game, both in execution and play-calling: the Packers' 38.3% quarterback pressure rate ranks 22nd in the league.Having a below-average pass-blocking unit and being without both tight end Tucker Kraft (torn ACL) and wide receiver Jayden Reed (foot injury) has led to head coach Matt LaFleur calling a conservative game plan this season: Green Bay is calling running plays on 51% of their first- and second-down plays this season, the third-highest rate in the NFL. LaFleur is also calling play-action passes at just a 17% rate, 23rd in the league. Mixing it up with more passes and more play-action on early downs to make better use of Love's arm and the speed of wide receivers like Christian Watson and first-round rookie Matthew Golden could cause a significant uptick in offensive production. Reed returning from injury -- his 21-day practice window has been open -- would also be huge. If that happens, Green Bay could easily climb up the standings. The talent is there, even with the offensive injury issues. Projected final record: 12-4-1\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Seattle Seahawks (8-3)Odds to win NFC West: +400Odds to make playoffs: -2500CBS' SportsLine model's playoff percentage: 89.8%The Seattle Seahawks joined the ranks of wild card squads entering Week 12 after their narrow 21-19 road defeat at the Los Angeles Rams, which ended on a 61-yard missed field goal. However, the Seahawks will face the Rams again in Week 16. Depending on how that game and the next few weeks go, Seattle could certainly regain first place in the NFC West. Seattle quarterback Sam Darnold leads the NFL with a 9.3 yards-per-pass-attempt average. Offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak and Darnold bounced back nicely in Week 12 at the 1-10 Tennessee Titans after Darnold threw for 244 yards and two touchdowns on 16 of 26 passing. The Seahawks now have a chance to put up big numbers once again thanks to facing the collapsing Minnesota Vikings (4-7). \nProjected final record: 13-4\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Nebraska is again wondering about the future of its starting quarterback Dylan Raiola.The Huskers held on to Raiola last offseason after his camp had informal conversations with other programs about potentially entering the transfer portal. There is a sense in Lincoln that this offseason may be different as Nebraska is bracing for Raiola to explore leaving, sources tell CBS Sports. Raiola has not played since Nov. 1 after breaking his fibula. His younger brother, Dayton Raiola, decommitted from Nebraska's 2026 class last week -- sending the rumor mill into action. Dominic Raiola, father of Dylan and Dayton and a former All-American at Nebraska, declined to comment when reached about this story and Dylan's future. \n        \n            \n                Dayton Raiola, younger brother of Nebraska quarterback Dylan Raiola, decommits from Cornhuskers\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDylan, a former five-star recruit and one of the program's biggest signing splashes in its history, made about $3.5 million this season. He is Nebraska's highest-paid player; that intake also puts him near the top of all college football players. \nAny transfer decision would not be about money -- Nebraska is expected to increase its total NIL/rev-share payout next season, sources say, and will spend heavily in the coming weeks to keep vital roster pieces intact this offseason -- and would instead, for both parties, offer a blank slate as Raiola enters his potential final year of college football with the NFL Draft and a potential College Football Playoff appearance on his mind. Raiola threw for 2,000 yards and 18 touchdowns against six interceptions in most of 10 games in 2025 Many dominoes remain in the 2026 transfer portal quarterback market, and there's no guarantee Dylan would choose to leave or even find a better spot elsewhere. A fractured fibula would not imperil Raiola's chances of beginning the 2026 season on time. Last offseason, Carson Beck transferred from Georgia to Miami and warranted a nearly $4 million pricetag despite a torn UCL in his throwing elbow. November and December is a common time for contract leverage in this era of college athletics. Players are being shopped across the country. But the Raiola situation is considered tenuous after Dayton's decision to open his recruitment and with the knowledge that Raiola's camp mulled transferring last season. \nIn an interview earlier this year, Dominic denied that Dylan ever gave any real consideration to leaving the program last winter. But there were trial balloons sent out -- and coach Matt Rhule did sit down with his then-freshman quarterback in the days leading up to the portal's opening to make sure they were on the same page.\"I just had one authentic and long conversation with Dylan, and he made the decision,\" Rhule told CBS Sports in September. \"Then I said, 'OK, let's go out and get the players you want and that I want (in order) to be the team we want to be moving forward.'\"Nebraska indeed went heavy in the portal in the 2025 cycle after confirming Raiola's return, adding multiple four-star prospects at key positions such as wide receiver, offensive line and EDGE. \nNebraska began the season 6-2 (including a close home loss to now-No. 16 Michigan) before Raiola went down against USC on Nov. 1 in an eventual 21-17 loss. The Huskers are 1-1 since his injury and are coming off a blowout loss at Penn State. Nebraska, which will be bowl-bound for the second consecutive year, wraps up the regular season Friday against Iowa (12 p.m. ET, CBS). The Huskers are bullish on the future of their quarterback room. The early returns on freshman quarterback TJ Lateef, who started in Raiola's absence, are strong. He's thrown for 653 yards, 4 touchdowns, no interceptions and is completing 70.4% of his passes. Nebraska also has a verbal commitment from its top target in the 2027 class, Trae Taylor, the No. 35 overall prospect in the country.The college football transfer portal does not officially open until Jan. 2, but that will not slow news of expected entries and back-room negotiations across the country. They have already started and will only pick up once most teams conclude their season this weekend. \n\n    \n                                        \n    The Husker247.com staff has more than 50 years experience covering Nebraska athletics.

    "body": "\n        The holidays are upon us, and the next gift is a battle of NFC heavyweights in the NFL's third annual Black Friday contest. Except the Chicago Bears and Philadelphia Eagles, who will square off at Lincoln Financial Field, are in much different places.Few expected Chicago to be 8-3 after Thanksgiving, even with an anticipated boost under the direction of new coach Ben Johnson. In fact, plenty of Bears players are probably just as surprised about the team's standing, considering how many of Windy City's victories have come as a result of last-minute heroics.The Eagles are also 8-3, which isn't a surprising record for the reigning Super Bowl champions. But that record might also be a bit deceiving: While Vic Fangio's defense has remained stingy, allowing barely 20 points per game, the Birds' big-name offense is producing below its paygrade, with the once-vaunted O-line struggling to clear running lanes for Saquon Barkley.As both the Bears and Eagles survive on the margins, which side is due for victory on Friday? It's a must-see matchup either way.\nBet Eagles vs. Bears at Bet365 Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets using the bonus code CBSBET365:Here's everything you need to know to catch the Black Friday showdown, including key matchups and our prediction:Where to watch Eagles vs. Bears liveDate: Friday, Nov. 28 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Lincoln Financial Field (Philadelphia)Stream: Prime Video*Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Eagles -7, O/U 44.5 (via DraftKings Sportsbook)*Note: This Prime Video broadcast is free; it does not require an Amazon Prime subscription, just an Amazon account.\nKey questions\n                                                                    Imagn Images\n                                                            Can Saquon Barkley finally break free? Very little is going right for the reigning Offensive Player of the Year. Not only is the running back's formerly dominant line struggling to meet expectations, with Lane Johnson banged up and fellow lynchpins like Cam Jurgens and Landon Dickerson losing ground, but Barkley himself seems to lack some of the pre-contact burst that made him a monster in 2024. Perhaps this is just the defense he needs to face, as Chicago's linebacker corps is all bruised up, and Dennis Allen's unit, though opportunistic with an NFL-leading 24 takeaways, ranks 28th in run defense.How will Ben Johnson attack the Eagles' secondary? Caleb Williams has been a bit scattershot as the Bears' signal-caller, but one thing he's done well is control the ball, with just four interceptions on the year. This might be the time Johnson lets Williams air it out, however, with Philly in the middle of another cornerback shuffle. Adoree' Jackson is banged up on the outside, and both Reed Blankenship and Andrew Mukuba are also hurt at safety, leaving the Eagles vulnerable against the deep ball.Can Philly's front fluster Caleb Williams? Again, Williams has done a decent job protecting the rock even while the Bears have endured streaky stretches as an offense. But if there's one thing the Eagles defense does well, it's disrupt in the trenches, with freakish front-seven standouts like Jalen Carter and Zack Baun always around the ball. The last time Chicago faced a top-10 defense according to DVOA grades, the Bears struggled mightily to keep up with the rival Detroit Lions.You can bet Eagles vs. Bears at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:X factor to watch\nTwo years after logging his first career 1,000-yard rushing season as the No. 1 back for the Eagles, Swift will be back in Philly as part of a hit-or-miss Bears tandem. While rookie Kyle Monangai may be Chicago's new \"finisher\" and/or top overall ball carrier, Swift remains a home run threat with top-end breakaway burst. And the Eagles have proven vulnerable when defending the run, allowing Javonte Williams and Malik Davis to gain 111 combined yards in the Dallas Cowboys' Week 12 comeback win. It wouldn't be a shock if Ben Johnson tries to scheme up open-field opportunities for Swift to stretch the field against his old team.Prediction\nThe Bears just keep finding ways to win. Which is kind of what we usually say about the Eagles. So which team is for real? Which one has a more authentic 8-3 mark going into Black Friday's showdown? Forgive us if we tend to side with the defending champs.\nChicago is no doubt proving scrappy under Johnson's watch, and if Dennis Allen's defense can find a way to force a loose ball against the Birds as the Cowboys did, well, we could be in for a real stunner at the Linc. The injuries at the back end of the Eagles' own defense aren't anything to overlook, either.All that said, there's still a clear disparity in top-end talent when you put these teams head to head. If Jalen Hurts, A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith can't gut one out at home against this group, even on a short week after a tough divisional loss, then it'll really be time to sound the alarms in Philadelphia. Or just put some genuine respect on the Bears' name.Pick: Eagles 27, Bears 17 | Eagles -7, Under 44.5\n            ",

    "body": "\n        UConn coach Jim Mora is leaving the program after four seasons to become the next coach at Colorado State, the school announced Wednesday, ending one of the most successful -- and unexpected -- rebuilds in recent college football memory. Huskies athletic director David Benedict said Mora informed him late Tuesday night that he had accepted the Rams' offer, bringing a close to a tenure that pulled UConn from irrelevance to national competitiveness in a short span.\"We are grateful for coach Mora's contributions to UConn over the past four seasons,\" Benedict said in a release. \"He took on the challenge of rebuilding our football program and delivered results that exceeded expectations. Under his leadership, the Huskies won 27 games and achieved bowl eligibility in three of his four seasons, including back-to-back nine-win seasons for the first time in program history.\"Mora, 64, leaves Storrs with a 27-23 record, including back-to-back nine-win seasons -- the first in program history -- and three bowl berths in four years. UConn completed its regular season schedule this past Saturday with a 9-3 record, with all three losses coming in overtime, and awaits its bowl assignment as an FBS Independent.\n        \n            \n                Next Cowboy up: Why Eric Morris is the perfect successor to Mike Gundy at Oklahoma State\n                \n                    Shehan Jeyarajah                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe turnaround marks a stark contrast from the decade that preceded his arrival, when UConn reached only one bowl game over 11 seasons and cycled through multiple coaching staffs. Mora, who spent several years away from the sideline before resurfacing at UConn, not only stabilized the program but expanded its recruiting reach, boosting the school's NIL infrastructure despite competing against resource-rich programs with major conference payouts.\nHis next challenge is replacing Jay Norvell at Colorado State, which is preparing to move from the Mountain West to the reconfigured Pac-12 under new athletic director John Weber. The Rams have played in just one bowl since 2017 and are on their fourth head coach since 2019. CSU fired Norvell in October after a 2-5 start to his fourth season with the program. Norvell went just 18-26 with the Rams, and Weber has been vocal about elevating Colorado State into a top-tier Group of Six program. The school is expected to back Mora with significant financial resources -- an area where UConn has traditionally been at a disadvantage.Mora brings a deep résumé to Fort Collins. His 10 college seasons include six at UCLA, where he won at least eight games four times and posted a pair of top-20 finishes. He is still the only coach in 25 years to lead the Bruins to two double-digit win seasons in a tenure.Mora also authored an 11-5 debut season with the Atlanta Falcons in 2004, reaching the NFC Championship Game, and later served as coach of the Seattle Seahawks for one season in 2009. In total, he has spent nearly two decades in the NFL as a head coach, assistant and coordinator.\nUConn, which plays football as an independent, now enters another transition as Benedict said the school will immediately begin a national search for its next coach. Offensive coordinator Gordon Sammis will serve as the Huskies' interim coach as they await a bowl invitation.\n            ",

I ran a lot, I scored a lot of goals but above all, I've always had pretty good vision of the game and since I was a little kid.\"I don't know, watching Messi especially, he made different passes because I've seen a lot of players who are very good at passing who made long passes but Messi made passes that were almost a goal and I would learn from that. I've seen [Luka] Modric make passes with the outside of the foot. Those are things I really liked and found more interesting than dribbling because they're somewhat more clever.\"\nFor the entire interview make sure to tune into 60 Minutes Sunday, Nov. 30 when the Barcelona star sits down with Jon Wertheim to talk about his meteoric rise. And for all of the UEFA Champions League action each week check out Paramount+, CBS Sports Network and CBS Sports Golazo Network.Yamal is also renowned for his goalscoring ability, currently standing at 37 goals in 144 games for club and country in his short career. The 18-year-old said there are four goals that stick out in his mind as favorites but he singled out two, the first being his goal in Spain's 2-1 win over France in the semifinals of Euro 2024, a tournament his side went on to win.\nThe second was just this month in Barcelona's 3-3 win at Club Brugge in the UEFA Champions League, a stellar strike taken with the inside of his foot.\n\"If I had to choose only one, I think in terms of importance and beauty, it'd be the goal against France at the Euros and I also really like the one against Brugge.\"\n            ",

New York has been putrid at Madison Square Garden, but the team has been terrific on the road. Those performances away from home are the only reason the Rangers are still afloat in the East.\n                        \n                            2\n                        \n                            11-11-2\n                        \n                                24\n                            \n                                    Sharks\n                                \n                            Youth | The thing about inexperience is that it can be the source of mistakes, but it can also provide a franchise with some juice. That's what Macklin Celebrini, Will Smith, William Eklund and Yaroslav Askarov have done. The future is very sunny in the Bay Area.\n                        \n                            2\n                        \n                            11-9-3\n                        \n                                25\n                            \n                                    Blue Jackets\n                                \n                            Cap space | The Blue Jackets have some really intriguing young pieces -- or at least pieces still in their prime -- and they have the flexibility to build around them. Columbus has almost $13 million in space now, and it's projected for $46 million in space next summer.\n                        \n                            2\n                        \n                            11-9-3\n                        \n                                26\n                            \n                                    Oilers\n                                \n                            Proof of concept | This start would be very worrisome for the Oilers if they hadn't done this in each of the last two years before going on a Stanley Cup Final run. Edmonton has proven it can dig itself out of a hole, even if this season feels a little different in a bad way.\n                        \n                            2\n                        \n                            10-10-5\n                        \n                                27\n                            \n                                    Sabres\n                                \n                            Josh Allen | If it weren't for Josh Allen, Buffalo would be a much more miserable place this time of year, and fans would have more time to direct their ire at the Sabres. Thankfully, Allen and his rocket arm give the fine folks of Buffalo something to look forward to.\n                        \n                            1\n                        \n                            9-9-4\n                        \n                                28\n                            \n                                    Maple Leafs\n                                \n                            Parity | The difference between the last playoff spot and last place in the East is five points, and the Maple Leafs have two games in hand. Toronto may be in last place, but the extreme parity in the conference should give the team and its fans plenty of hope.\n                        \n                            1\n                        \n                            9-10-3\n                        \n                                29\n                            \n                                    Blues\n                                \n                            The Thanksgiving break | With just one win in their last six games, the Blues are like a fighter just trying to reach the bell. This is also around the exact date St. Louis began its turnaround last season, but there will be no coaching change this time around, so the team has to find answers from within.\n                        \n                            1\n                        \n                            7-10-6\n                        \n                                30\n                            \n                                    Flames\n                                \n                            Regression | This may sound crazy to say, but the Flames look pretty good under the hood, especially on defense. At five-on-five, only the Senators allow expected goals at a lower rate than Calgary. If Dustin Wolf finds his game in net, the Flames could push back into the wild card mix.\n                        \n                            2\n                        \n                            8-13-3\n                        \n                                31\n                            \n                                    Canucks\n                                \n                            Quinn Hughes | Love him while you've got him, Vancouver! With each passing loss, it looks more and more like Hughes' future could be in a different uniform.\n                        \n                            2\n                        \n                            9-12-2\n                        \n                                32\n                            \n                                    Predators\n                                \n                            Titans | In seasons like this, the Predators benefit from being in football country, especially when the Titans are the only NFL team with just one win. They've really been taking some heat off the Preds locally.\n                        \n                            1\n                        \n                            6-12-4\n                        \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

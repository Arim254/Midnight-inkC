    "body": "\n        Two teams coming off wins in Week 9 will meet in Week 10 of the 2025 NFL season as the Baltimore Ravens head to the Midwest to face the Minnesota Vikings. The Ravens got Lamar Jackson back from a hamstring injury in Week 9 and he looked healthy, throwing for 204 yards and four touchdown passes in a win over the Dolphins. The Vikings also got their quarterback back from an injury in J.J. McCarthy, who threw for two scores and rushed for another in a win over the Lions.Kickoff from U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis is set for 1 p.m. ET.

The former LSU star badly injured his elbow in last week's loss to the Seattle Seahawks, meaning it will instead be backup Marcus Mariota under center for Washington. Kickoff from Northwest Stadium is set for 4:25 p.m. ET.

    "body": "\n        Gabriel Bonfim is more than a grappler. Heading into Saturday's UFC Fight Night, many thought Bonfim's submission skills would carry him to victory. Instead, he chewed up Randy Brown's leg before knocking him out with a brutal knee in the second round from Las Vegas.Bonfim systematically disassembled Brown, who was the more reputable striker. Bonfim immediately got to work, targeting Brown's lead leg with calf strikes. The damage added up quickly as Brown started switching stances and preemptively picking his leg up off the mat. What happened early in Round 2, however, sparked more dialogue than the good work preceding it.Bonfim landed a clinch knee that took him off his feet and  dropped Brown. Bonfim quickly stood up and ran over to deal additional  blows to his grounded opponent. Before he could, referee Mark Smith  intervened and waved it off. Brown protested the stoppage, but it's unlikely he would've fared better had the fight continued. \nUpon closer inspection, it appeared that Brown was knocked out and  awoke once he hit the mat. After Bonim landed the knee, Brown slowly  fell backwards, his head smacking against the mat. He looked dazed as he  slowly raised his hands to block Bonfim's inevitable incoming barrage.  \nPost-fight, Bonfim reflected on his performance before calling out former UFC welterweight title challenger Colby Covington.\"We knew the calf was something. We knew to punish that, and that the knee would show up,\" Bonfim said, according to Portuguese interpreter Fabiano Buskei. \"Colby, stop running. Stop running away. We are the Bonfim brothers. Give me the chance to knock you out of the rankings... I'm going to retire him.\"It was a bittersweet evening for the Bonfim brothers. While Gabriel scored one of his biggest wins to date, Ismael wasn't so lucky. \nChris Padilla knocked out the elder Bonfim brother after wearing him out. Gabriel Bonfim improved to 18-1 with a three-fight winning streak. Ismael Bonfim dropped to 20-5 and has lost three of his last four.\n            ",

It wasn't quarterback Drake Maye's best game and it will take a better showing to defeat Tampa. The Patriots have been praised for their quick turnaround by some, while others are hesitant to give them credit until they can beat more top teams. If New Engalnd can defeat Tampa Bay -- which is no easy task -- they'll quiet some of those doubters.Bet Buccaneers vs. Patriots at Bet365 Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets using the bonus code CBSBET365. Click here to get started:The Buccaneers defeated the New Orleans Saints easily in their last game and the week prior fell to the Detroit Lions, 24-9. Tampa's other loss this season came to the defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles. Tampa Bay's defense knows how to pressure the quarterback and are a complete unit under coach Todd Bowles. The Bucs' blitz package is something a young quarterback, like Drake Maye, will need to anticipate.The Bucs are coming off a bye, so they have extra rest and time to prepare. Crucially, teams coming off a bye, when their opponent is not, are 6-0 so far this season.Where to watch Patriots vs. Buccaneers liveDate: Sunday, Nov. 9 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: Raymond James Stadium -- Tampa, FloridaTV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Buccaneers -2.5; O/U 48.5 (via DraftKings)    Patriots vs. Buccaneers: Need to knowBaker Mayfield vs. Drake Maye. Both quarterbacks are having stellar seasons. Mayfield has a 63.9 completion percentage (23rd), 1,919 yards (11th), 13 touchdowns (14th) against only two interceptions. Maye currently has a league-best 74.1 completion percentage, along with 2,285 passing yards (fifth), 17 touchdowns (tied for third) and just four interceptions. These quarterbacks are two of the most fun to watch in the league and who has the better game may be the difference maker on Sunday. Two solid rush defenses. Just like these teams are benefiting from solid quarterback play, both squads have notable defenses. The Patriots have allowed just 679 total rushing yards, which is best in the league. The Bucs have held their opponents to 741 yards on the ground, and that's sixth-best. The Patriots run game is middle of the pack, with 1,011 yards, eight touchdowns and 3.9 yards per carry, while the Bucs' comes in at the lower end of the spectrum, with 785 yards, six touchdowns and 3.8 yards per carry.How will the Buccaneers' injuries play a role? Wide receiver Chris Godwin (fibula) and running back Bucky Irving (foot/shoulder) are among two players who did not practice on Wednesday. Godwin has played just two games this season, with the last coming on Oct. 5. Irving has played in four games this year and hasn't seen the field since Sept. 28.Patriots vs. Buccaneers prediction, pick\nI think fans are in for a treat with this one, as two playoff contenders from different conferences face off. I think this will be a close one that could come down to which team makes fewer mistakes. Pick: Patriots, Over 48.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

His injury is one of several the Commanders have experienced this year, and Marcus Mariota will make his fourth start in place of Daniels this season.\nWhere to watch Commanders vs. Lions liveDate: Sunday, Nov. 9 | Time: 4:25 p.m. ETWhere: Northwest Stadium -- Landover, MarylandTV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Lions -8.5; O/U 48.5 (via FanDuel)Commanders vs. Lions: Need to knowLions look to get offense back on track. Jared Goff got sacked five times, and Detroit managed just 65 rushing yards last week. The Lions' 305 yards of offense represented their fifth consecutive game with 380 yards or fewer, their longest streak since 2021. Overall, the Lions have slipped to 11th in yards per game this season; they were second last year. Offensive coordinator John Morton, Goff and star running back Jahmyr Gibbs should have ample opportunities to get back on track, though. Washington is allowing over 410 yards per game over their past four games, the second-highest in the NFL.Aidan Hutchinson, rest of pass rush aim to get after Marcus Mariota. After signing a massive extension with the Lions last week, Hutchinson had a sack and seven pressures against the Vikings. He has seven sacks this season and will look to add to that total against a Washington offensive line susceptible to the pass rush. Washington quarterbacks have taken 24 sacks this season, tied for ninth-most in the NFL entering Week 10, and Mariota has taken multiple sacks in three of the four games he's seen significant action in this season.Washington trying to find bright spots. The Commanders have been outscored 135-67 during their four-game losing streak, the worst point margin in the NFL since Week 6. Not only is Daniels out, but so, too is Terry McLaurin as well as several other key contributors. At this point, Washington is hoping to find anything positive to take forward. Keep an eye on rookie right tackle Josh Conerly Jr., rookie cornerback Trey Amos and some other youngsters who will figure heavily into Washington's future as it plays out the string this season.Commanders vs. Lions pick, prediction\nThis one seems pretty straight forward. Washington has been one of the worst defensive teams in the NFL over the past several weeks, making this a perfect get-right game for Detroit. This was always going to be a tough challenge for Washington even if Daniels was healthy considering how poorly the defense is playing. Without him, victory is a near impossibility. Pick: Lions -8.5; Over 48.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

We're still waiting for the offseason's first significant move, but now that qualifying offers have been issued, that should come soon. Here are the latest hot stove nuggets now that Munetaka Murakami has been posted for MLB teams.   Blue Jays want to re-sign Bichette \nNot surprisingly, the Blue Jays want to re-sign star shortstop Bo Bichette, GM Ross Atkins told reporters (via Sportsnet). Atkins added that Toronto has a \"good bit of versatility\" on its infield in case Bichette signs elsewhere. We ranked Bichette as the third best free agent available this offseason and project him to receive a seven-year contract worth $189 million. The Blue Jays could play Andrés Giménez at short, Addison Barger at third, and Ernie Clement at second should Bichette leave, though they would be losing a significant bat and a beloved homegrown player. Still only 27, Bichette is one of the youngest free agents on the market this offseason. He posted a 120 OPS+ for the sixth time in seven MLB seasons in 2025. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     \tPadres expected to extend Preller Padres POBO A.J. Preller is expected to sign a contract extension in the coming days, reports The Athletic. San Diego will introduce new manager Craig Stammen at a press conference Monday and Preller's extension should be finalized by then. Preller, 48, has been the club's lead baseball operations executive since August 2014. The Padres have been to the postseason four times in the last six seasons after reaching the postseason five times in the franchise's first 51 years. \n \tBraves re-sign Carrasco \nThe Braves have re-signed veteran righty Carlos Carrasco to a minor-league contract, according to Baseball America. Now 38, Carrasco made three ineffective starts for Atlanta this past season after beginning the year with the Yankees. He is far removed from his prime -- Carrasco has a 5.50 ERA since 2021 -- though the Braves continue to value him as a depth starter, and Carrasco wants to continue playing, so the two sides reunited early this offseason. \n            \n    ",

CBS Sports Golazo will be your place to see the action as league leaders Cruz Azul host Pumas UNAM and Toluca hosts Club America. While all four teams have qualified for the playoffs, the race for the elusive top spot is on the line. Already ahead by a point, all Cruz Azul needs is a victory to take the top spot, but if they fail to win, that's when things can get interesting. Toluca and Club America only trail by a point, and they have superior goal difference, so a Cruz Azul loss and a draw in that game would see Toluca win the league, while if Cruz Azul loses, the winner between Toluca and Club America will take the top spot. If Cruz Azul fail to win while America and Toluca finish in a draw, then Tigres can even rise from fourth in the league to take the top spot. It has been a closely contested battle atop the league, and that's only highlighted by the fact that any of the four teams can come out on top heading into the playoffs. Pumas will have added motivation to upset things as with a win over Cruz Azul, not only can they impact the title race, but that would also be enough to make the final spot in the playoffs. Given that 10 of the 18 teams in the league qualify for playoffs, missing out would be quite a disappointment for Pumas, but they'll have a tough road to climb.Liga MX scores and scheduleFriday, Nov. 7Juarez 1, Queretaro 2Mazaltan 1, Necaxa 1Club Tijuana 2, Atlas 0Saturday, Nov. 8\nTigres UNAL vs. San Luis, 6 p.m. (Universo)Chivas Guadalajara vs, Monterrey, 6:07 p.m. (Telemundo)Club Leon vs. Puebla, 8 p.m. (Vix)Toluca vs. Club America, 8 pm.

    "body": "\n        In a decisive game three, who else but Lionel Messi to push Inter Miami past Nashville SC and into the conference semifinal of the MLS Cup playoffs? Behind two goals from the Argentine, the Herons secured a 4-0 victory in what could be their final game at Chase Stadium on Saturday. Messi secured his brace by halftime with the Inter Miami cutting through Nashville's defense, and even with Luis Suarez suspended, the Herons had no issue making it past Nashville. But while Messi's exploits were important, this is also the first time that Miami have kept a clean sheet in the playoffs, which is also significant.\nNashville are a side that Messi enjoys facing as the Argentine has now scored 15 goals in his 10 appearances against them -- a number that would rank 12th in Messi's goals scored against La Liga clubs in league play during his illustrious Barcelona career. But as he marches towards a second consecutive MLS MVP award, Messi again showed how indispensable he is to the team while also having a little fun in the process, megging Nashville midfielder Edvard Tagseth, who could only laugh about it.\nIn the second half, Tadeo Allende played the closer's role with a brace of his own to give Miami their final advantage to move onto the next round. While the Herons will get Suarez back for that match, 19-year-old Mateo Silvetti led the line well, assisting one of Messi's goals as the Herons are now able to begin putting last season's nightmare elimination against Atlanta United where it belongs -- in the past.The Herons lost in the first round to Atlanta last season behind an epic performance from Brad Guzan in net, but now that they've gotten out of the first round, Miami can look to win the first MLS Cup title in club history. During a season with high expectations, a trophy was an expectation, and there's still a chance to send Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets into retirement in the best way possible with an MLS Cup title.\nWhere was Suarez?Suarez picked up a one-match suspension for kicking Nashville SC's Andy Najar during game two of this series. While the incident wasn't caught live, the MLS Disciplinary Committee reviewed it and deemed Suarez's conduct to be worthy of a suspension. Miami defender Ian Fray was also fined for simulation. Since it was only a one-game suspension, Suarez will be available for Miami's upcoming trip to face FC Cincinnati, but it's a growth moment where we could be seeing the future of the nine for Miami in Silvetti. After Messi, Suarez has been the next most effective attacker on the team with 14 goals and 15 assists in all competitions, so his return will be welcome.What's next?The Herons will head to face FC Cincinnati on Friday, Nov. 21, with a spot in the Conference final on the line. With Inter Miami being the three seed, they'll only return home if they win that match and are pitted against New York City FC in the Eastern Conference final. If Miami make it to MLS Cup and face a team with a lower place than them, they'll end up hosting the MLS Cup. The Herons can get ahead of themselves because it's a long way to go to getting past Cincinnati, let alone making it to MLS Cup.\nWith Miami Freedom Park scheduled to open ahead of next season, this could be the final game that Chase Stadium sees the Herons play but as long as it doesn't come with an early end to the season, Javier Mascherano and the Herons won't be too sad about that. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        LUBBOCK, Texas -- Texas Tech linebacker Jacob Rodriguez has become something of a celebrity around campus. Fans have started sporting his signature mustache in the stands, and his No. 10 jersey trails only Patrick Mahomes' No. 5 for most sported at Jones AT&T Stadium. Rodriguez's numbers have been sensational, and his stat line for No. 8 Texas Tech in a dominant 29-7 win against No. 7 BYU marked one of his best -- 14 tackles, a tackle for loss, an interception returned deep into opposing territory. He has shepherded the Red Raiders through a defensive transition, going from a good player on a bad defense last year to one of the best players in college football in 2025. \"The Heisman is given to the best football player, it's not given to the best quarterback,\" Texas Tech coach Joey McGuire said. \"They have awards for that. You can't say that Jacob Rodriguez, at his position, isn't playing the best at his position in the country, as elite and as good as anybody in the country.\" The last time a linebacker at Texas Tech was such a household name was when an undersized Hall of Famer from Pampa named Zach Thomas was making the calls. And during a historic win for the Red Raiders, Rodriguez's defense played one of the best games of the season. \nBYU's offense presents numerous challenges with its misdirection and option concepts. Dual-threat quarterback Bear Bachmeier also rarely goes down and was only sacked once by defensive tackle Lee Hunter. But while havoc plays came at a premium, it was down-to-down excellence that stood apart at Texas Tech. Eight players recorded at least four tackles with very few misses in space. Seven players combined for eight passes defended. Four players recorded quarterback hurries and four recorded a single tackle for loss each. On a day where the offense had struggles early, the defense and special teams kept them alive. Formally, Texas Tech doesn't keep track of attendance over the stadium capacity of 60,229, but every nook and cranny was packed. For most of the afternoon, though, it wasn't a loud crowd. Despite taking a two-score lead, nerves trumped emotion. \n\n        \n            \n                West Texas boom: Inside Texas Tech's bold all-in bet on NIL and the billionaire landman responsible\n                \n                    Shehan Jeyarajah                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBut late in the third quarter, Rodriguez tipped a third-down pass from Bachmeier and returned it to the edge of the red zone. For the first moment of the afternoon, emotion flowed. One drive later, the Red Raiders finally got into the end zone for the second time and the party was on. \"We can rely on the defense,\" McGuire said. \"Anytime, no matter what's going on in football at any level, if you can play defense and run the football, you're going to have an opportunity to be in games.\" The results against BYU's highly touted running game were off the charts. The Cougars came into the matchup averaging 216 yards rushing per game. They mustered only 67 yards rushing on 2.5 carries against Texas Tech. Bachmeier was pushed to throw more in the second half, recording a career high 38 pass attempts, but the Cougars were held to only 3.9 yards per play. \nMcGuire came to Texas Tech after spending most of his career as a high school coach. While he isn't schematically tied to any system, defense and physicality has always been his calling card. There were questions about how he'd be able to build that kind of culture after transferring in several key defensive pieces. However, returners like Rodriguez and John Curry took it as a challenge. Everyone came to Lubbock for an opportunity to change everything. And after outlasting BYU, Texas Tech has formally completed the journey from a bottom 10 national defense to a top 10 unit. Texas Tech -- yes, Texas Tech -- has a championship level defense. \"We are so close,\" Rodriguez said. \"This is the most fun I've ever had playing football. It's not just offense, defense, special teams -- it's the whole team. Everybody cares about each other. We've got to be one of the closest teams in the country.\" \nWith the win, Texas Tech virtually clinches a spot in the Big 12 Championship Game for the first time in program history. Only games against struggling UCF and West Virginia teams remain. If the Red Raiders enter the postseason with only one loss, they can likely punch their ticket to the College Football Playoff -- win or lose. Rodriguez started his career as a quarterback at Virginia. He returned home to West Texas and switched positions, trusting the staff. After 10 games, Rodriguez has 91 tackles, 9.5 tackles for loss, three interceptions, seven forced fumbles and five passes defended. Will it be enough to receive an invitation to the Heisman Trophy ceremony in December? It remains to be seen. But it will be enough to compete for a championship. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        In a two-minute situation with no timeouts, Indiana relied on Heisman candidate Fernando Mendoza to deliver the most clutch drive of his collegiate career during Saturday's 27-24 victory at Penn State.The Hoosiers' hurry-up in front of 100,000-plus at Beaver Stadium culminated with Mendoza's 7-yard toss to Omar Cooper Jr. in the back of the end zone, who dazzled despite solid coverage and came down with the football with his left toe inbounds to push Indiana ahead.\"It was the most improbable victory I've been apart of and there couldn't have been a better place to make it happen,\" Indiana coach Curt Cignetti said after the game, noting Indiana's first win in program history at Penn State.The Nittany Lions had the unbeaten Hoosiers on the ropes following Nick Singleton's second touchdown of the fourth quarter to give Penn State a 24-20 lead after Indiana had once held a 13-point advantage.\n\n        \n            \n                No. 2 Indiana survives upset bid from Penn State thanks to insane Omar Cooper Jr. touchdown catch\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSacked on the first snap of the final drive, Mendoza picked himself off the turf and moved the chains with a completion to Cooper for a 22-yard gain to get the possession going for the Hoosiers.\"We refused to lose in the bleakest, most dire moments when it looked impossible,\" Cignetti said. \"Barely a minute to go and haven't gotten anything offensively in quite awhile, quarterback taking a lot of shots and to all the sudden start making plays like we made, incredible plays. \"To score at the end like that ... it's a game of inches, it truly is. This team refused to lose and I'm proud of this football team.\"\nIntercepted on a previous fourth-quarter pass attempt that gave Penn State a change-of-possession at Indiana's 44-yard line and led to a touchdown, Mendoza shook off the mistake and showed pinpoint accuracy in the final moments.\"The best thing I can say is we refused to lose,\" Cignetti said. \"We had that one last big run left in us. I guarantee you when Fernando got sacked on first down, how many people in this room counted us out? Right? Great drive.\"What's next for IndianaCignetti's now 21-2 at Indiana and pushed this season's record to 10-0 after debuting behind Ohio State in Tuesday night's first College Football Playoff rankings. With a win over Wisconsin next week, the Hoosiers lock in their first Big Ten Championship Game appearance in program history.\nIndiana reached the playoff for the first time last fall, but fell flat at Notre Dame in the first round, who eventually reached the national championship. This time around, getting to Indianapolis likely cements an opening-round bye for the Hoosiers, who would play in the Orange Bowl as the No. 3 seed behind the Buckeyes and projected SEC champion unless they're able to topple Ohio State.Indiana's strength of schedule ranks at the bottom of the teams currently inside the selection committee's top 4 and entering Saturday's win at Penn State, had the easiest slate remaining among playoff contenders based on the combined records of remaining opponents.Indiana had no Power Four opponents in its nonconference slate this season, while Ohio State played Texas, Alabama lost to Florida State and Texas A&M beat Notre Dame.\n\"Yeah, the schedule is the schedule,\" selection committee chair Mack Rhoades said earlier this week. \"We don't talk about scheduling philosophy and how any team scheduled. We just looked at hey, this is who they have on the schedule. This is the outcome of those games. Then looking at all of the metrics at our disposal.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        One of the biggest surprises in the new era of name, image, and likeness occurred less than 30 minutes before the deadline to withdraw from the 2025 NBA Draft passed. Alabama guard Labaron Philon, who most considered a likely late-first-round pick, elected to withdraw from the draft process during the 11th hour to return to school.Philon coming back not only gave Alabama a true building block for the 2025-26 season but also a chance for him to raise his stock and solidify himself as \"the guy\" after All-American guard Mark Sears departed the program. If Saturday was any indication of what's to come this season for the Crimson Tide, it is that Philon appears to be ready to meet the moment. Philon scored 25 points in No. 15 Alabama's 103-96 upset win over No. 5 St. John's at Madison Square Garden. Fifteen of his 25 points came after halftime. The Alabama star finished 10 of 17 from the floor and dished out three assists in just 29 minutes while dealing with foul trouble.\n        \n            \n                College basketball rankings: North Carolina ticks up in Top 25 And 1 as Caleb Wilson stars in win over Kansas\n                \n                    Gary Parrish                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHighlight to end the halfPerhaps one of the biggest shots of Philon's college career came in the final two minutes of regulation. With the Crimson Tide up seven, Philon knocked down a step-back 3-pointer to extend the lead to double-digits, which put the game away for good. St. John's trailed for a majority of the second half before storming back to take a brief lead with 6:09 remaining.\nPhilon showed flashes last season of why he was one of the best prospects in the 2024 recruiting cycle. He averaged 10.6 points, 3.8 assists and 3.3 rebounds in 37 games. However, Philon started just 29 games and took a backseat role at times to other players on the roster, including Sears and Grant Nelson -- who both averaged more points per game than Philon.\nOats rescues roster againSince Nate Oats arrived at Alabama in 2019, he has consistently retooled his rosters. Oats had to replace three assistant coaches and seven of his top nine scorers ahead of the 2023-24 season when the Crimson Tide reached the Final Four for the first time in program history. Perhaps this offseason was one of his toughest challenges yet, as it's hard to replace a player like Sears, who is one of the most accomplished in program history.But getting Philon back was one of the biggest wins of Oats' coaching career, and it should give the Crimson Tide a real chance to compete for another berth to the Final Four if he keeps playing like this. As of this weekend, Alabama had the 10th-best odds (+430), per FanDuel, to reach the Final Four.\nOats has traditionally scheduled a tough slate of preseason games since his arrival to Tuscaloosa. Last year, the Crimson Tide played Purdue, Illinois, Houston, Oregon and North Carolina before SEC play began. Alabama will face No. 1 Purdue on Thursday with games vs. Illinois, Gonzaga and Arizona in nonconference play before the calendar flips to the new year and SEC play begins.    This win over St. John's should signal a few things ahead of his team's upcoming gauntlet: Alabama is still in the mix among the best teams in the sport, and Philon has a real case to leave his mark on the program and solidify himself as a potential lottery pick this summer.\n    \n                                        \n    Bama247.com features the best team and recruiting coverage of the Crimson Tide in the Alabama market.

    "body": "\n        Fernando Mendoza is back in the driver's seat on the road to the Heisman Trophy. The Indiana quarterback delivered a game-winning drive for the ages in the Hoosiers' electric 27-24 win at Penn State and in turn climbed back into betting favorite status in the award race.Indiana's undefeated season was in extreme peril in the fourth quarter of the road trip to Beaver Stadium. A loss to a reeling Penn State team would have taken the Hoosiers out of full control of their Big Ten championship destiny. It was for moments like this why Curt Cignetti hand-picked Mendoza as his quarterback of choice in the transfer portal. And, man, did he prove worthy of every cent of NIL money it took to bring him to Bloomington.Trailing by four with 1:51 to play and no timeouts in his back pocket, Mendoza bounced back from a drive-opening sack and picked apart the Nittany Lions over the course of a clutch, 80-yard march down the field. He eventually hit Omar Cooper Jr. in the back of the end zone for his first touchdown pass of the day and one of the most eye-catching completions of the college football season.Cooper's remarkable play on the ball was a landmark moment in his star teammate's Heisman campaign.\nWhile he was far from his best for much of the day against a Penn State defense stacked with NFL talent, Mendoza elevated to prime form when the Hoosiers needed a hero. Over the first nine drives of the game, he was a modest 14-of-22 passing for 131 yards with an interception. With Indiana needing a touchdown, he went 5 of 8 for 87 yards and the game-winning strike.\nHeisman Trophy oddsOdds below via FanDuel Sportsbook. PlayerTeamOddsFernando MendozaIndiana+150Julian SayinOhio State+200Ty SimpsonAlabama+470Marcel ReedTexas A&M+850Gunner StocktonGeorgia+2000Jeremiah SmithOhio State+2500\"Late in the game, I threw a pick,\" Mendoza said postgame. \"That's on me. The team still had belief. The defense had belief. The special teams had belief. [Cooper] believed. He was open, I missed him a couple times, but it all came around in the end with the glory of God and with such amazing teammates and coaches. We were able to rally and get the win here in an awesome environment against a great team.\"Mendoza has been in favorable positions in the Heisman race effectively all season. This is not his first time as the betting favorite, but it could be his last. Such a campaign-defining statement this late in the season may be all it takes to launch Mendoza in front of Alabama's Ty Simpson, Ohio State's Julian Sayin and the other contenders for good.Mendoza already had the season-long numbers necessary to contend for the Heisman. Now, he has the signature moment. The junior entered the day with a Big Ten-leading 25 touchdowns on the year, a sparkling 72.3% completion rate, one of the most efficient stat lines in the nation and a perfect record.\nHe closed the afternoon with a string of plays that will endure in Indiana football lore for years to come.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Fernando Mendoza authored his Heisman moment on Saturday afternoon, marching the Hoosiers 80 yards down the field in 1:15 for the go-ahead touchdown to Omar Cooper Jr. to give Indiana a thrilling 27-24 win on the road at Penn State. Indiana found itself in unfamiliar territory on Saturday afternoon as Penn State erased a 13-point deficit to take a 24-20 lead on the No. 2 ranked team in the country late in the fourth quarter. After burning all three of its timeouts, Indiana was able to force a Penn State punt with two minutes to play to give Mendoza and the offense one more chance to avoid their first loss of the season.  A sack on first down was an inauspicious start, but then Mendoza began to string together some key completions. A seam shot moved them into Penn State territory and then he found the game's unlikely hero Charlie Becker for his ninth catch of the day to set up a goal-to-go situation. On third-and-goal, Mendoza threw one high to Cooper Jr. in the back of the end zone, who somehow got his left toe to tap inbounds as his right foot hovered over above the paint out of the end zone for the go-ahead and eventual winning score with 36 seconds left. \nPenn State moved the ball out to midfield, but could not push it into field goal range to try to force overtime, as Ethan Grunkemeyer's Hail Mary on the final play got knocked down. Mendoza finished the game with one of his worst statistical performances of the season, completing 19-of-30 passes for 218 yards, one touchdown and one interception. However, that one touchdown came on the backs of an incredible drive that, despite a rough game otherwise, will be remembered for a long time in Indiana football lore. Becker didn't catch the game-winning touchdown, but stepped up in a big way for injured star receiver Elijah Sarratt all game, totaling 117 yards to nearly match his career receiving yards in one game.The path to that final drive was a winding, meandering road that took a number of twists and turns before ultimately landing on an Indiana win. The Hoosiers got off to a sluggish start, but took a 20-7 lead midway through the third quarter thanks in large part to a pair of turnovers forced by their defense. \nDespite that advantage, the Indiana offense had never truly hit their stride and the Nittany Lions' defense was able to keep Penn State in the ball game. Thanks to that defensive performance, Penn State was able to trim the lead to 10 going into the fourth quarter when momentum swung the Nittany Lions' way. Early in the fourth quarter, Nick Singleton finally broke loose for a 59-yard run -- aided by an accidental block from the umpire in the secondary -- that set up a Penn State touchdown to cut the deficit to three.  \nOn the ensuing Indiana possession, Mendoza tried to hit a deep corner route on second down, but under-threw his man who got undercut by Penn State safety King Mack for an interception that gave the Nittany Lions the ball back in plus territory. \nThe Nittany Lions capitalized on that quick change of possession with another solid drive that Singleton capped off with an exclamation point, taking a screen pass and making three Indiana defenders miss on his way to the end zone for the go-ahead score. Unfortunately for Penn State, for as spectacular as their defense performed all afternoon, they could not get the final stop they needed to pull off the shocking upset. With the heartbreaking loss, Penn State falls to 3-6, and in a season full of disappointments, Saturday's may have been the most gut-wrenching of them all. For Indiana, the win keeps them undefeated at 10-0 and on a collision course with Ohio State for the Big Ten Championship later this year. They will certainly have some things to clean up on tape, as the defense got gashed on the ground late and the offense was not nearly as consistent as they'd like to be. Curt Cignetti will be happy to let his team learn those lessons in a win rather than a loss and keep all of the one-loss Big Ten teams behind them in the standings. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        LSU interim coach Frank Harris benched veteran quarterback Garrett Nussmeier in the third quarter of the Tigers' game at No. 4 Alabama on Saturday night. The hook came amid continued struggles for LSU's offense as the Tigers trailed 17-6 when backup Michael Van Buren Jr. entered.Nussmeier started 9 for 9, but his hot start fizzled amid more sloppy play from the LSU offensive line. Alabama frequently dropped seven or eight men in coverage against the Tigers, who have struggled to run the football all season. Even with a minimal pass rush, Bama was able to make Nussmeier uncomfortable.Harris, in his first game as the interim coach following Brian Kelly's firing, pulled Nussmeier after he took a 14-yard sack that backed LSU out of the red zone. A couple of three-and-outs preceded that big loss, and Harris was seen lighting into Nussmeier on the sideline after one unproductive series.Van Buren garnered significant playing time as a freshman at Mississippi State last season before transferring to LSU as a potential heir to Nussmeier. The idea of Van Buren supplanting Nussmeier for any reason aside from injury in the 2025 campaign would have been viewed as far-fetched entering the season. But Nussmeier has been underwhelming after throwing for 4,052 yards last season, and LSU has nothing to lose at this juncture.\nThe Tigers play home games against Arkansas and Western Kentucky this before traveling to No. 11 Oklahoma to close the regular season.Serious opportunity for Michael Van Buren Jr.Van Buren entered late in the fourth quarter of LSU's 49-25 loss at Texas A&M two weeks ago, but Saturday's circumstances were significantly different. Against the Aggies, the game was out of reach when Van Buren got the nod. On Saturday, the Tigers remained within striking distance with over a quarter left to play when they made the change. It was Van Buren's most substantive game action since he completed 10 of 12 passes in a blowout victory over LSU on Sept. 20.\nRedshirt question for Van BurenVan Buren can appear in up to four regular-season games before losing his chance to claim 2025 as a redshirt campaign. Saturday's appearance was his third. That creates an interesting dynamic for Van Buren and LSU's interim staff to navigate. If they think he's their best option for the final three games, that would require both parties to be willing to sacrifice the possibility of a redshirt. In this era, eligibility is money. However, potentially getting the chance to start the season's final three games would allow Van Buren to increase his value.Nussmeier's complicated legacyNussmeier would likely have been drafted last year if he'd opted to forego his final season of eligibility. His decision to return was celebrated by LSU fans and the staff. He was viewed as a Heisman Trophy contender and as a likely beneficiary of LSU's improved defense. While the Tigers have improved defensively in 2025, their offensive line and rushing attack have been nonexistent. \nThose glaring deficiencies left the fairly immobile Nussmeier with no choice but to play \"hero ball\" on many occasions. Consequently, he often appears unsettled and jittery in the pocket. On a few occasions against Alabama, he missed open receivers or didn't get his feet set before making throws. Such scenes have become the norm for Nussmeier in 2025.\n            ",

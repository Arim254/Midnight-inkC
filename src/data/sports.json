Italy has played a gracious host over the last two weeks of action with some incredible thrills and dramatic finishes. Now, there are still plenty of gold medals left to be handed out on the last weekend of action.It begins bright and early on Saturday with the Men's Ski Cross competition in Freestyle Skiing. Then, action heads over to the Mixed Team Aerials where the Americans look to add another medal to the robust tally. The American women have a chance to earn a medal inside the ice rink on Saturday when they take on Canada in the Bronze Medal Match in Curling. It would mark the first medal in the competition for the Americans and first for Canada since 2014 after entering the competition as the top ranked team.Plus, top American Speed Skater Jordan Stolz looks to add another medal to his incredible run on Saturday when he competes in the Mass Start. Stolz has already earned three medals in Italy, two gold and one silver. A medal of any kind in this final competition would make him the first American since Eric Heiden to win four medals in a single Winter Olympic cycle.\n\n        \n            \n                2026 Winter Olympics medal count: Keep track of Team USA's quest for gold in Italy\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nElsewhere, the gold medal game is set for the Men's Curling competition where Great Britain will take on Canada.

    "body": "\n        A rain-soaked Thursday in Los Angeles gave way to much improved conditions on a marathon Friday at Riviera Country Club. Thirty players had to complete their first round action starting at 7 a.m., while the second round got going 40 minutes later in an effort to get back on schedule going into the weekend. Among those who had to come back early were Xander Schauffele and Scottie Scheffler, who were moving in different directions on the leaderboard in one of the week's marquee groups. In calm, soft conditions early on Friday, Schauffele came out attacking to post a 3-under 68. After a short 38-minute turnaround from ending Round 1 to starting Round 2, he backed it up in the afternoon with a 6-under 65 to get into the top 5 at 9 under heading into the weekend. Scheffler, meanwhile, was trying to dig himself out of a hole he created for himself on Thursday when he went 5 over in his first 10 holes. He got two of those shots back in the morning to wrap up his first round, but needed a strong close on Friday afternoon just to make the cut. Even as a signature event, the Genesis has a cut for those outside the top-50 and ties -- and those within 10 shots of the lead. Scheffler birdied the par-5 17th to get to even par for the week, and then needed a 6-footer to save par on No. 18 just to make the weekend inside that top 50. \nThat extended his Tour-best made cut streak to 68 consecutive events, but required far more of a grind than he'd like in a limited field event. \nWhile Scheffler and Schauffele had to play 26 holes on Friday, Rory McIlroy was able to enjoy a normal turnaround after a strong 5-under 66 on Thursday in tough conditions. He did himself one better on Friday with a 6-under 65 to keep himself one shot off the lead heading into the weekend. McIlroy's improved ball-striking over the last year has been on display over the first two rounds, as he's third in the field in strokes gained on approach. His ability to flight shots and play with trajectories was critical in his first round in difficult conditions, and also allowed him to come home strong as winds picked up on Friday afternoon. What's been most impressive from McIlroy has been the consistency, especially after a wild week at Pebble Beach that saw him make a ton of birdies but also a lot of double bogeys (or worse). \n\"I said this at the start of the week, there's no Pacific Ocean to hit it into around this golf course, so that helps,\" McIlroy said after his second round. \"Even like I hit a wild tee shot on [No.] 15, 40 yards left of the fairway, but it's OK. It's a different type of golf this week, different setup. I still hit some loose shots, but the course setup is in a way that you can get away with it a little bit more. But I've hit it well, I've controlled my distance well for the most part, and I've holed some nice putts from sort of inside eight feet for pars when I've needed to.\" Being able to bomb it 333 yards off the tee also doesn't hurt -- nor does being fourth in strokes gained putting through two rounds. \nAs McIlroy has made his priorities known for his career at this point, a win at an iconic venue like Riviera Country Club -- in Tiger Woods' event, no less -- would undoubtedly carry some added weight for the future Hall of Famer. McIlroy noted last year how meaningful it was to win at a course like Pebble Beach, and adding another of California's legendary courses a year later would be a strong addition to his résumé. \nMcIlroy's strong efforts in the first two rounds put him in solo third at 11 under, just one shot back of the surprising tandem of Jacob Bridgeman and Marco Penge at the top of the leaderboard. The leaders1. Marco Penge, Jacob Bridgeman (-12)Penge was the best player on the DP World Tour last year not named Rory McIlroy, and after a tough start to his PGA Tour career with two missed cuts and a T64 last week, he's showing his full talents at Riviera. Penge is an exceptionally long hitter and leads the field in strokes gained off the tee this week, but he's been red-hot with the putter as well and has shown impressive touch with the irons for a player with his swing speeds. He won multiple times a year ago on the DP World Tour, but will now have to deal with some different nerves in the final group on the weekend of a signature event. Joining him will be Jacob Bridgeman, who has quietly made strong finishes on the PGA Tour a habit. Bridgeman has four top-20s to start his 2026 season and is coming off a 2025 season where he made the Tour Championship for the first time -- thanks to a pair of top-20s in the first two Playoff events. Bridgeman's calling card is his putter, and he's lapping the field on the greens to start this week with 7.4 strokes gained putting. The question for Bridgeman will be if his long game can hold up on the weekend and create enough opportunities to score -- as he couldn't quite keep up with the weekend scoring last week at Pebble Beach in a similar position. \nOther contenders3. Rory McIlroy (-11)T4. Xander Schauffele, Adam Scott (-9)T6. Max Greyserman, Min Woo Lee (-8)T8. Tommy Fleetwood, Matt Fitzpatrick, Wyndham Clark, Kurt Kitayama (-7)T12. Max Homa and three others (-6)T15. Jordan Spieth, Collin Morikawa and two others (-5)McIlroy and Schauffele will be tight in the rear view of Penge and Bridgeman on Saturday as they try to stay in position for their first PGA Tour victories, and that'll provide a significant test for their nerve. After an incredibly uneven week of play at Pebble Beach, McIlroy looks much more in control of his golf ball at Riviera -- with ball-striking reminiscent of what he used to win last year at Pebble. Schauffele, meanwhile, looks to be gaining confidence in his game by the day, and appeared quite comfortable shaping shots and playing aggressive in the soft conditions presented on Friday. When he's playing with that confidence, he's extremely dangerous and is looking to get back in the winner's circle for the first time since 2024. \nScott put together the round of the day with an 8-under 63 -- which included a closing bogey -- but as a former winner at Riviera, he has to be considered a threat on the weekend to become the second 45-year-old winner on the PGA Tour this season. Lurking further back in the pack are some others who have performed well to start 2026. Tommy Fleetwood continues to stack rounds in the 60s and moved into the top 10 with a 66 on Friday. Min Woo Lee came one shot away from a playoff last week and is carrying that positive momentum into his play this week. Matt Fitzpatrick has been sniffing around leaderboards since Phoenix and is once again heading into the weekend in contention. Then there's Max Homa, Jordan Spieth and last week's winner Collin Morikawa back at 5 under. Homa is a former winner here and is desperate for a strong finish on a course where he's performed well. Spieth continues to show signs of positive form, particularly with the putter, which provides optimism a breakout win could be coming. Morikawa, fresh off snapping his own winless streak at Pebble Beach, is playing solid golf again, but he (and Spieth) will need another super Saturday like he had a week ago if he's going to get in contention. \nNotable players to miss the cutSam Burns (+1)Maverick McNealy (+1)Russell Henley (+2)Chris Gotterup (+3)Justin Rose (+3)Keegan Bradley (+3)Jason Day (+5)Two of the five winners on the PGA Tour this season will miss the weekend at Riviera, as Gotterup and Rose struggled in L.A. It's also surprising to see Henley, McNealy and Burns fall off the pace and miss the cut after they've shown strong form to start the year as well. Updated 2026 Genesis Invitational odds, picksRory McIlroy (+185)Jacob Bridgeman (+380)Marco Penge (5-1)Xander Schauffele (15/2)Adam Scott (13-1)Tommy Fleetwood (17-1)Min Woo Lee (20-1)The way McIlroy is hitting his irons and with the expectation that the course firms up some as the week goes on, he is the rightful favorite here and I don't think his odds will get worse after Saturday's third round. I do think Schauffele presents some value at 15/2 with the way he's striking it as well, and of the group a bit further back, Lee's confidence right now means he's a threat to go low and get himself in real contention on Sunday. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        A middleweight title shot could be at stake for the winner of Saturday's UFC Fight Night main event in Houston. Former UFC champion Sean Strickland looks to bounce back against red-hot contender Anthony Hernandez.Strickland (29-7) has a new path to the middleweight title after Khamzat Chiamev became champion. Strickland was unlikely to get a third crack at Dricus du Plessis after two failed attempts. But Chimaev vs. Strickland is a fresh matchup. Between Strickland's No. 3 middleweight ranking and name value, it's feasible he could sneak ahead of the more deserving title challenger Nassourdine Imavov. Strickland has to beat Hernandez before those conversations can start. Oddsmakers think that's a tall task; Strickland disagrees.\"He has been steamrolling guys that I could f---ing write a clinic on,\"  Strickland told CBS Sports' Brian Campbell before the fight. \"So, no, he's not [on my level].\"Sign up for Paramount+ and Watch UFC Fight Night: Strickland vs. Hernandez for no additional fee -- every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with your subscription! Plans start as low as $8.99/month or $89.99/year!\nHernandez (15-2, 1 NC) is ready for his breakout moment after taking the long road through the division. \"Fluffy\" was won eight consecutive fights with six finishes. He's days away from potentially having the third longest middleweight win streak in UFC history. Beating Strickland would be the biggest accomplishment of his career, and puts him on par with Imavov as the most deserving middleweight title challenger. In fact, \"Fluffy\" would arguably have a better case than Imavov, boasting a longer win streak and just as many wins over former UFC champs.\"I think if you beat a former champ, that really makes a statement  because everybody is really good here,\" Hernandez said. \"Someone who has already done that  shit, you go out there and take him out?

Geoff Neal (No. 12) battles the tenacious Uros Medic, and Dan Ige (No. 14) tries to snap Melquizael Costa's five-fight win streak. Both veterans approach fight night renewed after overcoming personal health issues. For Neal, a five-year battle with substance abuse. For Ige, eye injuries before the Patricio Pitbull fight. \"I didn't have the energy for anything. I didn't prepare right. The weight cuts were terrible,\" Neal told CBS sports this week. \"There was a point before all that shit happen, I'd run for an hour at a seven mile pace. I'm knocking out eight point six miles in an hour. I'm trying to get back to the old me.\"\"I had trauma to my eyes,\" Ige said. \"My mindset going into that fight was, 'I don't know if I'll ever fight again.' I didn't know what I was dealing with. I didn't want a way out of the fight. I knew if I went to a doctor, they would tell me not to fight. That's my ego and my pride. I've battled with that for a long time. I probably should've addressed it, but I didn't... It's something I've always battled, but I'm getting better with it. I have a better relationship with myself and my thoughts. Things are night and day different.\" \nLet's take a look at the rest of the fight card with the latest odds from DraftKings before getting to a prediction and expert pick on the main event below.UFC Fight Night card, oddsFavoriteUnderdogWeightclassAnthony Hernandez -278Sean Strickland +225MiddleweightGeoff Neal -218Uros Medic +180WelterweightMelquizael Costa -218Dan Ige +180FeatherweightAnte Delija -142Sergehi Spivac +120HeavyweightJacobe Smith -310Josiah Harrell +250WelterweightMichel Pereira -155Zach Reese +130MiddleweightUFC Fight Night viewing informationDate: Feb. 21 | Start time: 8 p.m. ETLocation: Toyota Center -- HoustonStream: Paramount+ (subscribe now for as little as $8.99 per month)PredictionSean Strickland vs. Anthony Hernandez: I'm surprised with how far apart the odds are. Hernandez is taking a meaningful step up in competition against arguably the division's most frustrating defensive fighter. Strickland has elite experience and is uniquely equipped to limit his opponent's offense. Hernandez also has serious gaps in his defensive striking that Strickland can exploit. That being said, I'll side with the rising tide. Hernandez is a menace when he has grappling control and half guard on the ground. Strickland did a fantastic job stuffing du Plessis' takedowns and getting off the mat quickly. \"Fluffy\" lacks DDP's physicality, but makes up for it with tenacious chain wrestling and far better top control. Hernandez will have a tough time taking Strickland down. When he does, he'll make the most of it. Enough to win a close decision against a former champ who can certainly play spoiler. Pick: Hernandez via Split DecisionWho wins Strickland vs. Hernandez, and which UFC best bet of over +500 should you be all over? Visit SportsLine now to get detailed picks and analysis from the advanced model which showed a 6.1% ROI from over 500 fights from 2023-25, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        From teetering on the edge of going out of business during the early 2000s to preparing to kick off a league's 31st season with some of the best players in the world, Major League Soccer has come a long way since the first ball was kicked between the San Jose Clash and D.C. United in 1996. What started as a mandate to bring first division soccer to the United States as a stipulation in landing the 1994 World Cup has become one of the top soccer leagues in the world, with no signs of slowing down. Beginning with only 10 teams in 1996, there will be 30 teams in action this weekend, as the league has grown in unimaginable ways. From multimillion-dollar facilities to the presence on national teams and World Cup rosters, and of course, Lionel Messi, the fingerprints of MLS will be all over the 2026 World Cup, taking place in the United States, Canada, and Mexico this summer.MLS commissioner Don Garber summed this up well during his state of the league address in December, saying, \"We'd love to say that [the World Cup is] the rocket fuel, but this jet has been running for 30 years, and it's going to run for another 30.\"\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            In what will be the biggest World Cup in history, the 2026 tournament will expand to 48 teams for the first time, featuring at least four first-time qualifiers. It's expected to surpass records set by the 1994 World Cup, which is still the most attended in history. The 16 host cities are only the tip of the iceberg as well, with training facilities being picked out all around North America to ensure that national teams can have a true home away from home. But for any of this to happen, it goes back to the soccer builders in this country -- Lamar Hunt (of the Hunt family that owns the Kansas City Chiefs), Alan Rothenberg, Philip Anschutz, and so many more.Only a few may have expected things would advance so far when MLS started. However, for the first commissioner in league history, Doug Logan, this doesn't surprise him in the slightest.\n\"Yes, I did,\" Logan said when asked if he expected to see the best players in the world playing in MLS. \"People ask me that all the time. And the answer is yes. Part of the responsibility and the charge to the top leader in entities like this is to be able to have a vision of what could be and then tirelessly and ceaselessly keep the institution and the organization on that track. I realized where it was going to go. Not where it could go, but where it was going to go.\"I also realized after the first year or a year and a half that it was going to take longer and be more expensive to get there than my owners anticipated, And those were two realities for me, but if you're asking me, did I ever envision it getting to this, the answer is yes.\"NASL collapses, MLS risesEven with the league being founded in the wake of the North American Soccer League collapsing, that didn't stop investors like the Hunt family from buying into the potential that MLS could have. The NASL brought Pele to North America, and the New York Cosmos are still to this day one of the most recognizable American soccer brands, despite not having played a game since 2020 -- although that will change in March as they take the pitch to face Portland Hearts of Pine in New Jersey in USL League One.\nAt times, being able to keep that vision may have been easier said than done, especially during a period when Anschutz owned six of the league's 10 clubs, but the message remained the same. The people involved with the founding of MLS saw the potential in the league, and it was massive, but to come full circle with another World Cup on United States soil is where things are special in this moment of reflection. It may have taken longer than expected to get the World Cup back, but this is where the league can show how far it has come from the days of 10 clubs and franchises folding (Tampa Bay Mutiny, Miami Fusion, Chivas USA) and take advantage of the increased interest in soccer in America during it.MLS cities, facilities to have huge impactHost cities during the FIFA Club World Cup took notice when Boca Juniors fans descended on Miami, ES Tunis fans took over Times Square, and Brazilian fans marched from the Art Museum in Philadelphia, and it's an effect that will only be magnified during the World Cup. Kansas City will be central to this, with Algeria, Argentina, England, and the Netherlands all training in the Kansas City region.\"A World Cup puts the host country and all of the host cities on the global map. And of course, Kansas City is a big city, but from a global standpoint, it's probably not a very well-known city, with maybe the exception of its American football league team, which has garnered a little bit of global recognition over the last six or seven years,\" said Clark Hunt, chairman and CEO of the Hunt Sports Group, which owns the Chiefs and MLS club FC Dallas. \"But I really expect that Kansas City will become known globally because of its role in hosting World Cup games.\"\nMLS facilities have come a long way during this time, as the new Red Bull New York training facility in Whippany, N.J., that will open in March has a price tag higher than most early soccer-specific stadiums as over $120 million. That facility will host the Brazil national team during this summer's World Cup. Many of the league's newest facilities have garnered praise globally, with players noting the differences as well as teams and executives abroad taking note, but with national teams making the United States their home during the summer, it will be a true show of what these facilities have to offer. They were a large part of why the first expanded World Cup is taking place in the United States, and who knows, the facilities could lead to a few transfers into MLS following the World Cup. During a changing tide of American soccer, even those will be easier with the league looking to adopt a summer-to-spring schedule shift in 2027 to aling with the rest of the soccer world. It's one of many reasons why this World Cup feels like as much of an inflection point as it does a celebration of soccer, which was also the case in 1994, which brought the pressure of a new league, as there wasn't even a commissioner until November of 1995, before beginning play in 1996.\n\"I had less than three months before we were going to play in 10 cities. It was a whirlwind kickstart. We had an incredibly successful first year because everyone was kicking the tires and thinking that it's going to be like the World Cup, and leagues are not like the World Cup. Leagues are there to endure and stay and have a legacy,\" Logan said.And more than 30 years later, MLS has endured and is building its legacy brick by brick. This year won't have such a sprint compared to what '94 did, but with the coming shift, it's clear that the league is also entering a new era. New stadium projects will also see New York City FC's time playing at Yankee Stadium come to an end, and MLS has a massive opportunity in the wake of the World Cup.But the trajectory doesn't end there because it also impacts the youth level, which MLS EVP and Chief Communications Officer Dan Courtemanche notes.\n\"We're a league now that has elite player development and incredible facilities, and 43,000 kids playing in MLS NEXT. My son plays U15 MLS NEXT. He's with an elite club; he plays against the Red Bulls, New York City FC, the Revolution, and D.C. United, and I see the sophistication now at the youth level,\" Courtemanche said. \"This is my 34th season about to start in professional soccer but I'm only a few season in when it comes to viewing it as a soccer parent at a serious level, and my son, when he's done within 24 to 36 hours, he goes onto Taka.io, the software program, our partners, and he can see videos of all the key plays that he made, the pluses and the minuses and it helps him evaluate his game he works with his coach and it makes him better, and I gotta tell you, I didn't see that coming probably even five or 10 years ago that 43,000 kids have access to that.\"With players like Alex Freeman and Obed Vargas making the jump to top level European leagues this year and others like Cavan Sullivan set to follow in the future, the impact of MLS Next on youth soccer can't be understated as well as the impact that the United Soccer League has in offering more pathways and opportunities for people to play and learn about soccer who may not have previously been able to.Capitalizing on the World Cup waveWhile there's optimism about what MLS can gain from the World Cup, it's critical to catch soccer fans soon after the World Cup. It's easier to do when the league can now say, \"Look at these players who were at the World Cup, you can keep watching them in MLS,\" which isn't something that could've been said to this degree in previous World Cups outside of members of North American national teams. Truth be told, 2022 was a banner year for MLS at the World Cup, and the 2026 edition is set to be even bigger. Messi joined MLS in the following summer, and he won the Ballon d'Or as a member of Inter Miami for his production in 2022.\nLionel Messi's 2023 Ballon d'Or was awarded to him as a member of Inter Miami. \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            \"During the last two years, in total attendance, we were the second-highest attended league in the world behind the Premier League. And I wouldn't have imagined that either,\" Courtemanche said. \"So look, the world's game is here. It's continuing. And even during the World Cup in 2022, we had 37 players from Major League Soccer competing for various national teams. That was more than any other league in the Western Hemisphere.\"But how that conversion is done is critical. Just because someone watches the World Cup doesn't mean that they'll automatically decide that MLS is the league for them, but the league will need to ensure that it capitalizes on those people sampling soccer to turn them into domestic fans.\"One of the things that has happened after every World Cup in recent times is that the domestic league that plays in the host country receives a big boost,\" Hunt said. \"If you look at the attendance numbers, the TV viewership, in the year or two after a country hosts the World Cup, those numbers grow significantly. And I think in a country like the United States, where we still have an opportunity to create a lot of new soccer fans, I think that'll be particularly pronounced. And so MLS will have a real opportunity to benefit both in terms of fans attending games and watching the league on TV. So I think that's very exciting for Major League Soccer and something that we need to make sure we capitalize on.\"\nMLS isn't a league that has been around for the vast majority of Americans' lives like some other places that have hosted World Cups, but with a fandom that tends to a younger demographic, the league can set itself up well for the next 30-plus years, although, hopefully, it won't take that long for the World Cup to return to America. Soccer in America has come a long way since the last World Cup, and it could be unrecognizable, taking another look back in the future, in a good way, considering the successes that have happened since the MLS' founding. American players have taken massive steps over the last several years, and MLS has as well. They are counting on their growth to continue, be further cultivated by the World Cup, and for the next set of years to bring exponential growth initial founders could have only dreamed of.\n            ",

Mayweather announced that he will compete professionally in boxing after an exhibition fight with Mike Tyson in the spring.Mayweather will end his professional boxing retirement nine years after riding off into the sunset with a perfect 50-0 record. On Friday, Mayweather announced his plans to box professionally again after a planned exhibition bout with legendary heavyweight champion Tyson. Mayweather signed an exclusive deal with CSI Sports/FIGHT SPORTS for his upcoming exhibition and professional fights.\"I still have what it takes to set more  records in the sport of boxing,\" Mayweather said in a press release. \"From my upcoming Mike Tyson event to my  next professional fight afterwards, no one will generate a bigger  gate, have a larger global  broadcast audience, and generate more money with each event than my  events.\"CSI Sports said they'd reveal details about event dates, broadcast information and the professional opponent for Mayweather's sanctioned return in the coming weeks. \nLast year, Mayweather and Tyson confirmed plans for an exhibition fight between them. The Ring recently reported the fight would take place on April 25 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; however, CSI Sports has not announced the date, location, or ruleset. Mayweather and Tyson are a combined 107 years old. Mayweather weighed in at 160.7 pounds for his last exhibition fight with John Gotti III. Tyson weighed 228.4 pounds for his exhibition bout with Jake Paul.Mayweather (50-0) retired from pro boxing after defeating former  two-division UFC champion Conor McGregor in 2017. Mayweather has taken  eight exhibition boxing bouts in the time since, most notably a first-round TKO against generational kickboxer Tenshin  Nasukawa and an eight-round affair in a non-scored bout with WWE superstar  Logan Paul. \nTyson (50-7, 2 NC) has boxed three times since retiring in 2004. Two of those were exhibitions: a non-scored bout with Corey Sanders in 2006 and a draw against Roy Jones Jr. in 2020. Last year, Tyson boxed in his first professional fight in two decades against Paul. Tyson lost a lifeless decision against Paul, 30 years his junior. The critically panned fight was a huge commercial success for Netflix.\n            \n",

    "body": "\n        No. 8 Kansas controls its own destiny in a Big 12 Championship race that is shaping up to be an all-timer. The Jayhawks are 10-3 in conference play, just one game behind Arizona and Houston. Kansas gets to play both of the Big 12's top dawgs in the next eight days, but it can't afford to have any other hiccups starting Saturday against a Cincinnati club that has underwhelmed this year (14-12, 6-7 in Big 12 play) but has shown an ability to play up and beat an Iowa State team that is trending to be a No. 2 seed. Of course, Darryn Peterson's status remains the biggest story. He scored 23 brilliant points in just 19 minutes against Oklahoma State before asking out with another cramping episode. \"I didn't anticipate that tonight at all,\" Kansas coach Bill Self told reporters. \"I thought he was good to go, but obviously, we only got 18 minutes. That's disappointing 'cause he could have had a really good night.\" \n        \n            \n                Kansas' Bill Self gets candid on Darryn Peterson 'checking out': What's right, what's 'false', what's next\n                \n                    Isaac Trotter                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe saga continues with no end in sight. Let's dive into the X's and O's of this Big 12 tilt.   Kansas vs. Cincinnati: Need to know Who gets the Baba Miller assignment? Miller is having the best season of his career, even amidst a miserable 3-point shooting slump. The 6-foot-11 Cincinnati forward is firmly a post-hype sleeper who has blossomed into one of the best mismatch forwards in the Big 12. But Kansas has plenty of options. Flory Bidunga has been Kansas' problem-solver defensively this season. Against BYU, he pivoted to guarding dynamic wing AJ Dybantsa. Against Texas Tech, he got the JT Toppin assignment. But Cincinnati is a bit of a tougher matchup. Do you put Bidunga on 7-foot big man Moustapha Thiam and let freshman Bryson Tiller take a turn on Miller? Tiller has been a pleasant surprise for KU this year and has the frame and athleticism to handle Miller. Or do you let Bidunga, the frontrunner for Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year, try to slow down Miller and trust Tiller to handle the Thiam assignment?  \nThe transition seesaw: When these two defenses get set, they can both be pretty nasty. That raises the stakes of each transition possession. You just have to take advantage because there won't be a ton of clean looks in the halfcourt.  Role players in the spotlight: Kansas needs to get Tre White humming again. The well-traveled wing has been so good for the Jayhawks, but he's lost a bit of his steam lately. Part of that could be the after-effects from dealing with a painful root canal procedure. This could be a get-right spot for White. On paper, he has a tasty individual matchup with Cincinnati's Jalen Celestine, who is mainly on the floor to make 3-pointers, not strap up defensively. A good day for White could tilt the scales here. On the other hand, Cincinnati guard Sencire Harris is one of the best point-of-attack defenders in the sport. When he's on the floor, he will get right up into Melvin Council Jr. or Darryn Peterson. Kansas can't let Harris change the game with his energy. He is a total dawg who ain't afraid of anybody.  Where to watch Kansas vs. Cincinnati live Date: Saturday, Feb. 21| Time: 1 p.m. ET Location: Allen Fieldhouse -- Lawrence, Kansas TV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App Streaming on Paramount+ Premium    Kansas vs. Cincinnati prediction, pick \nKansas has plenty of schematic edges in this one, but Cincinnati could be a touch undervalued here in a game that could be a low-possession affair between two defenses that give each other problems. The double-big lineup of Miller and Thiam is mobile enough to hang with Bidunga and Tiller, and Cincinnati's guards won't give up straight-line drives to Council. Cincinnati will unquestionably flood the paint and force Kansas' low-volume 3-point shooters to bomb away over the top. That's the right strategy against everyone on this Kansas roster, except for Peterson. There's also the lookahead spot to Kansas' enormous Big Monday tilt with No. 4 Houston, and if Peterson misses a good chunk of the second half again — which feels inevitable — the door is open for a backdoor cover. Kansas wins but Cincinnati stays inside this number.

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 Serie A season is in full swing in Italy. Napoli started the campaign as defending champions after winning the 2024-25 title, their fourth Scudetto ever on the last matchday of the season. Inter and AC Milan will compete with the team coached by Antonio Conte to win the Serie A title, while other teams such as AS Roma, Atalanta, Juventus, Bologna and Como are all in contention for a spot in next season's European tournaments. This week's Serie A slate features some interesting matchups, such as the game between Como and Juventus on Saturday in Turin, but it is injury news that is all the talk heading into the weekend. Here's what to know:Lautaro Martinez injuredInter will have to react after the disappointing 3-1 defeat against Bodo/Glimt in the Champions League as the Nerazzurri are currently leading the Serie A standings with a seven-point margin on AC Milan, which drew 1-1 at San Siro against Como on Wednesday. Cristian Chivu's side will have to deal with the injury of Lautaro Martinez, who was replaced in the second half of the Champions League first leg playoffs. The Argentinian captain underwent a medical examinations that \"revealed a strain to the soleus muscle in his left calf,\" and the player will be reevaluated in the coming weeks, but he's expected to miss at least two weeks of action and will likely miss the key fixture against AC Milan on March 8. This is why the upcoming two Serie A games and the Champions League return leg against Bodo/Glimt will be even more important for Chivu and his team, as the Nerazzurri will need to continue performing even without their best striker on the roster. Players such as Marcus Thuram, Yann Bonny and the young Italian talent Francesco Pio Esposito will be called to make the difference against Lecce on Saturday, the first match Lautaro will definitely miss. How to watch Lecce vs. Inter, oddsDate: Saturday, Feb. 21 | Time: 12 p.m. ETLocation: Stadio Via del Mare -- Lecce Live stream: Paramount+Odds: Lecce +669; Draw +318; Inter -223How to watch Serie A Matchday 26All times U.S./Eastern. \nFriday, Feb. 20Sassuolo vs. Hellas Verona, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)Saturday, Feb. 21Juventus vs. Como, 9 a.m. (Paramount+)Lecce vs. Inter, 12 p.m. (Paramount+)Cagliari vs. Lazio, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)Sunday, Feb. 22Genoa vs. Torino, 6:30 a.m. (Paramount+)Atalanta vs. Napoli, 9 a.m. (Paramount+)AC Milan vs. Parma, 12 p.m. (Paramount+)AS Roma vs. Cremonese, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)\nMonday, Feb. 23Fiorentina vs. Pisa, 12 p.m. (Paramount+)Udinese vs. Bologna, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 college football season is still more than six months away, and spring practice hasn't even started. Still, betting lines are already available for eight early-season matchups.With position battles unresolved, depth charts incomplete and inevitable injuries still to come, it's impossible to get a firm read on any team. That hasn't stopped oddsmakers from posting marquee lines -- or bettors from hunting early edges on numbers that could shift dramatically before kickoff.Even for fans who (probably wisely) aren't interested in wagering in February on games scheduled for August and September, the lines offer a snapshot of how oddsmakers currently value each team. There's the straightforward head-to-head comparison -- someone has to be the favorite and someone the underdog.Several of the early matchups are also rematches from last season. Comparing those opening lines to how the 2025 editions played out can reveal whether oddsmakers believe a team improved or regressed during the offseason amid roster turnover.\nAs of now there are eight games with look-ahead lines available at FanDuel Sportsbook, and we wanted to take a quick look at each and what the lines say about those 16 teams. Week 0NC State vs. VirginiaLine: Virgnia -3.5Over/under: 54.5 The first college football game played in Brazil will feature a classic ACC rivalry. Last season, NC State won a wild matchup after Virginia jumped out early, only to watch the Wolfpack surge ahead with a 21-point third quarter.This year, the Cavaliers are 3.5-point favorites on a neutral field -- a nod to the belief in what Beau Pribula could bring to the offense as he replaces Chandler Morris at quarterback, and perhaps a sign of greater confidence in Virginia's defense than NC State's.\nThe Wolfpack will again be led by talented quarterback C.J. Bailey, but the central question is whether they can take a step defensively after finishing 82nd nationally in scoring defense last season.North Carolina at TCULine: TCU -7.5Over/under: 50.5 Oddsmakers don't seem too bullish on Year 2 of the Chapel Bill experiment. After the Tar Heels got boatraced at home by the Horned Frogs in the opener last year, TCU opens as more than a touchdown favorite in Fort Worth for the 2026 matchup. Both teams will be breaking in new quarterbacks. TCU brought in Harvard's Jaden Craig, while UNC nabbed former Wisconsin and Maryland QB Billy Edwards. UNC showed some signs of improvement towards the end of last year after their disastrous start, but it seems oddsmakers are going to need to see some proof before they buy in on a major turnaround in 2026 under Bill Belichick. \nWeek 1Baylor vs. Auburn Line: Auburn -7.5Over/under: 58.5Auburn earned a 38-24 road win in this matchup last season -- a result that foreshadowed Baylor's struggles but proved something of a mirage for a Tigers team that had trouble scoring for much of the year.Both teams will look different when they meet in Atlanta to open the 2026 season, but oddsmakers are clearly bullish on Auburn's trajectory in Year 1 under Alex Golesh on the Plains. Golesh brought several players with him from a strong USF squad, most notably quarterback Byrum Brown, and the expectation is that Auburn's offense will be far more explosive.Baylor counters with a high-profile transfer of its own in former Florida quarterback DJ Lagway, hoping he can help reverse course after a dismal 2025 campaign. If nothing else, oddsmakers anticipate points with new quarterbacks on both sides. Still, the Tigers being a sizable favorite on a neutral field stands out.\nClemson at LSU (-11.5, 51.5)Line: LSU -11.5Over/under: 51.5This was billed as one of the games of the year in 2025, but LSU's 17-10 win at Clemson became the high point of the Tigers' season -- and the beginning of a disastrous campaign for Clemson.Now the spotlight shifts to Baton Rouge, where Lane Kiffin has retooled LSU's roster with the nation's No. 1 transfer portal class, headlined by former Arizona State quarterback Sam Leavitt. Oddsmakers appear to be buying into the idea that Kiffin will open up the offense and quickly turn the Tigers into a contender.Dabo Swinney, meanwhile, enters 2026 on the hot seat. If this matchup follows the script set by the early line, the pressure surrounding the longtime Clemson coach is only likely to intensify.\n11/5: UCLA at Cal (-5.5, 53.5)Line: 5.5 Over/under: 53.5Both UCLA and Cal have the rare combination of new head coaches for 2026 and returning starting quarterbacks. Cal is an early 5.5-point home favorite, which suggests slightly more belief in the Golden Bears' roster in Tosh Lupoi's first season back in Berkeley compared to UCLA under Bob Chesney in Los Angeles.The biggest reason for optimism at Cal is Lupoi's ability to keep quarterback Jaron-Keawe Sagapolutele on the roster after a freshman year that showed considerable upside. UCLA, meanwhile, will have Nico Iamaleava back following an up-and-down season and hopes a new staff can unlock his full potential.Both programs are looking for a jolt, and this game in Berkeley offers an early opportunity to generate some much-needed excitement.\nWisconsin vs. Notre Dame (Sunday)Line: Notre Dame -16.5Over/under: 46.5This game will be played at Lambeau Field and while Wisconsin has hopes of building off a solid close to 2025, they are massive underdogs against a Notre Dame team projected to be a national title contender. C.J. Carr has a year of experience under his belt at quarterback and the Irish are expected to have a stout defense once again under Marcus Freeman. Notre Dame will also spend all year hammering home the message of starting fast after they put themselves in a hole early last year that kept them out of the Playoff. The Badgers hope to climb out of the Big Ten's cellar in 2026 after pledging a big investment into Luke Fickell's program, and they put that to use in the transfer portal with 33 signings, highlighted by Old Dominion QB Colton Joseph. No one expects them to win this game, but if they're competitive and keep this solidly inside this early number, it would breed some optimism in Madison. Week 2Ohio State at Texas Line: Texas -2.5Over/under: 47.5A year ago in the Horseshoe, Ohio State won 14-7 as a 1.5-point favorite. This time, oddsmakers give Arch Manning and Texas a slight edge with the game in Austin, but the line again suggests what amounts to a coin flip.Both teams are expected to contend for a national title, though fans will hope for more fireworks after last season's defensive struggle. It should help that Manning and his counterpart, Julian Sayin, will have a full season as starters, potentially allowing both staffs to open up the playbook.\nDespite the marquee quarterbacks, oddsmakers are not projecting a full-blown shootout with two strong defensive programs involved. Ohio State loses significant defensive talent to the NFL this offseason, making this an early test of how quickly a new unit can come together. History -- and recent recruiting and transfer rankings -- suggest the Buckeyes won't take long to reload.Oklahoma at MichiganLine: Michigan -1.5Over/under: 45.5A year ago, the Sooners were 4.5-point home favorites against the Wolverines and validated that line with a 24-13 win that helped propel Oklahoma to the College Football Playoff.Michigan enters this matchup with a new coach in Kyle Whittingham -- who arrives from Utah. With Bryce Underwood back for his sophomore season, the Wolverines carry lofty expectations as a potential CFP contender in 2026.\nThe total of 45.5 is no surprise given the defensive pedigrees of both coaches and could dip even lower as kickoff approaches. For Oklahoma, the question is whether a healthy John Mateer can make the offense more dynamic than it was late in 2025, or if the Sooners will again need to lean on a dominant defense.Oddsmakers appear to trust Whittingham's ability to elevate Michigan, and lingering concerns about Oklahoma's offense have made the Wolverines a slight favorite in the Big House.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        With the fantasy basketball stretch run underway, working the waiver wire can be the difference between a playoff push and a missed opportunity. Injuries, trades, and tanking teams are opening up new roles across the league, creating short-term streaming value and potential rest-of-season risers. Players like Jay Huff and Day'Ron Sharpe are seeing increased minutes due to shifting frontcourt situations, while emerging options such as Devin Carter and Tristan Vukcevic offer category-specific upside. Meanwhile, Precious Achiuwa's expanded workload could quietly translate into steady production. Here are the top waiver wire targets to consider as schedules, roles, and rotations begin to stabilize.Jay Huff, Pacers (43% rostered)It's been an up-and-down season for Huff. Efficiency and role haven't been consistent. But there appears to be a trend upward lately, which has upside to continue following the Pacers trading away competition at center in Isaiah Jackson.Huff has played at least 21 minutes in six straight games, averaging 11.3 points and 1.2 3s on 47/26/100 shooting, five rebounds, 1.8 assists, 1.7 blocks, and 1.2 steals (27.9 fantasy points). He might not make sense for fantasy managers in standard leagues who don't need 3s or blocks, but he at least needs to be on the streaming radar in all leagues. In deep formats, I don't think he should be on the wire given what we've seen lately.Day'Ron Sharpe, Nets (33% rostered)Sharpe has started the past two games with Nic Claxton out, providing mixed results due to a competitive game against the Pacers and a blowout loss to the Cavaliers. Still, he was able to total 23 points, 17 rebounds, eight assists, two steals, and two blocks in those 51 minutes.\nSimilar to Huff, Sharpe doesn't qualify as a must-roster player for every team in a standard league. But he will fit the bill for someone who needs rebounds at minimum, and who could also use some extra assists and steals. Over Sharpe's past eight games, he's averaging 11.9 points, nine rebounds, 2.3 assists, and one steal (27.9 fantasy points) in 20.8 minutes. With the Nets playing four games next week, he needs to at least be on streaming radars.Devin Carter, Kings (12% rostered)The Kings are deep in the tank, partially due to legitimate injuries. That has vaulted a few players into fantasy relevance, including Carter. The 23-year-old guard has stepped into a bigger role across the past six games, averaging 14 points on 39.5 percent from the field, 4.5 rebounds, 4.2 assists, and 1.2 steals (28.7 fantasy points) in 26.8 minutes.There's no reason to think Carter won't keep seeing this kind of role. And it's possible there's an expanded role incoming if Russell Westbrook or Malik Monk sit games out. The Kings drafted Carter No. 13 overall in 2024, so the assumption should be they will use this as an opportunity to see what they have in him. Fantasy managers should act accordingly, especially if you need steals and assists.\nTristan Vukcevic, Wizards (12% rostered)Starting center Alex Sarr is expected to be sidelined for at least another week, which should afford Vukcevic continued chances for extended run. He's started four games this season, including Thursday against the Pacers, averaging 12 points and 1.3 3s on 46/28/60 shooting, 4.8 rebounds, 1.3 assists, 1.8 steals, and one block (27.1 fantasy points) in 20.3 minutes when getting the nod.It's hard to trust Vukcevic as a rest-of-season add given that he's on a two-way contract and Sarr could be back sooner than later. Still, he's a strong per-minute player that hardly needs 20 minutes to be worth a short-term pickup. Fantasy managers in all leagues should at least have him on their watchlist, and I wouldn't let him be available right now in deep formats.Precious Achiuwa, Kings (5% rostered)With Domantas Sabonis done for the year and Dylan Cardwell out for a month, Sacramento's frontcourt is in bad shape. Most managers have already picked up Maxime Raynaud, who is a must-roster player. But Precious Achiuwa saw massive run in Thursday's loss to the Magic. In 34 minutes, he produced 14 points, 10 rebounds, one assist, four steals, and two blocks.\nAchiuwa's value has fluctuated for much of the year, but it could stabilize now, given the situation in Sacramento. When Achiuwa plays more than his season average of 20.5 minutes, he averages 11 points, 7.5 rebounds, 1.3 assists, and 1.2 steals (26.9 fantasy points). That's good enough to be worth rostering for some standard league managers. At the very least, he should be scooped up in deep formats to see how this plays out.\n            ",

On the first Friday of this month, we got St. John's over UConn. Last Friday, it was Wisconsin over Michigan State. This Friday, it's a Big Ten showdown between in-state rivals that have seen better days.This Friday, it's Indiana at Purdue.Both are coming off of double-digit losses -- but, if anything, that just makes the game even bigger because it means the loser of this one will enter next week trying to avoid a three-game losing streak. In other words, it's a huge game for both. But I'd argue it's bigger for Purdue than Indiana, if only because if the Boilermakers lose they'll A) take their first Q2 loss of the season, and B) suffer their fourth loss inside Mackey Arena in the same season for the first time since 2013-2014.Truth is, Indiana is about where it was supposed to be. The Hoosiers started 38th at KenPom.com and are currently 37th at KenPom.com. But Purdue was the preseason No.1 in the Associated Press Top 25 poll, meaning the Boilermakers are not supposed to be coming off of a double-digit loss at home -- but this is the second time they're doing it this season.Tip is scheduled for 8 pm ET.You can watch it on Fox.\nPurdue is listed as an 11.5-point favorite. Among the storylines going in is Braden Smith's pursuit of the NCAA's all-time assist record. He currently has 986 in his career. That ranks fifth all-time -- one spot ahead of former East Tennessee State star Keith \"Mister\" Jennigs, one spot below former LIU Brooklyn standout Jason Brickman.\n        \n            \n                Bracketology Bubble Watch: Miami (Ohio) still undefeated; TCU vs. West Virginia is crucial for both teams\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTop 25 And 1 rankings\n        Biggest Movers\n    RkTeams\n                    ChgRcrd\n                                1\n                            \n                                    Michigan\n                                \n                            Elliott Cadeau finished with 17 points and seven assists in Tuesday's 91-80 win at Purdue.

Brady, widely regarded as the best NFL quarterback of all time, said he loved WWE but called it \"very cute.\" Paul, a part-time WWE superstar, argued that Brady was underestimating the athleticism required of pro wrestlers. Several high-profile WWE superstars and personalities reacted to Brady's statement when approached by Sports Illustrated. Some WWE talent brushed it off, while others went for Brady's throat.\"What's Tom Brady done? He's thrown a football across a field that was   caught by [Rob] Gronkowski,\" Hall of Famer Paul Heyman said. \"Gronkowski deserves the credit. [Bill] Belichick and his   girlfriend deserve the credit. But Tom Brady [gestures no].\"World heavyweight champion CM Punk had a more playful response than his longtime mentor and friend.\n\"What's wrong with cute?\" Punk said, looking directly into the camera. \"I'm cute, Tom.\" Former two-time NXT champion Oba Femi, an outdoor first-team All-USA selection with multiple shot put titles, challenged Brady to put himself through the rigorous pro wrestling training process. Undisputed WWE champion Drew McIntyre brushed off Brady's comments. He chalked up Brady's statement to a lack of understanding.\n\"I don't get annoyed,\" McIntyre said. \"It just comes from a place of ignorance.\"\n            \n",

    "body": "\n        We're just a few weeks removed from the 2025 season coming to a close. While the Seattle Seahawks are still basking in the glory of hoisting the Lombardi Trophy after winning Super Bowl LX, the rest of the NFL is preparing to knock them off the pedestal or at least become more competitive in 2026. For some organizations, that includes overhauling or continuing the search for their franchise quarterback, while others are simply building around the signal-caller they have. Then, there's another group. It's the collection of teams that aren't quite thrilled with the quarterback they have in place, but are not totally at the stage of hitting the eject button either. That uneasy middle ground regarding the most important position in the sport is hardly the place any team wants to be, but it's the reality for a handful entering 2026. That creates a ton of pressure on those quarterbacks to put everyone's concerns to rest with a strong season, thus planting their flag as a franchise centerpiece. If not, some hard decisions will then need to be made.Below, we'll highlight five quarterbacks who are currently on the hot seat, albeit with the start of the 2026 campaign still months away.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. C.J. Stroud\nA decision on Stroud's future in Houston could come as early as this offseason, as the former No. 2 overall pick is now extension eligible. At the very least, the Texans will almost certainly pick up his fifth-year option, but Stroud hasn't instilled much confidence in recent seasons. The Ohio State product burst onto the scene with one of the better rookie seasons in recent memory in 2023, but he hasn't followed that up with equal or ascending production. In fact, he's regressed on a couple of fronts. \nC.J. Stroud's career as a starter20232024-2025Passing yards per game273.9218.3TD-INT23-539-20Passer rating100.889.6Over the last two seasons, Stroud's completion percentage is worse than Kirk Cousins over that stretch, his yards per attempt are below Geno Smith's, and his passer rating is below Kyler Murray's. Stroud should be heads and shoulders above those quarterbacks as he establishes himself as one of the brightest young players at the position. Instead, he's going in the other direction. And let's not forget the jarring four-interception game in the divisional round against New England. This is hardly the trajectory a team wants to see when considering making him one of the highest-paid quarterbacks in the league on a contract that'll likely pay him somewhere in the range of $55 million per season. It also makes one wonder if Houston will hold off on giving Stroud any sort of extension this offseason and merely pick up the fifth-year option. If that happens, Stroud will be put further under the microscope in 2026 with the Texans determining if he's truly worth giving a mammoth contract to. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Bryce Young\nYoung is in a somewhat similar position to Stroud as the Panthers are now having to consider giving him the fifth-year option (which they are expected to do), along with potentially inking him to an extension. It's been a topsy-turvy career for Young thus far after being the No. 1 overall pick in 2023. The Alabama product was benched momentarily, but he did just enjoy a solid bounce-back season in 2025. He notched career highs in passing touchdowns, completion percentage, and passing yards per game, while helping Carolina to an NFC South championship. Young also played well in his playoff debut, albeit in a losing effort to the Rams. With that in mind, there should be optimism surrounding Young going into 2026, but he hasn't firmly established himself just yet. As encouraging as 2025 was, Young still completed just 63.6% of his passes and averaged 188.2 passing yards per game for an 87.8 passer rating. That's good, but not exactly great production. If he plateaus or regresses next season, the Panthers will still have major questions surrounding him as their long-term option.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Michael Penix Jr.\nPenix may be given the benefit of the doubt in 2026 because he's recovering from a torn ACL, but the former Washington quarterback hasn't impressed since Atlanta selected him with the eighth overall pick in 2024. He's 4-8 as the starter (3-6 in 2025), and is completing less than 60% of his passes with a mere 85.8 passer rating for his career. Despite having some of the top weaponry in the league in running back Bijan Robinson and wideout Drake London, the Falcons offense under Penix has looked clunky. With a new regime coming aboard with Matt Ryan being hired as the President of Football, Ian Cunningham being added as GM, and Kevin Stefanski installed as head coach, Penix could be on shaky ground. After all, none of those figures drafted him, so they are not as invested in him as the previous decision-makers were. There are also durability questions as he's dealt with several serious injuries dating back to college. YearInjuryGames missed2018Right torn ACL42019Right fractured collarbone42020Right torn ACL32021Left A/C joint separation72025Left torn ACL8When you factor in that injury history alongside the uninspiring play when he has been on the field, it wouldn't be surprising to see the Falcons bring in some competition this offseason, whether that's keeping Kirk Cousins in-house or adding another QB into the mix. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. J.J. McCarthy\nThe Vikings bungled their quarterback situation, and it may have cost them their Super Bowl window. They decided to ride with McCarthy and allow Sam Darnold to depart in free agency last offseason after a 14-3 regular season in 2024. Darnold went on to win a Super Bowl with Seattle, while McCarthy has largely struggled as the starter. That decision was seemingly a driving force in Minnesota firing GM Kwesi Adofo-Mensah. A new GM won't have the same investment in McCarthy as Adofo-Mensah did, so the former first-round pick is truly at a crossroads in 2026. In fact, it wouldn't be surprising if the Vikings, under interim GM Rob Brzezinski, bring in some competition this offseason. Depending on who comes aboard (Mac Jones, Tua Tagovailoa, etc.), McCarthy's job could vanish before we even get to Week 1. In 2025, McCarthy was 6-4 as the starter, completed just 57.6% of his passes, and had more interceptions (12) than touchdowns (11). J.J.

Is that the tide turning in a positive direction? That remains to be seen, but the Vikings aren't exactly acting like it is as they seem open to an upgrade if one is realistically available to them. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Shedeur Sanders\nSanders ended the 2025 season as Cleveland's starting quarterback, but he has hardly established himself as the set-and-forget figure under center for the organization. Despite the fanfare, the Colorado quarterback wasn't particularly impressive when given his opportunity. In most categories, he was either at or near the bottom of the league after making his NFL debut.\nSanders since Week 11 debutStatsNFL rankCompletion percentage57%Second worstINT10WorstTD-INT8-10Second worstPasser rating68.1Second worstWith Todd Monken now hired as head coach, Sanders' status as QB1 for 2026 is clouded. When asked about it during his introductory press conference, Monken told reporters that it's \"still to be determined.\" There's no clear-cut prospect Cleveland could take with the No. 6 overall pick at the 2026 NFL Draft, but the team could (and likely will) look to bring in a veteran to compete for the starting job this offseason. That sets up Sanders to be fighting for his job the moment training camp begins later this summer. \n            ",

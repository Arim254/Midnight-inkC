    "body": "\nFour matches is not much to go on, especially when assessing a Real Madrid coach. Imperfect versions of this team are supposed to breeze through many of their domestic challenges and usually do, something that is not unique to Alvaro Arbeloa two weeks after assuming the helm. The surprise defeat to second division Albacete Balompie in the Copa del Rey notwithstanding, Arbeloa has followed that up with three successive wins, wins they likely would have collected if Xabi Alonso was still in charge. One thing is clear, though – if Alonso had to be convinced to find a place for both Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Junior on the field, Arbeloa understood the task from the start.The power balance has always been the club's defining feature, for better or for worse, and remains the theme of the season even as the team grapples with life after Alonso's surprise ouster earlier this month. Arbeloa has obviously been tasked with finding some tactical harmony with Vinicius and Mbappe, starting the pair in each match since the Copa del Rey defeat. The results have been favorable – they have outscored the opponents 12 to four in those three games and generate 2.4 expected goals per game, identical to their season average thus far. Mbappe has scored five goals in each of those games while Vinicius notched a goal and two assists in last week's victory over Monaco in the UEFA Champions League. Everything is trending in the right direction, at least for the time being.\"I don't think it's changed that much, every coach has his own way of training, but maybe something is clicking better now,\" Thibaut Courtois said after a win over Villarreal over the weekend, signaling what the results indicate.How to watch Benfica vs. Real Madrid, oddsDate: Wednesday, Jan. 28 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Estadio da Luz -- Lisbon, PortugalLive stream: Paramount+Odds: Benfica +300; Draw +310; Real Madrid -125One question continues to loom large over Los Blancos this season, though -- is this strategy going to work against more challenging opponents, and when might we finally get those answers?The answers are unlikely to come on Wednesday at Benfica, even if the Portuguese side really need the points. The team currently sit in 29th place, two points outside the top 24 and in need of a win to even have a shot at reaching the knockout phase playoffs. Jose Mourinho's hire, which came after a shock defeat to Qarabag on Matchday 1, has not offered the jolt the team's higher-ups may have hoped for – they are amongst the Champions League's worst attacking teams with just six goals from 9.02 expected goals in seven games, their middle-of-the-pack defensive operation so far, not enough to rescue them from probable elimination. An imbalanced Real Madrid are likely able to handle this test, much as they did against an inferior Monaco side in a 6-1 drubbing on Matchday 7.Instead, some will choose to view the match as a passing of the managerial torch between Mourinho and Arbeloa, his former Real Madrid player. Arbeloa spoke glowingly of Mourinho, someone who he said he still stays in touch with.\"I know who Mourinho is, I know what his phone must be like,\" Arbeloa said in his pre-match press conference on Tuesday. \"You can understand why he changes his number so often. I've tried to 'bother' him as little as possible. But he's one of those friends you can go a long time without speaking to, and then if you call him at 3 a.m., I'm sure he'd answer.\"Arbeloa also spoke glowingly of his former boss and commended his work at Real Madrid, where he won a league title.\"What the victory here 12 years ago [by winning the Champions League] meant deserves so much credit, just like Carlo [Ancelotti]'s or [Zinedine] Zidane's later on,\" he said. \"But Mourinho laid the foundations for those years. That's something I feel. I believe he's always been valued within the club. And that's why he was, is, and always will be one of us.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\nSix months after Chelsea won the newly-expanded men's Club World Cup, FIFA is expanding its footprint in the club game with the inaugural edition of the Women's Champions Cup, the first tournament of an ecosystem the organization hopes will revolve around a first-of-its-kind Women's Club World Cup.While the first Women's Club World Cup is currently slated for the winter of 2028, FIFA will proceed with the smaller, annual Women's Champions Cup that acts as a counterpart to the men's Intercontinental Cup. The first-ever Women's Champions Cup kicks into high gear on Wednesday with two semifinals at the Brentford Community Stadium, home of Premier League side Brentford – Gotham FC's clash with Brazil's Corinthians and Arsenal's fixture against Morocco's AS FAR. The final, plus a third-place match, await on Sunday at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium for the last four teams standing.The new FIFA tournament will serve as a first official measuring stick for how teams from different continents in the women's game will stack up against each other, at least partially satisfying the curiosity of many who have wondered how NWSL teams fare against Europe's top sides. A matchup between UEFA Women's Champions League winners Arsenal and Concacaf W Champions Cup victors Gotham is not a guarantee – each of them have to face off against fellow continental champions to earn a fixture against each other.Here's what you need to know about the FIFA Women's Champions Cup semifinals.FIFA Women's Champions Cup semifinal TV scheduleAll times U.S./EasternWednesday, Jan. 28Gotham FC vs. Corinthians, 7:30 a.m. (DAZN, FIFA+)Arsenal vs. AS FAR, 1 p.m. (DAZN, FIFA+)How they qualifiedArsenal, Gotham and Copa Libertadores winners Corinthians qualified directly for the semifinals, while CAF Women's Champions League victors AS FAR made it to London the hard way. The competition technically began in October with a first round match between AFC Women's Champions League Wuhan Jiangda and OFC Women's Champions League victors Auckland United. Wuhan 1-0 and booked a meeting with AS FAR in December, with the Moroccan team winning 2-1 in extra time.Gotham's upward rise continues in LondonSince head coach Juan Carlos Amoros joined Gotham FC ahead of the 2023 NWSL season, the team has gone from strength to strength. They are now two-time league champions and added the inaugural Concacaf W Champions Cup title last season, thrusting them into a first-ever showcase against global competition. They will target another trophy in London to add to their growing collection\"It would be a dream come true for us to be in this position two games away,\" Amoros said. \"Something that is very special. It's been a process of four years it's taken us to get to this competition. We need to win the [NWSL] championship, go next year around North America to qualify for the semifinal, final. Last season, we were able to win in Mexico and now we're here. It will be the pinnacle, the top of the mountain [if we win] at this point. But, we also know that there is even more competitions that we want to keep winning.\"They will be dealing with a disadvantage, though – Gotham are technically in preseason mode. The NWSL regular season will not start until March, forcing them to begin preseason earlier than their domestic opponents. They have been training in Spain since the start of the new year and traveled to London in the days leading up to Wednesday's semifinal, which will be their first match since winning the NWSL Championship the week before Thanksgiving.Gotham will also be without Esther Gonzalez, an NWSL MVP nominee, while she is on parental leave but many of their heavy-hitters are available for selection. Rose Lavelle, who scored the game-winning goal in November's championship, will likely play a meaningful role while Jaedyn Shaw might steal the show. The 21-year-old hit the ground running after joining the team in a blockbuster trade in September and coming with three goal contributions in three games during their playoff run. The game against Corinthians offers a unique chance to show off her skills, especially as someone who had formative experiences with Santos' women's team as a teen.\"It really shaped me as a player to be honest, seeing the vision on the field, knowing how to combine in small spaces, getting out of them on the dribble and the pass: those are some of my strengths,\" she said. \"Just being around Brazilian culture, football and futsal, is something I think really helped me build the passion for the game. It's really where I fell in love with it, I would definitely credit a lot of the way I play to that country.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\nWith the final day of the Champions League league phase upon us, Barcelona are hosting Copenhagen in what could be the highest scoring match of the entire day of soccer. As things stand, Barcelona are on the outside looking in at a top eight place in the table. That's an important goal since it grants an automatic place in the round of 16. For any team, not only does it remove room for error when Barcelona could be stuck with a team like Napoli in the play in phase, but it also provides a chance for much needed rest. Coming into this match, Pedri, Gavi, and Frenkie De Jong are all set to miss out, which accounts for the entire Barcelona starting central midfield. It leaves manager Hansi Flick with quite a few things to think about, but Barcelona will need to score as many goals as they can in this match to ensure that as much is left in their hands as possible.How to watch Barcelona vs. Copenhagen, oddsDate: Wednesday, Jan. 28 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Camp Nou -- Barcelona, SpainLive stream: Paramount+Odds: Barcelona -900; Draw +850; Copenhagen +1800The league phase table is a logjam with a whopping eight teams all on 13 points entering the final day of play.

It's a tough balance that the final day of action brings, but it's one that each manager has to come into the day prepared for. At this stage of the season, everyone is dealing with injuries, which is why even with Flick being without his first choice midfield and potentially Ferran Torres, his attacking trio will be counted on to make things happen.In Champions League play, Copenhagen have conceded four goals twice, and that's the number that Barcelona will need to aim to beat. Teams around them could drop points, but getting to a goal difference of plus 11 will give them the best chance possible to finish in the top eight. To do that, they'll have to find the back of the net quickly and continue to keep pressure on while also ensuring that they keep a clean sheet.Full Champions League standings1Arsenal7700202+18212Bayern Munich7601207+13183Real Madrid7502198+11154Liverpool7502148+6155Tottenham Hotspur7421157+8146PSG74122010+10137Newcastle United7412166+10138Chelsea7412148+6139Barcelona74121813+51310Sporting CP7412149+51311Manchester City7412139+41312Atletico Madrid74121613+31313Atalanta7412109+11314Inter7403137+61215Juventus73311410+41216Borussia Dortmund73221915+41117Galatasaray73139901018Qarabag73131315-21019Olympique Marseille730411110920Bayer Leverkusen72321014-4921Monaco7232814-6922PSV72231514+1823Athletic Club7223711-4824Olympiacos7223813-5825Napoli7223712-5826FC Copenhagen72231117-6827Club Brugge72141217-5728Bodo/Glimt71331214-2629Benfica7205610-4630Pafos7133410-6631Union Saint-Gilloise7205717-10632Ajax7205719-12633Eintracht Frankfurt71151019-9434Slavia Prague7034415-11335Villarreal7016515-10136Kairat7016519-141\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 Farmers Insurance Open tees off on Thursday from Torrey Pines Golf Course in San Diego, Calif., for the third PGA Tour event of the 2026 season. The Farmers Insurance Open features a viable field, including Brooks Koepka making his high-profile PGA Tour return. Xander Schauffele is the +1400 favorite in the latest 2026 Farmers Insurance Open odds, followed by Ludvig Aberg (+1700) and Cameron Young (+1900). Koepka has +5000 odds to win. Many golf bettors will choose to play  PGA Tour prop bets when placing 2026 Farmers Insurance Open bets, and the SportsLine model has found some Farmers Insurance Open prop bets it projects value in, including backing J.J. Spaun to finish in the top 5, which has +550 odds (risk $100 to win $550). The model also likes Jason Day to defeat Keegan Bradley in a tournament matchup at -140 odds. It also finds value in Si Woo Kim, who finished T6 last week, to finish in the top 10 at +290 odds. Before locking in any 2026 Farmers Insurance Open prop picks or other PGA Tour bets on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up over $8,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.This same model has also nailed a whopping 16 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- as well as this year's PGA Championship and Open Championship. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting sites. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Top 2026 Farmers Insurance Open prop picksJ.J. Spaun to finish top 5 (+550)Si Woo Kim to finish top 10 (+290)Jason Day (-140) over Keegan Bradley in a tournament matchupJ.J. Spaun to finish in the top 5 (+550)Spaun was a longshot winner of last year's U.S. Open for his second career PGA Tour victory, and that played a key part in his best FedEx Cup finish on the Tour, placing T25 after barely cracking the top 100 and finishing 98th the year before. Spaun made 21 of 25 cuts last year after making just 16 of 28 the year before. In his season debut this year, Spaun closed the Sony Open with a 4-under 66 on the final round, and the model thinks he can carry that momentum into this weekend. The 35-year-old finished T15 at last year's Farmers Insurance Open. He ranked seventh on the PGA Tour in total strokes gained last year, and the model projects value in him at +550 odds to crack the top 5 this weekend. Click here to bet on Spaun at FanDuel, where new users receieve $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins. Si Woo Kim to finish top 10 (+290)Kim is a four-time PGA Tour winner, and the 30-year-old had three top-10 finishes last year. He missed the cut at last year's Farmers Insurance Open, but he's made it in six of eight career appearances. Kim finished T6 at last week's American Express and just missed the top 10 in the tournament before, finishing T11 at the Sony Open. He's off to a fast start, ranking sixth on the PGA Tour in scoring average, fifth in driving accuracy and ninth in both strokes gained: Off the Tee and strokes gained: Approach to Green. Given his hot start and experience at the Farmers Insurance Open, the model sees value at him at nearly 3-1 odds to finish in the top 10 this weekend. Click here to bet on Kim at FanDuel, where new users receieve $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins. Jason Day (-140) over Keegan BradleyThis is the first tournament the two will compete in together this year, but their starts to the 2026 PGA Tour season have been significantly different. Bradley missed the cut at the Sony Open, while Day finished T2 at last week's American Express. Day closed with an 8-under 64 on Sunday to finish with the best score for anyone not named Scottie Scheffler, which often seems to be the best you can ask for when golfing against the world's No. 1. Two of Day's 13 career PGA Tour wins have come at the Farmers Insurance Open, and he has seven top-10 finishes over his last 13 appearances in this tournament. Meanwhile, Bradley, the most recent USA Ryder Cup captain, has just one top-10 finish over his last six Farmers Insurance Opens. The model expects Day to fight for a top-five spot, while Bradley doesn't crack its top 10. Caesars Sportsbook offers this Farmers Insurance Open prop bet, and you can click here to bet on Day at Caesars Sportsbook, where new users receive a first bet match up to $250 bonus bet win or lose with the promo code CBSSPORTS250BM.Want more picks for the 2026 Farmers Insurance Open?You've seen the SportsLine model's 2026 Farmers Insurance Open props for this weekend.

Purdue has been on a run with the Over as of late as Boilermakers' games have eclipsed the total at a 6-2 clip over the last eight. A big reason for that is Purdue's highly efficient offense, which ranks second in KenPom's offensive rating as Matt Painter's crew is eighth in the nation in field goal percentage.As for the Hoosiers, their offense is ahead of their defense as they are 28th, nationally, in offensive efficiency compared to 57th on the defensive end. Indiana is projected to have the leading scorer in this contest, with Lamar Wilkerson surpassing 20 points, as he's one of eight total players forecasted to reach double-digits. That allows the Over to hit with points to spare with the model calling for 158 combined points. Thus, the Over hits 65.3% of the time.The model also says one side of the spread hits nearly 60% of the time. You can only see that pick at SportsLine.So who wins Indiana vs. Purdue, and which side of the spread hits nearly 60% of the time? Visit SportsLine now to see which side of the Purdue vs. Indiana spread to back, all from the advanced model that has simulated this game 10,000 times, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        And then there were two. Arizona and Miami (Ohio) are the final two undefeated teams in college basketball after No. 3 Michigan rallied late to survive No. 5 Nebraska's upset bid with a 75-72 victory Tuesday in Ann Arbor. Michigan erased a seven-point hole with eight minutes left in regulation to improve to 19-1 and, at 9-1 in the Big Ten, join Michigan State and the Cornhuskers atop the conference standings.The Huskers (20-1, 9-1) lost their perfect record, but won plenty of respect, showing championship-level mettle in their toughest test of the season without star big man Rienk Mast (illness) and stud sixth man Braden Frager (ankle injury). Even with two of its best four players sidelined, Nebraska gave Michigan all it could handle and then some with a barrage of treys in the first half. The Huskers dropped 50 on Michigan's vaunted defense in the first 20 minutes alone, but they ran out of gas down the stretch. Nebraska didn't score a single point for the final 3:21 of the gameBoth Michigan and Nebraska came into the game as projected No. 1 seeds in the CBS Sports Bracketology model and are both expected to remain on the top line after their only regular-season meeting when the NCAA Tournament bracket projection updates Wednesday.After Nebraska's loss, No. 24 Miami defeated UMass 86-84 and matched No. 1 Arizona's 21-0 mark this season. The Wildcats held on to defeat No. 13 BYU 86-83 on Monday. \n\n        \n            \n                Arizona is 21-0. The scary part? It can still get better\n                \n                    Matt Norlander                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHome losses are killers for Big Ten Championship hopes, and Michigan was on life support until it got a spark from some unlikely sources. Senior forward Will Tschetter changed the tenor of the game with his attention to detail defensively and constant energy. Tschetter finished with seven points, didn't miss a shot and Michigan outscored Nebraska by eight points in his 15 minutes of playing time. Freshman Trey McKenney hopped off the bench and was terrific, pouring in 11 points, including a go-ahead, big-boy bucket in the final minute.Without key contributions from McKenney and Tschetter, Nebraska very well could have notched one of the most impressive road wins of the season. \nUltimately, Michigan used its patented brawn to finally put the Huskers away for good. Michigan had six enormous offensive rebounds in the second half to stem the tide and stay alive. Morez Johnson Jr. erupted for 17 points and 12 rebounds. His frontcourt mate, Aday Mara, chipped in 10 points and seven boards. \nPryce Sandfort was outstanding for the Huskers, yet again, chipping in 20 points. Jamarques Lawrence hit some big-time treys in the first half on his way to 20 points. Former walk-on Sam Hoiberg (13 points, seven rebounds, five assists and four steals) continued his stellar breakout season.\n            ",

Arne Slot has had a tough job following up on Liverpool's Premier League title-winning charge of last season, but no one expected the Reds to be 14 points off league leaders Arsenal and currently out of a Champions League place due to going winless in their last five Premier League matches. But to their credit, that malaise hasn't translated to European play. In that competition, Liverpool are coming off an impressive victory over Olympique Marseille that saw Mohamed Salah make his return to the squad in a shutout victory.How to watch Liverpool vs. Qarabag, oddsDate: Wednesday, Jan. 27 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Anfield -- Liverpool. England Live stream: Paramount+Odds: Liverpool -1000; Draw +900; Qarabag +2200Returning home to Anfield, they can keep that momentum going if they're able to secure a top eight place in the league phase, which would give the Reds an automatic berth into the last 16 of the Champions League. Despite their struggles recently, Liverpool have been unbeaten at home in their last six matches, and all they need is a victory over Qarabag to get the job done. With how many games teams at the top levels of soccer need to play in a given season, anything that would save the Reds a couple matches down the road will go a long way, but that doesn't mean that the Azerbaijani side will be an easy out in this competition.Among the surprise sides so far, Qarabag are in 18th in the league phase, as one of the surprises of the tournament so far. Coming into this campaign, they had never secured a Champions League win in their history, but here they are on the cusp of making the knockouts with only Liverpool in their path. Because of this, the Reds will need to make sure that they don't take this match for granted despite being heavy favorites. The defense has been susceptible, with only two clean sheets in their last five matches and Qarabag have been excellent on the counter attack. Even if the Reds go up early in the match, no team have won more points from losing positions than Qarabag. Along with Barcelona, they've picked up seven points when going behind.\nThis will put pressure on Florian Wirtz and Mohamed Salah to push the attack forward while Virgil Van Dijk looks to steady the defense. Like many of the matches on the final day of league phase action, this is one which could be very open but a track meet will certinaly favor the Reds.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Tennessee Titans have hired Brian Daboll as offensive coordinator after previous reports stated that Daboll would land in Nashville if he didn't get the Las Vegas Raiders' head coaching job. Daboll is the latest addition to a Titans staff that is being put together by coach Robert Saleh, who was recently hired after spending the past season as the San Francisco 49ers' defensive coordinator. This is Saleh's second coaching opportunity after he spent three-plus years with New York Jets from 2021-24. Like Saleh, Daboll is a former coach who was fired during his fourth season on the job. Daboll served as the New York Giants' coach for three-plus years before he was relieved of his duties this season when New York got off to a 2-8 start. The Giants have since replaced Daboll with John Harbaugh, who was fired by the Baltimore Ravens shortly after the 2025 regular season concluded.\nWhile it didn't end on a great note, Daboll's time in the Big Apple did include leading the Giants to the franchise's first playoff win since defeating the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLVI. The Giants were unable to match that success during Daboll's final three seasons, however, which led to his firing. It's worth noting that Daboll's time in New York also included several personnel decisions by general manager Joe Schoen that didn't age well, most notably his decision to pay Daniel Jones over Saquon Barkley, then releasing Jones less than two years later. \nPrior to coming to New York, Daboll enjoyed a successful four-year run as the Bills' offensive coordinator while working with quarterback Josh Allen. His NFL coaching background also includes offensive coordinator stints with the Cleveland Browns, Miami Dolphins and Kansas City Chiefs. Daboll also won five Super Bowls as a member of the New England Patriots' coaching staff.\n            \n    ",

This was Belichick's first year of eligibility since he has not coached in the NFL since 2023. According to ESPN, several associates close to Belichick told the outlet that he was \"puzzled\" and \"disappointed\" by the lack of support from the Pro Football Hall of Fame's committee members. Belichick, who is entering his second year in college football as the coach at North Carolina, is the NFL's most successful coach in the Super Bowl era. He has won eight total Super Bowls: two as an assistant as six as a head coach with the Patriots, the latter of which is an NFL record. His 12 Super Bowl appearances are also an NFL record. He is second all-time among NFL coaches with 333 career wins, trailing only two-time Super Bowl winner and Hall of Famer Don Shula at 347. Belichick's 31 playoff wins are more than any coach in NFL history. As are his 17 divisional championships as a head coach. Under Belichick's guidance, New England won the AFC East each year from 2009-19. \n\n        \n            \n                Bill Belichick's snub demands a Hall of Fame reckoning\n                \n                    Jonathan Jones                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe sticking point with Belichick, according to ESPN, are the multiple scandals that he was embroiled in during his time with the Patriots. In 2007, Belichick was fined $500,000 -- the largest fine ever levied against an NFL coach to that point -- for his involvement in the Spygate scandal. The Patriots also lost a first-round pick in the 2008 NFL Draft. \"The only explanation [for the outcome] was the cheating stuff,\" a Hall of Fame voter told ESPN. \"It really bothered some of the guys.\"\nThe same logic was applied to New England owner Robert Kraft when he was passed over again for induction in 2025. Kraft is a finalist for the 2026 Hall of Fame class for the first time after gaining eligibility 14 years ago. \n            \n    ",

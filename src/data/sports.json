Of his 26 victories, 20 have come via knockout, five have come via decision, and just one has come from submitting his opponent. Of his five defeats, three have come from being knocked out and two have been via submission. Gaethje has never lost a decision in his professional career.Fighting out of Denver, Gaethje is aiming for his second Interim UFC Lightweight Championship after winning it the first time at UFC 249 in a TKO victory over Tony Ferguson. However, he then lost his next bout for the UFC Lightweight Championship, falling to Khabib Nurmagomedov. Gaethje had another shot to claim gold when he challenged Charles Oliveira for the title at UFC 274 but again came up short. He has held the symbolic UFC \"BMF\" title, which he won via a triumph over Dustin Poirier at UFC 291. Check out SportsLine to see Vithlani's picks and analysis.Pimblett, 31, has a BJJ background and made his professional debut as a 17-year-old in his native Liverpool, England. He fought at bantamweight and featherweight for over five years before moving up to lightweight in 2018. Since then, he's won 10 of 11 bouts, including each of the last nine, and Pimblett sports a 7-0 record since joining UFC in 2021. He can triumph in a number of ways as of his 23 victories, 10 have been via submission, seven have come thanks to a knockout, and six have been via winning on the scorecards.While he won championships in other promotions, UFC 324 will be his first title bout since linking up with the promotion. Pimblett, however, has been awarded Performance of the Night in five of his last seven fights, including in back-to-back bouts. He's also a perfect 3-0 in his MMA career in Las Vegas, while Gaethje sports a 3-1 record in Sin City. You can only see UFC 324 picks and analysis at SportsLine. UFC 324: Gaethje vs. Pimblett predictionsOne of of Vithlani's UFC 324 picks: He's backing Jean Silva (-205) to defeat Arnold Allen (+175) in a matchup on the main card.\"Silva's 5-0 start to his UFC career came to a screeching halt in his last fight against featherweight title challenger Diego Lopes,\" Vithlani said. \"After finishing his first five UFC opponents, Silva was beat up and knocked out badly by Lopes in a nasty fight. Prior to that, Silva was emerging as the division's fastest-rising prospect. I think he can get back to haunting his fellow featherweights, starting with Allen. Allen is an active southpaw kickboxer and a capable grappler, but he won't have the advantage on the ground like Lopes did. Allen will need to stay on his lateral movement and try to out-volume Silva, but one big right hand or left hook from Silva could change this fight instantly.\" See who else to back here. You can make this pick at FanDuel, where new users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to make UFC 324: Gaethje vs. Pimblett picksVithlani has strong picks for Gaethje vs. Pimblett and other bouts on the UFC 324 card.

Nurmagomedov got a sample of what it's like to beat a titleholder by dominating former two-time flyweight champion Deiveson Figueiredo in the featured preliminary match as UFC made its debut on Paramount+. Nurmagomedov, who is now neck-and-neck with Sean O'Malley and Merab Dvalishvili in the bantamweight contenders pool, had a chance to separate himself from his contemporaries on Saturday. Whether his clear win over Figueiredo was enough to move the needle is up to interpretation. Sign up for Paramount+ and WATCH UFC 324 LIVE for no additional fee -- every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with your subscription! Plans start as low as $8.99/month or $89.99/year!Nurmagomedov swept Figueiredo on the scorecards without much difficulty. However, many likely expected more dominance from a -1600 betting favorite, per DraftKings. Nurmagomedov stood as the biggest favorite on the entire UFC 324 card. He outstruck Figueiredo by multitudes, took him down to the mat and maintained solid ground control; however, what Nurmagomedov failed to do was put Figueiredo in serious trouble. \nMuch of that blame can be placed on Figueiredo. The savvy veteran largely backpedaled, avoiding engagement with Nurmagomedov. Figueiredo briefly unleashed his \"God of War\" persona in Round 2, but his offensive output lasted approximately 25 seconds.Ultimately, the fight was a clear but forgettable decision on a Paramount+ debut littered with knockouts. Even more concerning? Nurmagomedov was not granted a post-fight interview despite being the preliminary headliner.\nNurmagomedov (No. 2 BW) improved to 20-1. The cousin and pupil of UFC Hall of Famer Khabib Nurmagomedov, Umar's lone loss was a competitive UFC bantamweight title fight with Dvalishvili. Figueiredo (No. 6) has had mixed success since moving up to bantamweight. He's 4-3 in the division and missed weight for this fight by 2.5 pounds.\n            \n    ",

The fighters overdelivered, producing fireworks for the first UFC main card on Paramount+. In the end, Silva managed to bounce back from his first UFC defeat with a strong decision win on Saturday.Allen and Silva fight with very different philosophies. Allen is a strategist: measured offensively and defensively sound. Silva is a berserker: ultra potent with reckless abandon. Allen leaned on his patented durability, overcoming close calls and marching into the fire. Allen was never overwhelmed, but couldn't keep up with Silva's pressure.Sign up for Paramount+ and WATCH UFC 324 LIVE for no additional fee -- every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with your subscription! Plans start as low as $8.99/month or $89.99/year!\nAllen looked sharp in Round 1, but a late body strike forced him to retreat under a barrage of strikes. Impressed, Allen offered Silva a high-five, which was ignored. Allen, upset by the perceived disrespect, shoved Silva after the round and was verbally warned by the referee. The wild fight continued in rounds two and three. Both men threw various kicks and spinning techniques, with Silva landing greater impact and volume. Silva's wild man reputation shone through on Saturday. With seconds left in the fight, Silva jumped onto a prone Allen's back and jumped off. \nThe competitive friction between them evaporated the moment the final buzzer sounded. Silva tearfully embraced Allen, and both men shared their mutual respect on the microphone. \nAll three judges agreed that Silva did the better work across three rounds. The Fighting Nerds' representative was awarded one 30-27 scorecard and a pair of 29-28s. During his post-fight interview, Silva set his sights on the featherweight title. His lone UFC defeat came against Diego Lopes, who is fighting for the belt a second time at UFC 325 on Jan. 31 after losing to Alexander Volkanovski last year.\n            \n    ",

Cortes-Acosta registered his third consecutive knockout in as many months at UFC 324.It's hard to stand out in the UFC. There are many fighters and many events. Cortes-Acosta is separating himself from the pack with incredible activity and KO power. Cortes-Acosta, fighting for the sixth time in 10 months, systematically dissected Lewis before stopping the two-time title challenger.Cortes-Acosta fought with composure that will serve him well against elite heavyweights. Cortes-Acosta used his speed to stay away from Lewis' historic power, further immobilizing \"The Black Beast\" with jabs and leg kicks. Lewis cranked up the pressure to create opportunities, but found himself getting rocked by counter punches. Sign up for Paramount+ and WATCH UFC 324 LIVE for no additional fee -- every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with your subscription!

Lewis showed no urgency to stand up, allowing Cortes-Acosta to swarm him. Referee Jason Herzog demanded a response from the downed fighter, but Lewis didn't muster meaningful resistance. Lewis shelled up under a barrage of strikes that forced a second-round TKO finish.\n\"I want Curtis Blaydes,\" Cortes-Acosta said, through Portuguese interpreter Fabian Buskei, during his post-fight interview. \"He's talking a lot of crap, and I need to shut him up.\"\nCortes-Acosta's callout makes sense. Blaydes is ranked ahead of him in the heavyweight division, and there seems to be bad blood. But it's possible Cortes-Acosta could set his sights higher. UFC heavyweight champion Tom Aspinall is sidelined indefinitely with eye injuries. Aspinall's absence could spur the creation of an interim heavyweight title. There are higher-ranked contenders in the mix, but few, if any, have built so much cache with matchmakers and fans in such a short time frame. \n            \n    ",

CampbellBrookhouseMahjouriMormileWiseGaethje vs. PimblettPimblettPimblettPimblettGaethjeGaethjeO'Malley vs. YadongO'MalleyO'MalleyO'MalleyO'MalleyYadongCortes-Acosta vs. LewisLewisCortes-AcostaCortes-AcostaLewisLewisSilva vs. NamajunasSilvaSilvaSilvaNamajunasNamajunasAllen vs. SilvaAllenSilvaSilvaSilvaSilvaJustin Gaethje vs. Paddy Pimblett predictionsCampbell: Now that Pimblett has evolved into a more focused and precise version of himself at age 31 (along with getting himself into world-class physical shape), his speed and length advantages figure to be an issue for the battle-tested Gaethje. It should go without saying that Pimblett will need to show a sturdy chin early and live up to his slogan that \"Scousers don't get knocked out.\" But for as dangerous as Gaethje is, Pimblett holds a distinct advantage on the ground with his submission game opposite a strong amateur wrestling background for Gaethje that surprisingly never gets utilized in his UFC bouts. Pimblett will take his time and eventually expose the aging chin of his 37-year-old opponent in a breakthrough win. Pimblett via TKO4\nBrookhouse: Gaethje hasn't been very active in recent years and is now 37. Add in that he's taken a more patient and tactical approach to fighting in the later stages of his career and I think you have the recipe for Pimblett to win this fight. Pimblett has the length to punish Gaethje on the outside and can tangle Gaethje up and use trips to take the fight to the ground. If the fight hits the floor, that's far more Pimblett's world, whether he is attacking with submissions or dominating position to deliver strikes. This feels like a great fight for Pimblett to get the biggest win of his career. Pimblett via SUB2Mahjouri: I promised to stop picking against Pimblett after he thrashed Michael Chandler. He doesn't make it easy. Statistically, it's hard to see Pimblett's path to victory.  Pimblett is a dual-finishing threat, but falls short in key categories. Gaethje is the more powerful and experienced striker with surprisingly higher striking defense. Pimblett has the biggest advantage on the ground, but historically lacks the offensive wrestling required to take the fight there. What these overall statistics don't conclude are their recent trajectories. Pimblett, 31, makes meaningful improvements from fight to fight. Chandler and King Green are indeed over the hill, but Pimblett beat them with such ease that you can't dismiss his growth. Gaethje, 37, is nearing the end by his own admission. Pimblett will properly prepare for this dangerous task. He'll know to keep his chin down -- a recurring bad habit of his -- against a juggernaut like Gaethje. Pimblett via SUB4Mormile: Gaethje via TKOWise: Gaethje via UDSean O'Malley vs. Song Yadong predictionsCampbell: O'Malley badly needs a win following back-to-back title losses to former champion Merab Dvalishvili. But the fact that Petr Yan, who defeated Dvashvili in their December rematch to once again become bantamweight king, holds a 2022 loss to O'Malley by split decision means that a rematch could be next if \"Suga\" can keep pace atop the division rankings. For as strong and solid as Yadong has become at age 28 following eight years as a UFC fighter, his style is still too basic for O'Malley not to expose over 15 minutes with his dynamic striking attack. While Yadong is durable enough to prevent O'Malley from delivering a highlight-reel statement and should prove able to keep the fight competitive, expect a return to form from the former champion. O'Malley via UD\nBrookhouse: We've seen O'Malley struggle against men who bring heavy pressure and can make him uncomfortable with grappling. Yadong isn't that fighter, though. Yadong is a good striker, but he is going to struggle to stay in his striking range, while O'Malley can work from the outside and utilize his length. Yadong doesn't really have the game to force O'Malley out of his comfort zone or rhythm and that should let O'Malley cruise to a decision win. O'Malley via UDMahjouri: O'Malley still has life in him as an elite bantamweight. He admits taking consecutive fights against Dvalishvili was a mistake, and took ample time off to address nagging injuries. He's a precise, powerful striker with a solid grappling game. Song is one of the more well-rounded fighters in the division, but his experience with elite bantamweights suggests his ceiling is below the title level. Song's win over Henry Cejudo was too competitive, considering the future Hall of Famer retired one fight later. His losses to Cory Sandhagen and Yan further drive home the point. Song can certainly play spoiler, but I fear we forget how thoroughly O'Malley dissected Marlon Vera in their rematch. O'Malley via UDMormile: O'Malley via UDWise: Yadong via TKO2Cortes-Acosta vs. Lewis predictionsCampbell: With four wins in five appearances alone over the past 10 months, Cortes-Acosta has rapidly become a legitimate threat to the heavyweight title picture. But the grind of constantly being in training camp can become a grind that sneaks up on fighters over time. And Lewis, who claims he is entering this fight in arguably the best shape of his career, is the wrong fighter to potentially make a mistake against or have an off night. Even at 40, the UFC's record holder for career knockouts is still as dangerous as ever. Lewis has won three of his last four fights, all by stoppage, and still owns the ability to weather damage before delivering the dramatic finish. The fact that Lewis feels so healthy after years of nagging injuries and fluctuating weight should be taken seriously here. Lewis via KO2\nBrookhouse: Lewis has an unbelievable ability to find ways to land fight-ending bombs against almost anyone, so he can never be counted out in any fight. That said, Cortes-Acosta is the more well-rounded fighter and has shown the ability to shift from striking to a measured, slower-paced approach to neutralizing dangerous big men. Cortes-Acosta may be willing to risk some exchanges early, but he'll likely shift to takedowns to try and keep Lewis grounded and away from throwing his looping power shots. It may not be pretty, but this is a fight Cortes-Acosta can grind away with repeated takedowns. Cortes-Acosta via decisionMahjouri: The jury is out on Cortes-Acosta. Is he a legitimate elite heavyweight or the type of hype train that Lewis feeds on? I believe it's the former. Cortes-Acosta has won seven of his last eight fights and took a round off interim title challenger Serghei Pavlovich in his lone loss during that stretch. It's Cortes-Acosta's striking defense that inspires confidence. Don't let his recent string of knockouts fool you; he knows how to stay safe and win fights over 15 minutes. Cortes-Acosta should employ a responsible style, mixing distance and footwork with carefully timed takedown attempts. If he can avoid Lewis' blitzes, an admittedly hard ask against the UFC KO record holder, he should win the fight on the scorecards or with a late knockout.

    "body": "\n        Saturday at the 2026 American Express saw the breeze pick up for the first time all week, which slowed some of the scoring barrage from the first 36 holes in La Quinta, California. That was apparent at the top of the leaderboard, where Scottie Scheffler -- fresh off rounds of 63 and 64 -- faced the stronger test of the Stadium Course at PGA West and shot a 4-under 68 to enter the final round at 20 under.Scheffler made his first bogey of the week on the 3rd, adding another square to the card on the back nine. It looked like he would drop another shot on the 18th after a poor approach from the fairway and a chip that got away from him, but he poured in a 25-footer to hold onto a share of second and keep himself in the penultimate group on Sunday. Scheffler's gritty par at the last keeps him just one shot back of Si Woo Kim, who posted a 66 at La Quinta Country Club to surge ahead of the world No. 1 and into the solo lead at 22 under. Kim strung together three straight birdies on his back nine late in the afternoon, taking advantage of calmer conditions to make a move to the top of the leaderboard. \nJoining Scheffler at 21 under is 18-year-old Blade Brown, who shot a 68 of his own at the Stadium Course to head into the final round where he started the day -- tied with the Texan. Brown, fresh off a 60 on Saturday, managed to stay patient on the tougher course in tougher conditions, and he will now get his first taste of a Sunday in contention at a PGA Tour event. \n\"Just staying level,\" Brown said when asked what he did best on Saturday. \"There's so many emotions that you go through in a round. I was 1 under through 15 holes, and I knew that there were some guys coming up the leaderboard that were going to make a run. I tried to put myself in as many birdie positions as possible and happened to make three coming down the stretch.\"That trio will headline Sunday's final round at the Stadium Course, as the field gets trimmed to the top 60 and ties with the pros no longer stuck in foursomes with amateur partners. Brown and Kim will play together in the final pairing with Scheffler hot on their heels in the penultimate group, looking to apply pressure from a hole ahead all afternoon. Leader1. Si Woo Kim (-22): Kim became a bit of the forgotten man on Friday despite a blistering 63-65 start to his week, as much of the focus shifted to Brown's performance in nearly shooting 59 and Scheffler's presence on top of the leaderboard. However, Kim has been the most steady performer this week, shooting a 66 or better in all three rounds. He's proven over his career that he can take it deep when he feels good. That's certainly been the case this week, and the courses in the rotation at the American Express have played into his aggressive style. His ball-striking combined with a hot putter make him a real threat, and if there's one thing we can count on, it's that he won't start playing conservatively on Sunday to protect the lead. \nContendersT2. Scottie Scheffler, Blades Brown (-21)T4. Eric Cole, Wyndham Clark (-20)T6. Tom Hoge, Matt McCarty, Andrew Putnam (-19)9. J.T. Poston (-18)T10. Patrick Cantlay and four others (-17)Scheffler is still the favorite despite being a shot back of Kim, and it felt like his 68 on Saturday at the Stadium Course came with him playing about as poorly as possible. That should set the bar for what we'll see in the final round, pending winds really picking up. Kim, Brown and everyone else in the chase group should be thinking 25 under is about the minimum they'll need if they aim to beat Scheffler. Brown's story this week is incredible as he's about to play his eighth straight competitive round of golf after finishing in the top 20 at a Korn Ferry Tour event in the Bahamas earlier this week. It helps to be 18 years old and able to recover quickly, but Brown's mental approach has been particularly impressive. His patience on Saturday paid off with a hot finish, and while he'll have to manage new nerves on Sunday, nothing about his performance to this point suggests he won't embrace the moment. \nBeyond the top three, Clark is the most threatening name of the chase pack. He played his best round of the week on the Stadium Course on Friday and appears to be back in form after a down year in 2025. He kept things on track with a 66 on Saturday and will be looking to notch his first win in more than a year. Notable names to miss the cut Chris Kirk (-9)Will Zalatoris (-9)Tony Finau (-9)Justin Rose (-8)Brian Harman (-7)Sepp Straka (-2)Akshay Bhatia (-1)Ludvig Åberg (WD -- Illness)2026 American Express updated odds, picksOdds via DraftKings SportsbookScottie Scheffler (+100)Si Woo Kim (+200)Blades Brown (+800)Wyndham Clark (+1100)Eric Cole (+1700)Schefter's presence one shot off the lead lengthens the odds significantly of those trying to chase down the leaders on Sunday. The best value on the board at this point has to be Clark, who has the gears needed to post a low enough score to win and seems to be extremely comfortable at the Stadium Course. I liked him as a threat to win on Friday, and nothing about his performance on Saturday changed my mind that he's going to be in the mix all the way til the end. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        On the heels of a national championship, Indiana coach Curt Cignetti's reverence for the Big Ten this season continued in his final coaches poll top 25 ballot this week after he placed eight conference teams in his rankings, including significant postseason rises from Iowa and Illinois. Following Indiana's national championship win over Miami, Cignetti placed his Hoosiers at No. 1, followed by the Hurricanes, Oregon, Ole Miss and Ohio State inside the top five.The Big Ten dominated bowl season and placed three teams in the College Football Playoff, ending with the league's third consecutive national title. The SEC is 1-5 in CFP games against non-conference competition since Georgia's 65-7 win over TCU in the national title during the final year of the four-team era.\"I think it's called paradigm shift,\" Cignetti said after Monday's win. \"It's kind of like people can cling to an old way of thinking, categorizing teams as this or that of conferences as this or that, where they can't adjust to the new world.\"\n        \n            \n                Indiana's national championship isn't a fairy tale. It's a warning for college football's old order\n                \n                    Brandon Marcello                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nCignetti ranked seven SEC teams, including six in the top 13. But notably, Cignetti placed Iowa at No. 11 ahead of Alabama, whom the Hoosiers beat, 38-3, in the CFP quarterfinals. Illinois is No. 16 on Cignetti's ballot. The Fighting Illini beat Tennessee in the Music City Bowl and lost to Indiana during the regular season, 63-10.\nMichigan and Washington are ranked No. 17 and No. 18. The Hoosiers didn't play either team this season. Michigan lost to Texas in the Citrus Bowl while Washington dominated Boise State, 38-10, in the LA Bowl.This season was the Big Ten's first three-peat since the 1940s. Indiana went unbeaten while beating six top-10 teams, strengthening its unprecedented finish.\"I would like to say our NIL is nowhere near what people think it is, so you can throw that out, and this team really overcame a lot on the road in a lot of tight games and found a way to get it done,\" Cignetti said. \"And we're 16-0, and I guess we're 27-2 since Indiana. But we're 16-0, national champions at Indiana University, which I know a lot of people thought was never possible. \n\"It probably is one of the greatest sports stories of all time.

The hero? Mark Mitchell, whose game-winning 3-pointer over two defenders sent Mizzou Arena into pandemonium.But the drama started at the end of regulation. With Oklahoma ahead 81-78 and just five seconds remaining, Missouri junior Trent Pierce -- a Tulsa native -- hit his only field goal of the night: a 37-foot pull-up 3-pointer off an assist from T.O. Barrett, forcing overtime and keeping the Tigers' hopes alive.Overtime was just as tense. Oklahoma guard Xzayvier Brown hit a floater with four seconds left to give the Sooners an 87-85 lead, seemingly putting Missouri out of options. But with no timeouts, Barrett quickly threw the inbound pass to Mitchell, who dribbled five times to the 3-point line and calmly drained the buzzer-beater to stun the Sooners.\nMitchell finished with a team-high 25 points and added 10 rebounds for his fifth career double-double. He also hit a milestone in the second half, surpassing 1,500 career points. Barrett added to the effort with a career-high 21 points in his first start to go with six rebounds and three steals, while Jayden Stone chipped in 20 points and seven boards. Oklahoma got big performances from Nijel Pack (25 points, five assists) and Brown (19 points, six assists), but the Sooners dropped their sixth straight SEC game and remain at the bottom of the standings ahead of Tuesday's matchup against No. 20 Arkansas.\nFor Missouri, the thrilling win gives it momentum after losing three of its previous four games. The Tigers travel to No. 17 Alabama on Tuesday.\n            \n    ",

I went 1-3 against the spread last week -- New England was the only winner -- and 3-1 straight up.My playoffs have been so bad that there is a chance I might not finish above .500 for the year ATS.

I seem to be choking in a big way.Championship Sunday NFL betting lines via DraftKings Sportsbook.New England Patriots at Denver Broncos (+5.5)Sunday, 3 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nWith Bo Nix out with a broken ankle, the Broncos will turn to Jarrett Stidham at quarterback in this one. He hasn't thrown a regular-season pass since 2023, but Broncos coach Sean Payton believes in him. And when he does, he usually lets the quarterback play loose.The New England defense can be stingy, especially against the run, which can put more pressure on Payton to scheme up things to make it easier for Stidham. I think Payton is one of the best play callers in the league, so I think he will.On the other side, Drake Maye will be making his first road playoff start for the Patriots. That can be daunting, especially against a good Denver defense. But Maye has been good on the road this season. Then again, this is the playoffs.The Bills ran on the Broncos last week, so I expect the Patriots to try to do the same. New England is averaging 156.1 rushing yards per game over the last seven games, but I think Denver will be better this time against the run.It would be easy to pick the Pats here based on Stidham playing. But I think the Denver players will elevate their games around him and Payton will have a big day calling the game for him. I think Denver's defense will get the best of the Pats offense.

The Seahawks rallied to win the last meeting in Seattle in Week 16 in overtime, which is why this game is at home.The Rams are playing a third straight road game, which is brutal, but teams have overcome that in the past in the playoffs. If any coach can get his team right for that, it's Rams coach Sean McVay.The Rams struggled some on offense last week in their victory over the Bears. This Seattle defense is much better than that Bears group. But Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford has had success against them in the two games.The Seattle defense is the best unit of any left in the playoffs, which will challenge McVay to come up with new ways to move the football. The Rams lack great outside speed, and that showed up last week at Chicago. Keep an eye on that in this one. On the other side, the Rams defense has had some leakage issues in the secondary over the past six weeks. It is not a great group. The good news is Seattle wants to run it more than throw it.Seattle quarterback Sam Darnold is the key. If he can take care of the football, which he didn't do in a playoff loss to the Rams last year when he was with the Vikings, the Seahawks will win the game. I think he does. The Seattle defense is playing too good right now. That defensive front will disrupt the night for Stafford as the Seahawks get to the Super Bowl behind that defense.Pick: Seahawks 23, Rams 17\n            ",

Despite the Bills having a poor run defense, the Broncos went with a pass-happy game plan, dropping Bo Nix back over 50 times while they ran the ball with RJ Harvey and Jaleel McLaughlin only 10 times combined. The Broncos are back in the conference title game for the first time since 2015, when a truly elite defense led the way with Peyton Manning and the offense struggling down the stretch. The Broncos won the Super Bowl that year, and they'll have to hope that their defense can similarly carry the way this year with Nix out injured.New England is coming off a fairly comfortable 28-16 victory over the Houston Texans last week, during which the Patriots' defense forced five turnovers and held C.J. Stroud and Co. to just 241 total yards. Their defense has stepped up in both playoff games so far, holding the Chargers to just 207 yards and three points in the previous contest. New England is looking to get back to the mountaintop for the first time since the Tom Brady era, having been in the quarterback wilderness before landing Drake Maye in last year's draft and ascending back to the top of the AFC East this season.\n        \n            \n                Broncos vs. Patriots: AFC Championship expert picks, odds, NFL playoffs best bets, where to watch, TV, stream\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhich of these two teams will advance to the Super Bowl and earn a chance to compete for the Lombardi Trophy?

Backup quarterback Jarrett Stidham will start in his place. Stidham has made four career starts, going 1-3 for the Raiders and Broncos. In his 20 career appearances, he's completed 117 of 197 passes (59.4%) for 1,422 yards (7.2 per attempt), eight touchdowns and eight interceptions. He's taken a sack on 8.8% of his dropbacks, though, which is a significantly higher rate than the 3.8% sack rate Nix has posted throughout his career. That could be a factor in this game.Drake Maye vs. the blitz. Maye absolutely carved up blitzing defenses during the regular season. He went 114 of 163 (69.9%) for 1,491 yards (9.1 per attempt), 15 touchdowns and no interceptions when opponents sent five or more rushers after him, ranking first in the league in EPA per dropback, via TruMedia. He's only 8 of 17 against the blitz in the playoffs, but he's thrown for 138 yards, two scores and no picks. The Broncos blitz more than any team in the NFL, as we'll dive into below.Broncos pass rush. During the regular season, Denver finished third in the NFL with a 42.1% pressure rate, according to TruMedia. The Broncos also checked in third in sack-to-pressure ratio, turning 23.3% of their pressures into sacks. They're going to need to put copious pressure on Maye to win this game -- but also do it without blitzing, which they did at the NFL's highest rate, for the reasons mentioned above. Luckily for the Broncos, their four-man pass rush also got to the quarterback at the third-highest rate in the league during the regular season. Their rate of four-man pressures has held up in the playoffs, and they'll need to get home that way if they want to advance to the Super Bowl.Rhamondre Stevenson's breakout. Since New England's bye week back in Week 14, Stevenson has gone absolutely berserk. In four regular-season games, he ran 29 times for 279 yards and four touchdowns, while also catching 12 passes for 131 yards and two additional scores. In the two playoff games, Stevenson has another 26 carries for 123 yards, with seven catches for 86 yards. He seems to have taken the backfield reins back from TreVeyon Henderson, who had his own midseason breakout when Stevenson missed time due to injury. Henderson still provides an explosive-play threat, though, so the Pats now have a backfield duo that can beat defenses in a variety of ways. PredictionThis one is pretty simple: the Broncos will not have their starting quarterback for this game. It's really hard to see them putting together a representative offensive performance with Jarrett Stidham at the helm -- especially given how well the New England defense has played so far during the playoffs in holding down offenses piloted by Justin Herbert and C.J. Stroud. New England's offense hasn't exactly lit the world on fire in either of its games against elite defenses, and the Broncos present another one for them to go up against, but I have far more trust in Drake Maye going against a Denver unit that has actually shown some leaks since its bye week, than I do in Stidham and Co. against the Pats.\nPrediction: Patriots 21, Broncos 10\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

The Seahawks blasted the Niners, 41-6, in a game that was never remotely close after Rashid Shaheed took the opening kickoff to the house for a touchdown. The Seahawks are now in the conference title game for the first time since 2014, when they went to back-to-back Super Bowls during the \"Legion of Boom\" era.Los Angeles is coming off a dramatic, overtime victory over the Chicago Bears in the divisional round, which followed a similarly dramatic win over the Carolina Panthers on Wild Card Weekend. The Rams have won their two playoff games by a combined six points, but they've advanced to the title game nonetheless. They were last here back in the 2021 season, when Matthew Stafford led the team to its first Super Bowl since 1999, and now they're looking to get back to the same mountaintop.\n        \n            \n                Seahawks vs. Rams: NFC Championship expert picks, odds, NFL playoffs best bets, where to watch, TV, stream\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhich of these two teams will advance to the Super Bowl and earn a chance to compete for the Lombardi Trophy? We'll find out soon enough. Before we detail some key storylines, here's a look at how you can watch the game.Where to watch Seahawks vs. Rams liveDate: Sunday, Jan. 25 | Time: 6:30 p.m. ETLocation: Lumen Field (Seattle)TV: Fox | Streaming: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Seahawks -2.5, O/U 46.5 via DraftKings Sportsbook\nKey StorylinesGrudge match. The Rams beat the Seahawks in the first of the teams' two regular-season meetings, prevailing 21-19, a game in which their defense forced four interceptions from Sam Darnold. The Seahawks won the second game in dramatic fashion in overtime, converting a pair of two-point tries along the way as they stormed back from a 30-14 fourth-quarter deficit and got themselves the inside track to the No. 1 seed that allows them to host this conference title game. Sam Darnold vs. Chris Shula. Darnold had a miserable time against Shula's defense in the playoffs last year and in the first matchup of this season. He went 25 of 40 for 245 yards, one touchdown and one interception while taking an incredible nine sacks in last year's playoff game. He went 29 of 44 for 279 yards and the aforementioned four picks in the first matchup this season. And in the first three quarters of the second matchup this season, he went 10 of 16 for 126 yards and another pick. But he went off in the fourth quarter and overtime of that second game, completing 12 of 18 passes for 144 yards, two scores and a pick (and the game-winning two-point conversion in OT) to lead the team back from its 16-point deficit. The Seahawks need more of the latter version of Darnold than the former if they want to stave off the Rams again. The Rams' secondary can be leaky on occasion, so it's likely a matter of keeping Darnold well protected, giving him time to make the right decisions rather than rushing and becoming more susceptible to mistakes.Matthew Stafford vs. Mike Macdonald. Stafford largely struggled in the first matchup between these two teams this season, going just 15 of 28 for 130 yards (a season-low average of 4.6 per attempt), albeit while throwing a pair of touchdowns and no picks. But he went nuclear in the second matchup, throwing for 457 yards and three scores while completing 29 of 49 pass attempts. He didn't take a sack or turn the ball over in either game. With Puka Nacua and Davante Adams on the outside, he has the tools to succeed against even one of the best defenses in the NFL, which is exactly what the Seahawks are. If Macdonald can contain Stafford as he did in the first matchup, the Seahawks have a chance to win -- even if that's not what happened in that particular game. But if Stafford goes off again as he did in the second matchup, the Seahawks might not get the miracle comeback this time around. Zach Charbonnet injury. The Seahawks will be down a man in the backfield after Charbonnet tore his ACL last week against San Francisco. That leaves Kenneth Walker III as the feature back for Seattle. George Holani could potentially return from injured reserve, but if he doesn't, then it'll be Velus Jones Jr. and Cam Akers working behind Walker. That would likely mean a significant workload for Walker, who has been splitting the snaps and touches with Charbonnet all season. Charbonnet has been the preferred goalline back for Seattle, so it'll be interesting to see whether Walker assumes that role or if it goes to one of the other backs active for the game.Rams running game. Kyren Williams carried the ball 12 times for 91 yards and a touchdown in the first matchup between these two teams. Blake Corum, though, got only 10 yards on his 8 carries. Still, 20 rushes for 101 yards is excellent. Williams and Corum combined for 118 yards on 37 rushing attempts in the second game, though, getting bottled up a little bit more than they did in the first contest. have run for at least 111 yards in each of their two playoff games, but Williams and Corum averaging a combined 4.0 yards per carry, which probably won't cut it against an elite Seattle run defense that held enemy backs to 3.7 yards a pop during the regular season.PredictionI picked the Rams to beat the Seahawks in the NFC title game in our pre-playoff predictions, so I am obviously rolling with the same pick here. L.A. won the first game between these two teams and should have won the second one, and would have if not for one of the craziest two-point conversions anyone has ever seen. The Seahawks have an elite defense and home-field advantage, but when two teams are as close in quality as these two are, I always like to roll with whichever team has the advantage at quarterback, the game's most important position. In this case, that's Matthew Stafford and the Rams. I like them to advance with a closely contested win. \nPick: Rams 23, Seahawks 20\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

The Rams are now headed to the NFC Championship game for the first time since 2021, a season that ended with them winning the Super Bowl. In the NFC title game, the Rams will be heading to Seattle to face the Seahawks for the third time this season. The teams split their two regular-season meetings with the Rams winning in Week 11 (21-19) and the Seahawks winning in Week 16 (38-37). The Seahawks earned their way to the NFC Championship by absolutely destroying the 49ers in a 41-6 win on Saturday night. The Seahawks are in the NFC title game for the first time in 11 years. \n        \n            \n                Prisco's NFL Championship Sunday picks: Jarrett Stidham does enough for Broncos, Seahawks lean on defense\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIn the AFC, the Denver Broncos are headed to the conference title game after beating the Buffalo Bills, 33-30 in overtime, in what was easily the wildest game of the divisional round. The Broncos' vaunted defense forced five turnovers, including four from Josh Allen, who threw two interceptions while also losing two fumbles. The top-seeded Broncos will now host New England in the AFC title game with a trip to Super Bowl LX on the line. The Patriots advanced on Sunday after beating the Texans, 28-16. The Broncos and Patriots are facing each other in the AFC title game for the third time in 13 years. The two previous meetings were both played in Denver and the Broncos won both of them. If the Broncos are going to get to the Super Bowl this year, they're going to have to do it without Bo Nix, who suffered a season-ending ankle injury against Buffalo. For the Patriots, it will mark their first trip to the conference title game since 2018 in what ended up being the final appearance by Tom Brady and Bill Belichick. With that in mind, let's take a look at the full playoff schedule.Divisional Round scheduleSaturday, Jan. 17(1) Broncos 33-30 (OT) over (6) Bills. The Broncos have had one of the best defenses in the NFL all year and Josh Allen found out firsthand why they're so good. The Bills turned the ball over five times with four of those coming from Allen. The Bills QB threw an interception in overtime that set up Denver's game-winning drive. Bo Nix also came up big for the Broncos, throwing for 279 yards and three touchdowns in the win. (1) Seahawks 41-6 over (6) 49ers. Rashid Shaheed returned the opening kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown and this game was essentially over after that. The Seahawks defense absolutely suffocated the 49ers, forcing three turnovers while sacking Brock Purdy twice. They also kept San Francisco out of the end zone for the second straight time after also holding the 49ers without a touchdown in Week 18. With Sam Darnold dealing with an oblique injury, the Seahawks put their offense in the hands of Kenneth Walker, who rushed for 116 yards and three touchdowns. Sunday, Jan. 18(2) Patriots 28-16 over (5) Texans. The Texans' defense was the best in the NFL all season, but it was the Patriots' defense that stole the show in this game. The Patriots forced five turnovers, including a pick-six from Marcus Jones in the second quarter that gave New England an early 14-10 lead. Drake Maye had some fumbling problems, but he also came up with some huge plays, including a 32-yard touchdown pass to Kayshon Boutte in the fourth quarter that iced the win. The Texans are now 0-7 in the divisional round in franchise history and are the only team in the NFL that has yet to make it to the conference title game. (5) Rams 20-17 (OT) over (2) Bears. The Rams pulled off a dramatic win that wasn't decided until Harrison Mevis drilled a 42-yard field goal in overtime. The only reason the game made it to overtime is because Caleb Williams threw a miraculous 14-yard touchdown pass on fourth down with under 30 seconds left to play. The Bears looked like they were going to pull out the win in overtime, but Williams threw an interception that set up the Rams' game-winning drive. Championship SundaySunday, Jan. 25\nAFC ChampionshipPatriots at Broncos, 3 p.m. ET (CBS, Paramount+)NFC ChampionshipRams at Seahawks, 6:30 p.m. ET (Fox; Fubo, try for free)Super Bowl LXSunday, Feb. 8AFC champion vs. NFC champion at Levi's Stadium (Santa Clara, California), 6:30 p.m. ET (NBC)Wild Card resultsSaturday, Jan. 10(5) Rams 34-31 over (4) PanthersRams vs. Panthers recap: The Panthers almost pulled off the upset, but they couldn't stop Matthew Stafford with the game on the line. With the Rams trailing 31-27, Stafford engineered a 71-yard game-winning scoring drive that ended when he hit Colby Parkinson with a 19-yard touchdown with just 38 seconds left to play. Stafford threw for 304 yards and three touchdowns in the win. (2) Bears 31-27 over (7) PackersPackers vs. Bears recap: The Bears pulled off the third-largest fourth-quarter comeback in NFL history. Going into the final quarter, the Bears were trailing by 15 points, but they were able to erase that deficit during a miracle quarter where they outscored the Packers, 25-6. Caleb Williams threw for more yardage (184) in the fourth quarter than he did in the first three quarters combined (177). Williams capped things off with a 25-yard score to DJ Moore with just 1:43 left to win the game. Sunday, Jan. 11(6) Bills 27-24 over (3) JaguarsBills vs. Jaguars recap: For the first time in his career, Josh Allen led a game-winning drive in the fourth quarter of a playoff game. The Bills' franchise quarterback scored the game-winning touchdown on a 1-yard run with just one minute left to play. Allen also threw a 15-yard TD pass in the fourth quarter to help propel Buffalo to the win. Allen totaled 306 yards and three touchdowns in the win. For the Bills, it was their first road playoff win in 33 years. (6) 49ers 23-19 over (3) Eagles49ers vs. Eagles recap: The 49ers pulled off a shocker by going on the road and knocking off the Eagles. After losing George Kittle, the 49ers had some unlikely heroes, including Demarcus Robinson, who caught six passes for 111 yards and a touchdown. Christian McCaffrey also came up big with two touchdowns, including the game-winning score, which came on a 4-yard pass from Brock Purdy with just 2:54 left to play. (2) Patriots 16-3 over (7) ChargersChargers vs. Patriots recap: The Patriots defense took over and carried New England to the win. Justin Herbert was sacked six times as the Patriots kept the Chargers out of the end zone and held them to fewer than 210 total yards.The offense didn't light up the scoreboard, but Drake Maye was impressive in his first career postseason start, throwing for 268 yards and rushing for 66 more. The Patriots are headed to the divisional round for the first time since 2018.Monday, Jan. 12(5) Texans 30-6 over (4) Steelers\nTexans vs. Steelers recap. The Texans had the best defense in the NFL during the regular season, and that unit carried them to a win against Pittsburgh. The Texans defense sacked Aaron Rodgers four times, held the Steelers to just 175 yards and scored two touchdowns, which both came in the fourth quarter. The first one came on a 33-yard fumble return by Sheldon Rankins, and then Calen Bullock followed that up with a 50-yard pick six with just 2:39 left in the game. It was a defensive masterpiece by a Texans team that picked up its first road win in franchise history\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

The promotion begins with Paramount+ on Saturday night in Las Vegas with UFC 324 at the T-Mobile Arena. The main event sees an interim lightweight title fight between Justin Gaethje and Paddy Pimblett.Gaethje, the all-action veteran, has been in this position before. He previously held the interim lightweight title when he defeated Tony Ferguson in 2020. However, he has yet to hold the full championship after suffering defeats against Khabib Nurmagomedov and Charles Oliveira. \"The Highlight\" has managed to stay relevant late in his career, including a second win over Rafael Fiziev in March 2025.Follow live updates on UFC 324: Justin Gaethje vs. Paddy Pimblett as event debuts on Paramount+Pimblett, meanwhile, is a man on the rise as he looks to get his first piece of UFC gold.

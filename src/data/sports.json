New York defeated Memphis, 133-120, on Tuesday at Madison Square Garden. The Knicks are 7-0 at home this season, compared to 0-3 on the road, as they play game six of a seven-game homestand on Wednesday. Jalen Brunson had 32 points and 10 assists on Tuesday, and he's averaging 27.7 points and 6.6 assists per game this season. The Knicks went 3-1 against the Magic last season, with all three of their wins coming by at least nine points, and the model projects that New York's success continues, with the Knicks covering in 67% of simulations.\nGame: Chicago Bulls vs. Detroit Pistons (7 p.m. ET)The Pick: Pistons -2.5 (-110) \"Not a bad price here on the Pistons, who are demonstrating an admirable 'refuse to lose' mode after stretching the current win streak to seven with a wild comeback win in OT over the Wiz on Monday,\" SportsLine legendary expert Bruce Marshall said. \"CJ McCollum (42 points) almost pushed Washington across the line himself, but Cade Cunningham's 46 points saved the night for Detroit.

The pageantry and atmosphere of the game between the two largest service academies are unmatched, which are more incentives for the two meet at the end of the season in a standalone spot. As is the case for some time, when the two teams meet this year on December 13 in Baltimore they will wear special uniforms for the occasion. The Army-Navy game is an opportunity for the two service academies to pay tribute the history of their branch of the armed forces, and the uniforms have become a big part of that. Army unveiled its uniform Wednesday for the 2025 Army-Navy game, which pays tribute to 250 years of service since the Army was founded as the Continental Army in 1775 ahead of the Revolutionary War.\nThe marble coloring of the uniform is a tribute to the headstones for soldiers at Arlington National Cemetery, while a thin purple outline around the numbers honors those who received the Purple Heart. The helmets feature the U.S. Army seal and the Espontoon, representing the Army's role as the \"tip of the spear.\" On the uniforms themselves, players will wear The Great Seal on their shoulders and have nameplates using the Constitution font. \nThis year's Army-Navy game will be a battle between quality teams, as Army is 5-4 on the season and Navy is 7-2 and sits atop the American Conference standings with two games to go before the Black Knights.\n            \n    ",

If Dart cannot go Sunday against the Green Bay Packers, it will be Jameis Winston under center, not Russell Wilson, according to NFL Media. Wilson completed 3 of 7 passes for 45 yards and took two sacks in place of Dart as the Giants blew their fourth double-digit lead of the season to the Chicago Bears. After the Giants fired Brian Daboll, interim coach Mike Kafka made the decision to place Winston over the 36-year-old on the depth chart. Winston has been technically inactive for the entire 2025 season as the Giants' emergency third quarterback. He last played for the Cleveland Browns in 2024, going 2-5 as the starter while throwing for 2,121 yards, 13 touchdowns and 12 interceptions in 12 total games played. Jameis Winston's starts from Weeks 8-15 last seasonNFL RankCompletion percentage62%27thYards per attempt7.219thTurnovers14LastWinston made the Pro Bowl in his first NFL season with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and led the NFL in passing yards in 2019 with 5,109. That was the same year he recorded the first \"30 and 30\" season in NFL history, throwing 33 touchdowns and 30 interceptions. That was his final season in Tampa, as he then made his way to the New Orleans Saints. Winston went 6-4 as the starter in New Orleans over four seasons, as injuries started to affect his availability. Known for his boom-or-bust play, Kafka is hoping he can spark this offense. \nAs for Dart, this is the fourth time the rookie quarterback has been evaluated for a concussion this season. He has gone five straight games with a rushing touchdown, and is the fifth quarterback since 1970 to average 200 passing yards per game and 40 rushing yards per game in his first seven career starts. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        With Major League Baseball's free agency period opening last week, teams are now in the clear to pursue upgrades to their roster as they see fit. Yet teams will have to wait a little longer before they can chase after some of the most interesting free agents in this winter's class. Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball league and South Korea's Korea Baseball Organization have arrangements in place with MLB wherein their teams post players for MLB consideration. Typically, that process tends to start a little later in the winter.\n        \n            \n                Ranking top 50 MLB free agents for 2026: Kyle Tucker, Alex Bregman at top, plus landing spots for every player\n                \n                    R.J. Anderson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLook no farther than the World Series champions, the Los Angeles Dodgers, to see how important international talent can be to a club. The Dodgers employed four different former NPB and KBO players this year, including two-way star Shohei Ohtani, ace Yoshinobu Yamamoto, and closer Roki Sasaki. Ohtani was signed as an MLB free agent, but the others came through the posting system.There are no Ohtanis or Yamamotos available in this winter's international free agent crop. There are, however, some interesting talents who should improve an MLB roster as soon as next spring. Below, CBS Sports has highlighted four players in particular worth knowing.\n1. 3B/1B Munetaka MurakamiTop 50 ranking: No. 7Potential suitors: Yankees, Mets, DodgersMurakami, 26 in February, is the most famous player of the bunch. He's only a few years removed from breaking Sadaharu Oh's NPB single-season home-run record for a Japanese-born player. Sure enough, Murakami has elite strength that will play on either side of the Pacific. Other facets of his game aren't as certain to port. He swings and misses a lot, resulting in one of the highest strikeout rates (around 28%) among NPB regulars. (NPB hasn't experienced the same strikeout creep as MLB.) Additionally, Murakami isn't much of a defensive presence and he may find himself stationed at either first base or designated hitter in the near future. Some team is going to fall for Murakami, and hard, because of his middle-of-the-order upside and youth. Just be aware that there is a legitimate downside here. Murakami, who was officially posted last week, will have until Dec. 22 to sign with an MLB team.2. RHP Tatsuya ImaiTop 50 ranking: No. 12Potential suitors: Yankees, Mets, CubsImai is the most interesting incoming pitcher. He's a shorter right-hander with a low release point from which he fires mid-90s fastballs and a forkball-like slider. Imai has battled his command throughout his career (he didn't walk fewer than four batters per nine innings until his seventh professional season), yet the 27 year old profiles as at least a mid-rotation starter for as long as he throws strikes. He's coming off a season that saw him deliver a 1.92 ERA and a 3.96 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 163 innings. Unlike with NPB hitters, NPB pitchers are viewed as safer bets -- that's even with the differences in MLB's ball and throwing schedule. The Saitama Seibu Lionss posted him earlier this week.3. 3B/1B/OF Kazuma OkamotoTop 50 ranking: No. 22Potential suitors: Mariners, Red Sox, MetsBelieve it or not, there are statistical models that favor Okamoto's chances of succeeding against MLB pitching to Murakami's. At minimum, Okamoto has, to his credit, done a better job than Murakami at keeping his swing-and-miss and strikeout rates in check. To his debt, he's a few years older (30 next June) and he's a right-handed hitter. Okamoto's market may be dictated by how teams feel about his defense at the hot corner. Should they deem him unfit there, there will be more pressure on his bat.\n4. RHP Cody PonceTop 50 ranking: No. 44Potential suitors: Padres, Mets, CardinalsYou may remember Ponce from 20 scattered appearances he made with the Pittsburgh Pirates a few years back. If not, don't worry about it. Now 31, he completely overhauled his game during a stint in South Korea, adding velocity (he can now touch into the upper-90s) and forging a swing-and-miss splitter. Merrill Kelly, Erick Fedde, and even Chris Flexen are recent examples of pitchers returning from the KBO to find success (if at times short-lived) in MLB. Ponce should do the same.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Portland will try to snap a two-game losing streak when it travels to New Orleans on Wednesday night, and the performance of Trail Blazers small forward Deni Avdija will be a key factor in the outcome. Avdija is averaging 25.5 points, 6.8 rebounds and 4.9 assists per game this season, playing at least 35 minutes in four straight games. He was one of the league's top rebounders down the stretch last season, but his slow rebounding start to the year has contributed to a low total in the Wednesday NBA odds. SportsLine's proven computer model and Inside the Lines team are backing the Over (7.5) for Avdija with their Wednesday NBA best bets.

Maybe the bright lights of NY were too bright. Coward was shooting 44% from 3pt range before that game,\" SportsLine senior data analyst Stephen Oh said. \"The positives from yesterday was he played 30 minutes (2nd most of his rookie season), stuffed the stat sheet defensively (2 steals, 2 blocks), had 8 REB+AST and got to the line (6/6 on free throws). A little regression to the mean from 3pt range vs a Boston team that is playing back-to-back as well and has NOT been defending the three well at home this season (allow 39% vs just 35% last season).\"Bet on Coward with the latest DraftKings promo code, which gives new users $300 in bonus bets if their first $5 wager wins and three months free NBA League Pass:Deni Avdija, Trail Blazers, Over 7.5 rebounds (+105) \"Avdija ended '24-25 as a monster 12+ rebound per game player. The Pelicans have been getting demolished on the boards by 4 per game and especially at home with a ridiculous -14 per game in 3 games. Avdija started the season with 4 straight under 7.5 rebound games and 6 of his first 7. As a result his line is down to 7.5 heavily juiced under,\" Oh said. \"I think if he came in with his recent 2-1 over stretch with 11 and 10 rebound games the line would be set at 8.5 juiced over or even 9.5 rebounds. We are projecting him for 8.3 rebounds and would charge -125 for over 7.5 boards.\"Bet on Avdija with the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: Mark Williams, Suns, Over 12.5 points (-118)\"Anthony Davis may or may not be back but even if he's back I doubt he'll be in dominant form. He looks kind of heavy and not particularly motivated with the Mavs off to a bad start. The Suns on the other hand have been a very pleasant over .500 surprise and Mark Williams has provided 4 double doubles in his last 8 games,\" Oh said. \"We are getting a buy low spot because he only had 2 points in his last outing in just 20 minutes. But that was a game where the Suns dominated and won by 23 points. Mark Williams is very injury prone, enough to rescind last season's trade to the Lakers. The Suns won't play him in any garbage time situation where he's not needed. But when he is needed he scores plenty. Since last season he has actually averaged a ton more (17) on the road than at home (12.4) and his over is 19-7, 73% on the road (just 11-17 at home). Prior to his 2 pt outing he came in 5-2 over this line.\"Bet on Williams with the latest BetMGM promo code, which gives new users up to $1,500 back in bonus bets if your first bet loses: Want more Wednesday NBA picks?You've seen the model's NBA picks for some popular NBA player props for Wednesday.

    "body": "\n        The first-round College Football Playoff bye is a cake-topper all national championship contenders covet this time of year. The extra prep time didn't help reigning SEC champion Georgia last season after falling to Notre Dame in the quarterfinals, but this time around, it's an opportunity that could resurface should the No. 5 Bulldogs win out.That begins with Saturday's showdown against No. 10 Texas, which has four won straight SEC games to stay in the playoff picture. A home date with Charlotte follows for Georgia before the rivalry weekend finale against Georgia Tech, the frontrunners in the ACC.The Bulldogs stayed at No. 5 in this week's updated playoff rankings following last weekend's victory at Mississippi State after the four teams ahead of Georgia -- Ohio State, Indiana, Texas A&M and Alabama -- also won.\n        \n            \n                College Football Playoff Rankings: Ohio State holds at No. 1 as Texas Tech jumps Ole Miss in top 25\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nGeorgia's strength of record currently sits at No. 5 nationally and third in the SEC behind the Aggies (No. 1) and Crimson Tide (No. 4). The Bulldogs are also 14th in game control and 11th in overall strength of schedule, enhanced metrics that all have a chance at improving if Georgia runs the table.\nThe committee's new metric -- record strength -- measures how well a team performs against its schedule relative to quality of opponents. And with Texas and potential ACC champion Georgia Tech left on the docket for the Bulldogs, this should be beneficial in final discussions.\"We looked at Georgia, and again, really good football team,\" committee chair Mack Rhoades said after the first playoff rankings. \"I think Gunner Stockton at quarterback has really progressed. It certainly feels like they have more confidence in him, doing a lot more with him. Again, he's another maybe similar to (Texas A&M quarterback) Marcel Reed where he can beat you with his arm, he can beat you with his feet.\"The head-to-head against Ole Miss, obviously we took that into account. We absolutely took into account the loss at home versus Alabama. But Georgia is a really, really good football team.\"\nPotential playoff seeding scenarios if Georgia wins outTexas A&M (12-0) vs. Alabama (11-1) in SEC Championship Game with Aggies winning: The committee's deliberations come down to a two-loss Alabama against one-loss Georgia for a top-4 seed with the Crimson Tide's head-to-head win over the Bulldogs on Sept. 27 coming into play if margins are even.Texas A&M (12-0) vs. Alabama (11-1) in SEC Championship Game with Crimson Tide winning: Alabama's locked into a first-round bye with the committee then deciding between the Aggies and Bulldogs. At 12 wins overall following its perfect regular season, Texas A&M would be the likely pick.Georgia (11-1) vs. Alabama (11-1) in SEC Championship Game with Georgia winning: This is the obvious ideal scenario for the Bulldogs and all that is needed would be a Texas win over Texas A&M in the regular-season finale. That would create a three-team tie for second in the conference, but sends Georgia to Atlanta over fellow one-loss teams Texas A&M and Ole Miss based on conference opponent winning percentage. The Bulldogs beat the Rebels head-to-head and would have a win over the team Texas A&M lost to in terms of common opponents -- Texas.No. 4 Alabama's home showdown with No. 11 Oklahoma this weekend is one that should be on Georgia's radar as well. If the Sooners go into Tuscaloosa and win, this throws a wrench in the SEC playoff picture and puts Georgia in the top-4 playoff mix. Alabama would still reach the SEC Championship to play Texas A&M as long as it beats Auburn, but it would be hard for the committee to justify a potential three-loss Crimson Tide team over Georgia inside the top 4 if they went on to lose to the Aggies during conference championship weekend.Last season, CFP executive director Rich Clark and the committee suggested conference championship game results are not supposed to alter seeding for the loser. However, it must be added to the scope of team-by-team evaluations.Would the committee really put Alabama (10-3) inside the top 4 over Georgia (11-1) if those are the final records when the dust settles?\nIn short, Georgia must beat Texas, Charlotte and Georgia Tech to be in the first-round bye conversation, then hope for another Alabama loss or Texas A&M loss to Texas in the regular-season finale to have a legitimate shot.Avoiding scoreboard watching and focusing on the task at hand, the Bulldogs can only do so much -- and that's accomplishing the first leg this weekend with a win over the Longhorns. For now, Smart said his team's not caught up in the rankings or various talking points down the stretch.\"I do know that it'll take care of itself if you handle your business, and if you don't, you'll be worried about a lot of those things,\" Smart said during last week's SEC teleconference. \"That's just the state of college football and where it is.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        This is an article version of the CBS Sports HQ AM Newsletter, the ultimate guide to every day in sports. You can sign up to get it in your inbox every weekday morning here. \nGood morning and happy hump day, sports fans! It's Austin Nivison greeting you on this Wednesday, and there's no need to waste any time with so much news around the sports world. The Mavericks finally fired general manager Nico Harrison, Texas Tech was a big winner in the latest College Football Playoff rankings and the Jaguars suffered a big loss. Let's get right to it.  🏀 Five things to know Wednesday The Mavericks fired embattled GM Nico Harrison. Less than one year after trading Luka Dončić to the Lakers in one of the most universally panned deals in NBA history, Harrison was shown the door. While the Dončić deal may have been the final straw -- and the spark for many \"Fire Nico\" chants -- a series of key departures ultimately sealed Harrison's fate. Looking ahead, here are some candidates who could replace Harrison in Dallas.Jaguars rookie Travis Hunter underwent season-ending knee surgery. The No. 2 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, Hunter seemed to be finding his footing as he attempted to play both ways at the NFL level. However, the Jaguars placed him on IR on Halloween, and Hunter's rookie campaign has now been cut short following knee surgery. On offense, he caught 28 passes for 298 yards and one touchdown.Texas Tech jumped Oregon and Ole Miss in latest College Football Playoff rankings. Apparently, the Red Raiders impressed the selection committee with their 29-7 thumping of formerly No. 7 BYU (8-1). That win helped Texas Tech (9-1) fly like a tortilla at Jones AT&T Stadium up to No. 6, and now it's poised to host a first-round game. Be sure to check out the complete rankings, in which Ohio State (9-0) held steady at No. 1 as its undefeated season rolls on. BYU falls seven spots to No. 12.No. 12 Louisville downed No. 9 Kentucky in early-season rivalry clash. In a Bluegrass State showdown, the Cardinals scored a massive 96-88 victory as they simply played a cleaner game (six more assists and eight fewer turnovers) than the Wildcats. Mikel Brown Jr. paced Louisville with 29 points and five assists. This one will sting for Kentucky, but might there be a rematch in March?The Steelers signed CB Asante Samuel Jr. Now cleared for football activities, Samuel is joining a Steelers defense in need of secondary help. Samuel underwent spinal fusion surgery in April, and he has nearly completed his recovery. It's tough to know exactly what to expect from Samuel, but he gives Pittsburgh much-needed depth at the position with injuries to Darius Slay and safety DeShon Elliott, which prompted Jalen Ramsey's move to safety. 🏈 Do not miss this: Major movement in Pete Prisco's NFL Power Rankings \n                                                                    Imagn Images\n                                                            The NFL once again proved just how unpredictable it can be this past weekend, and that caused a major shakeup in the latest edition of Pete Prisco's NFL Power Rankings. Each of the top nine teams moved in one direction or another from last week. In Week 10, there were a many positives to highlight. Drake Maye looks like an MVP candidate, and the Patriots look like real contenders. The Lions went back to lighting up the scoreboard like a Christmas tree with Dan Campbell calling plays. Both teams were among the notable risers. \nBut what about the teams that were surprising for other reasons? The Bills tumbled six spots after an embarrassing loss to the Dolphins, and they may have one fatal flaw. Prisco: \"The letdown after beating the Chiefs turned into a disaster in Miami. If you can't stop the run, and they can't, you can't win a Super Bowl. That has to be fixed.\"Because I'm such a nice guy, I'll give you all a tease of the top 10 with the shifts the order: 6. Buccaneers (-5) 7. Lions (+4) 8. Bills (-6) 9. Broncos (-1) 10. Chiefs (--)  📉 College Football Playoff Rankings: No. 15 Miami still in trouble \n                                                                    Imagn Images\n                                                            If you tuned into the CFP Rankings show last night, you saw Miami as the highest-ranked team in the ACC. You also saw the Hurricanes projected in the 12-team playoff bracket. So, they must be in a great spot to reach the playoff, right? Not so fast, my friend. \nDespite a decent playoff resume, which includes wins over No. 10 Notre Dame, No. 25 USF and Florida, Miami has next to no chance of winning the ACC. Thanks to befuddling losses against No. 20 Louisville and unranked SMU, the Hurricanes are 3-2 in conference play ... good for seventh place. As Shehean Jeyarajah explains, the Hurricanes' non-existent path to the ACC Championship Game means they may very well miss the playoff altogether, despite their current ranking. Jeyarajah: \"SportsLine projections do give Miami a 12.7% chance to make the College Football Playoff, which is fourth in the ACC. That projection primarily leans on them as an at-large team. The Hurricanes should finish the season 10-2 with a road win against No. 22 Pittsburgh, which would give them a fairly strong resume. Miami would need plenty of help, but a bid for the Hurricanes isn't completely off the table.\" The best (and not-so-best) of the rest \n                                                                    Imagn Images\n                                                            Rookie VJ Edgecombe has already breathed new life into the 76ers.Now the bad news in Philly: Joel Embiid will have to undergo further evaluation for knee soreness.Matt LaFleur isn't worried about hot seat talk after back-to-back losses.New Eagles CB Jaire Alexander is contemplating retirement after the trade.Cowboys owner Jerry Jones was \"devastated\" by the loss of Marshawn Kneeland.These 10 games could shape the home stretch of the 2025 NFL season.Bungling in Baton Rouge?

    "body": "\n        CHAMPAIGN, Il. — Brad Underwood may have preferred a postgame shot and a beer after his 14th-ranked Illini outlasted No. 11 Texas Tech, 81-77, but he had to settle for popcorn (his usual) and cough drops ('tis the season). That might not be an ideal combination, but the Andrej Stojakovic and Kylan Boswell pairing sure might be. Texas Tech All-American JT Toppin may have been the best player on the floor, but the offices of Stojakovic & Boswell thrived in its first true test of the 2025-26 campaign. Boswell poured in 22 points, but it was his defense that proved to be the story of the game. He turned off Texas Tech star point guard Christian Anderson's water before pivoting to fronting, grappling and tangling with Toppin, who had blowtorched anyone and everyone in the first six-plus minutes of the second half to erase Illinois' 13-point halftime advantage. Not to be outdone, Stojakovic deposited a team-high 23 points in 26 minutes off the bench, but he saved the day with a game-sealing block on Anderson's game-tying 3-pointer in the closing seconds. It drew a roar from his dad, Peja, who was dialed into the proceedings from his perch in the lower bowl of the State Farm Center.Nights like Tuesday had to be what Boswell was envisioning when he was blowing up Stojakovic's phone last April, when the Cal transfer hit the market.\n\"I was just calling this dude, bugging this kid,\" Boswell said. \"He was one of my favorite players that I was watching throughout the summer. I'm really excited that he got here. Big shoutout to me for doing that.\"Visions of nights like Tuesday just had to emerge in the nightly banter when Stojakovic took Boswell to his home country, Greece, this summer for a vacation.Nights like Tuesday can also reinforce Underwood's belief that the Illini have righted the wrongs that kept a talented team from coalescing into a great team a year ago.\nIllinois' formula emergesChampionships aren't won in mid-November, but Illinois showed a recipe Tuesday that is both tantalizing and repeatable. Illinois didn't have All-Big Ten center Tomislav Ivisic (knee sprain), didn't make a single 3-pointer in the second half, and yet still managed a respectable 1.19 points per possession offensively and won the battle on the boards.Illinois has seemingly made real changes before the rash of New Year's Resolutions. These Illini have traded a barrage of stepback triples for a paint-centered lifestyle. It's helped the Illini avoid the stagnant pitfalls that befell them at inopportune times in the past. Illinois scored 42 points in the paint against Texas Tech, shot 23 free throws and ripped down 11 offensive rebounds, including five by steady freshman Keaton Wagler.\"I can't name another freshman wing that is doing that,\" Stojakovic said. \"I'm very proud of him.\"\nThat's good math.The defense had to take real, tangible strides as well.Underwood, yet again, petitioned for Boswell to be regarded as one of the nation's top defenders — Boswell was featured in CBS Sports' Top Defenders rundown — but he can't do it alone. \nBoswell has been weaponized by real defensive tweaks, and Stojakovic may have delivered the best defensive game of his career on Tuesday, despite missing seven weeks in the preseason due to a knee sprain. Stojakovic shifted onto Anderson and used his length to wreak havoc, which allowed Boswell to take the Toppin assignment. \"(Stojakovic) doesn't need to score big every single night for us to win and be a great offensive player, but he does have to guard,\" Underwood said. \"That's the part I missed the most is those seven weeks I didn't get screaming and barking at him to guard.\nConsistency will be the name of the game, but all of a sudden, Underwood has three big, sturdy guards in Boswell, Stojakovic and Wagler who can play some defense paired with a massive frontcourt, anchored by Zvonimir Ivisic. Tomislav's twin brother is on pace to post the best shot-blocking numbers of any Illinois player in the modern era after swatting away three more shots on Tuesday.Toss in new defensive coordinator Camryn Crocker, who threw a galore of changeups at Texas Tech in the quest for stops, and there's optimism that this defense can take a step forward from a unit that ranked 40th nationally in efficiency. Toppin delivered a 35-point haymaker, but the Illini won the war with a defense that tried not to foul (six free throw attempts), limited transition (six transition points allowed) and mostly blanketed the 3-point stripe (just 22 of Texas Tech's 64 shots were from downtown).\"We're cerebral,\" Underwood said. \"That's where our freshmen have been huge. Understanding the communication part of it, that's where we're continuing to grow. That's what I've been worried most about Andrej. The (defensive) end of the court. I'm relatively pleased. We've had good halves. I felt like we've followed the game plan pretty close to a T tonight. I wouldn't have envisioned (Toppin) getting 35, I would've envisioned 20 or 25 because he's going to get that every night that he's not in foul trouble. But really pleased.\"\nWhere can this go?Embellishment after a home win in mid-November is never ideal, especially with the Illini's dates against Alabama, UConn and Tennessee looming in the next three-and-a-half weeks. But it's hard to walk out of the State Farm Center and find a real hotspot that could derail this Illini roster.Tomislav Ivisic is the best player on this team, and the Stojakovic-Boswell pairing is rocking and rolling already. The brute-force size, shooting, slashing, perimeter defense and rim protection are all encouraging. Plus, the freshmen are way ahead of the curve. Fellow freshman forward David Mirkovic was far from perfect Tuesday, but he still posted 11 points and whipped a clutch dime to Boswell for a layup with 26 ticks left in regulation. Wagler (11 points, seven rebounds) has drawn rave reviews all summer, and that was echoed by his teammates, Texas Tech coach Grant McCasland, and even has NBA Draft scouts buzzing. \"He's very calm as a freshman, very poised,\" Stojakovic said. \"He's so talented, and he doesn't even know yet. Trying to help him understand what he can mean to this team later on this year. We knew he was going to be good. Ever since the season started, just the rest of the world is seeing him now.\"\nThis is what the bones of a contender look like, and Underwood appears to know it.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        UConn quarterback Joe Fagnano accomplished something last week that no college passer had done since 2019, leading the Huskies to a 37-34 win over Duke. For the fifth consecutive game, he surpassed 250 passing yards while throwing at least three touchdowns without an interception.The last player to do that? Joe Burrow at LSU. That's elite company for Fagnano, who enters this week's matchup with Air Force having thrown 25 touchdown passes with no interceptions. Thanks largely to his prolific production, UConn has a chance to reach 10 wins for the first time as an FBS program.Fagnano isn't the only quarterback from outside the Power Four on the rise this week. American Conference standouts Jake Retzlaff of Tulane and Byrum Brown of South Florida both surged into the top 10 after prolific showings in must-win games. Not far behind is James Madison's Alonza Barnett, who checks in at No. 12 following another strong outing for the Dukes.These rankings are not a Heisman forecast, draft projection or season-long outlook. They're a real-time evaluation of performance, factoring in competition, pressure and production. With that, here are this week's power rankings of college football's top 50 quarterbacks.\n1. Joe Fagnano, UConnFagnano became the third college quarterback in 25 years to reach 25 touchdown passes without an interception last week as he led UConn to a 37-34 win over Duke. The veteran Maine transfer is the first quarterback since Joe Burrow to have 250-plus passing yards, three or more passing touchdowns and no interceptions in five straight games. Last week: 102. Julian Sayin, Ohio StateSayin's 27 of 33 performance in Ohio State's easy win over Purdue constituted another strong outing from the redshirt freshman. His only blemish was an unseemly interception in the end zone that he'd love to have back. Sayin's 80.9% completion mark leads the nation by a wide margin. Last week: 13. Haynes King, Georgia TechGeorgia Tech is coming off a bye, which is huge for King. Few quarterbacks take more hits than the veteran Texas A&M transfer. His 14 rushing touchdowns are second nationally, but King can sling it also. He topped 400 yards passing in a loss at NC State to start November. Last week: 2\n4. Fernando Mendoza, IndianaMendoza threw a bad interception that set Penn State up for a go-ahead touchdown in the fourth quarter. The redemption that followed was spectacular. The Cal transfer led an 80-yard touchdown drive in the final two minutes -- highlighted by a couple of ridiculous catches -- to keep Indiana undefeated. Last week: 35. Ty Simpson, AlabamaSimpson didn't have his best stuff in Alabama's 20-9 win over LSU, but he had enough. The Crimson Tide's redshirt junior hit Isaiah Horton for an important 21-yard gain with under seven minutes remaining to set Bama up for a field goal that made it a two-possession game. He still hasn't been intercepted since the season opener. Last week: 56. Jake Retzlaff, TulaneRetzlaff carried Tulane to a critical 38-32 win at Memphis with a legendary heater. The BYU transfer hit 16 of 17 passes to start the game, and his only incompletion in that stretch was a bad drop. He couldn't miss as the Green Wave built an insurmountable lead and kept their American title hopes alive. Last week: unranked\n7. Byrum Brown, South FloridaBrown put on an absolute clinic in South Florida's 55-23 romp over UTSA. He hit all nine of his pass attempts in the first half for 175 yards and two touchdowns as the Bulls built a 42-10 lead. He also finished with 109 yards rushing and a touchdown. Brown is fourth nationally in total offense per game at 323.1 yards. Last week: 168. Mason Heintschel, PittHeintschel is 5-0 as Pitt's starter and has put up prolific numbers, especially for a true freshman. But the five wins came against lackluster opposition, and things are about to get real. The No. 23 Panthers host Notre Dame this week before closing at Georgia Tech and against Miami. If Heintschel can shred the Fighting Irish, his fame will proliferate quickly. Last week: 79. Diego Pavia, VanderbiltPavia accounted for 489 of Vanderbilt's 544 yards in a 45-38 overtime victory over Auburn. His 377 yards passing marked a career-high, and Pavia's 112 rushing yards were his most in a game at Vanderbilt. He will likely surpass Jay Cutler's school record for total offense in a season when Vanderbilt hosts Kentucky next week. Last week: 11\n10. Marcel Reed, Texas A&MReed navigated Texas A&M's odd stretch of three straight SEC road games with a smooth touch, totaling 10 touchdowns while helping the Aggies reach 9-0. The Aggies have surrendered an SEC-low eight sacks this season, which is a testament to Reed's awareness and elusiveness. Last week: 811. CJ Bailey, NC StateBailey and the Wolfpack are headed to face Miami after a bye week. The Hurricanes should be on high alert after he torched previously unbeaten Georgia Tech with 340 yards passing last time out. It was just the latest big moment in a breakout sophomore season for the rising star QB. NFL scouts are taking notice of this tall and seemingly unflappable QB with a 70.7% completion rate. Last week: 612. Alonza Barnett, James MadisonBarnett is tied for the Sun Belt lead in rushing touchdowns with 10 and is third in the league with 16 passing touchdowns. Of the seven Sun Belt quarterbacks with at least 200 pass attempts, he's the only one with fewer than five interceptions. As a result, James Madison has an outside shot at making the CFP. Last week: 13\n13. Gunner Stockton, GeorgiaStockton's 157.12 pass efficiency in league games is best among all SEC quarterbacks. His 69.5% completion mark in conference action also tops the charts. In case you're not sold on his passing proficiency, Stockton also leads Georgia in rushing touchdowns with seven. Last week: 1714. Luke Altymer, IllinoisPrior to Illinois' bye week, Altymer returned to form with five total touchdowns in a drubbing of Rutgers. His four passing scores tied a career-high, and his 88 rushing yards were the most he's had in a game in over two years. With three games against poor opposition remaining, he's on track to set career highs in passing yards and passing touchdowns. Last week: 1415. Trinidad Chambliss, Ole MissIf you factor out Chambliss' two garbage time appearances from before he won the starting job, he's leading the nation in total offense. The Division II transfer is totaling 338.8 yards per game in his eight starts and has Ole Miss on the cusp of its first-ever CFP appearance. Last week: 15\n16. CJ Carr, Notre DameCarr will be draft eligible after the 2026 season. But if the redshirt freshman sticks around through 2027 or 2028, he could go down as one of the all-time great Notre Dame quarterbacks. He's thrown 19 touchdowns with just four interceptions over his first nine games as the Fighting Irish's starter. Last week: 2317. Jayden Maiava, USCMaiava totaled three touchdowns in USC's 38-17 win over Northwestern, successfully turning the page from a couple of substandard performances. He ranks second in the Big Ten in passing yards and yards per attempt. He also leads the Trojans in rushing touchdowns with six. Last week: 25 18. Arch Manning, TexasManning climbed his way from outside the top 50 back into a prominent spot with consecutive 300-plus yard, three-touchdown performances in critical SEC victories. Coming off a bye, he heads to Georgia for a showcase opportunity that may serve as the ultimate verdict on his 2025 season. Last week: 18\n19. Bear Bachmeier, BYUBachmeier and BYU didn't have their best stuff in a road loss against Texas Tech. But one disappointing game isn't enough to totally tank his standing in the quarterback power rankings. The true freshman has been a star for the Cougars, who are still in the Big 12 title hunt and CFP race. Last week: 920. Sawyer Robertson, BaylorRobertson finally relinquished the national lead in passing yards during Baylor's bye week. But he's tied for first in passing touchdowns with 26, and his 2,780 yards passing are tops in the Big 12. If the Bears make a bowl, it's feasible that he could reach 4,000 yards through the air. Last week: 2021. Dante Moore, OregonLast week: 1222. Darian Mensah, DukeLast week: 423. Noah Fifita, ArizonaLast week: 3324. Drew Mestemaker, North TexasLast week: 2425.

In New York, the show is scheduled to air after the Jets-Ravens game, at approximately 5 p.m., but viewers are being advised to check their local listings for the exact air time in their region. The show will take a look back on the top moments from the year, along with a preview of the Mubadala Abu Dhabi Sail Grand Prix Season 2025 Grand Final that will be held Nov 29-30.The aim of the Rolex SailGP Championship has been to redefine the sport of sailing by bringing the action closer to the shore so that fans can experience the thrill of seeing the massive 50-foot foiling catamarans whiz by at speeds exceeding 60 miles per hour. \nThe show will be the sailing fan's ultimate guide to the season thus far and will spotlight the world's best athletes across four continents. Some footage shown will include the U.S. SailGP Team making the podium in Dubai, ROCKWOOL Denmark breaking the SailGP speed record, and crashes and collapses on the water. Interviews with the U.S. SailGP team and commentary from all event winners will also be part of the broadcast.The Grand Final event, which will consist of two days of 12-boat fleet races, is scheduled for next weekend. Points earned during the preliminary races will determine the three teams to advance to final race, a single, winner-take-all showdown -- and the $2 million prize, the largest in the sport, that will go to the champions. \nThe top three national teams on the leaderboard are Emirates representing Great Britain, the Black Foils of New Zealand and the BONDS Flying Roos out of Australia. However, do not discount last year's winners, Spain's Los Gallos. \n            \n    ",

DeMarco will remain on the bench for the Warriors for the time being, and it has not yet been determined when he will make the switch to working solely with the Liberty.DeMarco, who has been with the Warriors since 2012, helped the franchise win four NBA titles and is regarded as a defensive specialist. He has also served as the head coach for the Bahamas men's national basketball team since 2019. Liberty star Sabrina Ionescu reached out to Warriors star Steph Curry during this process to get his thoughts on DeMarco, per ESPN.The Liberty won the first title in franchise history in 2024, and got off to a 9-0 start last season. Injuries eventually derailed their campaign, however, and they were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Mercury. Days after their Game 3 defeat, the Liberty announced that Brondello would not return as coach. During Brondello's four seasons in charge, the Liberty went 107-53, won a franchise-record 32 games in both 2023 and 2024, never missed the playoffs and made two Finals appearances. In addition to their 2024 WNBA championship, Brondello also captured the Commissioner's Cup title in 2023.\nDespite all of Brondello's success, general manager Jonathan Kolb and the Liberty's brain trust felt it was necessary to go in a different direction to get the most out of their championship window. \"Coming out of this season and really seeing an influx of change on many teams, it made the decision timeline tangible and one that we can be actionable on,\" Kolb said during his exit interview about the decision to move on from Brondello. \"You can stand still or you can embrace change and move forward. My commitment is to keep pushing the New York Liberty to new heights. We believe that embracing this change will bring a freshness and an energy to our group.\"\nThe Liberty only have two players under contract for 2026 -- Leonie Fiebich and Nyara Sabally -- and like every team in the league face a fascinating offseason. Breanna Stewart, Ionescu and Jonquel Jones have all expressed a desire to return, but it remains to be seen how free agency will work after a new collective bargaining agreement is ratified. In addition to trying to re-sign their Big Three, the Liberty will have big decisions to make about Natasha Cloud and Emma Meesseman. \n            \n    ",

Aiyuk was expected to return to the field at some point this season after recovering from a devastating knee injury suffered last year, but as the season starts to wind down, things have only gotten more murky.According to ESPN and The Athletic, San Francisco voided Aiyuk's guaranteed money for the 2026 season during training camp for not meeting the requirements of his contract extensions signed in August 2024, worth $120 million over four years. Aiyuk's contract included an option bonus worth $24.935 million, which originally became guaranteed on April 1, but is now void. It's unclear if the 49ers will pay his $1.215 million base salary and bonuses for workouts and per-game appearances. Aiyuk has been missing from the gridiron since suffering a right knee injury in October 2024. He tore his ACL, MCL and meniscus against the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 7 last season. The team had initially hoped to get him back to practice around midseason. however, the clock is winding down with six regular-season games left.\n\"Brandon's just  week-to-week,\" Niners coach Kyle Shanahan told reporters on Monday. \"When he had such a big  injury like that,  just waiting until he is fully comfortable to come up  and start  practicing.\" \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Survivor Series: WarGames has a blockbuster main event. The WarGames stipulation returns for the fourth consecutive year with CM Punk, Roman Reigns, Cody Rhodes, Jey Uso, Brock Lesnar and Logan Paul in the mix.Since 2022, WWE has replaced the traditional four vs. four or five vs. five Survivor Series matches with WarGames, a legendary stipulation invented by \"The American Dream\" Dusty Rhodes. This year, world heavyweight champion Punk teams with Rhodes, Reigns and others to take on The Vision and their loose allies. Survivor Series also features the penultimate stop in John Cena's retirement tour. The new intercontinental champion will grant Dominik Mysterio a rematch before turning his attention to the winner of The Last Time is Now tournament.Take a look below at the confirmed matches for Survivor Series and take a glance at the crystal ball of what may come. The event streams live on ESPN Unlimited starting at 6:30 p.m. ET.\n2025 WWE Survivor Series matchesCM Punk, Cody Rhodes, The Usos (Jey Uso & Jimmy Uso) and Roman Reigns vs. The Vision (Bron Breakker, Bronson Reed & Logan Paul), Drew McIntyre and Brock Lesnar (WarGames match): Survivor Series' main event must have taken a turn after Seth Rollins suffered an injury at Crown Jewel. The Vision now moves on without him, forming an alliance with Logan Paul in the process. On Nov. 14, McIntyre joined The Vision's team to circumvent a suspension handed to him by SmackDown general manager Nick Aldis. The final spots on each team were claimed by Lesnar, siding with Heyman's group, and Reigns reuniting with his cousins.Rhea Ripley, Iyo Sky, Alexa Bliss, Charlotte Flair and AJ Lee vs. Nia Jax, Lash Legend, The Kabuki Warriors (Asuka & Kari Sane) and Becky Lynch: Multiple rivalries come to a head in this year's women's WarGames match. Ripley and Sky have been feuding with the Kabuki Warriors. WWE women's tag team champions Bliss and Flair have sparked up a fresh rivalry with the new tandem of Jax and Lash. After the match was booked, Flair exited her team, claiming she couldn't trust Ripley. That leaves two spots to fill on Ripley's team, and one for Jax's. Flair and Ripley eventually patched things up, bolstering their ranks with Lee, while Jax and company enlisted Lynch.Intercontinental Championship -- John Cena (c) vs. Dominik Mysterio: Cena is a first-ballot Hall of Famer, and the first 17-time world champion recognized by WWE, but until recently, he was not a Grand Slam champion. That's because the intercontinental title has surprisingly eluded him for two decades. On Nov. 10, Cena defeated Mysterio in an impromptu match for the intercontinental title. They will have their rematch at Survivor Series.\nWomen's World Championship -- Stephanie Vaquer (c) vs. Nikki Bella: Bella is going nowhere. Three months after a failed bid for the women's intercontinental title, Bella struck Vaquer from behind. Her villainous turn sets the stage for Vaquer's next title defense at a cornerstone WWE pay-per-view.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Mikel Arteta has insisted that Arsenal can weather the storm of \"weeks\" without their defensive leader Gabriel as injuries threaten to derail the Gunners ahead of a pivotal week.Gabriel injured his thigh in Brazil's 2-0 win over Senegal on Saturday and is due for further scans on Wednesday as Arsenal look to ascertain a clearer timescale on the recovery of their defensive leader. Initial fears pegged the 27 year old as facing up to two months on the sidelines but for the time being Arteta remains reluctant to offer further clarity.\"He's going to be out for weeks,\" said Arteta. \"We need to have another scan and we'll have the timeline much clearer than we have at the moment. It's clearly a blow, it's our leader in our backline. It's never a positive thing to lose him. The good thing is we have very good options and people have to stand up now and do the job.\"To complicate matters further Riccardo Calafiori remains a doubt for Sunday's north London derby having missed training during the international break. The Italian national team sent Calafiori back to Arsenal after initial tests on his thigh injury and Arteta revealed that the 23-year-old, an ever present in his Premier League XIs this season, had been playing through pain.\n\"He's been carrying a few things and we had to bring him back. He hasn't trained yet. Tomorrow we have another training session, let's see how he is.\"The injuries to the Arsenal backline are all the more frustratingly timed for Arteta given that they come just as the headaches in the frontline appeared to be easing. The league leaders reached the international break without six attacking options and their manager was customarily circumspect when asked which of Gabriel Martinelli, Gabriel Jesus, Kai Havertz, Martin Odegaard, Viktor Gyokeres and Noni Madueke might be available for the visit of Tottenham. \"I can [tell you] but I'm not going to do it,\" he joked.His circumspection would suggest that at least some of those will be available. Martinelli is understood to have trained during the break and there has been speculation that both Odegaard and Madueke could be involved in some capacity. Arteta indicated he was as optimistic about the sextet as he had been in a relatively buoyant press conference before the international break and the 1-1 draw with Sunderland. However his insistence on keeping cards close to his chest will at least keep Thomas Frank guessing until an hour and a quarter before kickoff on Sunday.\n\"It's the final stage,\" he said, \"and now is when there is contact around them, when they have to be pushed into very unpredictable things that they haven't done. I think they are going to be with us soon, I don't know if Sunday is going to be too soon.\"\n        \n            \n                Ballon d'Or Power Rankings: Defenders don't usually win it, but Arsenal's Gabriel is making his case\n                \n                    James Benge                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHowever many forwards return it would be fair to wonder if Arteta would trade them all for Gabriel's fitness. The Brazilian is the rock on which the best defense in Europe is built, Arsenal having conceded five goals in 17 games across all competitions, and that is to say nothing of the devastation he routinely causes from set pieces. It would not be an exaggeration to suggest that Gabriel might have a serious chance of winning some of the sport's biggest individual prizes if he were to be fit throughout the season, a prospect that is looking increasingly slim. No matter how long he is out, Gabriel will be missed. \"Every player brings their specific qualities and Gabriel is his leadership, his presence and the love that he has to defend and to transmit as well his body language to other players. We have to do it, and we have to spread that.\"\nIt is something Arteta believes his squad can do. \"People will step up, we've done it in the past many, many times. Unfortunately, we played last year the biggest and most problematic part of the season without him as well, and the team was able to cope with that.\"In that Arteta is referring to the run to the end of last season in which Arsenal had to do without Gabriel -- and a host of other key players. The hamstring injury that seemed to be a hammer blow to their Champions League prospects, coming as it did on the eve of their quarterfinal against Real Madrid, did not necessarily destroy the Gunners, who lost only three of their final 12 matches.Then again as they staggered to the finish line they conceded 13 goals and allow a little over an expected goal per game. Before Gabriel went down it was 39 against in 46, 0.88 xG against per match. Jakub Kiwior stepped in impressively, raising his standing among supporters, but he was no Gabriel. Piero Hincapie might be one of the best back up center backs in the league but Gabriel is one of the best center backs in the world. Calafiori too, another option to fill in next to William Saliba, is a great talent. He just isn't Gabriel. No one is.\nViewing informationDate: Sunday, Nov. 23 | Time: 11:30 a.m. ETLocation: Emirates Stadium -- LondonLive stream: PeacockPredicted lineupsArsenal XI: David Raya; Jurrien Timber, William Saliba, Piero Hincapie, Riccardo Calafiori; Martin Zubimendi, Declan Rice; Bukayo Saka, Eberechi Eze, Leandro Trossard; Mikel MerinoTottenham XI: Guglielmo Vicario; Pedro Porro, Cristian Romero, Micky van de Ven, Destiny Udogie; Rodrigo Bentancur, Joao Palhinha, Pape Matar Sarr; Mohamed Kudus, Richarlison, Wilson Odobert\n            ",

Though that is around $300,000 less than he was making at Penn State, it does keep him among the top 20 highest-paid coaches in college football.Franklin's compensation is also staggered. He's set to make $500,000 in base annual salary with the rest of the money coming from incentives. Franklin will make more money each year of the deal, with the contract's value set to peak at $12.75 million in 2030. Notably, Virginia Tech is also increasing Franklin's salary pool to $15.5 million, which means that he'll have plenty of money to assemble his inaugural coaching staff with the Hokies. Here's a look at the other incentives baked into Franklin's first contract: \nHe can make up to $250,000 in bonuses for 12-win seasons. He'll be awarded $150,000 for any coach of the year awards. Franklin will receive bonuses for ACC Championship Game and College Football Playoff appearances with an $800,000 for winning a national title. Penn State and Franklin also agreed to a reduced buyout in light of his hiring at Virginia Tech. Instead of paying Franklin $49 million over the course of six years, Penn State is on the hook for just $9 million of Franklin's previous agreement with the school. Penn State fired Franklin in October amid a 3-3 start to the 2025 season. He departed the Nittany Lions with a 104-45 overall record, three top-10 finishes in the AP Top 25 poll, one Big Ten title (2016) and an appearance in the 2024 College Football Playoff. \nFranklin is set to replace Brent Pry, his former defensive coordinator at Penn State. Pry never won more than seven games with the Hokies, who were 0-3 at the time of his departure in September.  \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Lane Kiffin Watch continues. After meeting with Kiffin on Friday, Ole Miss athletic director Keith Carter said the focus is on next Friday's Egg Bowl vs. rival Mississippi State and that \"an announcement on Coach Kiffin's future is expected the Saturday following the game.\"That statement comes in the aftermath of what has been a wild week in Oxford, Mississippi. After a plane carrying multiple Kiffin family members, including ex-wife Layla Kiffin, traveled to Baton Rouge on Monday, the discussion of whether Kiffin will stay or go cranked into overdrive. There was also a less-publicized Kiffin family trip to Gainesville, Florida, the day before as the Gators continue to make their play for Kiffin's services, sources confirmed to CBS Sports. While it is unlikely there will be definitive clarity before next Saturday, numerous sources with knowledge of the situation have told CBS Sports in the last 24 hours that they believe the momentum has shifted in LSU's favor to land the talented head coach. To be clear, that does not mean it's a done deal. Throughout the week, Kiffin has seemingly gone back and forth by the day while trying to make a decision. For example, there were multiple days this week that sources felt like it was trending toward Kiffin taking the job at LSU only for it to then come across the next day like he was giving real thought to staying at Ole Miss. \"It's like following a high school recruiting process,\" one source said.Sources have indicated throughout the week that they believe Florida is running third in the Kiffin sweepstakes. \n\n        \n            \n                Ole Miss wants clarity from Lane Kiffin. He's not in a position to give it. What's next?\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAccording to those who know him well, Kiffin can struggle when making big decisions, which is why so many are hesitant to say definitively what he will do until he signs the contract. As many have pointed out in recent days, it felt like a foregone conclusion at one point that Kiffin was going to take the Auburn job back in 2022 before he ultimately decided to stay in Oxford. No. 6 Ole Miss (10-1) closes its regular season with the Egg Bowl against Mississippi State with a win potentially giving the Rebels a first-round home game in the College Football Playoff. CBS Sports reported earlier this week that sources said if Ole Miss was convinced Kiffin was not staying long-term in Oxford, it would not let him coach in the playoff. Ole Miss hoped to get clarity this week on Kiffin's decision, prompting Friday's meeting between Carter, Kiffin and Ole Miss chancellor Glenn Boyce. \"Coach Kiffin and I have had many pointed and positive conversations regarding his future at Ole Miss, including meeting today with Chancellor Boyce,\" Carter said. \"While we discuss next steps, we know we cannot lose sight of what is most important -- our sixth-ranked team that is poised to finish the regular season in historic fashion.\"\nCarter's statement made clear Kiffin will be coaching the Egg Bowl -- but now attention turns to whether that will be his last as Ole Miss' coach. \n            ",

She's been, I think, improving so quick, pushing to be able to play,\" Gonzalez said. \"Fortunately, we could see her last week, playing some minutes, and she's doing great, so obviously she's going to be available and ready to compete.\"Rodman's season has been marred by injuries. A lingering back injury sidelined her for nearly four months and even sent her to Europe for treatment. Just 16 games after she returned, an MCL sprain kept her sidelined during the playoff push. She was bench-listed for both playoff games, making only a brief cameo in the final minute of Washington's semifinal win over Portland -- her first action in a month. Now, with the Spirit on the brink of a second NWSL Championship title in four years, her game-day availability could be the difference between glory and heartbreak.\nYou can catch the game Saturday at 8 p.m. ET on CBS and Paramount+.Rodman has dominated championship-week headlines -- not just because of her return from injury, but for what comes next. The 23-year-old enters the final game of the season as a potential free agent this offseason, with a report looming regarding a lucrative offer from USL Super League side D.C. Power, according to The Athletic. Her future has become a talking point across the league, has prompted commissioner Jessica Berman to emphasize that she and the league \"want Trinity in the NWSL and we will fight for her.\" That backdrop adds even more intrigue to her availability for Saturday's must-watch title clash.Rodman's return to the pitch this season has been anything but smooth, but the fact that Gonzalez declared her \"available and ready to compete\" is a significant upgrade, considering she was labeled as questionable entering the semifinal against Portland, where she subbed in as a late-game option and played a minute. \nWhile that's not a ringing endorsement of the ability to play lengthy minutes, it took Rodman one minute and four touches to record a definitive shot on goal. It shows again why she's such an important player, no matter the amount of time she can give to the Spirit in a high-stakes game like the NWSL Championship. Her availability isn't just a boost; it could be a potential game-changer.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The last game of the year for the NWSL brings plenty of pomp and circumstance. There are celebrations and events to mark the NWSL Championship and the final two teams and players participating. There's also the news and headlines around offseason moves and what comes next. There has been plenty of reporting on the Washington Spirit and the contract status of Trinity Rodman ahead of the 2025 NWSL Championship. But for Gotham FC, they also have a key player navigating free agency leading into the big game. Forward Midge Purce has been with the club since 2020, back when they were Sky Blue FC. She's been with the team through sparse resources, a club rebrand, and an epic rise as bona fide contenders. When the club reached the NWSL Championship in 2023, her two-assist performance in the final earned her Championship MVP honors. Her impressive form earned her call-ups back into the national team, and then a huge setback, an ACL injury in March 2024, her previous contract year, and right as the U.S. women's national team was preparing for the Paris Olympics and Gotham FC began their title defense. Her journey back to the 2025 NWSL Championship is a story of triumphant highs and crushing setbacks. But there's also a resilient, quieter comeback that's set her up for another opportunity as an x-factor in Gotham's biggest game of the year. It's also one that could be her last in a Gotham FC jersey, as she's a free agent this offseason.\n\"I think you know you experience probably some of the worst case scenarios,\" Purce said on navigating the highs and lows of free agency. \"And I actually had the worst case scenario, which is, you tear your ACL going into that contract year. That wasn't amazing, but after that, coming back, you know, it's kind of no fear. So I just want to make sure I make the right decision for myself. Just putting me first.\"Where those decisions take her is yet to be determined. Sources familiar with Purce's previous negotiations confirmed to CBS Sports that other NWSL clubs were open to conversations about the forward with her skillset and versatility, but that other leagues were also interested, including Liga MX Femenil. \nPurce's road to recovery now culminates in another big stage moment. It's a testament to her determination and how the road back isn't a solo trip, and she makes sure to mention Rose Lavelle and Tierna Davidson as teammates she's relied on for advice and encouragement on injuries and injury setbacks in her own return to play. She's featured in 22 games this season, but didn't finally string together a full 90 minute game until the second half of the season.Her ability to create space, drive possession, and generate chances, are all major factors that don't always show up on the scoresheet. For now, she's just focused on the championship in front of her and not so much on whether or not this will be the last game she plays for Gotham FC. \"I don't really think about it that way, and maybe I should,\" she joked. \"You know, I've done this to myself before, where I don't sign a contract, and I'm playing a lot and I'm playing in big games. I just like to bet on myself, and if it doesn't work out, it doesn't work out. So I'm excited for the game. I'm pumped about it, and we'll see what follows after.\"\nPurce is a feeler on the pitch, and her instinct to find the game in moments where there's little tempo or lack of flow, is when she can be most effective. She's a difference maker in the final third, especially in high-stakes scenarios. If it is her final game in a Gotham kit, she wants it to be as memorable as possible. \"If it is my last game in a Gotham jersey, I just, I haven't even thought about that,\" she paused. \"I have to say the fandom is absolutely incredible. I love everyone who has been so committed and has created this amazing community and has watched. It's been an honor to watch it grow from Sky Blue to what it is now, and the caliber of players it's attracted and the statement it has made on not just a national scale, but a global scale. And I just want to say thank you to all my teammates who have made this time, just, you know, through the hard times and through the good times. No one else really sees everything the way my teammates do, so sending them so much love. Not just now, but for the rest of their careers and the rest of their lives. Just, thank you.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\nTwo star-studded teams in the Washington Spirit and Gotham FC will meet in San Jose for the NWSL Championship, a competitive match likely in store as each side chases their second league title.The pair took contrasting roads to the Championship, the No. 2 seed Spirit advancing as the favorites in their matchups while Gotham played spoiler as the No. 8 seed, eliminating the runaway NWSL Shield winners in the Kansas City Current and last year's champions Orlando Pride. To describe this as a David vs. Goliath-type game would be a misnomer, though, Gotham have been inconsistent, but they won the Championship just two years ago and boast an MVP nominee in Esther Gonzalez.While Gonzalez and new Gotham recruit Jaedyn Shaw headline Juan Carlos Amoros' team, the attention will also be squarely on the Spirit's Trinity Rodman. She returned from an MCL sprain in a very brief cameo in the Spirit's 2-0 win over the Portland Thorns last week, her exact status unclear. If there is any game she could play, though, it just might be one where there's a trophy on the line – in what could be her final NWSL game, her contract expiring upon the conclusion of the season.How to watch the NWSL Championship, oddsDate: Saturday, Nov. 2 | Time: 7=8 p.m. ETLocation: PayPal Park -- San Jose, Calif.Odds: Washington Spirit +130; Draw +210; Gotham FC +190Projected lineupsWashington Spirit: Aubrey Kingsbury, Rosemonde Kouassi, Esme Morgan, Rebeca Bernal, Tara McKeown, Kate Weisner, Hal Hershfelt, Leicy Santos, Croix Bethune, Trinity Rodman, Gift MondayRodman's availability will be the big talking point on Saturday, in large part because the Spirit are a different team when she is on the field. They have won nine of the 16 games she has played this season and posted a +15 goal differential along the way, while the number of wins dwindles to four in 11 games she did not play with a goal differential of -3. If Rodman cannot start, though, Italy international Sofia Cantore could fill in after starting against the Thorns while the Spirit's attacking plans will run through Gift Monday regardless, the Nigerian scoring 10 goals so far this season.Gotham FC: Ann-Katrin Berger, Bruninha, Emily Sonnett, Jess Carter, Lily Reale, Jaelin Howell, Jaedyn Shaw, Rose Lavelle, Gabi Portillo, Midge Purce, Esther GonzalezGotham's defensive stability has kept them afloat in a year of inconsistent attacking output, though not from a lack of effort on Gonzalez's part. The Spain international has 13 goals this season, just two behind MVp winner Temwa Chawinga, and Shaw's scintillating form has helped Gotham make up some of the attacking deficit left behind after Yazmeen Ryan and Lynn Biyendolo's departures in the offseason. Rose Lavelle is also in strong form, connecting expertly with international teammate Shaw to revive Gotham's offense at just the right time.PredictionThere is motivation and narrative to support either team's argument, setting up for a closely-contested Championship game – and perhaps a spicy one, if last year's semifinal in which the Spirit ousted Gotham on penalty kicks is anything to go by. This one will likely come down to a moment of brilliance from a star and there is no one who is more in-form than Shaw. She has two goals and an assist during Gotham's postseason run, a contribution on each and every goal they have scored in the playoffs so far. She has helped them pull off two upsets in a row, a third not exactly out of reach for a roster just as stacked as the one they will face. Pick: Washington Spirit 1, Gotham FC 2 (after extra time)\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Heading into Week 12, Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford is an inner-circle NFL MVP candidate. He's either the favorite or second favorite at basically every sportsbook in Vegas, and rightfully so. Stafford has completed 66% of his passes at an average of 7.6 yards per attempt, with a league-leading 27 touchdowns against just two interceptions. He has a career-high 112.7 passer rating and 68.7 QBR, and he checks in fifth in Tru Media's version of EPA per dropback and second in passing success rate. He recently became the first quarterback in history to throw for four-plus touchdowns and no interceptions in three consecutive games. He hasn't been picked off at all since Week 3, and he's thrown multiple touchdown passes in all but one game since then.His mind-meld connection with Puka Nacua (73 receptions for 850 yards in nine games) is alive and well, and every time he throws to Davante Adams (43 receptions for 569 yards and 10 touchdowns), it seemingly ends with Adams standing in the end zone, arms spread wide and celebrating a score.\nThis weekend against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Stafford has a chance to strengthen his case even further. \nFirst of all, it's a game against another NFC playoff team, just like the one the Rams won last week against the Seattle Seahawks. And that's going to keep a bunch of eyes on it -- especially because the game is happening on \"Sunday Night Football.\" More importantly, the Bucs have a pass-funnel defense that is far better against the run than it is against the pass, which typically pushes opponents into pass-happy game plans. The Bucs are second in opponents' rushing success rate, via Tru Media, and only 20th in passing success rate. \nThey're fresh off allowing Josh Allen to throw for 317 yards and three touchdowns last week, and Drake Maye to go for 270 yards and two scores the week before. They forced a trio of interceptions in those two games, but Stafford just hasn't really put the ball in danger all year. He's second in turnover-worthy throw rate (interceptions plus dropped interceptions, divided by pass attempts) per Tru Media, with just four such throws all season.  The Bucs are likely to be overmatched in the secondary, especially with cornerback Jamel Dean unable to suit up due to injury, and Stafford gets rid of the ball too quickly (his average time to throw is 2.66 seconds, fifth-fastest among 34 qualified quarterbacks) for the pass rush to get home and affect his rhythm. Tampa will also be without Haason Reddick, who has been out since Week 7.\n        \n            \n                Rams vs. Buccaneers: Where to watch Sunday's matchup, plus pick, odds, injuries and what you need to know\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nNacua and Adams should have advantageous matchups on the perimeter and in the slot, even if guys like Jacob Parrish and Benjamin Morrison have acquitted themselves fairly well for rookies so far this year. Antoine Winfield Jr. and Tykee Smith will be able to provide help, of course, but nobody has really proven they can stop the Nacua-Adams duo so far this year. It's probably not going to be this Bucs unit that has routinely allowed inferior pass offenses to put up big games.\nThe Rams will also get into heavy personnel and force the Bucs to decide whether to match with base defense and provide good matchups in the passing game, or stay in nickel personnel and allow Los Angeles to run the ball into lighter boxes with extra blockers. If they match with base defense, the tight ends could get going; if they don't, Kyren Williams and Blake Corum could start getting downhill and set up the play-action pass, which the Rams run more than almost anybody in the league. By the time the weekend is over, Stafford could be the odds-on favorite everywhere to take home the MVP trophy. The matchup is in his favor, and the way he's playing, he'd likely be able to put up that type of game even if it wasn't.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce is in the final year of his contract, and many speculate the 2025 season will be his last. Now 36-years-old, Kelce understands he will have a decision to make in the near future, but he won't keep his franchise guessing whether he plans to retire, or continue playing in 2026. \"I want to give the Chiefs a good opportunity, whether I come back or not -- or whether they want me back or not,\" Kelce said, via ESPN. \"I'd like to make that decision before they've got to get draft picks and free agency opens to fill the roster appropriately.\"All that will be at the end of the season. I won't be thinking about it until then.\"While he's in the midst of his 13th NFL season, Kelce is still productive. Through 10 games played, he leads the Chiefs with 50 catches for 631 yards and four touchdowns. Regarded as one of the best tight ends in NFL history, Kelce currently ranks third on the all-time receiving list at his position with 12,782 yards, trailing only Jason Witten (13,046 yards) and Chiefs legend Tony Gonzalez (15,127). However, Kelce is Kansas City's all-time leader in receptions (1,054), receiving yards and touchdowns (81). \nA three-time Super Bowl champion, Kelce has established himself as the best postseason tight end in NFL history. He is the NFL's all-time postseason leader in receptions (178), and just the third player to lead three Super Bowl champions in receiving yards, joining Hall of Fame wide receivers Jerry Rice and Michael Irvin. Kelce and Patrick Mahomes have connected for 18 touchdowns in the playoffs, which are the most scores by a duo in NFL postseason history -- three more than Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski.Prior to Super Bowl LIX eight months ago, it was reported that Kelce's decision to retire or play in 2025 could hinge on the outcome of their showdown with the Philadelphia Eagles, despite him telling reporters on Super Bowl Opening Night that he hoped to be playing football for years to come. The Chiefs were blown out by Jalen Hurts and Co. 40-22. Less than a month after the Super Bowl LIX loss, Kelce confirmed he was returning for his 13th season. He even said on his \"New Heights\" podcast that it was the Super Bowl loss that motivated him to keep playing.\n\"It was probably the biggest factor,\" Kelce said of his decision to return, via NFL.com. \"I mean, it's a pretty cool way to go out, but I just think I would still have this love for the game. ... I think I would have thought about it more if we would've won.\"While the Chiefs sit at 5-5 entering Week 12, they still have Super Bowl aspirations. Kelce is focused on winning football games right now, instead of his future or a farewell tour. \"I think the biggest thing is that I f-----g love playing the game of football,\" Kelce said this offseason. \"I love playing. I still feel like I can play it at a high level and possibly at a higher level than I did last year. I don't think it was my best outing. I think I let my guys down in a lot more moments than I helped them, especially if you look at my track record and how I've been in years past. I want to give it a good run. I got a bad taste in my mouth in how I ended last year and how well I was playing and how accountable I was to the people around me.\n\"I love so many people in Kansas City, both in that facility, in the community, and it's home for me now. I don't want to leave that life yet. I put in a lot of hard work and I put in a lot of focus into being the best that I can for K.C. Last year it didn't end well for us. I just feel like there's a responsibility in me to play out the contract that I initially signed, to give Kansas City and the Chiefs organization everything that I've got, and that's what I'm going to do, man.\"\n            ",

Curry is averaging 27.9 points per game at 37 years old, remaining one of the most un-guardable players in the league despite his age. Curry's return has one of SportsLine's top experts backing the Warriors to win as a part of Friday best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook for online sports betting.The SportsLine's advanced computer model also has a Friday best bet on the NBA slate, backing the Cavaliers to cover as 14.5-point favorites against the Wizards, and another one of SportsLine's top experts has a play on No. 5 UConn vs. Texas in college basketball action. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

The Wizards have lost three straight games, all by at least 15 points, and they are 1-4 over their last five games, with all four losses coming by at least 15 points. Even though Cleveland hasn't been as dominant as it was last year, the Cavaliers are still 14-11, and each of their last five wins has come by double-digit margins. The model views this as a significant mismatch, projecting the Cavaliers to cover even a spread this large in 68% of simulations. Back the Cavaliers at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Texas (+13.5) vs. UConn (-102)\"I think we have an obvious letdown spot for UConn coming off a tremendous win against the reigning national champion Florida Gators on Tuesday night in Madison Square Garden,\" SportsLine expert Chip Patterson said. \"Here they get a visit from Sean Miller's first Texas team, and while the Longhorns have not fared well against top competition, they are athletic enough to do some damage with a well-executed game plan. Speaking of game plan, Miller's Xavier team played UConn tough last year and peeled off a couple wins against the eventual national champs in 2023. This spread considers Texas way too much of a pushover, given the spot and the familiarity in the coaching matchup.\" Back the Texas at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Warriors (-125) to defeat the Timberwolves\"I'm gonna take a shot here,\" SportsLine expert Matt Severance said. \"Again, the NBA lines are so backward right now that I want to take any reasonable ones. Anthony Edwards is iffy for Minny. If he sits, then I believe this for sure cashes. It may anyways with Steph Curry back for the Dubs, although Draymond Green being out is not ideal.

    "body": "\n        The latest edition of the Army-Navy Game is set to unfold on Sunday at 3 p.m. ET, and bowl season also kicks off on Saturday when the Boise State Broncos take on the Washington Huskies in the LA Bowl at 8 p.m. ET. Navy has dominated its rivalry against Army over the years, winning 14 of the last 20 meetings. However, Army has been victorious in two of the past three meetings, and SportsLine's model is backing the Black Knights to cover the spread in 55% of simulations. According to the latest college football odds, the Black Knights are 6.5-point underdogs, while the over/under for Army vs. Navy is 38.5. The model is also backing Boise State (+10) to cover the spread against Washington in the LA Bowl, while the Over (52.5) hits 53% of the time in Boise State vs. Washington. Before locking in your college football picks for Saturday, Dec. 13, be sure to check out the top college football betting picks from SportsLine's advanced computer model. New users can also target the all-new DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times, and it is profitable on its top-rated money-line and over/under picks since the beginning of the 2024 season.

Bet it now at Caesars Sportsbook: \nArmy +6.5 vs. NavyArmy has won two of its last three meetings with Navy, and the Black Knights are 5-2 in their last seven games overall. Meanwhile, Navy enters this matchup having covered the spread just twice in its last eight contests. Army quarterback Cale Hellums has racked up 264 carries for 1,078 yards and 15 rushing scores this season, and SportsLine's model is expecting he'll keep Army competitive in this rivalry game. The Black Knights are projected to cover the spread in 55% of simulations on Saturday.Boise State +10 vs. WashingtonThe Broncos will enter Saturday's bowl game full of confidence after winning the Mountain West Conference title game over UNLV in convincing fashion last Saturday. Boise State hung 38 points on UNLV behind a strong showing from quarterback Maddux Madsen, who threw for 289 yards and three touchdowns. In addition, the Broncos are 8-3-1 ATS in their last 12 games. According to the model's projections, Washington secures the victory, but the Broncos cover the spread 53% of the time. Over 52.5 points in Washington vs. Boise StateBoth Boise State and Washington feature explosive offenses. The Broncos have scored 38 or more points in two of their last three games, while Washington enters the LA Bowl averaging 33.8 points per game, which ranks 22nd in college football. SportsLine's model is projecting these teams will combine for 55 points on Saturday, helping the Over hit in 53% of simulations.Want more college football picks?You've seen the model's college football best bets for Saturday, Dec. 13.

    "body": "\n        We continue to work our way through a limited schedule this week because of the NBA Cup. While all eyes might be on the semifinals on Saturday, fantasy managers are scouring the waiver wire for players who can help their teams. Here are five players to consider adding who are still available in the majority of CBS leagues.Kyle Filipowski, Utah Jazz (50% rostered)Filipowski is averaging a modest 23 minutes per game for the season. Still, he has been fantasy relevant with averages of 9.6 points, 6.4 rebounds, 2.5 assists, and one 3-pointer. He has seen more playing time lately, logging at least 29 minutes across his last five games, two of which were starts. During that span, he provided 14 points, 8.2 rebounds, 3.4 assists, 1.4 steals, and 1.2 3-pointers a night.The Jazz are well on their way to another season of missing out on the playoffs. As they continue to rack up losses, it would not be a surprise if veteran Jusuf Nurkic is traded or takes a back seat to Filipowski. There is also the potential for a Lauri Markkanen trade. Over 28 games after the All-Star break last season, Filipowski averaged 14.3 points, 8.1 rebounds, 2.3 assists, and 1.7 3-pointers. As his role looks to be expanding, adding him now could pay off in the long run.Herbert Jones, New Orleans Pelicans (38% rostered)Jones recently missed eight straight games with a calf strain. He started and played 26 minutes in his return Monday, then logged 14 minutes in a start against the Trail Blazers on Thursday before being ejected. Even with the emergence of Derik Queen and Saddiq Bey, Jones should play around 30 minutes on a nightly basis, especially with Zion Williamson (adductor) currently out.\nEven with ample playing time, Jones isn't likely to provide a ton of scoring. The reason to roster him in fantasy is because of his ability to rack up steals. He has averaged 1.5 steals per game this season and has never finished a season averaging fewer than 1.4 steals. For those hunting for help in the category, there may be no better player to add off the waiver wire than Jones.Maxime Raynaud, Sacramento Kings (37% rostered)The Kings continue to play without Domantas Sabonis, who is working his way through a partially torn meniscus. They initially turned to Drew Eubanks to replace Sabonis in the starting lineup, but that experiment didn't last long. A much more productive option has been Raynaud, who has played at least 22 minutes in each of the last six games.With Raynaud receiving additional opportunities, he has averaged 15.5 points, 7.2 rebounds, 1.8 assists, and 0.8 blocks over that six-game span. The rookie is not only shooting 52.7% from the field this season, but he has also made 75.9% of his attempts from the charity stripe. The Kings tend to make some weird lineup decisions, but with how well he is playing and their lack of options with Sabonis out, it would be a surprise if Raynaud doesn't remain in his new role.\nDaniel Gafford, Dallas Mavericks (31% rostered)Gafford is currently battling an ankle injury. After injuries limited him to 57 games last season, Gafford has appeared in just 15 games this season. When he has played, he has been underwhelming with averages of 8.9 points and 6.4 rebounds, although he has averaged 1.4 blocks and shot 61% from the field.None of the above seems to be making a case for adding Gafford. However, the Mavericks delivered the news Wednesday that Dereck Lively II (foot) is set to undergo season-ending surgery. Anthony Davis has expressed multiple times that he prefers not to play center, so the Lively injury could provide a boost for Gafford for the remainder of the season. Once Gafford gets through his current ankle issue, he has a path to play around 20-25 minutes a game.Marcus Smart, Los Angeles Lakers (9% rostered)Smart recently missed six games with a back injury. He returned in grand fashion Wednesday, scoring 26 points over 28 minutes off the bench against the Spurs. Smart took a whopping 14 three-point attempts, making eight of them. While bouncing in and out of the starting lineup, the veteran has averaged 27 minutes in his first season with the Lakers.\nSmart's overall averages of 10.4 points, 2.3 rebounds, and 2.8 assists through 15 games are nothing to write home about. However, that doesn't mean he's not a viable fantasy option in deeper formats. He is also averaging 1.6 three-pointers and 1.7 steals. Prior to last season's disastrous stints with the Grizzlies and Wizards, Smart had averaged at least 1.6 3-pointers and 1.5 steals in five straight seasons. The Lakers don't have a ton of quality depth, so there should be enough minutes available for Smart to help fantasy managers in both departments again.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Angel Reese is taking part in training camp with USA Basketball this weekend, and during her media session on Friday she stated that she will remain with the Chicago Sky despite a tumultuous end to the 2025 WNBA season. \"I'm under contract, so yes, I plan on returning to the Sky,\" Reese told reporters during her first interview since September. \"I'm continuing to talk to Tyler and building that relationship with Jeff and Tyler,\" she added, referring to Sky head coach Tyler Marsh and general manager Jeff Pagliocca. Reese is under contract through 2027, when the Sky have a team option, but there has been plenty of speculation about her future. The two-time All-Star did not play in the team's final four games due to a combination of injury and suspensions (both team and league issued), and gave a controversial interview to the Chicago Tribune, in which she aired her frustrations with the front office, coaching staff and roster construction, and called for major moves in free agency. \n\"I'm not settling for the same shit we did this year,\" Reese said. \"We have to get good players. We have to get great players. That's a non-negotiable for me.\"I'm willing and wanting to play with the best. And however I can help to get the best here, that's what I'm going to do this offseason. So it's going to be very, very important this offseason to make sure we attract the best of the best because we can't settle for what we have this year.\"Reese also made comments about specific players, and at one point expressed concern about Courtney Vandersloot's age. \n\"We can't rely on Courtney to come back at the age that she's at,\" Reese said. \"I know she'll be a great asset for us, but we can't rely on that. We need someone probably a little younger with some experience, somebody who's been playing the game and is willing to compete for a championship and has done it before.\"\n        \n            \n                Sky fall: How Angel Reese has been pushed to her limit in two seasons and what's next in Chicago\n                \n                    Lindsay Gibbs                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nVandersloot responded publicly, saying her \"age is absolutely not a factor\" and stated her plan to return to the Sky in 2026. Reese later apologized, both privately and publicly, to her teammates and said her comments were \"taken out of context.\" The organization eventually suspended Reese for the first half of the team's game against the Las Vegas Aces on Sept. 7; she had already been suspended by the league for the game on Sept. 5 against the Indiana Fever for accumulating too many technical fouls. \nReese sat out of the second half on Sept. 7 due to a back injury and missed the team's final two games of the season due to the issue. She later opted out of her exit interview, as did Vandersloot and Ariel Atkins. \"I am very vocal about what we need and what I want,\" Reese said in her interview with the Tribune. \"I'd like to be here for my career, but if things don't pan out, obviously I might have to move in a different direction and do what's best for me.\"While that comment inititally seemed like a nod at leaving in free agency one day, the events that transpired after the interview led many to wonder if she would request a trade this offseason. Reese made it clear Friday that she will not force her way out of town. \n\n        \n            \n                Chicago Sky offseason outlook: What's next for Angel Reese and Co. after a disastrous 2025 campaign\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThat's great news for the Sky, who are trying to forge a path forward after a disastrous 2025 season. Despite making a number of win-now moves -- most notably, trading the No. 3 pick (Sonia Citron) and a 2027 first-round swap to the Washington Mystics for Atkins -- the Sky went 10-34, tied the single-season losses record and missed the playoffs for the second season in a row. The Sky have the No. 5 pick in the 2026 WNBA Draft and, like every team, will have plenty of cap and roster space to make moves this offseason once a new collective bargaining agreement is in place. \n            ",

One month later, he signed a massive $330 million contract, which includes $250 million guaranteed.\nAllen will try to keep building on his memorable year this weekend as the Bills go on the road to face the New England Patriots in what could be a playoff preview. Buffalo will try to keep its hopes of winning the AFC East intact as New England seals a division title with a victory.Either way, the Bills are likely head to the playoffs once again, and Allen will be tasked with delivering a Super Bowl for the first time in franchise history. With the Kansas City Chiefs, Baltimore Ravens and Cincinnati Bengals all out of the postseason at the moment, the AFC is as wide open as it's been in a long time.\nIt may be hard to top the year he's having right now, but if Allen can get his first Super Bowl, that would be a decent start to 2026.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Utah coach Kyle Whittingham is stepping down from his post, the school announced on Friday. Whittingham, 66, has been Utah's coach since 2005 and has been with the program as a position coach since 1994.\"The time is right to step down from my position as the head coach at the University of Utah,\" Whittingham said in a statement. \"It's been an honor and a privilege to lead the program for the past 21 years, and I'm very grateful for the relationships forged with all the players and assistant coaches that have worked so hard and proudly worn the drum and feather during our time here.\"The opportunity to guide so many talented young men as they pursued their goals -- both on and off the field -- has truly been a blessing. Thank you to the university, the Salt Lake community, all of Ute Nation and most of all my wife and family for your unwavering support that has helped make Utah Football what it is today.\"Whittingham, who began his tenure at Utah 32 years ago as defensive line coach under Ron McBride, took over for Urban Meyer in 2005 after the Utes completed a 12-0 season and won the 2005 Fiesta Bowl in dominant fashion over Pittsburgh. He went 177-88 overall across 21 seasons, overseeing Utah's transition from the Mountain West into the Power Five when it joined the Pac-12 in 2011 and again transitioned into the Big 12 in 2024.\nThough there were disappointing seasons, Whittingham led the Utes to eight double-digit win campaigns, including four of the last seven seasons. The Athletic reported that Whittingham is not retiring from coaching and could seek other coaching opportunities. The Utes are set to face Nebraska on Dec. 31 in the Las Vegas Bowl, which will be the final game of Whittingham's coaching career with the program. Under Whittingham, Utah finished with a winning record in 18 of his 21 seasons as the coach.Scalley set to take over for Whittingham CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz reported that Whittingham has informed some internally at Utah that the program is set to name defensive coordinator Morgan Scalley as the school's new coach. Scalley, 46, has been with the Utah program since 2007, when he started his coaching career as a graduate assistant.\nScalley has been the defensive coordinator/safeties coach at his alma mater since 2016. Last summer, Utah officially named Scalley as the head coach in waiting. Scalley was a finalist for the 2019 Broyles Award, given annually to the top assistant coach in college football, after Utah boasted the nation's top run defense.\n            ",

    "body": "\nCade Cunningham is undoubtedly the cheese that tops the Detroit Pistons' pizza, but have you seen what Jalen Duren has done this season? The 22-year-old specimen has had a breakout season, averaging a career-high in scoring (18.8 points per game) while emerging as a potential NBA All-Star. He's a large (6-foot-10, 250 pounds to be exact) reason why the Pistons (19-5) own the best record in the Eastern Conference and second-best record in the entire league.If you haven't seen Duren yet this season, you'll get a chance on Friday when he and Detroit take on the Atlanta Hawks at Little Caesars Arena in Detroit.Duren's success shouldn't be a surprise; he has displayed freaky athleticism for years. Behind Duren and Cunningham, the Pistons rank fourth in the NBA in defensive rating (111.3). On Friday, they will square off against a Hawks team they've already beaten twice in two meetings this season. Atlanta has lost three of its last four games but is coming off a 15-point win at the Wizards.Detroit is a 7.5-point favorite against the Hawks.While Pistons vs. Hawks is the marquee attraction on Friday, there are other options on a sporting landscape that includes seven NBA matchups and 13 college basketball games. Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Friday, Dec. 12. All times Eastern.NBA best bets, where to watchHawks at PistonsTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Detroit | TV: NBA TV | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Hawks +234\nWhile Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Nikola Jokic are the leading candidates for the NBA MVP award, Cunningham certainly is making a case to be considered. He ranks second in the league in assists per game (9.3) and 11th in points per game (27.5) while also averaging 6.4 rebounds a game for the top team in the East. In the two previous matchups against the Hawks this season, he has averaged 21.5 points, 9.0 assists and 7.0 rebounds. Meanwhile, Atlanta may have found something offensively over the last week. In two games against the Nuggets and Warriors, the Hawks had an offensive rating of 127.5, which ranks fourth in the league over that time. The SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every game 10,000 times, says Atlanta has a 40% chance to win and assigns a moderate B grade to Hawks money line (+234).Timberwolves at WarriorsTime: 10 p.m. | Location: San Francisco | TV: NBA TV | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Over 230.5 | Expert: Warriors -120 (Matt Severance)\nSplash Brother Steph Curry is on track to return on Friday after missing the last five games with a left quad contusion and muscle strain. Meanwhile, Timberwolves guard Anthony Edwards is listed as questionable because of right foot soreness, and if he can't go, that would obviously be a significant absence for Minnesota. Over his last 10 games, Edwards is averaging 31.4 points per game (while shooting 53.0% from the field), which ranks fourth in the league over that time, behind only Luka Doncic, Gilgeous-Alexander and Jokic. \"If he sits, then I believe this for sure cashes,\" Severance says. Meanwhile, the SportsLine Projection Model says there's a 55.2% chance the teams combine for 231 points or more and gives a B grade to Over 230.5.College basketball best bets, where to watchMissouri State at XavierTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Cincinnati | TV: truTV | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Missouri State +17.5 | Expert: Xavier -18.5 (Bruce Marshall)\nTre Carroll and the Xavier Musketeers are on a bit of a roll. The Musketeers (7-3) have won four in a row and five of their last six, with the one loss being a one-point defeat to Georgia. Meanwhile, over the last two games Carroll averaged 25.5 points, 6.5 rebounds and 2.5 assists in ‍wins over Cincinnati and Saint Francis. The performances earned him the Big East Player of the Week award. Meanwhile, Missouri State coach Cuonzo Martin and the Bears (4-4) have struggled recently, losing four of their last six games. Marshall notes that Missouri State has lost its two road games this season by an average of 21.0 points a game. \"Cuonzo's team also isn't helping itself with subpar 29.7% shooting beyond the arc,\" he says. However, the SportsLine Projection Model says the Bears have a 52% chance to cover and assigns a C grade to Missouri State +17.5.Texas at No. 5 ConnecticutTime: 8 p.m. | Location: Hartford | TV: FOX | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Over 145.5 | Expert: Texas +13.5 (Chip Patterson)\nThe fifth-ranked UConn Huskies (9-1) face a familiar foe on Friday when they take on Sean Miller and the Texas Longhorns (7-3). Over the last three seasons, the Huskies faced Miller seven times when he was the head coach at Xavier. The Huskies went 4-3 against Miller and the Musketeers. (Connecticut lost just 19 times in its other 107 games.) Patterson notes the Huskies could be set up for a letdown after pulling out a 77-73 victory over defending national champion Florida on Tuesday at Madison Square Garden. \"This spread considers Texas way too much of a pushover given the spot and the familiarity in the coaching matchup,\" Patterson says. Meanwhile, the SportsLine Projection Model says there's a 68.9% chance the teams combine for 146 points or more and gives a B grade to Over 145.5.Looking aheadCollege football: Army vs. NavyTime: 3 p.m. Saturday | Location: Baltimore | TV: CBS | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Over 38.5  | Expert: Over 38.5 (Mike Tierney)\nJoe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak. UCLA's seven straight men's basketball titles. And ... the Under hitting 16 straight times in the Army Navy game from 2006-21? Certainly to sports bettors, the Army-Navy Under run ranks as one of the greatest streaks in sports history. But the Over has hit in two of the last three years, including last year when the teams combined for 44 points. This year, Navy (9-2) owns the 31st-best scoring offense in the country (32.5 points per game) while Army (6-5) is 99th at 23.0. Tierney also notes that Army has picked up the pace on offense, ranking 67th in snaps per game. \"Unless the coaches go scared conservative on play-calling, this matchup should easily find the 40s in points,\" he says. The SportsLine Projection Model agrees. It says the teams combine for 39 points or more and assigns a B grade to Over 38.5.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Catcher took a big leap in 2025, with Hunter Goodman, Ben Rice, Agustin Ramirez and Drake Baldwin all emerging as impact bats at the position and Kyle Teel making his presence known as well. But that's not the end of it. Samuel Basallo barely got his feet wet at the end of the year. Same for Carter Jensen. They rank as the top two in a catcher class that remains loaded with offensive talent, even with the recent influx we've seen in the majors. 2026 Prospects: C | 1B | 2B | 3B | SS | OF | P  Some of it's still far away, and the assurances run out before we arrive at the 10th name on the list. But that should go without saying at catcher, a position where playing time can be unpredictable and not every prospect goes on to meet the high defensive threshold. I would guess at least three of these catchers don't actually end up as catchers. But the bottom line is that there's still plenty to look forward to at this position even with the embarrassment of riches in the majors. \nNote: These rankings are intended mainly for Dynasty use, emphasizing long-term value over a quick payoff, but to say proximity holds no weight wouldn't be entirely accurate either. Not all of these players will contribute in 2026 — most, in fact, will not — but among prospects, they're the names Fantasy Baseballers most need to know.  1. Samuel Basallo, Orioles  Age (on opening day): 21 Where he played in 2025: Triple-A, majors Minor league stats: .270 BA (270 AB), 23 HR, .966 OPS, 44 BB, 76 K Major league stats: .165 BA (109 AB), 4 HR, .559 OPS, 6 BB, 30 K Though a masher of the highest standing in the minors, Basallo failed to capitalize on a late-season injury to Adley Rutschman, continuing the Orioles' recent trend of high-profile prospect disappointments. The sample was too small to take at face value, though, and the expectation is that he'll enter spring training with the inside track at either first base or DH, making him an early Rookie of the Year favorite. \n 2. Carter Jensen, Royals Age (on opening day): 22 Where he played in 2025: Double-A, Triple-A, majors Minor league stats: .290 BA (427 AB), 20 HR, 10 SB, .878 OPS, 60 BB, 122 K Major league stats: .300 BA (60 AB), 3 HR, .941 OPS, 9 BB, 12 K Jensen had the major league debut Basallo was supposed to, forcing his way into an everyday role with a 95.4 mph average exit velocity and the top-line production to match. It was a clarifying performance for a player who caught some evaluators by surprise -- a seamless continuation of his minor league breakthrough -- and it might lead to Salvador Perez spending most of his time at DH this year.  3. Josue Briceno, Tigers Age (on opening day): 21 Where he played in 2025: High-A, Double-A Minor league stats: .266 BA (364 AB), 20 HR, .883 OPS, 66 BB, 87 K \nBriceno's MVP performance in the Arizona Fall League a year ago indeed carried over to regular season play at High-A, where he slashed .296/.422/.602 in 55 games. His production slipped with a midseason move up to Double-A, but he was still only 20 at the time and sustained his strong plate discipline and exit velocity readings. Rarely these days are catchers as tall as he is, but to use an old trope, the bat will play anywhere.4. Rainiel Rodriguez, Cardinals Age (on opening day): 19 Where he played in 2025: Rookie, Low-A, High-A Minor league stats: .276 BA (301 AB), 20 HR, .954 OPS, 54 BB, 65 K Given    what he's already accomplished at age 18 -- climbing all the way to    High-A with strike-zone judgment beyond his years, a swing that's    optimized for power, and exit velocities as high as 111 mph -- it's not    hard to imagine Rodriguez claiming the top spot on this list as early   as  next year. He may have trouble finding a defensive  home if he   doesn't stick as a catcher, which is a legitimate question  with Ivan Herrera, Leonardo Bernal and Jimmy Crooks also up and coming for the Cardinals. \n5. Alfredo Duno, Reds Age (on opening day): 20   Where he played in 2025: Low-A   Minor league stats: .287 BA (390 AB), 18 HR, .948 OPS, 95 BB, 91 K There's a case for ranking Duno ahead of Briceno given that he's already producing major league-caliber exit velocities as a 19-year-old and slashed .316/.456/.632 over his final 40 games, but Briceno was putting up similar numbers a step higher on the minor-league ladder. It's true that Duno is the more likely of the two to stick at catcher, but that's not always the best thing for a player's Fantasy value (because of playing time concerns and whatnot).6. Moises Ballesteros, Cubs Age (on opening day): 22 Where he played in 2025: Triple-A, majors   Minor league stats: .316 BA (446 AB), 13 HR, 29 2B, .858 OPS, 49 BB, 67 K Major league stats: .298 BA (57 AB), 2 HR, 2 2B, .868 OPS, 9 BB, 12 K \nThe first thing you'll notice about Ballesteros is that he's built like a bowling ball, but what matters more is his uncanny knack for making good contact on bad pitches, which points to high batting average potential. He's often compared to Alejandro Kirk because of his shape, position and contact skills, but I think a Pablo Sandoval comp more accurately captures his upside as a hitter, not to mention his likelihood of moving off catcher. Note: Ballesteros is eligible only at DH to begin 2026 since that's where he spent most of his time with the big club in 2025. Because I won't be ranking DH prospects, though, I thought it only fitting for me to rank him at his natural position, even if the odds are against him sticking there.  7. Harry Ford, NationalsAge (on opening day): 23   Where he played in 2025: Triple-A, majors   Minor league stats: .283 BA (374 AB), 16 HR, 7 SB, .868 OPS, 74 BB, 88 K \nFord reversed the trend of declining power with his move up to Triple-A, positioning himself as a top catcher prospect again, but the tradeoff is that he gave up on being a base-stealer, dropping from 35 in 2024 to seven in 2025. Still, the overall profile appears to be more viable, particularly when you factor in his career .405 on-base percentage in the minors, and now that his competition is Keibert Ruiz instead of Cal Raleigh, he has a real chance to break through in 2026. 8. Eduardo Tait, Twins Age (on opening day): 19 Where he played in 2025: Low-A, High-A Minor league stats: .253 BA (438 AB), 14 HR, 32 2B, .738 OPS, 36 BB, 99 K The stat line may not blow you away, but there's plenty of upside to project onto Tait, who shows considerable power potential with his exit velocities peaking near 114 mph as a teenager. He has yet to fully actualize that power and has strides to make with regard to pitch selection in defense, but the prize of the Jhoan Duran deal is well ahead of the developmental curve, having reached High-A prior to turning 19. \n 9. Ethan Salas, Padres Age (on opening day): 19 Where he played in 2025: Double-A Minor league stats: 6 for 32 (.188), 1 2B, 2 SB, 6 BB, 5 K It feels obligatory to rank Salas here given the mountains of praise heaped upon him as a 17-year-old, but the honest truth is that he hasn't hit a lick in the two years since. Granted, he didn't get a fair shot in 2025, missing most of the year with a stress reaction in his back, and he remains young for his level even if no longer outrageously so. Factor in his Gold Glove-caliber defense, and he's not yet a lost cause.  10. Cooper Ingle, GuardiansAge (on opening day): 24   Where he played in 2025: Double-A, Triple-A   Minor-league stats: .260 BA (510 AB), 10 HR, 36 2B, .808 OPS, 86 BB, 85 K \nThere isn't a clear choice for the No. 10 spot, so while I have some affection for Leonardo Bernal, Jeferson Quero and Marco Dinges, I'll opt for the catcher with the clearest path to playing time, which is Ingle. A Jonathan Lucroy type who consistently walks more than he strikes out and hits doubles like they're going out of style, Ingle may be ready to push Bo Naylor, who has yet to find his footing in the majors after several years of trying.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        FRISCO, Texas -- The murkiness surrounding Pro Bowl cornerback Trevon Diggs (knee) and the Dallas Cowboys amid his extended injured reserve stint is beginning to clear. He spoke to the media for the first time in weeks, and the 2021 NFL interceptions leader said he is ready to play and expects to play on \"Sunday Night Football\" against the Minnesota Vikings. Dallas officially lists Diggs as questionable to play on Sunday after being limited in practice all week. \"I'm ready though,\" Diggs said. \"I think our intensity level to make this playoff push and play for each other [led to a great week of practice]. ... \"I feel really healthy. I feel really healthy this time around, so I'm just going to go out there, give it 100% that I can and we'll see what happens.\"Dallas ruled Diggs out the Friday before Week 7 against the Washington Commanders after the cornerback suffered a concussion in an accident at his home. When Diggs was in concussion protocol, the Cowboys placed him on injured reserve because of his knee being reaggravated, and he hasn't played since, missing the last seven games. \nThe team opened Diggs' 21-day practice window to work his way back to a return from injured reserve on Nov. 30, and he has until Dec. 20 at 4 p.m., the day before the Cowboys' Week 16 home finale against the Chargers, to be activated. Otherwise, Diggs would remain on IR and not return to play this season. His situation began to take an intriguing turn with the team not activating him from IR last week or indicating throughout the direction of this week that Diggs would be ready to play. For the last two weeks, he has looked as spry as another Cowboys cornerback in the media viewing portion of practice. Diggs playfully chased a teammate across Dallas' locker room after a practice this week with plenty of speed. \"It's hard, it's definitely been hard,\" Diggs said when talking about his extended absence. \"People feel how how they feel. You just got to roll with the punches and keep pushing forward.\"Head coach Brian Schottenheimer's Friday comments on Diggs' situation were the most upbeat they've been across the last few weeks. \"Consistency\" and doing \"everything the right way\" have been Diggs' prescribed keys to return to action the last two weeks. \n\"Doing well, having a good week. We'll see how today goes, and again excited to see how he finishes the week,\" Cowboys coach Brian Schottenheimer said before practice on Friday. ... \"Well number one, I don't just talk about that [consistency] with Trevon. I talk about the word consistency in a lot of things. It's my favorite word that I use with you guys. Why? Because to sustain success and win in this league, you need to be consistent. So, it just means doing things right all the time, and that's everybody. It's not just about Trevon.\"The 27-year-old began fully trusting his knee as recently as last week, but given the emphasis on consistency from Schottenheimer, defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus and the rest of the coaching staff, he understood why he didn't get activated for Week 14 at the Detroit Lions. \"Last week. Yeah, last week I felt good to play. I didn't get a lot of practice though, so that could also be the issue,\" Diggs said. \"I feel like I got a lot of reps in this week and a lot of practice in. It's going to be a good week.\"\nQuarterback Dak Prescott served as the conduit between Diggs and the coaching staff at times, providing him both words of encouragement and direct feedback from the coaches about what they would like to see from him in order to return to the active roster.  \"I would say my role that's come in is more of just being optimistic, being the motivator in that sense. Knowing what he's been going through, knowing how much he wants to play and thinking that he may have been called up or got back last week and then didn't, for whatever the reason,\" Prescott said Thursday. \"Just being able to talk to him, being a sounding board and honestly giving him real, honest feedback. Not just what he wants to hear, but probably 'this is what the coaches are thinking, this is what you've presented, this is what you've given them and this is the best way that I can see it.' He's growing. He's growing each and every day in every aspect of it. Excited for him just to continue to get healthy and get back to the guy that he's confident in being and going and making those plays.\"  Diggs' change of direction and reintegration into a defense with a number of different players -- linebacker DeMarvion Overshown, third-round rookie cornerback Shavon Revel, All-Pro defensive tackle Quinnen Williams and linebacker Logan Wilson -- factored into his prolonged layoff.   \n\"I think the other thing to realize is the ramp up portion of this is real. You don't play football for four weeks, you don't forget how to play, but you also haven't moved and had to change direction,\" Schottenheimer said. \"The thing that's so crazy about our sport, you guys know this, it's not just you. It's the working alongside 10 other guys, and there's calls and communication. Things that have to be better. Once we feel like that's where we're at, then certainly we know what kind of player Trevon can be.\"\nWhen Diggs went down entering Week 7, the Cowboys were averaging 30.7 points per game, the second-most in the NFL at the time. Since Dallas acquired Williams and Wilson at the trade deadline and activated both Overshown and Revel off of IR in Week 11, the Cowboys are averaging 27.3 points per game, ranking 27th in the league in that span. Perhaps the biggest change that's come in that span is Dallas' run defense: they were allowing 142.2 rushing yards per game through the first six weeks of the season, and they are allowing just 79.5 rushing yards per game since Week 11, the second-lowest mark in the league. \"Yeah, really good. Everything's been looking like it's coming together really well, how it's supposed to,\" Diggs said of how the defense has looked of late. \"Momentum is going really well, flowing how it's supposed to. Momentum is going really well.\"\nReturning to the football field with his Cowboys teammates served as the main driver of motivation for Diggs to become healthy enough to play again in 2025. \"Just being able to go back out there with my brothers. Being able to play with those guys,\" Diggs said. \"Run around, fly around, hit people, take the ball away. Just doing everything together as a team. I feel that's the most fun part that I've missed. Just, I miss that truly.\"He acknowledged these last four games of the regular season are \"very important\" for the 6-6-1 Cowboys' dwindling playoff hopes, which currently sit at 11.9% according to CBS' SportsLine model. He \"of course\" wants to aid Dallas' playoff push. \nThe stretch run of the season could also heavily color his reputation not only in the Cowboys' organization but throughout the rest of the NFL, which could potentially matter if Dallas decides to part ways with him in the offseason. If the Cowboys opted for an offseason divorce, Dallas would save around $12.6 million in cap space if he is released before June 1 in 2026. A post-June 1 release would free up $15.5 million. Diggs' $19.4 million average per year salary on his five-year, $97 million contract is tied for the 10th-highest at the cornerback position, according to OverTheCap.com. Diggs has missed 28 games since 2023 because of knee injuries, including a torn ACL in practice in 2023. However, he isn't currently sweating the future. \"No, not really because I know who I am. I know what I'm capable of. I'm not having a crisis of not knowing. I know how to play football. I know what skillset I have, so it's just all about showing it, putting it out there and making the plays that I always make. If it's up to Diggs, he would like to remain a Cowboy for the foreseeable future. Weeks 15-18 will certainly be quite illuminating for a player whose 20 career interceptions since entering the league as a second-round pick in 2020 are tied for the second-most in the NFL.\n\"Yeah, of course. I love Dallas. But, you know, at the end of the day, it's a business. Whatever happens, happens. I'm prepared, I'm ready for it. I would love to be here. I love everything that comes with Dallas, the fans, the relationships I've built here. But if that's not what it is, that's just not what it is.\"  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        With one game already in the books, Week 15 of the NFL season is off to an interesting start. Because all of the bye weeks are now in the rearview mirror, there are another 15 games on tap for Sunday and Monday. Luckily for football fans, most of the key players for the 30 teams still yet to take the field will be in action for those contests. But there are some who will be out and others whose statuses remain up in the air. In the space below, you'll find detailed injury reports for all 14 contests that will take place on Sunday, as well as an initial update on the key Monday night game between the Dolphins and the Steelers.All Week 15 NFL betting lines via DraftKings Sportsbook.Cleveland Browns at Chicago Bears (-7.5)TEAMPLAYERPOSITIONINJURYSTATUSBrownsDavid NjokuTEKneeOutDylan SampsonRBCalf/HandOutAdin HuntingtonDTQuadOutWyatt TellerOGCalfOutDenzel WardCBCalfOutDeshaun WatsonQBAchillesOutJoel BitonioOGKnee/BackQuestionableZak ZinterOGBackQuestionableCedric TillmanWRConcussion/RibQuestionableBearsKyler GordonCBGroinOutTravis HomerRBAnkleOutRome OdunzeWRFootQuestionableNjoku was injured while catching a touchdown pass last week but has fallen behind Harold Fannin Jr. in snaps. Sampson's absence will mean a larger role for Jerome Ford. Teller's absence and Bitonio's potential absence could hurt the Browns up front against a poor Bears defense. Ward is a key piece in the secondary and will be missed. Tillman hasn't been as large a part of the offense recently as he was early in the season but is still a valuable part of the receiver rotation.\nGordon has played in only three games this year and missed last week against Green Bay. Odunze was limited in practice throughout the week after also missing last week's game against the Packers.Baltimore Ravens at Cincinnati Bengals (+2.5)TEAMPLAYERPOSITIONINJURYSTATUSRavensRashod BatemanWRAnkleQuestionableTavius RobinsonOLBFootQuestionableAr'Darius WashingtonSAchillesQuestionableBengalsTee HigginsWRConcussionOutPJ JulesSAnkleDoubtfulShemar StewartDLKneeDoubtfulBateman was a late-week addition and then downgraded to DNP on Friday, which is usually not a good sign. Washington practiced fully all week could be be gearing up to return from his extended stay on injured reserve.Higgins will miss his second game in the last three weeks due to a concussion. Trey Hendrickson was placed on IR and is out for the year, so missing Stewart as well would be a blow to Cincinnati up front.\nArizona Cardinals at Houston Texans (-9.5)TEAMPLAYERPOSITIONINJURYSTATUSCardinalsMarvin Harrison Jr.WRHeelOutJalen ThompsonSHamstringOutParis Johnson Jr.OLKneeOutMax MeltonCBHeelOutDadrion Taylor-DemersonSAnkleOutEvan BrownOLPersonalOutBilal NicholsDLKneeOutXavier WeaverWRHamstringOutWalter NolenDLKneeQuestionableChristian JonesOLKneeQuestionableElijah HigginsTEIllnessQuestionableEmari DemercadoRBAnkleQuestionableL.J.

The Cards are beset by injuries in the secondary and potentially along the defensive line. If Demercado misses again, they'll also remain shorthanded in the backfield after they did not activate Trey Benson from injured reserve earlier this week.If Chubb can't go, Woody Marks will again carry the load for the Texans. Bryant and Watson fully practiced on Friday while Speed was limited.New York Jets at Jacksonville Jaguars (-13.5)TEAMPLAYERPOSITIONINJURYSTATUSJetsJustin FieldsQBKneeOutFrancisco MauigoaLBNeckOutMason TaylorTENeckOutTyrod TaylorQBGroinOutAzareye'h ThomasCBShoulderOutStone SmarttTEConcussionQuestionableCam JonesLBHipQuestionableJaguarsParker WashingtonWRHipQuestionableWalker LittleOTConcussionQuestionableBrady Cook will start for New York with both Fields and Tyrod Taylor out.

Molden's potential absence could hurt on the back end while Pipkins' could force the Chargers deeper into their tackle depth. Johnston did not practice on Friday after being a full participant all week prior to that.The Chiefs have had issues getting open in recent weeks, and the absence of Brown won't help their offense get back on track. Kansas City is again incredibly banged up along the offensive line. And McDuffie's potential absence would be huge if he can't go. He was limited after suffering a knee injury during last week's game.\nBuffalo Bills at New England Patriots (+1.5)TEAMPLAYERPOSITIONINJURYSTATUSBillsChristian BenfordCBToeQuestionableTerrel BernardLBElbowQuestionableJosh PalmerWRAnkleQuestionablePatriotsTerrell JenningsRBConcussionOutRobert SpillaneLBFootQuestionableBenford was downgraded from limited on Thursday to DNP on Friday, which is usually not a good sign for player availability. Both Bernard and Palmer were limited throughout the week.Jennings' absence will leave the backfield work to TreVeyon Henderson and Rhamondre Stevenson. If Spillane can't go, that could hurt against a Bills offense that loves to run the ball and use multi-tight end sets to hit defenses with play-action passes.Washington Commanders at New York Giants (-2.5)TEAMPLAYERPOSITIONINJURYSTATUSCommandersJayden DanielsQBElbowOutDrake JacksonDEGroin/KneeOutJonathan JonesCBRibOutChris Rodriguez Jr.RBGroinQuestionableDeebo SamuelWRIllnessQuestionableGiantsBeaux CollinsWRNeck/ConcussionOutVictor DimukejeOLBKneeOutNic JonesCBShoulderOutRakeem Nunez-RochesDLAnkleOutKayvon ThibodeauxOLBShoulderOutJamie GillanPLeft KneeDoubtfulD.J.

The Commies could be even more shorthanded if Rodriguez and/or Samuel can't play. Rodriguez was limited throughout the week and Samuel did not practice on Friday.\nThe Giants have all kinds of issues up front on defense, which could be exacerbated if Lawrence, in particular, can't play. Lawrence was a late-week addition to the report, which is usually not a good sign. They could also be shorthanded in the special teams department without their punter and possible their primary return specialist.Las Vegas Raiders at Philadelphia Eagles (-11.5)TEAMPLAYERPOSITIONINJURYSTATUSRaidersAlex BachmanWRThumbOutKolton MillerTAnkleOutGeno SmithQBRight Shoulder/BackOutJeremy ChinnSBackQuestionableJordan MeredithC/GFootQuestionableIan ThomasTECalfQuestionableEaglesJalen CarterDLShouldersOutLane JohnsonOLFootOutKenny Pickett will start in place of Geno Smith.

McGlinchey was a late-week add and didn't practice on Friday. Bryant's absence will thrust Troy Franklin and potential Lil'Jordan Humphrey into larger roles as outside receivers.Detroit Lions at Los Angeles Rams (-5.5)TEAMPLAYERPOSITIONINJURYSTATUSLionsBrian BranchDBAchillesOutKerby JosephSKneeOutKayode AwosikaGFootQuestionableTaylor DeckerTShoulder/RestQuestionableThomas HarperSConcussionQuestionableChristian MahoganyOLFibulaQuestionableKalif RaymondWRAnkleQuestionableSione VakiRBThumbQuestionableShane ZylstraTEKneeQuestionableRamsDavante AdamsWRHamstringQuestionableDetroit has a number of injuries in the secondary, specifically at safety, which could be a big liability against the Rams. The injuries along the offensive line could be damaging as well, against L.A.'s strong defensive front. All of their questionable players save for Decker, who didn't practice, were limited throughout the week of practices. \nAdams is listed as questionable, but Sean McVay said he expects the receiver to play.Carolina Panthers at New Orleans Saints (+2.5)TEAMPLAYERPOSITIONINJURYSTATUSPanthersN/ASaintsAlvin KamaraRBKnee/AnkleOutAsim RichardsOTAnkleOutJustin ReidSKneeQuestionableThe Panthers have a clean injury report, with zero players listed as questionable, doubtful or out. Kamara will miss his third consecutive game.

They'll also be without their right tackle in front of either Philip Rivers or Riley Leonard, whomever makes the start under center.\nIf Seattle is without both Arroyo and Saubert, that could hamper its ability to use favored multi-tight end sets. Sundell has been out since early November but got in full sessions late this week, a potential good sign for his return.Minnesota Vikings at Dallas Cowboys (-5.5)TEAMPLAYERPOSITIONINJURYSTATUSVikingsTy ChandlerRBKneeQuestionableChristian DarrisawOTKneeQuestionableCowboysTyler GuytonOTAnkleOutJadeveon ClowneyDEHamstringQuestionableTrevon DiggsCBKneeQuestionableJake FergusonTECalfQuestionableChandler is still in the 21-day window to return from injured reserve.

FAU transfer F Tre Carroll's 30 points was another reminder of the match-winners on Pitino's Musketeers, who have improved 3-point shooting to near 37% after the X was hovering around 25% earlier in the season. Well-traveled G Richie Anderson III also scored 28 in a recent cruise past St Francis-Pa. Meanwhile, not sure how much progress Cuonzo Martin is making at Mizzou State, as the Bears have taken some lumps away from Springfield, such as the 98-74 loss at Tulsa last Saturday. Cuonzo's team also isn't helping itself with subpar 29.7% shooting beyond the arc.

Jaylon Tyson has started each of the last eight games that they have missed. In that role, he combined for at least 21 points and rebounds seven times. Helping his cause was that he logged at least 31 minutes in six of those games. The Wizards have the worst defensive rating and have given up the most rebounds per game in the league, which puts Tyson in a favorable spot to remain productive.\n                                    \n            \n    \n\n                    \n                                                                \n\n    \n            \n            \n            \n                Mike Barner\n            \n            \n                                    \n                    \n                                        \n        #4\n    \n                                    \n        \n            +285\n        \n        \n            (80%)\n        \n    \n                \n                                            4-1 in Last 5 NBA Player Props Picks\n                                    \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                                        \n                    \n                                                    NBA\n                                                CHI @ CHA • Fri 7:00pm\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n        \n        \n                    \n    \n                                                \n                    \n            \n                    \n                                                    \n                                K.

He should play a lot Friday with LaMelo Ball, Collin Sexton and Tre Mann all out. Ball has missed eight games this season and Knueppel recorded at least five rebounds in six of them. The two times that he didn’t, he had four rebounds each against two good rebounding teams in the Nuggets and Thunder. The same can’t be said for the Bulls, who have allowed the sixth-most rebounds per game in the league. When he played the Bulls a couple of weeks ago, he finished with five rebounds over 32 minutes.

Back to the Jaylon Tyson well we go. The sophomore has cleared this line in eleven of fourteen games when playing at least 24 minutes, and 8/9 without Jarrett Allen. With Allen and Sam Merrill remaining out, Tyson should continue to see a strong minutes floor tonight. It’s a soft matchup against the Wizards (for everyone on the Cavaliers), and one that should be played at a breakneck pace, with both teams in the top ten of tempo. \n                                    \n            \n    \n\n                    \n                                                                \n\n    \n            \n            \n            \n                Larry Hartstein\n            \n            \n                                    \n        \n            +38\n        \n        \n            (57%)\n        \n    \n                \n                                            4-3 in Last 7 NBA Player Props Picks\n                                    \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                                        \n                    \n                                                    NBA\n                                                CHI @ CHA • Fri 7:00pm\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n        \n        \n                    \n    \n                                                \n                    \n            \n                    \n                                                    \n                                S.

    "body": "\n        Brandon Royval and Manel Kape want the next shot at UFC flyweight champion Joshua Van. Royval and Kape have an important audition on their hands at UFC Fight Night on Saturday, the final event of 2025 before UFC moves to Paramount+.Royval (17-8) is the most exciting flyweight contender around. He holds the solo record for most Fight of the Night bonuses in the division's history, and is tied for most flyweight performance bonuses. \"Raw Dog\" is kicking himself for his recent loss to Van, a Fight of the Year frontrunner. On one hand, Royval wants to mature into a more thoughtful fighter. On the other hand, he wants to see if Kape has what it takes to survive a firefight.\"It depends on how I show up. I want to be smart and tactical, but my gut feeling is to put Manel Kape in a fight and see what the f-- is up with him,\" Royval told CBS Sports. \"I feel he hasn't been in a real fight in the UFC. No one has tested that part of him. In a fistfight, I bet on myself over the entire world. I bet I can outwill him. That's for damn sure.\"I fought Joshua Van as dumb as I could fight somebody. I knew I would do that. I wanted to box him in the pocket. I wanted to prove something. It didn't work out necessarily. That being said, I want to out-technique Manel Kape, but if it ends up in a fist fight, there's nothing wrong with that either.\"\nKape (21-7) warns Royval to think twice about brawling with him. Kape is one knockout away from tying the record for most divisional history. His precision is reflected in the statistics: better striking accuracy, defense, and takedown defense than Royval. Kape has won six of his last seven fights, and a win over Royval (No. 2) could put him in the perfect position to earn the next shot at Van.\"I've been [studying] Brandon Royval a lot. To me, it's like I'm  fighting someone familiar,\" Kape told reporters on Wednesday. \"In training, everybody wants to look like  Brandon Royval, imitate him, for me it's (the) usual. I'll be very comfortable on Saturday night.\"I'm just going to prove that I'm the man. I'm the fighter with the  better style to be a champion. I'm the fighter that this division  needs.\"  \nCheck out the full interview with Brandon Royval below.\nThe final UFC card doesn't stand out at first glance, but it is packed with interesting prospects. Kevin Vallejos (16-1) has only lost to Jean Silva, the current No. 11-ranked featherweight contender. Vallejos is the only person in 14 fights to go the distance with Silva in a competitive fight. He can join Silva among the featherweight elite with a win over Giga Chikadze. Also on the main card are IBJJF Hall of Famer Marcus Buchecha and Lance Gibson Jr., son of UFC veteran Lance Gibson. Hidden on the prelims is the UFC debut of former Bellator welterweight champion Yaroslav Amosov (28-1), taking on record-breaking welterweight veteran Neil Magny.Let's take a look at the rest of the fight card with the latest odds before getting to a prediction and expert pick on the main event below.\nUFC Fight Night card, oddsOdds via DraftKings SportsbookFavoriteUnderdogWeightclassManel Kape -140Brandon Royval +100FlyweightKevin Vallejos -340Giga Chikadze +270FeatherweightCezary Oleksiejczuk -205Cesar Almeida +170  MiddleweightMelquizael Costa -125Morgan Charriere +105FeatherweightKennedy Nzechukwu -192Marcus Buchecha +110HeavyweightKing Green -192Lance Gibson Jr. +160  160-pound catchweightUFC Fight Night viewing informationDate: Dec. 13 | Start time: 10 p.m. ETLocation: UFC Apex -- Las VegasTV Channel: ESPN2 | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)  PredictionBrandon Royval vs. Manel Kape: Kape has never fought five rounds. His closest experience is a fourth-round submission win on the regional scene 10 years ago. Royval puts opponents in deep waters and edges out decisions. Just ask Tatsuro Taira, who Royval beat by split decision last year. The terms for Saturday's fight benefit Royval more than his opponent. The question is how much success will Kape have early in the fight. He's more powerful and technically proficient than Royval statistically. Royval's wrestling has improved, but it hasn't been his bread and butter. A textbook \"Raw Dog\" brawl is Royval's best chance to win. However, I worry Royval's chin gets cracked in the process, or he loses too many rounds early to cover ground late. Pick: Kape via KO3\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 college football bowl schedule begins on Saturday with Boise State vs. Washington (-10). Even with the postseason landscape rapidly changing, college football bowl confidence pools remain popular, and there are 39 matchups to make college football bowl confidence picks on this season. The two biggest spreads are in the CFP First Round as Oregon is favored by 21.5 points over James Madison, while Ole Miss is a 17.5-point favorite over Tulane. While putting faith in big favorites is a part of just about everyone's college football bowl confidence strategy, correctly predicting an upset could help you separate from the pack.Anticipated matchups outside of the CFP include Penn State vs. Clemson (-4.5), Georgia Tech vs. BYU (-4.5), Tennessee vs. Illinois (+4.5) and Michigan vs. Texas (-7.5). The Wolverines will operate under interim head coach Biff Poggi after dismissing Sherrone Moore. The college football odds give you an idea of what sportsbooks deem as favorites and underdogs, but you'll need more than just those when making bowl confidence bets. Before making any college football predictions for bowl season, be sure to see the latest college football bowl confidence picks from SportsLine's proven model.New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $75 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times, and it is profitable on its top-rated money-line picks since the beginning of the 2024 season.  Anybody following its college football betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now, it has turned its attention to the latest college football odds and 2025-26 bowl season college football betting for confidence pools. Head here to see every pick. New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Top 2025-26 college football bowl confidence picks  One of the model's most confident picks is that No. 21 Houston, a 3-point favorite, gets a double-digit win over LSU in the Texas Bowl on Dec. 27. Not only is this game in Texas, but it's in Houston, providing the obvious home-field advantage for the Cougars, as LSU has lost its last four games outside of Tiger Stadium. Meanwhile, the Cougars are 5-1 straight-up when favored this season, and the Tigers' offense limps into this matchup as it has a total of four touchdowns over the last four games and won't have quarterback Garrett Nussmeier. That's the same number that Houston had in its last game, alone, as the model has the Cougars winning in 80% of simulations. See all of the model's college football bowl confidence picks here.Another one of the bowl confidence predictions the model is high on: No. 16 USC (-5.5) gets a comfortable win over TCU in the Alamo Bowl on Dec. 30. USC went 9-3 in the regular season, with all three defeats coming versus ranked teams. TCU found itself in the Top 25 once -- back in September -- before having a pedestrian run through the Big 12 schedule, finishing 5-4. Even with the Horned Frogs playing in the easier conference than the Trojans, USC both averaged more points and allowed fewer points per game. USC sports a 32-9 (78%) straight-up record when favored since Lincoln Riley came aboard in 2022, as it is projected to easily take care of business in San Antonio. SportsLine's model has the Trojans prevailing nearly 70% of the time. See the rest of the college football bowl confidence predictions here. How to make college football bowl confidence picksThe model has also made the call on who wins every other bowl game. There are 11 teams that win at least 70% of the time, so you need to go big on those matchups, as well as 15 underdogs that win outright. You can get all the model's picks at SportsLine.So who wins every college football bowl game, and which matchups should you assign the most confidence points to?

    "body": "\n        JuJu Watkins is fulfilling a dream by participating in her first USA Basketball Senior Women's Team camp. \"It was definitely like a pinch-me moment, even all the way back to when I got the invite,\" the USC sophomore said. Unfortunately, participation won't include hitting the court. Watkins is recovering from an ACL tear suffered in the 2025 NCAA Tournament. She announced in September that she would not compete in the 2025-26 season to focus on her rehabilitation and being a good teammate. Now, as a passive participant, Watkins is ready to learn as much as possible and bring those insights to Southern California. \"Honestly, it's enough just kind of being there and feeling the energy ... hearing everybody's voices, the communication, the leadership. I mean, it's just something that you can see and automatically it brings up your standard. So I'll definitely be taking some of those lessons back to SC to kind of continue to grow as a leader and as a player,\" Watkins said. Despite being in recovery, USA Basketball saw value in adding her into the fold. \n\"We wanted her here,\" head coach Kara Lawson told the media Friday afternoon after the first on-court session. Having Watkins, who both Lawson and USA Basketball managing director Sue Bird expect to be part of the future of the program, was a priority. From pre- and post-practice routines to recovery, the young star will have the chance to have a front row seat to the standards and culture. \"I'm hoping that by being around some of the top players in the world that she's getting, maybe through some osmosis, some really good lessons from these veterans,\" Lawson added. \"I think it's great for JuJu, who's obviously incredibly talented,\" Bird said Thursday. \"To get her used to what the national team is, used to being around these players, and then of course, used to being around the coaching staff.\" \nAlthough not how she envisioned her first senior camp, the young USC guard is ecstatic to be there. \"I've dreamt of being a part of this atmosphere. So to see that actually kind of come true, in a sense, and seeing that I'm headed towards the right direction is definitely satisfying,\" Watkins said. Watkins and UCLA center Lauren Betts are the only two NCAA players participating in the December camp. Washington Mystics rookie and former USC Trojan Kiki Iriafen says that speaks volumes to how the two are respected. \"Juju is still in college and she's one of two people that are here on the senior team,\" Iriafen said. \"She's a great spirit and we can't wait for her to be ready and back on the floor.\" \nSitting on the sideline is often seen as a setback, but perhaps this is a chance for Watkins to see the game from a different perspective, especially the habits and discipline required on and off the court when representing Team USA and competing with WNBA players. \"It looks a lot different from what I am used to with college. So for me, it's just kind of getting a feel for, like, what's going to be expected of me at the next level... that definitely helps bring up my I.Q as well,\" Watkins said. \n            ",

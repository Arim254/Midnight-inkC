    "body": "\n        The 2026 PGA Tour schedule gets underway at the 2026 Sony Open in Hawaii on Thursday, Jan. 15. The season opener at Waialae Country Club in Honolulu comes a week later than normal after The Sentry was cancelled this year due to course concerns. That means there will be just one event on the Hawaii Swing this year, and some top players decided not to make the trip. Big names like Collin Morikawa, Hideki Matsuyama, J.J. Spaun and Jordan Spieth, however, are among the golfers who are teeing it up this week.The latest 2026 Sony Open odds from DraftKings Sportsbook list Russell Henley as the +1100 favorite. Matsuyama and Ben Griffin are at +1700, followed by Spaun at +1800. Morikawa joins Si Woo Kim and Robert MacIntyre at +2000, with Keegan Bradley close behind at +2200 and Maverick McNealy at +2500. Spieth is +4500, just a bit behind defending champion Nick Taylor, who is +4000. Before locking in any 2026 Sony Open picks, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up over $8,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.This same model has also nailed a whopping 16 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- as well as this year's PGA Championship and Open Championship. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting sites. \nNew users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Now that the 2026 Sony Open field is locked in, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard. 2026 Sony Open predictions One major surprise the model is calling for at the 2026 Sony Open: Henley, the betting favorite, stumbles and barely finishes inside the top 5. He's a golfer to avoid this week. The 2013 Sony Open champion hasn't been able to follow up on that success at this event with regularity. Since that time, he's missed the cut twice and has three other finishes outside the top 30. Last year, he finished T10. He's played just once since last year's playoffs and finished 19th at the Procore Championship, so the model doesn't love his value as a favorite this year. See who else to fade here. \nAnother surprise: J.J. Spaun, a +1800 longshot, makes a strong run at the title. He's a target for anyone looking for a huge payday. The 2025 U.S. Open winner finished T3 in this event last year. He also brings some momentum into the new year after playing three times in the fall and finishing no worse than T11 in those tournaments. The model has identified him as a top-three contender this week, making him a golfer to back in your Sony Open best bets. See who else to pick here. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:How to make 2026 Sony Open picksThe model also has identified three golfers with odds of +2500 or higher as top-10 contenders.

    "body": "\n        UFC's Seattle return has its main event. Israel Adesanya vs. Joe Pyfer will headline UFC Fight Night on March 28.UFC CEO Dana White announced the fight, which streams exclusively on Paramount+, on Tuesday via Instagram. The card will also feature a pivotal women's flyweight showdown between Alexa Grasso and Maycee Barber.Former UFC middleweight champion Adesanya looks to course correct amid his first losing streak. \"The Last Stylebender\" finds himself on a three-fight skid after knocking out current light heavyweight champion Alex Pereira to reclaim the 185-pound title. Adesanya subsequently lost the title to Sean Strickland, before being finished by Dricus du Plessis and Nassourdine Imavov.Pyfer has made progress in rehabilitating his image. His reputation as an elite prospect took a hit after losing to Jack Hermansson in Pyfer's first main event. Since then, he's won three consecutive fights. A decision win over Kelvin Gastelum -- who gave Adesanya the most exciting fight of his career -- is sandwiched between Performance of the Night wins over Marc-Andre Barriault and Abus Magomedov.\nUFC visited Seattle last February, a card headlined by Henry Cejudo vs. Song Yadong. It marked the first time the promotion had visited the Emerald City in 12 years. Afterwards, White promised the promotion would be back soon.\n\"Let me tell you what, America, Seattle is an awesome city,\" White said during a post-fight press conference in February. \"The people here are amazing. We were walking around the area, lots of different people from everywhere. The shops they have here, the boutiques, the restaurants, the hotels, I forgot how awesome Seattle is. I'm so glad we came back to Seattle.\"White revealed that last year's sellout event at Climate Pledge Arena broke the UFC's North American live gate record for Fight Nights. The 18,000 attendees generated $3.84 million in revenue.\"We will not wait 10 years to come back here,\" White said.\nThe promotion has also booked former UFC women's flyweight champion Grasso against rising contender Barber. Grasso, who famously dethroned Valentina Shevchenko in the first of their three fights, is coming off a last to Natalia Silva. Barber is on a seven fight win streak, most recently beating Karine Silva at UFC 323.\n            ",

The challenge for Kim will be fighting off rust, as she won't be cleared to get back on a board until just before the Games begin in Milano Cortina on Feb. 6. \"I have good news and bad news. I'll start with the bad news which is that a tore my labrum, which I expected,\" Kim said in her video. \"The good news is that I just tore my labrum, and I guess there are two different ways to do it and the way I did it is less severe than the other. Obviously I'm really disappointed that I can't snowboard until right before the Olympics, which is going to be hard, I haven't gotten nearly the amount of reps that I would've liked. … But again, I'm so grateful that I will be good to go for the Olympics.\"\nLast Friday, Kim announced she dislocated her shoulder in her second day of training for the 2026 Winter Olympics. Kim posted a video to Instagram providing an update on her injury as well as video of the fall, which appeared to be a freak accident as her board got caught in the snow as she went up the wall of the halfpipe and she fell shoulder first into the face of the halfpipe wall. \"I'm currently in Switzerland, and on my second day training, I took the silliest fall,\" Kim said. \"And that ultimately resulted in me dislocating my shoulder. Just so fun.\"\n\n\nKim is an eight-time X Games gold medalist in superpipe to go along with her two Olympic gold medals, and figures to be among the favorites again in Milano Cortina. However, after pulling out of the final tune-up event with an undisclosed injury at the U.S. Grand Prix in December, her dislocated shoulder suffered in Switzerland creates an additional unwanted delay in her preparations for the Games as she aims for a gold medal three-peat. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Russell Henley enters the new season as the odds-on favorite to win the 2026 Sony Open in Hawaii. The American enters as the fifth-ranked golfer in the men's top 200. The former University of Georgia standout will be seeking his sixth PGA Tour win and ninth as a professional. His last win came at last year's Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay   Hill, Fla., in March. This year's event gets underway on Thursday at 1:49 p.m. ET from Waialae Country Club in Honolulu,  Hawaii. The tournament will be played on a par-70 course measuring 7,044 yards.

You can only see them here. Top 2026 Sony Open expert picks One of Kannon's 2026 Sony Open predictions: He's fading Tom Hoge, the 36-year-old TCU grad. He's +20000 in the outright market, and Kannon is staying away from him there and in bets like making the cut and head-to-head. \"The TCU Horned Frog has dipped to 99th in the OWGR and in five starts over the FedExCup Fall, Hoge missed the cut three times,\" Kannon said. \"In fact, dating back to the PGA Championship last May, Hoge has missed nine cuts over 15 starts on Tour. Hoge has played the Sony Open 10 times and despite a third-place finish in 2018, he has missed the cut four times. I am not banking on him returning to form just yet.\" See who Kannon is backing at SportsLine.Another golfer that Kannon is fading is Tony Finau, who is +1100. The 36-year-old turned pro in 2007 and has earned six wins on the PGA Tour, one on the Korn Ferry Tour as well as two others. He registered his last win at the Mexico Open in April 2023.\"It has been a tumultuous past year or so for Finau, battling legal issues and a golf game that saw him finish top-10 just one time in 2025,\" Kannon said. \"Approach play, Scrambling, Greens in Regulation, Putting – you name it, Finau has dropped to 125th to 150th territory in the Tour rankings across the board statistically. I imagine it will turn around for a player of his caliber, but I am not going to count on it happening just yet. In five prior visits to Waialae, Finau has missed the cut twice and never finished better than 20th.

    "description": "\n        Antoine Semenyo couldn't ask for a better start to his Manchester City career. Whether he can make the difference in the Premier League race ",
    "body": "\n        Antoine Semenyo couldn't ask for a better start to his Manchester City career. Whether he can make the difference in the Premier League race remains to be seen, but so far, so good. His goal helped break a deadlock and secure a 2-0 victory in the first leg of the EFL Cup semifinals away at St. James' Park. During the entire season, City's attack has been calling out for who would be the second player to look to in the attack after Erling Haaland, and while it's early in his City career, being able to get his first and second goal out of the way will bode well for upcoming Premier League and Champions League games.Rayan Cherki was able to add an insurance goal late, which will ensure that City have a two-goal advantage for the second leg, which will take place on Feb. 4 at the Etihad Stadium live on Paramount+.It's easy to look past Semenyo getting a goal in a match where City scored 10 at the weekend in the FA Cup, but in an away trip to face Newcastle, opportunities were hard to come by, and when City needed him most, Semenyo popped into space to deliver an all-important goal. Newcastle United limited Haaland's impact well, so someone had to step up, and while coming into the season, it would've been expected for that to be Phil Foden, it was the new man who made the impact.\nSemenyo's immediate impact shouldn't come as a surprise as he didn't score 10 Premier League goals with Bournemouth by accident, but his creativity also will bring more to City, too. A master of long throws, Semenyo also has three assists this season and will be able to add more playing with such a talented City squad. The Manchester derby looms this weekend with Manchester United just announcing Michael Carrick as their interim manager for the remainder of the season, and if Semenyo can score in a third consecutive match, he'll go a long way to endear himself to his new fans.City needed a player who could slot seamlessly into the attack alongside the creativity of Jeremy Doku, and they may have done just that. Defenders will be punished for devoting too much attention to Haaland, with a player like Semenyo roaming the wings will make things happen. Only two players, Igor Thiago and Haaland, have scored more goals than Semenyo's 10 in the Premier League this season as his hit rate from the wing has been nothing short of impressive in 20 matches played. The opposition will get tougher now playing in the Champions League, but his supporting cast will also improve with the switch to Manchester.\nAdding wingers hasn't gone well recently for Pep Guardiola with players like Savinho and Omar Marmoush struggling to settle at the Etihad, but the difference in Semenyo is that he's already a Premier League-proven attacker, so he only needs to adjust to the Guardiola way of life and not that and English soccer. Given this start, he's adjusting well to City, and who knows, the Premier League may feel like it's Arsenal's to lose, but the gap is only six points. If City can kick on and make things happen between now and the end of the season, they'll have every chance to reclaim the Premier League title, but any success will need Semenyo to keep his scoring touch going.\n            ",

That defense is special, but we've seen teams with good quarterback play have success against them. Allen was good last week against the Jaguars. The Bills have run-defense issues, but the Broncos don't run it well. That means it's all about Bo Nix. Can he make the plays to win it? I think in the end, Allen will make the plays to pull off another tough road victory.Pick: Bills 23, Broncos 21San Francisco 49ers (+7.5) at Seattle SeahawksSaturday, 8 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThis is a real challenge for the 49ers with all the injuries they've had to deal with, the latest being losing tight end George Kittle. The Seahawks beat the 49ers in the regular-season finale to lock up the top seed. That game was won by their defense. But left tackle Trent Williams didn't play in that one for the 49ers. That matters. I think Brock Purdy will keep the 49ers in this one, but the Seahawks will find a way to pull it out to advance to the NFC Championship.Pick: Seahawks 24, 49ers 20Houston Texans at New England Patriots (-3)Sunday, 3 p.m. ET on ESPN/ABC (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThis is all about the defenses. The Texans dominated the Steelers on Monday night, while the Patriots abused Herbert. The big edge goes to the Patriots offense. C.J. Stroud struggled against the Steelers, which is why Drake Maye has the advantage. Look for Maye to outplay Stroud as the Patriots win it in what should be a defensive-oriented game.  Pick: Patriots 23, Texans 17Los Angeles Rams (-3.5) at Chicago BearsSunday, 6:30 p.m. ET on NBC\nThe Rams didn't look great in beating the Panthers last week, but they found a way. The Bears rallied to beat the Packers. The concern here is both defenses. They have had issues as of late. The Rams have secondary issues. The Bears do as well. But the Bears don't rush the passer either. This will be a day where Matthew Stafford lights that defense up.

    "body": "\n        Speaking to the media days after firing John Harbaugh, Baltimore Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti said he hopes to have a Lamar Jackson extension done by the start of free agency in March, with the goal of lowering Jackson's $74.5 million cap hit in 2026.For reference, the highest cap hit in 2025 was Dak Prescott at just over $50 million.\"I want [Jackson] to be my quarterback,\" Bisciotti said. \"... The urgency of that matters to me because we've got free agents, and I don't want to go into free agency with that hanging over our head. And I made that clear to Lamar and I think he was very appreciative of my stance and hopefully willing to work with [Ravens GM] Eric [DeCosta] and not get this thing dragged out into April like the last time. It was very hard for [DeCosta] to build a roster when that thing is not settled.\"\"Like the last time\" is worth noting. Jackson, who does not have an agent and represents himself in contract negotiations, has stated multiple times that he wants to stay in Baltimore. But the last time the two sides worked on a contract extension, it took three years. Jackson was eligible for an extension in 2021, after his third NFL season, but the two sides didn't come to an agreement. In 2022, Bisciotti seemed to pin the lack of negotiations on Jackson.\n\"Unless he has a change of heart and calls Eric and says 'I'm ready,' Eric can't keep calling him and say, 'You really need to get in here,'\" Bisciotti said in March 2022. \"That's not a GM's job.\"In 2023, the situation reached fever pitch. The Ravens used the non-exclusive franchise tag on him, a move that allowed him to negotiate with other teams. A few days later, Jackson revealed he had requested a trade weeks prior as Baltimore wasn't \"interested  in meeting [his] value.\"Then in late April 2023, Jackson signed a five-year, $260 million extension with Baltimore.\n\n        \n            \n                Assessing past, present, future of Lamar Jackson, John Harbaugh, Ravens as contract negotiations loom\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBisciotti also said Tuesday that if the two sides couldn't agree to an extension, the team would lower Jackson's cap hit by spreading it into void years, though that's a far less desirable outcome.\"We want another window, and Lamar knows that,\" Bisciotti said. \"I think that he's amenable to doing something that mirrors the last deal he did, although the annual number will be a little higher. But I'm hoping that it's 'Plug a new number in the same contract he signed last year' and move on.\"The Ravens are coming off arguably the most disappointing season in the NFL, falling from preseason Super Bowl favorites to an 8-9 record and missing the playoffs entirely. Baltimore fired Harbaugh after 18 years and will look to reload around Jackson, 29. The two-time MVP, who missed four games due to injury, will be actively involved and have \"a lot of say\" in the hiring process, Bisciotti added.\n\n        \n            \n                What's next for the Ravens?

But with a week that has been a tumultuous one, the club needs anything that can take the spotlight off of Florentino Perez's power and the decision to move on from Alonso, so it's good that this match comes before a LaLiga one.Only trailing Barcelona by four points in the league, things are wide open for Arbeloa, but he'll also need to keep some of the good that Madrid were doing under Alonso. The defense was much more balanced under Alonso than they were under Carlo Ancelotti last season, and he also got Mbappe to play as a proper number nine. Resulting in 27 goals in all competitions, Mbappe will be central to any success that Madrid have.Moving on from Alonso shows that anything but a trophy is unacceptable this season, and the Copa del Rey will be Madrid's best chance at one. Already in the round of 16, it doesn't take much to be able to see a title in their future, but as long as they can get the Arbeloa   era off to a good start, it will be a job well done.\nImmense pressure is on the 42-year-old whose only managerial experience was with the Real Madrid youth teams and Real Madrid B, but he offers a change back to a world where Perez has the final say on what Madrid do. If Arbeloa   struggles, it'll open questions about whether Perez's way of running the club is still sustainable post Ancelotti, but only time will tell if that's the case.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Anthony Davis trade saga has seemingly taken yet another turn. While he had been in rumors ever since former Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison was fired in November, his recent hand injury seemed as though it could end all talks. With Davis likely out until at least March (even though he reportedly will not undergo surgery), the sort of win-now teams that would want a center who's about to turn 33 suddenly had far less reason to pay a steep price to get a deal across the finish line.Yet according to ESPN, the Mavericks are having renewed Davis discussions with multiple interested teams. The idea here would seemingly be for Davis to return during the postseason even after he misses a large chunk of time. If that all sounds a bit farfetched to you, well, it should. Players rarely return from significant injuries in the middle of the postseason. Even if they've recovered, their conditioning is practically never at the level it takes to meaningfully contribute to a postseason run. He'd have to come back during the regular season to get back into shape and integrate into a new team. For now, all we know is that Davis will be re-evaluated in six weeks. That is not the same as returning in six weeks. He might be ready in mid-March. He might suffer a setback that ends with a delayed surgery. Where Davis is concerned, significant risk is always in the picture.Remember, Davis is making $54 million this season. Any playoff team trying to acquire him would have to send out a similar amount of money to bring him in before Feb. 5. What team could afford to send out that much money and feel reasonably confident that it could even survive long enough to get Davis back? Would a diminished version of Davis even be worth the outgoing salary in the 2026 playoffs? There are too many questions here for a true contender to take this plunge.\nWhat this reporting really suggests is that the Mavericks are so eager to move Davis that they're willing to do so for a lower price than we previously believed. The question here is just how low they're willing to go. If they're willing to act as the Hawks did with Trae Young, for instance, and just dump the contract for expiring money, then the Clippers make perfect sense. They could send Dallas around $50 million in expiring contracts between John Collins, Brook Lopez and Bogdan Bogdanović. They'd need help from a third team, and the Clippers would not give up either of their two tradable first-round picks, but if the price is effectively cap relief, they're the only win-now team with the right combination of contracts and desperation to pull the trigger.But I don't think the price is that low yet. If multiple teams really are interested, that's enough to create, well, maybe not a bidding \"war,\" but perhaps a bidding \"skirmish.\" Even if the Mavericks lack external leverage, they certainly have internal leverage. They can just keep Davis, siit him out for the year, tank, get another high draft pick to pair with Cooper Flagg, and then bring Davis and Kyrie Irving back next season planning to try to win. Dallas needs to get something of notable value in order to justify punting on next year's upside, but we've covered why win-now teams would have a hard time justifying that kind of price. However, I do think there's a team near the bottom of the standings that makes sense, one that probably wouldn't mind shelving Davis this season, but should be eager to have him on next year's team.Why the Hornets are the best fit for Anthony DavisSince Dec. 1, the Charlotte Hornets have the No. 4 ranked offense in the NBA. They have a better net rating in that window than the Rockets and Knicks. This is no longer a fluke. Despite the early season LaMelo Ball trade buzz, the Hornets are building something real here. The core of Ball, Kon Knueppel and Brandon Miller will be ready to make genuine noise in the very near future provided Ball can just stay healthy. What that group needs is size and defense. That certainly sounds like Anthony Davis.\nFor a variety of reasons, the Hornets and Mavericks line up almost perfectly as trade partners. Consider the following:Charlotte controls Dallas' 2027 first-round pick, top-two protected. That pick is very valuable to the Mavericks because it opens the door to another year of tanking. However, it is less valuable to the Hornets, especially if Davis stays in Dallas, because they can't control what the Mavericks do. If their options are \"Dallas keeps Davis and is presumably good next year\" or \"cash that pick in now and improve ourselves,\" the latter appears more favorable.The Hornets can afford to trade a pick now. They have a surplus. In fact, they have an extra first-round pick in three of the next four drafts even ignoring the Dallas pick. This year, they're currently slated to get Phoenix's pick from the Mark Williams trade. They'll get Miami's pick next year from the Terry Rozier deal. Then in 2029, they'll get the least valuable of Utah, Cleveland and Minnesota's picks thanks to the Williams deal. In addition, they control all of their own picks.Speaking of their own picks, getting Davis now and sitting him out for the rest of the year would presumably help the Hornets maximize their own 2026 first-round pick. After all, they'd have to send out $50 million or so in salary just to get him. Those are players they could no longer use. Davis could help the Hornets add another premium young player.On that financial front, the Hornets have around $14.4 million in room beneath the luxury-tax line. The Mavericks, meanwhile, are around $16.9 million over the tax line. In other words, Charlotte could help Dallas get reasonably close to ducking the tax, likely within one more move. Most teams would be against taking on, say, the next year-and-a-half of money owed to Klay Thompson. It might make sense for Charlotte solely as a veteran mentor for their younger guards.And our last financial note: Davis reportedly wants a contract extension. Frankly, he lacks the leverage to get one at the moment. If the Hornets could make this trade without giving him one, that would obviously be preferable. However, Knueppel's rookie deal does give Charlotte a big more wiggle room to at least extend Davis for a single season if necessary. As long as he's off the books by the 2029-30 season, when Knueppel's presumably expensive rookie extension kicks in, that's what matters. And hey, if nothing else, Charlotte might not mind having a big expiring salary on its books in a few years. By then the young players might be so good that they're ready to make another significant trade in which Davis could eventually serve as matching salary.So what would a trade look like? I imagine something like this:Mavericks receive: Miles Bridges, Josh Green, Grant Williams, Pat Connaughton, Mason Plumlee, 2027 first-round pick (via Mavericks)Hornets receive: Anthony Davis, Klay Thompson, D'Angelo RussellDallas would have to take on around $50 million owed to Bridges, Green and Williams next season. However, it would save over $12 million this season. A Daniel Gafford trade elsewhere, or some other sort of cap dump, would get the Mavericks below the tax line. In the aggregate, Dallas would still save about $20 million next season as well, and then not have to worry about the $63 million or so owed to Davis for the 2027-28 season or any noise he might make about a possible extension. We'd likely need a third party to step in and take a minimum salary or two just to make the roster balance work, but that's always a solvable problem.Charlotte, meanwhile, would set itself up to enter next season with Davis, that core of Ball, Miller and Knueppel, and fellow emerging younger players like Sion James, Tidjane Salaun, their 2026 lottery pick, and incumbent big men Moussa Diabaté and Ryan Kalkbrenner. Those last two players are notable here. Diabaté has distinguished himself over the past year or so with incredible effort and strong defense. Kalkbrenner has a ways to go, but his size alone makes him a strong shot-blocker and finisher near the basket. Both are probably overtaxed in their current roles, but neither should be excised from the rotation, either.\nA Davis acquisition creates a more suitable middle ground. Their roles would likely be smaller with him in the fold, but not disappear completely. Besides, Davis misses his share of games. They wouldn't lack for opportunities to scale up. Given the shooting Charlotte has assembled, it's not implausible that Davis could play minutes with either of them. It wouldn't be ideal offensively, but Davis prefers defending forwards over centers anyway, so if some minutes with the other promising, younger big men in the fold placates him, well, that works out nicely too.The Hornets probably dug too deep a hole for themselves early this season to make a real playoff run this year. That's fine. This team is young. Another few months of development for those recent draft picks is still going to be valuable for these players. But it won't be long until Charlotte is genuinely ready to win. And when they are, it's just hard to imagine them finding a player that suits their needs better than Davis. If such a player even exists, he'd be substantially more expensive. Charlotte won't have access to the Giannis Antetokounmpos of the world. That's just the reality of their market recent history of losing. Jaren Jackson Jr. might make more sense on Charlotte's timeline, but he'd also cost several first-round picks.But Davis' star has seemingly fallen far enough for him to be attainable for the Hornets for a bargain. He's a basketball fit for their roster, and he'd represent a real vote of confidence in the core that they're building, a signal to the young players that the team thinks they're ready to start winning. Most of the evidence lately suggests that's true. They're just looking for that one last piece to push them over the top. Even if it doesn't come to fruition until next season, Davis makes plenty of sense as that final addition.\n'Why shouldn't the ______ trade for Davis instead?'Think about the teams that have most widely been reported as potential Davis suitors. Atlanta. Golden State. Toronto. What do those teams have in common? Right now, it's their status as postseason underdogs. The Warriors are a No. 8 seed at the moment. The Hawks are a No. 9 seed. Toronto is No. 4 in the East, but only three games ahead of No. 8 Miami.Now think about where those teams would be if they gave away $50 million or so in matching salary for Davis without knowing when he'd come back. Say Toronto gave up RJ Barrett and Jakob Poeltl, probably their best-case outcome in terms of players traded given their oversized contracts. Maybe they could get Davis back in time for the playoffs, but how far down the standings would they fall in the process? Would you rather be a top-six seed without Davis or a Play-In team with him? Even if they don't fall down the standings, how confident would you feel in the Raptors, say, winning a first-round series without Davis before bringing him back in the second round if that's what his recovery timeline calls for?Atlanta, as a No. 9 seed, would face two winner-take-all games before even reaching the postseason... and that's before considering the Hawks playing out the regular season without Kristaps Porziņģis or Luke Kennard, the two obvious pieces of matching salary that would be in the deal, plus whoever else they have to give up. Golden State would at least have a chance at redemption if it lost the first Play-In Game, but imagine the Warriors trying to sneak into the playoffs without either Jimmy Butler (who matches Davis' contract exactly) or basically all of their depth (Draymond Green, Jonathan Kuminga and a few other role players would be needed). Again, that's a tall order.\nThe reality for these teams is that they just probably wouldn't be able to survive an extended regular-season absence from Davis this season, and even if they made the postseason despite his injury, would be digging such a deep hole for themselves that climbing out would seem almost impossible. That makes a Davis trade more of a next season proposition, and if that's the case, what's the benefit of acting now? Wouldn't you rather scope out the offseason transaction market and see if younger, cheaper alternatives are available? Besides, these teams have other needs. The Hawks may have traded Trae Young for cap relief, but that doesn't mean they have enough shot-creation. CJ McCollum is a stopgap. Eventually, they'll need to pursue a younger scorer. That eats into their available money. Golden State needs to balance its present with its future. The Stephen Curry era won't last forever. Could the Warriors justify giving away draft capital deep into the future for maybe one or two bites at the postseason apple? That seems unreasonable. If they're giving up picks like that, it would ideally be for a player who could help keep them afloat after Curry retires.And then there's the desperation tier, teams like the Clippers and Bucks who are set on winning now but have very limited flexibility in pursuing upgrades. We covered the Clippers as a cap dump option, but if the Mavericks want genuine value, there's just no way for Los Angeles to offer it responsibly. A 16-23 team can't justify giving up either its 2030 or 2032 first-round picks for a 33-year-old. The Bucks are in the same boat. The idea here is improving enough to convince Giannis Antetokounmpo he can compete for a championship in Milwaukee. That's already a tall order. If they're giving up all of their matching salary for Davis, they just wouldn't have enough leftover to win with, and they'd be sacrificing draft picks they might need deep in the future to rebuild for life after Giannis.\nSo, really, the groups of teams that might make sense are the ones that could feel reasonably confident that they will survive long enough in the playoffs to actually get Davis back this season or the ones who would be adding him exclusively for next year and beyond. How many teams like that even exist? Boston needs a center but can't make the money work with Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and Derrick White on expensive contracts. Minnesota is playing too well to disturb its current group. Ironically, the best fit here might even be the Lakers. Just mash all of their expiring contracts together, throw in a 2031 first-round pick and call it a day. Dallas would never cooperate on such a deal. The public backlash would be too significant. There just isn't a viable contender for Davis in this moment.That means that younger teams like Charlotte who would have some reason to acquire Davis for the future are our best bets. But who else makes sense? The Nets have Charlotte's draft surplus, but are set at center with Nic Claxton and Day'Ron Sharpe, and they don't have Charlotte's offensive firepower, so they wouldn't benefit as much from Davis' presence. The Bulls badly need a defensive center, but their lone, extra first-round pick, a lottery-protected pick coming from Portland, isn't as valuable to Dallas as what the Hornets can offer, and besides, the Bulls have far bigger, long-term roster concerns to address. Unlike the Hornets, they don't have a viable core in place. A Pelicans reunion ironically makes some basketball sense. New Orleans could use a rim-protector next to Derik Queen in the Zion Williamson salary slot. But after the disaster of giving away their unprotected pick this season, New Orleans can't justify giving away any more first-rounders. Besides, Davis is so expensive that New Orleans would have to include more salary on top of Williamson just to make the money work. This is an organization that has never shown any interest in paying the luxury tax.The Hornets check the most boxes here. They're not the sort of team one would expect to pursue someone like Davis, but the fit is there if you're willing to squint for it. There has been no reporting on a possible deal between Dallas and Charlotte, and just given where the Hornets are on their rebuilding timeline, any trade for a player like Davis is inherently unlikely. But if the Hornets are willing to think outside of the box, Davis could really help this team transition from plucky upstarts to genuine winners as soon as next year.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        NEWARK, N.J. — For Dan Hurley's Connecticut Huskies, 2025-26 has become all about exorcising the demons from a season ago. No matter how those exorcisms happen.On Tuesday night, the hardest purging one yet.Last year's Huskies famously didn't get that unobtainable three-peat in 2025, but their chase for a third national title in four seasons is very much on thanks to their latest win, this one a vindicating 69-64 victory vs. Seton Hall on Tuesday. With the win, the Huskies are 17-1 overall and 7-0 to start league play for the first time since 1998-99 — the season of UConn's first NCAA championship.Now it's chasing a seventh. The path through the Big East looks significantly easier this season vs. last. Still, one the team's toughest tests came vs. the Pirates. No. 3 UConn was up by 18 points in the second half and seemingly on its way to a cruise-control road win against 25th-ranked Seton Hall. Instead, the Huskies succumbed to the Pirates' full-court press in the final 10 minutes and wound up narrowly escaping, winning despite 17 turnovers. \"These guys STICK to you,\" Hurley said. \"They're very quick.\"UConn's victory was ultimately aided by the fact that Seton Hall, which ranks near the bottom of 3-point accuracy among all Power Five teams (31.4%), was a season-worst 1-of-16 from beyond the arc. Connecticut was barely better, managing a mere 3-of-17 showing from deep. Seton Hall's only 3-pointer came in the final minute, when Pirates junior guard Mike Williams III hit a trey to cut the lead to two with 48 seconds remaining. Well-timed, but too little too late. \n\n        \n            \n                Kansas upsets No. 2 Iowa State: Jayhawks hand Cyclones first loss just days after Bill Self says 'we suck'\n                \n                    Kyle Boone                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Huskies' victory marked the first time in 58 months — since March 3, 2021 — that Connecticut beat SHU on the road. And it did it in escape-route fashion in the final minute. UConn point guard Silas Demary Jr. sank two foul shots with less than 30 seconds remaining to put the Huskies up 67-64. The Rock was thumping. Then Williams III tried another 3, only to have it blocked by Husky freshman guard Braylon Mullins. A scramble ensued. Who wound up with the ball underneath?Demary. He hit two more freebies to give the game its final score. A UConn team beating opponents by 16.6 points on average had to settle for a five-point edge, nearly blowing an 18-point lead along the way. That kind of twist can send Hurley into a fit against many teams and on many nights. But not this one. \nThat's because the Pirates are a viable potential NCAA tourney squad, at least in Hurley's view. \"That's a team that's going to compete at the top of the league,\" said Hurley, \"I wouldn't want to see Seton Hall's name drawn next to mine in the NCAA Tournament this year, I can tell you that.\"The Hall's rise has been one of the surprises of the season. SHU was picked last in the Big East in the preseason, yet no team at the Power Five level has jumped more in KenPom's ratings from October until now than the Pirates (50 spots: from 93rd on opening day to 43rd after Tuesday's loss). \nSweet revenge and a win to separate in-leagueTuesday night was about survival, Hurley said, and of course ending the road streak against his alma mater. UConn had lost its last four trips down to the Prudential Center — yes, including both NCAA title seasons under Hurley earlier this decade — and so this victory is surely a balm on his soul. Though he swears it wasn't something weighing on him until this past weekend. \"You're obviously not thinking about it in the preseason. You're not thinking about it in the summer. You're not thinking about it in October,\" Hurley told CBS Sports in the UConn locker room afterward. \"But then when you get to two days out and the media reminds you that you've lost four in a row here, and that chip gets implanted somewhere in the brain, you try not to think about that.\"Says who? With the comfort of heading home with a win, UConn senior forward Alex Karaban readily admitted he was thinking about it.\n\"A lot of anger just walking into this arena,\" he said. That anger was channeled appropriately in the first half, when UConn went into the break with a 35-22 lead. Karaban finished with 13 points and avoided an O-fer at Seton Hall for his lauded college career.\"It was never 'here we go again,'\" he said. \"It was staying together. It was similar to BYU in a way.\"Connecticut's win vs. BYU in November was another game that was won because of Demary's poise late. On the whole on this night, the most valuable player on the floor was Tarris Reed Jr., who had 21 points and nine boards. \n\"That's real against those guys,\" Hurley said of Reed's showing against Shaheen Holloway's team. \"I just have so much respect for how hard his teams play. His team may be the hardest-playing team in the country.\"Huskies can win in myriad waysIn a down year for the Big East (where questions linger about if the league can play itself to even four NCAA bids), Tuesday was a chance for Seton Hall to vault its national profile. This was the school's first ranked-on-ranked home game since Jan. 1, 2022. The comeback was impressive — UConn somehow only took one field goal attempt in the final five minutes, a feat that almost definitely will not be repeated the rest of the season — but the Huskies made just enough plays to get it done. A Seton Hall win would've been better for the Big East. UConn's on a tier to itself in the conference, though. It's winning in a lot of ways, including dramatics as of late. Last Wednesday, UConn overcame a 13-point gap with less than nine minutes remaining to slip out with an OT win at middling Providence. There have also been emphatic defeats over Illinois, Kansas and Florida.\nThe defense is closing in on efficiency numbers that are in earshot of the Hurley's two title teams.\"We've shown some special qualities,\" Hurley told CBS Sports. \"With our injuries and the schedule, and we've won well, but haven't played as well (lately). Especially at the offensive end and on the backboard, in terms of the turnovers, and some rebounding issues that I think are fixable with this team.\" Hurley said if the turnovers and rebounding get worked out, UConn is as strong as any team in the country with as good of a chance at the title as anyone. And he's right. The Huskies are 5-0 on the road. That's a better road record than anyone else in high-major basketball, and only second to Miami-Ohio's 8-0 mark. (The RedHawks are a college hoops-best 18-0 after their 100-61 win vs. Central Michigan win Tuesday.) \nThe Huskies have won 13 in a row since their shorthanded loss at home to No. 1 Arizona in November. It looks like this team's worst-case scenario in the Big East will be an 18-2 run of the regular season. Villanova and St. John's both are playing well, but beyond that, challengers will be hard to come by. When UConn lost in overtime at Seton Hall a year ago — vs. a SHU team that would finish with just seven wins — Hurley called the ride back that night a \"coffin on wheels.\"I asked him late Tuesday: What's the term for this year's trip back to campus?\"Grateful,\" he said. UConn has five Quad 1 wins, tied for second-most with six other teams. But those teams (Arizona, Nebraska, Vanderbilt, Iowa State, BYU) have a lot more opportunities in Q1 because their leagues are so much better and deeper than the Big East.\n\"There's not a lot of chances for us in the league this year to get Quad 1-type games games, to get Quad 1 wins, to get to beat teams that are going to be in the field,\" Hurley said. \"I mean, that's a team (Seton Hall) that's going to be in the field, that's an excellent team. It was actually fun to play a game that we could gain from. I think the group was probably a little bit looser, because it was a game that we could gain from, as opposed to a game that you lose, ow becomes a résumé hit.\" Seton Hall's improvement is huge for the Big East but also beneficial to UConn in this spot. The Huskies are the league's only title national title contender. The start of 2026 has been a bit bumpy, but all signs point to a return to supremacy when it matters most. The next two months will be about asserting dominance, taking back the Big East and positioning themselves for another run into April. Until then, Hurley will surely conjure up a few more demons to hunt.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        All bets appear to be off as Mike Tomlin has become the latest former NFL coach to leave his post. While many of his peers were fired since the 2025 regular season concluded, Tomlin was one of the fortunate few NFL coaches who was able to leave on his terms. That's what happened on Tuesday, mere hours after the Steelers' 2025 season came to an end after Pittsburgh lost its seventh straight playoff game under Tomlin. Tomlin and the Steelers' lack of recent playoff success somewhat overshadowed his overall body of work in Pittsburgh that included a Super Bowl win, two AFC titles, eight division titles, 13 playoff appearances and 19 straight non-losing seasons. Still just 53 years old, Tomlin will surely have his share of options regarding what he will do next. And while some potential options are more realistic than others, the recent turnover in the NFL should be a reminder to not rule anything out when it comes to Tomlin and what he might do next. \n        \n            \n                Mike Tomlin stepping away could give the Steelers the reset they need. It'll be easier said than done\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHere's a quick rundown of Tomlin's likely options as he charts out on a new path. \nCoaching in 2026 While many assumed that Pittsburgh would be his last team, Tomlin recently acknowledged on the Rich Eisen Show that he still loves coaching despite the obvious challenges that come with it. \"Hey, I'm institutionalized,\" he said. \"Man, I gotta have it. I just love the challenges week in and week out that this job provides. The growth in it, the collective growth, the individual growth. A lot of lessons that I've learned in life have been through my football experiences. I've been on the team every year of my life since 1980, and so I really appreciate it.\" In that vein, it shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone if Tomlin is back on the sidelines in 2026. And if he chooses to coach again, he will likely have his pick of several jobs that are currently open. Having the opportunity to interview for one of the league's current openings may have been one of the reasons why he chose to step down less than 24 hours after the Steelers' season ended. \nOne thing we know is that Tomlin doesn't want to spend time on a rebuild. There's a reason why the Steelers never had a losing season under his watch. He wants the opportunity to win now and every year moving forward. That means that Tomlin's next potential team would have to have a roster that is in position to win now. That could lead to the Atlanta Falcons, who are coming off two disappointing 8-9 seasons despite having several stars on their roster that includes running back Bijan Robinson, wideout Drake London, tight end Kyle Pitts, safety Jessie Bates III, and pass rushers James Pearce Jr. and Jalon Walker, among others. Quarterback remains a question in Atlanta, although the Falcons don't have a bad situation after Kirk Cousins showed major signs of his old form last year after replacing Michael Penix Jr. in the starting lineup. \nOutside of Atlanta, the Ravens would be another appealing landing spot. In Baltimore, Tomlin would have his coveted franchise quarterback in Lamar Jackson and a team that was a play away from defeating the Bills and reaching the AFC title game in 2024. While less appealing, the Browns could also be a possible landing spot for Tomlin. Unlike Atlanta and Baltimore, Tomlin would likely get a statue in Cleveland if he led the Browns to their first division title since 1989. While his consistent streak of non-losing season probably wasn't properly appreciated in Pittsburgh, it undoubtedly would in Cleveland. The Browns are coming off consecutive losing seasons, but they fielded one of the NFL's defenses last season and have an intriguing quarterback room in Shedeur Sanders and Dillon Gabriel. Those things could be selling points for Tomlin, who also wouldn't have to move very far if he ended up in Cleveland. \nThere's a major roadblock, though, which would likely prevent Tomlin from ending up in either Baltimore or Cleveland. That's the fact that the Steelers still own his rights, which means that Pittsburgh would have to approve and then receive compensation should a team try to land Tomlin, which leads us to our next scenario. A jump to media Similar to coaching, there's a belief that Tomlin would have his pick of several media jobs should he chose to go that route. While it probably wouldn't be as gratifying as coaching, a job in the media would allow Tomlin to stay close to the game while working significantly less hours and giving him the chance to showcase his impressive communication skills. Tomlin-isms have become the stuff of legend in Pittsburgh. His weekly Tuesday press conferences typically included some of his patented sayings (my personal favorite was \"When you have red paint, you paint your barn red\") that were often as humurous as they were insightful. \nIt might help that Tomlin's mentor, Tony Dungy, has enjoyed an extremely successful career in broadcasting since he left coaching nearly 20 years ago. Tomlin's predecessor, Bill Cowher, has also enjoyed a highly-successful career in broadcasting that has actually lasted longer than his time as the Steelers coach. From a legacy standpoint, there's no doubt that Dungy and Cowher's relevancy as broadcasters helped both receive induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. It would likely do the same for Tomlin, whose career in Pittsburgh largely mimicked the success that Dungy and Cowher had as coaches. A year offIn my opinion, this is the most unlikely scenario. For someone whose boundless energy became the stuff of legend in Pittsburgh, it's far-fetched to imagine Tomlin stashing that energy away for a year in lieu of some down time. \nThat being said, it is definitely possible that Tomlin takes a year to himself before making his next move. Coaching in the NFL is a grind, after all, and Tomlin might be ready for a well-deserved break. A year off would given Tomlin more time with his wife and three adult children. It would also give him some time to enjoy what he was able to accomplish in Pittsburgh before he delves into his next challenge. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Through the first three quarters on Sunday night, Anthony Edwards missed 10 of 16 shots and all four of his 3-pointers. The Wolves trailed the Spurs by as many as 19. Good players have bad nights, but great players are able to flip those bad nights in an instant. Edwards is a great player, and he relishes the responsibility of carrying the late-game load regardless of how things have gone to that point. \"I don't care what happens in the first three quarters,\" Edwards said on Sunday. \"...I feel like my teammates know, in the last four minutes of the fourth quarter, we giving the ball to [No.] 5.\" Indeed, Edwards got the ball in crunch time on Sunday and knew just what to do with it, hitting four of his five fourth-quarter shots including this sick fadeaway to give Minnesota its first lead of the game with 2:19 to play. \nA couple minutes later, Edwards put Victor Wembanyama into his bag, shook him up, and kissed in what proved to be the game-winner with 24 seconds to play. \n\"A few years ago, he probably shoots a step-back 3 over Wemby,\" Rudy Gobert said of Edwards' game-winner. \"He can make [the step-back], but it's not a super high percentage shot. Tonight, he was patient and poised.\"For a guy who can make any shot on the floor, deciding which one to take, and when to take it, can be a surprisingly difficult task. There's no wrong choice, necessarily. But there are better choices. This season, Edwards is making the better choices -- and when a player who possesses all the shot-making ability the basketball gods could possibly put into one body starts actually taking the right shots, results are going to follow. Following Sunday's performance, Edwards is shooting a remarkable 70.7% (57% from 3) of his shots in the \"clutch\" -- defined as any possession inside the final five minutes when the score is within five points. Nobody else who has taken at least 15 clutch shots is even close to those marks, and they are a huge jump from Ant's 37.5/29.9 combined clutch shooting splits over the previous three seasons. \n\"I think [earlier in his career], his decision-making at the end of games was a little too much hero ball, to be honest,\" Gobert said. \"I feel like he [now] values the ball more. He understands these possessions are really important.\"CLUTCH ANTTS%EFG%NET RATINGTOTAL +/-2024-2558.051.7-9.9-512025-2682.180.5+9.4+21This started on opening night. The Wolves, who are 11-7 in clutch games so far after going 20-25 last year, were trailing Portland with just over a minute to play when Ant dropped Jerami Grant on a step-back 3. On Christmas, the Wolves trailed the Nuggets by 15 halfway through the fourth quarter only for Edwards to score 11 points over the final five minutes including this fadeaway corner 3 to send the game to overtime. How about down two with inside a minute to play against the defending champs?\nThese are the types of shots that Inpredictable tracks as part of its Clutch Win Probability Added metric, in which Edwards ranks seventh league-wide and No. 1 overall based solely on made and missed field goals. By Inpredictable's count, Edwards has attempted 41 shots this season that have had an \"elevated impact on win probability,\" and on those shots he has posted a staggering 75.6 eFG%. You don't chart that kind of number just taking the highlight shots you just watched. To Gobert's earlier point, Edwards is recognizing how, and by whom, he's being guarded in crunch time, and when given a choice between contested jumpers and attacking -- as he did on Wemby -- when he has the advantage, he's more open to the latter. Here he is tying the game in the closing seconds against New Orleans:And here again with the Wolves down two in the final minute of overtime on Christmas:Only seven players have scored more clutch points in the paint than Edwards' 31 this season, and all of them have played in more clutch games. That's a testament to an all-around attack on the most pivotal possessions, when, as we've all seen far too many times, it is so easy even for the most gifted scorers to concede their inherent creative advantages and fire up 20-footers by default. Edwards doesn't play that game anymore. He plays his game. And he doesn't deviate in the clutch. If the jumper is the shot, he takes it. If the lane is open or he has the mismatch, he attacks it. It has been said of clutch hitters in baseball that they don't necessarily get better when the stakes are highest, they just don't get worse. In other words, they stay the same player regardless of circumstance. That's Edwards in now his sixth NBA season. He's had all the talent in the world from Day 1, but every year he has sharpened. He went from an inefficient shooter to leading league with 320 made 3-pointers a season ago at almost 40%. This year he's at 41% from deep with a career-high 62.6 true-shooting clip. If you double him now, he understands the power of getting off the ball and letting someone else tally both the bucket and the assist. Beyond the scoring and highlight dunks, these are all required steps in the pursuit of true superstardom. The one frontier Edwards had left to conquer was the clutch, and this season, at least so far, he's doing that. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Anyone looking for signs of Chelsea's era under new management would have been left wanting on Saturday night. The scoreline might have been more impressive than most in the dog days of Enzo Maresca's tenure, a 5-1 win at Charlton Athletic of the Championship, but this was still a team that hoarded possession and that was prepared to be patient in its pursuit of high quality chances.As Liam Rosenior explained after the game, he had doing \"nothing tactical, nothing technical\" with his new squad. The former Strasbourg manager believes he has inherited a \"good team\" that has been \"well-coached.\" This is not a club intent on reinventing the wheel.New manager, same Chelsea  Chelsea are not changing. No wonder. Those who can deliver the most profound impact on Chelsea's squad, their fitness, the tone of the club, arguably even the playing style are all in situ.There are at least five directors at Chelsea whose impact on the first team might be said to eclipse Rosenior's. Co-sporting directors Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley might have drawn the ire of supporters but CBS Sports sources suggest there is no evidence that those frustrations are shared by their employers. The most recent appointment, Dave Fallows, leads areas that include \"scouting and data, loans and player pathways.\" As with Winstanley and Stewart he is contracted until 2031.\nJoe Shields was appointed in 2022 as \"co-director of recruitment and talent\". Two years later Sam Jewell came from Brighton becoming the sporting director for global recruiting. This quintet were established as the sporting leadership team in November. Conspicuous in their absence from that list of power brokers was the first team head coach.That group is to say nothing for Behdad Eghbali, who has certainly taken a hands on approach to this particular slice of the Clearlake Capital portfolio. It is something of a ritual for Stamford Bridge regulars to see him walking across the field in the direction of the dressing room.A head coach with limited powerInto this fray, Rosenior will function as a voice among many. It would be wrong to suggest that Maresca was not consulted on Chelsea's transfer business but he did not have the deciding vote that it seemed was what he wanted. Take the near-season ending injury suffered by Levi Colwill in the summer. Maresca made no secret of his desire to supplement his squad with an experienced alternative and, according to CBS Sports sources, that was a market that was explored by the club. However, there was a high bar to be set for any possible replacement, particularly when the silver lining to the injury was the space opened up for Josh Acheampong to play more frequently.\nCome the summer, Rosenior will be able to offer input into whatever business Chelsea might conduct, but it will be input, not an overbearing voice. He should probably expect a fair bit of that business. After all, the most recent set of accounts show an annual amortization charge of around $250 million, the highest in the Premier League. A space will have to be found in the squad for Geovany Quenda, due to arrive from Sporting CP, while strikers Dastan Satpayev and Emmanuel Emegha are also signed up for the summer.Todd Boehly has previously spoken of Chelsea having \"a portfolio of players that are going to be consistent and reliable and have the potential to be together for a very long time.\" It now seems more likely that that will be the core of Rosenior's squad, the likes of Cole Palmer, Moises Caicedo and perhaps soon Estevao. Around them, expect the parts to be more interchangeable. In a matter of months Nicolas Jackson could go from Maresca's \"perfect number nine\" to a player Chelsea were eager to move on.If recruitment was one of the flashpoints between Maresca and his employers, though not specifically in the case of Jackson, the involvement of the medical department was another. Indeed it was said to be the intervention of that particular group that prompted the comments about the \"worst 48 hours\" that would set in motion events that ended in the Italian's sacking.\nThere is said to be a level of autonomy to the medical department that Maresca brushed up against. Then again, whatever Chelsea have been doing has worked well. Last season, when they did have the benefit of being able to win the Conference League with what often amounted to a shadow squad, they lost significantly fewer minutes than the likes of Arsenal, Manchester City and Tottenham to injuries. Club captain Reece James has been fit for an entire year.The input, let alone perceived interference, of sports scientists and physios in the decisions of head coaches and managers may seem like anathema to many in the English game but it is also an inevitable reality of an age of ever more football played at ever more intensity. If reports of clashing between Maresca and his medical team are indeed the case, Chelsea may be ahead of the curve in regards to the power of the latter. Sources within the game, however, expect others to follow.An American vision for an English soccer teamAnd while it might seem strange on English shores for head coaches to be overruled in questions of squad building and load management, it is perfectly normal State-side. Boehly, for instance, got the silverware bug at the Los Angeles Dodgers. Few who follow them more closely than this column would argue that Dave Roberts' voice holds the greatest sway at Dodgers Stadium.\nCertainly the broader march of the sport is in the same direction as Chelsea. There are ever-fewer elite coaches empowered with the authority that Rosenior's opponent on Wednesday night have. Mikel Arteta found an Arsenal bereft of purpose and imbued it with identity. The club hierarchy went to their-then head coach and asked him to be their manager. It seemed that Maresca had similarly lofty ambitions and that Chelsea's response was to invite him to explore those reported links with Manchester City and Juventus at his own leisure.Now if all of the above makes it seem like Rosenior will have nothing to do, that he is an inessential part of a broader operation, that would not be true. For starters, Rosenior must function as the public face of the Chelsea organisation. That will certainly be a challenge at a time when supporters are protesting against ownership vehicle BlueCo. So far he seems to have settled into that aspect of the role, publicly celebrating the \"limitless\" potential of the young squad he has inherited. Equally, he seems intent on carving out space for himself to operate within the sizeable org chart.\"I will make the decisions at this football club, that is why I have been brought in,\" he said in his introductory press conference. \"I understand, I am not an alien. I know what is being said. But there is no way you can be successful as a manager if you don't make the decisions for yourself.\"\nRosenior himself has set the expectation that he will not be reinventing the tactical wheel, but there was a notable upswing in the number of sequences with nine or more passes and a clear commitment to stretch the opposition with high, wide wingers. How much of this was a function of playing a struggling second tier opponent won't be clear for some time yet.There should however be time for Rosenior to show what he really envisions Chelsea being. He had a chance to prove his worth to BlueCo at the Strasbourg helm, following last season's seventh placed finish by guiding them to the same spot in the Ligue 1 standings again. Long term contracts might be the norm at Stamford Bridge but a deal through to 2032 is still a serious commitment. No manager has made it to year six at Chelsea since Dave Sexton, whose reign between 1967 and 1974 encompassed an FA Cup and a Cup Winners' Cup. Like so many of his counterparts under previous owner Roman Abramovich, Maresca might have proven that silverware is no guarantor of job security. It is still, however, the best route to fulfilling that lengthy contract.\"I'd love to be here for six years or longer,\" Rosenior said on Monday. \"I'd be here as long as possible but I'm aware in order for that to happen, I need to win. It's as simple as that. \n\"I understand every club has a different project. This word 'project' comes out a lot now in football. But the idea in any project is that every game you play, you're trying to win it. It's as simple as that. So for me, my focus is, yes, I've got ideas about what I want the team to look like in a year's time, two years, three years' time, but I think I've got enough resources and enough tools with me now to win. I've made that clear to the players.\"In that sense, while there might be new layers and different stakeholders to consider, Rosenior's job is not really all that different from any Chelsea head coach's over the last two decades. Where once it was Abramovich bequeathing the latest superstar, now it is the many cooks of the recruitment department trying to establish the ideal recipe. What will be asked of Rosenior is the same as was asked of Maresca, Thomas Tuchel or Jose Mourinho. Win an awful lot of football matches.\n            ",

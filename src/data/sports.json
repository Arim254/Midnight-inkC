    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL Championship Round takes place on Sunday as the Broncos host the New England Patriots (-4.5) at 3 p.m. ET and the Seahawks host the Rams (+2.5) at 6:30 p.m. ET. While one could pursue standard NFL bets like the spread and total with a Championship Round NFL parlay, you could also take a chance on plus-money predictions. Wagers like alternate lines, exact score predictions and NFL props often have huge returns, and stringing them together within a single bet could be an NFL longshot parlay worth pursuing.The Pats have won four straight games by double digits and now get to face a backup quarterback in Jarrett Stidham who hasn't thrown a pass in two years. If you expect another huge Pats victory, then you could back New England on an alternate spread as Patriots -13.5 has +242 odds at DraftKings Sportsbook. This could be a standalone bet or as part of an NFL longshot parlay prediction. Before making any Championship Round NFL picks or parlays, you need to see the Championship Round NFL longshot parlay from SportsLine's proven computer simulation that pays out $1.1 million on a $10 bet.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters the AFC and NFC Championship Games on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now that the simulation model has had a chance to digest the Championship Round NFL odds, it's locked in its betting picks to form a longshot NFL parlay that could pay out $1.1 million for a $10 bettor. You can only see the picks and full parlay by heading to SportsLine.Top Championship Round NFL parlay picksFor the Championship Round, one of the picks featured in the parlay is taking Denver's Zach Allen to have 1+ sacks (+191) versus the Patriots. Denver's 68 sacks led the NFL in the regular season and were just four shy of matching the all-time NFL record. Allen is the only member of this elite Broncos defense to be a First-Team All-Pro as the lineman had 7.0 sacks and lived in the offensive backfield. His 47 QB hits led all NFL players, even topping Myles Garrett, who set the single-season sack record.New England has allowed five sacks in back-to-back games, and just three quarterbacks were sacked more often than Drake Maye (47) in the regular season. Allen has at least 0.5 sacks in his last two playoff games, and this season he has three times as many sacks playing at home than in road stadiums. The Broncos are projected to have 4.42 sacks on Sunday, making this an NFL prop with great value to back. See the rest of the picks in the Championship Round NFL parlay here, and you can bet Allen to record a sack using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nHow to make NFL parlay picks for a payout of $1.1 millionThe parlay also includes six additional picks from the Championship Round from SportsLine's computer model, including multiple touchdown props that return higher than +400. You can only see the picks and the full parlay at SportsLine.What are the top NFL picks for the Championship Round that can be combined into a parlay that returns $1.1 million on just a $10 bet, and what optimal touchdown scorer bets should you be all over?

Lee was born in Japan but is of Korean descent and spent the first seven years of his professional baseball career in KBO (Korea Baseball Organization). \"Earlier today, Jung Hoo Lee experienced a brief travel issue at LAX due to a paperwork issue,\" the Giants said in a statement. \"The matter was quickly clarified with the appropriate authorities and he has since been cleared to continue his travel. We appreciate the professionalism of all parties involved.\"\nLee was not traveling with any contraband and his detention was not political, Giants general manager Zack Minasian told The Athletic.Lee, 27, hit .266/.327/.407 (110 OPS+) with 31 doubles, 12 triples, eight home runs, 55 RBI, 73 runs, 10 steals and 1.7 WAR last season with the Giants. It was his second season stateside and his first as a starter getting regular playing time. The Giants finished 81-81 and missed the playoffs for their fourth straight season.\nHe is scheduled to appear at Giants Fanfest on Saturday before the team heads to spring training. Lee is also set to play for Korea in the World Baseball Classic.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        NFL DFS players will have their final multi-game slate of the year as Championship Sunday brings both the AFC Championship Game and the NFC Championship Game. The Broncos and Patriots play at 3 p.m. ET, followed by Seahawks vs. Rams at 6:30 p.m. ET. Injuries will play a big part in both matchups with Bo Nix (ankle) out for Denver and Zach Charbonnet (ACL) out for Seattle. Denver, especially, will have a new look on offense and daily Fantasy football players will have to craft a strategy around how to value backup Jarrett Stidham and the rest of the that offense without Nix. The latter's absence could affect the likes of Courtland Sutton, Marvin Mims and Evan Engram.Who are the best NFL DFS picks for Sunday, and which sleepers can differentiate your NFL DFS lineups on sites like DraftKings and FanDuel? Before making any NFL daily Fantasy picks on Sunday, be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure.McClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings.

He's now had three straight weeks with multiple carries, giving him even more daily Fantasy value.

    "body": "\n        With Nikola Jokic (knee) out, Jamal Murray has been the focal point of the Denver Nuggets offense, and he'll look to keep the franchise afloat again on Thursday on the road against the Washington Wizards. Murray has averaged 30.8 points since returning to the lineup on Jan. 13, and has scored 28 points or more in four of five games. However, the latest NBA player prop odds list his over/under for total points tonight at 27.5, with BetMGM and Fanatics Sportsbook both offering a -110 payout. The SportsLine Projection Model is predicting Murray scores 29.4 points on average, and includes the Over among its NBA best bets on Thursday.Targeting NBA player props will be a popular way to approach Thursday's NBA betting at online sports betting sites. With NBA odds available for almost every player in every game at sportsbooks, the model can help you find value to add to your Thursday NBA picks at various sportsbooks.

He's averaging 28.7 points and 8.8 assists since that point and has been shooting 56.0% from the floor and 50.0% from the 3-point line over his last five games. The model predicts that he scores 29.4 points on average and is happily taking the -113 payout from DraftKings.Bet on Murray with the latest DraftKings promo code, which gives new users $300 in bonus bets if their first $5 wager wins:Joel Embiid, 76ers, Under 8.5 rebounds (-140) The 76ers have understandably wrapped the former NBA MVP in bubble wrap this season after he played a combined 58 games in the previous two campaigns. He's only played 23 contests this season, and he's averaging 7.0 rebounds per game while playing as more of a stretch five than ever. Philadelphia will host Houston on Thursday, and the Rockets are one of the best rebounding teams in the NBA, ranking first in offensive rebound percentage (37.0%) and seventh in defensive rebounding percentage (74.0%).

However, his 7.6 assists per game is slightly above his career average, and his seven assists on Wednesday were the only redeeming element on a 1-for-15 shooting night. Charlotte will take on Orlando tonight, and the Magic are middle of the road defensively (13th in points allowed and defensive rating). The model predicts that Ball finishes with 6.9 assists on average, making this plus-money play a savvy move.Bet on Ball with the latest BetMGM bonus code, which gives new users up to $1,500 back in bonus bets if your first bet loses: Want more Thursday NBA picks?You've seen the model's NBA picks for some popular NBA player props for Thursday. Now, get against the spread, total and money line picks for every game here, all from the model that's simulated every game 10,000 times. Also at SportsLine:NBA expert Prop Bet Guy is 51-36 (+950) in his last 87 NBA player prop picks this season.

    "body": "\n        The American Express 2026 is the second event of the PGA Tour season, but the first to feature the reigning four-time Player of the Year in Scottie Scheffler. He and the rest of the field will tee off on Thursday, with the first tee times coming at 11:30 a.m. ET, from La Quinta Country Club, and Scheffler could figure into several PGA props or a golf parlay. He's the +300 favorite, per the latest 2026 American Express odds, despite never previously winning across five starts at this event. Thus, seeking out others to either top the leaderboard or have high finishes could be part of an American Express longshot parlay, especially since no other golfer is at +2000 or lower in the latest PGA odds.Andrew Landry has both a victory and a runner-up at this tournament, and he's at +25000 to simply record a top-10 finish, per the latest golf props, and at +500000 to win. That could be a standalone bet or one leg in what could be a lucrative PGA Tour parlay. From outright winners to top 10 finishes to even wagering on there being an ace, there are lots of options to consider. Before making any 2026 American Express picks or golf parlays, you need to see this PGA Tour parlay from the proven computer model at SportsLine.SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up over $8,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.This same model has also nailed a whopping 16 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- as well as this year's PGA Championship and Open Championship. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting sites. \nNew users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Now that the 2026 American Express field is locked in, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times. It has locked in betting picks to form a 5-leg golf parlay that pays out nearly $70,000 for a $10 bettor. See the picks and full parlay by heading to SportsLine.Top 2026 American Express   parlay, PGA Tour picksFor the American Express 2026, one of the picks featured in the model's 5-leg PGA Tour parlay is Kurt Kitayama to have a top 10 finish at +360. Kitayama is coming off his best season on tour as he picked up his second victory and finished a career-best of 35th in the final standings. For the third straight year, Kitayama notched four top-10 finishes, including at a pair of courses that check in at under 7,300 yards at TPC Deere Run and TPC Southwind. That's relevant for the American Express, as La Quinta Country Club is just 7,060 yards, making it the fourth-shortest course in use for the 2026 season.\nHis length off the tee works in his favor on short courses as Kitayama ranked fifth in driving distance last season. However, he also has a nice touch with irons, as he was also in the top 10 on tour in strokes gained: tee-to-green. Kitayama played this event last year, and while he didn't have the best showing, he did shoot par or better in all four rounds. That experience should be invaluable this week as the model has him notching a top-10 finish (+360) despite his +4500 longshot odds to outright win. See the rest of the PGA Tour parlay legs here.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:How to make PGA Tour parlay picks The model has also picked an outright winner, plus a prop that returns +700 among its five PGA Tour picks for the 2026 American Express   parlay that pays almost $70,000 on just a $10 bet. You can only see the picks and the full parlay at SportsLine.\nSo, who will win the 2026 American Express, and what combination of PGA Tour props could unlock nearly a $70,000 payday on just a $10 bet?

    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL playoffs are down to the final four teams, with the 2026 Championship Round NFL schedule taking place on Sunday. Both No. 1 seeds will host, though one is a favorite and one is an underdog, per the Championship Round NFL odds via DraftKings Sportsbook. Seattle is giving 2.5 points to the Rams in the NFC title game at 6:30 p.m. ET, and the Seahawks have made the Super Bowl in each of its three previous times being a top seed. However, the first Super Bowl participant will come from the AFC Title Game at 3 p.m. ET, and the top-seeded Broncos are 4.5-point home underdogs to utilize in Championship Round NFL picks. That makes Denver the biggest conference championship home dog of all-time.Of course, Bo Nix (ankle) being done for the year has much to do with this Championship Round NFL spread as Denver's new starting quarterback, Jarrett Stidham, hasn't thrown a pass in two years. The Broncos do have the rest edge, and Drake Maye had four total fumbles plus an interception against Houston last week. Thus, there's lots to consider before making any NFL playoffs bets for the title games. All of the updated Championship Round   NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Championship Round   NFL picks now.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters the AFC and NFC Championship Games on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now, it has turned its attention to the latest Championship Round NFL odds and NFL betting lines and locked in betting picks for every NFL matchup. Head here to see every pick. Top Championship Round   NFL predictionsOne of the model's strongest Championship Round   NFL picks is the Under (42.5) hits in Patriots vs. Broncos at 3 p.m. ET. Denver has been an underdog five times this season, and the Under has hit in four of those games. Meanwhile, the Pats have failed to reach the total in four of their last six games as an away favorite. With Nix out, the Broncos' offense will take a step back, but Sean Payton will also adjust his game plan and run the ball more to eat up the clock. For the Pats, Maye has looked shaky during the postseason with six total fumbles (three lost), two interceptions and getting sacked 10 times across two games. Thus, many New England drives end up in kicks, or turnovers, which prevents the scoring running up. The model has the teams combining for 40 points as the Under hits in well over 50% of simulations. See which other teams to pick here, and bet the Under using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nHow to make Championship Round   NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in both games of the Championship Round   NFL schedule, and it has two A-rated picks, including one versus the spread. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine.So what NFL Championship Round picks can you make with confidence, and which A-rated picks should you lock in now?

    "body": "\n        Scottie Scheffler makes his season debut as the odds-on favorite to win the 2026 PGA American Express golf tournament. The world's top-ranked golfer is looking to win his 20th PGA tournament since turning pro in 2018. Scheffler, 29, last won at the Procore Championship last September in Scottsdale,  Ariz. He won by one stroke over fellow American Ben Griffin. This year's event gets underway on Thursday at 11:30 a.m. ET from La Quinta Country Club in La Quinta, Calif. Scheffler, who tees off in a pairing with Justin Rose at 12:14 p.m. ET, is the +300 favorite (risk $100 to win $300) at FanDuel Sportsbook. Other favorites include Ben Griffin at +2000 and Ludvig Aberg and Russell Henley both at +2200. Sepp Straka is at +4500 to repeat as winner at this event. Before making any 2026 American Express picks, you need to see the 2026 American Express predictions and best bets from golf expert Brady Kannon. Kannon is an elite golfing betting handicapper with more than 30 years of experience in the industry. He's hit eight major outright winners since 2013. In the fall of 2022, he hit outright winners in three consecutive weeks: Russell Henley (40-1), Tony Finau (18-1) and Adam Svensson (150-1). Last season, he hit Hideki Matsuyama (22-1), Harris English (110-1), Ludvig Aberg (25-1) and Ben Griffin/Andrew Novak (25-1) in New Orleans. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:\nNow, Kannon has focused his attention on the 2026 American Express field and locked in his best bets and top sleepers. You can only see them here. Top 2026 American Express expert picks One of Kannon's 2026 American Express predictions: He's completely fading Wyndham Clark, who is going off to 80-1. He's avoiding him in outright bets and advises to go against him in head-to-head bets as well.\"Clark did not play in Hawaii and missed the cut in his last regular Tour start back in early November,\" Kannon said. \"He finished 13th here at the Amex in 2022 but otherwise hasn't been better than 39th and missed the cut here last season. He is losing strokes both off the tee and on approach in each of his last five starts. Last season, Clark ranked 154th on Tour in Strokes Gained: Approach and 160th in Driving Accuracy. I also wonder if Clark's feelings of frustration regarding Brooks Koepka's return to the PGA Tour could still be a lingering distraction as he makes his season debut. I did find one head-to-head matchup with Clark as an underdog to J.T. Poston and yes, I would play the favorite against our fade player of the week.\" See who Kannon is backing at SportsLine.\nNew users can also check out the latest bet365 bonus code to get $200 in bonus bets after placing a $5 bet:How to make 2026 American Express picksKannon has revealed his best bet, and it's a surprising golfer going off at nearly 100-1.

These teams played two thrilling games during the regular season, but this game is for all the marbles, as the winner advances to Super Bowl LX and the loser goes home. At DraftKings Sportsbook, the Seahawks are the +145 favorite to win the Super Bowl while the Rams are right behind them at +230. It's safe to say the winner of this game is expected to go on to win the NFL championship.Here's a look at what fans and bettors need to know for Sunday's NFC Championship Game between the Rams and Seahawks, including the latest odds, model picks, injury reports and weather conditions. All odds are from DraftKings.Rams at Seahawks (6:30 p.m. ET)\nSpread: Seahawks -2.5Money line: Rams +130, Seahawks -155Total: 46.5 (Over -115, Under -105)At one point this season, the Rams were 9-2 and on their way to the No. 1 seed in the NFC. Los Angeles would lose a road game at Carolina, part of a five-game stretch where the team lost three games. One of those losses was an overtime game against the Seahawks in which the Rams blew a 16-point lead. That result ultimately cost them the top seed and gave Seattle homefield advantage for the playoffs. Matthew Stafford is trying to cap off his MVP-level season with another Super Bowl win and will be playing in his second NFC title game, while head coach Sean McVay is appearing in his third. The Rams got Davante Adams back from a hamstring injury for the playoffs but he has not been able to find the end zone despite leading the league in touchdown receptions. McVay said he expects Byron Young and Emmanuel Forbes Jr., two starters on L.A.'s defense, to be fine for the championship game after both suffered injuries in the win over the Bears. The Rams won the Wild Card game against the Panthers 34-31 and then outlasted Chicago 20-17 in overtime to make the NFC title game.Bet on the Rams to defeat the Seahawks in the NFC Championship Game at DraftKings, where new users can get $300 in bonus bets if their first bet of $5 or more wins:\nSeattle had a much easier path to the NFC Championship game, demolishing the San Francisco 49ers from the jump. Rashid Shaheed took the opening kickoff to the house and the Seahawks never looked back. They'll have fond memories of their overtime win against the Rams in Week 16, part of a seven-game winning streak. The Seahawks could've swept the Rams in the regular season but Jason Myers missed what would've been a game-winning field goal in a 21-19 L.A. win in Week 11. Sam Darnold, who battled an oblique injury in the win over San Francisco, threw four interceptions in that contest and has had problems against the Rams in recent games. It was L.A. who sacked Darnold nine times in last year's playoff game when the quarterback was with the Vikings, ultimately pushing him out of Minnesota. The Seahawks won't be complaining much, as Darnold steered an offense which was tied for seventh in yards per game and ranked third in points per game. However, Seattle's calling card is defense. Head coach Mike Macdonald has built one of the best defensive units in the league, and that alone could carry Seattle to the Super Bowl. The Seahawks were the best scoring defense in the league and did bottle up the Rams successfully once, but also surrendered 37 points in the second matchup. The Seahawks will be without running back Zach Charbonnet for the rest of the year but could be getting some reinforcements on the offensive line with Josh Jones and Charles Cross both potentially being able to suit up.Temperatures in Seattle are expected to be in the mid 40s at kickoff and there's no precipitation in the area, which likely gives the Rams a slight edge. Los Angeles struggled to deal with the elements in Carolina and Chicago in these playoffs. The SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every game 10,000 times, sees the Seahawks covering the 2.5-point spread in 58% of simulations, good for an \"A\" grade. The model has Seattle winning outright in 62% of simulations and Under hits in 55% of simulations. Back the Seahawks to cover the spread against the Rams at DraftKings:\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                                            ",

    "body": "\n        The most relatable thing about Bayern Munich is that they, probably like many of us, have gotten off to a sluggish start after the holiday break. First halves have always gone according to plan for Vincent Kompany's side, conceding first in each of their last two matches against Cologne and RB Leipzig and finding themselves level at 1-1 by the 13th minute in the first game of the new year against Wolfsburg.The good news on Wednesday in the UEFA Champions League is that Bayern had not conceded to Union Saint-Gilloise, but the Belgian visitors had grown into the match and were starting to string together an impressive defensive showing. They had limited Bayern to just one shot on target and 0.75 expected goals, their third straight game in which they could not crack more than one expected goal despite a reputation for slinging goals into the back of the net at an audacious rate, Vincent Kompany's side already on track for the greatest single-season goal tally in the Bundesliga's history. Perhaps the pressure of the German league's best-ever Hinrunde, or first half of a season, has a way of weighing down on a team, no matter how dominant they are.And yet, as Union learned the hard way and Leipzig and Cologne did before them, Bayern always find a way to regress toward the mean.The German champions notched yet another win on Wednesday, scoring twice in the second half against Union and becoming one of two teams to secure direct passageway to the round of 16 with a game to spare in the league phase. Bayern have a trademark way of wearing teams down, correcting course in the second half when need be. Wednesday's Champions League clash offered a perfect example – Union went from a defensively resilient team to one that conceded on the simplest of chances, the first a basic header from Harry Kane in the 52nd minute.\nKane, one of the greatest goalscorers of his generation, is a terrific thematic fit for this version of Bayern because he cannot help but overpower an opposing defense time and time again. Moments later, he forced Union goalkeeper Kjell Scherpen into a foul that led to a penalty, the England captain coolly finishing off the opportunity from the spot.\nIt was enough to survive the chaos that followed, first Kim Min-jae's second yellow card in the 63rd minute and Kane's missed penalty in the 81st minute, a rare sighting from the uber-clinical forward. The surprise developments, though, came with a stark reminder of Bayern's abilities – Kompany's side can handle many of the punches that a title challenge can throw at them, making them perhaps the greatest challenger to Arsenal as the road to May's Champions League final begins to kick into high gear.\nKompany's Bayern, like many previous editions of the team, tend to blaze past a range of German and European teams anchored by their historic dominance, but the one-dimensional version of Bayern in recent years has given way for a layered team that have multiple ways of grinding opponents down. Kane's multidimensional style suits Bayern well but these days, he is far from their only option in attack. He has help from Michael Olise, who notched the assist to his first goal and has 16 goals and 18 assists across all competitions this season, while newcomer Luis Diaz is not all that far behind with 14 goals and 10 assists. Kompany has also benefitted from the rise of 17-year-old Lennart Karl, who has seven goals and two assists this campaign and joined the more senior trio in the lineup on Wednesday, a strong fit for a team developing a reputation in the Bundesliga for steamrolling the rest.For all their skill, Kompany's Bayern are also willing to do the grunt work when the game calls for it, a tendency to be relentless in their pursuit of victory making up some of the intangibles needed to be a team that rises above the rest. It is a multi-dimensional style that will allow them to surpass most tests they will face, most impressively with a 2-1 win at Paris Saint-Germain in November, in which they announced themselves as Champions League contenders. A deep run now has to be the expectation for Bayern, but winning the title for the first time in six years does not feel too ambitious.\nLast season's edition of the Champions League demonstrates that it is too early to pick out eventual champions, especially once the knockouts begin. The title may still be Arsenal's to lose and their win over Bayern earlier in the league phase demonstrates just that but Kompany's side still feel like the most genuine competitor of any in the competition, and at the very least are on pace to restore the team's position as a European heavyweight.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Mets have bolstered their rotation with one of the top starters in the game. New York is set to acquire two-time All-Star Freddy Peralta in a four-player trade with the Milwaukee Brewers, the teams announced late Wednesday. Pitcher Tobias Myers is also going to the Mets, while prospects Brandon Sproat and Jett Williams are headed back to Milwaukee.Peralta, 29, is the latest big-name Brewer to get traded away one year prior to free agency, joining Corbin Burnes and Devin Williams. Milwaukee picked up Peralta's bargain $8 million club option earlier this offseason, but once Brandon Woodruff accepted the $22.025 million qualifying offer, the club ran into payroll issues. The Peralta trade clears money and adds talent.\nThis past season was a career year for Peralta, who finished fifth in the National League Cy Young voting. He made 30 starts for the third straight season and set new career bests in wins (17), innings (176 ⅔), ERA (2.70), and WAR (5.5). That 5.5 WAR was fourth in the NL and eighth among all pitchers. Peralta is, unquestionably, one of the game's best starting pitchers.With the Mets, he will headline a rotation that includes some combination of standout rookie Nolan McLean, Jonah Tong, Clay Holmes, Sean Manaea, David Peterson and Kodai Senga. President of baseball operations David Stearns, who worked with Peralta in Milwaukee, had been vocal about his wish for a frontline starter for the 2026 season.\n\"Acquiring Freddy adds another established starter to help lead our rotation,\" Stearns said in a statement. \"Throughout the offseason, we sought to complement our rotation with another front-end pitcher, and we're thrilled we are able to bring Freddy to the Mets.\"This caps a busy offseason for the Mets, which also saw them add Bo Bichette, Marcus Semien, Luis Robert Jr., Jorge Polanco, and others while bidding adieu to mainstays like Pete Alonso, Jeff McNeil, Brandon Nimmo, and Edwin Díaz.Even after trading away their ace, the NL Central champion Brewers boast impressive rotation depth. Their rotation depth chart currently looks like this:\nRHP Brandon WoodruffRHP Jacob MisiorowskiRHP Quinn PriesterRHP Chad PatrickRHP Logan HendersonLHP Robert GasserLHP DL HallWith a typical Peralta season in 2026, the Mets will be able to make him the qualifying offer next offseason and receive a compensation draft pick should he sign elsewhere. That would offset the trade cost a bit. And, of course, there is always the possibility of a long-term extension, which is preferable to a compensation draft pick.Peralta is entering the final option year of a five-year, $15.5 million contract extension he signed in February 2020. That contract included $8 million club options for both 2024 and 2025, making Peralta one of the game's top pitching bargains.Myers, 27, made six starts and 16 relief appearances for the Brewers in 2025. Over parts of two MLB seasons, he has an ERA+ of 132 and an FIP of 3.92 in 188 ⅔ innings. \nAs for the Brewers' side of things, the outfielder Williams was ranked by CBS Sports as the No. 14 prospect in the National League East. Here's part of R.J. Anderson's write-up: \"Williams will test your preconceived notions. He's a 5-foot-7 speedster who has experience at all three up-the-middle positions. Yet his offensive game isn't built on a strong foundation of bat-to-ball skills. Rather, he's all about the slug. Williams lifts and pulls the ball at high frequencies, allowing him to get the most from pedestrian strength markers. The downside here is that Williams swings and misses a lot (he had a 73.5% contact rate in Triple-A), meaning he's likely to strike out around a quarter of the time in the majors. He should provide enough of everything else -- power, walks, defense, and baserunning -- to enjoy a big-league career. It just won't be the one you'd expect at first blush.\"The 25-year-old Sproat is a right-hander who made four starts for the Mets last season. Across parts of two minor-league campaigns, the University of Florida product pitched to a 3.83 ERA and a 2.57 K/BB ratio in 48 starts and two relief appearances. During his brief stint in the majors in 2025, Sproat averaged 96 mph with his fastball. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Our NFL \"final four\" has been finalized, as conference championship weekend takes place this Sunday. Mike Vrabel has taken the New England Patriots from pretender to contender in his first season, while Sean Payton's Denver Broncos finally won their first playoff game since Super Bowl 50. However, they did lose their quarterback in the process. Over on the NFC side of things, we get another NFC West showdown this week, as Matthew Stafford and the Los Angeles Rams travel to Seattle to take on Sam Darnold and the Seahawks. When these two teams met last month, they gave us one of the games of the year, as Seattle converted a game-winning two-point conversion in overtime. What will happen this time around?Which teams should you pick this week, and which should you fade? CBS Sports writers Jordan Dajani and Jared Dubin are here to break them down. For clarity, lines for these selections were taken on Jan. 21 over at DraftKings Sportsbook. New England Patriots (-5.5) at Denver BroncosSunday, 3 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nDajani (Patriots -5.5): I'm not sure what kind of deal Mike Vrabel made with the football gods, but it's pretty incredible that New England got to play the easiest strength of schedule since the turn of the millennium, hosted a hapless Justin Herbert in the wild-card round, the turnover addict C.J. Stroud in the divisional round, and who is waiting for the Patriots in the AFC Championship game? JARRETT STIDHAM.Stidham is the seventh quarterback to make his first start of the season in the playoffs, and only one of the previous six actually won their game. He is 1-3 as an NFL starter, and it will be interesting to see how Sean Payton alters his game plan with Bo Nix out. Regardless of Stidham's role on Sunday, there are two things that must happen if the Broncos want this upset: The run game has to reappear and the defense has to dominate. Since J.K. Dobbins was injured in Week 10, the Broncos rank bottom 10 in rushing yards per game and yards per rush. Dobbins has a chance to return this week, but I'm not banking on him to be an X factor. This Denver defense ranks top three in points allowed per game (18.3), yards allowed per game (278.2) and third-down percentage (33.8%) as well. Vance Joseph's unit can definitely contain Drake Maye, but the Patriots are the only team with a perfect against-the-spread record (8-0) on the road this season. I believe this will be a close game until New England finally covers in the fourth quarter …  Prediction: Patriots 20, Broncos 13\nDubin (Patriots -5.5): This one is pretty simple: the Broncos will not have their starting quarterback for this game. It's really hard to see them putting together a representative offensive performance with Jarrett Stidham at the helm -- especially given how well the New England defense has played so far during the playoffs in holding down offenses piloted by Justin Herbert and C.J. Stroud. New England's offense hasn't exactly lit the world on fire in either of its games against elite defenses, and the Broncos present another one for them to go up against, but I have far more trust in Drake Maye going against a Denver unit that has actually shown some leaks since its bye week, than I do in Stidham and Co. against the Pats. … Prediction: Patriots 21, Broncos 10Los Angeles Rams at Seattle Seahawks (-2.5)Sunday, 6:30 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nDajani (Rams +2.5): My preseason Super Bowl pick was Ravens vs. Rams, and just because I was wrong about Baltimore does not mean I'm flaking on Los Angeles in this spot. Everyone is going to be on the Seahawks this week because of their incredible defense, but I will remind you that Matthew Stafford and Co. racked up 581 yards of total offense and 37 points in that overtime thriller in Seattle we witnessed last month. This pick comes down to me trusting Stafford and his fantastic cast of weapons more than Sam Darnold. The historical trends are in my favor as well. The Rams are 2-0 all-time vs. the Seahawks in the playoffs, and have won four straight NFC Championship game appearances.I know scoring points against this Seahawks defense will be tough. The only touchdowns they've allowed since Thanksgiving, not including the Rams matchup, are a Philip Rivers passing touchdown and a Bryce Young rushing touchdown. Still, I'm calling for the upset. Sean McVay is 5-2 against the spread and 4-3 straight up as an underdog in the playoffs  …  Prediction: Rams 24, Seahawks 23\nDubin (Rams +2.5): I picked the Rams to beat the Seahawks in the NFC title game in our pre-playoff predictions, so I am obviously rolling with the same pick here. L.A. won the first game between these two teams and should have won the second one, and would have if not for one of the craziest two-point conversions anyone has ever seen. The Seahawks have an elite defense and home-field advantage, but when two teams are as close in quality as these two are, I always like to roll with whichever team has the advantage at quarterback, the game's most important position. In this case, that's Matthew Stafford and the Rams. I like them to advance with a closely-contested win.  … Prediction: Rams 23, Seahawks 20\n            ",

    "body": "\n        This season's NFC Championship game features the most exciting division rivalry grudge match in recent memory with the fifth-seeded Los Angeles Rams traveling to face the top-seeded Seattle Seahawks on Sunday. With the Rams prevailing 21-19 at home in Week 11 and the Seahawks surviving 38-37 in overtime at home in Week 16, Sunday's NFC Championship game will be the first interdivisional playoff matchup in NFL history where both regular season meetings were decided by two or fewer points, according to CBS Sports Research. Los Angeles outscored Seattle by one point (58-57) and outgained them by a single yard (830-829) in the 2025 regular season. These two teams have basically played to a draw this season. This game is also a matchup of the NFL's No. 1 scoring defense, the Seahawks unit that allowed an NFL-best 17.2 points per game, versus the NFL's No. 1 scoring offense, the Rams' attack that averaged an NFL-best 30.5 points per game. So what or who will be the key to tilting the third and final matchup of the season between these two NFC heavyweights? Obviously 2025 first team All-Pro Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford and 2025 first team All-Pro Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua will play crucial roles as will the Seahawks' three 2025 second team All-Pro defenders: defensive tackle Leonard Williams, linebacker Ernest Jones and cornerback Devon Witherspoon. However, let's take a look at X-factors for each team beyond their respective top-ranked NFL units that will possess a critical impact in deciding which NFC West powerhouse will represent the NFC in Super Bowl LX. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Rams -- Defensive frontThe Los Angeles Rams have one of the best pass rushes in football: their 41.7% quarterback pressure rate is the fourth-best in the NFL in 2025, and their 47 sacks are tied for the seventh-best in the league this season. The unit had three players with at least seven sacks in 2025 between edge rusher Byron Young (12.0, tied for the eighth-most in the league), edge rusher Jared Verse (7.5, tied for 29th in the league) and edge rusher Kobie Turner (7.0 tied for the 35th-most in the league). Only the AFC's top-seeded Denver Broncos (four players) had more such players this season. That's why the Rams defensive front is difficult to game plan against because offenses can't slide their protection to a single player. Current Seattle Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold has found that out the hard way in the playoffs. Last year with the Minnesota Vikings, he absorbed an NFL playoff record nine sacks in a 27-9 wild card round defeat that served as his postseason debut. Darnold also struggled with ball security in both regular season matchups with the Rams as the Seahawks quarterback in 2025. He threw for a career-high four interceptions in a 21-19 road defeat against Los Angeles in Week 11, and he was pressured on a season-high 46.2% of his dropbacks while throwing two interceptions and being sacked a season-high four times in a 38-37 overtime home win against the Rams in Week 16. Darnold also threw for 270 yards and two touchdowns that day. \nAcross Darnold's last three games against defensive coordinator Chris Shula and his Rams defense, he committed at least one turnover -- on a sack or a strip-sack fumble -- when pressured by this Los Angeles Rams defensive front. That's why Los Angeles' defensive front is the Rams' X-factor this Sunday in Seattle with a trip to a Super Bowl LX on the line. Being able to generate consistent pressure and create more Darnold turnovers will be a massive key in a Rams victory should they emerge victorious. Darnold is also dealing with an oblique issue that clearly hampered his mobility in the Seahawks' divisional round win over the San Francisco 49ers, so the Rams getting home against Seattle's offensive line once again could have an even more outsized impact in the third and final matchup of the season between these NFC West rivals. Sam Darnold's last three games vs. Rams, span begins in 2024 wild card round with VikingsStatsCompletion pct64.4%Pass TD-Turnovers3-8Passer rating67.5Times sacked13** Includes nine sacks in 2024 wild card round loss with Vikings, tied for the most in a playoff game in NFL history\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Seahawks -- RB Kenneth Walker III and the offensive lineSeattle quarterback Sam Darnold led the 2025 regular season with 20 turnovers, and he is clearly being impacted by an oblique injury right now after watching him try to move around in the pocket in the NFC divisional round win against the San Francisco 49ers. That's why running back Kenneth Walker III's and the Seahawks offensive line's collective ability to get the run game going to take some literal and metaphorical pressure off of Darnold will be one of the biggest keys to a Seattle victory on Sunday.Defense (three takeaways, an interception and two fumble recoveries) and special teams (Rashid Shaheed's 95-yard game-opening kickoff return touchdown) played a huge role in the Seahawks operating in cruise control in their 41-6 divisional round win over the 49ers, but so did Walker and the offensive line. He exploded for 145 yards from scrimmage (119 rushing on 19 carries for a 6.1 yards per carry average and 29 receiving) and three rushing touchdowns in a winning effort. That effort put Walker in a club with 2005 NFL MVP running back Shaun Alexander as the only players in Seattle Seahawks history with at least three rushing touchdowns in a playoff game.  Darnold will likely need another repeat performance from Walker, especially with fellow Seattle running back Zach Charbonnet ruled out for the season with what appears to be a torn ACL. The Seahawks' ability to get Walker in a strong rhythm will certainly make the difference in their quarterback committing two or fewer turnovers or more than two turnovers against the Rams. In the Week 16 home win in which Darnold had just two interceptions, Walker registered 100 yards rushing on the dot on 11 carries for an eye-popping 9.1 yards per carry and a rushing touchdown, which came from 55 yards out. In Darnold's four-interception meltdown in Seattle's 21-19 Week 11 road loss against the Rams, Walker had under 70 yards rushing, 67, and a touchdown, from a yard out, on 16 carries for a 4.2 yards per carry average. Walker, who did so twice, and Atlanta Falcons 2025 first team All-Pro Bijan Robinson are the only running backs with 100-plus scrimmage yards and at least one rushing touchdown against the Rams this season. How Walker performs on Sunday will have an outsized impact on Darnold's ability to hold on to the football. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        In just two weeks, the NFL will hand out all its awards for the 2025 season at the league's annual \"NFL Honors\" show, which will take place on Feb. 5 in San Francisco. During the event, hosted by Jon Hamm, we'll find out who won each award, from MVP to Coach of the Year to both Rookie of the Year awards and more. The Associated Press handles the voting for each award and the AP released the finalists in each category on Thursday. One thing to keep in mind with these awards is that they're voted on at the end of the regular season, so how a player performs in the postseason has no impact on who wins each award. With that in mind, let's check out the finalists.  Most Valuable Player Rams QB Matthew Stafford Patriots QB Drake Maye Bills QB Josh Allen 49ers RB Christian McCaffrey Jaguars Trevor LawrenceThere are five names listed here, but this feels like a two-horse race between Stafford and Maye. Remember, voting for this award was done before the playoffs started, so if Stafford or Maye took their team to the Super Bowl, it wouldn't affect the award in any way. Coach of the YearBears coach Ben Johnson Jaguars coach Liam Coen Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan Patriots coach Mike VrabelThis feels like one of the most wide-open years ever in this category, but the big favorites here have to be Vrabel, Johnson and Macdonald, who all won their division. In New England, Vrabel took a team that lost 13 games the previous year and led it to a 14-3 record and an AFC East title. In Seattle, Macdonald took a Seahawks team that didn't make the playoffs in 2024 and led them to the No. 1 overall seed in the NFC. As for Johnson, he took a Bears team that finished 5-12 last season and led them to an NFC North title. Vrabel feels like the slight favorite, but it wouldn't be surprising if one of the other two guys won. \n Offensive Player of the Year Rams WR Puka NacuaFalcons RB Bijan Robinson49ers RB Christian McCaffreySeahawks WR Jaxon Smith-NjigbaPatriots QB Drake MayeBijan Robinson had an impressive year for the Falcons, but this feels like an award that will either go to Smith-Njigba or Nacua. Not only did Smith-Njigba lead the NFL in receiver yards with 1,793, but he also set the Seahawks' franchise record for most receiving yards in a season. It would be a minor surprise if JSN didn't take home the award.  Defensive Player of the Year Texans DE Will Anderson Jr.,Broncos LB Nik BonittoBrowns DE Myles GarrettLions DE Aidan HutchinsonPackers EDGE Micah ParsonsGarrett set the NFL record for most sacks in a single season this year with 23, so it would be an absolute stunner if he doesn't end up winning. If Garrett wins, it would mark the second time in three seasons he's won the award.  Offensive Rookie of the Year Giants QB Jaxson DartBuccaneers WR Emeka EgbukaPatriots RB TreVeyon HendersonPanthers WR Tetairoa McMillanSaints QB Tyler ShoughOver the past six years, this award has either gone to a quarterback (four times) or a receiver (two times) and that certainly feels like it will once again be the case this year. Shough finished 5-4 this year and actually won more games than Dart, who went 4-8 as a starter, so if the award goes to a QB, Shough certainly has a strong argument. However, neither guy played the entire season, and if the voters want to give this award to the player with the best overall season, that would probably be McMillan, who led all rookie receivers with 1,014 yards and seven TD catches. \n Defensive Rookie of the Year Giants LB Abdul CarterSeahawks S Nick EmmanworiFalcons DE James Pearce Jr.Browns LB Carson SchwesingerFalcons S Xavier WattsIf you need an idea of how bad the Browns' offense was this year, just consider this: Cleveland's defense might end up taking home the top two defensive awards. Not only is Garrett the heavy favorite for defensive player of the year, but Schwesinger is definitely the favorite in this category after a 2025 season in which he led all rookies in tackles (146) and tackles for loss (11). Schwesinger also had 2.5 sacks and two interceptions during a strong first year on the field.  Comeback Player of the Year Patriots WR Stefon DiggsLions DE Aidan HutchinsonJaguars QB Trevor Lawrence49ers RB Christian McCaffreyCowboys QB Dak PrescottThis feels like it's Christian McCaffrey's award to lose. After missing 13 games last year due to an Achilles injury, McCaffrey bounced back with a 2025 season that saw him rush for 1,202 yards while also adding 924 receiving yards. McCaffrey also tallied 17 total touchdowns.  Assistant Coach of the Year Eagles DC Vic FangioVikings DC Brian FloresBroncos DC Vance JosephSeahawks OC Klint KubiakPatriots OC Josh McDanielsThe Patriots and Seahawks scored the second-most and third-most points in the NFL this year, so it won't be surprising if his award goes to McDaniels or Kubiak. McDaniels turned Drake Maye into an MVP candidate while Kubiak kept the Seahawks from having a top 10 quarterback. \n            ",

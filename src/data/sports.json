Among other things, the winter in baseball means a steady supply of rumors regarding free agent signings, trades, and the like. Speaking of which, you can find Friday's roundup just below. Padres land KBO star Sung-Mun SongThe Padres have agreed to terms with infielder Sung-Mun Song out of Korea, Robert Murray of Fansided reports. The deal will pay Song roughly $13 million over three years, according to Francys Romero. Song, age 29, was posted for MLB teams in November. Across parts of nine seasons in KBO, Korea's top professional circuit, Song batted .283/.347/.431. Over the last two seasons, however, Song reached new heights at the plate, and in 2025 for the Kiwoom Heroes he batted .315/.387/.530 with 26 home runs and 25 stolen bases in 144 games. He's been a primary third baseman for his pro career, but he also has time spent at second base and first base. \nRoyals acquire Strahm from PhilliesThe Royals have acquired veteran lefty reliever Matt Strahm from the Phillies in exchange for right-hander Jonathan Bowlan. The Royals announced the deal on Friday. \nStrahm is 34 and under contract for 2026 on a $4.5 million club option. For his career, he's pitched to a 126 ERA+ and an FIP of 3.56 in 395 appearances spread over 10 MLB seasons. He's reached new heights over the last two years, as Strahm in 2024 and 2025 combined had a 2.30 ERA with 149 strikeouts in 125 innings. He earned an All-Star appearance in 2024.\nAs for Bowlan, the 29-year-old right-hander has an ERA+ of 97 and an FIP of 4.86 across 37 MLB games. The vast majority of those appearances came in 2025, when he had an ERA of 3.86 and a K/BB ratio of 2.71 in 44 ⅓ innings for the Royals. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Several 2025-26 college football bowl games in the books, but some bowl confidence pools remain open for entries or modifications as there are more than 30 matchups remaining to make college football bowl picks on this season. Oklahoma (-1.5) vs. Alabama in the CFP on Friday is projected to be one of the tightest games in the postseason The two biggest spreads, meanwhile, are in the CFP first round on Saturday as Oregon is favored by 20.5 points over James Madison, while Ole Miss is a 17.5-point favorite over Tulane. While putting faith in big favorites is a part of just about everyone's college football bowl confidence strategy, correctly predicting a couple upsets can give you a big edge in any football pools. Anticipated matchups outside of the CFP include Penn State vs. Clemson (-3.5), Vanderbilt (-5.5) vs. Iowa, Georgia Tech vs. BYU (-4.5), Tennessee vs. Illinois (+2.5) and Michigan vs. Texas (-7.5).

USC went 9-3 in the regular season, with all three defeats coming versus ranked teams. TCU found itself in the Top 25 once -- back in September -- before having a pedestrian run through the Big 12 schedule, finishing 5-4. Even with the Horned Frogs playing in the easier conference than the Trojans, USC both averaged more points and allowed fewer points per game. USC sports a 32-9 (78%) straight-up record when favored since Lincoln Riley came aboard in 2022, as it is projected to easily take care of business in San Antonio. SportsLine's model has the Trojans prevailing 70% of the time. See all of the model's college football bowl confidence picks here.Another one of the bowl confidence predictions the model is high on: Northwestern (-10.5) handles Central Michigan in the GameAbove Sports Bowl on Dec. 26. Central Michigan struggled mightily against Power 4 opponents this year, losing 63-3 to Michigan and 45-17 to Pittsburgh. Northwestern went just 6-6 this year, but that was largely thanks to a very tough Big Ten schedule that included Oregon, Michigan, USC and Illinois. For comparison, Northwestern lost to Michigan by two points on a last-second field goal. The model has Northwestern winning nearly 80% of the time, making the Wildcats the clear side to back. See the rest of the college football bowl confidence predictions here. How to make college football bowl confidence picksThe model has also made the call on who wins every other bowl game. There are 11 teams that win at least 70% of the time, so you need to go big on those matchups, as well as 15 underdogs that win outright. You can get all the model's picks at SportsLine.So who wins every college football bowl game, and which matchups should you assign the most confidence points to?

Additionally, Philadelphia has owned this rivalry since Jalen Hurts entered the picture, as the team is 6-1 versus Washington in games Hurts starts and finishes, with the QB having 16 total touchdowns versus two interceptions. The Eagles' defense is also coming off its best performance in shutting out Vegas, and now it gets to face a Commanders team onto its backup quarterback, and one which doesn't have a defense to make up for Daniels' absence. Washington is No. 31 in total defense, with additional bottom-five rankings versus the run, versus the pass and in the red zone. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Commanders can coverWashington is coming off scoring its second-most points (29) of the season on Sunday, and it still has a potent rushing attack even without Daniels. The Commanders boast the No. 4 rushing offense, averaging 141.8 yards over their last four games, and stopping the ground game is an issue for the Eagles. They are No. 22 in stopping the run, having allowed 165.3 yards over their last three games, and Philly can also be sloppy with the ball, having committed nine turnovers over their last four games. Also, Washington has covered in two of its last three games overall, while Philly is just 1-3 ATS in divisional games this year. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Eagles vs. Commanders picksSportsLine's model has simulated Commanders vs. Eagles 10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 48 combined points. It also says one side of the spread hits in well over 50% of simulations.

    "body": "\n        The Los Angeles Rams and Seattle Seahawks entered \"Thursday Night Football\" in Week 16 with identical 11-3 records, as both the NFC West crown and the No. 1 seed in the NFC were on the line.Despite the Rams leading 30-14 with under nine minutes to play, the Seahawks rallied to tie the game with two touchdowns and two two-point conversions before converting a third two-point attempt to win 38-37 in overtime.How rare was it for the Seahawks to erase a 16-point deficit in the fourth quarter? Prior to Thursday, Seattle was 0-172 when trailing by at least 15 points in the final frame. Thursday's victory marked the largest fourth-quarter comeback in Seahawks franchise history, per CBS Sports Research.What other wild events could occur during a Week 16 NFL weekend full of playoff stakes? Let's take a look with five bold predictions.\nJaguars hand Broncos first loss of the season at Mile HighThe Denver Broncos (12-2) enter the weekend as the AFC's No. 1 seed, riding an 11-game winning streak and a 12-game home winning streak at Mile High dating back to 2024. Denver is the NFL's lone unbeaten home team this season and boasts the league's top pass rush with 58 sacks -- the most through 13 games since the 2000 Saints -- putting the Broncos on pace for 70 sacks, just two shy of the NFL single-season record set by the 1984 Bears.That run, however, will end this week. The Jacksonville Jaguars (10-4) arrive in Denver on a five-game winning streak, led by quarterback Trevor Lawrence, who tops the NFL in both yards per attempt (8.6) and passing touchdowns (13) during that span. Lawrence, along with running back Travis Etienne (career-high 12 scrimmage touchdowns) and wide receiver Jakobi Meyers (255 yards and three touchdowns on 27 catches in six games with Jacksonville), will do just enough to overcome Denver's dominant defense in a shocking road upset at Mile High.\nPackers intercept Caleb Williams twice despite Micah Parsons' absenceGreen Bay has been a top-10 defense all season in nearly every key metric, largely due to the impact of All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons. While the Packers' pass rush won't be as ferocious with Parsons sidelined by a torn ACL, that's something Chicago Bears quarterback Caleb Williams is sure to appreciate in the Week 16 rivalry rematch.\nWilliams won't be as frantic as he was in Green Bay's 28-21 win in Week 14, when Parsons generated seven pressures -- tied for the most by any defender in a game against Chicago this season. That should help a quarterback as efficient as Williams, who owns the second-best touchdown-to-interception ratio (41-12, 3.42) in NFL history since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger among quarterbacks with at least 1,000 career pass attempts, trailing only Aaron Rodgers (525-123, 4.27).Even so, the Packers will pick off Williams twice on Saturday night. Parsons' absence will force defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley to get more creative with his blitz packages, leading to linebacker Edgerrin Cooper crashing the pocket more frequently. That added pressure will coerce Williams into multiple errant throws, resulting in two interceptions in Week 16.\nJosh Allen avoids sack from Myles Garrett, delays historyCleveland Browns All-Pro edge rusher Myles Garrett is on the doorstep of NFL history. His 21.5 sacks lead the league by a staggering 8.5, and he sits just one sack shy of tying the single-season record shared by Michael Strahan (2001) and T.J. Watt (2021).\nStanding in Garrett's way in Week 16 is 2024 NFL MVP Josh Allen. While Allen owns the 10th-highest sack rate (7.5%) among qualified quarterbacks, that number is heavily skewed by Buffalo's Week 12 loss in Houston, when he was sacked eight times by the Texans' Pro Bowl edge duo of Will Anderson Jr. (2.5 sacks) and Danielle Hunter (2.0). Since then, Buffalo's Superman has heated up, coming off back-to-back games with at least three passing touchdowns and no interceptions for the first time in his eight-year career.Allen will escape Garrett's clutches, forcing the Browns star to wait until Week 17 to make history.\n        \n            \n                2025 NFL playoff picture: Seahawks beat Rams in a stunner that blows open the NFC race heading into Week 16\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDak Prescott throws for 300 yards, no picks vs. ChargersThe Los Angeles Chargers are one of the hottest teams in football, largely because of their defense. Los Angeles has won six of its last seven games while leading the NFL in total defense (242.3 yards allowed per game). Takeaways have been a major factor as well, with 17 interceptions this season -- including a league-best 11 since Week 8.\nEven so, Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott will throw for over 300 yards without a turnover Sunday at AT&T Stadium. Prescott leads the NFL in passing yards (3,931) despite playing behind a young, injury-riddled offensive line. Left tackle Tyler Guyton (ankle) is set to miss his fourth straight game, while right tackle Terence Steele has allowed an NFL-high 40 quarterback pressures in 2025, per TruMedia.Prescott will overcome both the protection issues and the Chargers' locked-in defense to deliver the kind of performance Cowboys fans -- and fantasy managers -- are hoping for in Week 16.\nPhilip Rivers throws for 300 yards at age 44Philip Rivers nearly led the Indianapolis Colts to a win in an 18-16 loss at Seattle in his first start in 1,800 days, an accomplishment in itself. Still, the performance was uneven: Rivers threw for just 120 yards with one touchdown and one interception, completing only two of eight throws of 10-plus air yards. He finished 1-for-5 for two yards when pressured and relied heavily on short throws behind the line of scrimmage.\nDespite those limitations, Rivers will throw for over 300 yards against the 10-4 San Francisco 49ers. San Francisco has just 15 sacks this season -- the fewest through 14 games since 1982 -- largely due to Nick Bosa's season-ending ACL tear in Week 3. Since Week 4, the 49ers rank last in quarterback pressure rate (27.6%).Rivers will take advantage of the lack of pressure, even at 44 years old, and post a 300-yard passing day against one of the NFC's top teams.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Liverpool will try to keep up their recent form when they visit North London on Saturday to take on a struggling Tottenham side. Liverpool (8-2-6) are seventh in the English Premier League table but just two points behind fourth-place Chelsea, while Spurs (6-4-6) are 11th and have struggled mightily at home. They have lost 10 games on their home ground in 2025, and a loss would be a team record for a calendar year.

The team hit one of its roughest runs of matches in recent history, and the problems both on and off the pitch were mounting. They seem to have stabilized a bit moving into December. The tension between Arne Slot and Mo Salah seems to be mostly squashed, and the team is coming in off a few positive results. The club managed to beat Inter in UCL play on the road and beat Brighton 2-0 in their last EPL matchday. While this doesn't seem necessarily shocking considering Liverpool's usual pedigree, the victories were much-needed and could be a turning point for Liverpool as they look for a third straight win. Players like Hugo Ekitike and Dominik Szoboszlai are stepping up in a big way, and the attack for the Reds should be on display against a Spurs side that just got run over by Nottingham.Bet Tottenham vs. Liverpool at BetMGM Sportsbook, where new users get up to $1,500 in bonus bets back if their first wager doesn't win with the promo code CBSSPORTS:Goals galore in this head-to-headThere is no other Premier League fixture with as many goals as when Liverpool and Spurs go at it. Both teams have scored in 10 consecutive Premier League matches between the teams. They played twice last season in EPL play, and those games saw a combined 15 goals, with Liverpool winning 6-3 and 4-2. This is a matchup where Liverpool know how to produce goals. Even with this team struggling to find consistency, this is the perfect match to find their goal-scoring boots. The Spurs defense has been fragile, and their matches have been riddled with goals. I expect both teams to come out swinging and make it another goal-fest at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\n            ",

The Patriots (11-3) can tighten their grip on the top of the AFC East on \"Sunday Night Football\" against the Ravens (7-7) -- a game the Ravens desperately need to keep pace with the AFC North-leading Steelers. After a pivotal \"Thursday Night Football\" showdown between the Rams and Seahawks reshaped the NFC West -- and the conference race as a whole -- now is the perfect time to take a live look at the playoff picture. Below, we break down who's in and who's out.\nAFC standingsx-Denver Broncos (12-2)New England Patriots (11-3)Jacksonville Jaguars (10-4)Pittsburgh Steelers (8-6)Los Angeles Chargers (10-4)Buffalo Bills (10-4)Houston Texans (9-5)x-clinched playoff berth\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Denver Broncos (12-2)Remaining schedule: vs. Jaguars, at Chiefs, vs. ChargersAfter winning their 11th straight game thanks to a 34-26 victory against the Green Bay Packers, the Broncos are 12-2 and have officially clinched a playoff berth. They have a solid cushion in the AFC West, and now have even more breathing room in their pursuit of the No. 1 seed thanks to Buffalo defeating the Patriots. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. New England Patriots (11-3)Remaining schedule: at Ravens, at Jets, vs. DolphinsThe Patriots had an opportunity to clinch the AFC East with a win over Buffalo on Sunday, but blew a 21-point lead in Week 15 to snap their winning streak. New England remains in first place in the division, but the Bills are lurking. Beyond Buffalo, that loss also doesn't help the Patriots in their pursuit of Denver for the No. 1 seed.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Jacksonville Jaguars (10-4)Remaining schedule: at Broncos, at Colts, vs. TitansThe Jaguars have now won five straight games following a blowout victory against the New York Jets. That helps keep them in first place in the AFC South over the surging Houston Texans.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Pittsburgh Steelers (8-6)Remaining schedule: at Lions, at Browns, vs. RavensThe Steelers remain in sole possession of first place in the AFC North after defeating the Dolphins on \"Monday Night Football,\" but there's still a lot to be determined in this division. It could come down to their Week 18 matchup in Pittsburgh.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Los Angeles Chargers (10-4)Remaining schedule: at Cowboys, vs. Texans, at BroncosThe Chargers notched their 10th win of the season and eliminated the Kansas City Chiefs from playoff contention on Sunday with a nail-biting win at Arrowhead. That victory not only keeps them as the No. 1 wild card team, but they are still within range of Denver in the AFC West. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Buffalo Bills (10-4)Remaining schedule: at Browns, vs. Eagles, vs. JetsIt cannot be overstated how important Buffalo's comeback win over the Patriots was in Week 15. After erasing another double-digit deficit, the Bills are still alive in the AFC East race, meaning there is still a path to a higher seed and a home playoff game.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Houston Texans (9-5)Remaining schedule: vs. Raiders, at Chargers, vs. ColtsAfter starting the year 0-3, the Texans have clawed back into the playoff picture as the No. 7 seed and are coming off an impressive win over the Cardinals at home in Week 15. They've now won six straight and are on the heels of the Jaguars in the AFC South, so there is room for this climb to go even higher.In the huntThe Colts (8-6) are mathematically still in the hunt, but have a difficult road forward, especially after being unable to pull off the upset in Seattle in Week 15. \nThe team that may have the best chance of this group to make the postseason is the Ravens (7-7), especially after shutting out the Bengals to move back to .500 on the year. That keeps them one game behind the Steelers in the AFC North with one more head-to-head still to go in the regular-season finale.NFC standingsx-Seattle Seahawks (12-3)Chicago Bears (10-4)Philadelphia Eagles (9-5)Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-7)x-Los Angeles Rams (11-4)San Francisco 49ers (10-4)Green Bay Packers (9-4-1)x-clinched playoff berth  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Seattle Seahawks (12-3)Remaining schedule: at Panthers, at 49ersSeattle pulled off an incredible, come-from-behind win over the Rams on \"Thursday Night Football,\" elevating itself to the No. 1 seed in the conference in the process. If the Seahawks win out against the Panthers and Niners, they will clinch the top spot in the NFC and a bye in the first round of the playoffs. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. Chicago Bears (10-4)Remaining schedule: vs. Packers, at 49ers, vs. LionsThe Bears have notched double-digit wins on the season after soundly taking down the Cleveland Browns at Soldier Field. Thanks to the Denver Broncos defeating the Packers, Chicago has vaulted back up to first place in the NFC North and are currently the No. 2 seed in the conference. Of course, this puts even more emphasis on what was already a massive matchup with Green Bay on Saturday night. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Philadelphia Eagles (9-5)Remaining schedule: at Commanders, at Bills, vs. CommandersPhiladelphia snapped a three-game losing streak on Sunday with a blowout win against the Raiders. Jalen Hurts bounced back nicely with three passing touchdowns, and the victory helps the Eagles hold firm atop the NFC East. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-7)Remaining schedule: at Panthers, at Dolphins, vs. PanthersEven after that demoralizing loss to the Falcons on Thursday, the Buccaneers come out of Week 15 in first place in the NFC South. That's thanks to the New Orleans Saints upsetting the Carolina Panthers to push them to 7-7 on the season. Tampa Bay holds the tiebreaker over Carolina at the moment due to a better win percentage against common opponents. However, both head-to-head matchups are still on deck, which will kick off on Sunday in Carolina. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Los Angeles Rams (11-4)Remaining schedule: at Falcons, vs. CardinalsThe Rams are still a playoff lock thanks to their win in Week 15, but their chances of winning the NFC West and claiming the No. 1 seed in the conference were dramatically reduced by their loss to the Seahawks on Thursday night. They need Seattle to lose at least one more game, but also can't have the 49ers win out. Otherwise, San Francisco would be the top seed in the conference by virtue of having the best division record among the three teams. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. San Francisco 49ers (10-4)Remaining schedule: at Colts, vs. Bears, vs. SeahawksThe Niners are quietly lurking in the NFC playoff race. Despite being the No. 6 seed, San Francisco is 10-4 and ready to pounce if their division rivals slip up down the stretch. The team split the head-to-head series with the Rams, but does currently have the advantage over Seattle, which the 49ers face again in Week 18. Following L.A.'s loss to Seattle on Thursday night, the Niners control their own destiny in the race for the No. 1 seed in the conference. If they win out, they get the top spot.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Green Bay Packers (9-4-1)Remaining schedule: at Bears, vs. Ravens, at VikingsGreen Bay saw a considerable fall from grace. After coming into Week 15 as the No. 2 seed and in first place in the NFC North, they've suddenly dropped all the way to the No. 7 seed after falling to the Denver Broncos. That defeat helped Chicago move on top of the Packers for first place in the division, which puts an even greater emphasis on Saturday's matchup. Even worse, pass rusher Micah Parsons left Sunday's loss due to a torn ACL. \nBecause Green Bay swept the season series against the Lions, the Packers have some wiggle room to play with before falling out of the playoff picture entirely. In the huntThe Lions (8-6) have their backs against the wall a bit after falling to the Los Angeles Rams in Week 15. That defeat continues to keep them on the outside looking in on the playoff picture as the No. 8 seed as they are in third place in the NFC North. They aren't out of the race quite yet, but they certainly need to win out and get some help along the way. The Carolina Panthers (7-7) had a golden opportunity to create some space between them and the Buccaneers for first place in the NFC South, simply needing a win over the Saints to move to 8-6, while Tampa Bay stumbled to 7-7 with a loss to Atlanta on Thursday. However, the Panthers allowed New Orleans to pull off the upset in Week 15, which sent them back to .500 on the season. Because they're knotted with the Bucs, they lose the tiebreaker due to an inferior record against common opponents. Of course, the Panthers can get back into it with two of their remaining three games on the season against Tampa.  \nThe Cowboys (6-7-1) are on life support after losing to the Vikings on Sunday night, all but ending any hopes of securing a postseason berth. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        James Madison is set to enter its first College Football Playoff on Saturday as the 12-seed Dukes travel to play 5-seed Oregon at Autzen Stadium. The Dukes reached the playoff after winning the Sun Belt in only their second year of eligibility and outflanking ACC champ Duke in the final rankings. The Dukes are now set to enter the 2025 College Football Playoff only four years after they transitioned from the FCS level. James Madison is a two-time national champion in FCS with five top-three finishes in its final six years before moving to the Sun Belt. Now, James Madison is one of two Group of Five teams to participate in the CFP, the first time in history there have been two such teams. Here's what you need to know about James Madison, including location, history and notable players. Where is James Madison located?James Madison University is located in Harrisonburg, Virginia, which is located near the Virginia/West Virginia border. JMU was founded in 1908 as \"The State Normal and Industrial School for Women.\" It was named after the fourth president in 1938, largely due to its proximity to his historic Montpelier Estate in Orange, Virginia. \nJames Madison's football historyThe Dukes started playing football in 1972, but did not formally join a Division I conference until joining the Yankee Conference (a predecessor to the Colonial Athletic Conference) in 1992. In 2004, legendary coach Mickey Matthews stunned the FCS and led James Madison to the national championship. From there, James Madison became a serious national power at the FCS level, only trailing the Dakota schools in success. They became a mainstay in the FCS Playoffs, ultimately winning another championship under Mike Houston in 2016. The program ultimately decided to join the FBS in 2022. By reaching the College Football Playoff only three years later, James Madison has cemented itself as having the most successful transition in college football history. \nCurt Cignetti's connectionIn 2019, James Madison hired up-and-coming coach Curt Cignetti to lead the program. Cignetti spent time as recruiting coordinator on Nick Saban's first staff at Alabama, but later rose from IUP to Elon before landing at James Madison. While Cignetti never won a national title, he led one of the most important moments in the history of the program. During his time in FCS, Cignetti went 33-5 with three straight top-3 finishes. In 2022, the Dukes transitioned to FBS as members of the Sun Belt. The program immediately became a conference title contender, even as they remained ineligible for the postseason. In 2023, James Madison even appealed to try and become eligible for the postseason as they rattled off a 11-1 season, but ultimately gave it up. In addition to Cignetti, offensive coordinator Mike Shanahan and defensive coordinator Bryant Haines both came through James Madison as well. The vast majority of Indiana's best players started with the Dukes, including cornerback D'Angelo Ponds, defensive lineman Mikail Kamara, linebacker Aidan Fisher and receiver Elijah Surratt. \nWho is JMU coach Bob Chesney? James Madison hired Bob Chesney to replace Cignetti in 2024. Similar to Cignetti, Chesney had a significant rise through the non-FBS ranks. His first head coaching job came in 2010 at Division III Salve Regina. Chesney also stopped through Division II Assumption and FCS Holy Cross before landing at JMU. Chesney has a 132-51 career record, including 21-5 at James Madison in two years. Since 2015, he has eight appearances in the national tournament in 11 years across FBS, FCS and Division II. Chesney is set to become the next coach at UCLA when his season ends. Tulane coach Jon Sumrall finds himself in a similar position as Sumrall prepares to join Florida while also planning for the College Football Playoff. \nJames Madison's notable backup QBAs Alonza Barnett III dealt with injuries over the offseason, Chesney brought high-profile quarterback Matthew Sluka in as a backup. Sluka made headlines last season after he left UNLV following an undefeated start amid an NIL dispute. He redshirted to maintain his eligibility. Chesney coached Sluka at Holy Cross as he ultimately earned All-America honors and finished fourth in voting for the Walter Payton Award. As a junior, Sluka posted 1,728 yards passing, 1,247 yards rushing and 29 total touchdowns for the Crusaders. Who will coach James Madison in 2026? Former Florida coach Billy Napier has been named the next head coach at James Madison after Chesney's playoff run is complete. Napier struggled at Florida, but went 40-12 in four seasons as a Sun Belt coach at Louisiana, including consecutive conference championships. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Zion Williamson is nearing the end of his time with the New Orleans Pelicans. It may come through a trade. It may come through his non-guaranteed contract, which only guarantees through games played triggers the Pelicans can choose to bypass just by sitting him. But one way or another, it just no longer makes sense for Williamson to stay in New Orleans. The Pelicans can't justify a $40 million salary for someone who's rarely available, especially when his place in that team's future has seemingly been supplanted by a recent draft pick (Derik Queen). When presented the option between taking less money with the Pelicans and taking less money with another team, well, most players are going to choose the other team. If you're not going to make a max salary anymore, you might as well take that pay cut for a winner, or for a team you trust to take better care of your health than the Pelicans have.That makes the rest of this season, or at least the period leading up to the trade deadline, a bit awkward. Williamson is a high-maintenance player. He needs the ball to thrive. The Pelicans would rather keep the ball in the hands of their younger players. Lineups need to be built to suit his needs. The Pelicans weren't great at doing that even at the best of times. This could have gotten ugly. Instead, something mutually beneficial seems to be happening.On Dec. 14 against the Bulls, the Pelicans brought Williamson off the bench for the first time in his career. He scored 18 points across almost 27 minutes in a win. On Thursday, the Pelicans again started without Williamson. He wasn't nearly as effective, but the Pelicans won the game in overtime against the contending Rockets. Williamson has come off of the bench twice for New Orleans and the Pelicans have won both games. He's started 10 games and they've lost nine of them.\nThe stated purpose of using Williamson, who has returned after missing more than two weeks with a hip injury, as a reserve is to make better use of the minutes he can play under his current minutes limit. \"If you bring him off the bench, it lays out cleaner to finish in the fourth quarter in a more manageable way. You're not rushing to bring him back in or take him out. It gets clunky in the fourth if he's starting right out of the gate,\" Pelicans coach James Borrego said, before adding that the hope is for Williamson to eventually get back to his \"normal rotation.\"However, so far at least, this new arrangement is working out well for everyone. New Orleans, without control over its first-round pick, has no incentive to lose games, so this newfound winning is an obvious benefit. It also makes it easier for them to separate Williamson's minutes from Queen's, as the two overlap quite a bit. Williamson was better in the Bulls game. Queen, who was a +18 while Williamson was a -17, was better against Houston. But perhaps most importantly, it shows that Williamson is flexible about his role, something that should appeal to potential future employers.\"If you're about team and you're about winning, you're willing to make moves like that. If guys are willing to sacrifice, that's a positive for our culture and our team,\" Borrego said. The next team Williamson plays for is not going to be built specifically to suit him. Doing so given his medical history would be irresponsible. That's going to mean that some degree of sacrifice is probably required. There's a big difference between joining a team as a No. 1 overall pick perceived as a franchise player and doing so as a buy-low free-agent signing or trade addition.\nSo if Williamson's next stop is any sort of \"prove it\" destination, proving ahead of time that he's comfortable in a smaller role obviously gives him a bit of a head start. There's a pretty rich history of high-profile players thriving in smaller bench roles when it becomes clear that their bodies can't handle the strain of a starter's workload. Bill Walton won Sixth Man of the Year and a championship averaging only 19 minutes or so per game for the 1985-86 Boston Celtics. Blake Griffin was a very effective role player for the Nets after his body broke down in Detroit. Though he was never quite as high profile, Shaun Livingston was at one time a potential future star who had to reinvent himself in a smaller role for the Warriors and wound up becoming a key part of a dynasty.These are possible models for Williamson, but there are just as many in the NBA today if you're willing to broaden your search a bit. The league has frankly never been kinder to players who can be extremely productive in mostly short stints. Think about how critical T.J. McConnell was for the Pacers during their run to the Finals last year. How many minutes do you think he averaged in doing so? He must've played at least half of the game, right? No? Maybe 20 minutes then? Wrong again. McConnell averaged 17.5 minutes in the 2025 postseason. But he owned every one of them, generating huge value in brief stints. Steven Adams is doing the same thing for Houston. Jose Alvarado has made a career out of this. When a reserve has a single, star-level trait, whether it's McConnell's mid-range shot-making or Adams' offensive rebounding, they can tilt entire stretches of games even if they're flawed in other ways, especially if those stretches are coming against weaker bench lineups.That's probably Williamson's best bet at maximizing his own future. It just doesn't seem realistic to ask him to play 30 minutes every night anymore, but if he can get to a winning team that wants him to play 20, and completely own those minutes by getting to the rim at will against weaker bench lineups, there's still a chance for him to be a hugely impactful supporting piece that can scale up in playing time and usage when circumstances demand it. That is frankly probably the sort of role he's going to be paid for in his next job. And the early impression he's giving for now that is that he'd be on board with that. And when he gets to pick the team he's doing it for, then all the better.\nWe'll see how long this experiment in New Orleans lasts. Perhaps as he gets healthier, Williamson pushes for his starting job back--though with Queen and Saddiq Bey playing as well as they are, it's unclear who the Pelicans could even bench. Or maybe he gets hurt again, or the team's newfound success proves to be a mirage. For now, though, this is working for everyone. The Pelicans are slowly turning the page on the Williamson era, and Williamson himself is making use of its ending to set himself up for what's probably coming next.\n            ",

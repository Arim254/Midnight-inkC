Not anymore. The Commanders will be shy their three primary WRs with Deebo Samuels ruled out Saturday. In a contrasting development with Dallas, WR CeeDee Lamb, who exceeded 100 receiving yards in his first two games before an injury in Week 3, resurfaces,\" SportsLine NFL expert Mike Tierney said. \"The beneficiary is QB Dak Prescott, who doesn't need much help in this rivalry. With Dak under center, the Pokes are perfect SU in six visits by the Commanders and 11-2 overall. His stat line in home games is dazzling: 17 TD throws, no picks. Dallas must compensate for a freak injury to CB Stephon Diggs, but the guests' WR dire situation softens the blow.\" Back the Cowboys at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Under 47.5 points in 49ers vs. Falcons\"The early line last week for the Week 7 game between the Falcons at the 49ers had the home team -4.5, which dropped to -3.5 on Sunday before the 49ers lost at Tampa Bay, which dropped to -3 after the loss and -2.5 following the Falcons Monday night win over the Bills.

    "body": "\n        Two AFC teams battling to get out of a 1-5 hole face off in NFL Week 7 as the Cleveland Browns host the Miami Dolphins on Paramount+. Miami suffered another close loss in Week 6, falling at home 29-27 to the Los Angeles Chargers. Meanwhile, the Browns continued to struggle generating offense in a 23-9 Week 6 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers. Kickoff from Huntington Bank Field is set for 1 p.m. ET on CBS and Paramount+. Cleveland is a 2.5-point favorite in the latest Dolphins vs. Browns odds from SportsLine consensus, while the over/under for total points scored is 34.5.

Tua Tagovailoa threw three interceptions in that game and will now face one of the toughest defenses in the league. The Dolphins' offensive line has been porous and the defense has allowed 389.3 total yards per game, which could leave room for Dillon Gabriel to have his best NFL career start.  Gabriel only completed 29-of-52 passes and was held without a touchdown against Pittsburgh, but also threw for 221 yards and avoided throwing any picks. Fellow rookie Quinshon Judkins was held out of the endzone in Week 6 but could have a rebound game against Miami's league-worst run defense. The Browns are holding opposing offenses to 79.7 rushing yards per game, which will make it difficult for De'Von Achane to get the ball downfield.Click here to bet Dolphins vs. Browns at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if their first bet of at least $5 wins:Model's Dolphins vs. Browns score prediction, picksThe Browns are 2-4-0 ATS this season and haven't covered the spread since Week 3.

He leads the league in rushing yards (603), yards per game (100.5) and touchdowns (7), so he is expected to keep the Chargers run defense -- which allows 124.2 rushing yards per game -- quite busy. Daniel Jones continues to be solid under center for the Colts despite throwing an interception against Arizona, but he won't be able to afford any mistakes against the Chargers defense.  The Los Angeles defense clearly misses Khalil Mack, as it is allowing 301.7 total yards and 20.8 points per game and coming off of a sloppy road appearance against a dysfunctional Dolphins team. The offense has picked up some of the slack, and Herbert has thrown at least one touchdown pass in every game this season.

    "body": "\nWith just days until the start of the NBA regular season, Fantasy basketball 2025 drafts are popping up left and right. One name which has been one of the first Fantasy basketball picks for over two decades now is LeBron James, but a nerve injury will keep him off the court until possibly November. That means more of the Lakers' offense will fall on the shoulders of Luka Doncic, but is that enough to allow the former Mav to top the 2025 Fantasy basketball rankings?Doncic has competition with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Nikola Jokic for the top spot. You can't really go wrong with selecting any of them, however, you may need some Fantasy basketball 2025 advice when it comes to the later rounds of your drafts. Before making any 2025-26 Fantasy basketball picks, be sure to check out the 2025 Fantasy basketball rankings and cheat sheets from the proven computer model at SportsLine.LIMITED TIME: Use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1 JOIN NOW. SportsLine's proven model simulates each season 10,0000 times. This model is powered by the same people who powered projections for all three major Fantasy sites. These cheat sheets and rankings, available for leagues on many major sites, are updated multiple times every day. Last year the model called a breakout season for Stephon Castle, predicting that he would finish 25 spots ahead of consensus ADP at his position. The result: Castle won NBA Rookie of the year honors after averaging 14.7 points, 4.1 assists and 3.7 rebounds per game and finished as the No. 51 guard in average Fantasy points per game. The model also nailed James Harden as a sleeper last year before he put together his first All-Star season in three years and called Paolo Banchero's and Victor Wembanyama's breakout seasons before they went on to win NBA Rookie of the Year honors as well.Now, SportsLine has simulated the entire NBA season 10,000 times and released its latest Fantasy basketball rankings 2025-26, along with plenty of sleepers, breakouts and busts. Head to SportsLine now to see these 2025-26 Fantasy basketball rankings.   Top 2025 Fantasy basketball sleepers  One of the top 2025 Fantasy basketball sleepers the model is predicting: Bucks guard Kevin Porter Jr. A trade deadline acquisition by Milwaukee last year, Porter posted per-36 minute averages of 21.2 points, 7.1 rebounds and 6.7 assists with the Bucks. That's on par with what the likes of Scottie Barnes and Desmond Bane averaged last year on the same per-36 minute basis. While Barnes and Bane are both top-50 draft picks, per 2025 Fantasy basketball ADP, Porter is a steal who's going outside the top 70.He could certainly push for 36 minutes per night with Milwaukee ridding itself of Damian Lillard, who averaged 36.1 minutes in 2024-25. Outside of Porter and Giannis Antetokounmpo, the Bucks don't have a single player on their roster who averaged even 3.0 assists last year, so Porter's playmaking will certainly be needed. It was in the 2022-23 season that Porter averaged 19.2 points, 5.7 assists and 5.3 rebounds with Houston, and it's not outside the realm of possibilities to see him matching those numbers this season. See more Fantasy basketball sleepers 2025 here. Top 2025 Fantasy basketball breakouts  One of the 2025 Fantasy basketball breakouts the model has identified: Jazz point guard Isaiah Collier, who has an ADP of No. 137 overall. The former No. 1 overall recruit was the penultimate pick in the first round of last year's draft and began his rookie year as a reserve. He quickly ascended to the starting point guard position and upped his scoring average over each of the last four months of the season. He also averaged 6.3 assists for the season, which was 16th in the NBA as he was the only first-year player to rank in the top 50 in assists.Coming off a franchise-worst 65-loss season, Utah is clearly in its rebuilding phase, and Collier is one of the cornerstones of that effort. Thus, he will be given lots of court time to establish himself as, potentially, Utah's point guard of both the present and the future. Add in that he plays for a Jazz team which loves to get up and down the court -- ranking fifth in pace last year -- and Collier is poised to pile up stats and make a name for himself this season. Identify other Fantasy basketball breakouts 2025 here. Top 2025 Fantasy basketball busts As for players to avoid, the model lists Pelicans guard Jordan Poole as a Fantasy basketball bust. Poole was acquired by the New Orleans Pelicans from the Washington Wizards during the offseason. Despite his somewhat lofty numbers, he finds himself in a situation where he needs to be a complementary piece to Zion Williamson. He also may have to take a lesser role behind New Orleans' two lottery picks in Derik Queen and Jeremiah Fears. If they emerge in their rookie seasons, Poole could definitely see his production go down.Poole is being picked in the seventh round, according to the latest ADP, but he may not be worth taking. In fact, SportsLine's model has players such as Jrue Holiday and Immanuel Quickly, both of whom are projected by many to be picked later, as better values. Avoid these 2025 Fantasy basketball busts as well. How to find proven 2025-26 Fantasy basketball rankings SportsLine is also extremely high on a surprising forward you aren't even thinking about being taken in the early rounds of 2025 Fantasy basketball drafts. This player is a top-3 Fantasy option at his position and is ranked ahead of stars like Kevin Durant and Paolo Banchero. You can only see who it is, and the 2025 Fantasy basketball rankings for every player, at SportsLine.So which 2025-26 Fantasy basketball sleepers, breakouts and busts should you target and fade, and which forward shocks the NBA as a top-3 player in positional rankings? Visit SportsLine now to get 2025-26 Fantasy basketball cheat sheets for every single position, all from the model that's nailed its Fantasy basketball picks, and find out.\n            ",

The Raiders offense ranks 23rd in total yards per game (306.7), as Geno Smith has thrown a league-high 10 interceptions (compared to just seven touchdowns) while also being sacked 18 times. Rookie running back Ashton Jeanty has two rushing touchdowns in three games after a slow start to the season, although he'll go up against an inconsistent Chiefs defense that managed to keep Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery out of the endzone.  Kansas City's defense is actually allowing almost the same yards per game as Vegas's defense is, but the Chiefs are also producing 360.0 yards per outing on offense. Patrick Mahomes ranks 23rd in the NFL with a 64.8% completion rate but is coming off of a strong showing against Detroit where he threw for 257 yards and had three touchdowns. Isiah Pacheco hasn't scored a rushing touchdown yet this season, so he could try to make a statement against a Raiders run defense that allows 95.3 rushing yards on average.Click here to bet Raiders vs. Chiefs at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if their first bet of at least $5 wins:Model's Raiders vs. Chiefs score prediction, picksThe Chiefs are 2-1-0 ATS at home this season and have been confident at Arrowhead since losing at home to the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 2.

    "body": "\n        Vikings starting quarterback J.J. McCarthy will miss Sunday's game against the Philadelphia Eagles and is likely out for next week's contest against the Los Angeles Chargers while he continues to recover from last month's ankle sprain, ESPN's Adam Schefter reports.McCarthy, the No. 10 pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, went down against the Falcons on Sept. 14 and has missed Minnesota's (3-2) last three games. Carson Wentz has filled in during McCarthy's absence. \"Everybody wants to know when J.J. McCarthy will be back. The fact of the matter is when he sprained his ankle in Week 2, it was supposed to be a six-week injury,\" Schefter said Sunday. \"That means it's unlikely he'll back next week against the Chargers. They're hopeful he'll be back the week after at Detroit in Week 8.\"Vikings coach Kevin O'Connell said McCarthy was \"getting there\" during the rehabilitation process this week, but is not at 100%. While high-ankle sprains are common, rest is paramount in hopes of not re-aggravating the ailment or making it worse.\n\"I'm having a blast coaching [McCarthy],\" O'Connell said. \"It started last week, when he was able to really start ramping up a little bit. That 1-on-1 work, and then obviously the work he does with [quarterback coaches Josh McCown and Jordan Traylor] is going to be critical.\"\n        \n            \n                J.J. McCarthy injury: Vikings QB 'getting there' with hopes to return soon, Kevin O'Connell explains plan\n                \n                    Shanna McCarriston                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWentz, who the Eagles picked No. 2 overall in the 2016 draft, has led the offense during McCarthy's absence and will get his fourth start in Sunday's game against his former team.Wentz has thrown for 759 yards, five touchdowns and two interceptions with a 69% completion rate. Over McCarthy's two appearances this season, the second-year player out of Michigan is completing passes at a 58.5% clip with 301 yards, two touchdowns and three interceptions.\nThe initial prognosis for McCarthy was to be out of action just over a month with the timetable coming to an end in two weeks when the Vikings take on the Detroit Lions on Nov. 2.\"I think the big thing is just getting him back on the grass, in uniform, practicing, getting real live reps of a pass rush and taking drops and applying some of the things that he's worked really hard on as of late, as he's kind of gotten to that phase of his rehab,\" O'Connell said this week.After Sunday's home bout with Philadelphia, the Vikings will be on the road the next two weeks.\n            ",

    "description": "\nThe New England Patriots look to remain perfect on the road when they visit the Tennessee TItans at 1 p.m. ET on Sunday in Week 7 of the 2025 NFL sea",
    "body": "\nThe New England Patriots look to remain perfect on the road when they visit the Tennessee TItans at 1 p.m. ET on Sunday in Week 7 of the 2025 NFL season. New England (4-2), which has won three straight overall and is even with the Buffalo Bills atop the AFC East but owns the tiebreaker, has won all three of its games away from home this year. Tennessee (1-5) returns to Nissan Stadium in Nashville, where it is 0-2 this campaign, after a three-game road trip during which it lost twice.For Sunday's matchup between the Patriots and Titans, top sportsbooks have set the rushing yards prop for Tennessee's Tony Pollard at 45.5 yards, while Drake Maye of New England has his passing yards prop set at 228.5. Before you play a side on Pollard, Maye or any player prop for Week 7 of the NFL season, you need to see what SportsLine player prop expert PropBetGuy has to say. The SportsLine expert has gone 35-28 (+169) in his last 63 NFL player prop picks. Here are his analysis and picks:Troy Franklin Over 32.5 receiving yards (-114, FanDuel)\nFranklin has emerged in his second NFL season as a reliable contributor for the Broncos.The Oregon product has cleared this line in four of six games this season while running the second-most routes for the Broncos. Aligning mostly out of the slot, he'll face the Giants' Andru Phillips, who has allowed the second-most receptions in his coverage among all cornerbacks (per PFF).Overall, the Giants have allowed the second-most receiving yards to opposing receivers, and Franklin should benefit from New York's man-coverage rate (third-highest). I'd bet this up to Over 35.5 receiving yards.Jacoby Brissett Over 33.5 pass attempts (-115, bet365)\nIn a spot start last week in place of the injured Kyler Murray, Brissett threw a whopping 44 passes in a close game against the Colts.With Murray still out for Week 7, I'm expecting Brissett to continue to air it out against Green Bay. The Packers are allowing the most pass attempts per game to opposing quarterbacks (40.4), with opponents throwing at the highest clip against them in neutral game scripts (66%, per Roto Viz).The Cardinals' running game has struggled massively without both James Conner and Trey Benson, and the Packers are only allowing 3.6 yards per carry (fourth-best).I'd bet this up to Over 35.5 attempts, as I have Brissett projected closer to 37 attempts.Tyjae Spears Over 10.5 receiving yards (-114, FanDuel)\nSpears played 59% of Tennessee's offensive snaps last week, including 31 of its 44 pass plays. With Pollard largely inefficient, I'm expecting Spears to continue to dominate the pass-play work, after making four catches for 19 yards last week.The Patriots' run defense is stout (sixth in DVOA, per FTN), and the Titans are without leading receiver Calvin Ridley. New England allows 38 receiving yards to opposing running backs, and I'm expecting a negative game script for the struggling Titans.My projections have Spears closer to 15 receiving yards on Sunday. I'd bet this up to Over 12.5 receiving yards.\n            ",

On Saturday, Montie Quinn of Curry College (Mass.) rushed for 522 yards on 20 carries in the program's 71-27 win against Nichols College.By comparison, the FBS record held by former Oklahoma running back Samaje Perine is only 427 yards. The previous all-division record was 465 yards by another Division IIl runner, Heidelberg's Cartel Brooks in 2013.\nQuinn, listed at only 5-foot-9 and 180 pounds, averaged 26.1 yards per carry and racked up seven touchdowns with his longest touchdown run an 85-yarder. He also scampered for an 84-yard touchdown.\n\"I'm just humbled and grateful. Breaking the record is something I never imagined coming into today,\" Quinn said, per ESPN. \"The O-line was dominating all game, receivers were blocking like crazy, and coaches put us in position to make plays. This belongs to all of us. I just happened to be the one carrying the ball.\"Quinn, from Goose Creek, South Carolina, could've added more rushing yards to his historic total but sat out Curry College's final two drives of the game.\nThe Curry College running back has rushed for 1,450 yards and 17 touchdown in six games throughout the 2025 season. Quinn has reached at least 110 yards in all six of the Colonels' games this season, while rushing for at least 200 yards on three occasions.\n            \n    ",

You can also watch on Paramount+ Premium. Minnesota at Iowa (10/25)Big Ten pair hitting their strideMinnesota and Iowa each hold two-game winning streaks in conference play entering Saturday's game at Kinnick Stadium, a pivotal contest between two unlikely squads who find themselves in the top half of the Big Ten standings just behind several nationally ranked teams. Minnesota's dominant performance last week against Nebraska preceded Iowa's win over Penn State, a pair of momentum-boosting victories leading into Week 9.Four of the last six meetings between the Golden Gophers and Hawkeyes have been decided by a single possession, with Iowa winning five of those games and nine of its last 10 in the series. Iowa running back Kamari Moulton is coming off a 99-yard effort against Penn State while Minnesota's Darius Taylor galloped his way to a season-high 148 yards and a score against the Huskers.Iowa at Nebraska (11/27)Expect a close one on Black FridayIowa and Nebraska have delivered thrills nearly every Thanksgiving weekend for the last decade, and the small margins between the two programs has always packed intensity into their respective regular season finales. The interesting twist here is that while nine of the last 11 games in the rivalry have been decided by seven points or less, nine of the last 11 games have also been won by Iowa. If Matt Rhule and the Cornhuskers are going to have a true breakthrough season in 2025 it doesn't need to include a win over the Hawkeyes necessarily, but it would definitely help the vibes to finish the regular season by snapping this recent run of struggles.CBS Sports will announce additional details on its 2025 roster of game and studio announcers at a later date\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Entering the Week 7 NFL schedule, the spread record for home teams and road teams is dead even, with each side going 46-46-1 ATS.

Chiefs vs. Raiders (+11.5) is the only contest with a line of more than a touchdown, while seven of the 15 matchups have a spread of a field goal or less. Some of these include Eagles vs. Vikings (+1.5), Chargers vs. Colts (+1.5), Cowboys vs. Commanders (+1.5) and 49ers vs. Falcons (+1.5) on Sunday night.Meanwhile, after firing Brian Callahan, Tennessee is a 7-point home underdog versus New England. Tennessee was a stunning 0-10 ATS at home under Callahan, so will it get its first home cover since 2023 against a Pats team that's both won and covered in three straight?

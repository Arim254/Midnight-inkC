    "body": "<div>\n        <p><span>CHICAGO –</span> Given how early it happened and everything that happened afterward -- all those abortive threats by the Milwaukee offense and tense outs recorded by the Chicago bullpen -- it's easy to forget <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3117931/michael-busch/\">Michael Busch</a>'s contributions, his necessary contributions. They're there, though, within the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/gametracker/boxscore/MLB_20251008_MIL@CHC/\">4-3</a> final score that means a Game 4 back in Wrigley Field on Thursday. That's fitting in a sense because it seems like Busch's essential work in 2025 has been overshadowed by those of the bigger names and the more alluring styles who share his uniform.</p><p>In the bottom of the first on Wednesday with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CHC/chicago-cubs/\">Cubs</a> in an early 1-0 hole -- a score that was partly the result of Busch's having lost an infield pop-up in the afternoon sun -- Busch led off the home half against Milwaukee starter <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3117916/quinn-priester/\">Quinn Priester</a>. </p><p>After Busch worked the count full after laying off a 2-2 sinker just off the plate, Priester confronted him with a cutter that didn't cut all that much. Busch did not miss:</p><p>That's Busch's third home run in six postseason games this year, and over that span he's now slashing .300/.364/.750 in these playoffs. The homer above was Busch's only hit of Game 3, but without it the Cubs and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIL/milwaukee-brewers/\">Brewers</a> might still be playing. Oh, that also made Busch the first player in Major League Baseball history to hit multiple leadoff home runs in the same postseason series. </p>\n<p>\"Look, Michael, you can just tell by the way they manage the game, he's become the guy in the lineup that everybody is thinking about and they're doing their pitching around him, and that's a credit to the player,\" Cubs manager Craig Counsell said of Busch after Game 3. \"It really is. It's not easy to do, and he's put us off to a great start a whole bunch of these games.\"</p><p>Busch is not a central-casting kind of leadoff hitter. He's not fast (he's in the 26th percentile in sprint speed), he's a first baseman of all things, he walks at an above-average clip but not necessarily by No. 1 hitter standards, and power is his carrying tool. Still and yet, the Cubs have come to prefer him the role he's filled pretty consistently since the last week of July. Along the way, 16 of his those 34 regular-season home runs came from that leadoff spot. \"Yeah, it doesn't always go that way, but just try to have a good at-bat,\" Busch after Game 3 said of his approach from the top of the batting order. \"From the moment I was placed in that spot, they put me there, and I thought, why change what I do, and just having a good at-bat, staying aggressive, trusting my eyes.\"</p><p>This isn't a case of a regular-season forgettable rising above his established level and finding October glory. With Busch, he's a bedrock producer who's kept on producing after the calendar flipped to that most crucial of baseball months. Just because -- it says here -- Busch doesn't quite get the attention his contributions merit, it doesn't diminish from his overall value to the Cubs. </p>\n<p>During this, his age-27 season, Busch slashed .261/.343/.523 with a team-leading 34 home runs. That slash line is good for an OPS+ of 147 which also led the Cubs and ranked seventh among all qualifiers in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/mlb/\">MLB</a>. As well, Busch in 524 regular-season at-bats hit into just two double plays. He backed up all that production with elite batted-ball metrics, all of which bode very well for his capacity to maintain such strong top-line production moving forward. </p><p>If anything, Busch may have been a bit unlucky this season. On that front, let's look at wOBA, or Weighted On-Base Average, which assigns proper value to every possible offensive event that happens while a batter is at the plate. Those proper valuations of singles, doubles, homers, walks, etc., distinguish wOBA from more traditional measures. Then comes xwOBA, or Expected Weighted On-Base Average. Building off wOBA, xwOBA an estimation of what a hitter's wOBA <em>should</em> be based on quality of contact and batted-ball authority. xwOBA attempts to strip away luck -- bad or good -- and defensive play from wOBA and identify a hitter's baseline skill. It's useful for getting an idea of how a hitter figures to perform in the near-term future. Basically, if a hitter's xwOBA is significantly lower than his wOBA, he's probably going to come back to earth at some point. On the other side of things, if a hitter's xwOBA is quite a bit higher than his wOBA, then better days may be ahead. </p><p>In Busch's case, this season he had a wOBA of .369, which, as you would expect, is excellent. Busch's xwOBA, however, was all the way up at .392, which put him in the 95th percentile among big-league hitters. That's a big gap between wOBA and xwOBA, and it means Busch deserved to be even better than he was. </p>\n<p>Speaking of deserved, he also deserves more attention for what he's done. When he was acquired from the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/LAD/los-angeles-dodgers/\">Dodgers</a> in January of 2024, Busch had the faint whiff of \"failed prospect\" about him, but in part that was a function of the lack of opportunity in L.A. In Chicago, Busch has gotten regular run, and Counsell has put him in a position to succeed by limiting his exposure to left-handed pitching (that's why he wasn't in Counsell's starting lineup for Game 2 against the Brewers opposite <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2836553/aaron-ashby/\">Aaron Ashby</a>). This season, for instance, Busch logged just 19.1% of his plate appearances against same-side pitching. </p><p>So, yes, Busch was something of a platoon player, but the heavy half of a platoon, if they hit like Busch did, is a darned valuable player. Speaking of which, Busch's 4.5 WAR for the season tied that of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2184352/kyle-tucker/\">Kyle Tucker</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2184343/dansby-swanson/\">Dansby Swanson</a> and trailed just that of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2942984/nico-hoerner/\">Nico Hoerner</a> (6.1) <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26615365/pete-crow-armstrong/\">Pete Crow-Armstrong</a> (6.0). Busch is undeniably a fulcrum for the Cubs' offense, just as he was in Wednesday's elimination game. It's not a stretch to say that without Busch, the Cubs may not be playing a Game 4. It's likewise defensible to say that without Busch, the Cubs might not be in the playoffs at all. In light of how little credit accrues to him, all of that may qualify as surprising.</p>\n            </div>",

They were still below .500 in late July and lost by 53 points to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/MIN/minnesota-lynx/\">Minnesota Lynx</a> on Aug. 2. That historic defeat spurred their incredible late-season turnaround, and they closed the regular season on a 16-game winning streak to earn the No. 2 seed. In the playoffs, though, the Aces have not looked so dominant. They needed all three games to defeat the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/SEA/seattle-storm/\">Seattle Storm</a> in the first round, and all five games to get past the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/IND/indiana-fever/\">Indiana Fever</a> in the semifinals. </p>\n<p>No one was sure what would happen with the Mercury this season after their complete overhaul in the winter. Franchise icons <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/1105071/diana-taurasi/\">Diana Taurasi</a> (retirement) and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/2063686/brittney-griner/\">Brittney Griner</a> (free agency) departed, and only two members of their 2024 squad returned. They brought in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/2130768/alyssa-thomas/\">Alyssa Thomas</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677941/satou-sabally/\">Satou Sabally</a> to form a big three with Kahleah Copper, but had a largely untested supporting cast. Their regular-season campaign was choppy at times, in part due to injuries, but they proved they could be a real threat thanks to their top-tier talent. Likewise, their playoff run has been a roller coaster, but they've taken out the reigning champion <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/NYL/new-york-liberty/\">New York Liberty</a> and top-seeded Minnesota Lynx. </p><p>This is the third Finals appearance in the last four seasons for the Aces, who are seeking their third championship in franchise history. The Mercury, meanwhile, are in the Finals for the first time since 2021, and trying to win a fourth title, which would move them into a tie with the Lynx, Seattle Storm and now-defunct Houston Comets for the most all-time. </p>\n<h2>Game 3 Prediction</h2><p>The Mercury moved from 2.5-point underdogs in Game 2 to four-point favorites in Game 3, per <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/caesars-promo-code/\">Caesars</a>, which shows the importance of home-court advantage in this matchup. The Mercury have succeeded in this postseason by overwhelming teams with their energy and physicality, and should have a major emotional edge in this game as they return home facing a 2-0 deficit. This is essentially a must-win for the Mercury, and they'll get the job done. <strong>Pick: Mercury -4.5</strong></p>\n            </div>\n    </div>\n</article>\n        </div>\n                        </div>",

The top-seeded Brewers showed no signs of rust in Game 1 on Saturday. After five days off, the Brewers exploded for six runs in the first inning and cruised to a lopsided win. The Cubs jumped out to a 3-0 lead in the top of the first in Game 2, but the Brewers shut them down the rest of the way and clubbed three homers en route to a 7-3 win. </p><p>On the brink of elimination in Game 3 Wednesday, the Cubs pulled out a win to avoid the sweep and send the series to a Game 4.</p><p>The two NL Central foes are squaring off in the playoffs for the first time ever. The Cubs won the season series, 7-6, but the Brewers still won the division title by five games. In fact, they finished with the best record in baseball at 97-65. As such, the Brewers got a bye and had nearly a week off. The Cubs dealt with a hard-fought Wild Card Series against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SD/san-diego-padres/\">Padres</a>, winning 2-1, in order to make it here. </p><p><em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">Bet Cubs vs. Brewers at DraftKings Sportsbook</a>, where new users get $200 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager. <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">Claim your offer here</a>:</em></p>\n<p>The winner of this series will face the winner of the Dodgers-Phillies series in the NLCS for the pennant.

Flacco will start at Green Bay, and we hope he does wonderful things for Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins.</p><p>For Week 6, I'm going to start Chase in the majority of leagues. He just had a typical Chase game in Week 5 against Detroit with six catches for 110 yards and two touchdowns on 10 targets, and I hope that Flacco can support Chase to the same level as Browning did against the Lions.</p><p>Higgins is tougher to trust because he has struggled without Burrow. Higgins scored against the Lions, but he's had three catches or less in every game this season and no outing with more than 56 receiving yards. His only productive games this season have been the two times he found the end zone, which were Week 2 against Jacksonville and Week 5 against Detroit.</p>\n<p>I'm hoping that Flacco will make plays with Higgins down the field, but we need to see it first. And this isn't an easy matchup against the Packers. Only two receivers have scored more than 10.1 PPR points against Green Bay this season.</p><p>Chase should remain in all lineups. But Higgins is only worth starting in three-receiver leagues. The hope is that Flacco can get both receivers playing at a high level, even against the Packers, and then we can start Chase and Higgins with confidence for the rest of the year.</p>\n<p>Let's see what receivers you should start and sit in Week 6.

for his first touchdown, and hopefully it happens this week against the Cowboys, who are No. 1 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing receivers. In the past four games against Dallas, six receivers have scored at least 15.2 PPR points against the Cowboys, including one in each week, with 10 touchdowns over that span. We hope that trend continues in Week 6, and McMillan has at least eight targets in every game this season. He should be considered a solid No. 2 Fantasy receiver in the majority of leagues.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div>\n</td></tr><tr><td><div>\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n

<p>\n                Diggs is on fire heading into Week 6 at New Orleans, and he should be considered a solid No. 2 Fantasy receiver in the majority of leagues. In his past two games against Carolina and Buffalo, Diggs has combined for 16 catches for 247 yards on 19 targets, and he scored at least 16.1 PPR points in each outing. The Saints are No. 7 in fewest Fantasy points allowed to opposing receivers, but four guys have scored at least 17.9 PPR points against New Orleans this year. I expect Diggs to add his name to that list, and he should continue to play at a high level for the third week in a row.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div>\n</td></tr><tr><td><div>\n

He finished with six catches for 42 yards and one carry for 9 yards, and he only scored 11.1 PPR points. He should rebound this week against the Lions, who are No. 7 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing receivers. Five receivers have scored at least 13.2 PPR points against Detroit this season, including Ja'Marr Chase and Andre Iosivas in Week 5. Worthy should get back on track in Week 6 at home and remains a No. 2 Fantasy receiver in the majority of leagues.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div>\n</td></tr><tr><td><div>\n    <div>\n

They were out in Week 5 at the Rams, and Bourne stepped up with 10 catches for 142 yards on 11 targets. He should continue to be a go-to option for Mac Jones, who is expected to start against the Buccaneers with Brock Purdy (toe) still hurt. And this is a great matchup against Tampa Bay, which has allowed five receivers to score at least 12.9 PPR points this season. As long as Pearsall and Jennings are out, Bourne can be used as a No. 2 Fantasy receiver in the majority of leagues.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div>\n</td></tr><tr><td><div>\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/428.svg\" /></figure>\n                                        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p><span>     \n                        LAC\n                    </span>\n                    <span>     \n                        L.A.

I like Quentin Johnston and Keenan Allen more than McConkey, but he's still worth using as a No. 2 Fantasy receiver in the majority of leagues. He's coming off his best game of the season with 14.9 PPR points since he scored his first touchdown, and we hope that's a sign of things to come. The Dolphins have allowed four receivers to score at least 13.3 PPR points this season, but the Chargers trio should be able to abuse this secondary. Johnston, Allen and McConkey are all worth starting in the majority of leagues.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div>\n</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div><div><p>Sleepers

game of the season in Week 5 against the Chiefs with four catches for 80 yards on six targets, and he scored 12 PPR points. This is where we are now with Thomas, and hopefully we're not settling for 12 PPR points on a weekly basis. He's yet to catch a touchdown, and he's been held to fewer than 50 receiving yards in three of five games. The Seahawks are No. 12 in fewest Fantasy points allowed to opposing receivers, and Seattle's secondary should be able to keep Thomas in check once again. He's only worth starting in three-receiver leagues in Week 6.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div>\n</td></tr><tr><td><div>\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"team

still shaking off the rust in his comeback from last year's ankle injury, but he's struggled so far in his two games this season. He combined for six catches for 52 yards on 14 targets against the Eagles and Seahawks, and it's hard to trust him in Week 6 against the 49ers, who are No. 11 in fewest Fantasy points allowed to opposing receivers. We hope that eventually Godwin will start to produce at a high level, but in Week 6 he's just a No. 3 Fantasy receiver at best in the majority of leagues.\n            </p>\n

including Week 5 against Minnesota in the first start with Dillon Gabriel with two catches for 15 yards on five targets. He might surprise us in Week 6 at Pittsburgh, but it's hard to trust him right now in the majority of leagues. He's yet to score a touchdown, and Gabriel will likely continue to lean on David Njoku and Harold Fannin Jr. against the Steelers on the road. Last year, Jeudy scored at least 14.5 PPR points in each game against Pittsburgh, but we need to see him produce at that level again before starting him again in most formats.\n            </p>\n

only worth starting in three-receiver leagues in Week 6 at Washington. In his first four games, Moore scored 9.6 PPR points or less in three of four games, and he has one touchdown and one game with more than 46 receiving yards. Last year in Week 8 against the Commanders, Moore was held to two catches for 27 yards on four targets, and he could unfortunately have a similar stat line this week given his body of work in 2025.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div>\n</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div><div><div><p>Bust Alert</p><p>Sleepers (Start/Sit)</p></div><div><p>\n                        Projections powered by\n                        <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/season-long-fantasy/?ttag=SL19_lk_cbssports_nfl_cbsprojections\" target=\"_blank\">\n                            <span></span>Sportsline\n                        </a>\n                    </p></div></div><div>\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/423.svg\" /></figure>\n                                        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p><span>     \n                        NYJ\n                    </span>\n                    <span>     \n                        N.Y.

games, including three in a row. He has at least eight targets in every game this season, and he scored four touchdowns already this year. But this week, Wilson has a tough test against the Broncos in London, and he should see plenty of Patrick Surtain II. So far this season, Surtain has limited Calvin Ridley, Michael Pittman, Ja'Marr Chase and A.J. Brown to 9.3 PPR points or less. Given the matchup, I'm only starting Wilson in three-receiver leagues in Week 6.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div></div>\n            </div>\n    </div>\n</article>\n

Even though you drafted your team with certain hopes and intentions, your weekly lineup decisions shouldn't be determined by the order you picked your players in. You need to check who your players play and make sure you've got the right guys in -- and the wrong guys out.         </p><p>We can take some educated guesses based on coaches film, meaningful data, healthy personnel, defensive schemes, track records, and key details of offenses. The things we know can help us minimize the impact of the things we don't know. This should lead to better decisions being made.          </p><p>We'll go through every game and highlight the players who aren't obvious starts and sits (because you don't need to be told to start Puka Nacua). You should feel more comfortable starting or sitting players based on the information given, and feeling comfortable with your Fantasy lineup before the games start is the best feeling in the world.            </p><p><em>All lines from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/caesars-promo-code/\">Caesars Sportsbook</a>.</em>                                              </p><div>\n                    <p>\n                Start 'em\n            </p>\n                <div>\n            <p>\n                10.0-7.00\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                6.99 - 5.01\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                5.00 - 0\n            </p>\n        </div>\n                    <p>\n                Sit 'em\n            </p>\n            </div>\n<p>The Eagles should be able to execute their typical slow-paced and balanced offense, if not a run-heavy plan like they employed in Week 7 last year against the Giants. Philly went into pass-heavy mode when they trailed the Rams by 10-plus points in Week 3 and again last week in a tight matchup against the Broncos. It's hard to envision the Giants keeping up on the scoreboard with Philly after they couldn't do it against the Saints on Sunday. Maybe<em> that's</em> why the Eagles opted to give Saquon Barkley only nine touches last week -- so he'd be fresh to take on his old team on a short week. Obviously in such a game script we'd be wholly dependent on A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith making splash plays in order to be strong Fantasy starts. The Giants have allowed those in bunches -- 17 catches by receivers of 20-plus air yards through five weeks is the second-most in the league, plus they're bottom-10 in deep attempts per game (6.8) and yards after the catch per reception (5.2) to receivers. They've allowed a long touchdown to a speedy receiver in consecutive games. They're both risky, but Brown and Smith deserve at least high-end flex consideration even though they're in a boom-or-bust spot if Hurts doesn't throw a lot.  </p>\n<p>MUST-STARTS: Jalen Hurts, Saquon Barkley </p><p>STARTS: A.J. Brown (No. 2 WR), Cam Skattebo (low-end No. 2 RB), Eagles DST </p><p>FLEX: DeVonta Smith (high-end flex) </p><p>SITS: Jaxson Dart, Theo Johnson and Dallas Goedert (high-end No. 2 TEs), Wan'Dale Robinson (desperation PPR WR), Tyrone Tracy Jr., Jalin Hyatt, Will Shipley, Giants DST </p><div>\n                    <p>\n                Start 'em\n            </p>\n                <div>\n            <p>\n                10.0-7.00\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                6.99 - 5.01\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                5.00 - 0\n            </p>\n        </div>\n                    <p>\n                Sit 'em\n            </p>\n            </div>\n<p>Tough spot for Justin Fields, who came through for Fantasy managers last week when he scored 22.6 of his 29.9 Fantasy points in fourth-quarter garbage time. Denver's been solid against quarterbacks this year (they just held Jalen Hurts to 23.5) and their track record against rushing quarterbacks was good last year and is good again this year. Just ask Fields: He had 27 yards on eight carries with the Steelers against the Broncos last season in a low-scoring, ugly game. New York's defense has been brutal and should force Fields into negative game script, which could give him an opportunity to put up garbage time stats again if the Broncos call off their pass rush, but when that's your best hope for your QB, you should at least consider other options.  </p><p>Maybe Garrett Wilson will need garbage time to save his day, too. Wilson's track record against the Broncos and specifically shutdown CB Pat Surtain II is dreadful: In games in 2022, 2023 and 2024, Wilson has never scored, never topped 54 yards and never had more than five receptions. And while Surtain didn't cover Wilson for every single snap, he did see him a lot and limited him to, per PFF, a total of 58 yards on five catches (10 targets).  </p>\n<p>And don't think Courtland Sutton will get off so easily when it's expected he'll see a lot of Sauce Gardner in coverage. In Sutton's past three against the Jets in 2022, 2023 and 2024, he scored once, never had more than 60 yards and never had more than three receptions. And while Gardner was stupidly used as almost exclusively a left cornerback for those games, he did hold Sutton to, per PFF, a total of 13 yards on one catch (five targets). At least Sutton has a glimmer of hope: The Jets pass rush has been rough this year and the return of Jermaine Johnson might only help them a little bit. It should mean a little more time for Bo Nix to throw.  </p><p>MUST-STARTS: Breece Hall </p><p>STARTS: Justin Fields (low-end starter), JK Dobbins (No. 2 RB), Garrett Wilson (No. 2 WR), Courtland Sutton (No. 2 WR), Mason Taylor (PPR; borderline starter in half & non-PPR), Broncos DST </p><p>SITS: Bo Nix (borderline No. 1/2 QB), Evan Engram, R.J. Harvey, Isaiah Davis, Marvin Mims (desperation WR), Troy Franklin, Josh Reynolds, Jets DST </p>\n<div>\n                    <p>\n                Start 'em\n            </p>\n                <div>\n            <p>\n                10.0-7.00\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                6.99 - 5.01\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                5.00 - 0\n            </p>\n        </div>\n                    <p>\n                Sit 'em\n            </p>\n            </div>\n<p>This is a tough matchup for Derrick Henry in a number of ways. The Rams defense has been great against running backs, allowing 3.5 yards per rush on the year with zero rushing touchdowns and just three explosive runs given up all season. Christian McCaffrey had 57 yards on 22 carries last week; Jonathan Taylor had a long touchdown wiped out by a penalty but otherwise had 76 yards on 17 carries; Saquon Barkley had 46 yards on 18 carries. And of those three, only McCaffrey had more than 15 PPR points thanks to massive amounts of receiving numbers. There's also the expected negative game script that really limits Henry's snaps -- he played 67.5% of their snaps last week in a blowout loss and needed a garbage time touchdown just to get him to 9.3 PPR points.  </p><p>The Ravens' moves this week seemed to be a trade-off of pass rush talent for pass coverage and run defense talent. Odafe Oweh had the most pressures this year for Baltimore, per PFF, but he was a significant liability against the run. C.J. Gardner-Johnson can line up at nickel or safety and can add some turnovers to the unit, but he's been known to miss tackles in space. Alohi Gilman will definitely improve the pass defense in the back of the Ravens secondary and is solid in run support. If the end result is less pass rush pressure on Matthew Stafford, however, then the quarterback should feast just as he did last week against a 49ers pass rush that struggled to fluster him.   </p><p>MUST-STARTS: Puka Nacua, Kyren Williams, Davante Adams </p><p>STARTS: Matthew Stafford, Derrick Henry (low-end No. 2 RB), Zay Flowers (low-end No. 2 WR), Rams DST </p>\n<p>SITS: Cooper Rush, Mark Andrews (No. 2 TE), Justice Hill, DeAndre Hopkins, Rashod Bateman, Tutu Atwell, Ravens DST </p><div>\n                    <p>\n                Start 'em\n            </p>\n                <div>\n            <p>\n                10.0-7.00\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                6.99 - 5.01\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                5.00 - 0\n            </p>\n        </div>\n                    <p>\n                Sit 'em\n            </p>\n            </div>\n<p>The Cowboys sacked Justin Fields five times last week including twice when they got pressure on him inside of two seconds. James Houston, Kenny Clark and Osa Odighizuwa have helped make this defense a little more dangerous than expected, and they're getting it done without blitzing a ton either. Considering the rough shape the Panthers offensive line has been in, the Cowboys could easily have another good game getting after Bryce Young. It doesn't help Young when he's pressured but other than his completion rate (67.2% to 47.3%), his numbers are mostly the same whether or not defenders get near him. He has struggled versus zone coverage, however, averaging 5.4 yards per attempt with one touchdown and four interceptions against zone. That's what Dallas plays the most of week in and week out. As bad as the Cowboys defense has been, Young's been pretty rough himself, making him tough to trust even in a good matchup on paper.  </p><p>Dallas' run defense hasn't been so hot, however. In their past three games, including a matchup where they shut down Chicago's runners, the Cowboys have allowed an explosive run rate of 14.1%, third highest in that stretch, along with a not-good 4.6 yards per carry. Breece Hall and Josh Jacobs each went over 17 PPR points (D'Andre Swift had a good-for-him 10.8). This is where the Panthers should be focused -- attacking the Cowboys run defense with Rico Dowdle, who carried them to a victory over Miami last week.  </p>\n<p>MUST-STARTS: Javonte Williams, George Pickens  </p><p>STARTS: Dak Prescott, Rico Dowdle, Tetairoa McMillan (No. 2 WR), Jake Ferguson </p><p>SITS: Bryce Young, Ryan Flournoy and Xavier Legette (desperation WRs), Tommy Tremble, Jalen Tolbert, Hunter Renfrow, Jaydon Blue, Cowboys DST (desperation DST), Panthers DST </p><div>\n                    <p>\n                Start 'em\n            </p>\n                <div>\n            <p>\n                10.0-7.00\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                6.99 - 5.01\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                5.00 - 0\n            </p>\n        </div>\n                    <p>\n                Sit 'em\n            </p>\n            </div>\n<p>The combination of Arizona's secondary missing multiple starters and its pass rush struggling to get consistent pressure <em>against Tennessee</em> should make for an easy outing for Daniel Jones. A big factor helping Jones is his O-line, which has held three opponents to a pass rush pressure rate under 30% (that's good) and giving up just four sacks (that's real good). It should lead to at minimum a decent week for Jones, just not one where he finishes with a ton of stats; a big week would be more likely if Jonathan Taylor also didn't have a favorable matchup <em>and/or</em> if the Cardinals could put points up on their own.  </p><p>Despite averaging a gross 2.8 yards per carry in a favorable matchup against the Titans, Michael Carter is clearly the Cardinals' lead back. He played nearly 60% of the snaps including 2 of 3 inside the 5, he scored a goal-line touchdown and he didn't drop the football when he crossed the goal line like Emari Demercado did on his monster run last week. Carter also caught all five targets for 22 yards, a crucial development that unquestionably keeps his floor high in PPR leagues. Indy's run defense hasn't been great, giving up 4.5 yards per rush on the season, but they've improved in terms of limiting big gains. The Titans, Rams and Raiders RBs combined for just two rushes of more than 12 yards. That takes some upside away from Carter, who didn't have a run longer than seven yards or a catch longer than nine yards last week anyway. It also might be bad news for Carter if the Colts build a lead and force the Cardinals into hurry-up mode in the second half -- that might mean more work for Demercado, who is still probably the team's favored third-down option. </p>\n<p>MUST-STARTS: Jonathan Taylor, Trey McBride, Tyler Warren, Michael Pittman </p><p>STARTS: Marvin Harrison Jr., Colts DST  </p><p>FLEX: Michael Carter (PPR preferred) </p><p>SITS: Daniel Jones (high-end No. 2 QB), Kyler Murray, Josh Downs, Alec Pierce, Emari Demercado, Greg Dortch, Michael Wilson, Cardinals DST </p><div>\n                    <p>\n                Start 'em\n            </p>\n                <div>\n            <p>\n                10.0-7.00\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                6.99 - 5.01\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                5.00 - 0\n            </p>\n        </div>\n                    <p>\n                Sit 'em\n            </p>\n            </div>\n<p>I'm a little nervous counting on the Seahawks running backs this week against the Jaguars. For starters, Jacksonville has been really good against the run -- 3.9 yards per rush allowed and a slim 5.7% rush rate on 10-plus-yard runs (and 2.3% on explosive 12-plus-yard runs). Not a single running back has gone for more than 57 yards on the ground against Jacksonville and only Kareem Hunt, who scored the first two touchdowns the Jaguars allowed to a back this year, accumulated 10-plus PPR points on rushing stats alone. Where the Jaguars have been smashed by RBs is in the passing game -- Christian McCaffrey was awesome, Chuba Hubbard scored in Week 1 that way and even Chiefs running backs caught all seven targets for 60 yards last Monday. Two problems: One, Sam Darnold has targeted his running backs on 9.4% of his throws, the second-lowest mark for any quarterback this season. Two, Zach Charbonnet has a 29-snap edge in snaps played on pass plays over Kenneth Walker in their four games together, but it's clear both backs split reps, which makes it tough to trust either one regardless of matchup. There's always the chance the Seahawks involve their running backs more through the air, and it's also possible the Jaguars have a let-down game after an emotional win on Monday, but short of those factors we could be looking at a tough week for both Seattle running backs.   </p><p>MUST-STARTS: Jaxon Smith-Njigba </p><p>STARTS: Travis Etienne, Kenneth Walker III (No. 2 RB), Brian Thomas Jr. (low-end No. 2 WR), Seahawks DST, Jaguars DST </p>\n<p>FLEX: Zach Charbonnet (low-end flex) </p><p>SITS: Sam Darnold (high-end No. 2 QB), Trevor Lawrence, Cooper Kupp (desperation PPR flex), Tory Horton (desperation flex), A.J.

From Week 13 through 16, they threw the ball 62.3% of the time, a lot for them. Outside of that four-week stretch when Dobbins was around and the Chargers knew they had a semblance of a run game, they threw 52.4% of the time. Kimani Vidal and Hassan Haskins are backups for a reason: Vidal is a little shifty and physical but inexperienced and has made three plays of 13-plus yards over 176 career snaps. Haskins is a good pass protector and decent receiver but doesn't have much in the way of speed with one play of 13-plus yards over 310 offensive snaps. Even new guy Nyheim Miller-Hines has experience and pretty good hands for receiving but hasn't played an NFL down since 2022 and had two fumbles lost this preseason. Even in a fantastic matchup that Rico Dowdle shredded a week ago, why would the Chargers trust them when they have Justin Herbert, even if Herbert's playing behind a depleted offensive line. </p><p>MUST-STARTS: De'Von Achane </p><p>STARTS: Justin Herbert, Quentin Johnston, Jaylen Waddle (No. 2 WR), Darren Waller (low-end TE) </p>\n<p>FLEX: Ladd McConkey, Keenan Allen </p><p>SITS: Tua Tagovailoa (high-end No. 2 QB), Kimani Vidal, Hassan Haskins, Nyheim Miller-Hines, Malik Washington, Oronde Gadsden, Ollie Gordon II, Dolphins DST, Chargers DST </p><div>\n                    <p>\n                Start 'em\n            </p>\n                <div>\n            <p>\n                10.0-7.00\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                6.99 - 5.01\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                5.00 - 0\n            </p>\n        </div>\n                    <p>\n                Sit 'em\n            </p>\n            </div>\n<p>The only time the Saints went away from zone coverage was in Week 4 when they played a lot of man-to-man coverage on third downs at Buffalo. Rushing quarterbacks like Kyler Murray and Jaxson Dart each saw a lot of zone coverage, so that's probably what Drake Maye will see a lot of unless/until the Patriots build a big lead. The Saints have tried amping up its pass rush over its past three games with a lot of blitzing but it hasn't resulted in a ton of pressure nor a ton of sacks. This should lead to a busy week for Drake Maye, particularly since the Saints run defense is solid overall but especially good at limiting big plays (just three carries of 12-plus rush yards allowed this year, and only one for 16-plus yards). </p><p>STARTS: Drake Maye, Stefon Diggs, Hunter Henry, Chris Olave (low-end PPR WR), Patriots DST (should be good in Weeks 7 and 8 too) </p>\n<p>FLEX: Chris Olave (PPR), Alvin Kamara, Kendre Miller </p><p>SITS: Spencer Rattler, Rashid Shaheed (desperation WR), Juwan Johnson (desperation TE), TreVeyon Henderson, Rhamondre Stevenson, Kayshon Boutte, Taysom Hill, Demario Douglas, Saints DST </p><div>\n                    <p>\n                Start 'em\n            </p>\n                <div>\n            <p>\n                10.0-7.00\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                6.99 - 5.01\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                5.00 - 0\n            </p>\n        </div>\n                    <p>\n                Sit 'em\n            </p>\n            </div>\n<p>This matchup is more challenging for the Steelers' offense than the Browns' offense. It's because Cleveland plays the most man-to-man coverage of any defense in the league and typically can create pass rush pressure without having to blitz. Cleveland has also held opposing running backs to 3.1 yards per carry this year with a 3.0 explosive rush rate allowed. Aaron Rodgers has been one of the worst quarterbacks when pressured this year (a 39.0 RB rating should tell you everything). DK Metcalf has a terrible 5.9% target per route run rate when Rodgers has been pressured and an 8.6% target per route rate against man coverage, and of the four receivers to nab 15-plus PPR points against the Browns this year, three needed touchdowns to get there. And only one running back -- Jahmyr Gibbs, has more than 14 PPR points against the Browns. I'd be careful trying anyone from the Steelers offense.  </p><p>STARTS: Quinshon Judkins, David Njoku, Steelers DST, Browns DST </p><p>FLEX: DK Metcalf, Jaylen Warren (PPR) </p><p>SITS: Aaron Rodgers, Dillon Gabriel, Kenneth Gainwell (stash for a week), Jonnu Smith, Jerry Jeudy, Isaiah Bond (stash), Jerome Ford, Harold Fannin </p><div>\n                    <p>\n                Start 'em\n            </p>\n                <div>\n            <p>\n                10.0-7.00\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                6.99 - 5.01\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                5.00 - 0\n            </p>\n        </div>\n                    <p>\n                Sit 'em\n            </p>\n            </div>\n<p>Jonathan Taylor torched them, but he torches pretty much everyone. D'Andre Swift had a miserable rushing average but caught a few passes and scored on them. Two Commanders running backs totaled nearly 24 PPR points against them. This is what the Raiders have allowed to running backs in their past three games. It's not to guarantee Tony Pollard will follow suit, but the Raiders aren't really in a position to slow anyone down. Pollard still locked up 72% of the snaps and 14 of 19 running back carries for the Titans in Tyjae Spears' first week back. That includes playing all four snaps inside the 10, and it doesn't include three catches Pollard had. I don't like that the Titans are on the road for a third straight week, but if that's the biggest knock Pollard has in a favorable matchup, then he probably makes the cut as a low-end No. 2 running back. </p><p>STARTS: Ashton Jeanty, Tony Pollard, Jakobi Meyers </p><p>FLEX: Tre Tucker, Calvin Ridley </p><p>SITS: Cam Ward, Geno Smith, Elic Ayomanor, Michael Mayer, Tyjae Spears, Chig Okonkwo, Gunnar Helm, Raiders DST, Titans DST </p><div>\n                    <p>\n                Start 'em\n            </p>\n                <div>\n            <p>\n                10.0-7.00\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                6.99 - 5.01\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                5.00 - 0\n            </p>\n        </div>\n                    <p>\n                Sit 'em\n            </p>\n            </div>\n<p>Based on this year's stats alone, Joe Flacco had a better catchable throw rate, a lower interception rate and a lower off-target rate than Jake Browning. He also saw 11 drops while playing for the Browns, hurting all of his other counting stats. And while he had a 22.6% target rate to running backs while in Cleveland, that hasn't been the norm for him throughout his career -- he's more a downfield thrower than a checkdown artist. Not that Jake Browning wasn't interested in throwing downfield, he just wasn't great at it. Flacco appears to be a much better processor of coverage and lot more comfortable throwing downfield than Browning with slightly better accuracy. This should be a step in the right direction for the Bengals passing game, even if we don't see much evidence of it this week. Green Bay has given up 15-plus PPR points to only two receivers this season: George Pickens (33.4 PPR points on 11 targets) and Deebo Samuel (17.4 PPR points on eight targets, a late TD was involved). </p><p>MUST-STARTS: Ja'Marr Chase, Josh Jacobs  </p><p>STARTS: Jordan Love, Tucker Kraft, Packers DST </p><p>FLEX: Tee Higgins, Chase Brown, Romeo Doubs </p><p>SITS: Joe Flacco, Matthew Golden (low-end flex), Christian Watson (stash), Noah Fant, Andrei Iosivas, Samaje Perine, Bengals DST </p><div>\n                    <p>\n                Start 'em\n            </p>\n                <div>\n            <p>\n                10.0-7.00\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                6.99 - 5.01\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                5.00 - 0\n            </p>\n        </div>\n                    <p>\n                Sit 'em\n            </p>\n            </div>\n<p>At Seattle, Chris Godwin's snap share dipped by 10, his route rate slid from 93% to 79%, he lined up in the slot on 42% of his plays (that rate went up from Week 4), but his ADOT cratered from 14.6 yards to a measly 2.75 yards. You probably also noticed his targets sag from 10 in Week 4 to four in Week 5 -- and for good reason: The Seahawks found themselves double-teaming Godwin throughout the game, mostly on middle-of-the-field routes. Why they did that when Emeka Egbuka and Sterling Shepard, both clearly quicker than Godwin, tore them apart is beyond me. The 49ers tend to play zone-heavy coverage, mostly Cover-3 much like the Seahawks opted for last week, but since losing defensive end Nick Bosa to a torn ACL they've greatly reduced their blitz rates and haven't gotten much pressure on the quarterback (just two sacks). Godwin has nine of his 14 targets when Baker Mayfield hasn't been pressured, but Egbuka has 14 of his 17 targets in the same scenario. I'd be a little squeamish trusting Godwin as anything more than a low-end flex, even if this figures to be a moderately high-scoring game.  </p><p>MUST-STARTS: Christian McCaffrey, Emeka Egbuka </p><p>STARTS: Baker Mayfield, Rachaad White, Jake Tonges  </p><p>FLEX: Kendrick Bourne  </p><p>SITS: Mac Jones (high-end No. 2 QB), Chris Godwin (low-end flex), Demarcus Robinson Brian Robinson Jr., Sean Tucker, Sterling Shepard (desperation WR), Cade Otton (desperation TE), Buccaneers DST, 49ers DST </p><div>\n                    <p>\n                Start 'em\n            </p>\n                <div>\n            <p>\n                10.0-7.00\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                6.99 - 5.01\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                5.00 - 0\n            </p>\n        </div>\n                    <p>\n                Sit 'em\n            </p>\n            </div>\n<p>Not one of Jared Goff's 12 touchdowns this season have come when he's been pressured. His QB rating when pressured is 67.8, which pales in comparison to the 137.3 he has when he's not pressured. His completion rate, yards per attempt and off-target rate all go in the wrong direction when he's pressured. And wouldn't you know it? The Chiefs lead the NFL not only in pass rush pressure rate (46.4%) but specifically pass rush pressure rate without blitzing (49.2%). When pressured this year, Goff has leaned on Sam LaPorta the most (25.6% target per route rate), followed by Jameson Williams (20.4%). Where are Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jahmyr Gibbs? Insanely low: 9.8% and 12.9% target per route rate respectively. I don't think anyone will ever sit those guys, but maybe giving some thought to LaPorta and Williams isn't a bad idea, especially if Goff ends up having to find targets against man coverage while running from Chris Jones & Co.  </p><p>MUST-STARTS: Patrick Mahomes, Jahmyr Gibbs, Amon-Ra St. Brown  </p><p>STARTS: Xavier Worthy, Sam LaPorta, Travis Kelce </p><p>FLEX: David Montgomery, Jameson Williams (low-end flex)  </p><p>SITS: Jared Goff, Tyquan Thornton (desperation flex), Kareem Hunt, Isiah Pacheco, Isaac TeSlaa, Chiefs DST (desperation starter), Lions DST </p><div>\n                    <p>\n                Start 'em\n            </p>\n                <div>\n            <p>\n                10.0-7.00\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                6.99 - 5.01\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                5.00 - 0\n            </p>\n        </div>\n                    <p>\n                Sit 'em\n            </p>\n            </div>\n<p>Buffalo earned a fourth-best 42.7% pass rush pressure rate on non-blitzes, which is particularly great since they aren't a blitz-heavy defense. Might this be problematic for the Falcons passing game including Drake London and Kyle Pitts? When their quarterback has been pressured this year, London has seen a very low 14.3% target per route run rate. Pitts hasn't fared much better, sitting at 15%. Naturally, London (34.4%) and Pitts (20%) have led the Falcons in target per route run rate when their quarterback isn't pressured, and that's when their numbers are at their best. Obviously, Penix won't be pressured on every snap, which keeps the door open for London to have a good game (Pitts too). But you should know Buffalo has allowed five touchdowns and three 15-plus PPR point games to WRs, and one touchdown with zero 10-plus-point PPR games to TEs this season.  </p><p>MUST-STARTS: Josh Allen, Bijan Robinson, James Cook </p><p>STARTS: Drake London (borderline No. 1/2 WR), Dalton Kincaid, Kyle Pitts (low-end starter), Bills DST  </p><p>FLEX: Khalil Shakir  </p><p>SITS: Michael Penix Jr., Darnell Mooney, Keon Coleman, Tyler Allgeier, Ray Davis, Falcons DST </p><div>\n                    <p>\n                Start 'em\n            </p>\n                <div>\n            <p>\n                10.0-7.00\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                6.99 - 5.01\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                5.00 - 0\n            </p>\n        </div>\n                    <p>\n                Sit 'em\n            </p>\n            </div>\n<p>There's a chance the Bears play this game with two backup tackles lining up against the Commanders' quality pass rush. When pressured this season, Caleb Williams has been awful when pressured so far this season, completing 48.6% of his throws for 4.3 yards per attempt with one touchdown and a concerning 20% off-target rate. Washington's pass rush pressure rate has been good -- 37.8% -- when they haven't blitzed, which they may not have to do in this game. Williams wasn't blitzed much by the Raiders in Week 4 (a defense built similarly to the Commanders) and he still had a rough game stat-wise. I'm a little nervous about Williams' upside, especially given his protection problems.  </p><p>There isn't anything about the Bears defense that should scare you out of starting Jayden Daniels. They've played a lot of man-to-man coverage this year, but doing that against a rushing quarterback like Daniels is a recipe for disaster. I'd expect a good amount of zone coverage. The Bears' pass rush couldn't get going against the Raiders in Week 4. It should be a smooth week for Daniels, but it might be an explosive week for Jacory Croskey-Merritt. Chicago's run defense has been among the worst in football this year and especially in its past three games when they've allowed more than 6.0 yards per rush and a league-high 15.7% explosive run rate to RBs. For a speedster like Croskey-Merritt, the matchup is as good as it gets. Three RBs have hit at least 15 PPR points in four games against Chicago. In fact, the matchup might be so good that Daniels may not have to throw it a lot nor run it a lot as he eases his way back into form after missing time with a knee injury.  </p><p>MUST STARTS: Deebo Samuel </p><p>STARTS: Jayden Daniels, Caleb Williams, Jacory Croskey-Merritt, Rome Odunze, D'Andre Swift (low-end No. 2 RB in PPR), Commanders DST </p><p>FLEX: DJ Moore (PPR) </p><p>SITS: Zach Ertz (No. 2 TE), Colston Loveland (stash!), Luther Burden, Chris Rodriguez, Jeremy McNichols, Olamide Zaccheaus, Luke McCaffrey, Bears DST </p>\n            </div>",

The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/DET/detroit-tigers/\">Detroit Tigers</a> had hopes of getting a bye for nearly the entire season, but blowing a 14-game lead in the AL Central meant they needed to hit the road in the Wild Card Series as a No. 6 seed. No matter -- the Tigers took down the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CLE/cleveland-guardians/\">Guardians</a> in three games to advance here.</p><p>Detroit eked out an extra-inning win in Game 1 and Seattle needed late-inning heroics to even up the series with a Game 2 victory. Despite a ninth-inning rally by the Tigers in Game 3 Tuesday, the Mariners held on to win 8-4. Detroit won't go down easily, though, and the series is headed to a win-or-go-home Game 5 Friday after the Tigers won 9-3 in Game 4.</p><p>The Tigers and Mariners have never squared off in the playoffs before, so it's a fresh matchup. The Tigers haven't won the World Series since 1984, while the Mariners are the only team in baseball to have never been to the World Series. <em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">Bet Tigers vs. Mariners at FanDuel Sportsbook</a>, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:</em></p>\n<h2>Mariners vs. Tigers schedule</h2><table><tbody><tr><th><br />  </th><th>Date</th><th>Start time/score</th><th>TV</th><th>Live stream</th></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Game 1</strong> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>Sat., Oct. 4</p></td><td><p>DET 3, SEA 2</p></td><td><p>FS1</p></td><td><a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191273?irad=377812&irmp=416484&sharedid=HTW\" target=\"_blank\">fubo</a></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Game 2</strong> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>Sun., Oct. 5</p></td><td><p>SEA 3, DET 2</p></td><td><p>FS1</p></td><td><a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191273?irad=377812&irmp=416484&sharedid=HTW\" target=\"_blank\">fubo</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Game 3</strong></td><td>Tues., Oct. 7</td><td>SEA 8, DET 4</td><td>FS2, MLBN</td><td><a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191273?irad=377812&irmp=416484&sharedid=HTW\" target=\"_blank\">fubo</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Game 4</strong></td><td>Wed., Oct. 8</td><td>DET 9, SEA 3</td><td>FS1</td><td><a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191273?irad=377812&irmp=416484&sharedid=HTW\" target=\"_blank\">fubo</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Game 5 (if nec.)</strong></td><td>Fri., Oct. 10</td><td>4:40 p.m. or 8:08 p.m. ET</td><td>FS1 or Fox</td><td><a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191273?irad=377812&irmp=416484&sharedid=HTW\" target=\"_blank\">fubo</a></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Mariners vs. Tigers: Game 5 info</h2><ul><li><strong>Time</strong>: 4:40 p.m. ET | <strong>Date</strong>: Fri., Oct. 10</li><li><strong>Location</strong>: Comerica Park -- Detroit</li><li><strong>TV channel</strong>: FS1 | <strong>Live stream</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191273?irad=377812&irmp=416484&sharedid=HTW\" target=\"_blank\">fubo</a> (Try for free)</li><li><strong>Starting pitchers</strong>: LHP Tarik Skubal (DET) vs. TBA (SEA)</li><li><strong>Odds</strong>: Tigers -132, Mariners +109 (via DraftKings)</li></ul>\n<h2>Game 5 storylines</h2><p><strong>Tigers</strong>: After the Detroit offense lay mostly dormant for the first two games, the Tigers lineup rallied in the ninth inning of Game 3 and then went off in Game 4 to force a Game 5.

Yeah, the Mariners now have to beat the likely Cy Young winner or they're headed home for the winter.

The former Alabama and Oklahoma standout continues to be a dual-threat force for Philadelphia, demonstrating excellence both through the air and on the ground. In the 2024 season, he threw for 2,903 yards, 18 touchdowns, and five interceptions, while also rushing for 630 yards and 14 scores. </p><p>In 2025 so far, he has totaled 889 passing yards, seven touchdowns, and zero interceptions. Against the New York Giants in his career, Hurts holds a 6-3 record, throwing for 1,244 yards, six touchdowns, and six interceptions with a 74.8 passer rating. His elite dual-threat ability gives him a relatively high DFS floor compared to other players on the TNF slate. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-picks-thursday-night-football-eagles-vs-giants-fantasy-lineup-advice-projections-for-draftkings-fanduel-from-millionaire-maker-contest-winner/#ttag=10072025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_jimmiekaylor_EaglesGiantsDFS\" target=\"_blank\">See who else to roster right here</a>.</p>\n<p>Part of Kaylor's optimal NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering Giants running back Cam Skattebo. The former Arizona State standout has burst onto the NFL scene as a rookie in 2025. His opportunities have grown in part because of injury to incumbent back <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2963637/tyrone-tracy-jr/\">Tyrone Tracy Jr.</a>, but he has made it hard for the Giants to keep him off the field nonetheless.</p><p>Skattebo enters Week 6 with 63 carries for 240 yards and two rushing touchdowns. He's added 18 catches for 143 yards on 22 targets. His bruising running style and pass catching ability make him a dynamic threat in the red zone. This is also a plus-matchup for Skattebo as the Eagles have allowed the eighth-most Fantasy points to opposing running backs this season. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-picks-thursday-night-football-eagles-vs-giants-fantasy-lineup-advice-projections-for-draftkings-fanduel-from-millionaire-maker-contest-winner/#ttag=10072025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_jimmiekaylor_EaglesGiantsDFS\" target=\"_blank\">You can see the rest of Kaylor's NFL DFS picks here</a>.</p><p><em>New users can see the latest </em><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>FanDuel promo code</em></a></span><em> to </em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\"><em>get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins</em></a><em>:</em></p>\n<h2>How to build NFL DFS lineups and stacks for Eagles vs. Giants</h2><p>Kaylor is also targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on Thursday Night Football.

Yup, they were surprised by their own trade. The Browns weren't the only ones surprised by the move, though, as the trade sent shockwaves around the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a>. </p><p>The Flacco deal had an <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/three-reasons-why-joe-flacco-trade-actually-makes-sense-for-bengals/\" target=\"_blank\">immediate impact on three teams</a></span>: the Bengals, the Browns and the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/GB/green-bay-packers/\">Packers</a>. </p><p>The Bengals (2-3) are trying to <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/joe-flacco-trade-grades-browns-get-rewarded-for-dumping-40-year-old-qb-bengals-take-big-swing/\" target=\"_blank\">save their season</a></span> following the Week 2 injury to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2179798/joe-burrow/\">Joe Burrow</a>. As for the Browns, they just threw a lifeline to a division rival. With the move, Flacco became just the third quarterback since 2000 to be involved in an in-division trade. </p><p>On Green Bay's end, Bengals head coach Zac Taylor has already announced that Flacco <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/joe-flacco-to-start-against-packers-bengals-zac-taylor-explains-why-veteran-qb-is-best-fit-for-cincinnati/\" target=\"_blank\">will start Sunday</a></span>, so the Packers now have to prepare for the only quarterback who has beaten them this season. </p>\n<p>So, how did each of these teams react to the trade? Glad you asked. Let's check in on the Bengals, Browns and Packers to see just how shocked they were. </p><h2>Packers HC Matt LaFleur was surprised</h2><p>The 2-1-1 Packers only have one loss this season, and it came at the hands of Flacco, who led the Browns to a 13-10 win over Green Bay in Week 3. </p><p>Three weeks later, LaFleur finds himself preparing to face the same quarterback, and it's definitely not something he's used to. \"Outside of a division game, I don't think I've ever seen the same quarterback on a different team, so it will be interesting,\" LaFleur <a href=\"https://x.com/packers/status/1975961566307659915\" target=\"_blank\">said Wednesday</a>. </p>\n<p>\"I certainly was a little surprised,\" the Packers head coach added.</p><p>Flacco will only have four days to prepare for his first start with the Bengals, but LaFleur definitely won't be underestimating Cincinnati's new quarterback. </p><p>\"I'd say that Joe Flacco has been playing this game for a really long time and he's been in a lot of different systems, so I'd bet that he'd have no problem picking it up in a short period of time,\" LaFleur said. \"I think the hardest thing for them is going to be the nuances of your cadence, your snap count, the rapport you have with the other players. Now, he's pretty fortunate, he has some good guys to certainly throw to.\"</p><p>Flacco's first game against the Packers was in Cleveland, but this one will be played in Green Bay. </p>\n<h2>Browns HC Kevin Stefanski was surprised</h2><p>Sending Flacco to Cincinnati was a bizarre move for the Browns. With <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180355/jake-browning/\">Jake Browning</a> under center, the Bengals' season was sinking, but the Browns decided to send them a lifeboat in the form of Flacco. Stefanski admitted he was caught off-guard by the trade. </p><p>\"First, I'd tell you, the Joe trade took us by surprise,\" Stefanski <a href=\"https://x.com/Browns/status/1975955717552214269\" target=\"_blank\">said Wednesday</a>. \"That was not something that we saw coming. They called us. It happened very fast.\"</p><p>Stefanski was asked if the team had planned on trading Flacco and he gave a hard \"no.\"</p>\n<p>Trading Flacco to a division rival is an interesting move that will be questioned even more if the Bengals bounce back to win the AFC North. Why trade him to a division rival? According to Stefanski, Browns general manager Andrew Berry made the call.</p><p>\"Obviously, AB makes those decisions,\" Stefanski said. \"I trust AB. We talk about every decision we make. They wanted Joe. They made the phone call. Obviously, it gives Joe an opportunity to go play again, but I trust in our decisions.\"</p><p>Stefanski didn't really have an answer when asked if there was any concern about sending Flacco to southwest Ohio. </p>\n<p>\"I'll let Andrew speak to that. I don't want to speak for him, but I trust in his decisions.\"</p><p>The Browns didn't get much in return for Flacco, and this trade could backfire if Flacco ends up saving Cincinnati's season. If that happens, fans in Cleveland will likely be wondering why the Browns were willing to do a favor for a hated rival. </p><p>Now, let's move on to the Bengals' locker room, where there was also plenty of surprise. </p>\n<h2>Orlando Brown Jr. spent his rookie year with Flacco</h2><p>The Bengals currently have three players on their roster who have played with Flacco at some point in their career: Orlando Brown Jr. (2018 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BAL/baltimore-ravens/\">Ravens</a>), <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2251095/noah-fant/\">Noah Fant</a> (2019 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DEN/denver-broncos/\">Broncos</a>) and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2141721/dalton-risner/\">Dalton Risner</a> (2019 Broncos). Brown's one season with Flacco came in Baltimore during the offensive tackle's rookie year. </p><p>\"He was very influential for me as a young player coming into this league,\" Brown said Wednesday. \"Just having a veteran quarterback to learn from, how he likes to see things, what his expectations are from a tackle, all of those things were really important to me coming in, important to him. In terms of a guy that helped me model my game, he's a big factor in that.\"</p><p>Brown had no idea the Bengals were thinking about adding Flacco, and he was as shocked as anyone when he heard about the news. That said, he's excited about the addition.</p>\n<p>\"I definitely think that it does bring juice,\" Brown said. \"It brings in a positive energy, a new energy.\"</p><h2>Noah Fant caught his first touchdown from Flacco</h2><p>Noah Fant's rookie year came back in 2019 with the Broncos, which just happened to be Flacco's one season with the team. In Week 4, Fant caught his first career touchdown pass against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/JAC/jacksonville-jaguars/\">Jacksonville Jaguars</a>, and he is very aware that Flacco threw him the ball. </p><p>\"He threw me my first touchdown against the Jags,\" Fant said. \"What a cool experience for me personally, to just have that guy who helped me take those steps along in the league during my rookie year, and have him back with me is pretty cool.\"</p>\n<p>Flacco was in Cleveland on Tuesday before driving down to Cincinnati on Tuesday night. By Wednesday afternoon, he was on the practice field. Considering how crazy things were for Flacco over the past 24 hours, Fant was impressed with how well the 40-year-old handled himself at practice. </p><p>\"Practice ran pretty smoothly and pretty seamlessly,\" the Bengals tight end said. \"I thought he did a great job for the first day and I'm excited to be out there playing with him and we'll see what happens.\"</p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2965160/chase-brown/\">Chase Brown</a> reveals how the Bengals plan to get Flacco up to speed</h2><p>The Bengals running back will be taking handoffs from Flacco this week, although he certainly wasn't expecting that to happen. </p>\n<p>\"Was I surprised? Yeah. I didn't expect it, to be honest,\" Brown said. </p><p>If you're wondering how the Bengals plan to get Flacco ready to start against the Packers in just four days, Brown explained a few of the steps that the team is taking.</p><p>\"We just did a post-practice walkthrough to kind of go through some plays and show Joe where everybody's going to end up in specific concepts, so that was kind of cool,\" Brown said. \"Just so he can kind of jog his memory and get ahead mentally. I think that's the only different thing as far as preparation-wise this week.\"</p><p>When Flacco takes the field, he'll become the first quarterback since <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1246081/jimmy-clausen/\">Jimmy Clausen</a> in 2015 to face the same opponent twice in one season with two different teams. </p><h2>The kicker still hasn't met Flacco</h2><p>Bengals kicker <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2962681/evan-mcpherson/\">Evan McPherson</a> knows that Flacco is on the same team as him because he's seen the quarterback in the locker room, but as of Wednesday afternoon, he still hadn't met his new teammate. </p><p>\"I think he's a really impressive quarterback, haven't really got to spend much time or meet him,\" McPherson said.</p><p>If you're wondering who was the last guy in the locker room to find out about the trade, it might have been McPherson. Tuesday is an off-day for Bengals players, and the kicker doesn't use his phone much, so he had no idea a trade had actually happened until he got a random text from punter Ryan Rekhow. </p><p>\"I saw a text from Ryan and he was like, 'What do you think about the trade?' And I was like, 'Trade? Who did we get,\" McPherson said. \"So I go on Instagram and, of course, it's the first thing I see.\"</p><p>That's right, McPherson found out about the trade on Instagram, an app that didn't even exist during Flacco's rookie year in 2008. </p><h2>Bengals DC: 'I don't think he'll get rattled'</h2><p>The Bengals actually played against the Browns back in Week 1, so Golden had to spend an entire week game-planning for Flacco, so he has a unique perspective on Cincinnati's newest player. According to Golden, Flacco can still sling it. </p><p>\"He can still get the ball down the field. That's evident,\" Golden said. \"He can get the ball to playmakers down the field, which obviously opens up everything underneath, whether that's Mike [Gesicki], Noah [Fant], all of those things. ... The fact that he can push it down the field and it's not just a guy managing the game. This guy can throw it. Anybody can see that just being out there right now.\"</p><p>Golden also has total confidence that Flacco will be able to play at a high level Sunday, despite just four days of preparation. </p><p>\"I don't think he'll get rattled,\" Golden said. \"Obviously, teams will come after him because there's a new procedure and things of that nature, but he can see it. He has great vision, his pre-snap awareness is awesome. He'll kick the ball out if he gets the right look. I just think he plays with a lot of poise.\"</p><h2>Bengals HC Zac Taylor wastes no time getting Flacco up to speed</h2><p>After the Bengals made the trade for Flacco on Tuesday, Taylor decided instantly that Flacco would be the starter on Sunday against the Packers. With that in mind, Taylor knew he had to immediately start the process of getting his new quarterback prepared. The Bengals sent a driver to Flacco's house in Cleveland, and during the car ride to Cincinnati, Taylor was already on the phone with his new signal-caller. </p><p>\"We talked on the phone while he drove,\" Taylor said Wednesday. \"We just tried to cover all the base pieces of information. I mean, you like to knock out personnel and formations and motions and the easy stuff, and then when you get in here, get the nuts and bolts. So, probably talk some run game, I think, on the phone too, got into the run game plan and just the easy stuff that he knew, and it all sounded familiar. So he'll be ready to roll.\"</p><p>One advantage for the Bengals this week is that Flacco will be playing a Packers defense that he's already seen. </p><p>\"He's played Green Bay this year, so he's already gone through a week of prep,\" Taylor said. \"That's the nice part. The communication and the weekly rhythm is maybe different and unique. He's already prepared for this opponent. He gets a chance to refresh himself on that, while at the same time learning our system and our terminology and our verbiage and how we operate. He hasn't played there this year, so the crowd noise and all that stuff is different, but at least he's got some experience playing against them.\"</p><p>One other thing that Taylor likes is that Flacco is a 40-year-old veteran who has seen everything. </p><p>\"It's different than a young quarterback coming in trying to learn the system and understand what a defense is trying to do to challenge you,\" Taylor said. </p><p>When Flacco takes the field on Sunday, he'll become the first 40-year-old to ever play for the Bengals. It would certainly be a surprise if Cincinnati, a 14-point underdog, won in Green Bay, but this has been a week of surprises for Flacco and the Bengals, so don't rule anything out.</p>\n            </div>",

Antetokounmpo's future in Milwaukee has been in doubt all summer, with the star mulling the possibility of seeking greener pastures after another early playoff exit and serious questions about the Bucks' roster. Despite those rumblings, Antetokounmpo is in Milwaukee as training camp begins with a singular focus on trying to lead the Bucks to a second championship in 2025-26. </p><p>Antetokounmpo addressed the latest rumors Wednesday and insisted that while he's \"locked into\" the Bucks for this season, he reserves the right to change his mind in \"<a href=\"https://x.com/eric_nehm/status/1976003996268757136\" target=\"_blank\">six, seven months</a>\" if he feels like the team isn't headed in the right direction. </p><p>\"First of all, I haven't read that story. When the season starts, I try to get off social media and I try to focus on my craft and the team, but yeah, I've said this many times, I want to be in a situation that I can win and now I'm here,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"I believe in this team. I believe in my teammates. I'm here to lead this team to wherever we can go and it's definitely going to be hard. We're going to take it day-by-day, but I'm here. So all the extra stuff does not matter.\"</p><p>This is all you can really ask for as a Bucks fan, and Antetokounmpo has certainly earned the trust that he's going to put his full effort into this Bucks team as long as he's there. Antetokounmpo will use this season to figure out whether the team is in position to help him achieve his goals of winning another championship, and that puts ample pressure on coach Doc Rivers and the supporting cast in Milwaukee to deliver this year. </p>\n<p>What we don't know is where that threshold is for Antetokounmpo to believe he's being provided the opportunity to win. Do the Bucks need to make the Eastern Conference Final to give him that sense? Is there a scenario in which an earlier exit still instills enough confidence that they're on the right path? Only Antetokounmpo knows that, but for now, he's going to do everything in his power to give the Bucks the chance to hit that mark. We'll find out next summer whether they've succeeded. The Giannis question may be pushed to the back burner for this season, but it will be back in full force whenever their 2025-26 campaign ends. </p>\n            </div>\n    </div>",

Both college football games have spreads less than a field goal, and the SportsLine model has two of its Wednesday best bets at DraftKings coming from those contests, including Liberty (-1.5) to cover against UTEP in an 8 p.m. ET matchup on CBS Sports Network.

Each of the first three games of the Blue Jays vs. Yankees series has gone Over their run totals, averaging 15.3 runs per game, and that's a trend the model expects to continue, making Over 8.5 runs one of its Wednesday best bets at DraftKings.

It enters the second week of the 2025 MLB playoffs a profitable 35-29 on top-rated MLB money-line picks this season. It is also a profitable 38-25 combined on money-line and over/under <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/college-football/picks/\" target=\"_blank\">college football picks</a> since the beginning of 2024.

Aaron Judge displayed his greatness yet again with a three-run home run on Tuesday in a game that featured three home runs. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hit his third home run of the series for Toronto on Tuesday. The Blue Jays are going with a bullpen game, which could boost the Yankees' offensive output, and the model expects this Over trend to continue, projecting the Over to hit in 53.4% of simulations.</p><h3>Middle Tennessee (+110) to defeat Missouri State</h3><p>Finding a three-year starting quarterback in college football isn't as rare as it was decades ago, however, finding a three-year starter at one school isn't nearly as common in today's college football landscape. Middle Tennessee has that advantage with fifth-year senior Nicholas Vattiato at quarterback. Vattiato has spent all five years at Middle Tennessee and has thrown for more than 3,000 yards in back-to-back seasons. His completion percentage is down to 58.7% this season, but he completed more than 64% of his passes in the last two seasons, and Missouri State ranks 123rd of 136 teams in completion percentage against (69.05%). Missouri State (2-3) is in its first year as an FBS program, and although Middle Tennessee is 1-4 this season, the Blue Raiders do have homefield advantage. The model projects Middle Tennessee to win in 56% of simulations despite being plus-money underdogs.</p><h3>Liberty (-1.5) vs. UTEP</h3><p>Liberty defeated UTEP by 14 and 18 points over the previous two seasons, and the model likes the Flames' chances at ending their four-game skid on Wednesday against the team they've defeated relatively easily over recent seasons. Liberty and UTEP are both 1-4 entering this matchup on CBS Sports Network. UTEP ranks 119th in scoring (15.5 ppg) in the nation with the third-worst completion percentage (51.72%) in the country. Meanwhile, Liberty ranks 18th in the nation in passing yards against (170.5). Liberty went 21-5 over the previous two seasons as Jamey Chadwell enters his third year as head coach, and despite the slow start for the Flames, the model projects Liberty to cover the spread in 68% of simulations. <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">Bet it at DraftKings here</a>:</p><h2>Want more college football picks and MLB picks for Wednesday?</h2><p><strong>You've seen the model's Wednesday best bets.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>When the season began, one wouldn't have imagined that coveted Week 6 Fantasy football picks consisted of names like Rico Dowdle, Javonte Williams, Kendrick Bourne or Ryan Flournoy. But they all had 100-plus scrimmage yards on Sunday, with Dowdle going north of 200. Did they just have good matchups, or did their performances shoot them up the Week 6 Fantasy football rankings? Both recent performances and current matchups should be taken into account when making Fantasy football start/sit decisions.</p><p>Dowdle had 206 yards versus the Dolphins, who will host the Chargers on Sunday. L.A. has now lost both Najee Harris and Omarion Hampton to IR, leaving Hassan Haskins and Kimani Vidal as the next men up in the backfield. Should either, or both, make their way into Week 6 Fantasy football lineups?

Brown, Jonathan Taylor, Derrick Henry, Christian McCaffrey, Alvin Kamara and Jahmyr Gibbs. Anybody who banked on players like those could have made a run at their league title.</p><p>Now, the model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, has revealed its Fantasy football rankings for Week 6 of the 2025 NFL season. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-nfl-week-6-projections-from-proven-model-that-outperformed-experts/#ttag=10072025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_Week6FFrankings\" target=\"_blank\">Head to SportsLine now to see them</a>. </p><p><em>New users can also check out the latest </em><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>FanDuel promo code</em></a></span><em> and </em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\"><em>get $300 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins</em></a><em>. </em></p><h2>Top Week 6 Fantasy football picks </h2><p>One surprise in Week 6: The model is fading Lions quarterback Jared Goff, a two-time Pro Bowler who leads the NFL with 12 passing touchdowns. Goff ranks 10th in Fantasy points amongst quarterbacks this year, but much of his success came in two games against a pair of teams who rank in the bottom five in scoring defense in Cincinnati and Chicago. In Goff's other three contests, he's averaging just 198.3 passing yards with four total touchdowns and a pair of turnovers.</p><p>Detroit visits Kansas City on Sunday night in Week 6, and only three teams have allowed fewer passing touchdowns than the Chiefs. They're also top 10 in passing yards allowed, as only one opposing quarterback has had more touchdowns than interceptions versus Kansas City, which has held its last four opposing QBs to just 157.3 passing yards. Thus, Goff may not warrant a spot in Week 6 Fantasy football lineups as he sits outside the top 15 in positional rankings.</p><p>Another curveball: The model is high on Raiders wideout Tre Tucker. The third-year pro out of Cincinnati is coming off a 71-yard outing in Week 5 and has been one of the most surprising Fantasy players this season. He is the WR16 in PPR scoring and is the WR10 in standard leagues. Tucker is tied for the team lead with four touchdowns, and his 315 scrimmage yards top both Jakobi Meyers (290) and Brock Bowers (225) amongst Raiders' pass catchers.</p><p>Vegas takes on Tennessee on Sunday, and few defenses are as giving to wideouts as the Titans are. They allow the fifth-most receiving yards per game to opposing wide receivers, and just eight teams have given up more catches to the position. Tennessee has seen eight different opposing wideouts have at least 67 receiving yards or a touchdown versus the team this season, with three receivers reaching both of those thresholds. Tucker is slotted as a top-20 Fantasy wideout by the model in Week 6.

    "body": "<div>\n        <div><p>The best quarterbacks in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> have a knack for making things look easy. The great irony is that it's not. It's the product of an immensely talented individual having enough repetition to feel the confidence that comes along with mastery of a craft. It's a combination that shines almost immediately when you see it.  </p><p> Through five weeks of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football</a> season, no quarterback has exuded that quality more so than <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OREG/oregon-ducks/\">Oregon's</a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28895698/dante-moore/\">Dante Moore</a>. In only his ninth career start, Moore walked into a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/PSU/penn-state-nittany-lions/\">Penn State</a> whiteout and <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/2025-heisman-trophy-roundtable-dante-moore-john-mateer-among-standout-candidates-through-september/\" target=\"_blank\">took down the No. 3 team in the country</a></span>. He completely outdueled <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28876938/drew-allar/\">Drew Allar</a> in the process and only put the ball in harm's way once all day on an overtime two-point conversion.  </p><p> While Moore's talent has been evident since he was the No. 4 overall recruit, <a href=\"https://247sports.com/player/dante-moore-46084709/high-school-235999/\" target=\"_blank\">per 247Sports</a>, in the 2023 class, his route to potential QB1 in the 2026 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/\">NFL Draft</a> has been a road less traveled in modern times.</p></div><p>Moore started his career at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UCLA/ucla-bruins/\">UCLA</a>, where he started five games as a true freshman under Chip Kelly. With Kelly on the way out after that season, Moore entered the transfer portal.</p><p>Instead of seeking a guaranteed starting job, Moore opted for the Ducks, who already had lured <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121534/dillon-gabriel/\">Dillon Gabriel</a> away from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OKLA/oklahoma-sooners/\">Oklahoma</a> to be their starter. It was a path reminiscent of the one <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180829/kyler-murray/\">Kyler Murray</a> took. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ARI/arizona-cardinals/\">Arizona Cardinals</a> quarterback was a freshman starter himself at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TXAM/texas-am-aggies/\">Texas A&M</a>, but after that season opted to transfer to Oklahoma despite <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2080032/baker-mayfield/\">Baker Mayfield</a> being the established starter. After two seasons on the bench, Murray's game was transformed, as he became the best quarterback in the country and the No. 1 overall pick in the 2019 NFL Draft.</p><p>The year off served Moore similarly well, as he's developed into a completely different quarterback than the last time we saw him. The scintillating arm talent and athleticism are obviously still there, but Moore's newfound unflappability in the pocket has been eye-opening. He's averaging a ridiculous 8.8 yards per attempt when under pressure this season with no interceptions and has the second-lowest pressure-to-sack conversion rate in the country (3.2%). From an evaluation perspective, that's the holy grail.</p>\n<p>As I stated before, that sort of calm only comes with mastery, and it's clear on tape that Moore's mechanics are elite already. Whether it's his easy, repeatable motion or crisp footwork, Moore's dedication to his craft is evident. The rep below illustrates what I'm talking about beautifully. He gets his feet lined up at the top of his drop to throw the over, stops mid-motion when he realizes the linebacker has jumped it, and immediately resets into perfect alignment to throw the dig coming behind it.</p><div><p>It's like Tiger Woods stopping mid-swing when a phone goes off -- he makes it look easy, but it is not easy. There are starting quarterbacks in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> who can't do what Moore did above without getting skittish feet. And that was in Week 1.  </p><p> I want to reiterate that we're only five games into the season. There are still numerous tests Moore needs to pass before the first round is even a possibility, including No. 8 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/IND/indiana-hoosiers/\">Indiana</a> in a couple weeks, as well as a likely Big Ten Championship Game and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">College Football</a> Playoff run.</p></div><p>In those five games, though, he's given very little reason to be concerned about him passing those tests. And he's absolutely flashed No. 1 overall pick-level of physical ability.</p>\n<p>Watching how easily he pushes the ball downfield, Moore can't help but conjure up images for me of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3123337/jayden-daniels/\">Jayden Daniels</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/LSU/lsu-tigers/\">LSU</a>. With seemingly little effort, the ball explodes out of his hand 50-plus yards downfield.</p>\n<div><p>That's how you want a top pick at quarterback to spin it. That's an athlete who could have excelled at a lot of different sports, but decided to focus on quarterbacking. That's someone who can be developed even further at the next level. </p><p> Of course, the rush to crown someone as the \"next big thing\" in today's immediate gratification age has resulted in some embarrassing whiffs on prospects. No one is crowning Moore just yet, as evidenced by his +700 odds to go No. 1 overall, per <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\">DraftKings Sportsbook</a></span>.</p></div><p>Rather, so few of the top quarterbacks have played impressive enough ball to even be considered with the No. 1 overall pick by season's end. Indiana's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28916321/fernando-mendoza/\">Fernando Mendoza</a> is one. Oklahoma's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28915380/john-mateer/\">John Mateer</a> was another before his injury. After that, Moore might be the only other. </p>\n<p>And if he improves upon what we've seen from him through five weeks this season and doesn't have any regression games, he'd be my pick.</p><h3>2026 NFL Draft No. 1 pick odds</h3><table> <thead><tr><th>Player</th><th>School</th><th>Odds</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>LaNorris Sellers</td><td>South Carolina</td><td>+300</td></tr><tr><td>Garrett Nussmeier</td><td>LSU</td><td>+360</td></tr><tr><td>Fernando Mendoza</td><td>Indiana</td><td>+500</td></tr><tr><td>Drew Allar</td><td>Penn State</td><td>+600</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Dante Moore</strong></td><td><strong>Oregon</strong></td><td><strong>+700</strong></td></tr><tr><td>John Mateer</td><td>Oklahoma</td><td>+1000</td></tr></tbody></table><p><em>Bet college football with </em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\"><em>DraftKings</em></a><em>, where new users get $200 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager. </em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&c=sport&sid=33b2ebe4-4ff7-4bfc-859f-6050cfeb9a2d--fae6\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Click here to get started</em></a>.</p><h2>Dante Moore <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/\">NFL Draft</a> profile</h2>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/prospect-rankings/\" target=\"_blank\">CBS prospect ranking</a>: No. 6 overall (No. 2 WR)</h3><p><strong>Consensus big board ranking (<a href=\"https://www.nflmockdraftdatabase.com/big-boards/2026/consensus-big-board-2026\" target=\"_blank\">via NFL Mock Draft Database</a>)</strong>: No. 7 overall (No. 4 QB)</p>\n<p><em>To check out all of CBSSports.com's most recent mock drafts, </em><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/mock-draft/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>click here</em></a><em>.</em></p><h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> comparison: Deshaun Watson</h3><p>There's no great one-to-one comp for Moore's skillset. Aesthetically, he reminds me of Jayden Daniels, but he's nowhere near the same level of athlete. From a play style perspective, early-career Deshaun Watson makes a lot of sense. Moore is a playmaker with both his arm and legs who exudes confidence with his play style. That was how Watson handled the position coming out of Clemson before the wheels fell off.</p><p><strong>Strengths</strong></p><ul><li>Smooth athlete who can create with his legs</li><li>Effortless throwing motion that's accurate to all levels</li><li>Uncoachably calm under pressure</li></ul><p><strong>Weaknesses</strong></p><ul><li>Limited experience with under 500 career dropbacks</li><li>Underneath heavy offense doesn't put a lot on his plate</li><li>Trim frame that still needs to add muscle</li></ul><h3>What scouts are saying about Dante Moore</h3><p>\"NFL front office staffers had started to bring Dante up even before the Penn State game as someone whose play through the early part of the year wasn't going unnoticed and as someone who was already starting to put himself on the NFL radar, even as a redshirt sophomore. </p><p>\"At that point, one assistant general manager said he was on the radar more \"for moving forward\" as opposed to being a clear guy for next year's draft, but it sounds like that performance against Penn State has NFL scouts and front office staffers starting to become intrigued even more by Moore as a possibility for as soon as next year's draft. </p>\n<p>\"It doesn't hurt Moore's draft prospects that people around the NFL personnel world continue to view this as one of the more wide-open quarterback classes in recent memory.\" -- <em>Matt Zenitz (national NFL/national college football senior reporter for CBS Sports)</em></p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/news/nfl-mock-draft-2026-first-round-quarterback-shakeup/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Renner's 2026 NFL mock draft 2.0: Fernando Mendoza stays at QB1; breakout star Dante Moore lands with Steelers</p>\n                <p>\n                    Mike Renner                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Renner's 2026 NFL mock draft 2.0: Fernando Mendoza stays at QB1; breakout star Dante Moore lands with Steelers\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/17/05965467-50b0-4194-b8c5-7982980173c7/thumbnail/270x152/82438777b3a7e7fab79b51070e405608/dante-moore-usatsi.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h3>Dante Moore college stats</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Season</th><th> G</th><th>GS</th><th>Comp</th><th>Att</th><th>Comp%</th><th>Pass yards</th><th>TD</th><th>INT</th><th>Pass yards/Att</th><th>Pass efficiency rating</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>2025 (Oregon)</strong></td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>100 </td><td>134</td><td>74.6%<br /></td><td>1,210 </td><td>14</td><td>1</td><td>9.0<br /></td><td>183.5 </td></tr><tr><td><strong>2024 (Oregon)</strong></td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>87.5%</td><td>49</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>6.1</td><td>139.0</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2023 (UCLA)</strong></td><td>9</td><td>5</td><td>114 </td><td>213 </td><td>53.5% </td><td>1,610 </td><td>11</td><td>0</td><td>7.6</td><td>125.6 </td></tr><tr><td><strong>Career</strong></td><td>19</td><td>10</td><td>221 </td><td>355</td><td>62.3% </td><td> 2,869\t\t<br /></td><td>25 <br /></td><td>10</td><td>8.1 </td><td>147.7</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Dante Moore 247Sports profile</h3><p><strong>High school:</strong> Martin Luther King (Detroit)<br /><strong>Class:</strong> 2023<br /><strong>Rating: </strong>⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (100)</p><ul><li><strong>National: </strong>4<strong> | QB:</strong> 3 | <strong>Michigan:</strong> 1</li></ul><p><em>Check out Dante Moore's full 247Sports profile, <a href=\"https://247sports.com/player/dante-moore-46084709/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</em></p>\n            </div>",

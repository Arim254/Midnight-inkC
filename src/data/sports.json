    "body": "\nBoth teams need a victory in NFL Week 16 when the Detroit Lions host the Pittsburgh Steelers with both teams entering Sunday at 8-6 and in danger of missing the playoffs. The Steelers are in a good position, sitting a game ahead of the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC North, but they likely need to hold that spot to make the postseason. The Lions are unlikely to win their division as they are two games behind the Chicago Bears (10-4) in the NFC North and 1.5 behind the 9-4-1 Green Bay Packers, who are second in the division and hold the final playoff spot.   Kickoff from Ford Field is set for 4:25 p.m. ET on CBS and Paramount+. The Lions are 7-point favorites in the latest Steelers vs. Lions odds at DraftKings, and the over/under for total points scored is 52. The Lions are -370 money line favorites (risk $370 to win $100), while the Steelers are +295 underdogs. Before you make any Lions vs. Steelers picks of your own, make sure to look at the top NFL picks from the SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times. \nWhere to watch Steelers vs. Lions on SundayWhen: Sunday, Dec. 21Time: 4:25 p.m. ETTV: CBSStream: Paramount+  Follow along: CBS Sports AppSteelers vs. Lions betting previewOdds: Lions -7, Over/Under 52Both teams are 7-7 against the spread, but Pittsburgh has covered in consecutive games and is 6-3 ATS in its past nine in December. Detroit is 10-2 in its past 12 against AFC teams. The Lions have the league's highest-scoring offense (30.6 points per game), which is why they are 9-5 to the Over, including 6-1 in their past seven. Pittsburgh is 7-7 but has scored at least 27 points in four of its past five games. The Detroit defense gives up 24.6 points per game (23rd in NFL) and Pittsburgh gives up an average of 25.4 on the road. Steelers vs. Lions SGPLions -7Jahmyr Gibbs Over 74.5 rushing yardsJared Goff Over 263.5 passing yards Bet it at DraftKings:\nModel's Steelers vs. Lions score prediction, picksThe model sees some value in taking the Steelers as plus-money underdogs on the money line, as they are winning in 35% of simulations. Detroit is covering the spread 52% of the time, and the simulations peg the score right on the number. The props model is expecting a big day for the Lions' offensive players, with Goff predicted to throw for 304 yards and Gibbs to rush for almost 91. Goff is averaging 262 yards per game but has topped this total in three of the past four and had a season-high 338 last week. Gibbs entered NFL Week 16 sixth in the NFL in yards from scrimmage and is averaging 5.5 yards per carry. He has five runs of at least 42 yards this season, so one big run could get him halfway there.Steelers vs. Lions score prediction: Lions 30, Steelers 22\nWant more Week 16 NFL picks?You've seen the model's best bets for Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Detroit Lions.

Both players figure into several NFL player props or a Sunday Night Football SGP, in a contest in which Baltimore is favored by three points.Maye has played at an MVP-type level for a good portion of the season, completing 70.9% of his passes for 3,567 yards and 23 touchdowns. Jackson, meanwhile, has completed 63.5% of his passes for 2,210 yards and 18 touchdowns. There are several NFL player props one could target for these stars, or you may find value in seeking NFL prop lines for other options like TreVeyon Henderson, Rhamondre Stevenson and Stefon Diggs of the Patriots, and Derrick Henry, Zay Flowers and Mark Andrews of the Ravens.

Both schools vastly underperformed this year but had strong finishes, with each finishing the season 3-1 ATS. However, Dabo Swinney has lost four of his last six bowl games, with each defeat coming by at least 14 points. This year, his Tigers are averaging 28.7 points, which ranks 61st in the nation, while Penn State, despite playing in the much tougher Big Ten, ranks 37th nationally in scoring. Also, the location of this game in New York City favors a northeastern university like Penn State over Clemson from South Carolina. The Nittany Lions cover well over 60% of the time, while the model also says the Under hits in almost 60% of simulations. See which other picks the model likes here.\nAnother prediction: Missouri (-4.5, 44.5) covers versus No. 20 Virginia in the Gator Bowl on Dec. 27 in almost 60% of simulations. UVA is coming off an ACC Title Game loss to Duke, in which the Cavaliers would have made the CFP if they had won. Thus, you have to wonder about motivation now that they have to settle for a lesser bowl game, and Virginia has struggled in bowls to begin with, going 1-4 over the last 19 years. Mizzou has won back-to-back bowls under Eli Drinkwitz, and the Tigers' only losses this season came versus teams ranked in the top 10 of the AP Poll at the time. Missouri is 4-1 ATS at neutral sites since Drinkwitz took over in 2020, and the Tigers are 12-4 ATS as favorites since the start of last season. See the rest of the model's picks here.How to make college football picks for bowl seasonThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every 2025-26 college football bowl game, and it's calling for five underdogs to outright win in bowl matchups of power conference teams. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine, and for a limited time you can use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1.So what college football picks can you make with confidence, and which five underdogs are projected to win outright?

    "body": "\n        Several 2025-26 college football bowl games and one playoff matchup are in the books, but bowl confidence pools remain open for entries or modifications as there are more than 30 matchups remaining to make college football bowl picks on this season. The biggest remaining college football spread has Utah as 16.5-point favorites over Nebraska in the Las Vegas Bowl on Wednesday, Dec. 31. While putting faith in big favorites is a part of just about everyone's college football bowl confidence strategy, correctly predicting a couple upsets can give you a big edge in any football pools. Anticipated matchups outside of the CFP include Penn State vs. Clemson (-3.5), Vanderbilt (-5.5) vs. Iowa, Georgia Tech vs. BYU (-4.5), Tennessee vs. Illinois (+2.5) and Michigan vs. Texas (-7.5). Before making any college football predictions for bowl season, be sure to see the latest college football bowl confidence picks from SportsLine's proven model.New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $75 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times, and it is profitable on its top-rated money-line picks since the beginning of the 2024 season.  Anybody following its college football betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now, it has turned its attention to the latest college football odds and 2025-26 bowl season college football betting for confidence pools. Head here to see every pick. New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Top 2025-26 college football bowl confidence picks  One of the model's most confident picks is that No. 16 USC (-6.5), who will have quarterback Jayden Maiava, gets a comfortable win over TCU in the Alamo Bowl on Dec. 30. USC went 9-3 in the regular season, with all three defeats coming versus ranked teams. TCU found itself in the Top 25 once -- back in September -- before having a pedestrian run through the Big 12 schedule, finishing 5-4. Even with the Horned Frogs playing in the easier conference than the Trojans, USC both averaged more points and allowed fewer points per game. USC sports a 32-9 (78%) straight-up record when favored since Lincoln Riley came aboard in 2022, as it is projected to easily take care of business in San Antonio. SportsLine's model has the Trojans prevailing 70% of the time. See all of the model's college football bowl confidence picks here.Another one of the bowl confidence predictions the model is high on: Northwestern (-10.5) handles Central Michigan in the GameAbove Sports Bowl on Dec. 26. Central Michigan struggled mightily against Power 4 opponents this year, losing 63-3 to Michigan and 45-17 to Pittsburgh. Northwestern went just 6-6 this year, but that was largely thanks to a very tough Big Ten schedule that included Oregon, Michigan, USC and Illinois. For comparison, Northwestern lost to Michigan by two points on a last-second field goal. The model has Northwestern winning nearly 80% of the time, making the Wildcats the clear side to back. See the rest of the college football bowl confidence predictions here. How to make college football bowl confidence picksThe model has also made the call on who wins every other bowl game. There are 11 teams that win at least 70% of the time, so you need to go big on those matchups, as well as 15 underdogs that win outright. You can get all the model's picks at SportsLine.So who wins every college football bowl game, and which matchups should you assign the most confidence points to?

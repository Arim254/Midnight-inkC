One of SportsLine's top experts has locked in a pick on Michigan vs. Michigan State to feature in Friday best bets at bet365.Friday also features a nine-game NBA slate, and the SportsLine proven computer model has picked out a pair of NBA best bets, backing the Toronto Raptors to upset the Orlando Magic at +105 odds and the Denver Nuggets to cover as 6.5-point underdogs against the Los Angeles Clippers. Claim the latest bet365 bonus code here:Check out our bet365 promo code review for full details.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every NBA game 10,000 times and has returned well over $10,000 in betting profit for $100 players on its top-rated NBA picks over the past eight-plus seasons.

Bet it at bet365 here:Raptors (+105) to defeat the Magic\nThe Raptors had their four-game winning streak snapped in a 119-92 loss to the Knicks on Wednesday, but the Knicks are one of the favorites to win the Eastern Conference and are tied for the second-best record in the conference, so that's certainly not a bad loss. The game before, the Raptors defeated the Thunder, 103-101, on the road, proving they have the talent to knock off any team in the league. A recent win in Oklahoma City means a trip to Orlando shouldn't intimidate the Raptors, who are 29-20 this season. The Magic (24-22) are coming off a 133-124 win over the Heat on Wednesday, but they lost four straight before that contest. The Raptors have won four straight games against Orlando, including a 107-106 win in December. The model projects Toronto win in 64% of simulations, showcasing strong value at plus-money odds. Back the Raptors at bet365 here:Michigan State (+1) vs. Michigan (-110)\"Both of these teams enter their first of two regular season rivalry showdowns coming off sweaty mid-week wins, with Michigan snatching victory from Nebraska and Sparty having to roar back from a potential upset spot against Rutgers,\" SportsLine expert Chip Patterson said. \"But while Michigan State might have been caught in a lookahead spot, I think Michigan's close win is more in line with its recent form. The Wolverines have failed to cover in each of their last seven games, and there are some matchup points that will allow Michigan State to negate some of what has made Michigan so excellent this season. Plus, Tom Izzo at home as an underdog in a rivalry game? I'll take those points all day.\" Back Michigan State at bet365 here:Nuggets (+6.5) vs. Clippers (-115)The Nuggets play the second half of a back-to-back following a 107-103 victory over the Nets, which could signal multiple players sitting out Friday given the amount of injuries currently facing Denver. However, the Nuggets retain homecourt advantage for Friday, and they are 13-9 in Denver this season. The Clippers aren't at full health either, including Kawhi Leonard (knee) as questionable. The Clippers are on a roll, winning nine of their last 10 games, but six of those wins came against losing teams. Even with Denver's injury situation, which has featured Nikola Jokic (knee) out for weeks, only the Thunder and Pistons have more wins than the Nuggets this season. Denver enters at 32-16 and the Clippers are 22-24. The model projects the Nuggets to cover in 59% of simulations. Back the Nuggets at bet365 here:\nLooking for NBA and college basketball picks?You've seen the model's best bets for Friday.

    "body": "\n        Friday features a nine-game NBA slate with plenty of NBA player props to consider. Kings forward Domantas Sabonis has been a popular option for NBA props over the last few years, given his ability to generate points, rebounds and assists. Sabonis had a tough task with Joel Embiid last night, but with a matchup against the Celtics on Friday, the SportsLine Projection Model projects a stronger showing for the 29-year-old versatile threat.

He averaged 11.3 points per game over those contests, and the 22-year-old is averaging 15.8 ppg this season. The Magic play the Raptors, who are sixth in the league in scoring defense at 112.1 ppg allowed. Black has elevated his game after averaging 4.6 and 9.4 points over his first two seasons, but the model still views this as too high a number against Toronto. The model projects Black for 13.5 points on Friday. DraftKings offers the best odds, while other sportsbooks have him priced at -125 odds or shorter or have moved his over/under down to 15.5 points. Bet on Black with the latest DraftKings promo code, which gives new users $300 in bonus bets if their first $5 wager wins:Deni Avdija, Trail Blazers, Under 22.5 points (-105)He's gone Under this number in back-to-back games, including scoring 17 points over 31 minutes against the Wizards on Tuesday, and Washington has one of the worst defenses in the NBA. Avdija and the Trail Blazers have a significantly tougher matchup on Friday against the Knicks, who are eighth in scoring defense at 112.8 ppg allowed this season. The Knicks have held their opponents to fewer than 95 points in three of their last four games, which is a key reason why the model has the Portland forward projected for 20.8 points on Friday. Avdija has been battling a lower-back strain in recent weeks, but the only games he's missed over the last two weeks have involved back-to-backs, which increases his chances of playing on Friday. But the injury could limit his scoring. \nBet on Avdija with the latest DraftKings promo code, which gives new users $300 in bonus bets if their first $5 wager wins:Domantas Sabonis, Kings, Over 28.5 points + rebounds + assists (-124)Sabonis has gone Over this number in two of his last four games, while having a PRA of at least 24 in each of the last four contests to consistently finish Over to near this mark. He's been one of the most versatile offensive players in the league, averaging at least 19 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists in each of his first three full seasons with the Kings. Even while battling injuries this season, he's still averaging a PRA total of 30.8 heading into a matchup against a Celtics team likely without Jaylen Brown (doubtful, hamstring/knee). The model projects a 32.1 PRA total for Sabonis on Friday. Bet on Sabonis with the latest Caesars Sportsbook promo code CBSSPORTS250BM for a first bet match up to a $250 bonus bet whether your bet wins or loses for new users: \nWant more Friday NBA picks?You've seen the model's NBA picks for some popular NBA player props for Friday.

    "body": "\n        Lindsey Vonn's preparations for the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics took a troubling turn Friday when the American star crashed during the final World Cup downhill before the Games and was airlifted from the course for medical evaluation with a left knee injury.Vonn, 41, lost control after landing a jump on the upper portion of the course in Crans-Montana, Switzerland, spinning into the safety netting amid snowfall and low visibility. She was the sixth skier to start in the race, which had already seen multiple crashes before her run.\nAfter receiving medical attention on the slope, Vonn was able to stand and slowly ski down to the finish area, but she was favoring her left knee and using her poles for support. She stopped several times on the descent and appeared in visible discomfort. The race was later canceled following the series of crashes.Vonn's status for the Olympics is unclear and she said she will undergo further exams on her knee.\n\"I crashed today in the downhill race in Switzerland and injured my left knee,\" Vonn wrote on Instagram. \"I am discussing the situation with my doctors and team and will continue to undergo further exams. This is a very difficult outcome one week before the Olympics, but if there's one thing I know how to do, it's a comeback. My Olympic dream is not over. Thank you for all of the love and support. I will give more information when I have it. Thank you to all the medical staff who helped me today. I am grateful for all the incredible help I received.\"At the bottom of the course, Vonn embraced teammate Jacqueline Wiles before limping into a medical tent. She was then airlifted by helicopter from the venue, a common procedure at mountain races, with the U.S. Ski Team confirming on social media that Vonn was being evaluated.\"She has some pain so it's better to have some checks,\" Aksel Lund Svindal, the two-time Olympic champion who is part of Vonn's coaching team, told Reuters. \"The physio did some checks, they seemed OK, but there were things he was not 100% sure so it was good to have it checked (at the hospital).\"The crash comes exactly one week before the opening ceremony of the Milan Cortina Games, where Vonn is expected to be one of the sport's biggest stars. Her first scheduled Olympic event is the women's downhill two days after the ceremony, with plans to also compete in super-G and the team combined event.Vonn's comeback has been one of the most remarkable stories in skiing. After retiring in 2019 due to the physical toll of repeated injuries, she returned to competition following a partial right knee replacement in April 2024. Now skiing with a titanium implant, she has dominated the downhill circuit this season with two wins and podium finishes in every race, leading the discipline standings.\nCortina d'Ampezzo, the Olympic venue for women's alpine skiing, is also one of Vonn's most successful stops, where she earned 12 of her 84 career World Cup victories.Friday's crash, however, adds uncertainty to her Olympic outlook. Vonn has endured major injuries before, including a devastating knee injury at the 2013 world championships that forced her to miss the 2014 Sochi Olympics.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 Australian Open appeared set to be an all-chalk tournament, as the top four seeds all made it to the semifinals, with No. 1 Carlos Alcaraz and No. 2 Jannik Sinner looking destined to meet in the final for the fourth consecutive grand slam. However, both were pushed to the brink on Friday in Melbourne, as No. 3 Alexander Zverev pushed Alcaraz in a five-set thriller 6-4, 7-6 (5), 6-7 (3), 6-7 (4), 7-5, while No. 4 Novak Djokovic shocked Sinner (3-6, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4) in an instant classic at Rod Laver Arena.Djokovic's triumph was the most notable, and statistically he should've been overwhelmed by the defending Aussie Open champ. Nothing about the match's box score suggests Djokovic should have won, as Sinner won more points (152 to 140), hit more winners (72 to 40) and more aces (26 to 12) and was even in unforced errors (42 to 42). However, the wily 38-year-old veteran did what he's done so many times over his career, dragging the match out into deep water and frustrating Sinner by forcing him deep into points and making it impossible for the Italian to ever fully take control.\nThat was most notable on the Djokovic serve, where he was able to dig deep and come up with his best when his back was against the wall. Sinner won just 2 of 18 break point opportunities against Djokovic in the match, as the veteran continually found shots when he had to have them to stay on serve.On the other side, Sinner only yielded eight break opportunities throughout the match, but Djokovic seized those chances to win three of them, which was just enough to get over the line. For Sinner, it snaps a streak of five consecutive trips to a grand slam final, while Djokovic now stands on the precipice of history as he seeks an 11th Australian Open title and 25th career grand slam title. To get there, he'll have to beat the other young star at the top of the men's tennis world. \nAlcaraz outlasts Zverev in five-hour marathonAlcaraz needed five hours and 27 minutes to dispatch Zverev in his semifinal in a match where break points were also at a premium. Zverev only broke the Alcaraz serve twice (on seven break point chances), but the German was excellent on his serve and was able to fight back after Alcaraz jumped out to a 2-0 lead after the first two sets. The second, third and fourth sets all went to tiebreakers, with Zverev's serving prowess winning him the third and fourth in those tiebreaks. However, in the fifth set, Alcaraz's unbelievable stamina showed itself in the biggest moment of the match, pouncing on a break chance to win at 6-5 by coming up with a stunning forehand on the run to force an error from Zverev at the net. \nIt was a perfect Alcaraz ending, producing a magical shot just when it seemed his opponent had him on the ropes, and now he heads to his first-ever Australian Open final. \nHistoric Australian Open final setSunday's final will be the six-time grand slam champ against the 24-time champ, with both coming out of grueling five-set matches that asked everything of both men. One would think that would benefit the younger Alcaraz, but given the way Djokovic has been dodging raindrops this tournament, the young Spaniard will need to bring his A-game and try to put Djokovic in a deep hole early. If he allows the Serbian star to hang around, he might find himself in the same position as Sinner, wondering how Djokovic ended up triumphant. If Alcaraz is successful on Sunday, he'll become the youngest man to ever complete the career grand slam and the first man to win seven grand slam titles before the age of 23. Djokovic, meanwhile, would become the second oldest grand slam champion in history at 38 years old -- and would be the oldest in the Open Era. A 25th title for the Joker would also make him the winningest player in grand slam history, men's or women's, breaking his tie with Margaret Court. \nIf that match is anything close to what we saw in the semifinals, it'll be an all-timer in Melbourne. We'll have to see how both men recover from a pair of mentally and physically draining matches, but given both have built their careers out of incredible stamina, one would expect them to tap deep into their reserves to find an elite level again for Sunday. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        It's separation season in college basketball. Pretender or contender status will be earned this weekend with numerous titans set to square off in matchups that could shift the calculus on Selection Sunday in a major way. Friday's Michigan-Michigan State rivalry clash features two teams on pace for top-three seeds. Sunday's battle between Illinois and Nebraska features two squads that are eyeing a potential No. 1 seed. Oh, and Sunday's Florida-Alabama matchup will go a long way in determining who is the cream of the crop in the SEC, and the chance to earn a top-four seed and wear home uniforms for the first two rounds of the NCAA Tournament.Let's dive into this weekend's top storylines, bracketology version.Check out the full field of 68 at the CBS Sports Bracketology hub.Can anyone else join the Big 12's 'Stellar Six'?Arizona, Iowa State, Houston, BYU, Kansas and Texas Tech are going to make the Big Dance, barring something catastrophic down the stretch. All of the Big 12 titans are tracking for a top-five seed. That's the good news.The bad news is that ninth-seeded UCF is the only other Big 12 team in the field of 68 today. The Knights cruised to an 11-1 non-conference record, but they have predictably shown a bit more cracks in the armor in Big 12 play, taking losses to Oklahoma State, Arizona and Iowa State. The next 10 days will be illuminating for UCF's resume. \nSaturday's home test against Texas Tech is a war. Good luck and best wishes beating Houston on the road on Wednesday. Oh, and then next Sunday features a road trip to Cincinnati. Win two out of three and UCF's on sturdy ground for an at-large berth. Lose a couple, and the Big 12 could be staring down the reality that just six of the 16 teams in the league are NCAA Tournament caliber. The top of the Big 12 is the best in America, but getting 38% of its teams in the Big Dance would be the lowest percentage for the league since 2007.Road warriors?Road wins are like gold for Wins Above Bubble (WAB), a second-year metric the NCAA Tournament seeding committee is using to weigh resumes against what the average bubble team would do with the same slate. Margin of victory is irrelevant for WAB, but where you win is vital. The most impressive win so far, for WAB purposes, this year is Wisconsin going into Ann Arbor and knocking off Michigan. The list of WAB's most-outstanding wins is littered with neutral-site or true road victories.\nThat raises the stakes for teams currently close to the bubble.Indiana is currently a No. 10 seed, but it can buff up its resume in a major way if it can beat UCLA on the road on Saturday. Knocking off the Bruins would earn IU +0.70 WAB, equaling the mark it earned for beating Purdue at home this week. Ohio State is in a similar boat. The Buckeyes are currently a No. 10 seed. They don't have much wiggle room, but a road win over Wisconsin would earn OSU approximately +0.72 WAB. That would be the best win of the season for Jake Diebler's group and catapult Ohio State approximately 10 spots higher in WAB from 43rd to nearly top-30 status. A loss would knock Ohio State out of the projected tournament picture, per CBS Sports' algorithm. Road wins are a salve to escape the falling knife that is the bubble in a jiffy. \nRoad games for Texas (at Oklahoma), Kentucky (at Arkansas), SMU (at Louisville) and San Diego State (at Utah State) will also be notable in the chase for at-large bids. The Longhorns are among CBS Sports' first four teams out of the field and San Diego State, a current No. 11 seed, is not too far ahead in the first four. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NFL has publicly responded to the growing theory that an electrical substation near the San Francisco 49ers' practice facility is contributing to the team's recent spike in injuries. And while the league stopped short of issuing an absolute dismissal, its medical leadership made clear there is no scientific evidence supporting the claim.The topic, which originated on social media and spread rapidly following another injury-heavy season for the 49ers, was raised Friday during an NFL player health and safety media briefing. There, NFL Chief Medical Officer Dr. Allen Sills addressed the speculation directly.\"I'm not familiar with anything in the sports medicine literature that supports those associations,\" Sills said. \"But I would also tell you that injury causation is really complex. If you think about biology and medicine, you don't have usually one single factor that drives biological systems.\"Sills emphasized that football injuries are influenced by multiple overlapping factors -- including training methods, player history, equipment, exposure levels and style of play -- rather than any single environmental cause.\n\"So we try to be transparent, but we try to be comprehensive, and I would just caution again against drawing any conclusions based on publicly-available data sources,\" Sills said. \"One of the things that's been said is that that club has led the league in non-direct contact lower extremity injuries. That's simply not true. That's false. So I think we have obviously a lot of work to do on all these injuries and we'll consider any and all mechanisms, but that's sort of the broader picture on that particular question.\"\n        \n            \n                49ers to investigate viral substation conspiracy theory as team searches for answers to alarming injury rate\n                \n                    Bryan DeArdo                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe theory centers on the proximity of the 49ers' training facility to an electrical substation operated by Silicon Valley Power near Levi's Stadium. The idea gained mainstream attention after a viral post claimed electromagnetic field exposure could be linked to non-contact lower-body injuries, a claim that has been widely challenged by scientists and medical professionals.Despite the lack of scientific support, the 49ers are not ignoring the conversation.\nGeneral manager John Lynch confirmed last week the organization will review the theory as part of a broader offseason evaluation of player health, training systems and injury mitigation strategies. The substation expanded in 2014 alongside the opening of Levi's Stadium, but the team has practiced at the same site since 1988 -- a detail many experts cite as evidence against any recent environmental link.Still, the theory has circulated within the locker room.\"It's definitely been a talking point for years,\" 49ers fullback Kyle Juszczyk said in an interview with Front Office Sports. \"It's one of those things that it's just so hard to say because the science is not clear behind it. And I'm very much a science-driven person. And I want to see the numbers and the statistics.\"The 49ers endured major injuries in 2025 to several cornerstone players, including Nick Bosa, George Kittle, Brock Purdy, Fred Warner and Mykel Williams, continuing a trend that has plagued the franchise in recent years. Despite finishing 12-5 in one of the NFL's toughest divisions, health -- not talent -- remains the team's biggest obstacle to sustained postseason success.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        In what would be a league first, the NFL is open to discussing throwing flags on the field following video review for plays related to player health and safety.Dawn Aponte, the NFL's chief football administrative officer for football operations, revealed Friday the league is amenable to those discussions this offseason with the competition committee, with a potential rule change coming this spring for the 2026 regular season.Plays like facemask, unnecessary roughness, roughing the passer, use of helmet and hip-drop tackles could all be subject to flags being thrown after video review. As of now, replay assist can only adjudicate whether a flag already on the field should have been thrown.As technology has advanced over the years, the NFL has remained steadfast in its stance that the game is officiated by humans on the football field. The league has enhanced its replay review and replay assist, and coaches have more freedom today than ever in challenging calls on the field.\nThe concern is multifold, but it consists of two main tenets. First, a flag could be thrown on nearly every play. To review any given play with the possibility of placing a flag on the field is untenable. Second, players, coaches and fans all have to believe in the integrity of the game. Officials on the field are responsible for officiating -- not the eye in the sky or league officials huddled in New York.That is why the league could try this on player safety fouls rather than high-leverage, highly subjective calls like defensive pass interference, which was a disaster in the 2019 season.Something (mostly) objective like a facemask should be able to be flagged with the help of video assistance, one may argue. An official's eyes may have missed unnecessary roughness while officiating a different part of the play, and video can only help in that regard.\nAnd then there's the hip-drop tackle, one of the most injurious plays in the league that the NFL has tried to eradicate from the game. Since creating a multi-step rule prohibiting the play ahead of the 2024 season, the NFL has fined players about 30 times each year. But there have been only three total flags on the field.The league heard from teams that wish the tackle, which can end a player's season with a lower-extremity injury, would be punished in real time rather than with a fine a week later. Allowing potential hip-drop tackles to be reviewed on video would surely result in more penalties on the field.It would be a brave new step for the NFL to institute such a rule change. The competition committee will meet in Indianapolis at the NFL Scouting Combine to discuss potential changes, and any rules proposal would then go to a vote among the 32 clubs at the annual meetings in late March.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Cooper Flagg and Kon Knueppel put on a show Thursday night when the former Duke teammates faced off for the first time in their professional careers. Knueppel had the last laugh as his Charlotte Hornets beat the Dallas Mavericks 123-121. Knueppel dropped 34 points on 62.5% from the floor in the win but Flagg's individual effort was historic. The 19-year-old scored 49 points on 20 of 29 from the field, setting an NBA record for most points scored in a game by a teenager and breaking the Mavericks' single-game rookie scoring record.The duel between the star rookies was as advertised, as Knueppel caught fire from 3-point range while Flagg was the Mavericks' offensive engine. Their 83 points combined was the third-most by a rookie duo in NBA history, trailing only Pete Maravich (Atlanta) and Nate Archibald (Cincinnati) in 1971 (91 points) and Johnny Green (New York) and Wilt Chamberlain (Philadelphia) in 1960 (85 points).\nThursday night's game served as the latest entry for both players' Rookie of the Year case, and as impressive as Knueppel was, and has been over the course of the season, Flagg's got the slight edge here for the award. Make no mistake, Knueppel, 20, has all the makings of being a future star in this league. It's not just his 3-point shooting, he's shown a willingness and ability to attack the rim when given the opportunity. His off-ball movement is already years beyond his age, and he makes the right passes to get a higher percentage shot.But Knueppel is also playing on a team where he's not the central focus offensively. He has the luxury of playing next to LaMelo Ball, who attracts so much defensive attention that it often opens up wide-open looks for Knueppel on the perimeter. That was on display Thursday night, as 24 of Knueppel's 34 points came off 3s, where Miles Bridges and Ball combined for nine assists to Knueppel, who was automatic from long range.\nMeanwhile, Flagg was fighting through contact for points and working in a variety of floaters, mid-range pull ups and 3s to give his injury-riddled team a chance. He was creating for himself while dealing with far more defensive pressure whenever he touched the ball. Flagg was the only Mavericks starter who finished the game with a positive plus-minus, and given he was the only Dallas player who crossed the 20-point threshold, you can see why.\nWith the Mavericks dealing with so many injuries, primarily to Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving, it's allowed Flagg -- the No. 1 pick -- to be more in control of the offense. After a rough first few weeks, Flagg's been as dominant as many expected him to be since. MonthGames playedPPGFG%RPGAPGOctober513.441%6.22.8November1517.847.7%6.73.7December1323.551.6%6.24.8January1119.647.2%6.74.6His production in January took a slight downturn, but the 49 points signaled that this is no case of hitting the rookie wall. He's still averaging nearly 20 points on 48% from the floor, which is a level of efficiency unheard of for rookies. Flagg's shooting that well with nearly 46% of his shots coming from mid-range, a feat typically reserved for only the most lethal shooters in the league.And that's just the offensive side of the ball. Flagg's defense is what will launch him into a class of his own. He has a great feel for timing blocks, can guard multiple positions and already is a solid point-of-attack defender on the perimeter. His size makes him difficult to navigate around, but he's also quick on his feet to not look like a deer in headlights when he gets switched on smaller, shiftier guards.\nThursday night's battle showcased two premier rookies at the top of their game in what could prove to be a compelling Rookie of the Year race. Flagg, now a -500 favorite at DraftKings, has the edge right now, but Knueppel (+340) has a worthy case too with several months to play. \n            ",

    "body": "\nOne tight end is playing in his first Super Bowl, in his 10th season in the NFL. The other tight end is playing in his first Super Bowl, in just his second year.The New England Patriots' 31-year-old team captain Hunter Henry and the Seattle Seahawks' 23-year-old AJ Barner have taken different roads to get to the same point: Super Bowl LX at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif. But both will play significant roles for their team in the biggest game of the year. DraftKings has set Henry's receptions prop at 3.5 and his receiving yards prop at 38.5. Meanwhile Barners' are 2.5 and 25.5. Those are just some of the hundreds of tight end player props available for Super Bowl LX.\nHunter Henry, PatriotsTotal receptions: 3.5 Total receiving yards: 38.5Anytime TD scorer: +225First TD scorer: +1300Most receiving yards: +1000Most receptions: +860Super Bowl MVP: +11000Despite being toward the tail end of his career, Henry is in the midst of arguably his best NFL season. During the regular season, he had 60 catches for 768 yards and seven touchdowns. And in three playoff games, he has six catches for 81 yards and another score despite playing three of the toughest defenses in the NFL and facing weather conditions that weren't conducive to throwing the ball.Henry has gone Over 38.5 receiving yards in 11 of 20 games this season, including six of his last 10 games. During the regular season, he ranked second on the team in targets (87), receptions (60) and receiving yards (768) behind only Stefon Diggs.Best bets: Henry Over 3.5 receptions, Over 38.5 receiving yards\nFew Patriots players have a plus matchup against the Seahawks' No. 1 scoring defense, but Henry certainly does. Because Seattle emphasizes stopping the run and limiting receivers on the outside, tight ends have found success against the Seahawks. The defense is allowing a passer rating of 102.2 when throwing to tight ends, which ranks a rather meh 18th in the league. During the regular season, the unit gave up 8.47 targets per game to tight ends, which was tied for fourth-most in the NFL. And in the last two playoff games, both the 49ers' Jake Tonges (59 receiving yards) and the Rams' Colby Parkinson (62 receiving yards) cleared 38.5 receiving yards easily.AJ Barner, SeahawksTotal receptions: 2.5Total receiving yards: 25.5Anytime TD scorer: +225First TD scorer: +1300Most receiving yards: +2800Most receptions: +1940Super Bowl MVP: +10000Barner's production roughly doubled in his second year in the league, improving to 52 catches for 519 yards and six touchdowns during the regular season. He was second on the team, behind only Jaxon Smith-Njigba, in both receptions and receiving touchdowns.In the Super Bowl, Barner will face a New England defense that has been good at limiting tight ends this season. Behind safeties Jaylinn Hawkins and Craig Woodson, the Patriots allow a passer rating of 98.2 when throwing to tight ends, which ranks 10th in the league.Note: New England opponents were playing from behind a lot this season, and game script certainly skews those numbers. In the second halves this season, the Patriots gave up 3.3 catches to tight ends for 34.5 yards, which ranked 27th and 28th in the league, respectively. So any bettor who believes the Seahawks will be forced to throw in the second half should consider Barner's props.Best bets: Barner Under 2.5 receptions, Under 25.5 receiving yards\nWhile Barner has gone Over 2.5 receptions and 25.5 receiving yards in 10 of 19 games this season, he has gone Under those totals in each of his last three games. Over his last four games, he has had three, three, zero and three targets total. Even in the 31-27 shootout against the Rams in the NFC Championship Game, he had just two catches for 13 yards.A banged-up body could certainly be playing a role. He has been a regular member of the injury report over the last month with knee, shoulder, ankle, elbow and hip injuries. The extra week before the Super Bowl should certainly help, but Under Barner's totals seems to be the right plays.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        We are now inside a week away from the NBA trade deadline and all of the focus remains on the Milwaukee Bucks and what they will do with Giannis Antetokounmpo. Reports indicate the Bucks are now seriously listening to offers on their franchise cornerstone. Antetokounmpo still has not made an official trade request, but has indicated he's \"ready for a new home,\" which is the closest thing to a trade request without actually demanding one. Everything hinges on Antetokounmpo, as we won't see any other big names moved -- like Ja Morant or Anthony Davis -- before there's clarity on Antetokounmpo's availability at the deadline. If the Bucks are serious about engaging in trade talks, plenty of teams will make overtures, but there aren't many that can easily make an offer to meet the Bucks' demands right now. \n        \n            \n                Ranking Giannis Antetokounmpo trade packages: Who can make best deadline offer?\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThat leaves the Bucks in a tricky spot where they'll need to decide whether it's worth dragging this out into the summer when more teams can make stronger offers with regards to draft assets, or if there's a strong enough offer to move Antetokounmpo before Feb. 5. \nThat leads us to the latest rumblings from around the league, which unsurprisingly focuses on Antetokounmpo and the team that figures to push hardest for a trade over the next week. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Why Warriors will be most aggressive Giannis suitorAfter seeing Jimmy Butler's season end with a torn ACL, the Golden State Warriors faced a crisis in trying to salvage this season, which figured to be one of the last chances to contend with Stephen Curry. Now that Antetokounmpo is potentially available, they may be thrown a lifeline, but they will need to finally unload the future picks they've been so loath to trade in the past. Because they have four future first-round picks at their disposal, they are the team with the best chance to make a two-team deal with the Bucks. And as Brian Windhorst laid out on ESPN on Friday, they're the team with the best chance to land Antetokounmpo by next Thursday. \n\"If there is a deal thats going to be done before the deadline, in my belief, Golden State is the team to make that deal,\" Windhorst said. \"Because the other teams have to get third and fourth teams involved, and that is why Golden State is going to probably be the most aggressive between now and Thursday. Their best position is doing the deal before next Thursday.\" Teams like the New York Knicks, Miami Heat and Minnesota Timberwolves lack the volume of tradable draft assets the Warriors have, and the Bucks will be asking for multiple first rounders in return. As Windhorst notes, that means they need to loop in other teams interested in trading first-round picks for some of their players, and any time you have to expand a trade to three or four (or more) teams, the likelihood of a deal actually coming together goes down considerably. Those teams might be better served waiting until this summer before the 2026 NBA Draft, when they'd be eligible to trade their 2026 pick along with their other future picks. That is why Windhorst notes Golden State isn't just the most likely team to make a trade before the deadline, but the team with the most reason to push hard to get it done by Thursday. \nThe Warriors' best offer won't change much this summer, but their top competitors on the market will be able to improve theirs. That means their window to be the clear best option for the Bucks is right now, but they also have to convince Antetokounmpo it's in his best interests to join forces with Curry. We can talk all we want about the best trade packages, but none of it matters if the Warriors aren't high up on Antetokounmpo's wish list. As we've seen numerous times in recent years, the superstar holds plenty of control in these situations. And with Antetokounmpo able to hit free agency after the 2026-27 season, Golden State wouldn't part with their best offer without securing a commitment from Antetokounmpo's camp that he'll sign a long-term extension once able. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Bucks asking 'for the moon' in Giannis trade talksIn related news, while the Bucks are willing to entertain trade talks about Antetokounmpo, they aren't willing to discuss any discounted rates just yet. Because Antetokounmpo has not demanded a trade or even provided the Bucks with a short list of one or two teams he would be interested in, Milwaukee is still operating with plenty of leverage in trade talks and asking teams to pay full price for the 31-year-old star. \n\"They're asking for the moon,\" one general manager told The Stein Line on Thursday morning. \"All of your young players and all of your draft picks.\"That line points to the Bucks understanding this is their one chance at a true reset after spending the past five years exhausting their resources to try and keep Antetokounmpo happy. After initially hitting with the Jrue Holiday deal and winning a title, their acquisitions for Damian Lillard and Myles Turner -- stretching Lillard's salary in what appears to have been an ill-fated decision -- have not gone according to plan. The Bucks desperately need to reload in terms of draft assets and shift toward a youth movement, which is why they have to nail an Antetokounmpo trade. Moving on from a franchise player is never easy and rarely does it result in a quick bounce back, but the Bucks have to lay the foundation for the future with this trade -- and then hit on the resulting draft picks. That's clearly understood in the Milwaukee front office, and it points to why a team like Golden State, with four future firsts at their disposal, would have the best chance at this point to land Antetokounmpo. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Minnesota Twins and president of baseball operations Derek Falvey have mutually agreed to end their relationship, the team announced Friday. Falvey had been executive vice president since October 2016 and was promoted to president of baseball operations in 2019.The team has said that general manager Jeremy Zoll takes over controls of baseball operations, though it sounds like they are open to hiring a new team president.Under Falvey, the Twins won 101 games in 2019 and won the AL Central three times (2019, 2020, 2023). They advanced to the ALDS in 2023, winning their first playoff series since 2002. \"Over the past several weeks, Derek and I had thoughtful and candid conversations about leadership, structure, and the future of the club,\" Twins executive chairman Tom Pohlad said in a statement. \"We reached a shared understanding that the needs of the organization are evolving and that a leadership transition is the best way to move forward.\"I want to thank Derek for everything he has contributed to this organization. When he joined the Twins nine years ago, it was, in many ways, a watershed moment for this franchise. His leadership was transformational. He helped modernize every aspect of our baseball operations and led with strong values, intention, and purpose. ...While we value our foundation, our commitment to building a championship caliber organization requires decisiveness and urgency. We will immediately begin a search for a President of Business Operations who, along with General Manager Jeremy Zoll, will report to me.\" \nAdded Falvey: \"Following a series of thoughtful conversations with Tom that began after the ownership transition and progressed over the past few weeks, we both agreed this was the right time for us to part ways. Ownership transitions naturally create moments for reflection and honest dialogue about leadership, vision, and how an organization wants to move forward. Over the past several weeks we had those conversations openly and constructively and ultimately reached a shared understanding that this was the right step both for the organization and for me personally.\"Following the Twins' ALDS exit in 2023, they went 82-80 in 2024 and then fell all the way down to 70-92 last season, finishing 18 games out of first place. They were one of the bigger sellers in front of the trade deadline during the 2025 season, notably dealing shortstop Carlos Correa, who still has three years and over $95 million left on his deal. Moving forward, the Twins don't look like a strong contender and could end up being a seller again, whether during the season or possibly before Opening Day. They do have a possibly-strong rotation along with a foundation of good position-players like Byron Buxton and Royce Lewis. The Twins initially shut down trade speculation about Buxton and right-hander Joe Ryan in December.\nThis is to say that it'll be interesting to see how the Twins move ahead, as they have several players who would make for very intriguing trade pieces.\n            ",

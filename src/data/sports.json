    "body": "\n        After an abbreviated stop in Hawaii, the 2026 PGA Tour schedule begins the West Coast Swing with The American Express 2026 beginning on Thursday at the Pete Dye Stadium Course in La Quinta, Calif. After skipping the one-week Hawaii Swing, World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler is set to make his debut as part of The American Express 2026 field. The four-time major winner hasn't played particularly well in this event, however, recording just one top-10 finish in five tries. Still, the 2026 American Express odds list Scheffler as the clear-cut +300 favorite (risk $100 to win $300). Ben Griffin, ranked No. 8 in the world, is next on the PGA odds board at +2000, with Robert MacIntyre and Russell Henley at +2200 and Ludvig Aberg at +2500. Patrick Cantlay and Sam Burns are both +2700. Before locking in any 2026 American Express picks, or making any PGA DFS picks on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up over $8,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.This same model has also nailed a whopping 16 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- as well as this year's PGA Championship and Open Championship. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting sites. \nNew users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Now that the 2026 American Express field is locked in, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard. 2026 American Express predictions One major surprise the model is calling for at The American Express 2026: Sam Burns, one of the favorites, stumbles and barely cracks the top 10. He's a golfer to avoid at La Quinta this week. Burns had some highlights in 2025, including finishing T7 at the Tour Championship after a strong playoff run. There were also some low points as well like going nine straight tournaments without a top-20 finish, including three straight missed cuts in that run. He has a pair of top-10 finishes at The American Express, but no top-5s, and he finished T29 last year, so the model doesn't like him as a top contender this week. See who else to fade here. \nAnother surprise: The model calls Matt Fitzpatrick a top-four contender this week despite being a +3500 longshot. He's a golfer to target if you're looking for a big return. This will be his debut at The American Express, but he finished 2025 strong with four top-10 finishes in his last six events. He finished the season 34th in Strokes Gained: Total and 30th in Strokes Gained: Putting, making him a golfer to target with slightly longer odds this week. See who else to pick here. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:How to make 2026 American Express picksThe model is also targeting three other golfers with odds of +2700 or higher as top-10 contenders. You can only see the model's picks here. \nWho will win the 2026 American Express, and which longshots will stun the golfing world?

    "body": "\n        Scottie Scheffler makes his season debut as the odds-on favorite to win the 2026 PGA American Express Tournament. The world's top-ranked golfer is looking to win his 20th PGA tournament since turning pro in 2018. Scheffler, 29, last won at the Procore Championship last September in Scottsdale,  Ariz. He won by one stroke over fellow American Ben Griffin. This year's event gets underway on Thursday at 11:30 a.m. ET from La Quinta Country Club in La Quinta, Calif. The tournament will begin on a par-72 course measuring 7,210 yards. Scheffler is the +280 favorite (risk $100 to win $280) at DraftKings Sportsbook. Other favorites include Ben Griffin at +2000; Sam Burns, Russell Henley, Robert McIntyre and Ludvig Aberg at +2500; and Patrick Cantlay at +3000. Before making any 2026 American Express picks, you need to see the 2026 American Express predictions and best bets from golf expert Brady Kannon. Kannon is an elite golfing handicapper with more than 30 years of experience in the industry. He's hit eight major outright winners since 2013. In the fall of 2022, he hit outright winners in three consecutive weeks: Russell Henley (40-1), Tony Finau (18-1) and Adam Svensson (150-1). Last season, he hit Hideki Matsuyama (22-1), Harris English (110-1), Ludvig Aberg (25-1) and Ben Griffin/Andrew Novak (25-1) in New Orleans. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:\nNow, Kannon has focused his attention on the 2026 American Express field and locked in his best bets and top sleepers. You can only see them here. Top 2026 American Express expert picks One of Kannon's 2026 American Express predictions: He's completely fading Wyndham Clark, who is going off to 80-1. He's avoiding him in outright bets and advises to go against him in head-to-head bets as well.\"Clark did not play in Hawaii and missed the cut in his last regular Tour start back in early November,\" Kannon said. \"He finished 13th here at the Amex in 2022 but otherwise hasn't been better than 39th and missed the cut here last season. He is losing strokes both off the tee and on approach in each of his last five starts. Last season, Clark ranked 154th on Tour in Strokes Gained: Approach and 160th in Driving Accuracy. I also wonder if Clark's feelings of frustration regarding Brooks Koepka's return to the PGA Tour could still be a lingering distraction as he makes his season debut. I did find one head-to-head matchup with Clark as an underdog to J.T. Poston and yes, I would play the favorite against our fade player of the week.\" See who Kannon is backing at SportsLine.\nNew users can also check out the latest bet365 bonus code to get $200 in bonus bets after placing a $5 bet:How to make 2026 American Express picksKannon has revealed his best bet, and it's a surprising golfer going off at nearly 100-1.

    "body": "\n        LSU coach Lane Kiffin previously credited Nick Saban with helping him make the decision to leave Ole Miss and take the LSU job in November, but has now shared details of the conversation he had with the former Alabama coach that led to his choice to head to Baton Rouge.Saban won a national title at LSU before an ill-fated NFL tenure with the Miami Dolphins prior to his legendary career with the Crimson Tide. Saban won six national championships and nine SEC titles over 17 seasons at Alabama from 2007-23.Kiffin served as Saban's offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach from 2014-16, which included a national championship. Alabama fired Kiffin before the 2017 College Football Playoff National Championship Game after he had accepted the Florida Atlantic job and was splitting time for each.\"When [LSU] came in and met with me, it was just different,\" Kiffin said Tuesday. \"The feeling was different and as I sat there and told the story at the press conference, I was torn. When I called Coach Saban and talked it through with him, he said, 'you know, Lane, you'll always regret if you don't go to LSU. It's the best job in America.' And when he said that, it really made the decision for me.\n\"As I've looked at it, it has pushed me. It has got me out of a comfort zone that we were doing amazing things but you come here and feel the power of the place and it drives you every day to even go to another level.\"\nSaban said on College GameDay after Kiffin's departure to LSU that his former play-caller was initially \"confused\" on what he wanted to do.\"I never tell anybody what they should do,\" Saban said on ESPN. \"I just try to bring some thought into it so that they can make good decisions for themselves and their family and their future.\"\nKiffin left the Rebels before the start of the playoff and was not allowed to coach Ole Miss in the postseason after a ruling by athletic director Keith Carter. The Rebels, with new coach Pete Golding (Kiffin's defensive coordinator in Oxford) leading the way, blew out No. 11 Tulane in the first round and upset No. 3 Georgia in the quarterfinals before falling to No. 10 Miami in the CFP semifinals.Kiffin went 55-19 over six seasons at Ole Miss. One of the highest-profile coaches in college football since joining the Rebels in 2020, Kiffin led the program to four 10-win seasons and three finishes of No. 11 or better in the AP Top 25. LSU, meanwhile, fired Brian Kelly after the eighth game of his fourth season on the job, opening the door for its pursuit of Kiffin. Florida also came after Kiffin, but LSU was the more attractive destination. And Saban's advice clearly held weight. \n\"You know, coach Saban kind of coached at another place in this conference, so I can't ... I can't really say exactly what he said, but I'll say I think the world of coach Saban, and I respect him,\" Kiffin said at his introductory press conference in December. \"And so, there's a reason I'm here.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        It's a new era at Stamford Bridge and the Blues have taken a big bet by bringing in English manager Liam Rosenior to lead the club. Only 41, this is a tall task for Rosenior to come from Strasbourg to Chelsea, but history is also in his favor. Chelsea have twice won the Champions League in their history, lifting the trophy in 2012 and 2021. Each time, Chelsea changed their manager midseason and ended up winning the competition. With Rosenior replacing Enzo Maresca, the Blues are looking to secure a top-eight place in the league phase and direct passage to the round of 16 as they host former player David Luiz and Pafos on Wednesday.How to watch Chelsea vs. Pafos oddsDate: Wednesday, Jan. 21 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Stamford Bridge -- LondonLive stream: Paramount+Odds: Chelsea -699; Draw +700; Pafos +1600Plenty is being said about Rosenior's experience, but in European soccer, he brings the same level of experience as Maresca, who led Chelsea to a Europa Conference League title and glory at the Club World Cup. Rosenior was managing Strasbourg in the Conference League this season before taking over the Blues, and despite only managing two matches so far, he was able to keep Chelsea competitive, facing Arsenal in a League Cup defeat before engineering a shutout victory over Brentford. But he's aware that, despite this being the first match that he'll manage in the Champions League, not much changes preparation-wise.\"I'm proud to be here [managing in the Champions League]. Like I've said before, my focus is on winning the game. My focus is on success here, so I'm preparing a game like we would any other game to make sure we put in the best performance to give us a chance of winning the game,\" Rosenior said in his pre-match press conference.A player who has already been key for the new manager is Argentine midfielder Enzo Fernández. He has a goal and two assists in two matches under Rosenior and seems set to be a central figure in what Chelsea will do moving forward, and Rosenior expressed how important Fernandez is to him. That should come as no surprise when Fernandez has been able to move from being a defensive midfielder to being a box-to-box midfielder or operate as a No. 10, all with amazing effectiveness. Along with Declan Rice and Bruno Guimaraes, Fernandez is one of the most well-rounded midfielders in the Premier League and in the world. If he can combine well with Cole Palmer down the stretch, the Blues can absolutely become a dark-horse contender to win this competition. \nRosenior teams have a reputation of being hard to break down defensively, so with his system coming into play, Chelsea just need a set attack that can make things happen. With Fernendez's versatility, they have a leg up. While the Blues will need to prove that they can take down teams like Arsenal in the future, showing that they're competitive now means there is another gear that Rosenior can help them unlock, but it all begins with defeating Pafos on Wednesday. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The more they play, the more it seems to be Arsenal's year. The team coached by Mikel Arteta won 3-1 at San Siro against Inter on Tuesday on Matchday 7 of the Champions League, deploying another incredible performance that underlined once again why they are currently considered the best team around.With seven wins in seven games so far in the league phase of the UEFA Champions League, Arsenal are leading the standings and will likely end up as winners of the opening phase. After winning seven games in a row for the first time in their European history, scoring 20 goals and conceding just two, the Gunners look like the best team in the competition right now and could potentially win their first Premier League title in more than two decades as well. For that reason, it's hard to imagine them finishing the season without lifting at least one trophy in the coming months.\nThe game at San Siro showed, if possible, even more of their potential because of the choices made by Arteta in the starting 11. The Spanish coach decided to bench some of the key players of this team, including English midfielder Declan Rice and Swedish striker Viktor Gyokeres, who came off the bench and scored the goal to make it 3-1 in the second half. While Arteta's selections appeared focused on prioritizing the Premier League, along with the rotations, he is forced to make do with playing every three days, and this game also highlighted the gap between Arsenal and Inter, the 2024–25 Champions League finalists.\nIt's quite obvious that both teams are kind of safe, considering their league phase standings. Arsenal are expected to end up as the winners of the league phase, which means they will play at home all the second games in the round of 16. On the other hand, if Inter don't end up in the top eight and will need to play the playoffs, they should probably take more responsibility for the two 1-0 defeats against Atletico Madrid away and against Liverpool at San Siro in December, more than Tuesday's defeat against Arsenal. At the same time, there is a persisting issue when Cristian Chivu's side meet a strong team. The Nerazzurri struggled every match they played against a top team in both Italy and Europe, and this is becoming a major issue for them ahead of the crucial stint of the 2025-26 season. \n        \n            \n                Champions League burning questions: Arsenal and Inter's set piece clash, are Real Madrid still contenders?\n                \n                    James Benge                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSpeaking to Sky Italy, Chivu showed his admiration for Arteta and the English side, saying, \"Arsenal impressed me more than any other team. They always make the right play and constantly cause you problems with Saka, they always make the right decisions. The Premier League is truly top in terms of intensity and in Italy we're not used to that. I'm trying to bring that aspect in, but it's not easy. We're trying to grow step by step, and we need to be convinced that we're doing the right things.\"\nIn Serie A, Chivu's side have struggled against top opposition, failing to beat Napoli (one loss and one draw) and losing to both AC Milan and Juventus. In Europe, after winning their opening four matches against Ajax, Slavia Prague, Kairat, and Union SG, they suffered defeats to Atletico Madrid, Liverpool, and Arsenal. Next week, they will face Borussia Dortmund in what will be a crucial match to avoid the playoffs, something Arsenal won't need to worry about this season. \n            ",

But if those opportunities fall through, McDaniel is expected to land on the staff of Jim Harbaugh with the Chargers. The Chargers have reached the postseason in both of Harbaugh's seasons leading the team but have failed to advance past the wild-card round. After going 11-6 in the regular season, the Chargers scored just three points in their Jan. 11 postseason loss to the New England Patriots. Soon after, the team fired offensive coordinator Greg Roman after two seasons in the role. If McDaniel takes the Chargers job, he will be the fifth offensive coordinator quarterback Justin Herbert has had since being drafted by the team back in 2020. \n\n        \n            \n                NFL coaching carousel: Biggest pro and con of six remaining vacancies\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMcDaniel, 42, was also reportedly being courted by the Philadelphia Eagles and Tampa Bay Buccaneers for their vacant OC positions. Additionally, McDaniel reportedly withdrew his name from the Cleveland Browns' head-coaching search earlier Tuesday.McDaniel, who went 35-33 with the Dolphins, was the offensive coordinator of the San Francisco 49ers in 2021 before landing in Miami. After having early success in Miami that included consecutive playoff berths, McDaniel's teams went a combined 15-19 over the past two seasons. The Dolphins subsequently hired Green Bay Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley to replace McDaniel. \nAfter working with 2020 first-round pick Tua Tagovailoa in Miami, McDaniel is in line to work with another 2020 first-round pick in Herbert, a two-time Pro Bowler who set an NFL record for the most yards thrown in a player's first three seasons. But like Tagovailoa, Herbert has yet to win a playoff game. McDaniel, if he goes to Los Angeles, will be tasked with helping Herbert and the rest of the Chargers get over that hump. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Carlos Beltrán and Andruw Jones have been elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame, the BBWAA announced Tuesday night. The slugging center fields join Jeff Kent (elected by the Contemporary Baseball Era Committee last mont) in the 2026 class. As we sift through the vote percentages and look for the biggest takeaways, some winners and losers emerge beyond the obvious winner in Beltrán and Jones. Let's walk through a few.Winner: Jose AltuveWait, what? Altuve is still active. How can he be a winner here? It's indirect. There are times we see a domino effect in voting. There was always a Coors Field stigma attached to Rockies players, but once Larry Walker got in the Hall, it was mostly smooth sailing for Todd Helton. This is a different situation, obviously, but the 2017 Astros have the electronic sign-stealing scandal attached to them. In my opinion, it's why it took Beltrán four tries to get in rather than two or even just one. Now that \"El Jefe\" from that 2017 championship team is in, does it clear a less rocky path for Altuve? It feels likely. He's at 2,388 career hits with a .303 average with three batting titles, appealing to old-school voters along with WAR and JAWS numbers that likely please new-school voters. I'll allow for the possibility that Altuve's case is treated differently than Beltrán's, but this has to serve as good news overall for the 2017 MVP.\nWinner: Chase UtleyA second baseman with good prospects to make the Hall of Fame is Utley. I've discussed him as a worthy peak Hall of Fame candidate for the past three years and he's really making good headway. After getting 28.8% of the vote in his first year and 39.8% last year, he's now gotten 59.1% this time around, his third year on the ballot. If needed, there are seven more tries and his vote percentage will surely only continue to rise, especially given the relatively weak ballot we have on tap next year.\n        \n            \n                Who will be on 2027 Baseball Hall of Fame ballot? Buster Posey headlines newcomers\n                \n                    Matt Snyder                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLoser: Manny RamírezManny is now done on the ballot after failing to reach 75% on his 10th and final year. Ramírez got just 38.8% of the vote. We've seen Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens shut out twice by the Era Committee, too, and Ramírez was suspended twice for PEDs (neither Bonds nor Clemens were ever suspended). Simply, unless something extreme happens in the coming years or even decades, Ramírez will never make the Hall of Fame.Loser: Alex RodríguezIn his fifth year, A-Rod made progress again -- it's just not enough to believe he's eventually going to get all the way to the 75% of the vote he needs to make the Hall of Fame. He's now gone, respectively, from 34.3% to 35.7% to 34.8% to 37.1% to 40.0%. He no longer needs to more than double his vote tally, but it's pretty close to that. It's hard to see that happening.  \nLoser: Robinson CanóCanó, opposite of Altuve, is an indirect loser. His stats show a résumé that is worthy of induction into the Hall of Fame. He's a career .301/.351/.488 (124 OPS+) hitter with 68.7 WAR and some of the best power stats we've ever seen from a second baseman. At that position, he's second in home runs, fifth in RBI, sixth in slugging percentage and 10th in WAR. He was also nailed with an 80-game suspension for a failed PED test in 2018. Given the fate of Ramírez and how things are going for A-Rod, we can probably put the proverbial nail in the coffin of Canó's Hall of Fame case before he even gets on the ballot.Winners: Félix Hernández and a generation of starting pitchersSomething I've been harping on for a decade (I'm not kidding) is that only the absolute, top-shelf aces from the last few generations of starting pitchers are getting in. That remains the case. Of the top 50 starting pitchers in WAR in the Wild Card Era (1995-present), only Randy Johnson, Pedro Martínez, Roy Halladay, Mike Mussina, Greg Maddux, CC Sabathia, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz are in the Hall of Fame. Past generations have more than 20 starters who made it. I've already mapped this out (most recently in making Cole Hamels' case). Sure, Justin Verlander, Max Scherzer, Clayton Kershaw and probably (hopefully? surely?) Zack Greinke are headed to Cooperstown once eligible, but there's still a shortfall compared to past generations.\nPerhaps we're making progress. King Felix got 46.1% of the vote in his second try, an 25.5-point rise from his first year. Hamels debuted at a nice 23.8%. Even Andy Pettitte with his PED baggage and Mark Buehrle (a traditionally unappealing case for many voters and fans alike) showed up nicely this time around -- 48.5% and 20%, respectively. Pettitte has work to do, but he has a chance to make it in his final years on the ballot.Maybe this bodes well for the cases of Jon Lester (coming on the ballot next year), David Price (2028), Stephen Strasburg (2028), Adam Wainwright (2029), Corey Kluber (2029) and others.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Carlos Beltrán, one of the newest members of the National Baseball Hall of Fame, has not yet determined which cap he will wear on his Hall of Fame plaque, he said Tuesday. Beltrán played seven seasons with the Kansas City Royals and seven seasons with the New York Mets, and appeared in slightly more games with New York (839 to 795).\"There is no doubt my best years in baseball are with two teams -- the Kansas City Royals and the New York Mets,\" Beltrán said. \"That's a decision that I would love to sit down with my family, with (my wife) Jessica, with my kids and make a decision on that. I did really enjoy my time in New York. Now I work as an advisor for the Mets, so there's a lot of weight in the New York cap.\"Ultimately, the Hall of Fame has the final say on which team is represented on the player's plaque, though the player has input.\"The  Hall of Fame provides guidance to each new inductee as to which logo,  if any, may be represented on the cap of his plaque,\" Jon Shestakofsky,  Baseball Hall of Fame vice president of communications and content, told  CBS Sports last year. \"While the Hall of Fame has the final say as to which logo  is depicted, we work with the electee to reach an appropriate conclusion  that accurately reflects the new electee's career in the game. All  teams, however, are listed in the text of the plaque.\"\n        \n            \n                Winners and losers of Baseball Hall of Fame voting: Good news for Chase Utley and Jose Altuve, Manny falls off\n                \n                    Matt Snyder                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSeveral players who spent significant time with multiple teams, like Beltrán, have a blank cap on their Hall of Fame plaque. Roy Halladay, Greg Maddux, and Mike Mussina are among recent inductees with a blank cap.\nBeltrán played 20 seasons from 1998-2017 after being drafted by the Royals. He made his debut with Kansas City played for the Royals (1998-04), Houston Astros (2004), Mets (2005-11), San Francisco Giants (2011), St. Louis Cardinals (2012-13), New York Yankees (2014-16), Texas Rangers (2016), and Astros again (2017). He played 2,586 games total.  Beltrán retired as a .279/.350/.486 hitter with 2,725 hits, 435 home runs, and 312 stolen bases. He was also a sensational defensive center fielder at his peak. Beltrán ranks among the Mets' franchise leaders in WAR (31.1), on-base percentage (.369), slugging percentage (.500), home runs (149), and RBI (559), among other things.This was Beltrán's fourth year on the the Baseball Writers Association of America's Hall of Fame ballot. His support gradually increased from 46.5% to 57.1% to 70.3% to 84.2% this year. A player needs 75% for induction.\nAndruw Jones was also voted into the Baseball Hall of Fame on Tuesday. His plaque will almost certainly feature a Braves hat as he spent 12 of his 17 MLB seasons in Atlanta.\n            ",

Diggs made three tackles in two games with the Packers, including seeing brief action in the 31-27 loss to the Chicago Bears in the NFC wild card round. \nDiggs, 27, enjoyed a fast start to his career that included leading the NFL with 11 interceptions in 2021, his second season.

    "body": "\n        The New York Knicks have hit rock bottom. They were blown out Monday night by a Dallas Mavericks team that had seven players on the injury list, but still managed to cruise to a 114-97 win at Madison Square Garden. Fans rained down boos once again as the Knicks put together another pitiful performance, and coach Mike Brown said after the game that he understood the sentiment of the fans.\"I'm OK with the boos. If we're playing crappy, boo,\" Brown said. \"If I was in the stands, I'd probably boo, too. You pay hard money to come to the game.\"Following the loss -- the ninth in the Knicks' last 11 outings -- star guard Jalen Brunson called for a players-only meeting to talk about the struggles, per ESPN. Brunson reportedly urged his teammates to \"find answers\" instead of looking to the coaching staff to fix their problems.\n        \n            \n                Things can't get much worse for 'desperate' Knicks -- but will they get better at the trade deadline?\n                \n                    John Gonzalez                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nJosh Hart told reporters after the game that the team needs to do some \"soul searching\" amid a stretch of \"embarrassing basketball.\"\n\"I think we all need to do some soul searching, some looking in the mirror and figuring out what we're going to do individually, what we're going to do as a team, what our identity is right now,\" Hart said. \"Right now we're playing embarrassing basketball. We're not executing on the offensive end and defensively we've been abysmal. We've really been terrible defensively all year. At some point we have to look in the mirror and realize no one out here is feeling sorry for us. We have enough. We've shown that, we have to figure out how to get that sense of urgency.\"Brunson echoed Hart's sentiments after the loss, but said the soul searching \"should've started a couple weeks ago.\"\"We got to start tomorrow. We've got to figure this out fast,\" Brunson said. The Knicks have been abysmal since the calendar flipped, and if things don't get figured out quickly, you can forget an NBA championship, they might not even make the Eastern Conference finals with the way they've been playing. Some of their losses have been against tough opponents, sure. The San Antonio Spurs and Detroit Pistons have been better than New York all season. But losing to the Sacramento Kings? Allowing 75 points in the first half to a Mavericks team that has no real offensive identity outside of giving Cooper Flagg the ball and seeing what happens? That's just embarrassing.\nThe Knicks have relied too much on their offense to win games. Through the first two months of the season, that was enough. They had a 21-9 record after a close win against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Christmas. Since then, it's just been open season for any team they're playing against.Since the start of January, only the Utah Jazz, Brooklyn Nets and New Orleans Pelicans -- teams with a combined 36-93 record -- have been worse defensively than the Knicks. If the Knicks want to be taken seriously as a championship contender, they have to show more effort on the defensive end.Hart says the team has enough to right the ship, and maybe that's true, but if not this could prove to be the perfect moment for a trade to be made ahead of the Feb. 5 deadline. Things can't keep going in this direction. At 25-18, the Knicks are sitting third in the East, but things can go south in a hurry even in an inferior conference.\nThe Knicks need to find answers fast, otherwise this team will fall short of expectations yet again when the playoffs start.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        When Jimmy Butler crumbled to the floor on Monday night and started dropping F bombs as he held his right knee, which was confirmed as a torn ACL on Tuesday, the Warriors' season, which was at least starting to trend upward, ended. You have to wonder if the same can be said for Golden State's Stephen Curry era. I know, on some level, it's too early to start talking about finality for a guy who is still nowhere near his end as a superstar player. But we're all thinking it. If the window for a fifth championship was still even slightly cracked, if only in theory, it has almost certainly shut short of two unlikely scenarios playing out. The first one would be trading Butler, which is unlikely but at least worth considering. Now you might be asking yourself, who would want to trade for a 36-year-old historically malcontent player who is on the books for almost $60 million next season and won't even be able to play for the next 10-12 months? A team with its own crappy contract to get rid of. Our Sam Quinn outlined some possible trades that would fit this construct, with Anthony Davis and Joel Embiid at the top of the list. Personally, I think the Sixers are starting to like their chances with a currently dominant Embiid in the East this year, even if it would probably be a smart move to get off that contract before the next inevitable injury arrives. \nBut let's say the Sixers would be up for it. Would the Warriors? Almost certainly not. Embiid is due $59.5 million next season, $64.3 million the season after that, and $69 million in 2028-29 when he'll be 34 and basically certain to be completely broken down. He's barely holding it together at 31. Even making it the remainder of this season healthy is a long shot. And that's before we even consider the fit of a lumbering big man in a Steph Curry offense. Davis is easier to envision. He's also a long shot to stay healthy through a playoff run (hell, he's not even healthy right now), but he's expected to be back this season and he comes off the books one year before Embiid even if he were to exercise his $62.7 million player option in 2027-28. At full strength, Davis is interesting enough to pacify the puncher's-chance fans even if there's almost no way he would actually stay healthy -- to say nothing of the issues he would pose as a clunky shooter next to Draymond Green. \nI'm sure the Kings would be open to talking about a deal for DeMar DeRozan or Domantas Sabonis for Butler and Jonathan Kuminga, whom Sacramento coveted this summer. If there is one trade that would possibly keep the Warriors in the contention picture this year and beyond, it might be Lauri Markannen. Unfortunately, Danny Ainge shows up to these meetings in a ski mask and the Warriors didn't hold onto their two-timeline dream this long just to get robbed. Who knows if the Warriors will even discuss these or any Butler deals, let alone actually pull one of them off. At the moment, GM Mike Dunleavy is saying he doesn't envision trading Butler. \nEven that's just a smokescreen designed to keep some form of leverage in a potential deal rather than announce your desperation, to convince yourself that all these pieces are just going to magically fall into perfect place, remain healthy, and deliver another championship run to team that currently resides in the No. 8 seed of a murderous Western Conference is a major reach. My dad would call it a pipe dream, and the older I get the more I realize that man is rarely wrong. \nAnd so, if a Butler trade either isn't going to happen or isn't going to put Curry in a realistic position to compete for a fifth career championship with the Warriors, then his only chance to do so would be with another team. Now, I have a lot of thoughts on the trading-a-franchise-icon front. First and foremost, you don't consider doing it for a second unless the player has either demanded out or the return is going to set up your next decade when your current window has closed. This is why Nico Harrison was a moron. The Luka Doncic trade didn't check either of those boxes. And Curry means incalculably more to the Warriors than Luka did to Dallas. Trading him would shake the Bay Area and greater basketball world to its core. Having said that, I grew up in Northern California, have been a Warriors fan all my life, hold Steph Curry, athletically speaking, in an almost religious regard, and I wouldn't have a problem with him finishing his career elsewhere. \nI'm a grown man with a family and bills. Sports don't impact my life like that anymore; they entertain me, and Curry gunning for No. 5 on the Rockets, just as an example, would entertain me greatly. Tampa Tom Brady was awesome. If Curry were to ever open up this relocation conversation, we can reopen the one about him possibly winning a fifth ring.For now, every indication he's ever given is that he places more value on finishing with the Warriors than possibly finishing with a fifth ring. That could change. Curry is as competitive as they come. He's still an elite player. The Warriors could still get a major return, much like Boston when it traded Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett, that could set up the next era. Again, maybe a conversation will happen at some point. I seriously doubt it. Either way, until then, the best the Warriors can do is try to remain competitive over Curry's closing chapter (nobody wants to see the final Kobe years with the Lakers). They may even still make a Jonathan Kuminga margin move at the deadline. But here's the reality: The moment Butler hit the ground on Monday night, a lot more than just this season ended. It feels likely that Stephen Curry is done chasing championships with the Warriors.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        By the time Arda Guler slid on the pitch at the Santiago Bernabeu in the 63rd minute to cleanly nick the ball off of an opponent's feet, Real Madrid were already in a good mood. Kylian Mbappe's fifth-minute goal was merely the first of several goals they put past Monaco, the hosts up 4-0 when Guler intervened yards from the penalty area. The ball landed at Vinicius Junior's feet, who balanced Guler's grit in that moment for a demonstration of pure skill – he found space as not one, but two Monaco players struggled to keep him at bay and slot a tricky angular finish into the back of the net.It was merely the latest in a game of impressive displays from Vinicius, who had two assists beforehand and was the star of the show as Los Blancos aimed to restore some normalcy after a chaotic few weeks (even if the drama was of the club's own creation). In some ways, the eventual 6-1 drubbing of Monaco did exactly what it needed to in offering a semblance of a reminder that there's room for Vinicius alongside Kylian Mbappe, as well as some of Madrid's other stars.\nVinicius had as many goal contributions against Monaco as he did in his previous 11 matches for Real Madrid, undeniably a strong outing for an important player in a less-than-ideal run of form. The Brazil international was the standout but it was an outing defined by sharing the spotlight – he assisted Mbappe's second with a simple but effective pass, and later was diligent enough to stay with the ball before setting up Franco Mastantuono for a close-range finish.\nHe mixed in a very public hug with new Real Madrid manager Alvaro Arbeloa, which may prove to be more memorable than the strong performance because of the narrative-driven cloud that always looms over the club (again, likely by their own creation). The disagreements between Vincius and ex-coach Xabi Alonso, whose ouster last week remains a topic of conversation, remains still top of mind because of his public display of professional affection for Arbeloa – but does not answer the question of where Los Blancos go from here.\nVinicius, Mbappe, Mastantuono and Guler successfully co-existed on Tuesday, again in a set-up where Mbappe was in a central role – much as Alonso preferred. Arbeloa has rotated through his options a bit in attack, giving Gonzalo Garcia the start over Mastantuono in Saturday's 2-0 win over Levante but Guler and Mastantuono each had a notable cameo in the second half. There is a caveat to be made that three games is not much to judge a coach on, but he seems intent on finding a way to make Vinicius and Mbappe work together.How exactly Arbeloa puts his spin on things is still a little bit unknown, though, just as is the ultimate question of how successful it will be. Finding the balance between all of Los Blancos' stars was Alonso's big task and even if the club's higher-ups did not care for his solution, the question still needs to be answered by someone. Arbeloa's star-focused strategy against Monaco may not be all that impressive, though, considering the fact that the Ligue 1 side are midtable as things stand and may not make it through to the Champions League knockouts depending on the final results of the league phase.Truthfully, stiffer tests await Arbeloa's Real Madrid. While there will be plenty of intrigue around their final league phase match at Benfica next week, where Arbeloa will face his former Madrid manager Jose Mourinho as the Portuguese side fight to advance to the next round, there is a fascinating matchup before that in Villarreal, who sit third place in LaLiga ahead of Saturday's clash. There is no shame in Madrid taking all the victories they can but it will take more than Tuesday's demolition of Monaco to erode skepticism that a lineup with Vinicius and Mbappe will be balanced enough to not only work on any given day, but can help them overtake Barcelona in league play and challenge for the Champions League.\nEven as Vinicius provides Arbeloa – and Real Madrid's leaders, by default – with a vote of confidence, there is still much they need to do to justify Alonso's surprise firing, too.\n            ",

Last week saw Minnesota play its most complete game of the year, scoring its second-most points (31) while allowing its fewest (0) as J.J. McCarthy had his best game as a pro. The second-year QB had three passing touchdowns and no turnovers as he has a great chance of continuing that type of production versus Dallas' 31st-ranked scoring defense, especially with it still missing CB Trevon Diggs (knee). The Cowboys rank dead last, however, in passing defense, with additional bottom-two rankings in both third-down defense and redzone defense. The Vikings' defense is light years ahead of the Cowboys, with the former ranking No. 3 in the redzone and No. 4 against the pass. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Cowboys can coverThe Cowboys have covered in four of their last five home games in 2025, while the Vikings have dropped four of their last five, overall, versus the spread. Dallas' success is predicated on its offense, which is elite, as Dak Prescott leads the NFL in both passing yards and QBR, as the Cowboys rank first in total yards and third in points scored. At home, the Cowboys are averaging 32.7 points, which is twice as much as the 16 ppg that the Vikings are averaging outside of Minneapolis. Additionally, no team has committed more turnovers than the Vikings, who also have the league's second-worst turnover differential, and giving the ball away will only allow Dallas' high-octane offense to put more points on the scoreboard. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Cowboys vs. Vikings picksSportsLine's model has simulated Vikings vs. Cowboys 10,000 times is going Over on the total, projecting 50 combined points.

    "body": "\nA pair of AFC playoff hopefuls will meet in a pivotal 'Monday Night Football' matchup to conclude NFL Week 15 as the Miami Dolphins visit the Pittsburgh Steelers. Miami (6-7) has won six straight, most recently defeating the Jets, 34-10, to get back into postseason contention. Pittsburgh (7-6) is coming off a 27-22 win over Baltimore and sits atop the AFC North. The Steelers lead the all-time series by the narrowest of margins, 15-14.Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from Acrisure Stadium in Pittsburgh. Miami won the last matchup, 16-10, back in 2022. The latest Dolphins vs. Steelers odds have Pittsburgh as 3-point home favorites, while the over/under for total points scored is 42.5. Before making any Steelers vs. Dolphins     picks, be sure to see the NFL predictions from SportsLine's projection model.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

Miami's defense has risen to the occasion as of late, holding each of its last four opponents to 17 points or fewer while also notching 10 takeaways during this stretch. On offense, Mike McDaniel has a rushing unit that ranks fifth in yards per carry and eighth in yards per game. De'Von Achane is on pace for nearly 2,000 scrimmage yards, while Jaylen Wright had 107 yards and a touchdown last week. The Dolphins also get to face a Pittsburgh defense that is reminding no one of the Steel Curtain, as the Steelers rank 27th or worse in total yards allowed, passing defense and third-down defense. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why the Steelers can coverThis game is in Pittsburgh at night, which plays into the forecast calling for a game time temperature of 25 degrees. That's relevant because Miami has lost 13 straight games with temps under 40 degrees, as Tua Tagovailoa is 0-8 in his career in such contests. The Dolphins quarterback has had a season to forget, as he leads the NFL with 14 interceptions and now has to face a Pittsburgh defense which has racked up the second-most takeaways (23). As for Aaron Rodgers, he's coming off a season-high of 284 passing yards and also rushed for his first score since 2022 in last week's win over Baltimore. He faced the Dolphins twice last year while with the Jets, and the four-time MVP totaled five passing touchdowns and averaged 306.5 yards through the air. See which team to back at SportsLine. How to make Steelers vs. Dolphins           picksFor Dolphins vs. Steelers on 'Monday Night Football,' the model is leaning Over the total, projecting 45 combined points.

    "body": "\n        Xabi Alonso may have just bought himself a few more days as Real Madrid's manager with a 2-1 win at Alaves on Sunday, even if the stylistic clashes that have loomed large over his employment status were still very much on display.The game felt like a push-and-pull between Alonso's envisioned look for the team and one reportedly preferred by the higher-ups, the manager perhaps obliging his bosses by giving each of Kylian Mbappe, Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo a start for the first time in league play this season. In some ways, it was the best of both worlds – first came Alonso's version, in which frequent starters Jude Bellingham and Mbappe combined for the game's opening goal in the 24th minute. The flourish with which Mbappe scored against Alaves, with a long run down the flank and a sharp finish from the edge of the box, offered a clear reminder that he is the greatest beneficiary of Alonso's arrival thus far. His underwhelming first season in the Spanish capital is officially a thing of the past, 27 goals now under his belt across all competitions.\nThe second goal, scored eight minutes after Alaves' equalizer in the 68th minute, was a welcome sight for Alonso – and for Vinicius and Rodrygo. The Brazilians partnered for Real Madrid's game winner, equally impressive to Mbappe's strike. Vinicius and Alaves' Jonny Otto both fervently ran for a loose ball but it was the former who won the battle and got his head on the ball, pushing the ball just far enough for him to outrun Otto. He cut his way into the box and noticed Rodrygo making a well-timed run to his right, with Rodrygo wasting no time with a clinical finish in front of goal. A few short days after snapping a 30-plus game goalless run, Rodrygo had a second to cap off a strong week from an individual standpoint.\nAlonso's meet-in-the-middle approach was perhaps to be expected, and not only because he sits on the hot seat. Real Madrid's stars have an impressive hold on the club's culture, an outlier in a period where teams are defined more by the systems their managers set. Alonso seemed to have the support to redefine the club's cadence when he took the helm six months ago but before Wednesday's loss to Manchester City in the UEFA Champions League, the manager seemed to make the concession that he was the one who needed to make an adjustment.\n\"Being Madrid manager is not about changing [the culture]; it is about adapting,\" Alonso said on Tuesday. \"We know the culture of Real Madrid pretty well; that is why it is the biggest club in the world. You have to adapt, learn a lot, interact with the players. Some days are good, some not so good. We have to face that with energy and positivity; that is the only way to turn things around.\"A look at Sunday's result alone suggests that Alonso can and should find the best of both worlds, since it may have bought him at least a few more days of employment. A deeper look at the performance, though, is more discouraging – four days after a very encouraging performance against City, signs of Madrid's improvement under Alonso were not exactly easy to spot. If it was not for three stoppage time shots, Los Blancos would have ended the game with just 1.19 expected goals from 10 shots, less effective than the 1.33 expected goals Alaves managed from six attempts. The expected goals tally would have been their third-worst in La Liga this season and uncharacteristic for Alonso's Madrid, the manager steadily increasing their attacking output from 1.76 non-penalty expected goals last season to their pre-Alaves average of 1.99 per match.\nLetting the stars run the show may have bought Alonso time, which may be the right strategy as he tries to instill a brand-new method of operations at a club seemingly reluctant to embrace it. How sustainable the approach will be, though, is a question that has lingered long before Alonso's arrival – and one that even justified his hire in the first place. If Sunday's performance is anything to go by, though, the star-focused strategy can only afford the manager so much more time and reinforces the fact that this is still a mess of the higher-ups' making, not Alonso's.\n            ",

However, Dak Prescott is pretty well-equipped to handle all the pressures that Brian Flores will be trying to throw at him in this game. The Dallas quarterback ranks first in the NFL in pressured completion percentage (62.5%) and fourth in blitzed completion percentage (70.3%). The model predicts that he throws a couple of touchdown passes on average and that the Cowboys cover in 61% of simulations.Over 47.5 pointsWith the No. 3 scoring offense and second-worst scoring defense in the NFL, Cowboys games have been a gold mine for Over bettors. The Over has hit in eight of the last 10 Dallas games and nine of its 13 contests overall. Meanwhile, J.J. McCarthy just had his first career three-touchdown game last week in the win over Washington and Minnesota posted its second-highest rushing total (162 yards) of the year. The model predicts 50 combined points on average and that the Over hits in 53% of simulations.Responsible gamingResponsible gaming is a serious topic, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users play responsibly.

Lake Mary trailed Vero Beach with just a few seconds left on the clock when it connected on a Hail Mary -- in a monsoon no less -- to win the title.With eight seconds left in the fourth quarter, Lake Mary trailed 27-12 when quarterback Noah Grubbs dropped back for one final heave. Grubbs, a three-star Notre Dame signee and the No. 31 quarterback in the 2026 recruiting cycle, connected with receiver Barrett Schulz downfield.The only problem was that Schulz, a three-star FIU signee playing in his future home stadium, was several yards short of the end zone. As he fought off several Vero Beach tacklers, Schulz turned and handed the ball off to teammate Tavarius Brundidge Jr., who found paydirt for the game-winning touchdown.\nThe exchange between Schulz and Brundidge looked close to being an illegal forward pass. Asked about that after the game, Vero Beach coach Lenny Jankowski said his team was the victim of a freak play.\"Yeah, there's a lot of things. I mean, the kid had gone out of bounds and came back in. Hats off. It was an incredible play to keep it alive. It's a freakish thing, and unfortunately we came up on the short end of it.\"\nThat play wasn't the only miraculous aspect of this win for Lake Mary, which captured its first state championship in school history. The Rams trailed 21-3 at halftime, and they were in position to win the game at the end because Vero Beach took an intentional safety with 12 seconds left.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Sports bettors can spice up Sunday's NFL Week 15 games with the latest DraftKings promo code, which gives new users $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins. Many of the NFL games with playoff implications occur later on Sunday, including a Sunday Night Football matchup when the Dallas Cowboys host the Minnesota Vikings. The Cowboys, who at 6-6-1 are in the playoff mix, have been elite at home in recent weeks, with victories over both teams that played in last year's Super Bowl. That's a trend the SportsLine Projection Model expects to continue on Sunday Night Football, backing the Cowboys to cover as 5.5-point favorites in its NFL best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook, down a half-point from the opener. Cowboys vs. Vikings has an over-under of 47.5, down one from the opening line, and the model is calling for a 30-20 Dallas victory.A pair of SportsLine's top experts have picked a side from games in the 4 p.m. ET slate that could vie for the game of the week for Rams vs. Lions (+6, 54.5) and Packers vs. Broncos (+1.5, 42.5). Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters Week 15 on a 50-35 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Sunday NFL best bets at DraftKings SportsbookBroncos (+1.5) vs. PackersLions (+6) vs. RamsCowboys (-5.5) vs. VikingsCombining the model's three picks into a Sunday NFL parlay at DraftKings would result in a payout of +576 (risk $100 to win $576). Bet it at DraftKings here:\nBroncos (+1.5) vs. Packers\"Is the marketplace overmanaging and overthinking too much for this clash? The Broncos should not be underdogs at home against anybody, not with a 10-game SU win streak,\" legendary SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall said. \"The fact Denver is winning these games close shouldn't be held against Sean Payton's crew; their style of game simply is methodical, with few big plays these days on offense, and the defense is good enough to win most games. Margins can start to expand for Denver when the stop unit begins to convert pick-sixes and scoop-and-scores like a year ago. That hasn't happened as much this season, but the Broncos keep winning as Bo Nix and the offense do just enough each week. Note the Pack has covered just three of its last 12 away.\" Back the Broncos at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Lions (+6) vs. Rams\"I have the Rams as the best team in the league in my power ratings, but I'm jumping on the Lions with this line at 6 at DraftKings,\" SportsLine NFL expert R.J. White said. \"Detroit has the No. 1 scoring offense in the league after a big game against the Cowboys, with a top-five mark in net yards per pass attempt and yards per rush. Recent losses have come down to uncharacteristic struggles on fourth down, and a typical day on that front will allow them to stay close. There are a few teams I trust more to get a backdoor cover if needed as well. The lookahead was 4.5 and the Lions had a much-needed big win. Why the inflation? I think this line should be 4.\" Back Detroit at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Cowboys (-5.5) vs. VikingsThe Cowboys are 4-1-1 straight up at home this season, and 4-2 against the spread at AT&T Stadium. Dallas defeated the Eagles, 24-21, and the Chiefs, 31-28, at home over the last three weeks, and this current version of the Vikings isn't nearly the competition level of the two teams that played in last year's Super Bowl. Dallas is third in the NFL in scoring at 29.3 ppg this season, including 32.7 ppg at home. Dallas gave up 44 points on the road to the Lions last week, but their defense has performed much better at home since adding to the unit at the trade deadline. Vikings quarterback J.J. McCarthy has the third-worst quarterback rating of 48 QBs this season. The Vikings are 26th in the league at 19.6 ppg this season, and the model doesn't expect Minnesota to be able to keep pace with Dallas, projecting the Cowboys to cover in 60% of simulations. Back the Cowboys at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:\nWant more NFL picks?You've seen some of the model's Sunday best bets.

    "body": "\n        ARLINGTON, Texas -- There are four weeks remaining in the 2025 NFL regular season, but for the Minnesota Vikings (5-8) and Dallas Cowboys (6-6-1), Sunday night's Week 15 matchup already feels like a playoff game.Minnesota will be eliminated from playoff contention with a loss, and for a Dallas squad that has just a 12.2% chance to reach the postseason per SportsLine, the Cowboys are essentially in the same boat. The weight of walking the playoff tightrope and needing to win out is such that quarterback Dak Prescott feels it even when he's sitting on the couch at home.\"That's a good question. It's not heavy,\" Prescott said Thursday. \"Even if I feel it — and obviously I think about it a lot — I say that to say that I want that. That's unfortunately the situation that we've put ourselves in, and it's the only way that we can get out of it.\"It's not like, 'Oh my God, I can't believe this is on me,' or that it's stressful,\" he continued. \"This is just the avenue that we have to go, and the only way we can get out of this is handling our business. Whether we're cheering on other teams to lose or not, more importantly, we've got to come in each and every day and focus on the now. Just be present, and when you're able to do that, you'll be OK with the result at the end of the day.\"\nThe burden on Prescott will be lighter than it was in Dallas' 44-30 Week 14 loss at Detroit. Wide receiver CeeDee Lamb will return 10 days after suffering a concussion against the Lions, and cornerback Trevon Diggs (knee) said Friday that he expects to play Sunday night after missing the last seven games. Diggs is officially listed as questionable.Where to watch Cowboys vs. VikingsDate: Sunday, Dec. 14 | Time: 8:20 p.m. ETLocation: AT&T Stadium (Arlington, Texas)TV: NBC | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Cowboys -5.5, O/U 48.5 (via DraftKings Sportsbook)Cowboys vs. Vikings: Need to knowDak Prescott vs. Brian Flores' blitz\nVikings defensive coordinator Brian Flores presents a strength-on-strength matchup with his relentless blitz packages. Minnesota sends five or more pass rushers on a league-high 49.2% of opponent dropbacks, per TruMedia. The next-closest team, Atlanta, is at 40.4%.When blitzing, the Vikings allow a 58% completion rate (ninth-lowest in the NFL) and just 6.2 yards per attempt (fifth-lowest). Prescott has been one of the league's best quarterbacks against pressure, ranking third in completion percentage (68.5%) and passing yards (1,137) versus the blitz this season.\n\"Just over time, certain blitzes, certain looks you see better than others,\" Prescott said. \"It's hard to surprise me, but you still have to be on your P's and Q's. Hell, I just got hit two weeks ago against one, Kansas City, and threw an interception. I'm far from having it all dialed in.\"\"[Brian Flores] is a play caller who likes to win the game with the plays that he's dialing up — the way he's attacking offenses and the looks he's presenting, giving us curveballs and making it tough on us. So yeah, why I relish this challenge is that it's as much of a game as anything — a challenge to me mentally, what I'm seeing on film and being able to decipher it and get us into the right protections, the right looks and plays against all the different looks.\"Dak Prescott vs. the blitz (2025 season)NFL RanksCompletion percentage68.5%3rdPass Yards1,1373rdPass TD9T-8thPasser Rating106.411thExpected points added (EPA) per dropback0.218thAaron Jones' Texas homecoming\nAaron Jones returns to AT&T Stadium hoping for another massive Texas homecoming. Jones will be making his AT&T Stadium debut as a Minnesota Viking on Sunday, but the El Paso native has plenty of history against his hometown team after four matchups as a Green Bay Packer. He has more than 100 rushing yards and at least one touchdown in all four of his career games against his childhood team, joining Pro Football Hall of Fame running back LaDainian Tomlinson as the only other player in NFL history to begin his career with four such games in a row against a single opponent, including the postseason, per OptaStats. Tomlinson's victim was the Cleveland Browns.The last time Jones visited AT&T Stadium was in the Packers' 48-32 wild-card round romp of the Cowboys in the 2023 season. He went off for playoff career highs of 118 yards and three touchdowns on 21 carries, an efficient 5.6 yards per carry. Jones' production that day tied the NFL all-time record for rushing touchdowns in a road playoff game, rushing touchdowns in a wild-card round game and rushing touchdowns in a Packers postseason game. Current Cowboys defensive tackle Kenny Clark was on the Green Bay sideline for that effort, and he is looking forward to seeing his ex-teammate of seven seasons with the Packers on Sunday night.\"Man, it's going to be great, man. I'm always excited to play him. He's from out this way, so he gets a lot of energy coming to play the Cowboys,\" Clark said. \"I'm excited to play him. A great player, a guy that I've been having a lot of respect for for many years.\"Aaron Jones' career vs. Cowboys (4 games)StatPer Game AverageCarries8320.8Rushing yards488122.0Rushing first downs317.8Rushing touchdowns92.3J.J. McCarthy vs. Dallas' pass defense\nJ.J. McCarthy versus the Cowboys' pass defense is a stoppable force vs. a movable object. McCarthy produced the best start of his young career -- all seven games -- in a 31-0 victory over the Commanders in Week 14: 163 yards and three touchdown passes on 16 of 23 passing.However, he remains dead last in the NFL in completion percentage (56%), TD-to-INT ratio (9-10) and passer rating (67.4) this season among 34 qualified quarterbacks. McCarthy has been so rough this season that Justin Jefferson is averaging just 62.3 receiving yards per game in 2025, which is stunning considering his previous career low for a season was the 87.5 he produced as a rookie in 2020. The four-time Pro Bowl wideout is the NFL's all-time receiving yards per game leader (91.6), but alongside McCarthy, Jefferson has only 15 receiving yards across the last two games combined. On the other side is a Cowboys defense that is allowing the most passing yards per game (255.2) in the league this season.Cowboys vs. Vikings prediction, pick\nDallas' cornerback position has been a mess in 2025, but McCarthy won't be able to capitalize on those deficiencies, as the Cowboys can pressure him with their trio of high-impact defensive tackles -- All-Pro Quinnen Williams, three-time Pro Bowler Kenny Clark and Osa Odighizuwa. Prescott will be able to make more than enough plays against Flores' blitz with both Lamb and George Pickens at his disposal, and the Cowboys roll to a much-needed victory on \"Sunday Night Football.\"Pick: Dallas 27, Minnesota 10 | Cowboys -5.5, Under 48.5\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Atlanta Hawks big man Kristaps Porziņģis is expected to be sidelined for the next two weeks as he undergoes further evaluation stemming from an illness he's been dealing with, per ESPN. Porziņģis has already missed six of the team's last seven games due to the illness, and while he's going to miss some more time, the Hawks want to prioritize the long-term of this season, rather than a few more missed games in December.This isn't the first time Porziņģis has dealt with a mysterious illness. During the 2025 NBA playoffs when he was still a member of the Boston Celtics, the Latvian big man struggled with lethargy, saying, \"The breathing wasn't good. I did everything I could potentially to feel as good as I could, but my engine wasn't running the way I wanted.\" He played through the postseason, but mustered only 25 total points in Boston second-round loss to the Knicks. In four of the six games, he played fewer than 15 minutes a night.Porziņģis was later diagnosed in the offseason with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), which is an autonomic disorder causing rapid heart rate, and dizziness when standing as blood in the body doesn't evenly distribute across the body. After the diagnosis, Porziņģis and his doctors found ways to manage his POTS, which includes things like a high salt diet. He was able to play for the Latvian national team at EuroBasket this past summer, where he averaged 20.2 points and 8.7 rebounds over six games.\nHowever, Porziņģis, 30, said in early December, after returning from missing four consecutive games to drop 25 points, that he doesn't believe what he's dealing with currently is related to POTS.\"No, I wouldn't say it's the same thing,\" Porziņģis said after the Hawks' loss to the Nuggets on Dec. 5. \"I just wasn't feeling too good, honestly. Just not being healthy healthy, you know? But I wouldn't say it's the same stuff from last season, so that's good.  \"I think I kind of put that behind me even this summer playing for the national team, but anyway, just catching whatever it's frustrating, you know? I want to be healthy. And I will be healthy.\"\nThe hope is that a resolution will come of Porziņģis' illness, because when he's healthy he's capable of getting you a double-double one most nights as a two-way big who can space the floor out to the 3-point line and provide high-level rim protection on defense.\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe Dallas Cowboys returned from their bye and posted three consecutive victories to give themselves an opportunity to earn a playoff berth, but they made their path to the postseason much more difficult with their 44-30 road loss to the Detroit Lions last week.Dallas' playoff chances weren't great prior to the matchup with Detroit, but they became much slimmer with the defeat as the Cowboys (6-6-1) will need plenty of help before they host the Minnesota Vikings (5-8) at 8:20 p.m. ET on Sunday Night Football. Their best shot at a postseason spot is overtaking the reigning Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles (8-5), who enter Week 15 of the 2025 NFL season with a three-game losing streak, for the NFC East title.The San Francisco 49ers and Chicago Bears occupy the final two wild card spots in the conference with 9-4 records, and a loss to the Vikings would effectively end the Cowboys' chances to grab one of those berths. But even with a win, Dallas would need Philadelphia's struggles to continue, and the Eagles are hosting the 2-11 Las Vegas Raiders on Sunday and face the 3-10 Washington Commanders twice over the final three weeks of the season.Minnesota ended its four-game slide with a 31-0 rout of Washington last week and would like nothing better than to deal a major blow to Dallas' playoff hopes. The Vikings will have to find a way to slow down CeeDee Lamb, however, as the Cowboys star receiver is expected to be in the lineup after exiting last week's contest with a concussion. The 26-year-old wideout was extremely effective against the Lions prior to leaving in the second quarter, hauling in six passes for 121 yards.Eight games are on Sunday's NBA schedule, including a matchup between the Golden State Warriors (13-13) and Portland Trail Blazers (9-16) at 9 p.m. ET at the Moda Center. The Trail Blazers have lost six of their last seven contests but won both of their previous meetings with the Warriors this season.Meanwhile, the NHL has six games on its slate, one of which has the Montreal Canadiens (16-11-4) hosting the Edmonton Oilers (15-11-6) at the Bell Centre at 7 p.m. ET. The Oilers enter with a point streak that reached five games with their 6-3 road triumph over the Toronto Maple Leafs on Saturday.There also are plenty of college basketball games on Sunday, including a matchup between Washington State (3-7) and USC (9-1) at 7:30 p.m. ET at the Galen Center in Los Angeles. The Cougars are in the midst of a four-game losing streak, while the Trojans bounced back from their lone defeat of the season with a 94-81 triumph over San Diego last time out.The Cowboys are 5.5-point favorites against the Vikings in the latest consensus NFL odds. The Warriors are 4.5-point favorites against the Trail Blazers, the Oilers are -130 favorites on the money line against the Canadiens and USC is a 14.5-point favorite against Washington State.Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Sunday, Dec. 14. All times EasternNFL best bets, where to watchVikings at CowboysTime: 8:20 p.m. | Location: Arlington, Tex. | TV: NBC | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Cowboys -5.5 (-112) | Expert: J.J. McCarthy Over 28.5 pass attempts (-123)The teams are meeting for the first time since 2022, when the Cowboys outgained the Vikings 458-183 in total yards and rolled to a 40-3 victory at Minnesota. It was Dallas' fifth win in its last six matchups against the Vikings but first in that span by more than four points. The SportsLine Projection Model sees another comfortable triumph by the Cowboys, who cover the spread in 61% of its simulations. SportsLine fantasy football expert Dave Richard (11-2, +980 on his last 13 NFL player prop picks) believes J.J. McCarthy will be throwing the ball often since Minnesota's ground attack may not be effective against Dallas' defense.More NFL best betsTitans-49ers Over 44.5 (-108, Sportsline model A-rated play)Packers -115 (R.J.

The Warriors have exceeded their 113.7-point average in back-to-back games after producing 112 or fewer in five consecutive contests, while the Trail Blazers have scored more than their average of 117.5 points in three of their last five outings. And even though Golden State and Portland combined for 250 or more points in both of their previous meetings this campaign, the SportsLine Projection Model's simulations say the Under for Sunday's matchup hits almost 71% of the time. SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall (33-19, +1206 on his last 52 NBA ATS picks) likes Golden State to cover since the Trail Blazers are reeling and Stephen Curry, who averaged 36.5 points against Portland over the first two showdowns, is back from his quad injury.NHL best bets, where to watchOilers at CanadiensTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Montreal | TV: NHL Network | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine pick -- Model: Canadiens +109Both teams were on the road Saturday, with Edmonton posting a three-goal victory in Toronto and Montreal dropping an overtime decision to the Rangers in New York. The Canadiens have won only one of their last four contests both overall (1-2-1) and at home (1-3-0), while the Oilers have won three straight on the road. However, that streak has only improved Edmonton's record away from home to 7-8-3, and the SportsLine Projection Model thinks the run will end as Montreal wins in 54% of its simulations.CBB best bets, where to watchWashington State at USCTime: 7:30 p.m. | Location: Los Angeles | TV: FS1 | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine pick -- Model: USC -14.5 (-112)The Cougars have lost seven of the nine games they've played against teams with a record over .500 and are facing a Trojans squad that received another strong offensive performance from Chad Baker-Mazara in Tuesday's 94-81 triumph over San Diego. The senior guard scored 31 points on 8-of-11 shooting, marking the fourth consecutive game and sixth this season in which he produced at least 21 points. Baker-Mazara is fifth in the nation in scoring with an average of 21.9 points, and the SportsLine Projection Model sees him helping the Trojans to a big win on Sunday as they cover the spread in 56% of its simulations.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Green Bay Packers may have to finish out the 2025 season without their most important defensive player, as the team believes pass rusher Micah Parsons suffered a torn ACL during their Week 15 loss to the Denver Broncos, according to multiple reports. Further testing is required to confirm the initial diagnosis. On a first-and-10 in the third quarter, Parsons fought his way to Broncos quarterback Bo Nix, but planted awkwardly with his left leg. He immediately went down holding his knee. Check out what happened here:\nParsons remained on the turf for several moments as he was attended to by trainers. Players from both teams took knees around the star pass rusher -- who was eventually able to get up and walk to the locker room with the medical staff. \nIf it is indeed a torn ACL for Parsons, his recovery timeline could carry deep into the offseason and threaten his availability for the 2026 opener. While ACL recoveries generally take 6-8 months, CBS Sports injury analyst Marty Jaramillo says that Parsons' explosiveness as an edge rusher could force him to ease back into action more slowly than if he played a different position.\n\"When you have that kind of speed, that talent that he was born with … that's going to delay the rehab just a little bit,\" Jaramillo said on CBS Sports HQ. \"Once we get the ACL healed and he strengthens his entire body and he's ready to start running, then we start adding change of direction. The constant cutting in all directions with also stop-go acceleration, that's the real window. We're going to look at him in possibly 8-10 months for an athlete at that position, someone as explosive as Micah Parsons.\"Entering Sunday, Parsons had recorded 39 tackles, 12.5 sacks, 26 QB hits and a forced fumble this season. He became the first player since sacks became an official stat in 1982 to begin a career with five seasons of at least 12 sacks.The Packers, of course, acquired Parsons from the Dallas Cowboys just weeks before the season started in exchange for defensive tackle Kenny Clark and two first-round picks. Once the trade was official, Green Bay gave Parsons the contract extension he was seeking -- a four-year, $188 million deal. \nParsons was regarded by the franchise as an X-factor for a potential Super Bowl run, but now, Green Bay will have to move forward without its sack leader.\n            ",

Dart was able to return a few plays later, but it prompted more questions about how the Giants and interim coach Mike Kafka are protecting their franchise quarterback.On a first-and-goal play, Dart tried to run for a touchdown when he was met by Javon Kinlaw and Eddie Goldman, who make up a combined 639 pounds of defensive lineman. Dart left the field and took the well-trodden path to the blue injury tent.\nFortunately for the Giants, Dart was able to return for the fourth-down play, but the rookie quarterback has taken too many hits like that throughout the season. In November, Dart missed two games due to a concussion. Despite that -- and today's scare -- Kafka said the team won't change much about its offensive game plan.   \"We're not gonna change much in terms of how we play the game,\" Kafka said. \"I think just having the thought process for how we scheme it up. We had a couple opportunities where he's protected and he's got somebody in front of him. On that one particular play where he got out, that was a pass. I think there's not much you can do there. Of course we have his health, and everyone's health, in mind when we call plays.\"\nKafka added that Dart's mobility is one of his \"great strengths, and there's no denying that. Dart ran six times for 63 yards against the Commanders. It's just a matter of Dart recognizing when to protect himself.\"He knows,\" Kafka said. \"He's a smart football player. He knows when he needs to protect himself and when he needs to go make a play. I trust him to do that. That's probably the most important thing. The guys on the field trust him to do that.\"\nThe 2-12 Giants have three games remaining, and the team has been out of playoff contention for a while now. (New York does, however, at the moment, still own the top pick in the 2026 NFL Draft.) Keeping Dart healthy down the stretch should be a priority for New York, but it sounds like the team won't be holding him back on the ground.\n            \n    ",

And after the Colts' heartbreaking 18-16 loss to the Seahawks, the 44-year-old quarterback spoke on a stunning and inspiring comeback.\nThough Rivers didn't come back to inspire necessarily -- he came back to win -- he understands why that is one of the main takeaways.\"This isn't the motivation, but I think about my own boys, my own two sons, but certainly [that] high school team I'm coaching,\" Rivers said. \"This isn't why I'm doing it. Again, this is ... I know it comes with it, and I know it is a story, and I know it is rare, and all those things. But I wasn't searching. I was enjoying myself down there, being coach in South Alabama. These kinds of things don't come up. Obviously this doesn't come up every day.\"Maybe it will inspire or teach not to run or be scared of what may or may not happen.\"\nRivers, who has been coaching his son Gunner at Fairhope St. Michael Catholic, hoped his players could take away that their coach wasn't afraid to try.\"There is doubt, and it's real,\" Rivers said. \"The guaranteed safe bet is to go home, or to not go for it, and the other one is 'Shoot, let's see what happens.' I hope that in that sense that it can be a positive to some young boys, or young people, it doesn't have to be boys.\"Rivers, who completed 18 of 27 passes for 120 yards, one touchdown and one interception, put the Colts in position to win with a couple of key completions to set up Blake Grupe's go-ahead 60-yard field goal with under a minute left. However, Seattle got a 56-yard Jason Myers field goal on the ensuing drive. Rivers' final desperation pass of the game was intercepted.\nThat's not how he'll go out, though. As he noted, he'll turn his focus to a crucial Week 16 game Monday night against the 49ers. At 8-6, Indianapolis is still right in the thick of the playoff race, currently one game out of the No. 7 seed in the AFC.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Former Ohio State coach and multiple national champion Urban Meyer is sympathizing with the family of Sherrone Moore following his firing this week at Michigan, stemming from an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. Meyer says the conversation is independent of football after Moore was arrested and charged with felony home invasion and stalking after the ordeal.\"Last night, I said a prayer for that family. I mean, you've got three little girls,\" Meyer said on this week's The Triple Option Podcast. \"You've got a guy that was on top of the world a week ago. They're up 6-0 on the Buckeyes at home. And then, also, you wake up, and they're in this situation. Rivalries aside, this is all human element. \"Now, this is something that, from what you read, that's some serious stuff that went on. And just, all of a sudden, you start seeing the impact. Forget football. Who cares about football?''Moore, a 39-year-old married father of three, was terminated for cause following a university investigation that signaled a clear violation of policy. Michigan likely will be off the hook for nearly all of Moore's $14 million buyout since he was fired for cause.\nMeyer went 83–9 in nearly seven full seasons at Ohio State and was unbeaten against Michigan before stepping down in 2018. In 2021, he served as coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars for only 13 games before he was fired during a tumultuous season, that included missing a plane ride home after a road game, locker room issues and a former player accusing Meyer of kicking him during warmups. Meyer denied the incident, but the team fired him later that same day.Michigan finished 8-5 in Moore's debut season last fall before improving to 9-3 this year. The Wolverines had a chance to be in the final College Football Playoff discussion during rivalry weekend prior to a loss to the Buckeyes. Moore served a two-game suspension to start this season for his involvement in the sign-stealing scandal centered around Connor Stalions during the Jim Harbaugh era.\nAs it stands, Michigan is preparing for a Citrus Bowl appearance against Texas under interim coach Biff Poggi. Moore's last call with media prior to his firing was a call with reporters surrounding the Wolverines' postseason matchup and how many players were considering skipping the contest. Moore would not answer a question concerning NIL contract language involving certain Michigan players being incentivized to play in the game. He also said Michigan wouldn't know how many of its draft-eligible players would opt-out of the matchup in Orlando, but expected \"a lot more playing than not playing.\"\"We just really want guys that want to play in the game,\" Moore said. \"You don't want to have to promote people based on [if] they get rev share to play in the game. You want guys that just want to play football.\" \nJust under 72 hours later, Moore was fired and soon after detained by the Saline (Mich.) Police Department and turned over to police in Pittsfield Township prior to charges being filed. In the aftermath of Moore's firing, Michigan is now looking inward and the university's board of regents authorized a law firm to expand its investigation into the athletic department.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Alabama coach Kalen DeBoer ended all speculation Sunday afternoon alluding to potential interest in the Michigan vacancy with the Crimson Tide set to Oklahoma in the first round of the College Football Playoff next week. DeBoer was considered among the best fits for the Wolverines soon after Sherrone Moore's firing earlier this week.DeBoer was scheduled to meet with media on Monday, but released a statement ahead of that appearance.\"My family and I are very happy in Tuscaloosa and remain extremely grateful for the support of President Mohler, Greg Byrne, the board and so many others,\" DeBoer said through Yea Alabama, the Crimson Tide's NIL collective. \"We have an incredible opportunity in front of us, so my sole focus is on Alabama football and our preparations to play Oklahoma in the College Football Playoff. I have not spoken and have no interest in speaking with anyone else about any other job. I am fully committed to this program and look forward to continuing as the head football coach at the University of Alabama.\"In his second season with the Crimson Tide after taking Washington to the 2023 national championship game, DeBoer is 19-7 at Alabama, which faces Oklahoma in the first round of the College Football Playoff on Friday night.\n\"We are proud to have Coach DeBoer leading our football program at The University of Alabama,\" Crimson Tide athletic director Greg Byrne said in a statement. \"He is an incredible coach and does an excellent job with the development of our student-athletes, both on and off the field. Just as he is committed to this team, we are committed to him, and we look forward to taking the field Friday in the first round of the College Football Playoff.\"DeBoer's statement came after Ryan Williams and other players mentioned rumors on social media being difficult to avoid.\"Yeah, of course we see it on TV, but I mean, he's gave his best effort here,\" Williams said Friday. \"Focused on playing against Oklahoma, we're not really worried about it. ... I mean, at the end of the day, he serves us 100% and that's our coach, so we're going to play for him. External noise is external noise, so we just focus on the internal.\"\nThis isn't the first job opening this cycle where DeBoer's name immediately emerged. DeBoer denied previous speculation about the Penn State vacancy prior to the Nittany Lions' hiring of Matt Campbell, but had not addressed the Michigan situation until Sunday.DeBoer and the Crimson Tide's chief focus can now be on the Sooners after a previous loss to Oklahoma last month put Alabama in several playoff elimination games down the stretch. The Crimson Tide suffered three giveaways during that 23-21 setback in Tuscaloosa despite doubling Oklahoma in total yardage and largely dominating the contest.The Alabama-Oklahoma winner plays unbeaten and top-seeded Indiana at the Rose Bowl in the quarterfinals.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        For the eighth time in promotional history, the UFC will present a fight card on Saturday from Mexico City. And, for the fifth time since that relationship began, former two-time flyweight champion Brandon Moreno will be featured prominently on the card. Moreno (23-9-2), a native of Tijuana who now lives and trains out of Las Vegas, became the first Mexican-born champion in UFC history when he captured the promotion's 125-pound title by submitting Deiveson Figueiredo in 2021, which was their second of four title bouts against one another in the history of their exciting rivalry. The 32-year-old Moreno will look to return to title contention and bounce back from a December TKO loss to Tatsuro Taira when he headlines UFC Fight Night inside Arena CDMX in the proud nation's capitol city. Moreno, who will face late replacement Lone'er Kavanagh (9-1) will also be fighting with the plight of his people in mind following days of unrest throughout the country. On Sunday, the Mexican government announced the capturing and death of powerful cartel leader Nemesio Ruben Oseguera Cervantes, commonly known as \"El Mencho,\" which set off a wave of retaliatory violence in major cities. \n\"I was walking yesterday in the streets and I stopped to watch my cellphone at all the bad news around the country,\" Moreno told CBS Sports HQ on Monday. \"Right now, in Mexico City, things here are super calm. All of the disaster is more to the north like Guadalajara and Puerto Vallarta. Actually, my [home] city has reports of some destruction on the streets in Tijuana, that's the northwest. Thank life and thank God, my family is fine and the people all around me are fine. \"It has been really hard hours for my Mexican people. It's weird, man. It's crazy because, right now, I'm super focused on my fight but, at the same time, I know that a lot of Mexican people are focused on this bad moment. Maybe [the UFC Fight Night event] can be a nice moment for the people to try to forget the bad moment and get some joy.\"\nThe site of Saturday's card, in central Mexico, is located more than a six-hour drive away from the center of the unrest in the Mexican state of Jalisco, where citizens and tourists have been told to shelter in place. The U.S. State Department declared Tuesday that the majority of areas outside of Jalisco have \"returned to normal\" and UFC Fight Night will go on as scheduled. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Real Madrid will host Benfica on Wednesday at the Bernabeu after the eventful 1-0 win in Lisbon last week. The playoff's first leg was monopolised by the episode that involved Benfica midfielder Gianluca Prestianni and Vinicius Jr. Prestianni has been provisionally suspended by the UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body (CEDB) and will miss the second leg of the Champions League playoff against Real Madrid taking place on Wednesday at the Bernabeu. Prestianni has been at the center of a whirlwind centered around comments that he made to Madrid attacker Vinicius Junior after he scored the stunning and winning goal in Lisbon during the 1-0 win at the Estadio Da Luz. The game was interrupted for 10 minutes as Vini Jr. reported an alleged racial incident following comments from the Argentinian midfielder. According to multiple reports, Prestianni could potentially face a minimum 10-game ban from UEFA. Viewing informationDate: Wednesday, Feb. 25 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Bernabeu -- MadridLive stream: Paramount+Odds: Real Madrid -189; Draw +360; Benfica+455French referee Francois Letexier made a gesture of crossed arms above his head, an initiative adopted by FIFA in 2024 to allow players and officials to signal that they believe racist abuse has taken place on the field. Television cameras caught Benfica forward Gianluca Prestianni speaking to Vinicius with his jersey covering his mouth and the Real Madrid man appeared to subsequently make reference to that while speaking to Letexier. \n        \n            \n                Real Madrid superstar Vinicius Junior walks off field following alleged racist incident at Benfica\n                \n                    James Benge                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nPosting on his Instagram stories after the game, Vinicius said: \"Racists are, above all, cowards. They need to put their shirts over their mouths to demonstrate how weak they are. But they have, on their side, the protection of others who, theoretically, have the obligation to punish. Nothing that happened today is new in my life and my family's. I received a yellow card for celebrating a goal. I still don't understand why. On the other hand, just a poorly executed protocol that served no purpose. I don't like appearing in situations like this, even more so after a great victory and when the headlines have to be about Real Madrid, but it's necessary.\"\nBoth FIFA and UEFA, as well as multiple soccer personalities around the world, have condemned the episode, and the European governing body started an investigation into the matter. On Monday, ahead of the second leg that will take place at the Bernabeu on Wednesday, the UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body (CEDB) have confirmed the provisional suspension as investigations are still ongoing: \"Following the appointment of a UEFA Ethics and Disciplinary Inspector (EDI) to investigate allegations of discriminatory behaviour during the UEFA Champions League 2025/2026 Knock-out Play-off match between SL Benfica and Real Madrid CF on 17 February 2026, and upon request of the EDI with an interim report, the UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body (CEDB) today decided to provisionally suspend Mr. Gianluca Prestianni for the next (1) UEFA club competition match for which he would otherwise be eligible for the prima facie violation of Article 14 of the UEFA Disciplinary Regulations (DR) related to a discriminatory behaviour. This is without prejudice to any ruling that the UEFA disciplinary bodies may subsequently make following the conclusion of the ongoing investigation and its respective submission to the UEFA disciplinary bodies\". \nMourinho didn't speak ahead of the gameBenfica manager Jose Mourinho was at the center of criticism for his post-game remarks on the episode. The Special One also received a red card and will miss Wednesday's game and didn't attend the pre-match press conference ahead of the Real Madrid match. Speaking to the media after the first leg, Mourinho said, \"I told Vinicius Jr, when you score a goal like that, you just celebrate and walk back. When he was arguing about racism, I told him the biggest person in the history of this club [Eusebio] was black. This club, the last thing that it is, is racist.\"Multiple soccer personalities criticised Mourinho for his words. Bayern Munich coach Vincent Kompany, for example, described his words as a \"huge mistake.\" Kompany added, \"Mourinho basically attacked Vinicius Jr.'s character by discrediting the type of celebration he did. That was a huge mistake in terms of leadership and something we should not accept. Do you know what black players had to go through in the 60s? Was he there to travel with Eusebio for every away game and see what he went through? At the time, the only option Eusebio had was probably to be quiet, say nothing, and be ten times better just to get a little bit of credit,\" said Kompany during a press conference. Will Mbappe miss the second leg? Real Madrid star Kylian Mbappe might miss the return leg in Madrid due to a minor injury he suffered ahead of the game on Tuesday in training, as reported by multiple sources, including L'Equipe and Marca. According to the Spanish outlet, Mbappe will make the final decision on his involvement only before the match on Wednesday. \nArbeloa on Prestianni Speaking ahead of the match, Real Madrid coach Alvaro Arbeloa spoke on the matter of the episode between Prestianni and Vincius Jr: \"We haven't talked, and my opinion remains the same as last week. We are facing a great opportunity to make a significant step forward in the fight against racism. UEFA has always been a strong advocate in the fight against racism, and now they have the opportunity not to leave it as just a slogan or a nice banner before matches. I hope they seize this opportunity. We are very focused on tomorrow's match. We want to perform at a high level, present a great image, do things right on the field, and deliver a great performance to win the match. That is where we are putting all our energy and effort. The rest does not concern us. We are not the ones who have to make those kinds of decisions; that is up to UEFA.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Denver Broncos are coming off one of the best seasons in franchise history. They went 14-3, surging past the Kansas City Chiefs to win the AFC West and earn the No. 1 seed in the conference before falling a game short of a Super Bowl appearance. Still, coach Sean Payton is making a major change for 2026 in hopes of sparking the offense. Payton revealed Tuesday at the NFL Scouting Combine that he is giving up play-calling duties to new offensive coordinator Davis Webb. Payton called Webb \"extremely talented,\" and said this decision is best for the team. \"It was something I kind of knew during the year. He and I visited on a handful of occasions. He's extremely talented. With regards to play-calling, I think he'll be really good at it,\" Payton said. In 2025, Denver's offense ranked 14th in scoring (23.6 points per game) and 10th in total offense (342.6 yards per game), while second-year signal-caller Bo Nix completed 63.4% of his passes for 3,931 yards, 25 touchdowns and 11 interceptions. At face value, those numbers are pretty solid, but there was a reason why Denver fired offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi last month. The Broncos made a habit of putting pressure on themselves with slow starts. In fact, Denver registered 12 comeback wins this past season -- an NFL record.\nIt was evident all year. The Broncos played with their food in the season opener against the lowly Tennessee Titans in a 20-12 victory, and then lost their next two games. In Week 5, the Broncos had to score 18 unanswered points in the fourth quarter to defeat the Philadelphia Eagles, 21-17. Two weeks later, the Broncos came back from down 19-0 in the fourth quarter to defeat the New York Giants, 33-32. According to CBS Sports Research, those 33 points were the most scored in a game in NFL history by a team that was being shut out entering the fourth quarter. Broncos fans were left wondering why their offense waited until the final 15 minutes to start playing.Payton struggled to get Nix and his offense into a rhythm. It's easy to criticize the quarterback whenever the offense can't stay on the field, but some of Payton's third-down play calls were questionable, including in critical situations. Look no further than Denver's controversial decision to go for it on fourth-and-1 in the first half of the AFC Championship game instead of kicking a chip-shot field goal in an eventual three-point loss. Payton called a bootleg or play-action pass that was doomed from the start. He said afterwards that he regretted the play call more than the decision to go for it. The other facet of this decision is the promotion of Webb, who clearly has already earned the trust of Payton and Nix. \nWho is Davis Webb?The 31-year-old Webb spent the past three years as the Broncos' quarterbacks coach. He served as the team's pass game coordinator in 2025 as well. A former NFL quarterback himself, Webb was selected in the third round in 2017 by the Giants. However, he played in just two NFL games before turning his attention to coaching. Webb has experienced a meteoric rise in the coaching world. He received head-coaching interest from the Las Vegas Raiders, Buffalo Bills and Baltimore Ravens this offseason. Webb could have found a job as an offensive coordinator for another team, but the Broncos promoted him following Lombardi's firing and are now giving him play-calling duties.Longtime NFL backup quarterback Chase Daniel, who played for Payton in 2017 with the New Orleans Saints, had high praise for Webb.\n\"I can't fathom Sean Payton ever giving up play calling knowing how he operates,\" Daniel wrote. \"And that should tell you everything you need to know about Davis Webb.\"Payton said just as much. \"I would only do that [give up calling plays] if I felt like it would help our team,\" Payton said. \"I'll still be involved with what we do offensively, just like what we do defensively. But I do think [Webb] has a gift. He's real sharp. I'm glad he's on our staff. I'm looking forward to it.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        An outstanding six-year run for left tackle Trent Williams with the San Francisco 49ers could be in danger of coming to an end. With Williams set to carry a $39 million cap number in 2026, he and the 49ers are engaged in talks but are struggling to find a contractual solution to the sizable impact he will have on the team's payroll next season, according to ESPN. If the sides cannot find a middle ground, Williams could become a free agent this offseason.The 49ers want to keep their star tackle in town despite the reported stalemate, according to CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones. John Lynch, the team's general manager, effectively said as much Tuesday at the NFL Combine.\"In recent weeks, I've met with both Trent and with his agent, Vincent Taylor, and had really good, productive and substantive meetings,\" Lynch said. \"Here's what I know. Trent loves being a Niner. We love having Trent as a Niner. It's up to us to figure that out and to thread that needle.\"There's some unique circumstances in that we all know what Trent is as a player and how great of a player he's been. He's gonna be 38 years old, so there's some things that go into that. But I think we're all on the same page and feel very positively about where that's going.\"\n        \n            \n                Trent Williams landing spots: 49ers star would have plenty of suitors from Super Bowl contenders\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nA release before June 1 would save the 49ers $4.7 million in cap space. If they were to release him after that date, they would save $15.5 million this year -- though that would require them to split his dead cap hit across the 2026 and 2027 seasons.\nWilliams, a five-time All-Pro honoree and 12-time Pro Bowler, would be among the most highly sought-after players of the 2026 free agent class. Even entering his age-38 season, the veteran tackle remains a premier blind-side protector with potentially multiple more years left in the tank. He said last offseason that he would \"love to play until I'm 40.\"The 49ers and Williams agreed in September 2024 to a restructured three-year deal that made him the NFL's highest-paid offensive lineman that season.One of the few accolades that Williams has left to add to his résumé is Super Bowl champion. Remaining with the 49ers should allow him to achieve that goal, but his significant cap hit could also limit San Francisco's ability to surround him with enough talent to contend in a loaded NFC West. The 49ers secured a wild-card berth in 2025 despite finishing third in the division at 12-5. With two Super Bowl appearances and a pair of conference championship game berths since 2019, the 49ers are knocking on the door of a title. Losing one of the NFL's best tackles without getting anything in return would be a significant blow in that quest.\nWilliams joined the 49ers in 2020 via a trade with the Washington Commanders. The former No. 4 overall pick spent the first decade of his career in Washington and was a perennial Pro Bowler. He took his game to the next level upon arriving on the West Coast, securing three consecutive first-team All-Pro honors and a second-team selection in 2025.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The week of the NFL combine is when news starts to pick up again. It proves the NFL has no real offseason, and the closest thing to it is the two weeks between the Super Bowl and combine week.One of the biggest pieces of news was Tuesday's report from ESPN's Adam Schefter that Trent Williams and the 49ers are attempting to resolve their contract differences. Williams is set to count nearly $39 million against the cap in 2026, the 16th-highest figure in the NFL and the fourth-highest among non-quarterbacks, only behind Chiefs defensive lineman Chris Jones, 49ers defensive end Nick Bosa and Vikings wide receiver Justin Jefferson.The 49ers want Williams to return, and the player's representation and the team remain in contact. GM John Lynch said Tuesday, \"I think we're on the right track.\" Still, it's no guarantee.Williams is 37 and entering the final year of a three-year, $82.6 million deal he renegotiated ahead of the 2024 season. He remains one of the NFL's premier offensive linemen, making his 12th Pro Bowl and fifth All-Pro team last year. Pro Football Focus graded him as the No. 3 tackle in the NFL. He is integral to everything the 49ers do.\nIf he were to leave, he'd have ample suitors eagerly awaiting. Williams would have his pick, too. He'd be a free agent, and at this stage in his career, all that's missing among his many accolades is a Super Bowl ring. With that in mind, here are five spots he could land if he does indeed leave San Francisco.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Green Bay PackersThe Packers are set to let starting left Rasheed Walker leave in free agency. A former seventh-round pick, Walker has risen to become a solid if unspectacular left tackle, and he has not missed a game the last three seasons. He's in for a significant payday in a few weeks' time.Williams would represent a tremendous win-now upgrade for a win-now operation. The Packers have been among the league's youngest teams for multiple years, and while that core has emerged to form a contender, it's still missing a few true stars. Williams would be one. Last year, Walker was PFF's No. 53 tackle, and he committed nine penalties; Williams, again, was the No. 3 tackle, and he committed just four penalties.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Chicago BearsGoing from one NFC North team to another, the Bears have already shown a willingness to take big swings on their offensive line. Last offseason -- their first under Ben Johnson -- Chicago traded for guards Joe Thuney and Jonah Jackson and signed center Drew Dalman. Right tackle Darnell Wright has continued to improve.That leaves left tackle, where Braxton Jones entered the season as the starter but got hurt and was then benched and appeared in only six games. Ozzy Trapilo ruptured his patellar tendon in the playoffs and will likely miss most of the year. Johnson showed last year he isn't afraid to make bold moves to upgrade Caleb Williams' surroundings.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Dallas CowboysYes, the Cowboys being on this list is almost a given considering their propensity for being in the news, and, yes, they have massive financial hurdles to overcome. But with plenty of restructuring opportunities ahead -- most notably Dak Prescott and CeeDee Lamb -- they will work their way out of the financial hole they're currently in.\nNow for the fit. Left tackle Tyler Guyton, a 2024 first-round pick, struggled mightily in 2025 and has not inspired a ton of confidence through two seasons. Right tackle Terence Steele is a cut candidate. Add in that Williams is from Texas and, again, that the Cowboys are the Cowboys, and Dallas has to at least be on the radar, no matter how unlikely it may seem.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Pittsburgh SteelersThe Steelers show no signs of entering a rebuild, even though Mike Tomlin resigned this offseason and the team's starting quarterback if the season started today would be Mason Rudolph or Will Howard. Should Aaron Rodgers return and reunite with Mike McCarthy, Pittsburgh would again look like a reasonably high-floor, low-ceiling outfit.Williams could elevate that ceiling. He's still a very good mover in space, something that would serve Pittsburgh well given Rodgers' propensity to get the ball out quickly to running backs and tight ends. Pittsburgh's current left tackle, 2023 first-round pick Broderick Jones, missed six games last year and has been inconsistent when on the field.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Wild card: New England Patriots\"He's 22 years old. He's our left tackle,\" Mike Vrabel said of Will Campbell in the aftermath of the rookie's difficult postseason. \"He'll get better and get stronger. Moments where he played well ... there's plays he'd like to have back, but we're not moving Will to center or guard or tight end or anywhere else.\"Indeed, Campbell's struggles were on full display, especially in the Super Bowl. But he was also playing at less than 100% after midseason knee surgery. The No. 4 overall pick less than a year ago, Campbell played at a very solid level prior to the injury. One bad postseason -- as a rookie coming off an injury, no less -- doesn't mean he's doomed.On the other hand, Vrabel's comments came before a player like Williams was potentially available. New England has plenty to do to ensure it's not a one-and-done Super Bowl contender, and upgrading other parts of the offense is high up on that list. But New England has the budget to go big-game hunting, and Williams is a massive talent at a crucial position.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Indiana Pacers and Utah Jazz were recently hit with significant fines from the NBA for tanking, which has become one of the hot topics of debate this season with so many teams racing to the bottom ahead of a loaded 2026 NBA Draft class. The Jazz were fined $500,000 for \"conduct detrimental to the league\" for benching star players regularly for the fourth quarter in an effort to lose, while the Pacers were fined $100,000 for \"violating the Player Participation Policy\" when they rested Pascal Siakam and two other starters for a game against the Jazz -- including Aaron Nesmith. Unsurprisingly, Pacers coach Rick Carlisle didn't agree with the NBA's decision and went into detail on why during a radio appearance in Indianapolis on Tuesday. He told 107.5 The Fan about the league's call with the Pacers and how the NBA insisted Nesmith could have played without speaking to Nesmith or the Pacers' team doctors. \"Yeah, I put out a statement about it. I didn't agree with it,\" Carlisle said. \"There was a league lawyer that was doing the interview that kind of unilaterally decided that Aaron Nesmith, who had been injured the night before and couldn't hold the ball, should have played in the game, which just seems ridiculous. And during the interview process, I was not on it, but I heard details. We asked them if they wanted to talk to the doctors, our doctors about it, because it's something that was documented by our doctors and trainers. They said no, they didn't need to. They talked to their doctors who did not examine Aaron Nesmith, and we asked them if they wanted to talk to the kid, and they said no, they didn't need to. So this was shocking. This was shocking to me. And during the interview they also asked if we considered medicating him to play in a game when we were 30 games under .500. So I was very surprised. You know, obviously didn't agree with it. This is really the first time I've gone into any detail about it. But that was the deal. And so yeah, that was it.\" If the league did suggest Nesmith should play without consulting the doctors who examined him and insisted he should've been medicated to play in a game, that does seem like a significant overreach on the part of the NBA. \nIt does need to be noted that Carlisle wasn't on this call and heard these details secondhand -- surely from someone frustrated within the Pacers organization about the outcome of the call -- but if that is indeed how the conversation went, that feels like a problem with the NBA's process that they need to address. The NBA issued a statement on Tuesday denying Carlisle's claims. \"Coach Carlisle's description of the process that went into the decision to fine the Indiana Pacers is inaccurate,\" the league said in a statement. \"An independent physician led the medical review. In addition, the Pacers' General Manager and the team's Senior Vice President, Sports Medicine and Performance were interviewed as part of the process. The Pacers confirmed that it had provided all of the information requested by the league and the team reported that an interview with Coach Carlisle or a team physician wasn't necessary.\"The Nesmith injury being legitimate is certainly Indiana's most salient argument against the fine, but that seems like it was a more secondary concern to Siakam's absence for the NBA. Mostly, the Pacers ran into the issue of the league feeling significant pressure from the outside, including its media partners, to address tanking that feels more widespread and aggressive than we've seen in some time. \nWhile Indiana is understandably not happy with being singled out and hit with a $100,000 fine, that game with the Jazz -- which they lost -- was critical to the lottery race and if you gave the Pacers some truth serum, I bet they'd tell you it was worth the 100 grand. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Running back Breece Hall is scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent this offseason, but the New York Jets are adamant about keeping their top ballcarrier on the roster. If the sides cannot come to an agreement on a contract extension in the next week, general manager Darren Mougey said the Jets will use either a franchise tag or transition tag.Given the Jets' struggles last season and Hall's looming free agency, the four-year veteran was widely viewed as a prime candidate to be moved at the trade deadline. Instead, he stuck in New York and could be poised to play another year with the franchise that selected him with a second-round pick in 2022.\"The tags are an option,\" Mougey said at the NFL Combine. \"Ideally we'd find a way to get a deal done and keep Breece around. I think I've said that for the last year since I've got here. Breece is a good player. Want to find a way to keep him around. We've been going through that process and are still doing so. We have a week to find out -- if we can't get to an agreement -- which way we'll go with that tag.\"The deadline to use one of the tags is March 3. That gives the Jets one week to sign Hall to a new deal before paying $14.5 million on a franchise tag or $11.7 million on a transition tag.While a lack of team success throughout Hall's career leads to questions about whether the running back would be willing to re-sign with the Jets, Mougey said he believes there is mutual interest in sticking together. That suggests the sides could still get a deal done before March 3.\n\"I do get the sense that Breece wants to be here,\" Mougey said. \"We've had good conversations throughout the season, after the season. So just finding a way to do that.\"Hall would be among the NFL's top free agents if he hit the open market. Instead, signs point to him returning to the Meadowlands in some capacity. The most reasonable path to Hall landing on a different roster in 2026 is if the Jets use the transition tag on him, a running back-needy team extends an offer and New York declines to match.While the Jets have been mired in mediocrity since Hall's arrival in 2022, the Iowa State product remains a bright spot on the roster and one of the most valuable players around which New York could build. In the three years since a torn ACL halted a stellar rookie season, Hall has been a model of consistency, playing in all but two games and tallying at least 876 rushing yards and four touchdowns per season.\nHall is also among the most prolific receiving backs in the NFL. He is coming off his first 1,000-yard rushing season but did take a step backward as a receiver with 36 catches, 350 yards and one touchdown -- each representing personal lows for a full season.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Atlanta Falcons will not allow former No. 4 overall pick Kyle Pitts to hit free agency, placing the franchise tag on their star tight end.  Atlanta made Pitts the first NFL player to receive the tag this offseason shortly after new Falcons coach Kevin Stefanski was asked about the former Pro Bowler during the NFL Combine. While he didn't specifically discuss Pitts, Stefanski stressed how much he values his position. \"I love the position. I coached it. It was my first position to coach on the offensive staff, was tight ends there with the Vikings under coach (Mike) Zimmer,\" Stefanski told the assembled media. \"I love the position because of the versatility that it provides an offense. And you've seen it around the league. This is nothing new or earth-shattering, but tight ends that can line up all over make life hard on a defense. Whether you can line them up outside, in the backfield, in line, you name it, we love versatility at that position.\"Obviously, Kyle's somebody that we'll talk at length more about when it comes to those types of roster conversations, but the position itself is something that we feel really very strongly about.\"\nIt was expected Atlanta would place the franchise tag on Pitts as it works towards a new deal. The Falcons have until July 15 to sign Pitts to a contract. If he were to play on the tag in 2026, Pitts would make a fully-guaranteed $16,007,000, according to Spotrac. The Falcons are expected to have $26,462,519 in cap space, which ranks No. 15 in the NFL per Over The Cap. Jones also mentioned the possibility of Pitts being tagged and traded if there was a suitor that offered enticing-enough compensation. Atlanta's first selection in this upcoming draft comes at No. 48 overall.\nPitts was considered to be one of the top tight ends set to hit free agency, headlining a list that includes Travis Kelce, David Njoku, Isaiah Likely, Dallas Goedert, Cade Otton and Chig Okonkwo. Pitts is coming off a career year in which he caught 88 passes for 928 yards and five touchdowns. He delivered what was the best outing of his NFL career during a Week 15 prime-time victory against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, in which he caught 11 of 12 targets from Kirk Cousins for 166 yards and three touchdowns. The Florida product made the Pro Bowl in 2021 after becoming the first rookie tight end to cross 1,000 yards receiving since Mike Ditka in 1961, and was named a Second Team All-Pro this past season. In 78 career games played, Pitts has caught 284 passes for 3,579 yards and 15 touchdowns. \nPitts was recently the second reported player to be in line to receive the franchise tag, joining Dallas Cowboys wide receiver George Pickens. Running back Breece Hall of the New York Jets is another player to watch with intentions to use a franchise or transition tag if a deal cannot be reached by March 3. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        There are lots of ways to score points, but usually quarterback play, offensive line strength and dynamic playmakers are essential to building an explosive offense in college football. Indiana featured all three last year, riding the nation's No. 3 scoring offense all the way to a historic College Football Playoff National Championship. They weren't alone, though, with seven CFP teams ranking No. 32 or better in points per game in 2025. So while it's not a guarantee of success, fielding an offense that can score points at will provides a definitive advantage and a leg up in a landscape growing more competitive by the day. Coming out of the 2026 recruiting and transfer portal cycle, some teams appear better equipped than others to light up the scoreboard next season.Here's a projection of which college football teams could field the most explosive offenses in 2026:\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. TexasTexas added Auburn wide receiver Cam Coleman along with running backs Hollywood Smothers (NC State) and Raleek Brown (Arizona State) to help reshape the offense for 2026. The Longhorns won bidding battles for Coleman and Smothers, who combined for 12 touchdowns at their previous stops last season.Arch Manning is coming off the best outing of his career after outdueling Michigan's Bryce Underwood in the Citrus Bowl, a postseason showing that mirrored the second-half surge that accelerated his development. If Manning takes another step, this Texas offense could rival the best of the Sarkisian era on the Forty Acres -- a stretch that already includes consecutive CFP semifinal appearances.Like other elite programs that are a grenade-pin pull away from another level in 2026, everything starts up front for Texas. The Longhorns have reloaded with a bevy of highly rated portal additions who will flourish only if Manning has time to operate. If Texas controls the line of scrimmage, the pieces are in place for this SEC power to stress opposing defenses behind elite play-caller Steve Sarkisian and a rising star at quarterback.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. MiamiAssuming the Hurricanes overcome the loss of four impact starters along the offensive line, Miami should continue generating explosive plays and scoring at a rapid pace next fall. The arrival of Duke transfer quarterback Darian Mensah -- along with his top target Cooper Barkate and former South Carolina slot receiver Vandrevius Jacobs -- gives Shannon Dawson flexibility and eases the burden on Malachi Toney.Targeted heavily down the stretch of his freshman season, Toney set a single-season program record with 109 receptions.Veteran running backs Mark Fletcher Jr. and Jordan Lyle also return. Three of Fletcher's six 100-yard performances came over the final four games, when Lyle was limited by injury.\nProjecting ahead, Mario Cristobal's likely starting offensive line could include Matthew McCoy, Samson Okunlola, SJ Alofaituli, Jamal Meriweather and five-star freshman tackle Jackson Cantwell -- the No. 2 overall prospect in the 2026 class. If that group controls the line of scrimmage the way Miami did in 2025, the Hurricanes could be borderline unstoppable offensively.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. IndianaAfter leading the Big Ten in scoring offense each of the past two seasons, expectations may be bordering on unrealistic entering Curt Cignetti's third year. Fresh off a national championship, Indiana must replace a Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback, its top two running backs, leading receivers Elijah Sarratt and Omar Cooper Jr., and three offensive line starters.Few programs, however, are better positioned to absorb that level of change. Indiana's recent success has been driven by player development and precise scheme execution.\nCignetti has tabbed TCU transfer Josh Hoover as the replacement for Fernando Mendoza. Boston College transfer Turbo Richard adds explosiveness to the run game, while Michigan State's Nick Marsh and Tulane's Shazz Preston join Charlie Becker to reshape the receiving corps.The mentality up front is not expected to change. Whether the Hoosiers maintain their edge -- and the offensive efficiency that has defined this run -- will be determined quickly at the line of scrimmage.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Ohio StateRyan Day's decision to hire former NFL coach Arthur Smith as offensive coordinator has drawn mixed reviews, much of which is tied to Smith's results at the professional level. The college game presents a different equation, however, particularly when elite programs can overwhelm opponents with superior talent. That setting could allow Smith to thrive.\nAt Ohio State, Smith is expected to employ a streamlined, run-oriented approach while creating calculated downfield opportunities for Jeremiah Smith and others. Quarterback Julian Sayin ranked among the nation's most efficient passers as a redshirt freshman, and a significant leap is anticipated from the Heisman hopeful.Despite transfer portal losses at wide receiver, the Buckeyes remain loaded at the position, highlighted by the additions of five-star prospects Chris Henry Jr. and Jerquaden Guilford. Smith, Devin McCuin and Brandon Innis are projected starters, with Bo Jackson back at tailback.Solidifying the offensive line rotation looms as a key offseason priority. Day has emphasized the need to play at least eight linemen with positional versatility, underscoring the importance of depth and flexibility up front.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. OregonNo program in the country owns a better quarterback situation than the Ducks after Dante Moore's decision to skip the 2026 NFL Draft and return to school. Nebraska transfer Dylan Raiola is behind him, along with a couple of guys the coaching staff feels great about in Akili Smith Jr. and Brock Thomas. As freshmen last season, Jordon Davison and Dierre Hill Jr. showed out in the backfield and are anxious to take on featured roles. The biggest loss on offense is tight end Kenyon Sadiq -- a projected first-rounder. Jamari Johnson will get the first crack at matching his production at the position. Dakorien Moore, Jeremiah McClellan and Evan Stewart return as featured options at wideout. There might be slight statistical drop off with elite offensive coordinator Will Stein taking over at Kentucky, but Oregon has proved annually under Dan Lanning that this offense is a tough one to contain.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Notre DameThere will be no Jeremiyah Love or Jadarian Price to rescue the offense when needed next season, but Fighting Irish offensive coordinator Mike Denbrock has little reason to panic. After losing the first two starts of his career, C.J. Carr responded with 10 consecutive wins, finishing with 2,741 yards and 24 touchdowns. He was tied for No. 2 in the country in yards per attempt (9.4) and fifth in passer rating (168.06).\nAneyas Williams is expected to receive the first reps at running back, though Notre Dame could opt for a committee approach in 2026.Ohio State transfers Mylan Graham and Quincy Porter join a talented group of pass-catchers that includes Jaden Greathouse and Jordan Faison, who led the team in receptions and receiving yards as a junior.And if there is one position group Notre Dame rarely worries about, it is the offensive line. The Fighting Irish are consistently well-coached up front and typically set the tone in the trenches. With a favorable schedule ahead, this offense should post significant numbers throughout 2026.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. LSUWhen you assemble the nation's top-ranked transfer portal class and commit every available resource to making Year 1 under Lane Kiffin a success, the expectation is immediate production.In addition to landing former Arizona State quarterback Sam Leavitt, Kiffin added USC signal-caller Husan Longstreet and overhauled LSU's wide receiver room with 12 newcomers. The offensive line also projects as a major strength, anchored by five-star Colorado transfer Jordan Seaton. That unit must improve after uneven play last fall, when the Tigers struggled at times to protect Garrett Nussmeier and failed to meet lofty preseason expectations.Tight end Trey'Dez Green returns as a proven playmaker, and Harlem Berry -- the No. 1 running back in the 2025 recruiting cycle -- opted to remain with the program to see what Kiffin and his staff can build.\nKiffin engineered a rapid offensive turnaround at Ole Miss with tempo and efficiency. He will attempt to replicate that formula in Baton Rouge after bringing offensive coordinator Charlie Weis Jr. and several assistants with him.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    8. Texas TechTexas Tech's CFP shutout loss to Oregon left a bitter taste inside the program, a stark offensive failure that set the offseason narrative. Coach Joey McGuire quickly identified and addressed his offensive needs needs during this transfer portal cycle, adding Cincinnati quarterback Brendan Sorsby and four wide receivers, including two from Power Four programs. Another strong portal class positions Texas Tech to compete for a Big 12 championship and a playoff berth -- provided the offense performs at a high level, especially given personnel losses on defense. In 2025, the Red Raiders often leaned on their defense to make plays, a luxury they may not have next fall.Optimism rests partly on a talented backfield anchored by returning contributors Cameron Dickey, J'Koby Williams and Quinten Joyner, who will be counted on to lift the offense next season.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    9. Ole MissWith quarterback Trinidad Chambliss receiving an injunction to play a sixth season, the Rebels look like a juggernaut in 2026. Auburn transfer Deuce Knight was once an insurance policy, set to take over under center if Chambliss' court challenge fell through. Now he'll be a luxury. Retaining college football's most potent running back also helps after Kewan Lacy stiff-armed the pursuit from LSU and Kiffin to stay with the Rebels. He's a 1,400-yard rusher who scored an SEC-leading 23 touchdowns last fall.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    10. Oklahoma StateEric Morris fielded the nation's top total offense (512 yards per game) and scoring average (45.1 points) at North Texas last year. Transitioning from the Group of Six to the Power Four presents a new challenge, but Morris's system is proven -- and he persuaded his two best North Texas players to follow him.Oklahoma State could emerge as college football's most-improved team thanks to Morris and a top-10 transfer class, highlighted by quarterback Drew Mestemaker and tailback Caleb Hawkins. The Cowboys are poised for multiple high-scoring Big 12 shootouts, with plenty of fireworks and eye-popping numbers expected from their all-conference-caliber offensive talent.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Miami (Ohio) continued its storybook ride on Tuesday night, as the No. 21 RedHawks improved to 28-0 with a 74-64 win at Eastern Michigan. The win brought Miami within three victories of becoming the first Division I men's college basketball team to finish the regular season undefeated since Gonzaga went 24-0 during the COVID-impacted 2020-21 season. By contrast, Miami's regular-season slate features 31 games. While the RedHawks' schedule has been one of the easiest in college basketball, starting 28-0 is nonetheless a remarkable achievement. It's also a reflection of the program's steady rise under fourth-year coach Travis Steele. After finishing 12-20 and 6-12 in the MAC in 2022-23 during Steele's first season, the RedHawks have steadily improved in every season since. A year ago, they finished 25-9 and 14-4 in the MAC, suffering a devastating loss to Akron in the MAC Tournament title game. Steele managed to retain a significant chunk of last season's roster, which makes Miami a rarity in the mid-major ranks.  With continuity and experience in place, the RedHawks have navigated every challenge thus far. However, due to their poor schedule strength — the RedHawks haven't even played a Quad 1 game — their status in the NCAA Tournament field will be up for debate if they fail to win the MAC Tournament. \nThough Miami has played zero Quad 1 games and is just 1-0 in Quad 2, there is a metric on official NCAA team sheets that acknowledges the brilliance of its undefeated start. It's called Wins Against Bubble (WAB), and it calculates how the average bubble team would perform against your schedule. With a WAB score of 2.16 as of Feb. 22, the RedHawks rank 35th in WAB and are recognized for having over two more victories than the average bubble team would against their slate.  Up next for Miami The remaining schedule for Miami which is trying to become the first team since Indiana accomplished the feat in the 1975-76 season. \nFridayat Western Michigan6 p.m. CBS Sports NetworkTuesdayvs. Toledo7 p.m. ESPN+March 6at Ohio7 p.m. CBS Sports NetworkMarch 12-14MAC Tournament (Cleveland)TBD If Miami doesn't win the MAC Tournament and needs an at-large ticket to the Big Dance, WAB will be one of its best friends. Its current 35th ranking is within at-large territory. Where it gets tricky is that any loss against MAC opposition carries a significant WAB penalty. Here are all the Selection Sunday scenarios for Miami as it heads down this the stretch with its first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2007 in sight.  NCAA Tournament selection scenarios for Miami   The simple scenario (win MAC Tournament)  Record: Between 31-3 and 34-0  Confidence level: It's a party Likely WAB range: Doesn't matter \nBust out the balloons and hire a caterer for the watch party. Miami can go 3-0 to close the regular season, 0-0 or something in between. It doesn't matter, so long as the RedHawks are cutting down the nets inside Cleveland's Rocket Arena at the end of the MAC Tournament on March 14.  Winning the MAC Tournament is the only 100% guaranteed path to the Big Dance, and it won't be easy. The MAC isn't one of the handful of conferences now offering automatic byes to the semifinals for its top two seeds. The RedHawks will have to win three games in three days against a field consisting exclusively of the league's top eight teams. Many of the players on this Miami team were part of a gutting 76-74 loss to Akron in last year's MAC Tournament title game in which the Zips rallied late to stun the RedHawks. That should only provide more motivation as Miami seeks its first conference tournament title since 2007. \n The MAC Madness scenario Selection Sunday record: 31-1, 32-1 or 33-1 Confidence level: Feeling optimistic Likely WAB range: 37-43 Miami could still feel reasonably hopeful about making the Big Dance if it entered the MAC Tournament 31-0 and then dropped a game. While on some level it could matter who the loss came against, the RedHawks would still enter Selection Sunday with a WAB ranking in the at-large realm, regardless of who was responsible for handing them their first defeat. A loss on a neutral floor in the MAC Tournament would likely come with a WAB cost of around 0.80. If Miami lost 0.80 in WAB today, it would drop the RedHawks  from the low-to-mid 30s in the metric to the low 40s. \nThe team with the best WAB ranking left out of last year's field was West Virginia, which arrived at Selection Sunday at No. 43 in the WAB. The 2025 selection process was the first to utilize WAB, so there isn't a trove of past precedents to rely upon. But WVU's exclusion last year sets a benchmark for Miami to aim for: don't fall to No. 43. Finishing the regular season undefeated and then losing in the MAC Tournament would likely be good enough to keep the RedHawks around or just below that figure, which would be enough for them to enter Selection Sunday with some cautious optimism.  Double-defeat scenario Selection Sunday record: 30-2, 31-2 or 32-2 Confidence level: Feeling nervous Likely WAB range: 43-52 \nThe double-defeat scenario involves Miami losing one regular-season game, in addition to a MAC Tournament game.  This would not be advisable, as it would likely lead to Miami's Selection Sunday WAB ranking landing in the mid-40s, at best. However, in this scenario, the opponent for the conference tournament loss could make a difference. If it's a high-end Quad 2 loss against Akron in the title game, then it would be less costly. The team with the worst WAB ranking selected to last year's field was Xavier, which was among the Last Four In at No. 49 in WAB. However, the Musketeers counterbalanced their lagging resume metrics with a predictive metrics profile hovering around 40th nationally.  \nMiami University does not have good predictive metrics to fall back upon. So slipping out of the low-to-mid 40s in WAB would make things dicey. If Miami loses twice, a slip of that magnitude is likely, and it would make Selection Sunday uncomfortable.  Three-loss scenario Selection Sunday record: 29-3, 30-3, 31-3 Confidence level: Better brace for disappointment Likely WAB range: 50-60 A 1-2 finish to the regular season, combined with a loss in the MAC Tournament, would decimate Miami's at-large chances. In this scenario, the best conceivable outcome would be that the RedHawks  lose in the MAC Tournament title game against Akron in a heartbreaking way that tugs on the heartstrings of committee members. But it would be a tough case to make.  \nWith three losses on its ledger, Miami would almost certainly lag behind other bubble teams in resume metrics. Remember, it's not just about win-loss record. It's about the totality of your resume. WAB does a good job of quantifying that, and it wouldn't be on Miami's side if the RedHawks  lost three times. \n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Virginia quarterback Chandler Morris filed a lawsuit against the NCAA in search of a seventh year of eligibility, his agent tells CBS Sports' Chris Hummer. Morris filed the suit in a Virginia state court after the NCAA denied his request for an eligibility waiver in January.The basis of Morris' waiver request was that he sustained injuries at TCU in 2022 and 2023, and he argued that he should have qualified for medical redshirts in both campaigns. Morris played four games in 2022 and seven games in 2023 after utilizing a redshirt in 2021. His 2020 season at Oklahoma did not count toward his eligibility clock because of a one-time waiver granted to all athletes due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Morris stayed healthy each of the last two seasons and played full campaigns at North Texas and Virginia. He led the American conference in passing yards (3,774) and touchdowns (31) in 2024 and transitioned nicely to the ACC, where he guided Virginia to the first 11-win season in program history and a berth in the conference championship game.If the court grants Morris relief against the NCAA's eligibility rules, he could return to Virginia in search of College Football Playoff contention. The Cavaliers climbed as high as No. 14 in last season's CFP Top 25 rankings and would have secured an automatic berth into the bracket had they defeated Duke in the ACC title game.\nMorris's suit against the NCAA is the latest example of an athlete attempting to use the court system to gain additional eligibility. These cases have largely defined the early portion of the college football offseason, and athletes found mixed results.A Mississippi judge granted Ole Miss quarterback Trinidad Chambliss a temporary injunction that will allow him to spend another season with the Rebels on the heels of a stellar debut campaign as one of the SEC's top signal-callers. Chambliss made a similar petition to Morris, stating that he was physically unable to compete in 2022 due to a respiratory condition.\nTennessee quarterback Joey Aguilar, meanwhile, was denied injunctive relief in a ruling that served as a major victory for the NCAA. Aguilar's case was different from the others, as he argued that his years spent in junior college should not count against his NCAA eligibility clock. That was the argument former Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia used to gain an additional year in a landmark case last offseason.\n            \n",

It has been a strange season with Balogun underperforming his expected goals despite his performances in these moments, but he's only 24 and not yet in his prime. With the 2026 World Cup drawing closer by the day, where Balogun is expected to lead the line for the United States men's national team, it's only a good thing for both Monaco and USMNT manager Mauricio Pochettino to see Balogun performing at this level in the biggest matches. There will only be more pressure on him as the year goes on, but he's rising to the occasion.\nGreat at turning good chances into shooting opportunities, Balogun will be able to take advantage of PSG's injury issues to make things happen in the match.\n                                                                    CBS Sports\n                                                            Luis Enrique's Parisians will be without Ousmane Dembele and Fabian Ruiz, who are critical members of the side. Dembele has been in and out of the XI this season after securing the Ballon d'Or, and that is a large reason why PSG aren't leading Ligue 1 like they'd expect to at this stage. After winning the Champions League for the first time in their history last campaign, PSG are among the top contenders to do so again, but overcoming injuries to key players after a long season that saw them make the Club World Cup final isn't an easy task. \nFacing another Ligue 1 side, PSG have additional familiarity, similar to when they faced Brest in the knockouts last year, but it also means that Monaco know what to expect. Only time will tell if returning home will give PSG an advantage in the match, but if they give Monaco an inch, Balogun will score, and an early goal could change everything in the clash between these two sides.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Half of the teams in the knockout stage have now booked their places in the Champions League round of 16, as Atletico Madrid, Newcastle United, Bayer Leverkusen, and Bodo/Glimt will enter Friday's draw to see their opposition in the next round. While Newcastle's tie was essentially determined in the first leg, there was more jeopardy on the line in the remaining fixtures with Norwegian side Bodo/Glimt booking their first-ever Champions League round of 16 berth following former Milan player Jens Petter Hauge taking advantage of Jan Sommer spilling the ball. \nFor Cristian Chivu and Inter, it's a disappointing result to say the least, and one that will be tough to bounce back from in Serie A play. Inter have arguably suffered the biggest upset in Champions League knockout history, and the Norwegian side will look forward to facing either Manchester City, who they've already beaten, or Sporting CP in the next stage. Earlier, Alexander Soloroth took center stage with a hat trick to put Atletico Madrid through to the round of 16, where they'll face either Liverpool or Tottenham, but American Johnny Cardoso also had the deciding goal. As Cardoso pushes for regular playing time in Diego Simeone's side and a place at the World Cup with the United States men's national team, scoring screamers from outside the box will help with that.Newcastle United, despite coming in with a five-goal lead on aggregate, wasted no time eliminating any chance of drama in their match with two goals in seven minutes of play from Sando Tonali and Joelinton. Qarabag made things interesting, scoring a few goals, but it was too little too late while Bayer Leverkusen held the line keep Olympiacos from scoring and professionaly see out their own passage to the round of 16.\nTuesday's Champions League scoresAtlético Madrid 4, Club Brugge 1 (7-4 Atlético Madrid on aggregate)Bayer Leverkusen 0, Olympiacos 0 (2-0 Bayer Leverkusen on aggregate)Inter 1, Bodo/Glimt 2 (5-2 Bodo/Glimt on aggregate)Newcastle United 3, Qarabag 2 (9-3 Newcastle on aggregate)Wednesday's Champions League schedule All times Eastern, all matches available on Paramount+Atalanta vs. Borussia Dortmund, 12:45 p.m.Juventus vs. Galatasaray, 3 p.m. PSG vs. Monaco, 3 p.m.Real Madrid vs. Benfica, 3 p.m.The Norwegian jobInter may have been without Lautaro Martinez facing Bodo/Glimt, but they had no issues creating chances with left back Federico Dimarco pulling the strings. They took a whopping 30 shots, though most didn't come from good positions, with Inter averaging an expected goals per shot of only 0.07 in this loss. It's something that signifies that the absence of midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu may have been the biggest miss for Inter while trying to break down a disciplined Bodo defense. As each shot and corner was defended, it only gave the Norwegian side more confidence before they were able to break the tie open in the second half with the help of mistakes from Inter.\n                                                                    CBS Sports\n                                                            With the Norwegian Eliteserien not returning to regular play until March due to the weather in the nation, all of Bodo's focus is on doing the best that they can in the Champions League. Usually, that would be seen as a disadvantage, but after four consecutive wins, taking out Manchester City, Atletico Madrid, and Inter Milan twice, no one can look past Bodo/Glimt, and a large reason for that is not only the system that manager Kjetil Knutsen has put together, but also the scorching form that Petter Hauge is in. If you want to see what confidence looks like on a chart, look no further than the Champions League matches (including qualifiers) that he has taken part in over the last two seasons.\n                                                                    CBS Sports\n                                                            Bodo's best performances have come alongside Petter Hauge taking over, and there's no reason that they can't keep this rolling further through this competition. They may be treated as underdogs, but the title should be shed after the teams that they've taken out along the way. The knockouts are usually when underdog stories come to an end, which is a detriment to Champions League play, so the longer Bodo's story can go, the better for all parties — except maybe Inter. \nAmericans keep it goingMalik Tillman and Cardoso have booked their places in the round of 16 in very different ways. Tillman missed out for Leverkusen with an ankle injury, but he has played a role in their Champions League success with two goals in eight appearances. He's still trying to lock down a regular role in the squad under Kasper Hjulmand, but when available, Tillman has been an improtant createive part of the side. For Cardoso, what better time to score his first Champions League goal with an effort from outside the box? Like Tillman, he has struggled with injuries this season, but with Conor Gallagher's move to Tottenham during the winter transfer window, the door is wide open for Cardoso to secure a starting role for Atleti while also pushing for one with the USMNT. \nCardoso's goal is impressive, but so is his resilience. After losing his man on Club Brugge's equalizer at the end of the first half, Cardoso had a short memory and got the go-ahead goal while playing a great match, breaking up Brugge attacks with five interceptions and taking a few shots. He's not a midfielder who is going to jump off the page, but you can see why Diego Sieone sees a place for him in the heart of this midfield. Cardoso doesn't need to make a ton happen going forward due to the strength of the wingers, but against such a dynamic side as Brugge, his ability to break up play was critical, and more will be needed in the round of 16.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The U.S. men's national team's Johnny Cardoso scored his first-ever goal in the UEFA Champions League on Tuesday, his impactful strike serving as a go-ahead goal for Atletico Madrid in their 4-1 win over Club Brugge, the tie ending with Madrid winning 7-4 on aggregate.Cardoso's goal gave Atleti a 2-1 lead on the day and a 5-4 advantage on aggregate, putting the Spanish side ahead in the tie early in the second. The play began when Giuliano Simeone received the ball from Marc Pubill, Simeone then making his way down the left flank and sitting on the edge of the penalty area before whipping a cross towards the far post. Brugge's Brandon Mechele was on the receiving end and headed the ball away, which Cardoso ran towards outside the box.The midfielder first controlled the ball with his head and sent it to his feet before letting it take a bounce, finally hitting the ball as it came back up. His powerful strike sailed through traffic and past Brugge goalkeeper Simon Mignolet before landing in the back of the net.Watch the strike below.\nHis goal ensured the knockout tie would eventually tip fully in Atleti's favor, with Alexander Sorloth completing a hattrick in the final 15 minutes of play after scoring the game's opening goal in the 23rd minute.\nIt is both Cardoso's first goal in the Champions League and his first since joining Atleti in the summer, and comes at a very important juncture in his season. He has just 19 appearances for the Spanish club after dealing with a series of injuries but has regularly played in the new year, building match fitness as final preparation is underway for players and coaches alike ahead of the World Cup co-hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico.Cardoso is a USMNT hopeful with 22 caps, but just as injuries have disrupted the early months of his time with Atleti, he has been out of the national team fold for several months. He was last with the group during their run to the Concacaf Gold Cup final, but he played only 11 total minutes during the competition, all in the group stage, as fitness issues hampered his ability to take part in the rest of the tournament.Cardoso boosts World Cup chancesCardoso's uptick in form is the latest in a bundle of good news for USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino in recent weeks, with midfielder Tyler Adams and forward Ricardo Pepi recently making their way back to the pitch after sustaining injuries early this winter. It means that Pochettino will likely have his entire player pool available for selection ahead of March's friendlies against Belgium and Portugal, and the U.S.' final matches before the World Cup roster will be finalized in late May. Regular minutes at the club level are a prerequisite for Pochettino as he makes his squad selections, and for Cardoso, his playing time with Atleti will prove crucial as the countdown to the World Cup continues. For a young player who has been unlucky with injuries, his outings with Atleti will help him make his World Cup case, illuminating his strengths as a player and demonstrating a level of usefulness to the national team ahead of an all-important tournament.\nCardoso is not regarded for his passing ability, average at best amongst defensive midfielders in LaLiga. He makes up the difference in a handful of other categories, though – he handles the more rugged parts of the job well, ranking in the 93rd percentile for tackles and 96th when compared to other players in his position in Europe's top five leagues. Though his goalscoring abilities are a smaller part of his game, his attacking skills are also impressive for a deep-lying player; the combination of his skills was on full display against Brugge. The goal is the highlight of his performance, but he completed two recoveries before the final whistle, each of them important as Brugge chased an equalizer that never came.The 24-year-old, though, can be mistake-prone at times. He was the Atleti player marking Joel Ordonez's goal in the first half, a step behind the opponent as Pubill's attempted deflection landed on the Brugge player's head instead. Cardoso's poor passing ability was also on display in one of the USMNT's pre-Gold Cup friendlies against Turkiye, a potential foe in the World Cup group stage, providing a perfect opening for Arda Guler to score the equalizer before a 2-1 defeat for Pochettino's side.\nHe will need to work to cut that element out of his game as he reaches his peak years, perhaps resigning him to a spot on the USMNT's bench at the World Cup should he make the cut. It likely puts him behind Adams in the pecking order; the Bournemouth midfielder is essentially the U.S.'s longtime favored player in that position. Even during a few injury-filled years himself after the 2022 World Cup, no one has ever gotten close to filling Adams' void or trying to unseat him in the process. There is unlikely room for them to share the pitch, either – Cardoso and Adams have not started a match together since Pochettino took over, though the sample size is small considering both of them have been in and out of the squad through injury.\nPochettino's midfield continues to shift as the head coach experiments with his options, handing a wide variety of players a chance to impress in national team colors in his 16 months on the job. Cardoso has thrust his name into the conversation but he will have a few rivals for a limited number of roster spots, a list of names that includes the likes of Lyon's Tanner Tessman and the Vancouver Whitecaps' Sebastian Berhalter.\n            ",

A multi-time winner, Chris Gotterup has jumped into a new echelon of golf. World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler has kept up his torrid pace, while Justin Rose has continued to defy conventional wisdom at age 45. Collin Morikawa broke his winless drought, and Jacob Bridgeman became the year's initial first-time winner at the Genesis Invitational by holding off Rory McIlroy. But that was the West Coast Swing, and now, the PGA Tour transitions to Florida with the 2026 Cognizant Classic representing the start of four weeks of golf in the Sunshine State. While the names that were supposed to headline the field -- Bridgeman, Ben Griffin and Adam Scott -- bowed out earlier in the week, opportunity still comes knocking at PGA National.A life-changing moment could be in a young player's future as a wide-open field battles the Bear Trap, which has lost some of its teeth in recent times. With tournament officials choosing to overseed the golf course to provide lush fairways and green scenery, the bite that the venue was once known for has been taken away. Last season, for example, Jake Knapp fired a 59 on the par 71 while Joe Highsmith won the tournament at 19 under after making the cut on the number. The year prior, Austin Eckroat won on a Monday finish at 17 under, marking the first time since the tournament moved to PGA National that a winner eclipsed 15 under.\nThis season, good scores should be available once again as Shane Lowry leads a group of veteran players like Keith Mitchell and Brooks Koepka into the field. Meanwhile, young players like Rasmus Højgaard and his twin brother Nicolai look for their first wins on the PGA Tour alongside Michael Thorbjornsen, Rasmus Neergaard-Petersen and Haotong Li, who are also in the mix.2026 Cognizant Classic scheduleDates: Feb. 26 - Mar. 1Location: PGA National Resort (The Champion Course) — Palm Beach Gardens, FloridaPar: 71 | Yardage: 7,223 | Architect: Tom FazioPurse: $9,600,0002026 Cognizant Classic field, oddsOdds via FanDuel Sportsbook\nShane Lowry (14-1): Despite contending regularly on the PGA Tour, Lowry is without an individual victory on U.S. soil since the WGC Bridgestone Invitational in 2015 -- a tournament that no longer exists ...  heck, an event series that no longer exists! He had a great opportunity to get off the schneid in 2022 when he fell just short to Sepp Straka at this tournament, which kicked off a run of four straight top 11 finishes at PGA National.

The young New Englander grabbed the solo lead late at TPC Scottsdale thanks to an eagle, but he then learned the hard way how difficult it is to close out a tournament on the PGA Tour and instead settled for a podium finish. He acquitted himself nicely at PGA National in his debut last season, where he was unable to find his groove on the greens.Keith Mitchell (27-1)Brooks Koepka (30-1): The Florida kid gets to play in his backyard once again. Nearly a winner at this event the year Mitchell holed a putt on the 72nd hole to hold off both Koepka and Rickie Fowler, Koepka returns this week to make his first start in the tournament since 2022, when he finished T16. The five-time major champion's return to the PGA Tour produced a couple of lackluster starts, but the bones of the operation were solid. Koepka kept up with his peers from tee to green only to be undone by his woeful performance on the greens. With the switch to Bermuda grass out in front of him and the rest of the PGA Tour, he should benefit.Christiaan Bezuidenhout (30-1)Rasmus Neergaard-Petersen (30-1): American golf fans, get used to hearing this name as the Rasmanian Devil continues to get his feet underneath him in his first PGA Tour season. The young Dane has only played twice on the PGA Tour in 2026 and made both cuts, but he should be frisky in a field of this caliber. Neergaard-Petersen won the Australian Open at Royal Melbourne to end 2025 and has continued to strike the ball beautifully in 2026.Aaron Rai (33-1): Was a surprise addition to the proceedings at the Genesis Invitational as Rai got off to a rocky start to his 2026 at venues that should fit his skillset (Waialae Country Club and Pebble Beach). Among the leaders early in the week, the Englishman unfortunately backtracked on Sunday at Riviera outside the top 25, but he showed enough promise to be feeling good heading into this week.2026 Cognizant Classic picks\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Ryan Gerard\n                    \n            \n            \n        \nWinner (16-1): He was the breakout candidate in the preseason predictions, and while Gotterup and Bridgeman may have the inside track on that award early, Gerard should give them a good push across the Florida events. Despite the lacking results to this point, the 26-year-old continued to strike the cover off the golf ball at Pebble Beach and Riviera, only to be undone on the greens.

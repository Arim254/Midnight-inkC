    "body": "\n        Team USA just ended its 46-year gold medal drought in men's hockey, and so now the task shifts to defending the title. With a deep talent pool, the Americans should be the favorites to win gold at the 2030 Winter Olympics, even if the roster looks a bit different.There are some cornerstone players who you can pencil in for the 2030 squad that'll be heading for the French Alps. It would be surprising if Auston Matthews, Jack Eichel and the Tkachuk brothers weren't back to go for consecutive gold medals. The same goes for the Hughes brothers, who each played the role of overtime hero at different points during the knockout phase of the Milan Cortina Games.Beyond that, USA Hockey management will have some real decisions to make, and it's tough to predict exactly how the country's best young players will develop over the next four years. What about notable snubs from the 2026 roster, like Jason Robertson and Cole Caufield? Will they get the opportunity to play for gold in the French Alps, or will they be on the outside looking in again?There are also some players whose stars are rising so quickly that it's hard to believe they won't be wearing a Team USA jersey in four years. Lane Hutson is already a force on the blue line at 22, and Anaheim Ducks forward Cutter Gauthier is having a breakout campaign at the same age.\nNo matter what the 2030 Olympic roster looks like, those roster will have a tough act to follow. Here are the 25 players who might be tasked with winning back-to-back gold medals for the Americans.ForwardsMatt Boldy, WildCole Caufield, CanadiensLogan Cooley, MammothJosh Doan, SabresJack Eichel, Golden KnightsCutter Gauthier, DucksJack Hughes, DevilsClayton Keller, MammothDylan Larkin, Red WingsAuston Matthews, Maple LeafsJason Robertson, StarsTage Thompson, SabresBrady Tkachuk, SenatorsMatthew Tkachuk, PanthersThe Americans should return most of their centers from the 2026 gold medal squad with Eichel and Matthews anchoring the top two lines again. Larkin would provide a veteran presence, and Thompson would provide versatility up front. The notable newcomer up the middle is Cooley, who will be 25 years old in 2030. Cooley has already flashed elite playmaking ability, and he should only continue to develop between now and the next Olympics.The Tkachuk brothers aren't going anywhere. Matthew will be 32 years old in 2030, and Brady will be 30. They'll be back to help the Americans defend their gold medal. The same goes for golden goal overtime hero Hughes, who will only be 28. Keller might be able to carve out more of a role for himself on this roster as well.\nRobertson was one of the biggest snubs from the 2026 roster, and I think he gets the nod four years from now. Robertson is an elite goal-scorer, and I think he deserves his shot to make an impact on the world stage. Speaking of scoring, the 25-year-old Caufield is already up to 32 goals in 2025-26. Gauthier has taken a big step forward this year, and he's only 22 years old. Doan has proven to be a strong play-driver for the Sabres, and he could be a terrific bottom-six winger for Team USA.DefensemenZeev Buium, CanucksBrock Faber, WildQuinn Hughes, WildLane Hutson, CanadiensJackson LaCombe, DucksCharlie McAvoy, BruinsJake Sanderson, SenatorsZach Werenski, Blue JacketsWith the additions of Buium and Hutson, this blue line is a bit smaller than the one that just won gold in Milan. Still, USA Hockey has to play the hand it's dealt, and it has some gifted young defensemen on the rise. Hutson was close to making the roster this year, and his offensive skill is matched only by Hughes and Werenski. Meanwhile, Buium should evolve into a great two-way player over the next few years.Outside of that, the rest of the blue line should look awfully familiar. The toughest call on this projection was what to do with Jaccob Slavin. The shutdown defender was terrific against Canada in the gold medal game, but he will be 35 years old in 2030. If Slavin is still playing at a relatively high level, he could get the nod over Buium.\nGoaliesConnor Hellebuyck, JetsSpencer Knight, BlackhawksJake Oettinger, StarsGoaltending might have been the toughest position to project because there are so many options. Hellebuyck will be 36 years old in four years, but if he's still an above average NHL goalie, how could the Americans leave him at home? Hellebuyck has established himself as a USA Hockey icon, and he probably has a spot on the 2030 roster already.The last two goaltending spots came down to four players. Oettinger and Jeremy Swayman, both 27 years old, could easily be back in 2030. That said, there is some young talent nipping at their heels. Knight is having an exceptional campaign with the Chicago Blackhawks, and Dustin Wolf was the Calder Trophy runner-up in 2024-25.Ultimately, I split the difference and brought back one goalie from the 2026 team (Oettinger) and took one of the newcomers (Knight). However, it wouldn't surprise me at all to see the Americans run it back in goal.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2028 Summer Olympics are still two years away, but athletes are already confirming that they intend to compete when Los Angeles serves as host. Four-time Olympic gold medalist Kevin Durant is one of those athletes, as he told ESPN that he has every intention to compete at the 2028 Games.\"Hell yeah, I want to play,\" Durant said. \"I would love to, but I've got to stay on top of my game. I'm not expecting, I want to produce on the floor and make Grant [Hill] and whoever is making the decisions, want to put me on the team. I don't want -- not just for seniority. I want to still prove I can help the team win.\"Durant will be just two months shy of turning 40 when the 2028 Summer Olympics happen, but if he maintains the level of play that we've seen this season over the next two years, there would be no reason to not include him on the Olympic roster.Health will certainly be a major factor in the matter, but Durant's been durable in each of the last three seasons including the current one, and if that trend keeps, he should be a no-brainer to make the roster. The way Durant plays lends itself to aging well in the NBA, and we've seen that in the years since he tore his Achilles in 2019. He's been an All-Star in six of the seven years since that injury cost him a full season in the NBA, and the outlier year was because he was limited to 39 games due to injury.\nDurant earning a roster spot on Team USA isn't the surprising part, it's that he still wants to compete in the Olympics. There was an assumption that the 2024 Paris Games would be the final year he, LeBron James and Stephen Curry would all compete with Team USA. James has already said publicly that he doesn't plan on suiting up for the 2028 Games. Curry hasn't said if he'll play, but he'll also be 40 by then.But Durant is letting us know that we were all wrong with that line of thinking.\"You guys, the media, have projected that,\" Durant said. \"That narrative, where did the last dance thing come from? I didn't say I wasn't playing. LeBron said he wasn't. You didn't hear that from me or Steph.\"For now we can pencil Durant's name in for the 2028 Olympic roster, which will certainly see some turnover with all the aging stars likely not participating. Cade Cunningham stated his desire to play in the 2028 Olympics in a recent GQ profile, while making the bold statement that he thinks he's the best American player. And will get some holdovers like Anthony Edwards, Jayson Tatum and Tyrese Haliburton, as well as several of the younger players who are just starting out like Rookie of the Year frontrunners Cooper Flagg and Kon Knueppel.\nTeam USA certainly won't be short on talent to pick from, but there's already this narrative that other countries are starting to catch up with them. The men's basketball team has won a gold medal in each of the last five Olympic Games, as they've been the far superior team in most cases in Olympic history. There's only been three times the U.S. men's basketball team hasn't won gold since 1936, so it's been an incredibly dominant run for them in the sport for a very long time.However, at the 2024 Games, teams like Serbia and France did put up a good fight against Team USA, and Canada's talent pool just continues to deepen with each passing year. The talent gap isn't as wide as it once was, but Durant thinks it's being overblown.\"I just don't like the talk around the USA versus European style of how you approach the game,\" Durant said. \"All I hear is, 'AAU is destroying the game; the Euros do it right while the Americans do it wrong.'\" \nDurant went on to talk about how he feels the conversation feels a bit racially charged in the way its discussed.\"It's a lot of bullshit with that,\" Durant said. \"I can read between the lines on that. It's a shot at Black Americans. We're controlling the sport. They're tired of us controlling the sport. 'France is coming for you.' Really? We smacked them boys.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Team USA's World Baseball Classic roster looks like the best they've ever put together, but it just took a hit.Two-time AL Cy Young winner Tarik Skubal will pitch just once for USA and it'll happen in pool play (March 7 vs. Great Britain). If the USA advances to the championship round, as expected, Skubal won't pitch.\"If they go to the finals, I think I'm going to try and lobby to just go watch and be with the guys,\" he told reporters, including The Athletic, Monday.That's too bad. Those of us who had already started looking ahead figured Skubal could be the USA starter in either the semifinals or finals, giving a nice edge to the squad. After all, he's won two straight Cy Young awards, two straight AL ERA titles and has a 2.04 ERA in six career playoff starts. Instead, if the USA advances, it'll be without Skubal. \nThat gives the mantle of ace to Paul Skenes alone, instead of Skenes just being a \"co-ace.\" The USA isn't hurting for starters after Skubal or Skenes, either, as All-Stars Logan Webb and Matthew Boyd are also on the team. Fellow All-Star Joe Ryan is on the roster, though he's currently dealing with a back injury, as is youngster Nolan McLean and his veteran Mets teammate Clay Holmes. The offense is headed up by Aaron Judge, Cal Raleigh, Bobby Witt Jr., Bryce Harper and Kyle Schwarber. This is to say that, yes, the USA is still plenty talented and could well win the finals. Not having Skubal for the championship round is still a bit of a bummer.\nPool play kicks off next week in Tokyo, San Juan, Houston, and Miami, and the tournament will conclude with the championship game at Miami's LoanDepot Park on March 17. Team USA won the 2017 WBC, but fell to Japan in the finals in 2023. The Americans are the favorite to win this year (-115, per Caesars), ahead of Japan (+350) and the Dominican Republic (+425).\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Boston Celtics star Jaylen Brown led all scorers in Sunday's 111-89 road rout of the Los Angeles Lakers with 32 points, and his performance prompted LeBron James to speak up for him as an NBA MVP candidate. While Brown ranks fourth in the league in scoring and is the face of a surprisingly successful Celtics squad, he stands behind numerous stars in the award race, and that is a reality that James cannot get behind.This has been a career year for Brown, whose 29.2 points per game are by far a personal high and who leads the league in field goal attempts per game.\"JB is playing great basketball, man,\" James said after the rivalry game. \"This whole MVP thing, I don't understand why his name is not getting talked about some, as well. Nobody gave them a shot to start the season. He's averaging, what, 30? Just under 30. It's a popularity contest sometimes.\"The only knock against Brown's production is that he is less efficient than some of his elite counterparts. His usage rate has spiked this year as he flourished into the Celtics' ringleader with Jayson Tatum out with a torn Achilles. Because his increased workload is such a large catalyst behind his elevated play, he ranks No. 12 in the NBA's efficiency metric, well behind the premier MVP contenders.That, and Brown's lack of superstar pedigree, are likely the most to blame for his sixth-place standing in the MVP race, per FanDuel odds.\nNBA MVP oddsShai Gilgeous-Alexander, Thunder (-145)Nikola Jokić, Nuggets (+270)Cade Cunningham, Pistons (+650)Victor Wembanyama, Spurs (+2500)Luka Dončić, Lakers (+4000)Jaylen Brown, Celtics (+5000)Jaylen Brown's value goes beyond career-best scoring outputWhile Brown cannot compete with the likes of Jokić, Dončić and Gilgeous-Alexander from an efficiency standpoint, the value he brings to the Celtics is undeniably important for a team that seeks to contend in what was supposed to be a down year.In past years he was a prominent wingman to Tatum, but this season, Brown has proven an ability to put a franchise on his shoulders and lead it to championship contention. The Celtics are second in the Eastern Conference, while preseason projected win totals suggested they should have been in firm danger of missing the playoffs.\"I think he's just using motivation of a lot of people saying that they're going to have a down year because of JT being out, them losing Jrue [Holiday],\" James said. \"Al [Horford] leaves. [Kristaps] Porziņģis leaves. Their whole championship team pretty much is revamped. He uses that as motivation to keep them afloat. They're playing great basketball, and it's because of him and the rest of those guys. He's taken that next step.\"\nWhat's more, Brown has been highly available, playing 51 of the Celtics' 56 games. That is more than any of the MVP candidates who stand ahead of him on the odds board.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The WNBA made enough money in 2025 to trigger revenue sharing for the first time in league history, the Women's National Basketball Players Association told ESPN on Monday. The 13 teams that played last season will receive a total of $8 million to disperse to players. It's unclear how much revenue the league made last season or the amount needed to generate revenue sharing. The WNBPA did not disclose bank statements to ESPN, and the league declined to comment. In addition, the WNBPA is set to disperse $9.25 million to players from revenue generated from licensing agreements for jersey sales, trading cards and video games, among other items, since 2020. Payments will be determined based on years played from 2020-2025, with a maximum of $50,000 for each player. The news comes amid the ongoing labor battle between the league and the players, which has lasted for more than a year and is threatening to shorten or, in a worst case scenario, cancel the 2026 WNBA season. With less than three months until the 2026 campaign is set to tip off on May 8, the two sides have still not agreed to a new collective bargaining agreement. \n\"This shows our value and how what we're fighting for makes sense and how we should keep fighting,\" WNBPA treasurer Brianna Turner told ESPN.The revenue targets in the 2020 CBA (which officially expired in January) were based on numbers for the 2019 season and compounded 20% across the subsequent seasons, but the COVID-19 pandemic shortened the 2020 season to 22 games and the 2021 season to 32 games. As a result, revenue sharing was thought to be extremely under the most recent CBA. Per the 2020 CBA, players would receive 50% of shared revenue (amount of revenue over a pre-determeined threshold, minus 30% for expenses). In 2025, the players' portion of the shared revenue was $16 million, the WNBPA told ESPN. Of that $16 million, $8 million will go to players who were active in 2025 and $8 million will be used for league marketing agreements. \nRevenue sharing remains the biggest obstacle to a new CBA. The WNBPA is fighting for a share of gross revenue, while the league is still offering a share of net revenue -- that is, the revenue remaining when league-specified operating expenses are removed from the pot.The WNBPA's most recent proposal would see the players receive an average of 27.5% of the gross revenue over the course of the agreement (with a $9.5 million salary cap in 2026), sources familiar with the negotiations confirmed to CBS Sports. The league's most recent prosposal would offer the players 70% of net revenue over the course of the deal (with a $5.65 million salary cap in 2026). Last month, the WNBA announced the full schedule for the 2026 season. Training camps are scheduled to begin on April 19, with preseason games to begin on April 25 and opening night set for May 8. \nWith just over two months until training camps are supposed to open, the two sides not only have to come to terms on a new CBA, but hold a double expansion draft for the Toronto Tempo and Portland Fire, and conduct the busiest free agency period in league history.\"Time is of the essence,\" WNBPA vice president Breanna Stewart told CBS Sports earlier this month. \"I think that both sides are very aware that this has gone on way longer than it needed to. But hopefully we can really start to be hearing each other and they hear us on things that are non-negotiables.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        With all the major in-season milestones now completed, our attention shifts to the fantasy playoffs, which for some are only mere weeks away. After some shortened weeks, the schedule returns to normal, with 14 teams tabled for four appearances, and another 14 teams suiting up three times. That leaves two teams with only two games, those being the Clippers and the Suns.Sitting players who only go one or two times has its advantages, but fantasy managers still have to make smart decisions when figuring out whom to play, regardless of game count. Being aware of back-to-back sets is also a key factor, especially with so many teams now sitting players due to injury management.Four Games: BKN, BOS, CLE, DAL, DET, HOU, LAL, MEM, MIL, NOP, OKC, POR, SAC, SASThree Games: ATL, CHA, CHI, DEN, GSW, IND, MIA, MIN, NYK, ORL, PHI, TOR, UTA, WASTwo Games: LAC, PHOHere are four potential starts and four potential sits entering the 19th week of the NBA season. Just keep in mind that this is based on games played for the week. If you play in a rotisserie league, the number of games played each week may not matter in your format.\nGuardsConsider starting: Jaylen Wells, MEMOpponents: SAC, GSW, @DAL, @INDWith many teams openly tanking, our trust levels right now are at an all-time low. While the Grizzlies certainly fall into that category, it appears as though Wells might be somewhat trustworthy. He has missed only one game in the past month, averaging 26.0 minutes per game during that span. Although he is only averaging 14 points, 0.8 steals, and 2.1 3-pointers, the fact that he is playing close to starter-level minutes on a nightly basis could be enough to warrant a starting spot this week, especially with four games on the table. If you need points and 3s, Wells feels like a relatively safe option.Consider starting: Jordan Poole, NOPOpponents: GSW, @UTA, @UTA, @LACUnlike Wells, our trust level when it comes to Poole is almost non-existent. After inexplicably falling out of the rotation for nine straight games, he has resurfaced recently, logging at least 24 minutes in each of the past two games. Fresh off a 23-point performance against the 76ers, managers were reminded just what Poole is capable of when afforded meaningful minutes. There are absolutely no guarantees when it comes to what the Pelicans' rotation could look like going forward. However, if you are in a position to take some risk, Poole could be worth considering, should his recent uptick turn into anything resembling long-term value.Consider sitting: Kyshawn George, WASOpponents: @ATL, @ATL, TORNot only does Washington have two games this week, but the nightly rotations are almost impossible to project at this point. George has played in four of the past six games, although he has exceeded 20 minutes of playing time only once during that span. It appears as though Washington is comfortable with what his long-term role looks like, meaning his court time down the stretch could be largely underwhelming. While he is a relatively safe bench candidate this week, managers may also want to consider moving on altogether, given his rank in 11 games over the past month sits outside the top 120 in nine-category leagues. \nForwardsConsider starting: GG Jackson, MEMOpponents: SAC, GSW, @DAL, @INDAnother of the trustworthy names in Memphis, Jackson has stepped into a much larger role following the trade deadline. In four appearances over the past two weeks, he has averaged 18.8 points, 5.5 rebounds, 2.5 assists, 1.8 3-pointers, and 1.6 combined steals and blocks in 26.3 minutes per game. While it does appear as though topping 30 minutes per night could be a reach, Jackson seems to be locked into a regular role, having not missed a game since Dec. 20. Of all the players on the Memphis roster, Jackson and Wells seem to be the two we can trust the most, at least for the foreseeable future.Consider sitting: John Collins, LACOpponents: MIN, NOPThe Clippers will suit up only twice this week, which in itself is enough reason to leave Collins on your bench. However, Collins is also dealing with an eye injury, which ruled him out of Sunday's game against the Magic. Finally, Collins' per-game production has been far from spectacular, averaging 13.0 points, 6.8 rebounds, and 1.6 combined steals and blocks in four games over the past two weeks, leaving him outside the top 100 in standard leagues. Add all of this together, and we have a relatively straightforward decision when it comes to whether to sit or start Collins.Consider sitting: Grayson Allen, PHOOpponents: BOS, LALWhile they do play very different positions, we can almost treat this as a rinse-and-repeat situation, with Phoenix only having two games in the next seven days. Much like Collins, Allen is also dealing with an injury, which also ruled him out on Sunday. While his production has been far better than that of Collins, there simply isn't enough meat on the bone, given the number of players that play four games this week. This one is a little tougher, but ultimately, leaving Allen on the bench could very well end up being the smart choice.\nCentersConsider starting: Maxime Raynaud, SACOpponents: @MEM, @HOU, @DAL, @LALIn what is a perfect example of last-man-standing, Raynaud looks set for a strong finish to the season. Both Domantas Sabonis (knee) and Dylan Cardwell (ankle) are missing right now, with Sabonis having been ruled out for the remainder of the season. Despite some defensive limitations, Raynaud is likely to play upwards of 30 minutes per game, at least for the next month. In four appearances over the past two weeks, he has averaged 15.3 points and 12.3 rebounds in 32.8 minutes per game, shooting 52.1 percent from the floor and 91.7 percent from the line. This is an easy one. Make sure Cardwell isn't sitting on your bench this week.Consider sitting: Brook Lopez, LACOpponents: MIN, NOPFollowing the trade of Ivica Zubac, Lopez was handed the starting role. While expectations were rightfully modest, he has managed to put up standard league production, averaging 11.5 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 3.3 combined steals and blocks in 32.9 minutes per game in his past four appearances. However, as always, his overall fantasy value is basically tied to his defensive production. With only two games coming up, there is a good chance you can replicate his numbers with someone slated to play four times, while also providing you with serviceable contributions across other categories.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Slow starts have hindered Scottie Scheffler early in the 2026 PGA Tour season. You know it. He knows it. The whole golf world knows it. Of course, \"slow\" and \"hindered\" are relative when it comes to what the world No. 1 is capable of accomplishing. Scheffler looked like a mid-handicapper for 50% of the Genesis Invitational yet still finished T12 alongside Jordan Spieth, a player who completed his best tournament finish since June 2025. This is not a drive-by on Spieth; it is an illustration that Scheffler's performances are all about perspective.Scheffler went to bed Thursday evening without another name below his on the leaderboard. He played his first 10 holes of the tournament in 5 over and was forced to make an 8-foot par putt on his 36th hole just to see hole No. 37 in a tournament where no one misses the cut. And still, he somehow threatened to extend his top 10 streak to 19 in a row ... though he did ultimately fall short, ending the longest run on the PGA Tour.Perspective!Scheffler won in his season debut at the American Express, becoming the third player under the age of 30 to notch 20 PGA Tour victories and four major championships. The other two? Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus. Scheffler finished one stroke outside of a playoff at the WM Phoenix Open after opening with a 73 that put him 10 strokes behind his playing partner and eventual winner, Chris Gotterup.\nA win would have been Scheffler's third at that tournament -- a mark that would have pulled him alongside none other than Arnold Palmer for most in the event's history.After opening with a 72 in benign conditions at the Pebble Beach Pro-Am, Scheffler closed with a 63 thanks to three final-round eagles, falling two strokes short of eventual champion Collin Morikawa. A win at Pebble Beach means something a little more. You look at the names. You look at that venue. You read through the history.The same holds at Riviera Country Club, host of the Genesis Invitational, especially as it represents one of the three biggest non-major tournaments on the PGA Tour schedule. The signature events reign these days, but there are three tournaments with lasting power, no matter how the PGA Tour calendar might change.\nTiger's tournament.Arnie's tournament.Jack's tournament.Combined, they make up the PGA Tour's big three player-hosted invitationals that, despite being labeled signature events, still have cuts at the 36-hole mark. Should they chop off more than those who finish outside the top 50 and more than 10 strokes behind the leader, especially when a field is only 72 players? Yes, but that is a conversation for a different day.Winning one is amazing. Just ask last week's champion, Jacob Bridgeman. Winning two, now that is something really special. Many of the all-time greats have done just that. But winning all three on those golf courses? That is as rare as it gets when it comes to PGA Tour accolades, as only Fred Couples and Ernie Els have conquered the triumvirate (Hale Irwin won the 1976 Citrus Open at Rio Pinar Country Club, later called the Arnold Palmer Invitational).Players to win at least two of the big threePlayerTotal winsGenesis InvitationalArnold Palmer InvitationalMemorial TournamentTiger Woods13🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆Fred Couples4🏆🏆🏆🏆Ernie Els4🏆🏆🏆🏆Kenny Perry4🏆🏆🏆🏆Scottie Scheffler4🏆🏆🏆🏆Tom Watson4🏆🏆🏆🏆Hale Irwin3🏆🏆🏆Phil Mickelson3🏆🏆🏆Bryson DeChambeau2🏆🏆Hideki Matsuyama2🏆🏆Jon Rahm2🏆🏆Vijay Singh2🏆🏆There are stipulations to all of the names listed above -- blame the PGA Tour's record keeping -- as Els, of course, did not receive a trophy from Woods. In fact, he was making sure he was not winning one as the Big Easy's title came at the expense of Woods, who finished two strokes behind the South African -- the closest he ever came to winning at Riviera. Irwin's win at the Citrus Open came before Palmer began hosting the event at Bay Hill.\"Here and Memorial -- I think the player-hosted invitationals are becoming increasingly important in the PGA Tour schedule,\" Rory McIlroy said last week. \"I have been lucky enough to win at Bay Hill, but Arnold wasn't around when I did it. It would be really cool to get a trophy from Tiger and get a trophy from Jack at some point. [Riviera] and Muirfield are two ones that I would love to check off.\"Scheffler has already won twice at Arnie's and Jack's tournaments, but Tiger's continues to elude him. It is not unfair to suggest this year might have been it had he not started so poorly. Scheffler played his final 62 holes in 16 under, while Bridgeman won the tournament at 18 under. Over the last three rounds, Scheffler clipped the winner by a shot.While these rough starts have put Scheffler in holes, they have allowed us to see his true competitive grit. That no-quit attitude is reminiscent of a boxer who has taken punch after punch to the point that he can't see out of one eye, but he still manages to stay on his feet and go another round.Scheffler remains the favorite at all four major championships: 3-1 at the Masters, 19/5 at the PGA Championship, 16/5 at the U.S. Open and 5-1 at The Open, per FanDuel.The comebacks have been impressive and fun to watch. They have shown us what Scheffler is capable of achieving, even when he's stuck deep in the chasing pack. In another sense, they have shown us what else he can do, as we already knew the Texan can win when he's well out in front.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Phoenix Suns have been one of the NBA's best stories this season, and Dillon Brooks has been at the heart of it. He's scoring at a rate (and in ways) we've never seen from him before on any kind of a consistent basis. He's defending, as always. His competitive prints are all over one of the grittiest teams in the league. And now he has a broken hand.There are bummers and there are bummers. This is the latter. Here's to hoping Brooks can get back in time for the playoffs/Play-In tournament (ESPN reports he'll be out 4-6 weeks), but in the meantime the Suns, who are also without Devin Booker (hip strain) for at least the next week, need to find a way to replace at least some of Brooks' 21 points per game. The natural next man for that job would be Jalen Green, who also came over from Houston with Brooks in the Kevin Durant trade. You're forgiven if you forgot Green even played for the Suns. He's missed most of the season with a hamstring issue that has refused to fully repair. But he's back and healthy (for) now. He had 26 points and four 3-pointers against San Antonio coming out of the All-Star break. On Saturday, he made up for a miserable shooting night by knocking down a fading corner 3 at the buzzer to beat the Magic in overtime. \nGreen is an electric athlete who had a legitimate superstar stretch last season in Houston, but he's never been a consistent shooter or anything close to an efficient scorer on the whole. He's only 24, but he's making $33.5 million. Next year that number rises to $36.2 million, and the year after that he has a $36 million player option as the first player to ever sign a 2+1 rookie extension on a nine-figure contract. It's a lot of money if Green doesn't pan out. But if he does, it has a chance to become a team-friendly deal. He's not going to defend like Brooks, if at all. He's not going to go to work in the post. But he'll never have a better opportunity to prove his value than right now, with the Suns badly in need of anyone who can contribute to the cause of recreating Brooks' production in the aggregate, particularly as a self creator. One of the notable strides Brooks has made this year is as a guy who can get buckets on his own; over 55% of his field goals have been unassisted. For better or worse, this is what Green does. Last season 63% of his non-garbage-time buckets were unassisted (that was the highest percentage for any wing in the league, per Cleaning the Glass). \nAgain, it's never been efficient. And so far it hasn't been with the Suns. On Sunday, Green cooked up a donut in the first half of Phoenix's loss to Portland and finished 1 of 7 from 3. So far this season he's averaging 13.3 points and shooting 38% from the field over 10 games. Small and randomized sample notwithstanding, that's obviously not going to cut it. \nBut don't be fooled, there is a big-time-scorer version of Jalen Green that is going to come out, and the Suns need it to be sooner than later. The dream of him turning into the actual superstar his talent theoretically suggests he could be is almost surely dead, but the question remains whether he can be winning player on a winning team. We've seen in in stretches, but the Rockets, all told, were more than eight points per 100 possessions better with him off the floor last season, per CTG. He's probably regarded as a negative asset at this point with $70 million in guaranteed money still on the books, but winning looks good on everyone. He's playing for another contract, be it in Phoenix or elsewhere. \nThese next six weeks aren't do-or-die for Green; he'll have a big opportunity next season, as well. But it has to start now. NBA perceptions can become sort of irreversible at some point, and Green is toeing that line as the dreaded empty-stats scorer. It just so happens that the Suns -- who are just two games back of the No. 6 Timberwolves with one head-to-head remaining and the tiebreaker already secured, but are also just two games up on the No. 8 Warriors -- are not in a position to consider any scoring stat empty without Brooks. They scored 77 points on Sunday. They need every bucket they can get. And if there's one thing Green can do, it's get buckets. \n            ",

Between now and then is the small matter of rounding out the field for the last 16. For plenty of the big sides there is work to do with Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid holding onto one goal leads and Atletico Madrid licking their wounds after a 3-3 draw.The biggest pressure is on the Serie A giants however. Last year's finalists Inter returned from Bodo/Glimt having been utterly chastened in a 3-1 loss that has their Champions League hopes on the brink.

Is Osimhen a top five striker in the world?Without wishing to state the obvious, the very best center forwards in the world tend to be the ones who score the most. You might get the odd Roberto Firmino type whose qualities lie in facilitation, but if you wear the No. 9 shirt (or one whose digits add up to nine), you'd best be putting the ball in the onion bag. Move to the very best of the very best, though, and you enter the class of players who can deliver all the goals you need but still, on those rare off days, bend a big contest to their will without scoring. A prime reference point for that might be Victor Osimhen's obliterating of Juventus in a 5-2 win that will almost certainly have Galatasaray in the last 16 of the Champions League for the first time in 12 years.\nWhat was funny about the devastation wrought by Osimhen on his former boss Luciano Spalletti was that it really didn't show up on a cursory glance at the stats sheet. Three shots for 0.13 xG, 11 of 18 passes completed, no chances created. You're telling me this is the guy you're considering placing behind Erling Haaland and Kylian Mbappe in the pantheon of center forwards, maybe on a par with Ousmane Dembele and Harry Kane? Dig a little deeper though and you see something. Ten touches in the opposition box is usually the sort of number a Champions League striker registers when they're on the positive end of a severe talent mismatch. The 0.41 expected assists is pretty sprightly too, though Opta does not have any assists logged for the Nigerian international. Check UEFA's data and you will find two and it was those moments that typified the chaos Osimhen created both before and after Juventus went down to 10 men. His pressing was ferocious, his commitment in the duels relentless. Gabriel Sara's opener would not have come about if Osimhen hadn't sensed a heavy touch by Kenan Yildiz and hit him hard. Galatasaray's fourth is the poacher's instinct of a striker reinterpreted for when the other team has possession. Lurking on the blind side, waiting for the moment when Juventus think they can breath because the initial wave of pressure has crashed against them. They never see Osimhen coming.\nSuch elite off ball play tends to be one of the first things that goes when strikers enter the pantheon of the best on earth. So many reason that they need to save their energy for what they do best. You would figure the intensity would drop off even more when a player moves out of Europe's top five leagues to the sort of environment he can dominate at 80% energy. And yet Osimhen averages an incredibly impressive 1.75 interceptions per 90 minutes in the Super Lig this season, four times what Mbappe, for instance, does for Real Madrid in league play. It translates on the European stage too. Only eight players win possession in the attacking third more frequently than Osimhen has in this season's Champions League. All that is to say nothing for how he holds possession when he gets it, bringing others into play.As for the thing that really matters for strikers, you know that Osimhen delivers on that front. Perhaps not quite with the consistency of last year but 15 goals in 23 games is not to be sniffed at, all the more so when six of them have come in the Champions League. There might not have been any in his last four games but there is no shame in struggling to find the net against Manchester City and Atletico Madrid, particularly when even after Galatasaray's recent aggressive investment they are not a club that can go toe to toe with those sides on talent terms.So Osimhen then is quite clearly one of Europe's outstanding strikers, right? Well probably, when he's fit. That has been the recurring problem for the 27-year-old, who missed the weekend's defeat to Konyaspor with a knee injury. He is said to be a doubt for the trip to Turin too, albeit he is expected to travel. Per Transfermarkt, this was the eighth separate injury he has suffered since leaving Napoli, initially on loan, at the start of last season. They say availability is the best ability. Whether that is or isn't the case (it isn't), it might be the only one a striker needs that Osimhen is missing.\n2. Can Bodo/Glimt see out their upset on the road?So, how much of Bodo/Glimt's stunning 3-1 win over Inter was down to what is probably the most significant home field advantage in the Champions League this season. The artificial turf and freezing temperatures have been a pretty helpful swing factor against not just Inter but Manchester City, Lazio and Porto in the last 18 months. Since the start of the 2020-21 season, Bodo/Glimt have a European record at the Aspmyra Stadion that can stand up against all but the continent's superteams: 19 wins, two draws and nine defeats. That's a smidge under two points per game. Their opponents, twice Champions League finalists in that same time period, average exactly two.And so Bodo/Glimt's win was one we might have seen coming, but was it enough? Because as good as the Norwegian champions are at home, their road record is pretty abysmal: seven wins, 14 draws and 19 defeats. Most notably they seem to struggle when travelling for knockout games. There are isolated periods of success, winning against Celtic in Glasgow and getting the result they needed away to AZ in the 2021-22 Conference League. The following year the giants of Bohemians and Pyunik fell at home to Bodo/Glimt but not a lot else. Across their last 40 away European matches a goal difference of -20 is bad but it could have been so much worse, their non-penalty xG difference is -29.36. Historically they're three-quarters of a goal per game worse than their opponents on the road and most of those opponents are not Inter.So historically Bodo/Glimt have the look of a team that could very plausibly cede a two goal lead to a European juggernaut. But this isn't 2021-22 Bodo/Glimt. Their money-spinning runs through the Europa League have not only allowed this club to recruit and retain Norwegian stars like Frederik Bjorkan and Kasper Hogh, but to bring back the likes of Patrick Berg and Jens Petter Hauge after moves to the big five leagues. As their manager Kjetil Knutsen explained, this is a team that have only improved from their many trips across the continent.\n\"I really believe in our identity and in the work we do over time,\" he said. \"That [way] it becomes second nature, there's loyalty, and a culture where we trust the quality we have within the team. We've also been extremely fortunate because we've been in the Europa [League] over a sustained period, facing stronger and stronger opposition. Both personally and as a [coaching] team, we've trusted the process.\"The current iteration shouldn't be written off as just a side who do the business at home. Kjetil Knutsen's men took five points on their travels in the league phase, the memorable win against Atletico Madrid following draws at Borussia Dortmund and Slavia Prague, the latter a fighting performance to overturn a two goal deficit in the final 12 minutes. Most worryingly of all for Inter, Bodo/Glimt are proving themselves to be a team who can execute in the particular scenario ahead of them. Four of their 17 goals in this season's Champions League have come on the counter attack, a tally bettered only by Real Madrid and they average a breakout that ends in a shot once per game. If they can just convert that moment when it comes their way, they will set Inter an almighty task.3. Will Mbappe break Ronaldo's single season scoring record?Even with the new Champions League format exposing players to as many as four extra games in the competition, it feels remarkable that before spring has sprung Kylian Mbappe finds himself so close to what once seemed an unbreakable Champions League record. The 17 goals that Cristiano Ronaldo hammered home in the 2013-14 competition included a healthy dose of group stage output against lesser opposition and some thundering beatdowns on the likes of Schalke, Bayern Munich and Atletico Madrid. Thereafter only Ronaldo got within one again and those who even sniffed it were the best striker in the world in the form of their lives (Robert Lewandowski in 2019-20 and Karim Benzema two years later).\nKylian Mbappe might be the first of those things, only time will tell if the latter is true. What he is not, for the moment at least, is at the head of an all-conquering attack like those led by Lewandowski, Benzema and Ronaldo. Even so he needs just four more goals to match the single season scoring record in this competition.\n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            You suspect a player averaging 5.7 shots and 0.73 non-penalty xG per 90 will back himself to add a few more against Benfica this week, who have given up nine shots to Mbappe in two games so far in the competition. What bodes best for him in this Champions League iteration is that he has had that very Ronaldo-ish quality of scoring in bunches: two against Monaco, three on Kairat, four against Olympiacos.The only question is whether Madrid can go far enough in this competition to allow Mbappe to get up to and ahead of his predecessor. Much will depend on Friday's draw, assuming Los Merengues are in it. If Madrid drop on Manchester City's side then we are in crapshoot territory, two sides that have hardly inspired great faith in their Champions League chops duking it out once more in games that are reliably incomprehensible. The other option though is Sporting and while any team that has beaten PSG and won in Bilbao will deserve Madrid's respect, they will also have plenty to fear from an in form Mbappe. Get this guy to the quarterfinals and he might already have delivered the greatest scoring season this competition has seen.\n            ",

The Falcons have until July 15 to sign Pitts to a contract. If he were to play on the tag in 2026, Pitts would make a fully-guaranteed $16,007,000, according to Spotrac. The Falcons are expected to have $26,462,519 in cap space, which ranks No. 15 in the NFL per Over The Cap. Jones also mentioned the possibility of Pitts being tagged and traded if there was a suitor that offered enticing-enough compensation. Atlanta's first selection in this upcoming draft comes at No. 48 overall.Pitts was considered to be one of the top tight ends set to hit free agency, headlining a list that includes Travis Kelce, David Njoku, Isaiah Likely, Dallas Goedert, Cade Otton and Chig Okonkwo. \nPitts is coming off a career year in which he caught 88 passes for 928 yards and five touchdowns. He delivered what was the best outing of his NFL career during a Week 15 prime-time victory against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, in which he caught 11 of 12 targets from Kirk Cousins for 166 yards and three touchdowns. The Florida product made the Pro Bowl in 2021 after becoming the first rookie tight end to cross 1,000 yards receiving since Mike Ditka in 1961, and was named a Second Team All-Pro this past season. In 78 career games played, Pitts has caught 284 passes for 3,579 yards and 15 touchdowns. \nPitts is the second reported player to be in line to receive the franchise tag, joining Dallas Cowboys wide receiver George Pickens. Running back Breece Hall of the New York Jets is another player to watch. \n            \n",

We want him here, love him. And I think he wants to be here, so all that's a plus,\" Jones said, per The Athletic. The window to place the franchise tag on players opened on Feb. 17, and runs through March 3. The deadline to sign Pickens to a long-term deal will be July 15. If he were to play on the tag in 2026, Pickens would make a fully-guaranteed $28,037,000, per Spotrac. \nThe Cowboys acquired Pickens from the Pittsburgh Steelers last offseason, and put together his best NFL season in a contract year. Pickens caught 93 passes for 1,429 yards and nine touchdowns, and was selected to the Pro Bowl for the first time. Spotrac predicts Pickens could sign a deal that averages $30.6 million per year, which would make him the No. 7 highest-paid receiver in the NFL if we go off of last year's numbers. Pickens has said that he's searching for the \"ultimate best deal\" that benefits both parties, but it remains to be seen what that could be. Just because the Cowboys are tagging Pickens doesn't guarantee he will be on roster in 2026. The Cowboys reportedly view tagging and trading Pickens away as a possibility, according to NFL Media, but the goal is to reach a new multi-year deal. \n\"I'm talking to George all the time by virtue of my excitement for him,\" Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said of Pickens' future. \"He's better than, as far as what he contributed to our team, showing the potential that he could contribute. I'm looking forward to getting things worked out so George can be a Cowboy [for] a long time.\"\n            \n",

    "body": "\n        Jaxon Smith-Njigba picked the perfect time to have the best season of his career. The NFL's reigning Offensive Player of the Year led the league in receiving yards in 2025 during a career season that saw him go off for 1,793 yards and 10 touchdown catches. The timing couldn't have been better for the Seahawks star, who just finished his third NFL season, which means he's now eligible to get a contract extension for the first time. Smith-Njigba, who was selected with the 23rd overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft, has developed into one of the top receivers in the NFL and he definitely wants to be paid like one of the top receivers. During a recent interview with Jonah Javad of WFAA, the 24-year-old was asked if wants to be the highest paid receiver in the NFL and he didn't hesitate with his answer. \"I think, I believe I deserve to be the highest paid in my position, just what I give to the game and the community, I give it my all,\" JSN said. \"I think that's worth a lot.\"\nSmith-Njigba made just $1.55 million in base salary last season during the third year of his rookie deal and he's only scheduled to make $2.72 million in 2026 (He signed a four-year, $14.42 million rookie deal that included a $7.49 million signing bonus), so he's certainly underpaid. After his huge 2025 season, he's clearly looking for a raise. So what does that mean for the Seahawks? Glad you asked. Let's check out the receiver market. Highest-paid receivers in the NFLThe NFL's highest-paid receiver right now is Ja'Marr Chase, who signed a four-year, $161 million contract extension back in March. Chase's deal pays him an average of $40.25 million per year, so if Smith-Njigba is looking to top that number, that means he's aiming to get $40.3 million per year at the minimum.\nThe second-highest paid receiver in the NFL is Minnesota's Justin Jefferson, who's pulling in an average of $35 million per year. There's a huge gap between Chase and Jefferson and it's possible the Seahawks could try to fit Smith-Njigba's new contract number somewhere in there, but with JSN saying \"I deserve to be the highest paid,\" there may not be a lot of wiggle room. This could be a situation where the Seahawks either agree to pay him what he's asking for or things could get contentious. The Seahawks will also likely need to include more than $110 million in guaranteed money to top both Chase and Jefferson in that department. The Seahawks do have Smith-Njigba under contract for one more year (2026), plus a potential fifth-year option in 2027 on top of that, so they could conceivably kick the can until next offseason. Yes, JSN wants to get paid, but he doesn't seem to be in a hurry. \"I'm really not too pressed right now to get it done,\" Smith-Njigba said. \"I know my time is coming and when we get it done it's gonna be a great deal. And, you know, God's timing is perfect timing. So, whenever that may come, we'll be ready for it.\"\nBasically, a deal could certainly get done this season, but there's also a chance that it would take until next offseason. One big reason why Smith-Njigba might be willing to wait is because the receiver market could be going up in the next few months, which takes us to our next topic. Why the Rams should be paying close attentionAs things currently stand, there are only really two players who have any shot of resetting the receiving market over the next 12 months. One of them is Smith-Njigba and the other one is Puka Nacua. The Rams receiver has been one of the biggest bargains in NFL history over the past three years. During the 2025 season, he made just $1.03 million in base salary under the terms of his rookie contract and that will go up to just $5.66 million in 2026. Although JSN's rookie contract could technically keep him tied to Seattle until 2027, the Rams are in a more pressing situation with Nacua. Since he was taken in the fifth-round, there's no fifth-year option with his contract. His deal expires after the 2026 season, so the Rams need to get something done now (or they could face a situation where they're forced to hit him with the franchise tag next year). \nNacua led the NFL in yards per game (107.2) and receptions in 2025 (129). He's also averaged 104.3 catches per year during his three NFL seasons. Rams general manager Les Snead is well aware that his team is going to have to pay Nacua a boatload of money in the very near future.  \"If you're one of the best at what you do and obviously he's evolved into one of the best things, that's a pretty simple contract because it's pretty self-explanatory where you fall in the ecosystem and the hierarchy,\" Snead said in early February. The Rams general manager also added that he's hoping to negotiate a win-win contract with Nacua so that the Rams have some money left over to pay other guys. \n\"There are also so many variables,\" Snead said of negotiating this type of contract. \"There are other players whose contracts are up. Maybe there are so many variables that go into to that make it more complex than it would seem on the surface level. Similar to a few players we've had in the past that have been at that level in the ecosystem, you have to begin communication and begin working through it to come up with win-win solution.\"The Nacua negotiation and the Smith-Njigba negotiation are almost certainly going to have an impact on each other, which is why the Rams will be paying close attention to the Seahawks and the Seahawks will be paying close attention to the Rams. If Nacua gets a deal first that makes him the highest-paid receiver in the NFL, then Smith-Njigba will likely turn around and look to top that number. If JSN gets his deal first, then Nacua may look to top that number, and due to that dynamic, that would explain why Smith-Njigba isn't in any rush to get his deal done. If Nacua gets his new contrac first, that will likely mean even more money for JSN. In this case, being patient could pay off big for Smith-Njigba. \nOf course, the Seahawks could always try and talk JSN into playing for nothing, which he almost seems open to. Almost. \"I would play this game for free,\" Smith-Njigba said on WFAA. \"I love this game so much, but you don't have to [play for free]. I'm learning to be a good businessman and we need that check at the end of the day.\"If Smith-Njigba gets an extension done this offseason, his next check could end up being worth more than his entire rookie contract. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        To be the best, you have to beat the best. That was the formula for Duke over the weekend, as the Blue Devils took down Michigan in a marquee non-conference showdown. In the wake of that colossal victory, Jon Scheyer's squad replaced the Wolverines atop the AP Top 25 poll. Monday's rankings placed Duke in the No. 1 spot for the first time this season and set the ACC frontrunner up as the new favorite to secure the top overall seed in next month's NCAA Tournament.Michigan did not tumble far, though. The Wolverines check in at No. 3 this week on the heels of their second loss of the year. They still control their own destiny in the Big Ten title race, and a mere five-point defeat against a national championship contender should not diminish their potential to make a Final Four run.Things are slightly more concerning at Houston after a two-loss week. The Cougars entered their matchups against Iowa State and Arizona ranked No. 2 nationally and had an opportunity to stake their claim to the top spot, but they fell short in both tests and suddenly have work to do in the hunt for a third consecutive Big 12 crown. Kelvin Sampson's crew slipped to No. 5 in the rankings after its season loss total doubled in the span of just four days.Further down the pecking order, UConn dropped to No. 6 following a rough home loss to Creighton. Kansas is also on a downward trend following two losses in its last three outings, and AP voters downgraded it to No. 14.\nMeanwhile, Miami (Ohio) is now the highest-ranked mid-major team after it added two more wins to its perfect tally. With just four regular-season games remaining, the RedHawks are 27-0. Their climb was aided by Saint Louis' 18-game winning streak coming to an end.\n        \n            \n                Bracketology: Houston's Monday night showdown at Kansas is critical for Cougars' No. 1 seed aspirations\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAP Top 25The top 25 teams in The Associated Press' college basketball poll, with first-place votes in parentheses, records through Sunday, total points based on 25 points for a first-place vote through one point for a 25th-place vote and last week's ranking:\n\tRank\t\tTeam\t\tRecord\t\tPoints\t\tPrev.\t \t1\t\tDuke (56)\t\t25-2\t\t1,520\t\t3\t\t2\t\tArizona (5)\t\t25-2\t\t1,439\t\t4\t\t3\t\tMichigan\t\t25-2\t\t1,433\t\t1\t\t4\t\tIowa State\t\t23-4\t\t1,272\t\t6\t\t5\t\tHouston\t\t23-4\t\t1,251\t\t2\t\t6\t\tUConn\t\t25-3\t\t1,211\t\t5\t\t7\t\tFlorida\t\t21-6\t\t1,112\t\t12\t\t8\t\tPurdue\t\t22-5\t\t1,062\t\t7\t\t9\t\tGonzaga\t\t27-2\t\t1,039\t\t11\t\t10\t\tIllinois\t\t22-6\t\t895\t\t10\t\t11\t\tVirginia\t\t24-3\t\t884\t\t14\t\t12\t\tNebraska\t\t23-4\t\t858\t\t9\t\t13\t\tMichigan State\t\t22-5\t\t856\t\t15\t\t14\t\tKansas\t\t20-7\t\t774\t\t8\t\t15\t\tSt. John's\t\t22-5\t\t763\t\t17\t\t16\t\tTexas Tech\t\t20-7\t\t592\t\t13\t\t17\t\tAlabama\t\t20-7\t\t402\t\t25\t\t18\t\tNorth Carolina\t\t21-6\t\t388\t\t16\t\t19\t\tBYU\t\t20-7\t\t361\t\t23\t\t20\t\tArkansas\t\t20-7\t\t356\t\t20\t\t21\t\tMiami (Ohio)\t\t27-0\t\t335\t\t22\t\t22\t\tTennessee\t\t20-7\t\t288\t\tNR\t\t23\t\tSaint Louis\t\t25-2\t\t242\t\t18\t\t24\t\tLouisville\t\t20-7\t\t186\t\t21\t\t25\t\tVanderbilt\t\t21-6\t\t171\t\t19\tOthers receiving votes: Wisconsin (47), Saint Mary's (30), Villanova (15), Miami (10), Utah St. (8), NC State (7), SMU (4), Texas A&M (3), Iowa (3), UCF (3), High Point (2), Stephen F Austin (2), Navy (1). \n            ",

Duke, fresh off of its win against former No. 1 Michigan, ascended to the top spot in this week's Coaches Poll. The Wolverines didn't fall too far, as they checked in at No. 3 The Blue Devils, meanwhile, jumped past Michigan and Houston, which lost a pair of battles against top-10 opponents last week. Duke, led by star freshman Cameron Boozer, who scored 18 points in the win against Michigan, is pushing for the top overall seed in the NCAA Tournament. The Blue Devils have only lost once (to top rival North Carolina) since the start of the new year and nine of their last 10 wins have come by at least 13 points. Elsewhere, reigning national champion Florida continues to dominate in SEC play after struggling a bit against a tough non-conference slate. The Gators, who returned to the top 10 by leaping four spots to No. 7 are running away with the conference race at 12-2 in league play. The next three teams -- Alabama, Arkansas and Tennessee -- are all tied at 10-4. \nFlorida is riding a seven-game winning streak. The Gators boast an average margin of victory of 21.6 points per game in that span. Here's a look at the Feb. 23 Coaches Poll in its entirety.First-place votes in parenthesis\nCoaches Poll Duke (27) Arizona (4)MichiganHoustonIowa StateUConnFloridaPurdueGonzagaNebraskaIllinoisVirginia Michigan State Kansas St. John's Texas TechArkansasAlabamaNorth CarolinaLouisvilleVanderbiltTennesseeBYU Saint LouisMiami (OH) Others receiving votes: Wisconsin 35; Villanova 25; Georgia 18; Utah State 7; Iowa 6; Saint Mary's 5; Miami (FL) 5; Clemson 1\n            \n",

The Thunder and Spurs punched their tickets to the semifinals on Wednesday night, and they'll join the Knicks and Magic as the four teams in Las Vegas. The semifinals are set for Saturday before the title game on Tuesday night.The Thunder improved to 24-1 with a blowout win over the Suns on Wednesday. They tied the 2015-16 Warriors for the best 25-game start in NBA history and handed the Suns their worst loss in franchise history (49 points). The Spurs, meanwhile, took care of Luka Dončić, LeBron James and the Lakers without Victor Wembanyama. It remains to be seen if Wemby, who has missed a month with a calf strain, will suit up for the semifinal tilt against OKC.In the East, the Magic and Knicks were both victorious on Tuesday night. The Magic rallied after giving up the first 15 points to the Heat to come back and defeat their in-state rival. The Knicks got 35 points from Jalen Brunson in a road win against the Raptors. The Thunder are currently the favorites to win the 2025 NBA Cup (-225 at FanDuel).

Moore, who was fired for cause for engaging in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member, was detained by the Saline (Mich.) Police Department and turned over to police in Pittsfield Township for \"an investigation into potential charges,\" the Saline Police Department said in a statement to ESPN. \"The City of Saline Police Department assisted in locating and detaining former University of Michigan football coach Sherrone Moore,\" the statement read. \"Mr. Moore was turned over to the Pittsfield Township Police Department for investigation into potential charges.\"According to a statement from the Pittsfield Police Department, officers responded to a location at 4:10 p.m. Wednesday \"for the purposes of investigating an alleged assault.\" A suspect in the case \"was taken into custody\" and \"this incident does not appear to be random in nature,\" the statement says. An investigation is ongoing and no charges have been formally filed. Moore was not named in the statement. \"This incident does not appear to be random in nature, and there appears to be no ongoing threat to the community. The suspect was lodged at the Washtenaw County Jail pending review of charges by the Washtenaw County Prosecutor,\" the statement says. \"At this time, the investigation is ongoing.

He finished 16-8 (11-6 Big Ten) in his two seasons with the program. Moore had been on Michigan's staff since the 2018, when he was hired as the tight ends coach. He ascended to offensive coordinator before succeeding Harbaugh. Moore had a buyout of around $14 million, but because he was fired for cause, Michigan may be off the hook for nearly all of it. \nMichigan went 9-3 this season and is slated to play Texas in the Citrus Bowl on Dec. 31. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        As soon as it seemed like the college football coaching carousel was finally slowing down, Michigan announced it had fired Sherrone Moore for cause after an investigation revealed an inappropriate relationship with a staffer. The Wolverines becoming a late entry to the coaching search fray throws a real wrench in this offseason. We saw a ton of coaches sign fresh contract extensions after turning down openings at Penn State, Florida and Auburn, but Michigan may be a different beast. It is one of the best jobs in the country in terms of resources, and teams with a top-tier coach they haven't locked into an extension already may have to get ready to fight to keep their coach in town. Michigan hired Moore to keep things on track after Jim Harbaugh left for the NFL, but they never quite reached those same heights, falling short of the Playoff in Moore's two seasons at the helm. Getting back to the Playoff and contending for Big Ten championships will be the expectation for another coach, and with Michigan clear of the NCAA investigation into Connor Stalions and the sign-stealing scandal, they should be viewed as one of the nation's top jobs. Who will be Michigan's top candidates after starting a late search? Let's dive into the names they'll be pursuing. \n\n        \n            \n                Michigan's next coach won't just have to win, he must rehab a blue blood's tarnished reputation\n                \n                    Shehan Jeyarajah                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n    \n                                        \n    Kalen DeBoer, Alabama coachDeBoer's been on and off of the hot seat at Alabama, and he is expected to be the top target for the Wolverines. The Crimson Tide snuck into the College Football Playoff as the 9-seed, but after a lopsided loss to Georgia in the SEC title game, there are still skeptics in Tuscaloosa that DeBoer is the right man for the job. The expectations following Nick Saban were always going to be nearly impossible to meet for DeBoer, and if he were looking for a soft landing before the Tide faithful can run him out of town, he'd be hard-pressed to find a better option than Michigan. The Wolverines have tons of financial resources, an elite young quarterback in Bryce Underwood and plenty of desire to close the gap on their hated rivals in Columbus. DeBoer is a midwest guy and might view Michigan as a better long-term fit on a personal level. When he was at Washington, Michigan was always regarded as a spot where DeBoer could jump. Alabama came open first, and here we are. \nAt this point in the carousel, with so many top names inking contract extensions or already taking other jobs, Michigan won't have its pick of the litter as it might in a normal situation. DeBoer represents their best chance to land one of the country's best coaches with experience heading up a Playoff program, and they will likely make a strong run at him. It's worth noting that DeBoer's Alabama buyout would only cost the Wolverines $4 million, according to CBS Sports' Brandon Marcello. The most fascinating thing to watch will be how hard Alabama fights to keep DeBoer in Tuscaloosa. They could certainly match just about any offer Michigan could come up with, but they will have to decide if they want to make that kind of commitment or take a spin around the carousel themselves. \n    \n                                        \n    Marcus Freeman, Notre Dame coachFreeman has been a name floating around a lot this year, and most recently he has been picking up a bunch of buzz about a potential leap to the NFL. It remains to be seen whether he has a desire to take his talents to the professional level, but if Freeman is at all unhappy with his situation at Notre Dame and looking for an exit, Michigan would certainly make for an interesting home. \nIt should be noted that much of Freeman's experience has been at two of Michigan's longtime rivals. He played at Ohio State and has been at Notre Dame since 2021 as defensive coordinator for Brian Kelly for a year before taking over as head coach. We saw with Kelly that a Notre Dame coach can be wooed away by a big contract and promises of a grander financial commitment. Michigan can certainly make that case, but Freeman would have to really be looking for an exit after this year's Playoff snub to bolt for a hated rival (even if they don't play annually anymore). \n    \n                                        \n    Lincoln Riley, USC coachRiley is another name that popped up earlier in the coaching silly season as someone who might be available for the right price, with questions about how hard USC would fight to keep him. \nThat was before Riley and USC put the finishing touches on the nation's No. 1 overall recruiting class, and he would have to leave what appears to be a bright future in L.A. -- and a huge contract -- to make an in-conference jump to Michigan. That said, there was a time where it seemed impossible he'd ever leave Oklahoma before he bolted for Los Angeles.While the Trojans' recruiting class is packed with tantalizing talent, Riley knows better than anyone how vital having an elite quarterback talent is to success. His best years have coincided with Heisman Trophy winning QBs, and if he viewed Underwood as that kind of talent, getting two years with him would be a very tempting opportunity. On top of that, given the investment Michigan made to bring Underwood in, Riley wouldn't have any concerns about whether the Wolverines will pony up to keep the elite talent flowing into Ann Arbor. \n    \n                                        \n    Jedd Fisch, Washington coachFisch is finishing up his second season as the coach at Washington, and his name has been linked to a few job openings -- most notably his alma mater, Florida.\nFisch is a true journeyman in the coaching business and has ties to plenty of programs beyond the Gators, including Michigan. He made a two-year stop in Ann Arbor from 2015-16 as the pass-game coordinator and quarterbacks coach under Jim Harbaugh and will likely garner at least some interest from the Wolverines, depending on how things unfold with their dream candidates.After turning things around at Arizona, Fisch has taken Washington to bowl games in back-to-back years and appears to have the Huskies on an upward trajectory as well. The one constant in Fisch's coaching career is changing locales, as his longest tenure was a four-year stint as an offensive assistant with the Ravens in the NFL. That's led many to wonder if he might be looking for his next gig, and Michigan would represent quite the opportunity if it came his way.\n    \n                                        \n    P.J. Fleck, Minnesota coachMinnesota has become a very steady program under Fleck's guidance, but one wonders if he'd be willing to flip to the other side of the Little Brown Jug if Michigan came calling. \nFleck's gone 65-44 in his nine seasons at the helm of the Gophers, missing a bowl game only twice in that span and has made five straight. If Michigan can't pry one of those bigger names away from a marquee program, Fleck could be someone that interests them. We've never seen Fleck at a program with the kinds of resources Michigan has, and he could be intrigued to find out what he could do with that kind of investment. At the same time, there is the risk that he's a program builder but not the kind of coach that maximizes elite talent to the level Michigan hopes. That's the question the Wolverines would have to ask, but if they strike out on the biggest names on their list, they could certainly do much worse than bringing Fleck back to the state of Michigan. \nBrian Kelly, former LSU coachKelly got his start at Grand Valley State before going to Central Michigan, and perhaps the Wolverines will look to bring him back to the Great Lakes State after his dramatic ouster from LSU.Kelly's track record of success speaks for itself with a 297-109-2 career record, but Michigan would have to decide whether he's the kind of culture fit they're looking for. It became quickly evident that Kelly did not mesh well with the folks down at LSU, which is why he found himself out of a job as soon as things turned south. They also would have to decide how much of LSU's struggles this year fell at the feet of Kelly and how much were a larger symptom of a program in a bit of disarray. The Tigers were supposed to be Kelly's next great offense but fell flat, and given Michigan is hoping to find a spark on that side of the ball, that would be a bit of a concern. \nIt would be a fascinating reunion between Kelly and Underwood, who was originally committed to play for Kelly at LSU before getting poached late in the process by the Wolverines.\n    \n                                        \n    Where to get more on the Michigan coaching search If you want all of the latest Michigan news and scoop, there's no better place than TheMichiganInsider.

    "body": "\n        We are in the final month of the 2025 regular season, with just four weeks of action still left on the docket. Of course, as we get down to the finish line, these final matchups will carry monumental stakes. Already, the Week 15 slate has a handful of clinching scenarios. The New England Patriots can clinch the AFC East title with a win over the Buffalo Bills on Sunday, while both the Denver Broncos and Los Angeles Rams can punch their tickets with wins. While all we want to dissect heading into this crucial stretch is how these teams match up on the field, injuries will be a storyline. Given that we're so late in the year, just about every team is dinged up to some degree, and that could dictate how some of these games turn out. As most clubs get back onto the practice field for the first time on Wednesday, we'll take the temperature of where they stand health-wise as they release their initial injury report. We'll also look at the final injury report and game designations for Thursday's NFC South matchup between the Atlanta Falcons and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. \nAll NFL odds via DraftKings Sportsbook.Atlanta Falcons at Tampa Bay Buccaneers (-4.5)Thursday, 8:15 p.m. ET | Stream on Prime VideoTeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusFalconsDrake LondonWRKneeOutKyle PittsTEKneeQuestionableJalon WalkerEDGEQuadQuestionableBrandon DorlusDLGroinQuestionableDavid OnyemataDLFootQuestionableBuccaneersSirVocea DennisLBHipOutRashad WisdomSQuadOutCade OttonTEKneeDoubtfulHaason ReddickOLBAnkleDoubtfulMike EvansWRCollarboneQuestionableJalen McMillanWRNeckQuestionableIt's another week that the Falcons will be without top wideout Drake London, who'll miss his fourth straight game due to a knee injury. Meanwhile, Kyle Pitts and edge rusher Jalon Walker are questionable after being limited on Wednesday. On a more positive note, corner A.J. Terrell (neck) was a full participant on Wednesday and carries no injury designation.The Buccaneers are expected to get wideout Mike Evans back after missing the bulk of the year due to a collarbone injury he suffered in Week 7. Despite being listed as questionable, head coach Todd Bowles said Evans has shown everything he needed to in practice to make his return. Both Evans and Jalen McMillan have also been activated off injured reserve.\nBuffalo Bills at New England Patriots (-1.5)The Bills were without tight end Dawson Knox to begin the week of practice due to personal reasons. Outside of that, everyone was accounted for as defensive end Joey Bosa (hamstring, wrist), linebacker Terrel Bernard (elbow), offensive lineman Spencer Brown (shoulder), and Josh Palmer (ankle) were limited. Running back Terrell Jennings (concussion) was the lone player missing from Patriots practice on Wednesday. Defensive tackle Christian Barmore (not injury related) was limited, along with linebacker Harold Landry and offensive tackle Vederian Lowe. Arizona Cardinals at Houston Texans (-9.5)Marvin Harrison Jr. (heel) did not practice with the Cardinals on Wednesday along with offensive lineman Paris Johnson Jr. (knee), defensive lineman Bilal Nichols (knee), safety Dadrion Taylor-Demerson (ankle), safety Jalen Thompson (hamstring) and receiver Xavier Weaver (hamstring). Safety Budda Baker, offensive lineman Kelvin Beachum, offensive lineman Evan Brown, linebacker Josh Sweat, and defensive lineman Dalvin Tomlinson were given rest days. Defensive lineman Walter Nolen III (knee), corner Max Melton (heel), offensive lineman Christian Jones (knee), running back Emari Demercado (ankle), and defensive lineman L.J. Collier (knee) were limited. Houston held out running back Wooddy Marks (knee) and Nick Chubb (ribs) to begin the week, along with linebacker Azeez Al-Shaair (ankle), defensive end Denico Autry (knee), offensive tackle Trent Brown (hand), corner Kamari Lassiter (foot), and defensive tackle Sheldon Rankins (elbow, shoulder). Tight end Harrison Bryant (neck, shoulder), receiver Justin Watson (calf) along with linebackers Jamal Hill (hamstring) and E.J. Speed (knee) were limited. Las Vegas Raiders at Philadelphia Eagles (-11.5)Geno Smith is dealing with a shoulder injury and is unlikely to play on Sunday. The veteran did not practice on Wednesday, which puts Kenny Pickett in line to start in Week 15. Safety Jeremy Chinn (back), defensive end Maxs Crosby (knee, shoulder), and tight end Ian Thomas (calf) also did not practice. Las Vegas designated offensive tackle Kolton Miller to return from injured reserve. He was limited along with receiver Alex Bachman (thumb), tight end Michael Mayer, and receiver Dont'e Thornton (concussion). Philadelphia was without offensive tackle Lane Johnson (foot) and defensive tackle Jalen Carter (shoulder) at practice on Wednesday. Meanwhile, guard Landon Dickerson (calf) was limited. Los Angeles Chargers at Kansas City Chiefs (-4.5)Los Angeles held out receiver Derius Davis (ankle), linebacker Troy Dye (hip), defensive back Elijah Molden (hamstring), and offensive lineman Trey Pipkins III (ankle). Receiver Keenan Allen and outside linebacker Khalil Mack were given rest days, while quarterback Justin Herbert (left hand), tight end Will Dissly (shoulder), and receiver Ladd McConkey (foot) were limited. The Chiefs held out receiver Hollywood Brown (personal), offensive lineman Wanya Morris (knee), and offensive tackle Jawaan Taylor (triceps, knee) from practice to begin the week. Corner Trent McDuffie (knee) was limited. New York Jets at Jacksonville Jaguars (-12.5)The Jets were missing 10 players on Wednesday, which included quarterback Justin Fields (knee) and Tyrod Taylor (groin).

No, that's not about Dak Prescott at the line of scrimmage. It's the first week of the Fantasy playoffs in the majority of leagues, and this is what you've been waiting for all season.    From the draft until now, you've been trying to perfect your roster. All the waiver wire moves and potential trades have set you up as one of the best teams left in your league. And now you have to go win it all.    Are you ready? Are you confident? For most of you, there's probably still a question or two that you have about your lineup, and that's why you're here.    Our job is to help you with those last-minute decisions. But I have one request. Whatever tough call that you make, do it with confidence. And accept the result, even if it doesn't work in your favor.    Don't go into the offseason second guessing yourself if you made a decision using logical reason and doing your homework. Unfortunately, not everything is going to work out in your favor.    But now is not the time to dwell on the negative. We're focused on winning and advancing to Week 16. So good luck in this scoring period, and I expect most of you to be back here reading this column again next week.    \nPick NFL at Underdog Fantasy, where new users who play $5 now get $100 in site credits with promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.

He missed eight games due to injury, which was tough in real life. And, as a Fantasy quarterback, he has just three games with at least 20 Fantasy points in five healthy outings. But things are about to change for Purdy heading into Week 15. He's about to light up Tennessee at home, and then he gets to face Indianapolis in Week 16 and Chicago in Week 17, which are favorable matchups. But let's start with the Titans, who are No. 8 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing quarterbacks. Six of the past seven quarterbacks against Tennessee have scored at least 21.7 Fantasy points, including Shedeur Sanders in Week 14 when he scored 39.5 points. I love the setup for Purdy in this game, and he's a top-five Fantasy quarterback for me in Week 15.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    START

worst game of his career in Week 14 at the Chargers with 240 passing yards, no touchdowns and four interceptions, and he only managed 8 rushing yards with a lost fumble. Fantasy managers are concerned about starting him in the playoffs, but I would trust him in Week 15 against the Raiders. Hurts has scored at least 20.3 Fantasy points in five of six home games this season, and he's averaging 25.2 Fantasy points in Philadelphia this year. And while the Raiders have limited Justin Herbert and Bo Nix in the past two games to 17.6 Fantasy points or less in each outing, we've still had six quarterbacks score at least 21.2 Fantasy points against Las Vegas this year. Hurts should remain a starting Fantasy option in all leagues.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        DET\n                    \n                         \n                        Detroit\n                    \n                                            • #16\n                                            \n                                            Age: 31\n                                                                        • Experience: 10 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        LAR\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    LAR -5.5\n                                    O/U 55.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS QB\n                                \n                                10th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                18\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    QB RNK\n                                \n                                9th\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        PAYDS\n                                    \n                                    3334\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    44\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    26\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INT\n                                    \n                                    5\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    21.5\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Goff had a mediocre game in Week 14 against Dallas with just 18.2 Fantasy points, but I expect him to be in a shootout with Matthew Stafford and the Rams in Week 15. Goff has scored at least 20.8 Fantasy points in three of his past four road games, and the Rams have allowed Bryce Young and Jacoby Brissett to each score at least 23.1 Fantasy points in the past two games. Goff has faced the Rams three times since being traded from Los Angeles to Detroit in 2021, and he's never had a 20-point Fantasy outing. That changes in Week 15, and I like Goff as a top-10 Fantasy quarterback in all leagues.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        NYG\n                    \n                         \n                        N.Y.

That's his worst Fantasy performance since becoming the starter in Week 4, but I expect him to rebound in Week 15 against the Commanders. Washington is No. 4 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing quarterbacks, and six of the past eight guys against Washington have scored at least 21.9 Fantasy points, including J.J. McCarthy in Week 14. I like Dart as a top-10 Fantasy quarterback in all leagues.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        TB\n                    \n                         \n                        Tampa Bay\n                    \n                                            • #6\n                                            \n                                            Age: 30\n                                                                        • Experience: 8 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        ATL\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    TB -4.5\n                                    O/U 44.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS QB\n                                \n                                19th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                19.8\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    QB RNK\n                                \n                                12th\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        PAYDS\n                                    \n                                    2722\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    285\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    21\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INT\n                                    \n                                    6\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    19.1\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Mayfield has not been a good Fantasy quarterback of late with four games in a row with 18.8 points or less, and he's been under 200 passing yards and has no games with multiple touchdown passes over that span. But things should change for him in Week 15 against the Falcons. Mike Evans (collarbone) and Jalen McMillan (neck) could be active this week, which would give Mayfield his entire receiving corps for the first time all season. And he loves playing Atlanta. Mayfield has scored at least 24.1 Fantasy points in his past four games against the Falcons, including 28.6 points in Week 1. Atlanta has also allowed three of the past four quarterbacks to score at least 23.3 Fantasy points, including Bryce Young, Tyrod Taylor and Sam Darnold. This should be the slump buster that Mayfield needs to get back on track as a No. 1 Fantasy quarterback.\n            \n            \n\nSleepers (Start/Sit)\n                        Projections

this will be a tough test for him in Week 15 at Houston. The Texans are No. 1 in fewest Fantasy points allowed to opposing quarterbacks and have held Josh Allen in Week 12 and Patrick Mahomes in Week 14 to 8.1 Fantasy points or less in each outing. Brissett has been on fire since taking over for Kyler Murray (foot) with eight games in a row with at least 20.7 Fantasy points, including tough matchups against Green Bay, Seattle and the Rams. But he won't have left tackle Paris Johnson (knee) in this game, and that makes it even tougher to trust Brissett in one-quarterback leagues. He's only an option in Superflex and two-quarterback leagues.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        CHI\n                    \n                         \n                        Chicago\n                    \n                                            • #18\n                                            \n                                            Age: 24\n                                                                        • Experience: 2 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        CLE\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    CHI -7.5\n                                    O/U 39.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS QB\n                                \n                                6th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                19.8\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    QB RNK\n                                \n                                19th\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        PAYDS\n                                    \n                                    2908\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    321\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    23\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INT\n                                    \n                                    6\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    21.3\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Williams scored 18.9 Fantasy points in Week 14 at Green Bay, and he's now scored fewer than 20 points in three of his past four games heading into Week 15 against the Browns.

But he only scored 14.2 Fantasy points, and he's been held to 16.8 Fantasy points or less in four games in a row. While he scored 33.9 Fantasy points in Week 1 against Kansas City, the Chargers offensive line has fallen apart since then. Even though the Chiefs have allowed three of the past five quarterbacks to score at least 20.8 Fantasy points, I would only use Herbert in Superflex and two-quarterback leagues. And Herbert has scored 15.7 Fantasy points or less in his past two games at Kansas City.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        DEN\n                    \n                         \n                        Denver\n                    \n                                            • #10\n                                            \n                                            Age: 25\n                                                                        • Experience: 2 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        GB\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    GB -2.5\n                                    O/U 43\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS QB\n                                \n                                7th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                18.4\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    QB RNK\n                                \n                                23rd\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        PAYDS\n                                    \n                                    2954\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    244\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    23\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INT\n                                    \n                                    9\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    20.6\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Nix comes into Week 15 against the Packers having scored 18.4 Fantasy points or less in four games in a row, and he hasn't scored multiple touchdowns since Week 9. It will be tough to trust him in one-quarterback leagues against Green Bay, even at home, since the Packers have allowed just one guy to score more than 18.9 Fantasy points in their past six games, including matchups with Jalen Hurts and Caleb Williams over that span. Nix is only worth starting in Superflex and two-quarterback leagues in this game.\n            \n            \n\nBust Alert (Start/Sit)\n                        Projections powered by\n

games against Marcus Mariota in Week 14 and the combination of Geno Smith and Kenny Pickett in Week 15, but this is still a difficult matchup since Denver is No. 5 in fewest Fantasy points allowed to opposing quarterbacks for the season. We'll see if Love can overcome this defense, and he's hot right now with at least 21.7 Fantasy points in three of his past four games, including two outings on the road at the Giants and Lions. But Love has also struggled in some tough matchups against Philadelphia in Week 10 and Minnesota in Week 12, and he scored 7.8 Fantasy points or less in each of those two games. I'm still starting Love in Superflex and two-quarterback leagues, but I would bench him in one-quarterback leagues in Week 15.\n            \n            \n\n    \n    \n                            \n

a massive workload in Week 14 at Kansas City with 26 carries and two catches on three targets. He only managed 68 rushing yards and 8 receiving yards, but he caught a touchdown. And Nick Chubb (ribs) left the game against the Chiefs, so we'll keep an eye on his status for Week 15 against Arizona. This is a great matchup for Marks since the Cardinals are No. 4 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing running backs, and in the past five weeks, the backfields for Seattle, San Francisco, Jacksonville, Tampa Bay, and the Rams have combined for 133 carries for 712 yards and eight touchdowns and 19 catches for 157 yards and two touchdowns on 23 targets. Over that span, six running backs have scored at least 14.3 PPR points, and I like Marks as a No. 2 Fantasy running back in all leagues.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        CHI\n                    \n                         \n                        Chicago\n                    \n                                            • #4\n                                            \n                                            Age: 26\n                                                                        • Experience: 6 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        CLE\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    CHI -7.5\n                                    O/U 39.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS RB\n                                \n                                12th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                11.1\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    RB RNK\n                                \n                                20th\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    837\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    28\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    256\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    6\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    14.1\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Swift is worth using as a No. 2 Fantasy running back in Week 15 against the Browns, and Kyle Monangai should be considered a high-end flex.

He had at least 14 total touches in each game, and hopefully that continues in Week 15 against Buffalo. He didn't do much in the first game against the Bills in Week 5 with six carries for 24 yards and two catches for 3 yards on three targets, but he was sharing touches with Stevenson and Antonio Gibson then. Stevenson will have a prominent role in this game, and he scored two touchdowns against Buffalo in the first game, with seven carries for 14 yards and two catches for 13 yards on two targets. I like Stevenson as a flex option in Week 15, and he played well in Week 13 against the Giants with 12 carries for 40 yards and three catches for 40 yards on three targets. But I'll use Henderson as a low-end No. 2 running back in all leagues, and Buffalo has allowed a running back to score at least 12.4 PPR points in 10 of 13 games, including two in a row.\n

Chuba Hubbard was the best running back with 17 carries for 83 yards and two catches for 41 yards and a touchdown on two targets. But Dowdle still had 18 carries for 58 yards and two catches for 21 yards on two targets. Dowdle is expected to remain the lead running back of this tandem, and I would still start him as a No. 2 running back in all leagues. He had 18 carries for 53 yards and a touchdown and three catches for 10 yards on three targets against the Saints in Week 10, and New Orleans has allowed a running back to score at least 12.7 PPR points in five games in a row. As for Hubbard, he's worth using as a flex, and hopefully, both running backs are productive in this game.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        NYG\n                    \n                         \n                        N.Y.

In two games prior to getting hurt, Tracy scored at least 16 PPR points in each outing against Green Bay and Detroit, and he had 23 total touches in both contests. He'll continue to share touches with Devin Singletary, who is worth using as a flex, and both have a great matchup in Week 15 against Washington. The Commanders are No. 6 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing running backs, and nine running backs have scored at least 13 PPR points against Washington this season. Singletary has scored at least 10.3 PPR points in three of his past four games, and he has three touchdowns over that span.\n            \n            \n\nSleepers (Start/Sit)\n

(knee) remains out in Week 15 against Carolina, then Neal is worth using as a low-end No. 2 Fantasy running back in all leagues. Neal has scored at least 11.1 PPR points in two of his past three games since Kamara was injured, and he had his best outing in Week 14 at Tampa Bay with 19 carries for 70 yards and a touchdown and one catch for 14 yards on one target. The Panthers are No. 8 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing running backs, and seven guys in the past six games against Carolina have scored at least 13.2 PPR points, including Kamara in Week 10 when he had 22 carries for 83 yards and three catches for 32 yards on three targets. If Kamara plays, then Neal is just a low-end flex at best, but Neal is a solid option in all formats if Kamara is out again.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        PIT\n                    \n                         \n                        Pittsburgh\n                    \n                                            • #14\n                                            \n                                            Age: 26\n                                                                        • Experience: 5 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        MIA\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    PIT -3.5\n                                    O/U 42\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS RB\n                                \n                                15th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                10.2\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    RB RNK\n                                \n                                28th\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    371\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    50\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    286\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    6\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    11.5\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Jaylen Warren is worth using as a low-end No. 2 Fantasy running back in all leagues in Week 15 against Miami, and he has scored at least 12.4 PPR points in three games in a row. But I also like Gainwell as a flex, and he has scored at least 16.2 PPR points in two of his past three games. He has at least six receptions in three of his past four outings, and he should continue to be a popular target for Aaron Rodgers. The Dolphins run defense has improved as the season has gone on, and no running back has scored double digits in PPR against Miami in three games in a row against Washington, New Orleans, and the Jets. But Warren and Gainwell are playing well coming into this matchup, and I expect both to be quality Fantasy options on Monday night.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n

 Charbonnet is worth using as a flex option in all leagues in Week 15 against the Colts, and he will continue to share touches with Kenneth Walker III, who is a low-end No. 2 Fantasy running back. Walker has scored at least 13.1 PPR points in two of his past four games, but he continues to lose touchdown opportunities to Charbonnet, who has scored in three of his past five games. Indianapolis has allowed six rushing touchdowns to running backs in the past four games since standout defensive lineman DeForest Buckner (neck) has been out, and hopefully Charbonnet will find the end zone again in Week 15.\n            \n            \n\nRBs to Sit\n                        Projections powered by\n                        \n                            Sportsline\n

touchdown-dependent. He's scored in each of his past two games against Green Bay and Dallas, but he had 10 total touches or less in each outing. And prior to Week 13, Montgomery went three games in a row without a touchdown and averaged 7.2 PPR points over that span. The Rams have also allowed the fewest rushing touchdowns to running backs this season, with two, and this feels like a bad setup for Montgomery in this game.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        KC\n                    \n                         \n                        Kansas City\n                    \n                                            • #29\n                                            \n                                            Age: 30\n                                                                        • Experience: 9 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        HOU\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    KC -3.5\n                                    O/U 41.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS RB\n                                \n                                11th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                9.6\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    RB RNK\n                                \n                                24th\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    515\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    14\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    114\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    8\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    10.2\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Hunt scored a touchdown in Week 14 against Houston but still managed to score just 9.0 PPR points. He had 12 carries for 30 yards and no catches on one target, and Hunt will need to fall into the end zone to help your Fantasy team in this game. The Chargers have only allowed four rushing touchdowns to running backs since Week 7, and they kept the Chiefs running backs out of the end zone in Week 1 when Hunt and Isiah Pacheco combined for 10 carries for 41 yards and four catches for 13 yards on six targets. I'll still use Hunt as a flex option since he has a touchdown in five of his past six games, although Pacheco missed three of those outings with a knee injury. But Kansas City's offensive line woes are concerning, and Hunt will have minimal production if he fails to score in this game.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        TEN\n                    \n                         \n                        Tennessee\n                    \n                                            • #20\n                                            \n                                            Age: 28\n                                                                        • Experience: 7 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        SF\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    SF -12.5\n                                    O/U 44.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS RB\n                                \n                                17th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                7.4\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    RB RNK\n                                \n                                34th\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    743\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    27\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    171\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    4\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    10.5\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Pollard went off in Week 14 at Cleveland with 25 carries for 161 yards and two touchdowns. He had no targets, but it didn't matter since Pollard had a season-high 28.1 PPR points. But I expect Pollard to come crashing down in Week 15 at San Francisco, and he is only worth using as a flex option in the majority of leagues. Keep in mind that prior to facing the Browns, Pollard had scored 8.1 PPR points or less in five games in a row, and that was the first time he scored a touchdown since Week 5. Pollard will continue to share touches with Tyjae Spears, and the 49ers have only allowed three rushing touchdowns to running backs in their past seven games. Pollard's performance in Week 14 should be considered more of a fluke than something you can count on in the Fantasy playoffs.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        ARI\n                    \n                         \n                        Arizona\n                    \n                                            • #20\n                                            \n                                            Age: 24\n                                                                        • Experience: 3 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        HOU\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    HOU -9.5\n                                    O/U 42.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS RB\n                                \n                                8th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                10\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    RB RNK\n                                \n                                35th\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    271\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    22\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    160\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    5\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    8.5\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                We found out Wednesday that Trey Benson (knee) won't return this season, so Knight will likely be the primary running back for the Cardinals for the rest of the year. That gives him flex appeal most weeks, but I'm concerned about his Fantasy outlook in Week 15 at Houston. The Texans are No. 8 in fewest Fantasy points allowed to opposing running backs, and the Cardinals are without left tackle Paris Johnson (knee). Knight struggled in Week 14 against the Rams with seven carries for 16 yards and three catches for 18 yards on six targets, and he should have another disappointing outing in Week 15.\n            \n

He hasn't scored a touchdown since Week 10, and the Vikings will likely continue to use Jones and Jordan Mason in tandem against the Cowboys. Jahmyr Gibbs beat up Dallas in Week 14 with three touchdowns and 120 total yards, and David Montgomery also found the end zone. But prior to that game, the Cowboys had shut down Ashton Jeanty, Saquon Barkley, and Kareem Hunt for three games in a row since acquiring Quinnen Williams and Logan Wilson via trade. I would only use Jones as a flex option in the majority of leagues in Week 15.\n            \n            \nWRs to Start\n                        Projections powered by\n                        \n

targets, but that was a tough matchup. Things get much easier for McLaurin in Week 15 at the Giants, who are No. 3 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing receivers. There have been 16 receivers who have scored at least 12.9 PPR points against the Giants, including one in every game this season. Marcus Mariota will start again in place of Jayden Daniels (elbow), and McLaurin has scored at least 14.4 PPR points in each of his past two starts with Mariota against Kansas City in Week 8 and Denver in Week 13. I like McLaurin as a No. 2 Fantasy receiver in the majority of leagues, and Deebo Samuel is worth using as a No. 3 option.

In his past three games against Arizona, Tennessee and Indianapolis, Meyers has 14 catches for 179 yards and three touchdowns on 22 targets, and he scored at least 14.8 PPR points in each outing. The Jets just allowed Jaylen Waddle to catch five passes for 50 yards and a touchdown on seven targets, and Meyers should follow suit in this matchup at home.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        SF\n                    \n                         \n                        San Francisco\n                    \n                                            • #15\n                                            \n                                            Age: 28\n                                                                        • Experience: 5 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        TEN\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    SF -12.5\n                                    O/U 44.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS WR\n                                \n                                25th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                11.5\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    WR RNK\n                                \n                                22nd\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    41\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    69\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    458\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    5\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    10.6\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Brock Purdy is my Start of the Week, and Jennings is one of his top weapons, along with Christian McCaffrey and George Kittle. Coming into Week 15 against the Titans, Jennings has scored a touchdown in five of his past six games, including two in a row. He's averaging seven targets per game in his past four outings, and this is a great matchup against Tennessee. The Titans are No. 8 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing receivers, and 15 guys have scored at least 12 PPR points against Tennessee this season. I like Jennings as a No. 2 Fantasy receiver in the majority of leagues.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        NYG\n                    \n                         \n                        N.Y.

Robinson has scored at least 12.2 PPR points in three of his past five games, and he has 53 targets over that span. He had six catches for 55 yards on eight targets in Week 1 against Washington, but that was with Russell Wilson under center and Malik Nabers (knee) still healthy. Robinson is the go-to target for Jaxson Dart now, but I also like Darius Slayton as a sleeper. He has scored at least 11.2 PPR points in each of his past three games with Dart.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        TB\n                    \n                         \n                        Tampa Bay\n                    \n                                            • #2\n                                            \n                                            Age: 23\n                                                                        • Experience: Rookie\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        ATL\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    TB -4.5\n                                    O/U 44.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS WR\n                                \n                                22nd\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                13.4\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    WR RNK\n                                \n                                26th\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    54\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    110\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    806\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    6\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    13.3\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                I'm going to give Egbuka one more chance as a No. 2 Fantasy receiver in Week 15 against Atlanta, mostly because of the matchup. Mike Evans (collarbone) and Jalen McMillan (neck) are expected to play against the Falcons, so there could be a target crunch for Egbuka and Chris Godwin, which is something to keep in mind. And Egbuka has struggled of late with 9.0 PPR points or less in four games in a row despite getting at least eight targets in each outing. But the Falcons are No. 2 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing receivers in the past five weeks. Over that span, the wide receivers from Indianapolis, Carolina, New Orleans, the Jets and Seattle have combined for 68 catches for 865 yards and eight touchdowns on 103 targets, and six receivers scored at least 16.0 PPR points. This could be a great week for Egbuka, who had four catches for 67 yards and two touchdowns on six targets against Atlanta in Week 1 in his NFL debut. I also like Evans and Godwin as No. 3 Fantasy receivers given the matchup, but Egbuka still has the most upside on Thursday night.\n            \n            \n\nSleepers (Start/Sit)\n

receiver, but I would only start him in three-receiver leagues in Week 15 at Denver. Watson will likely see a lot of Patrick Surtain II in this matchup, and the Broncos have allowed just five touchdowns to receivers all year. Watson has scored five touchdowns in his past four games, and he will likely need a touchdown to save his Fantasy production in this matchup. In seven games since coming back from last year's torn ACL, Watson has been held under 60 receiving yards four times, and he has five games with five targets or less.\n            \n            \n\n\n

the team this week after being retired since 2020. Pittman would be tough to trust with a healthy Daniel Jones (Achilles) in this matchup since the Seahawks are No. 5 in fewest Fantasy points allowed to opposing receivers. Seattle has allowed just three touchdowns to receivers since Week 7, and Nico Collins, Davante Adams and Justin Jefferson were held to single digits in PPR against the Seahawks over that span.

The Chargers are No. 2 in fewest Fantasy points allowed to opposing receivers, and Worthy is a risky Fantasy option even in three-receiver leagues, especially with Patrick Mahomes struggling behind a banged-up offensive line. Rashee Rice is worth trusting in this matchup given his upside, but Worthy is not worth the risk in the Fantasy playoffs given his body of work this year.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        DEN\n                    \n                         \n                        Denver\n                    \n                                            • #11\n                                            \n                                            Age: 22\n                                                                        • Experience: 2 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        GB\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    GB -2.5\n                                    O/U 42.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS WR\n                                \n                                12th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                9.5\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                    \n                                \n                                    WR RNK\n                                \n                                NR\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    51\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    88\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    541\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    5\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    10.8\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Franklin is struggling coming into Week 15 against the Packers, and he's a questionable Fantasy option even in three-receiver leagues. In his past two outings against Washington and Las Vegas, which are favorable matchups, Franklin has combined for just five catches for 33 yards and no touchdowns on seven targets. He's losing playing time to Pat Bryant, and Franklin still has to contend with Courtland Sutton as well. Prior to Week 13, Franklin had scored at least 12.4 PPR points in four of his previous five games, so he could bounce back at any time. But the Packers have only allowed seven receivers to score more than 12 PPR points this season and just one in their past four games. Sutton is worth trusting as a low-end No. 2 Fantasy option, but Franklin will likely have another down game in Week 15.\n            \n            \n\nBust Alert (Start/Sit)\n

was awesome in Week 14 against Pittsburgh with eight catches for 124 yards on 11 targets, and it was great to see him rebound from his disappointing Week 13 outing against Cincinnati when he had two catches for 6 yards on seven targets and lost a fumble. He won't be that bad against the Bengals in the rematch in Week 15, but I would only start Flowers in three-receiver leagues. Cincinnati is No. 1 in fewest Fantasy points allowed to opposing receivers in the past five weeks, and no receiver in the past four games has scored double digits in PPR against the Bengals, including DK Metcalf, Stefon Diggs, Flowers and Khalil Shakir. Flowers also has just one touchdown this season, which he scored in Week 1.\n            \n            \nTEs to start\n                        Projections powered by\n                        \n

allow Pitts to be the top pass catcher for Atlanta once again.

In those two games, Pitts has 13 catches for 172 yards on 18 targets. He also did well against the Buccaneers in Week 1 with seven catches for 59 yards on eight targets, and Pitts has scored at least 12.9 PPR points in four games in a row against Tampa Bay going back to

touchdown on 11 targets, and he has now scored at least 11.3 PPR points in each of his past two games against the 49ers and Titans. In three starts with Shedeur Sanders, Fannin has 15 catches for 197 yards and two touchdowns on 22 targets, and he should benefit in Week 15 at Chicago if David Njoku (knee) is out. Eight tight ends have also scored at least 9.0 PPR points against the Bears this season, and Fannin has top-five upside in all leagues based on his recent level of play.\n            \n

 \n                    \n                Kincaid returned from a three-game absence due to knee and hamstring injuries in Week 14 against Cincinnati and made an immediate impact with four catches for 41 yards and a touchdown on five targets. He has now scored at least 14.1 PPR points in five of nine healthy games this season, including Week 5 against the Patriots when he had six catches for 108 yards on six targets. New England is No. 9 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing tight ends, and seven guys have scored at least 11.3 PPR points against this defense. I like Kincaid as a top-10 Fantasy tight end in all leagues.\n            \n            \n\nSleepers (Start/Sit)\n                        Projections powered by\n                        \n

tight end in all leagues. In his past two games against the Bengals and Steelers, Likely scored exactly 12.5 PPR points in each outing, but he could have done so much more. Against Cincinnati in Week 13, Likely lost control of the football just before the goal line on a 43-yard reception, resulting in a touchback. And against Pittsburgh in Week 14, Likely had a touchdown overturned after originally being called a touchdown on the field. But he should make up for any lost production this week against the Bengals, who are No. 1 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing tight ends. There have been 13 tight ends with at least 10.7 PPR points against Cincinnati, and the Bengals lead the NFL with 15 touchdowns allowed to the position. I like him as a top-10 Fantasy tight end in all leagues, and Mark Andrews is also a potential starter given the matchup.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        HOU\n                    \n                         \n                        Houston\n                    \n                                            • #86\n                                            \n                                            Age: 29\n                                                                        • Experience: 8 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        ARI\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    HOU -9.5\n                                    O/U 42.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS TE\n                                \n                                25th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                10.3\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    TE RNK\n                                \n                                11th\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    62\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    84\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    574\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    1\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    9.6\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Schultz struggled in Week 14 at Kansas City with three catches for 22 yards on four targets, and he only scored 5.2 PPR points. But he should get back on track this week against the Cardinals, who are No. 8 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing tight ends. Nine guys have scored at least 10 PPR points against Arizona, and Schultz has scored at least 11.1 PPR points in four of his past six games overall. I like Schultz as a top-10 Fantasy tight end in all leagues in Week 15.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        CHI\n                    \n                         \n                        Chicago\n                    \n                                            • #84\n                                            \n                                            Age: 21\n                                                                        • Experience: Rookie\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        CLE\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    CHI -7.5\n                                    O/U 39\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS TE\n                                \n                                11th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                9.4\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    TE RNK\n                                \n                                10th\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    35\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    49\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    435\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    4\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    8.5\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Loveland is playing well heading into Week 15 against the Browns, and he's worth using as a low-end starter in all leagues.

Cleveland has allowed a tight end to score at least 10.7 PPR points in three of the past four games, and Loveland has top-10 Fantasy upside in all formats.\n            \n            \n\nTEs to Sit\n

Goedert was awesome in Week 14 at the Chargers with eight catches for 78 yards on 10 targets, and he scored 15.8 PPR points. But prior to Week 14, Goedert scored 8.3 PPR points or less in four games in a row, and he hasn't scored a touchdown since Week 8. This is also a difficult matchup since the Raiders are No. 4 in fewest Fantasy points to opposing tight ends, and only three tight ends have scored touchdowns against Las Vegas this year.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        LAC\n                    \n                         \n                        L.A.

He's now scored 6.1 PPR points or less in four games in a row, and he hasn't scored a touchdown since Week 8. Justin Herbert is struggling also while dealing with an injured left hand, and the Chiefs are No. 6 in fewest Fantasy points allowed to opposing tight ends. Only three tight ends have scored at least 10 PPR points against Kansas City this season, and Gadsden is not worth starting in the majority of leagues.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n

a touchdown in Week 14 against the Commanders with two catches for 12 yards on three targets. But in seven games with J.J. McCarthy, Hockenson has four targets or less in six of those outings, with 39 receiving yards his best performance. And Dallas has only allowed four touchdowns to tight ends all season. I would only start Hockenson in the deepest of leagues.\n            \n            \n\nBust Alert (Start/Sit)\n                        Projections powered by\n                        \n

But this is a brutal matchup against the Bills, who are No. 1 in fewest Fantasy points allowed to opposing tight ends. Henry faced Buffalo in Week 5 and had two catches for 46 yards on four targets for 6.6 PPR points. And only two tight ends have scored at least 10 PPR points against the Bills this season, which were Travis Kelce in Week 9 and Mike Gesicki in Week 14. Otherwise, Buffalo has shut down Mark Andrews, Juwan Johnson, Kyle Pitts, Cade Otton and Dalton Schultz, and Henry should have another game with limited production in Week 15.\n            \n            \nDST\n                        Projections powered by\n                        \n                            Sportsline\n                        \n                    Eagles (vs. LV)The Eagles defense was overshadowed in Week 14 at the Chargers because Jalen Hurts had five turnovers, but Philadelphia still had seven sacks, one interception and two fumbles. This should be another good outing for the Eagles defense in Week 15 against the Raiders, who are expected to start Kenny Pickett in place of the injured Geno Smith (shoulder). The Raiders have allowed at least four sacks in five games in a row and have scored 17 points or less in five consecutive outings. I like the Eagles DST as a top-three Fantasy option in all leagues.Sleepers (Start/Sit)\n                        Projections powered by\n                        \n                            Sportsline\n                        \n                    49ers (vs. TEN)Jaguars (vs. NYJ)Bears (vs. CLE)Sits\n                        Projections powered by\n                        \n                            Sportsline\n                        \n                    Vikings (at DAL)\nThe Vikings defense was amazing in Week 14 against the Commanders with two sacks, two interceptions and one fumble recovery, and Washington was shutout. But this is much tougher competition in Week 15 at Dallas, and the Cowboys have scored at least 30 points in three of their past four games, including matchups with the Chiefs and Lions in the past two weeks. I would not trust the Vikings DST in this matchup on the road.Start\n                        Projections powered by\n                        \n                            Sportsline\n

    "body": "\n        Shocking news broke in college football on Wednesday, Dec. 10, when Michigan fired head coach Sherrone Moore for cause, according to a statement from Athletic Director Warde Manuel. Moore went 16-8 in two seasons as the head coach in Ann Arbor after taking over for Jim Harbaugh.

His dad, Rick Minter, was a head coach at Cincinnati for a decade and coached college football most of Jesse Minter's life, so he's familiar with the grind.\" See more candidates at TheMichiganInsider.\nHow to get insider Michigan coaching search updates The rest of the list includes several other exciting possibilities, including a coach who is in the College Football Playoff field.

The reigning NBA MVP didn't play on Sunday, but he's off the injury report as a full-go for Wednesday to lead the No. 2 scoring offense in the NBA at 123 points per game. SGA is averaging 32.8 ppg, which ranks second in the league, while scoring more than 30 points in seven of his last eight games. The Over hit in the most recent Suns vs. Thunder game, which resulted in a 123-119 win for Oklahoma City.

They are 16-7 on the season, despite Victor Wembanyama only playing in 12 games this year, and the phenom remains out on Wednesday with a calf strain. San Antonio has road victories over teams such as Denver and Orlando over this stretch, so it hasn't been simply the Spurs winning at home or over inferior opponents.

Meanwhile, Chicago is 2-6-2 over its last 10 games and 1-3-1 over its last five games.

    "description": "\n        Tennessee is expected to hire Jim Knowles as its next defensive coordinator following the firing of Tim Banks earlier this week, Matt Zenitz ",
    "body": "\n        Tennessee is expected to hire Jim Knowles as its next defensive coordinator following the firing of Tim Banks earlier this week, Matt Zenitz reports. The move signals a major effort by coach Josh Heupel to re-establish defensive identity after a costly drop-off in performance in 2025.Banks, who was dismissed Monday after five seasons in Knoxville, saw his defense collapse this fall. Once a unit that helped carry Tennessee into the College Football Playoff just a season ago, the Volunteers surrendered 28.8 points per game and allowed 395.5 yards on average -- both third-worst in the SEC.Enter Knowles, who after spending 2025 at Penn State, will not be retained by incoming coach Matt Campbell.Knowles' coaching résumé is among the most decorated for a defensive coordinator. Before Penn State, he spent three seasons as defensive coordinator at Ohio State -- including the 2024 national championship season, when his defense ranked No. 1 in the country in both scoring (12.9) and total defense (254.6).\nEarlier stops at Oklahoma State (2018-2021) and Duke (2010-2017) likewise cemented his reputation as a sharp defensive strategist and solid developer of talent. What does it mean for Tennessee?For Tennessee, the hire represents a clear acknowledgment that 2025's defensive collapse cannot be ignored. Bringing in a coordinator with championship-level pedigree and experience retooling defenses at multiple Power Four programs may be exactly what the Volunteers need to rebound. Especially with questions lingering over depth and scheme consistency after a turnover-heavy roster and porous secondary -- which ranked 115th in the FBS in passing yards allowed per game (248.8) -- derailed the season.But the fit isn't guaranteed to be seamless, and Knowles inherits sizable challenges. Transitioning to his system typically requires an adjustment period, a trend reflected in the modest results during his first seasons at Oklahoma State and Ohio State before each defense made significant Year 2 leaps, followed by even sharper refinement and consistency in Year 3. \nHis only previous SEC experience also came more than two decades ago as a linebackers coach at Ole Miss in 2003, adding another layer of adaptation as he steps back into the conference.Tennessee will likely need to lean on the transfer portal and recruiting to fill holes, particularly in the secondary and along the interior of the defensive front. Why Knowles' adaptability matters for TennesseeOne of the more revealing parts of Knowles' career arc is how flexible he has been when circumstances demand it. Across multiple stops, his defenses have reflected not just his own schematic preferences but the realities of the roster in front of him. At Ohio State, that meant shelving some of the three-man front structures and hybrid packages that became staples of his work at Oklahoma State and Duke. The Buckeyes' established four-down philosophy -- and the presence of veteran defensive line coach Larry Johnson deeply rooted in that approach -- forced Knowles to build a top-ranked unit through a different lens. He created a defense that remained aggressive while fitting the strengths of a deep, traditional Big Ten front.\nBut that flexibility has limits. Knowles left Ohio State after a national championship season in part because expanded oversight from Ryan Day narrowed his ability to independently shape the defense. For a coach known for disappearing into the film room and emerging with intricate game plans tailored to matchups and personnel, that autonomy matters. Tennessee could be betting that giving Knowles space -- and players suited to his toolbox -- will unlock the creativity and week-to-week adaptability that have defined his best work.\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers will host the Atlanta Falcons on Thursday Night Football, and these two NFC South rivals have each won 32 games over 64 all-time meetings. Bucky Irving might have only had 18 touches for 45 scrimmage yards when these two teams met in Week 1, but he scored a touchdown that helped the Buccaneers pull off a 23-20 win. He's scored in each of his two games since returning from a lengthy injury absence too, but he's still priced at +115 in the Buccaneers vs. Falcons anytime TD scorer odds from DraftKings. That recent penchant for the endzone is why we're including him among our top anytime touchdown scorer picks on TNF.Targeting NFL player props is one way to approach NFL odds at online sports betting sites for Thursday Night Football in Week 15.

Now, it has revealed its top anytime touchdown picks for Buccaneers vs. Falcons.Best Thursday Night Football anytime TD prop picks:Bucky Irving, Buccaneers (+115)Emeka Egbuka, Buccaneers (+130)David Sills V, Falcons (+475)\nBucky Irving, Buccaneers (+115)Irving was a fourth-round pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, and he began his career playing behind Rachaad White, who had racked up over 1,500 scrimmage yards and nine touchdowns the season prior. However, that didn't stop Irving from earning himself a starring role in Tampa Bay's offense by midseason, and he finished with 1,122 rushing yards and eight touchdowns in his rookie season. He began his sophomore season as Tampa Bay's clear-cut top option, but foot and shoulder injuries sidelined him for two months. However, Irving has scored twice in two weeks since returning to action despite being on a snap count, and the model predicts that he scores 0.65 touchdowns on average, while these odds imply a 46.5% chance to score.\nEmeka Egbuka, Buccaneers (+130)Egbuka was the early-season frontrunner for NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year honors, but a dry spell during a period of struggle for Tampa Bay has him down to fourth-favorite at +650 on DraftKings. He hasn't reached the endzone in a month for the Buccaneers, but he did burst onto the scene with four catches for 67 yards and two touchdowns in his NFL debut against the Falcons. Atlanta's 21 passing touchdowns allowed are the 19th-most in the NFL this season, and the model predicts Egbuka scores 0.57 touchdowns against odds that imply a 43.5% chance to score.\nDavid Sills V, Falcons (+475)You might remember Sills as the seventh-grader who committed to Lane Kiffin at USC back in 2010, but he actually signed with West Virginia several years later and transitioned to wide receiver. Now the 29-year-old has carved out a role for himself on the Falcons, scoring in two of the last three weeks and playing a season-high 93.8% of the offensive snaps in last week's loss to the Seahawks. With Drake London listed as day-to-day with a knee injury on a short week, the model sees value in this price for Sills. It currently has him projected for 0.19 touchdowns on average with London playing, and these odds imply a 17.4% chance to score, but the prospects get even better if Atlanta's top receiver is ruled out.\nWant more Thursday Night Football picks?You've seen the model's NFL anytime touchdown prop picks for several players in Falcons vs. Buccaneers.

    "body": "\nThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers won five of their first six games of the 2025 NFL season and gave the impression that they would cruise to their fifth consecutive NFL South title and the 11th division crown in franchise history. But they've lost five of their last seven contests and are clinging to first place, with a pair of crucial matchups against the Carolina Panthers remaining on their schedule.Before worrying about those showdowns, Tampa Bay (7-6) must take care of business against another division rival as it opens Week 15 by hosting the Atlanta Falcons (4-9) at 8:15 p.m. ET on Thursday Night Football at Raymond James Stadium. The Buccaneers dropped a 24-20 decision to the lowly New Orleans Saints at home last week and are tied for first place in the NFC South with the Panthers (7-6), who upset the conference-leading Los Angeles Rams 31-28, but currently own the tiebreaker.While Tampa Bay only lost to New Orleans by four points, three of its previous four defeats were by double digits. Since their bye in Week 9, the Buccaneers' lone win in five games was a 20-17 triumph over the inferior Arizona Cardinals, who have won just once in 11 contests after beginning the season with back-to-back victories.Two weeks after leaving Tampa Bay's 34-7 loss to Los Angeles with a shoulder injury, Baker Mayfield completed only 14 of his 30 pass attempts against New Orleans last Sunday for 122 yards. The 30-year-old quarterback, who was in the league MVP discussion earlier this season, has failed to eclipse the 200-yard mark in five of his last six outings and finished with fewer than two touchdown passes in six of the past seven.Tampa Bay's struggles have opened the door for Carolina, which has gone seven seasons without a playoff appearance and hasn't won the NFC South since a three-year run from 2013-15. The Panthers fell two games behind the Buccaneers after their 40-9 setback against the Buffalo Bills in Week 8 but climbed back into contention for the division title by winning three of their next five contests.Carolina held its own against Los Angeles last Sunday, as the lead changed four times before Bryce Young connected with Tetairoa McMillan for his third touchdown pass of the game with 6:34 remaining in the fourth quarter to put the Panthers ahead for good. The Panthers also won the turnover battle 3-0, with Rams star quarterback Matthew Stafford throwing two interceptions -- including one that was returned for a TD by cornerback Mike Jackson -- and fumbling at the Carolina 30-yard line while being sacked by defensive end Derrick Brown with 2:34 to play.\nWhile Thursday night's matchup against the Falcons is not a must-win for the Buccaneers, it would leave them with in the driver's seat in the NFC South. Tampa Bay visits Carolina in Week 16 and, following a meeting with the Dolphins in Miami, hosts the Panthers in the regular-season finale.Atlanta (4-9) was expected to be in the mix for the division crown this season but has been in a free fall since posting a shocking 24-14 victory against the Buffalo Bills in Week 6. The Falcons lost five consecutive contests after the upset and stopped the bleeding with a 24-10 triumph over the Saints before it resumed with setbacks versus the New York Jets and Seattle Seahawks.Despite its struggles, Atlanta is capable of making things difficult for Mayfield and the Buccaneers. The club is ninth in the NFL against the pass, allowing an average of 191.5 yards through the air per game, and faces a Tampa Bay aerial attack that ranks 27th (237.8 yards). The Falcons also rank third with 43 sacks.James Pearce Jr. is tied with defensive tackle Brandon Dorlus for the team lead with six sacks and has registered at least one in each of his last five games, while fellow linebacker Jalon Walker is right behind them with five. However, Dorlus (groin) and Walker (quadriceps) both are questionable for Thursday's showdown.The Buccaneers are strong against the run, ranking eighth in the league with an average of 100.6 yards allowed on the ground. They'll need to come up with a big effort against Atlanta's Bijan Robinson, who is fourth in the NFL in rushing with 1,081 yards. The 23-year-old running back was an integral part of the Falcons' passing game in their first meeting with Tampa Bay this season as he made six catches for 100 yards and a touchdown. SportsLine's Inside the Lines team feels Tampa Bay still has a great chance to continue its reign in the NFC South. According to the ITL team's model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, the Bucs currently have a 75% chance to capture the division title, and their chances would increase to nearly 83% with a victory against the Falcons but drop to just over 59% with a loss.The best path to the postseason for both Tampa Bay and Carolina is by winning the NFC South. The model says the prospects for the Panthers as they enter their Week 15 road matchup against the Saints are at 25% and would rise to 35% with a victory in \"The Big Easy,\" but dip below 20% with a defeat.CHANCES OF WINNING NFC SOUTHTEAMCURRENTWITH WEEK 15 WINWITH WEEK 15 LOSSDIFFERENCETampa Bay Buccaneers75.0%82.7%59.1%23.6%Carolina Panthers25.0%35.0%15.6%19.4%The likelihood of Tampa Bay and Carolina both winning this week is high, so a victory by the Bucs in their first matchup of the season in Week 16 figures to give them a massive advantage in the race for the division title as they then visit Miami while the Panthers host Seattle. It would behoove Carolina to win the first meeting with Tampa Bay, as if it does, there's a strong chance both clubs will possess 9-7 records when they square off at Raymond James Stadium in the season finale.But first, the Buccaneers need to right the ship and complete a season sweep of the Falcons on Thursday night. The division rivals opened their campaign with a showdown in Atlanta, and wideout Emeka Egbuka made his second touchdown reception of the game with 54 seconds left in the fourth quarter to help Tampa Bay post a 23-20 victory.Falcons receiver Drake London will miss his fourth consecutive game due to a knee injury, but Buccaneers wideout Mike Evans (collarbone) may make his first appearance since Week 7 as he was activated from injured reserve on Wednesday. Tampa Bay is a 4.5-point favorite against Atlanta in the latest consensus odds, and the ITL team's model is projecting a 26-20 victory for the Bucs.\n            ",

Ngannou revealed on Wednesday that his PFL contract will expire in time for next year's White House card, but it would require fences to be mended with Dana White and UFC.Ngannou left the UFC in January 2023, vacating the UFC heavyweight championship and later signing with the PFL. Since then, he's fought once in mixed martial arts, knocking out PFL heavyweight tournament winner Renan Ferreira. \"The Predator\" is expecting a new fight offer from the PFL, with his contract expiring soon.\"I'm getting very close on the PFL contract [ending],\" Ngannou told \"The Ariel Helwani Show\" on Wednesday. \"They have to give me a fight.\" Ngannou said his PFL contract will expire before the UFC's White House card, which is widely expected to take place in June. When asked if Ngannou is interested in pursuing a fight with Jones, Ngannou said, \"Yes, if that could happen.\"  \n\"Confident, no, but there's a chance,\" Ngannou said about the potential of a UFC reunion at the White House. \"Anything can happen.\" The biggest hurdle for Ngannou vs. Jones is the fighters' respective relationships with UFC CEO Dana White. Ngannou and White have bickered back and forth in the media for years after their 2023 negotiations for a new contract fell through. White has also repeatedly thrown cold water on Jones' campaign to fight at the White House, claiming to not trust the all-time great to be reliable. \nNgannou has boxed more than he's fought in MMA since leaving the UFC. He took former unified heavyweight boxing champion Tyson Fury to a shockingly close split decision in Ngannou's professional boxing debut. His sophomore stint ended far worse, with Anthony Joshua knocking him out in two rounds. Aside from the Jones fight, Ngannou is also interested in fighting Deontay Wilder in some capacity. Wilder recently claimed negotiations for an Ngannou fight were \"warming up.\"\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow turned 29 on Wednesday, but he was not in a celebratory mood. He acknowledged that \"there's just a lot of things going on right now\" during a subdued press conference that also included him sharing new perspective following his most recent injury. \"It certainly doesn't change my desire to win,\" said Burrow, who is preparing for his third game after missing nine weeks with turf toe. \"You know, if I want to keep doing this, I have to have fun doing it. You know, I've been through a lot, and if it's not fun, then what am I doing it for? That's the mindset I'm trying to bring to the table.\" Burrow, on the heels of a tough road loss to the Buffalo Bills, was asked if it's hard to have fun given his injury and the Bengals' 4-9 record. \"Certainly,\" he said with Sunday's home game with the Baltimore Ravens looming. \nWhen healthy, Burrow has been one of the NFL's best quarterbacks since he entered the league in 2020. But health has largely eluded him to this point in his career. \n        \n            \n                Prisco's Week 15 NFL picks: Bills beat Patriots in AFC East battle, Packers knock off Broncos on road\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nA knee injury sidelined him for the second half of his rookie season. Burrow led the Bengals to the Super Bowl the following year, but he sustained an MCL sprain during Cincinnati's Super Bowl loss to the Los Angeles Rams. After rehabbing that injury during the offseason, Burrow missed a significant portion of training camp after he had an emergency appendectomy for a ruptured appendix. A year later, Burrow missed a little over a month after injuring his calf during the first day of training camp. \nDuring the Bengals' tenth game of the 2023 season, Burrow sustained a wrist injury that required season-ending surgery. He returned in 2024 and led the NFL with 4,918 yards and 43 touchdowns en route to winning NFL Comeback Player of the Year for a second time. \"It's certainly something you have to think about,\" Burrow said when asked about risk-reward element of playing through injury. \"That's that's life as a professional athlete, no different than basketball and MMA, baseball. It's what we chose. [We] make a lot of sacrifices, and your body is often one of them.\" \nGiven all of his injuries, it's easy to see why Burrow has decided to put more of an emphasis on enjoying himself for as long as he continues playing. \n\"It's just a reflection on a lot of things that I've done and been through in my career,\" he said. \"I think I've been through more than most and certainly not easy on the brain or the body. So, just trying to have fun doing it.\" Burrow is often compared to Andrew Luck, the former Indianapolis Colts quarterback and No. 1 pick who retired at 29 after injuries had diminished his desire to continue playing. And while Burrow's comments will undoubtedly conjure up more Luck comparisons, he didn't say anything on Wednesday that would suggest that he is planning to hang up his cleats anytime soon. Burrow, who is under contract through the 2029 season, is likely frustrated with his team's current situation. Burrow underwent a grueling rehabilitation process in order to make it back from his toe injury sooner than most people expected. He was hoping that the Bengals would win enough games without him so they could go on a legitimate playoff run when he did return. \nThat didn't happen, however, as the Bengals (who were 2-0 at the time of his injury) won just one game during his absence. And while their playoff hopes are still technically alive, that isn't giving Burrow much solace. \"I don't think anybody's really thinking about the playoffs right now,\" he said. \"That's within reach, but it's on our fingertips, so we've got to keep doing what we're doing and try to get better.\"While the majority of the presser was dark, Burrow cracked a smile when asked about the Pokémon box he received from his offensive linemen as a birthday gift. He was specifically asked what exactly is a Pokémon. \n\"I'll let you research that,\" he said in a rare moment of fun. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The UEFA Champions League's 2025 slate is complete and as the new year approaches, a handful of teams enter Europe's winter break in good standing. Some have already booked a spot in the knockout stages and look certain to clinch top-eight finishes when the competition returns, while others have punched above their weight to dream about a direct berth to the round of 16 come January.Six games into the Champions League season, a few have even begun to build their case as title contenders. The list feels like a somewhat familiar one – last season's semifinalists Arsenal sit atop the league phase table, followed by perennial contenders Bayern Munich and reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain. Previous champions Manchester City, Inter and Real Madrid also crack the top eight and remain the frontrunners for direct passageway to the round of 16, their trophy credentials still quick to spot no matter the ebbs and flows of their campaign so far.It forces the question ahead of the business end of the Champions League season: which ones of these teams are the real deal, and which ones are merely filling in the blank space on the bracket?Champions League tableWDLGFGAGDPTS1.

Kairat015415-111In need of a turnaroundLiverpool (9th), Chelsea (13th), Barcelona (15th)The good news for these teams is that they are still more likely to participate in the knockout rounds than not, while Liverpool can take more confidence from the fact that they are only out of the top eight on tiebreakers. Never say never on a run to the May 30 final at Budapest's Puskas Arena – PSG, after all, went on to win last season's competition despite finishing 15th in the league phase – but it is hard to deny that they each have genuine room for improvement. The Reds, quite simply, have been all over the place this season and should prioritize consistency above all else, while Chelsea's sputtering attack will likely keep them from a trophy lift in the Champions League this season. Barcelona have so far had the most notable fall from grace – they went to the semifinals last season and were well and truly a contender during that run but their defense has been remarkably porous, costing them time and time again. That does not feel like an easy fix, either, between manager Hansi Flick's stylistic choices and the quality of the players at his disposal.\nPretendersAtalanta (5th), Inter (6th), Atletico Madrid (8th)Each of these teams deserves credit for a consistency that has allowed them to rise to the top eight places with two games to go, many of them likely to reach the knockouts with few complications. From there, though, they may have to rely on the luck of the draw – Atalanta's most impressive result of the Champions League season was against an unimpressive Chelsea, which only means so much in terms of a title run. Inter and Atletico Madrid have more star power to speak of but it's unclear if they have enough talent to go all the way.ContendersArsenal (1st), Bayern Munich (2nd), Paris Saint-Germain (3rd), Manchester City (4th), Real Madrid (7th)Admittedly, this is an overly long list but it is hard to rule out any of these teams with so much time left on the clock – and with last season's competition still top of mind. Granted, some of these teams are more realistic contenders than others. Arsenal are the easiest answer to any question about who might win the Champions League next spring, both as the only perfect team left in the competition and as a group with a cohesive idea and a deep squad. Bayern Munich are slowly but surely proving themselves as Europe's elites with a defense-first strategy, while Paris Saint-Germain should still be a contender if they have a majority of their stars around. Manchester City can be iffy but even as Pep Guardiola mounts another rebuild, they manage to win more often than not and just might be able to make a run if things click.\nReal Madrid may be a head-scratcher on this list, but there were elements of their performance in their 2-1 loss to City that offered some encouragement. There is a huge asterisk on this pick, considering it would require Madrid to actually stay on the right track, which is much easier said than done at a club as volatile as that one. Xabi Alonso's intense, high-press approach allowed them to stay competitive against City – and just might be a winning strategy in the long run, too.\n            ",

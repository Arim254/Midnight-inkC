But for Week 7, I couldn't decide who I like more out of Quinshon Judkins and Jacory Croskey-Merritt. So let's feature both.Judkins ($6,000 on DraftKings and $7,400 on FanDuel) should dominate the Dolphins at home. Miami is No. 7 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing running backs, and Rico Dowdle and Kimani Vidal have combined for 41 carries for 330 yards and a touchdown, and six catches for 42 yards and a touchdown on eight targets against the Dolphins in the past two games.Croskey-Merritt ($6,100 on DraftKings and $6,600 on FanDuel) also should perform well against the Cowboys. Dallas is No. 3 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing running backs, and the past three opposing running backs against the Cowboys (Josh Jacobs, Breece Hall, and Rico Dowdle) have each gained at least 150 total yards.I'm expecting both running backs to be popular given their matchups, but I don't care. Judkins and Croskey-Merritt should be two of the top performers in Week 7, and I want them on my rosters on DraftKings and FanDuel.\nFor more of my DFS plays for Week 7, click on this link to SportsLine For more of my DFS plays for Week 7, click on this link to SportsLine.

    "body": "\n        What follows is not hyperbole. It is the truth. Shohei Ohtani just had the best individual playoff game in the history of Major League Baseball. Hopefully you got to witness it -- the Dodgers' pennant-clinching NLCS Game 4 win that completed their sweep of the Brewers -- whether live in person or somewhere on a monitor. If not, just let the stat line soak in. Ohtani came to the plate four times. He made zero outs. He walked once. He hit three mesmerizing home runs. Ohtani also pitched. He threw six scoreless innings and only allowed two hits. He struck out 10. \nDespite having a very quiet first three games of the series, Ohtani was named NLCS MVP after Game 4. Again, let that all soak in.\nWe've known for years that we've never seen anything like Ohtani. I remember in 2023 talking to CC Sabathia and listening to him explain why Ohtani was the greatest player of all-time. I've gone through the old stats before to point out that Babe Ruth's pitching and stellar hitting seasons didn't overlap much. That was three years ago. Ohtani has won two MVPs since then and is going to add another this year. He's won a World Series in 2025 and might very well win another in the next two weeks.This is simply ridiculous.Bill James once wrote that Rickey Henderson was so good that you could cut him in half and have two Hall of Famers. You don't even need to divide Ohtani up. He's clearly a Hall of Fame level offensive player. When he's been able to stay healthy enough to pitch, he pitches at a Hall of Fame level, too. \nIt was all on display in Game 4 of the NLCS. \nJust walk through it chronologically. Ohtani issued a leadoff walk, but then struck out the next three Brewers batters he faced in the top of the first. He led off the bottom of the first with a home run.In the top of the second, he induced two groundouts and a popout from the Brewers' offense.In the bottom of the second, he drew a walk.In the top of the third, he walked a batter, got a strikeout and then a double play. In the top of the fourth, he gave up a leadoff double, but then got a groundout and two strikeouts to strand the runner.In the bottom of the fourth, he homered. It went 469 feet.In the top of the fifth, he got a flyout and two strikeouts on the mound.In the top of the sixth, he got a flyout and two strikeouts. Again. In the bottom of the seventh, he hit another home run.You can't find anyone in postseason history who can compare with that. It's impossible. The following players have three-HR games in their postseason careers: Babe Ruth (twice), Bob Robertson, Reggie Jackson, George Brett, Adam Kennedy, Adrian Beltré, Albert Pujols, Pablo Sandoval, Jose Altuve, Kiké Hernández and Chris Taylor. None of them pitched. No, not even Babe Ruth. None of them.Not only did Ohtani pitch, he dominated the team that had the most wins in the regular season for six scoreless innings in the pennant-clinching victory.\nAnd if you're curious, one pitcher in history has ever had a three-homer game in the regular season. It was Jim Tobin of the 1942 Cubs. He went 3 for 4 with three homers and four RBI. He threw a complete game, too. He also allowed five runs (three earned), though. The bar is raised in the playoffs, too, you know? Teams are facing the best teams in the league with higher stakes than the regular season. You see where I'm going, right? Shohei Ohtani just played arguably the greatest baseball game anyone has ever played.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        VANCOUVER -- Brendan Allen stands in the way of Reinier de Ridder's audition for a UFC middleweight title shot. An impressive showcase at UFC Fight Night is paramount if De Ridder wants to improve his case for a fight with Khamzat Chimaev.De Ridder (21-2) was originally scheduled to fight Anthony \"Fluffy\" Hernandez on Saturday, part of a spiritual sweepstakes to find Chimaev's next challenger. The other half of the equation is Nassourdine Imavov, who beat Caio Borralho last month. De Ridder is grateful that Allen stepped up on short notice, but knows a finish is crucial against an opponent less lauded than Hernandez.\"It still means something beating him,\" De Ridder told CBS Sports of Allen. \"He had close fights with Imavov and 'Fluffy.' At least he has history with top guys. I think if I'm the first guy, of the three, to finish him, that means something.\"There isn't a rigid linear path to earning a title shot. Imavov (No. 2) will be ranked higher in the UFC's official middleweight rankings even if De Ridder beats Allen. Imavov also has higher-ranked wins on his record. But De Ridder will have a couple of things going for him with another win: a 5-0 UFC run in 11 months, and a strength of schedule that makes him a reliable challenger in a pinch.\n\n        \n            \n                Reinier de Ridder thinks he can take down, choke out UFC middleweight champion Khamzat Chimaev\n                \n                    Shakiel Mahjouri                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"I've done a lot this year. Imavov has done a lot as well, of course. I say we could have figured out together here as well. He could have said, 'Yes.' He could have shown up,\" De Ridder said of Imavov. \"I know there are a lot of reasons not to. He just fought, but if you really wanted to figure out who the next guy was, he could have been here.\"Allen (25-7) has a stubbornness to him. It's served him well for most of his career, but sometimes raises eyebrows. Allen claims he has a case for having won his fights with Imavov and Hernandez, despite all official judges and polled media members scoring against him. Most believe Saturday's main event will be competitive, but Allen didn't seem very concerned with De Ridder.\"His strength is definitely weighing on guys and being durable. His jiu-jitsu isn't bad at all,\" Allen told CBS Sports. \"I think I'm pretty good everywhere. Especially when I'm mentally good, locked and focused, I think I'm the best in the world. I think I'll beat him everywhere.\"\nCheck out the full interview with Reinier de Ridder below.\nWhile De Ridder and Allen fight for supremacy near the top of the middleweight division, numerous fledgling contenders are working their way up the ranks. Jasmine Jasudavicius is Canada's next hope for a UFC champion. The country hasn't tasted UFC gold since Georges St-Pierre won the middleweight title in 2017. A win over Manon Fiorot, who recently fought women's flyweight champion Valentina Shevchenko, puts Jasudavicius near the top of the queue.\"All of the above,\" Jasudavicius told CBS Sports when asked if the pressure is stressful or a badge of honor. \"I'm super excited to be put in this opportunity and this place. To be able to do this is unbelievable. I'm truly looking forward to it. Of course, I'm nervous, but that comes with it.\"\"She puts a lot of pressure on people,\" Fiorot told CBS Sports when breaking down the fight. \"She goes forward every time. She loves to take people down and take the back. I punch and move, and fight with space.\"\nBelow is the rest of the fight card for Saturday, along with the latest odds, before we provide a prediction for the main event.

They're submission specialists who stay in your face with high striking output. Neither are elite strikers nor wrestlers, and both have defensive lapses. Their finishing rates are bizarrely identical: both men have five knockout wins, two knockout losses, while Allen (14) has one more submission win than De Ridder (13). Allen is theoretically at a disadvantage fighting five rounds on short notice, but he has main event experience and doesn't struggle with cardio. This could be a very close fight, as reflected by the betting odds. De Ridder has a wider submission array, more consistency and time to prepare. He might not have the sturdiest chin, but Allen doesn't crack that hard. I see De Ridder edging out a close fight. De Ridder via Unanimous Decision\n            ",

Belichick's debut year in Chapel Hill has been marked by a defense-first philosophy and an emphasis on discipline as the Tar Heels adjust to his pro-style system. Quarterback Gio Lopez has shown flashes of potential, throwing for just over 430 yards and three touchdowns while managing a young offense still finding its rhythm. Freshman running back Demon June has emerged as a bright spot, showcasing explosive speed and versatility out of the backfield. Wide receiver Jordan Shipp has provided steady production as a go-to target in key situations. Though the Tar Heels have struggled with consistency, Belichick's long-term influence and attention to detail are beginning to take root as UNC looks to turn the corner in the second half of the season. See which team to back at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets instantly at Fanduel if your $5 bet wins:How to make North Carolina vs. Cal picksFor Friday's Cal vs. UNC matchup, Kaylor is leaning Over on the point total, but he also says a critical X-factor makes one side of the spread a must-back.

    "body": "\n        The Tennessee Titans are starting over. They signaled as much when they spend this year's No. 1 overall draft pick on quarterback Cam Ward. But the rebuild took on an entirely new form ahead of Week 7, when the club also dismissed head coach Brian Callahan.Hired prior to the 2024 NFL season, Callahan made it just 23 games atop the Titans' staff. Replaced by interim Mike McCoy, who served as the Chargers' coach from 2013-2016a, Callahan's departure could mark the beginning of additional changes across the organization. Remember, the league's in-season trade deadline is fast approaching on Tuesday, Nov. 4.\nAt 1-5, the Titans are well positioned to be sellers. One player, in particular, who could be made available: running back Tony Pollard, who was one of the top free agent acquisitions by the Callahan regime, including former general manager Ran Carthon.Pollard remains the clear-cut lead ball carrier for the Titans, but he's averaging a career-low 3.9 yards per carry in 2025. He's also due to earn more than $9 million in 2026, the final year of his contract.\nIf Tennessee looks to move the veteran in return for, say, future draft capital, these teams register as potential landing spots:\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Cincinnati BengalsMaybe the Bengals aren't done, after all! Joe Flacco's upset of the Pittsburgh Steelers to start Week 7 has Cincinnati abuzz (and Ja'Marr Chase well-fed out wide). Why not go all in on the veteran rentals and infuse a bit more depth and juice to the backfield to further help the offense stay afloat until Joe Burrow's potential return? Chase Brown is a high-effort starter for the Bengals, but he's averaging just 3.6 yards per carry, with only two carries of more than 20 yards. Adding Pollard could enable him to excel more as a secondary option.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Kansas City ChiefsThe Chiefs have a pair of veteran backs in Isiah Pacheco and Kareem Hunt, but they've trusted neither with a true, sustainable workload. Rookie Brashard Smith also offers upside on the bench, but this is a Super Bowl contender here. Coach Andy Reid probably isn't going to turn away any potential instant upgrades for his skill spots. Pollard, meanwhile, is a proven and well-rounded back just one year removed from a 1,000-yard campaign in Tennessee. He'd instantly offer a change-of-pace and pass-catching upgrade to pair with the physicality of someone like Pacheco.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Los Angeles ChargersJim Harbaugh's offense just got a lift from second-year man Kimani Vidal at running back, with fellow first-year ball carrier Omarion Hampton sidelined due to injury. Odds are the Bolts will be OK at this position once Hampton returns. Still, can they afford to bet solely on Vidal standing out as the insurance plan while they fight to stay ahead of the Chiefs in the AFC West race? Pollard would represent more seasoned experience to plug alongside the youngsters, and Harbaugh showed in his investment of Najee Harris he was already interested in a deeper group here.\n            ",

Mullen, a former SEC coach himself at Mississippi State and Florida, said he had 0.0% interest in succeeding Sam Pittman, and instead urged the school to hire current Florida State offensive coordinator and former Auburn coach Gus Malzahn instead.\"0.0 interest in Arkansas,\" Mullen wrote on X on Friday. \"Thanks for the shout out though. Y'all need to hire Gus Malzahn.\"Mullen has UNLV off to a 6-0 start (2-0 in Mountain West) in his first season at the helm of the program. Mullen spent 13 seasons as a head coach in the SEC, which included guiding Mississippi State to eight consecutive bowl games. Mullen had served as an on-air analyst for ESPN since 2022.\n        \n            \n                Arkansas coaching candidates: Rhett Lashlee, Bobby Petrino among options on hot board to replace Sam Pittman\n                \n                    Will Backus                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nEarlier in the week, Mullen addressed being linked to potential open jobs and reaffirmed his commitment to staying at UNLV.\n\"I'll be here,\" Mullen said. \"I'm going to be the head coach at UNLV next year. I'll be here. I'm not going anywhere.\" Arkansas fired Pittman last month after a 56-13 loss to Notre Dame, which dropped the Razorbacks to 2-3 at the time. Pittman finished with a 32-34 overall record at the school, which included going 14-29 against SEC opponents during his five-plus seasons as the coach.\nIf Arkansas did give Malzahn a look -- per Mullen's recommendation -- the school would get a coach with experience coaching in the SEC. The former Auburn coach left his post at UCF last fall to become the offensive coordinator at FSU under Mike Norvell. Malzahn helped orchestrate a 31-17 upset win over Alabama in Week 1, but FSU is just 2-3 since that dramatic victory.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Through six weeks of the NFL season, it's hard to find a team who doesn't have a serious question mark. Two weeks ago, we would've been raving about the undefeated Eagles and Bills. Now both teams have lost two straight games. How about Lamar Jackson and the Ravens, one of the preseason favorites? With Jackson having been out each of the last two weeks, Baltimore enters its bye week 1-5 and is in serious danger of missing the postseason. Even the three-time defending AFC champion Chiefs aren't immune. They sit 3-3 heading into a Week 7 home date with AFC rival Las Vegas, though Kansas City is the largest favorite of the week at -11.5.Which teams would you take today to make the Super Bowl? Before the contenders start to separate from the pretenders, unpredictability in the NFL will continue to reign supreme. Week 7's 15 game slate should tell us plenty.

The Eagles struggled mightily on defense last week, and it's uncertain if defensive lineman Jalen Carter (heel) will be available this week.\"I think it's fair to call this game a must win for Philadelphia coming off two straight losses. We've already seen one Eastern Pennsylvania team fire a successful head coach (Penn State, James Franklin), and while I don't think Nick Sirianni's job is in imminent danger considering he most recently won the Super Bowl, a third straight loss will turn up the heat a bit. Coming off a bye week and with a brutal stretch ahead, this game might be a must win for Minnesota as well. This is the type of game where I would bet both sides +7.5 at something like -125 odds and prepare for a close game no matter who wins. My coin flip says Philly's misery continues for another week. Vikings 23, Eagles 21\". See his other Week 7 football score predictions at SportsLine.How to make Week 7 NFL score predictionsIn addition, Cohen is picking one game to fly over the projected total. You can see who it is at SportsLine, and use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for just $1.Who wins every Week 7 NFL game, and which game is a must bet for the over?

    "body": "\n        The available Week 7 survivor pool teams has dwindled even further. Couple that with a number of upsets, including the Thursday night New York Giants win over the Philadelphia Eagles 34-17, and many survivor pool players' hopes are in tatters. For those still alive, this week's schedule does give them a number of options to be able to move on. Among the likely targets for NFL survivor players this week include Packers vs. Cardinals (+6.5), Buccaneers vs. Lions (-5.5) on 'Monday Night Football', Broncos (-7) vs. Giants and Mike Vrabel's return to Tennessee in Patriots (-7) vs. Titans.Meanwhile, the Kansas City Chiefs will look to battle their way back to the top of the AFC West standings when they take on the visiting Las Vegas Raiders. Las Vegas is 2-4 on the year and fourth in the AFC West, while the Chiefs are third at 3-3. Kansas City enters as an 11.5-point favorite, the largest line of the week, so the Chiefs will be an appealing option for those who can still use them.

The Packers are 6.5-point and -341 money-line favorites, making them one of four teams favored by more than a touchdown this week. The Cardinals are on a four-game losing streak, but they haven't lost by more than a field goal during that span. Kyler Murray (foot) is officially listed as questionable after missing last week's game. Even if he can't go, Jacoby Brissett is a very competent backup.

Typical starter Behren Morton left last week's win over Kansas with a lower leg injury and not practice this week in advance of the matchup with the Sun Devils.Hammond appeared in each of Texas Tech's first six games this season, on three occasions filling in for an injured Morton. He played extensively against Arkansas-Pine Bluff, Utah and Kansas and was more than serviceable in the role, combining for six total touchdowns in the three spots. He was excellent on the road against Utah, completing 13 of 16 passes for 169 yards and two touchdowns to go with 61 yards rushing. For the season, Hammond is a 66.7% passer with 411 yards, four touchdowns and two interceptions. The dual-threat weapon also has 231 yards and four additional scores on the ground in the first half of the season.Morton departed from last week's contest early in the second quarter after Kansas edge rusher Leroy Harris III sacked him and landed on his lower leg. He was ruled out for the game and watched the final two-plus quarters in street clothes on the sideline.\n        \n            \n                Texas Tech loses DT Skyler Gill-Howard, a top player on the Big 12's best defense, for season to injury\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhile injuries limited Morton to just three complete games in the front half of the campaign, he has excelled when he on the field. The fifth-year veteran leads the Big 12 in yards per attempt and boasts 13 touchdowns to three interceptions as the catalyst behind the nation's second-highest scoring offense and third-best passing attack.\nThis is the second major blow to Texas Tech this week. Standout defensive lineman Skyler Gill-Howard was ruled out for the year with an injury he also sustained in the win over Kansas. The Red Raiders' defensive front has been among the nation's most formidable units this season but will miss Gill-Howard dearly as he grades as the fourth-best defensive tackle in the country, per Pro Football Focus.The Red Raiders, 6.5-point favorites at FanDuel, battle with Arizona State at 4:30 p.m. ET on Saturday in a clash between a rising Big 12 power and the reigning conference champion. \nTexas Tech remains unbeaten while Arizona State, already with a conference loss, has minimal margin for error in its quest for a repeat title.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        For three decades, there's been an unquestioned best hit in the history of the Seattle Mariners. We don't even need to say his last name or the context behind it. If anyone asked, \"who has the biggest hit in Mariners history?\" The answer was simply: Edgar.After the run by the 2025 Mariners, it doesn't seem like that will be the case anymore. If they win one more game after Game 5 of the ALCS, it will definitely be dethroned. I think it already has been. Cal Raleigh and Eugenio Suárez now have moments that top Edgar's. The Mariners won ALCS Game 5 against the Blue Jays by the score of 6-2, but they were on the verge of losing all three home games in this series and facing elimination. They were losing 2-1 heading to the bottom of the eighth. And then Cal Raleigh homered to tie it, sending T-Mobile Park into a frenzy. A few hitters later -- and no outs later -- Suárez came to the plate with the bases loaded. He clubbed a grand slam.\n\"I told myself, 'don't let the fastball beat you,'\" he said. It did not beat him.  He sent it into the seats. T-Mobile Park status? Madhouse.That was only the seventh go-ahead grand slam in postseason history in the eighth inning or later.The Mariners are now one win away from the World Series. This is the only franchise among the 30 in MLB that hasn't been to a World Series before. The Mariners are one of five to have never won it all, but the other four all have at least one pennant. Not the Mariners. Not yet? \n\"This is the biggest home run of my career,\" Suárez said after the game. \"I've been waiting to have a game like this today and it was awesome to be able to hit a grand slam there to give a win to my team, for the fans. They've been waiting for this moment for a long time.\"The context behind this inning is why these two home runs move ahead of Edgar's hit on my Mariners moments power rankings. Edgar Martinez, the Hall of Famer, was a beast in the 1995 ALDS. He was 12 for 21 (.571) with three doubles, two homers and 10 RBI in the five-game series. This series-clinching walk-off double with fellow Hall of Famer Ken Griffey Jr. sliding into home is an enduring image: \nIt's been said that it was the swing that saved Seattle baseball. It isn't an exaggeration. That really might have done it. It's just that it was only the ALDS. If we're comparing Jorge Polanco's walk-off single in Game 5 of the 2025 ALDS, of course you've got to leave Edgar's double above that. Now that the Mariners are closer to the World Series than they've ever been, the two eighth-inning home runs leap to the top of the list. It's true. Not only have the Mariners never won a pennant, they've never won a third ALCS game before. They lost in six in 1995, in six in 2000 and in five in 2001. Those were previously their only ALCS trips. \"First of all, it felt like Cal's ball was in the air for, like, an hour,\" manager Dan Wilson said afterward. \"But to see that one go over and tie the score. And then after Geno's grand slam, I'm not sure I've heard that building any louder than that. Again, just can't say enough about the fans here in Seattle, just how much they support us, how they come out, how they turn out, how they give us the energy we need. Another phenomenal day from the people here in Seattle. It makes you emotional just thinking about that and just how loud it was at that moment.\"\n\"Talking to a lot of people who have been around here since the 2001 days, they don't remember a time that it was this loud before,\" he added. \"So just an incredible moment, I think, at T-Mobile Park, and you can't say enough about the support we've received from these fans this year.\" Remember, the Mariners needed a furious rally late this season just to win the AL West. They were down seven games at one point. They were down four games on Sept. 5. Those 1995 Mariners stormed back from a 13-game deficit and were down six games with only three weeks left in the season.\"Yeah, it's been so similar, you know, the 1995 and this year, September,\" said Martinez, now the Mariners director of hitting strategy, before Game 5. \"It looks very similar the way we played in 1995, chasing the Angels and this year Houston, and we're in this situation.\n\"It just brought those memories from 1995 back. We just hope that we go even farther this year.\"Suárez after the game said it was a \"special\" run and he's right. The Mariners have never done this before. Not even with Junior and Edgar teaming up for that iconic play in 1995. The list now starts with Raleigh and Suárez. The best news of all for Mariners fans? There's an opportunity to add onto the \"better than The Double\" list in Game 6. And after that, maybe even in the World Series. \nDare to dream, Seattle. The eighth inning of Game 6 was the most special inning you've ever seen and proves dreams can become reality. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        No. 2 Miami returns to action out of an off week with a Friday night home game against one of the ACC's top programs, welcoming Louisville to town in the latest test for the Hurricanes' unbeaten start to the 2025 season. With a huge rivalry win against Florida State in the rear view, Mario Cristobal's squad is now focused on finishing strong and securing a spot in the ACC Championship Game, which is the first step to winning the first ACC title in program history.  Louisville also had last week off but entered its break on a far different note, falling in overtime at home to Virginia back in Week 6. The Cardinals got 329 yards passing and three total touchdowns (two passing, one rushing) from quarterback Miller Moss in the effort, but lost the turnover battle and gave up a walk-off touchdown on the second possession of overtime. At 4-1 overall, Louisville can still accomplish its goals of similarly competing for an ACC title, but that likely requires taking down the top-5 Canes in their own house on Friday night.  Bet Louisville vs. Miami at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass with a winning $5 wager:Miami leads the all-time series with a 12-4-1 record, though Mario Cristobal and Jeff Brohm have split their meetings since taking over as head coaches at their respective alma maters. Louisville won 38-31 in 2023 en route to locking up a spot in the ACC title game, then last season Miami got revenge with a 52-45 win in Louisville last year.  \nWhere to watch Miami vs. Louisville liveDate: Friday, Oct. 17 | Time: 7 p.m. ETLocation: Hard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, FloridaTV: ESPN | Live stream: Fubo (Start watching, save $20!)Follow along LIVE as the Hurricanes try to avoid the Friday night upset against Louisville.    Miami vs. Louisville: Need to know   Carson Beck's resurgence drives the Miami offense: Trying to fill the shoes for Cam Ward was going to be no easy task, but Carson Beck has found similar success without trying to replicate Ward's game. Beck ranks in the top five nationally in completion percentage and has done a great job of staying patient behind one of the best offensive lines in the country to dissect opposing defenses. The Hurricanes aren't putting up the same eye-popping offensive numbers as they did in 2024, but when Beck needs to take over he has shown he is capable of doing so like his 4 touchdown, no interception performance in the win against Florida State.   \nMiami defense boasting one of the best DE tandems in the country: The combination of Akheem Mesidor and Rueben Bain Jr. have taken Miami's defense to a terrifying new level in 2025. The group needed a reset as new defensive coordinator Corey Heatherman took over a unit that was falling short of expectations, and with a new scheme and some healthier weapons the defense has become an absolute strength this season. Mesidor and Bain are among the best in the country when it comes to pressuring the quarterback, and their unique advantages change the way offenses have to adjust their play-calling particularly in key downs. Miami ranks second in the ACC and 14th nationally in third down defense, with that pass rush playing a key part.  Chris Bell stepping up in ACC play for Louisville: Louisville wide receiver Chris Bell has been one of the best pass catchers in ACC play, totaling 22 receptions for 305 yards and three touchdowns over the last two games. Bell was a machine in the loss to Virginia, racking up 12 receptions for a career-high 170 yards and two scores, becoming the first Louisville player since 2020 to have 170+ receiving yards in a game. Quarterback Miller Moss has been tasked with shouldering more of the offensive load as the Cardinals have dealt with some nagging and minor injuries in the running back room, and he's responded by elevating his production with the help of Bell's outstanding work at wide receiver.    Miami vs. Louisville prediction, picks   \nMiami has a major matchup advantage here when Louisville tries to block one of the best defensive fronts in the country. The Hurricanes don't do anything too exotic, they just have elite players who pin their ears back, win battles in the trenches and get after the quarterback. That's going to make for a long evening for Miller Moss so even if Miami's offense is a little slow out of the gates over the course of the game the Hurricanes should be able to cover the two-touchdown spread. Pick: Miami -13.5 \n\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Tom Fornelli\n

    "body": "\n        On Monday, Buffalo Bills coach Sean McDermott revealed wide receiver Gabe Davis tore his ACL in the Bills' 27-24 wild card round win over the Jacksonville Jaguars and Tyrell Shavers was being evaluated for a knee injury.Tuesday, the bad news continued to come in: Shavers also tore his ACL, leaving the Bills with just three healthy wide receivers on their active roster: Brandin Cooks, Keon Coleman and Khalil ShakirNicknamed \"Big Game Gabe\" for his previous playoff performances -- including a four-touchdown game against the Kansas City Chiefs four years ago -- Davis, 26, returned to Buffalo this season after spending last season with the Jaguars. He didn't make his season debut until Week 11 but quickly took a prominent role in the receiver rotation. He started five of the Bills' final eight games and finished the regular season with 12 catches for 129 yards.Davis caught two of three targets for 14 yards against Jacksonville on Sunday before taking a nasty hit to his knee early in the fourth quarter. He was helped to the sideline and then eventually carted off the field. He had played roughly half of Buffalo's snaps to that point.\nShavers, 26, had started to come on as an important piece. After catching just one pass last year, he had 15 catches for 245 yards and one touchdown this season. He also had a 14-yard catch against the Jaguars for a key first down.McDermott said Shavers suffered the injury during a punt in the first half but played through it in the second half. He called the effort \"unbelievable\" and \"remarkable.\"\n        \n            \n                2026 NFL playoff schedule and bracket: Dates, times, TV for every round from divisional to Super Bowl\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBills receiver situation vs. BroncosBuffalo has been rolling with a by committee receiver approach all season, though the members of that committee often rotate.\nShakir has been the one constant. The slot man played on 71% of Buffalo's offensive snaps against Jacksonville, the highest of any receiver. He finished with 12 catches for 82 yards; no other player had more than three catches.Shavers (54% snap share) and Cooks (48%) were next in line Sunday. Cooks had three catches for 58 yards, including a crucial 36-yarder on the game-winning drive. Cooks, a midseason addition, has been up and down in his short time in Buffalo, seemingly alternating big plays and drops.The only other receiver with a catch was Keon Coleman, who brought in his lone target for a 36-yard gain. Coleman, the 2024 second-round pick who was a healthy scratch at times this season, played 43% of Buffalo's offensive snaps. He was only active Sunday because Josh Palmer (ankle) was unable to play; Palmer was ultimately placed on injured reserve.\nWith Davis, Palmer and Shavers out, Coleman's role could increase. He's a big body (6-foot-4, 215 pounds) who has flashed the ability to win 50-50 balls but struggled with consistency throughout his brief career.The Bills also opened the practice window for Curtis Samuel, who has not played since mid-November due to neck and elbow injuries. It remains to be determined whether he will be able to play.The Bills also added Kristian Wilkerson to the practice squad Tuesday, and he joins Mecole Hardman and Stephen Gosnell there. Wilkerson has not appeared in a game this season, Hardman has appeared in just two games this season while battling injuries, and Gosnell has never appeared in an NFL game.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Mavericks' star Anthony Davis will be sidelined for at least six weeks as he recovers from ligament damage in his left hand, according to ESPN. Davis had been out for the past two games for Dallas, seeking multiple opinions on if surgery was needed for the injury. It's been determined that surgery will not be needed, per ESPN and he'll be reevaluated in six weeks. He sustained the injury during Dallas' 116-114 loss to the Utah Jazz last week, when his hand got caught in Lauri Markkanen's jersey while defending him under the basket.When the injury occurred, Davis immediately began grabbing at his hand in pain and came out of the game. He walked back to the locker room, but paused for a moment in the tunnel doubled over in pain.\nWhen the Mavericks traveled to Chicago to face the Bulls Jan. 10, Davis was seen in a sling with his hand heavily wrapped. Missing the next six weeks means Davis won't return until after the Feb. 5 trade deadline, but that seemingly won't stop the Mavericks from shopping him around on the trade market.\nIf Davis returns to the floor this season, he could be doing so for a different team, as ESPN reports that Dallas still plans to make him available on the trade market. Given Davis' current injured status, as well as his hefty contract and lengthy injury history, determining what team would be willing to take the risk to take him on is difficult.There was thought that the Hawks could make a run at Davis, especially after they traded Trae Young to the Wizards, which makes them able to take on the $54.1 million Davis is owed this season. That interest may have dissipated with him now out for at least a month and a half.\nIf there is a team out there who still wants Davis, the Mavericks will have to sell low on the big man. That's a consequence of trading for an oft-injured player who hasn't been able to stay on the floor long enough to rebuild his trade value. The Raptors have been linked to Davis in the past, so too have the Bulls and Warriors at one point or another. But at this point, it would be more shocking for Davis to be traded before the deadline than to see him suit up for the Mavericks again this season.\n            \n    ",

    "description": "\n        Antoine Semenyo couldn't ask for a better start to his Manchester City career. Whether he can make the difference in the Premier League race ",
    "body": "\n        Antoine Semenyo couldn't ask for a better start to his Manchester City career. Whether he can make the difference in the Premier League race remains to be seen, but so far, so good. His goal helped break a deadlock and secure a 2-0 victory in the first leg of the EFL Cup semifinals away at St. James' Park. During the entire season, City's attack has been calling out for who would be the second player to look to in the attack after Erling Haaland, and while it's early in his City career, being able to get his first and second goal out of the way will bode well for upcoming Premier League and Champions League games.Rayan Cherki was able to add an insurance goal late, which will ensure that City have a two-goal advantage for the second leg, which will take place on Feb. 4 at the Etihad Stadium live on Paramount+.It's easy to look past Semenyo getting a goal in a match where City scored 10 at the weekend in the FA Cup, but in an away trip to face Newcastle, opportunities were hard to come by, and when City needed him most, Semenyo popped into space to deliver an all-important goal. Newcastle United limited Haaland's impact well, so someone had to step up, and while coming into the season, it would've been expected for that to be Phil Foden, it was the new man who made the impact.\nSemenyo's immediate impact shouldn't come as a surprise as he didn't score 10 Premier League goals with Bournemouth by accident, but his creativity also will bring more to City, too. A master of long throws, Semenyo also has three assists this season and will be able to add more playing with such a talented City squad. The Manchester derby looms this weekend with Manchester United just announcing Michael Carrick as their interim manager for the remainder of the season, and if Semenyo can score in a third consecutive match, he'll go a long way to endear himself to his new fans.City needed a player who could slot seamlessly into the attack alongside the creativity of Jeremy Doku, and they may have done just that. Defenders will be punished for devoting too much attention to Haaland, with a player like Semenyo roaming the wings will make things happen. Only two players, Igor Thiago and Haaland, have scored more goals than Semenyo's 10 in the Premier League this season as his hit rate from the wing has been nothing short of impressive in 20 matches played. The opposition will get tougher now playing in the Champions League, but his supporting cast will also improve with the switch to Manchester.\nAdding wingers hasn't gone well recently for Pep Guardiola with players like Savinho and Omar Marmoush struggling to settle at the Etihad, but the difference in Semenyo is that he's already a Premier League-proven attacker, so he only needs to adjust to the Guardiola way of life and not that and English soccer. Given this start, he's adjusting well to City, and who knows, the Premier League may feel like it's Arsenal's to lose, but the gap is only six points. If City can kick on and make things happen between now and the end of the season, they'll have every chance to reclaim the Premier League title, but any success will need Semenyo to keep his scoring touch going.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The change Philadelphia Eagles fans have been waiting for is finally here: head coach Nick Sirianni is making a change at offensive coordinator and removing Kevin Patullo from that role. Philadelphia took a significant step back offensively with Patullo as the offensive play caller in place of Kellen Moore after he departed to become the New Orleans Saints head coach following the Eagles' Super Bowl LIX triumph. Quarterback Jalen Hurts threw for under 200 yards nine times in the 2025 regular season, which was the second most such games with Carolina Panthers quarterback Bryce Young (12) having more. That's astounding considering Hurts possesses running back Saquon Barkley, wide receiver A.J. Brown, wide receiver DeVonta Smith and tight end Dallas Goedert at his disposal with a stout offensive line in front of him. Barkley averaged just 71.3 rush yards per game this season after averaging 125.3 in his 2024 NFL Offensive Player of the Year campaign in 2024. Brown had zero catches in the second half of a game five times, which is the same amount times the following top wide receivers had combined in 2025: Ja'Marr Chase (one), Justin Jefferson (one), Puka Nacua (one), Jaxon Smith-Njigba (zero), Amon-Ra St. Brown (one), CeeDee Lamb (one) and George Pickens (zero). Eagles last two seasons20242025Record14-311-6Playoff resultWon Super BowlLost wild cardPPG27.2 22.3Total YPG367.2*311.2Rush YPG179.3*116.9* Top 10 in NFL So which established offensive minds will Sirianni pursue in an effort to elevate his squad back to true Super Bowl contention? Here is a look at five potential candidates.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Mike McDaniel, former Miami Dolphins head coachMike McDaniel has already been requested to interview for multiple head-coaching vacancies, so there's a good chance he will remain an NFL head coach in 2026. However, on the off chance he doesn't get one of the NFL's nine vacancies that are currently available, he would be the most coveted offensive coordinator option. His Dolphins offenses averaged 5.78 yards per play, the seventh-best among head coaches in the Super Bowl era (since 1966), minimum 50 games as an NFL head coach.Tua Tagovailoa's connection to Tyreek Hill in McDaniel's first two seasons in Miami, 2022 to 2023, was electric. Hill produced over 1,700 yards receiving in both years, which earned him consecutive first-team All-Pro honors. Perhaps he could do the same with Hurts and Brown if he doesn't become a head coach in 2026.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Brian Daboll, former New York Giants head coachBrian Daboll knows a thing or two about building capable NFL offenses around quarterbacks who have limited passing skillsets. Daboll went to the playoffs in 2022 with then-New York Giants quarterback Daniel Jones averaging 6.5 air yards per pass attempt, which ranked 31st of 33 qualified quarterbacks that season. Barkley still produced 1,312 yards rushing and 10 rushing touchdowns on under 300 carries, 295 to be exact, that year.Daboll could certainly put together a high-flying offense after being reunited with Barkley and having Brown and Smith at his disposal. Rookie first-round quarterback Jaxson Dart looked like a dual-threat dynamo with Daboll calling the plays before his midseason firing, so there's no reason why he couldn't get Hurts looking more like he did in 2022 and 2024 when Philadelphia went to the Super Bowl. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Frank Reich, former Indianapolis Colts head coachSirianni was Frank Reich's Indianapolis Colts' offensive coordinator for three seasons from 2018 to 2020 before being hired to be the Eagles head coach in 2021. Reich was also the Eagles' offensive coordinator in 2017 for the franchise's first Super Bowl championship team. Hiring Reich would give Sirianni a trusted confidant and a coordinator who once upon a time had Carson Wentz playing like an NFL MVP candidate.

Wide receiver Terry McLaurin caught a Washington franchise record 13 receiving touchdowns in 2024 as well. With Daniels missing 10 games because of injury in 2025, Washington took a step back, which led to Kingsbury parting ways with Washington.If Kingsbury doesn't get his second NFL head-coaching job this offseason, perhaps he could come to the Eagles where he could certainly uplift a talented Philadelphia offense. Jayden Daniels 2024 season with Kliff Kingsbury, including playoffsAll-time rookie rankWins14T-1st*Total yards5,4161stTotal TD371st* Tied with Ben Roethlisberger (2004)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Philip Rivers, former Indianapolis Colts and Los Angeles Chargers quarterbackPhilip Rivers is now done playing professional football, but that doesn't mean his time with the NFL is finished. He's been the head coach at Fairhope (Ala.)

If he is, Rivers coming to work with Sirianni to coach the uber-talented Eagles offense would make sense.Sirianni was Rivers' quarterbacks coach on the Chargers for the 2013 and 2024 seasons, and he was Rivers' offensive coordinator with the Colts in 2020. There's a high level of familiarity there, and there wouldn't be a much better opportunity for the eight-time Pro Bowl quarterback to begin his NFL coaching career than with an offense as loaded as the Eagles' unit is entering 2026. \n            ",

    "description": "\n        In about a month, spring training camps will open across Arizona and Florida, and the first exhibition games are five weeks from this Friday.",
    "body": "\n        In about a month, spring training camps will open across Arizona and Florida, and the first exhibition games are five weeks from this Friday. The World Baseball Classic begins two weeks after that. There are still a lot of trades and free-agent signings that must take place between now and then though. Here are Tuesday's hot stove rumors.  Yankees acquire hard-throwing Weathers from Marlins\nThe Yankees have acquired right-hander Ryan Weathers from the Marlins in exchange for a package of four prospects, YES Network reports. Weathers, 26, is coming off a 2025 season in which he put up an ERA+ of 111 and an FIP of 4.08. For his career, he has an ERA+ of 85 and an FIP of 5.03 across parts of five MLB seasons. Over that span, Weathers has made 55 starts and 15 relief appearances. Weathers, who came up with the Padres, has worked exclusively as a starting pitching over the last two seasons with Miami. Assuming the Yankees see him as a starter, he'll join a rotation that will open the 2026 season with Gerrit Cole, Carlos Rodón, and Clarke Schmidt all on the injured list as they recover from various elbow surgeries. Weathers isn't eligible for free agency until after the 2028 season. In 2025, Weathers placed in the 86th percentile among MLB pitchers with an average fastball velocity of 96.8 mph.On the Marlins' side of things, they'll receive a quartet of position prospects in return for Weathers: outfielders Brendan Jones and Dillon Lewis and infielders Dillon Jasso and Juan Matheus. Of those, Jones is probably the most highly regarded, as MLB.com ranked him as the No. 15 prospect in the Yankee system coming into last season. \nCardinals, D-backs complete Arenado trade\nThe Cardinals and Diamondbacks have completed a trade sending Nolan Arenado to Arizona. The Cardinals included cash in the deal and got back minor-league right-hander Jack Martinez in the trade. Erstwhile top prospect Jordan Lawlar has not forced the D-backs to give him a full-time lineup spot, creating an opening at third base. Arenado had a full no-trade clause and had to approve the deal.Arenado, 34, has two years and $37 million remaining on his contract, and like the Willson Contreras and Sonny Gray trades, St. Louis ate significant money to facilitate the deal. Arizona will pay him only $5 million in 2026 and $6 million in 2027. The D-backs get a heavily subsidized Arenado to play third base, and the retooling Cardinals cleared money and a lineup spot.Mets offering Tucker $50M per year\nThe Mets have offered outfielder Kyle Tucker a short-term deal worth $50 million per season, reports FanSided. It is believed to be a three-year offer, per The Athletic. Tucker's decision could come as soon as this week. The three-year offer presumably includes opt outs, in which case it will have been modeled after Alex Bregman's three-year, $120 million contract with the Red Sox last year.\nNow 28, Tucker is the best available free agent this winter. The Mets swapped Brandon Nimmo for Marcus Semien earlier this offseason and now have two open outfield spots alongside Juan Soto. Tucker would improve a lineup that lost Nimmo and Pete Alonso (but gained Jorge Polanco) and also help the Mets improve their defense, which is a stated goal this offseason.The Blue Jays, meanwhile, have a \"long-term offer\" out to Tucker, per ESPN, though the details are unknown.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Giants after second base help The Giants are aggressively pursuing second basemen and have discussed Brendan Donovan with the Cardinals and Nico Hoerner with the Cubs, reports ESPN. The Cubbies have more infielders than infield spots after signing Alex Bregman. Trading Hoerner would clear money and allow them to slide Matt Shaw, a Gold Glove finalist at third base as a rookie last year, over to second.\nSan Francisco currently has Casey Schmitt lined up at second base. He's shown power in the past, though he has swing-and-miss and plate discipline concerns, and is just an OK glove man. Slotting Donovan or Hoerner (or someone like that) in at second and moving Schmitt into a utility role would improve the Giants' offensively and defensively, and help with their depth.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Rangers focused on pitching Rangers GM Chris Young told reporters, including the Dallas Morning News, that \"pitching is a main focus\" right now, and they \"feel pretty good\" about their offense. Texas swapped Marcus Semien for Brandon Nimmo, and signed catcher Danny Jansen, otherwise they haven't done much to improve an offense that ranked 22nd in runs and 18th in home runs in 2025.The Rangers have a strong rotation top three in Jacob deGrom, Nathan Eovaldi, and Jack Leiter. Jacob Latz and Kumar Rocker are the leading candidates for the Nos. 4 and 5 spots as Cody Bradford rehabs from elbow surgery. A back-end innings guy, essentially what Patrick Corbin was in 2025, feels imperative. The Rangers could also use bullpen help.\nLittle interest in Walker \nThere is minimal trade interest in Astros first baseman Christian Walker, according to The Athletic. Walker has two years and $40 million remaining on his contract and is coming off his worst offensive season since becoming a regular in 2019. The Astros have Carlos Correa locked in at third base and trading Walker would allow them to shift Isaac Paredes to first.Walker, 34, has a six-team no-trade clause. His name popped up in talks with the Twins about Correa at last summer's deadline, though Minnesota instead agreed to pay $33 million of the $103 million remaining on Correa's rather than take on Walker as a salary offset. Walker's former team, the Diamondbacks, needs help at first base, though likely not at $20 million a year.  Bichette's meeting with Phillies goes well  \nThe Phillies and free-agent infielder Bo Bichette met earlier this week and the meeting is said to have gone very well, reports the New York Post. New Phillies bench coach Don Mattingly was with Bichette in Toronto the last three years, and, like the Blue Jays, the Phillies offer Bichette a chance to stay near his Florida home in spring training.  \nTrea Turner is entrenched at shortstop, meaning Bichette would have to play second or third base for the Phillies. That would put Alec Bohm, who is a year away from free agency, more firmly on the trade block. It could also force the club to pivot away from J.T. Realmuto and go with a cheaper option behind the plate. We ranked Bichette as the offseason's third-best free agent.    \tYankees open to including opt outs for Bellinger  \nAs the Yankees and free-agent outfielder Cody Bellinger continue their staredown, the team has shown a willingness to include opt-outs in their contract offer, according to The Athletic. New York is said to be offering five years and roughly $160 million. Bellinger and Scott Boras are reportedly looking for seven years. We ranked Bellinger as the offseason's sixth-best free agent.  Now 30, Bellinger is coming off a three-year contract that included opt outs after each season. He declined to opt out after 2024 but did so after 2025. Opt outs have real value, though after his last trip through free agency, Bellinger is likely seeking the biggest payday possible, with or without opt outs. He may never be better positioned to cash in long-term than he is this winter.  \n  \tCardinals still prefer to trade Donovan  \nWith spring training a month away, the Cardinals' preference is still to trade second baseman Brendan Donovan, reports the Belleville News-Democrat. Doing so would net to the team more young talent, particularly on the mound, and also open a lineup spot for top prospect JJ Wetherholt. St. Louis has already dealt away Willson Contreras and Sonny Gray this offseason.  Donovan, 28, has two years of team control remaining, and his versatility makes him a fit for just about any contender. Second base and left field are his primary positions, though he has played every position in the big leagues except catcher and center field. The Giants, Mariners, Mets, Reds, Red Sox, and Royals all make sense for Donovan, among other teams.     \tTwins have interest in Domínguez   \nSeranthony Domínguez, perhaps the best available free-agent reliever, received interest from the Twins earlier this offseason, according to KSTP. Minnesota's relief crew is single-ply thin at the moment. Righties Cole Sands and Justin Topa are the club's most trusted late-inning options. Domínguez, 31, split last season between the Orioles and Blue Jays. He has closed and set up in the past. We did not rank Domínguez among the offseason's top 50 free agents.   \n  Collins attempting a comeback   \nLefty Tim Collins, who last pitched in the majors with the Cubs in 2019, is attempting a comeback, reports The Athletic. He spent the last two years coaching in the Phillies' system. Collins will throw for scouts Wednesday in Florida. Now 36, Collins had a 3.60 ERA in 242 ⅓ innings with three teams from 2011-19, and he was as effective against righties as lefties. He was part of the Royals' American League pennant team in 2014, though he missed their 2025 World Series run after Tommy John surgery.   \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Notre Dame coach Marcus Freeman had already signaled his intention to return to South Bend in 2026 and not pursue NFL opportunities after publicly posting \"run it back\" on social media in late December. That message only temporarily slowed rumors that Freeman would consider leaving the Fighting Irish to pursue an NFL job.Those rumors kicked up again on Tuesday, shortly after Mike Tomlin stepped down as Pittsburgh Steelers coach after 19 seasons, with the announcement that Freeman would hold a press conference on Wednesday. Despite the timing of the press conference announcement, ESPN reported that Freeman is expected to remain in South Bend.Freeman agreed to a restructured contract that puts him in the \"top tier\" of compensation among college coaches after turning down interest from two NFL franchises, Sports Illustrated reported. The New York Giants were among the teams in pursuit of Freeman, CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones previously reported.Notre Dame athletic director Pete Bevacqua said throughout the process he was working on keeping Freeman in tow for the long haul, but understood why interested NFL parties had interest in one of college football's fastest-rising coaches. Freeman's been relatively quiet about NFL murmurs, only once responding to a question about potential interest from various franchises, including the Giants.\n\n        \n            \n                Marcus Freeman will not face charges after Notre Dame coach was accused of battery at wrestling event\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"Well, I think the gratitude you have for being mentioned by an organization like that. I have a lot of respect for all NFL teams, but the history of the Giants is tremendous,\" Freeman said before Christmas. \"It reminds me of the honor I have to be in the position I'm in. You wouldn't have said that statement if I didn't have this job and we weren't having success. It's a reminder for me that the people in our program, the work they put in results in an output that's successful.\"Bevacqua previously acknowledged \"everybody has eyes on Marcus\" given his 43-11 overall record as the Fighting Irish coach, which includes a national championship appearance.Bevacqua is a former executive at Creative Artists Agency (CAA) and was the chairman of NBC Sports, so he has vast experience at the negotiating table. Freeman signed a lucrative extension ahead of last season's playoff appearance and the Fighting Irish were prepared if an NFL team were to try and swoop in.\n\"I would never say we wouldn't match anything when it comes to Marcus,\" Bevacqua said. \"I make sure that he knows that he will be where he deserves to be, and that is at the top, top, top tier of college football coaches when it comes to compensation every year. I view his contract -- although a multi-year contract -- as a living, breathing document that we will revise every year as need be to make sure he's where he needs to be. He knows he has that commitment from me, and more important from the university.\"Freeman was promoted from defensive coordinator to head coach in 2021 after Brian Kelly's departure for LSU. On the heels of last season's run to the national championship, a 34-23 loss to Ohio State, Freeman led the Irish to a 10-2 record this season. After starting 0-2, Notre Dame reeled off 10 consecutive victories before being controversially kept out of the College Football Playoff. After that decision, Notre Dame decided not to play in a bowl game. Notre Dame should enter 2026 as national title contenderDespite losing running backs Jeremiyah Love and Jadarian Price, a couple of offensive line captains a few notable defenders off this season's 10-2 squad, the Fighting Irish will be on the short list of national title frontrunners next fall.\nQuarterback C.J. Carr returns for his second campaign as the starter while there's a strong nucleus of budding talent around him. A favorable slate should assist Notre Dame in getting back to the playoff for the second time in three years as well, given the Fighting Irish's memorandum of understanding signed last spring which guarantees a spot in the bracket if they rank inside the top 12 of the final rankings.Not all dates are finalized, but Notre Dame plays only three true road games -- North Carolina, Syracuse and Purdue -- and has neutral-site contests against Wisconsin and Navy.And with the transfer portal opening Jan. 2 with resources to put toward talent acquisition, Freeman should be able to fill any areas of need ahead of spring camp. Notre Dame's incoming 2026 signing class is rated as the fourth-best recruiting haul nationally, per 247Sports, and includes three five-star prospects -- edge rusher Rodney Dunham (Charlotte, N.C.), tight end Ian Premer (Great Bend, Kan.) and safety Joey O'Brien (Wyndmoor, Penn.).\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Bryson DeChambeau, Jon Rahm and Cameron Smith have all committed to play on LIV Golf for the 2026 season following the departure of Brooks Koepka for the PGA Tour. Talking at LIV Golf's media week in South Florida, DeChambeau noted that he is under contract for the upcoming season while Rahm and Smith stated they had no plans to go anywhere.\"I'm contracted through 2026, so excited about this year,\" DeChambeau said.\"Yeah, I'm not planning on going anywhere, so very similar answer to what Bryson gave,\" Rahm said. \"I wish Brooks the best, and as far as I'm concerned, I'm focused on LIV for this year and hoping my team can repeat as champs.\"Meanwhile, Smith told Golf Digest's Evin Priest, \"I made a decision to come here and I stand by it.\"\nOn Monday, the PGA Tour announced the creation of the Returning Member Program targeted at four members of LIV Golf -- Koepka, Rahm, DeChambeau and Smith. Under the pathway back to the PGA Tour, those players who had won a major championship or the Players Championship from 2022-25 would be allow to play on the PGA Tour in 2026. The transfer window opened Monday and will close on Feb. 2 -- two days before LIV Golf's first tournament of its 2026 season.Koepka mutually parted ways with LIV Golf on Dec. 23, 2025 citing the desire to spend more time with his family. The five-time major champion applied for his PGA Tour membership to be reinstated and utilized this newly-created mechanism to return in 2026 with his first start coming at the Farmers Insurance Open at the end of January.DeChambeau and Smith have both been with LIV Golf since the summer of 2022 while Rahm came over to the league at the onset of 2024. Since then, Rahm has collected two straight season-long individual crowns with his Legion XIII squad taking home the team title as well in 2025. Smith's Ripper GC won the team competition in 2024 while DeChambeau's Crushers raised the trophy the year prior.\nLIV Golf is moving to 72 holes for the first time in league history in the 2026 season in hopes of appeasing the Official World Golf Rankings for its players to earn points from. The league applied again recently for that purpose. Its season begins Feb. 4 when the circuit travels to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. \n            ",

His reputation as an elite prospect took a hit after losing to Jack Hermansson in Pyfer's first main event. Since then, he's won three consecutive fights. A decision win over Kelvin Gastelum -- who gave Adesanya the most exciting fight of his career -- is sandwiched between Performance of the Night wins over Marc-Andre Barriault and Abus Magomedov.\nUFC visited Seattle last February, a card headlined by Henry Cejudo vs. Song Yadong. It marked the first time the promotion had visited the Emerald City in 12 years. Afterwards, White promised the promotion would be back soon.\n\"Let me tell you what, America, Seattle is an awesome city,\" White said during a post-fight press conference in February. \"The people here are amazing. We were walking around the area, lots of different people from everywhere. The shops they have here, the boutiques, the restaurants, the hotels, I forgot how awesome Seattle is. I'm so glad we came back to Seattle.\"White revealed that last year's sellout event at Climate Pledge Arena broke the UFC's North American live gate record for Fight Nights. The 18,000 attendees generated $3.84 million in revenue.\"We will not wait 10 years to come back here,\" White said.\nThe promotion has also booked former UFC women's flyweight champion Grasso against rising contender Barber. Grasso, who famously dethroned Valentina Shevchenko in the first of their three fights, is coming off a last to Natalia Silva. Barber is on a seven fight win streak, most recently beating Karine Silva at UFC 323.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Anthony Davis trade saga has seemingly taken yet another turn. While he had been in rumors ever since former Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison was fired in November, his recent hand injury seemed as though it could end all talks. With Davis likely out until at least March (even though he reportedly will not undergo surgery), the sort of win-now teams that would want a center who's about to turn 33 suddenly had far less reason to pay a steep price to get a deal across the finish line.Yet according to ESPN, the Mavericks are having renewed Davis discussions with multiple interested teams. The idea here would seemingly be for Davis to return during the postseason even after he misses a large chunk of time. If that all sounds a bit farfetched to you, well, it should. Players rarely return from significant injuries in the middle of the postseason. Even if they've recovered, their conditioning is practically never at the level it takes to meaningfully contribute to a postseason run. He'd have to come back during the regular season to get back into shape and integrate into a new team. For now, all we know is that Davis will be re-evaluated in six weeks. That is not the same as returning in six weeks. He might be ready in mid-March. He might suffer a setback that ends with a delayed surgery. Where Davis is concerned, significant risk is always in the picture.Remember, Davis is making $54 million this season. Any playoff team trying to acquire him would have to send out a similar amount of money to bring him in before Feb. 5. What team could afford to send out that much money and feel reasonably confident that it could even survive long enough to get Davis back? Would a diminished version of Davis even be worth the outgoing salary in the 2026 playoffs? There are too many questions here for a true contender to take this plunge.\nWhat this reporting really suggests is that the Mavericks are so eager to move Davis that they're willing to do so for a lower price than we previously believed. The question here is just how low they're willing to go. If they're willing to act as the Hawks did with Trae Young, for instance, and just dump the contract for expiring money, then the Clippers make perfect sense. They could send Dallas around $50 million in expiring contracts between John Collins, Brook Lopez and Bogdan Bogdanović. They'd need help from a third team, and the Clippers would not give up either of their two tradable first-round picks, but if the price is effectively cap relief, they're the only win-now team with the right combination of contracts and desperation to pull the trigger.But I don't think the price is that low yet. If multiple teams really are interested, that's enough to create, well, maybe not a bidding \"war,\" but perhaps a bidding \"skirmish.\" Even if the Mavericks lack external leverage, they certainly have internal leverage. They can just keep Davis, siit him out for the year, tank, get another high draft pick to pair with Cooper Flagg, and then bring Davis and Kyrie Irving back next season planning to try to win. Dallas needs to get something of notable value in order to justify punting on next year's upside, but we've covered why win-now teams would have a hard time justifying that kind of price. However, I do think there's a team near the bottom of the standings that makes sense, one that probably wouldn't mind shelving Davis this season, but should be eager to have him on next year's team.Why the Hornets are the best fit for Anthony DavisSince Dec. 1, the Charlotte Hornets have the No. 4 ranked offense in the NBA. They have a better net rating in that window than the Rockets and Knicks. This is no longer a fluke. Despite the early season LaMelo Ball trade buzz, the Hornets are building something real here. The core of Ball, Kon Knueppel and Brandon Miller will be ready to make genuine noise in the very near future provided Ball can just stay healthy. What that group needs is size and defense. That certainly sounds like Anthony Davis.\nFor a variety of reasons, the Hornets and Mavericks line up almost perfectly as trade partners. Consider the following:Charlotte controls Dallas' 2027 first-round pick, top-two protected. That pick is very valuable to the Mavericks because it opens the door to another year of tanking. However, it is less valuable to the Hornets, especially if Davis stays in Dallas, because they can't control what the Mavericks do. If their options are \"Dallas keeps Davis and is presumably good next year\" or \"cash that pick in now and improve ourselves,\" the latter appears more favorable.The Hornets can afford to trade a pick now. They have a surplus. In fact, they have an extra first-round pick in three of the next four drafts even ignoring the Dallas pick. This year, they're currently slated to get Phoenix's pick from the Mark Williams trade. They'll get Miami's pick next year from the Terry Rozier deal. Then in 2029, they'll get the least valuable of Utah, Cleveland and Minnesota's picks thanks to the Williams deal. In addition, they control all of their own picks.Speaking of their own picks, getting Davis now and sitting him out for the rest of the year would presumably help the Hornets maximize their own 2026 first-round pick. After all, they'd have to send out $50 million or so in salary just to get him. Those are players they could no longer use. Davis could help the Hornets add another premium young player.On that financial front, the Hornets have around $14.4 million in room beneath the luxury-tax line. The Mavericks, meanwhile, are around $16.9 million over the tax line. In other words, Charlotte could help Dallas get reasonably close to ducking the tax, likely within one more move. Most teams would be against taking on, say, the next year-and-a-half of money owed to Klay Thompson. It might make sense for Charlotte solely as a veteran mentor for their younger guards.And our last financial note: Davis reportedly wants a contract extension. Frankly, he lacks the leverage to get one at the moment. If the Hornets could make this trade without giving him one, that would obviously be preferable. However, Knueppel's rookie deal does give Charlotte a big more wiggle room to at least extend Davis for a single season if necessary. As long as he's off the books by the 2029-30 season, when Knueppel's presumably expensive rookie extension kicks in, that's what matters. And hey, if nothing else, Charlotte might not mind having a big expiring salary on its books in a few years. By then the young players might be so good that they're ready to make another significant trade in which Davis could eventually serve as matching salary.So what would a trade look like? I imagine something like this:Mavericks receive: Miles Bridges, Josh Green, Grant Williams, Pat Connaughton, Mason Plumlee, 2027 first-round pick (via Mavericks)Hornets receive: Anthony Davis, Klay Thompson, D'Angelo RussellDallas would have to take on around $50 million owed to Bridges, Green and Williams next season. However, it would save over $12 million this season. A Daniel Gafford trade elsewhere, or some other sort of cap dump, would get the Mavericks below the tax line. In the aggregate, Dallas would still save about $20 million next season as well, and then not have to worry about the $63 million or so owed to Davis for the 2027-28 season or any noise he might make about a possible extension. We'd likely need a third party to step in and take a minimum salary or two just to make the roster balance work, but that's always a solvable problem.Charlotte, meanwhile, would set itself up to enter next season with Davis, that core of Ball, Miller and Knueppel, and fellow emerging younger players like Sion James, Tidjane Salaun, their 2026 lottery pick, and incumbent big men Moussa Diabaté and Ryan Kalkbrenner. Those last two players are notable here. Diabaté has distinguished himself over the past year or so with incredible effort and strong defense. Kalkbrenner has a ways to go, but his size alone makes him a strong shot-blocker and finisher near the basket. Both are probably overtaxed in their current roles, but neither should be excised from the rotation, either.\nA Davis acquisition creates a more suitable middle ground. Their roles would likely be smaller with him in the fold, but not disappear completely. Besides, Davis misses his share of games. They wouldn't lack for opportunities to scale up. Given the shooting Charlotte has assembled, it's not implausible that Davis could play minutes with either of them. It wouldn't be ideal offensively, but Davis prefers defending forwards over centers anyway, so if some minutes with the other promising, younger big men in the fold placates him, well, that works out nicely too.The Hornets probably dug too deep a hole for themselves early this season to make a real playoff run this year. That's fine. This team is young. Another few months of development for those recent draft picks is still going to be valuable for these players. But it won't be long until Charlotte is genuinely ready to win. And when they are, it's just hard to imagine them finding a player that suits their needs better than Davis. If such a player even exists, he'd be substantially more expensive. Charlotte won't have access to the Giannis Antetokounmpos of the world. That's just the reality of their market recent history of losing. Jaren Jackson Jr. might make more sense on Charlotte's timeline, but he'd also cost several first-round picks.But Davis' star has seemingly fallen far enough for him to be attainable for the Hornets for a bargain. He's a basketball fit for their roster, and he'd represent a real vote of confidence in the core that they're building, a signal to the young players that the team thinks they're ready to start winning. Most of the evidence lately suggests that's true. They're just looking for that one last piece to push them over the top. Even if it doesn't come to fruition until next season, Davis makes plenty of sense as that final addition.\n'Why shouldn't the ______ trade for Davis instead?'Think about the teams that have most widely been reported as potential Davis suitors. Atlanta. Golden State. Toronto. What do those teams have in common? Right now, it's their status as postseason underdogs. The Warriors are a No. 8 seed at the moment. The Hawks are a No. 9 seed. Toronto is No. 4 in the East, but only three games ahead of No. 8 Miami.Now think about where those teams would be if they gave away $50 million or so in matching salary for Davis without knowing when he'd come back. Say Toronto gave up RJ Barrett and Jakob Poeltl, probably their best-case outcome in terms of players traded given their oversized contracts. Maybe they could get Davis back in time for the playoffs, but how far down the standings would they fall in the process? Would you rather be a top-six seed without Davis or a Play-In team with him? Even if they don't fall down the standings, how confident would you feel in the Raptors, say, winning a first-round series without Davis before bringing him back in the second round if that's what his recovery timeline calls for?Atlanta, as a No. 9 seed, would face two winner-take-all games before even reaching the postseason... and that's before considering the Hawks playing out the regular season without Kristaps Porziņģis or Luke Kennard, the two obvious pieces of matching salary that would be in the deal, plus whoever else they have to give up. Golden State would at least have a chance at redemption if it lost the first Play-In Game, but imagine the Warriors trying to sneak into the playoffs without either Jimmy Butler (who matches Davis' contract exactly) or basically all of their depth (Draymond Green, Jonathan Kuminga and a few other role players would be needed). Again, that's a tall order.\nThe reality for these teams is that they just probably wouldn't be able to survive an extended regular-season absence from Davis this season, and even if they made the postseason despite his injury, would be digging such a deep hole for themselves that climbing out would seem almost impossible. That makes a Davis trade more of a next season proposition, and if that's the case, what's the benefit of acting now? Wouldn't you rather scope out the offseason transaction market and see if younger, cheaper alternatives are available? Besides, these teams have other needs. The Hawks may have traded Trae Young for cap relief, but that doesn't mean they have enough shot-creation. CJ McCollum is a stopgap. Eventually, they'll need to pursue a younger scorer. That eats into their available money. Golden State needs to balance its present with its future. The Stephen Curry era won't last forever. Could the Warriors justify giving away draft capital deep into the future for maybe one or two bites at the postseason apple? That seems unreasonable. If they're giving up picks like that, it would ideally be for a player who could help keep them afloat after Curry retires.And then there's the desperation tier, teams like the Clippers and Bucks who are set on winning now but have very limited flexibility in pursuing upgrades. We covered the Clippers as a cap dump option, but if the Mavericks want genuine value, there's just no way for Los Angeles to offer it responsibly. A 16-23 team can't justify giving up either its 2030 or 2032 first-round picks for a 33-year-old. The Bucks are in the same boat. The idea here is improving enough to convince Giannis Antetokounmpo he can compete for a championship in Milwaukee. That's already a tall order. If they're giving up all of their matching salary for Davis, they just wouldn't have enough leftover to win with, and they'd be sacrificing draft picks they might need deep in the future to rebuild for life after Giannis.\nSo, really, the groups of teams that might make sense are the ones that could feel reasonably confident that they will survive long enough in the playoffs to actually get Davis back this season or the ones who would be adding him exclusively for next year and beyond. How many teams like that even exist? Boston needs a center but can't make the money work with Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and Derrick White on expensive contracts. Minnesota is playing too well to disturb its current group. Ironically, the best fit here might even be the Lakers. Just mash all of their expiring contracts together, throw in a 2031 first-round pick and call it a day. Dallas would never cooperate on such a deal. The public backlash would be too significant. There just isn't a viable contender for Davis in this moment.That means that younger teams like Charlotte who would have some reason to acquire Davis for the future are our best bets. But who else makes sense? The Nets have Charlotte's draft surplus, but are set at center with Nic Claxton and Day'Ron Sharpe, and they don't have Charlotte's offensive firepower, so they wouldn't benefit as much from Davis' presence. The Bulls badly need a defensive center, but their lone, extra first-round pick, a lottery-protected pick coming from Portland, isn't as valuable to Dallas as what the Hornets can offer, and besides, the Bulls have far bigger, long-term roster concerns to address. Unlike the Hornets, they don't have a viable core in place. A Pelicans reunion ironically makes some basketball sense. New Orleans could use a rim-protector next to Derik Queen in the Zion Williamson salary slot. But after the disaster of giving away their unprotected pick this season, New Orleans can't justify giving away any more first-rounders. Besides, Davis is so expensive that New Orleans would have to include more salary on top of Williamson just to make the money work. This is an organization that has never shown any interest in paying the luxury tax.The Hornets check the most boxes here. They're not the sort of team one would expect to pursue someone like Davis, but the fit is there if you're willing to squint for it. There has been no reporting on a possible deal between Dallas and Charlotte, and just given where the Hornets are on their rebuilding timeline, any trade for a player like Davis is inherently unlikely. But if the Hornets are willing to think outside of the box, Davis could really help this team transition from plucky upstarts to genuine winners as soon as next year.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The cold war between the Big Ten and the SEC is heading to South Florida. As College Football Playoff executives prepare for their annual meeting ahead of the national championship game in Miami, the sport's two power brokers remain locked in a standoff over the future of the postseason, which could leave the playoff frozen in its current format for at least one more season. But behind the scenes, the Big Ten is floating a compromise it believes could potentially break the stalemate as the clock nears midnight on the CFP's Jan. 23 deadline for a decision. The conference prefers a 24-team playoff, with or without automatic qualifiers, but is willing to temporarily accept a 16-team field if the rest of the sport commits to expanding to 24 teams within three years, industry sources told CBS Sports.  The stopgap would buy conferences time to unwind one of the sport's most complicated obstacles: conference championship games, which are tied up in lucrative and overlapping media-rights agreements through at least the end of the decade. The belief is that power conferences would eliminate their conference championship games in the new model. \nThat idea could surface Sunday when the CFP management committee, composed of the 10 FBS commissioners and Notre Dame's athletic director, meets in Miami. For now, the lines are firmly drawn, and the Big Ten is standing on an island. The ACC, Big 12 and SEC continue to back a 16-team \"5+11\" format that guarantees automatic bids to the five highest-ranked conference champions. The roadblock remains the Big Ten and SEC's controlling interest in CFP decision-making. If the two largest conferences don't align, the playoff stays at 12 teams. ESPN, the CFP's media partner through 2032, granted executives in November a deadline extension from Dec. 1 to Jan. 23 to decide on next year's format, but they have made little headway in negotiations. The Big Ten has also explored a different version of a 24-team playoff -- one with just one automatic qualifier reserved for the highest-ranked Group of Six champion with the remaining 23 teams seeded strictly by CFP Rankings. The thinking is that a largely open field could entice the SEC, though the proposal has not been formally presented, sources familiar with the Big Ten's thinking told CBS Sports. \n\"There's no momentum to expand just for the sake of expanding,\" a power conference executive told CBS Sports. \"There's this notion that college sports are really good about being reactionary and taking a short-term gain and not looking at the long-term implications of it.\" The Big Ten previously discussed a 24-team field with four automatic qualifiers for each of the four power conferences, which was socialized with the FBS members. The ACC and Big 12 have long requested equal access, including qualifiers, for every power conference. A 16-team format with unequal AQs -- four for the Big Ten and SEC, and two for the ACC and Big 12 -- did not gain traction last spring and summer. \n        \n            \n                Big Ten's radical idea for College Football Playoff expansion frustrates execs, piques interest from ADs\n                \n                    Brandon Marcello                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBig 12 commissioner Brett Yormark said in October that he would be open to discussing a 24-team field \"if we're on equal footing with our colleagues.\" ACC commissioner Jim Phillips continues to support a 16-team format with equal automatic qualifiers or the 5+11 model, which gained momentum among SEC coaches and athletic directors last summer.\nA 24-team playoff with equal access across the power conferences could still tempt SEC executives, several of whom were open to the idea in the fall. One Big Ten concept would include 16 on-campus games across the first two rounds, with eight byes awarded to the highest-ranked teams.  Quarterfinals and semifinals would remain at marquee bowl sites -- including the Fiesta, Peach, Sugar, Orange and Cotton bowls -- while an expanded neutral-site slate could pull lower-tier bowls into the playoff ecosystem. An increase from seven to 11 neutral-site games would suddenly make the idea of a Pop-Tarts Bowl playoff game plausible. What is losing momentum is replacing conference championship games with playoff play-ins.\"Why add another wear-and-tear game on our players?\" a power conference executive told CBS Sports. \nA 16-team field, however, could increase the need for play-in games in a world without conference championship games. One version of a 24-team playoff would propose moving the Army vs. Navy Game from the second Saturday in December to the first Saturday, which is typically reserved for conference championship games. The 24-team playoff would begin on the second Friday and/or Saturday of December. The ACC entered last week hopeful that a 16-team expansion could still be approved for next season, but Phillips acknowledged that disagreements leading into the 11th hour may prevent that outcome. \n\"We're doing it collaboratively, and I have really enjoyed our conversations,\" Phillips told CBS Sports on Friday. \"There's not friction and people yelling at each other. It's very professional and cordial, but it's direct. We know college football is dependent on us to come up with something that makes sense. \" Complicating matters is that the CFP hasn't held a format steady long enough to truly evaluate it. The playoff expanded from four teams to 12 in 2024. Straight seeding was implemented in 2025. New metrics pushed by the SEC were added to the selection committee's toolbox this fall. Next fall, the ACC and SEC will increase league games from eight to nine, joining the Big Ten and Big 12's models. Simply put, meaningful long-term data points remain scarce. \nThe biggest controversy of the new era was the CFP Selection Committee's decision to drop Notre Dame from the top 12 in December, prompting the program to opt out of a lower-tier bowl game. \"Twelve, like it or not, has worked last year and this year, especially when the seeding was figured out this year after last year's debacle,\" a an executive said. \"It's been proven there's enough quality teams built into the current format that 12 is probably as good of a threshold right now with the current way we do things.\" For now, as they have done for the better part of two years, the conferences will likely continue to agree to disagree, leading to at least one more season of a 12-team playoff. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Russell Henley enters the new season as the odds-on favorite to win the 2026 Sony Open in Hawaii. The American enters as the fifth-ranked golfer in the men's top 200. The former University of Georgia standout will be seeking his sixth PGA Tour win and ninth as a professional. His last win came at last year's Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay   Hill, Fla., in March. This year's event gets underway on Thursday at 1:49 p.m. ET from Waialae Country Club in Honolulu,  Hawaii. The tournament will be played on a par-70 course measuring 7,044 yards. Henley is the +1100 favorite (risk $100 to win $1,100) in the 2026 Sony Open odds at DraftKings Sportsbook. Other favorites include Hideki Matsuyama and Ben Griffin at +1700, J.J. Spaun at +1800, and Si Woo Kim, Robert MacIntyre and Collin Morikawa at +2000. Before making any 2026 Sony Open picks, you need to see the 2026 Sony Open predictions and best bets from golf expert Brady Kannon. Kannon is an elite golfing handicapper with more than 30 years of experience in the industry. He's hit eight major outright winners since 2013. In the fall of 2022, he hit outright winners in three consecutive weeks: Russell Henley (40-1), Tony Finau (18-1) and Adam Svensson (150-1). Last season, he hit Hideki Matsuyama (22-1), Harris English (110-1), Ludvig Aberg (25-1) and Ben Griffin/Andrew Novak (25-1) in New Orleans. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Now, Kannon has focused his attention on the 2026 Sony Open field and locked in his best bets and top sleepers. You can only see them here. Top 2026 Sony Open expert picks One of Kannon's 2026 Sony Open predictions: He's fading Tom Hoge, the 36-year-old TCU grad. He's +20000 in the outright market, and Kannon is staying away from him there and in bets like making the cut and head-to-head. \"The TCU Horned Frog has dipped to 99th in the OWGR and in five starts over the FedExCup Fall, Hoge missed the cut three times,\" Kannon said. \"In fact, dating back to the PGA Championship last May, Hoge has missed nine cuts over 15 starts on Tour. Hoge has played the Sony Open 10 times and despite a third-place finish in 2018, he has missed the cut four times. I am not banking on him returning to form just yet.\" See who Kannon is backing at SportsLine.Another golfer that Kannon is fading is Tony Finau, who is +1100. The 36-year-old turned pro in 2007 and has earned six wins on the PGA Tour, one on the Korn Ferry Tour as well as two others. He registered his last win at the Mexico Open in April 2023.\"It has been a tumultuous past year or so for Finau, battling legal issues and a golf game that saw him finish top-10 just one time in 2025,\" Kannon said. \"Approach play, Scrambling, Greens in Regulation, Putting – you name it, Finau has dropped to 125th to 150th territory in the Tour rankings across the board statistically. I imagine it will turn around for a player of his caliber, but I am not going to count on it happening just yet. In five prior visits to Waialae, Finau has missed the cut twice and never finished better than 20th.

    "body": "\n        All bets appear to be off as Mike Tomlin has become the latest former NFL coach to leave his post. While many of his peers were fired since the 2025 regular season concluded, Tomlin was one of the fortunate few NFL coaches who was able to leave on his terms. That's what happened on Tuesday, mere hours after the Steelers' 2025 season came to an end after Pittsburgh lost its seventh straight playoff game under Tomlin. Tomlin and the Steelers' lack of recent playoff success somewhat overshadowed his overall body of work in Pittsburgh that included a Super Bowl win, two AFC titles, eight division titles, 13 playoff appearances and 19 straight non-losing seasons. Still just 53 years old, Tomlin will surely have his share of options regarding what he will do next. And while some potential options are more realistic than others, the recent turnover in the NFL should be a reminder to not rule anything out when it comes to Tomlin and what he might do next. \n        \n            \n                Mike Tomlin stepping away could give the Steelers the reset they need. It'll be easier said than done\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHere's a quick rundown of Tomlin's likely options as he charts out on a new path. \nCoaching in 2026 While many assumed that Pittsburgh would be his last team, Tomlin recently acknowledged on the Rich Eisen Show that he still loves coaching despite the obvious challenges that come with it. \"Hey, I'm institutionalized,\" he said. \"Man, I gotta have it. I just love the challenges week in and week out that this job provides. The growth in it, the collective growth, the individual growth. A lot of lessons that I've learned in life have been through my football experiences. I've been on the team every year of my life since 1980, and so I really appreciate it.\" In that vein, it shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone if Tomlin is back on the sidelines in 2026. And if he chooses to coach again, he will likely have his pick of several jobs that are currently open. Having the opportunity to interview for one of the league's current openings may have been one of the reasons why he chose to step down less than 24 hours after the Steelers' season ended. \nOne thing we know is that Tomlin doesn't want to spend time on a rebuild. There's a reason why the Steelers never had a losing season under his watch. He wants the opportunity to win now and every year moving forward. That means that Tomlin's next potential team would have to have a roster that is in position to win now. That could lead to the Atlanta Falcons, who are coming off two disappointing 8-9 seasons despite having several stars on their roster that includes running back Bijan Robinson, wideout Drake London, tight end Kyle Pitts, safety Jessie Bates III, and pass rushers James Pearce Jr. and Jalon Walker, among others. Quarterback remains a question in Atlanta, although the Falcons don't have a bad situation after Kirk Cousins showed major signs of his old form last year after replacing Michael Penix Jr. in the starting lineup. \nOutside of Atlanta, the Ravens would be another appealing landing spot. In Baltimore, Tomlin would have his coveted franchise quarterback in Lamar Jackson and a team that was a play away from defeating the Bills and reaching the AFC title game in 2024. While less appealing, the Browns could also be a possible landing spot for Tomlin. Unlike Atlanta and Baltimore, Tomlin would likely get a statue in Cleveland if he led the Browns to their first division title since 1989. While his consistent streak of non-losing season probably wasn't properly appreciated in Pittsburgh, it undoubtedly would in Cleveland. The Browns are coming off consecutive losing seasons, but they fielded one of the NFL's defenses last season and have an intriguing quarterback room in Shedeur Sanders and Dillon Gabriel. Those things could be selling points for Tomlin, who also wouldn't have to move very far if he ended up in Cleveland. \nThere's a major roadblock, though, which would likely prevent Tomlin from ending up in either Baltimore or Cleveland. That's the fact that the Steelers still own his rights, which means that -- unless they release him from his contract a year early -- Pittsburgh would have to approve a trade that would involve Tomlin, which leads us to our next scenario. A jump to media Similar to coaching, there's a belief that Tomlin would have his pick of several media jobs should he chose to go that route. While it probably wouldn't be as gratifying as coaching, a job in the media would allow Tomlin to stay close to the game while working significantly less hours and giving him the chance to showcase his impressive communication skills. Tomlin-isms have become the stuff of legend in Pittsburgh. His weekly Tuesday press conferences typically included some of his patented sayings (my personal favorite was \"When you have red paint, you paint your barn red\") that were often as humurous as they were insightful. \nIt might help that Tomlin's mentor, Tony Dungy, has enjoyed an extremely successful career in broadcasting since he left coaching nearly 20 years ago. Tomlin's predecessor, Bill Cowher, has also enjoyed a highly-successful career in broadcasting that has actually lasted longer than his time as the Steelers coach. From a legacy standpoint, there's no doubt that Dungy and Cowher's relevancy as broadcasters helped both receive induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. It would likely do the same for Tomlin, whose career in Pittsburgh largely mimicked the success that Dungy and Cowher had as coaches. While he may never look back, Tomlin could decide to get back into coaching after the 2026 season, when he would no longer be under contract with the Steelers. That would allow him to sign with anyone without any strings attached. \nA year offIn my opinion, this is the most unlikely scenario. For someone whose boundless energy became the stuff of legend in Pittsburgh, it's far-fetched to imagine Tomlin stashing that energy away for a year in lieu of some down time. That being said, it is definitely possible that Tomlin takes a year to himself before making his next move. Coaching in the NFL is a grind, after all, and Tomlin might be ready for a well-deserved break. A year off would given Tomlin more time with his wife and three adult children. It would also give him some time to enjoy what he was able to accomplish in Pittsburgh before he delves into his next challenge. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Just nine days ago, Mike Tomlin pounded his chest and blew kisses to the camera after Baltimore Ravens kicker Tyler Loop's field goal drifted wide right and the Pittsburgh Steelers had somehow, some way won the AFC North.Tuesday, he kissed goodbye one of the most remarkable coaching tenures in NFL history, stepping down as Steelers coach after 19 seasons at the helm.He won a Super Bowl in his second year and made another in his fourth. He made the playoffs 13 times. He won the AFC North eight times. He never had a losing season.But the Super Bowl victory was back in 2008, and the \"no losing seasons\" line wore thin -- more easy to begrudgingly accept than to be proud of -- as the playoff failures mounted. Pittsburgh's 30-6 loss to the Houston Texans was emblematic of all that had gone wrong since the Steelers' last postseason win, back in early 2017. The latest veteran stopgap quarterback, Aaron Rodgers, was swallowed whole by Houston's defense. The Pittsburgh defense played admirably, but not to the dominant level of its opponent.\nThe team, simply, wasn't good enough. It hasn't been good enough for years. Since 2020, the Steelers have played in five wild card games. They have been outscored 179-95 in those five games, the second-worst margin across a five-game wild card span ever. Making the dance might have been nice for a few days until they were overwhelmed on the dance floor, their flaws exposed on the biggest stages.\n        \n            \n                Eight Steelers coaching candidates to watch after Mike Tomlin steps down\n                \n                    Bryan DeArdo                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nOver the last nine seasons, only six teams have more regular-season wins than the Steelers do, but 25 teams have more postseason wins. The Cleveland Browns -- the laughingstock of the NFL for most of the 21st century -- have a playoff win more recently than the Steelers do. Same for the forlorn New York Giants. The Jacksonville Jaguars and the Tennessee Titans have three playoff wins apiece since Pittsburgh's last.That the Steelers have made so many trips since then shows Tomlin's magic. That they haven't won any of those games shows his limitations. Since Pittsburgh's last playoff win, nine different players have started a game at quarterback. Eight managed to go .500 or better. That's what Tomlin did. He found ways to win. That's generally the best thing a coach can do.\nBut Tomlin also fell victim to the worst thing a coach can do: fail to change. After Ben Roethlisberger retired in 2022, the Steelers swung and missed on Kenny Pickett in the first round of the NFL Draft, and Tomlin immediately fell back into the comfort of veteran quarterbacks: Justin Fields and Russell Wilson in 2024, Rodgers in 2025. He knew he could survive with players of lesser caliber; could he take a marginal step up with marginally better ones?Over the past five years, Steelers quarterbacks rank 22nd in expected points added per play, nestled comfortably among the league's mediocre. Pittsburgh won on the margins -- the league's best turnover differential, one of the league's best penalty margins and red zone defenses -- and just kept on keeping on. Pittsburgh 21 wins when outgained were tied for most in the NFL over that span. For the past decade, one could comfortably pencil in the Steelers for 8-10 wins, watch them play four months of mediocre football, and see them produce ... 8-10 wins.It was comfortable until the truth became uncomfortable: that the status quo wasn't aligned with championship aspirations. The Steelers might have said they were playing for titles, but the roster (and especially the quarterback choices), over and over again, said otherwise\nNow things get really uncomfortable. Change, naturally, is uncomfortable, especially for a flagship franchise. Pittsburgh has had just three coaches in the last half-century plus: Chuck Noll from 1969-91, Bill Cowher from 1992-2006 and Tomlin from 2007-25. Cowher and Tomlin delivered playoff trips in their first season and Super Bowl trips not long thereafter.Tomlin's successor might not be able to do the same, and that might be a good thing in the long run.The Steelers were the NFL's oldest team. Their quarterback turned 42 during this season. Their three Pro Bowlers are 36 (Cameron Heyward), 31 (Jalen Ramsey) and 31 (T.J. Watt). Their misses in the NFL Draft at key positions -- quarterback and wide receiver in particular -- left them scrambling, and Tomlin could scramble with the very best of 'em. But the constant papering over got exposed come playoff time again and again.\nIn order to escape this cycle, the Steelers must be comfortable with the uncomfortable. Comfortable in *gasp* a step back or maybe even *gasp* their first losing record since 2003.There's a quote attributed to businessman N.R. Narayana Murthy that goes: \"Growth is painful. Change is painful. But, nothing is as painful as staying stuck where you do not belong.\"The last nine years weren't where the Steelers belong. Steelers fans shouldn't be tucking away their Terrible Towels for the offseason in early January, wondering which underwhelming quarterback might be able to get them back to the playoffs. This is a franchise built on championships. Or at least it was, before the past half-decade.\nIt might take some time, but an earnest attempt to build a title contender is preferable to a half-hearted attempt to build a playoff contender. The Steelers aren't completely barren in the \"young cornerstone pieces\" department, but the young core needs significant reinforcements and upgrades. The Steelers needs another pass-catching weapon opposite DK Metcalf. They need additions in the secondary around Joey Porter Jr. They need to continue to develop what youngsters they do have in the trenches.And most importantly, they need to get comfortable with being uncomfortable at quarterback, a la when Cowher selected Roethlisberger 11th overall in 2004. There was no guarantee it would work out -- a burly quarterback from Miami of Ohio making the jump to a win-now team. Tomlin infamously never developed a succession plan for life after Roethlisberger and, in turn, never fielded a championship-caliber team after Roethlisberger retired.It's a new world for one of the NFL's most stable organizations. Tomlin brought stability, toughness and discipline, all descriptors of the high-floor operation he ran.\nAnd don't take that for granted. When every other team in the NFL dipped into losing seasons, Tomlin kept churning out winners. He adapted. He overcame. He led. There's honor in that. But there's also honor in striving for greater, even if it takes a while to get there.And by \"a while,\" we mean it might take years. It might take multiple coaches and multiple quarterbacks. The New England Patriots swung and missed on a coach (Jerod Mayo) and a quarterback (Mac Jones) at the end of the Bill Belichick era before getting it right with Mike Vrabel and Drake Maye. The Kansas City Chiefs had to take a big and uncomfortable swing on Patrick Mahomes. Same for the Buffalo Bills and Josh Allen. Fittingly, the Steelers' biggest rival, the Ravens, are also departing from a good-but-not-good-enough status quo of John Harbaugh and jumping into the unknown the same year Tomlin is leaving the Steelers. The Steelers are far from adding a seventh Lombardi Trophy. They're far from finding a definitive answer at the game's most important decision. They don't have a second-round pick this season, and for the first time in nearly two decades, they don't even have a coach. Hiring a coach as good as Tomlin will be no easy task. The Steelers might get it wrong. In fact, there's a good chance they will get it wrong.\nBut they also have a chance to get it right, as they did with their past three coaching hires. A chance to blaze a different path, one that may have more twists and turns and stops and starts than any Tomlin season did. A chance to finally get unstuck.\n            ",

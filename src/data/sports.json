    "body": "\n        Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza will try to become the fourth Heisman winner win a national championship in College Football Playoff history -- and just the third to go unbeaten -- after Friday night's 56-22 victory over Oregon in the Peach Bowl semifinals.Top-ranked Indiana will face No 10 Miami on Jan. 19 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, a matchup of two emerging powers battling for college football's ultimate crown.\"With a strong culture, you can accomplish anything,\" Mendoza said on the broadcast after the game. \"We have a strong culture in the locker room, our coaching staff, our administration. We're a bunch of misfits. There are zero five-stars on our team. We're just guys, glued together, trying to reach a common goal -- to win every single game.\"Indiana's latest dismantling of an elite opponent was effectively decided by Mendoza's third touchdown pass of the first half, which opened a 28-point lead at intermission against Oregon. A week after nearly flawless work in the Hoosiers' quarterfinal blowout of Alabama, Mendoza finished 17 of 20 for 177 yards and five touchdowns against the Ducks.\nThrough two playoff wins, Mendoza has thrown more touchdown passes (eight) than incompletions (five). His five-touchdown dissection of Oregon's defense came one week after the Ducks shut out Big 12 champion Texas Tech. It ranks among the most dominant performances by a Heisman Trophy winner in playoff history, rivaling LSU quarterback Joe Burrow's seven-touchdown half against Oklahoma in 2019 and Alabama wide receiver DeVonta Smith's first-half explosion against Ohio State in 2020.Burrow and Smith are the only Heisman winners to lead their programs to perfect seasons in the CFP era. The odds-on favorite to be selected No. 1 overall in April's NFL Draft, Mendoza helped Indiana secure the first No. 1 ranking in program history following its Big Ten Championship win over Ohio State and now stands poised to lead college football's first 16-0 national champion in his final start.Indiana's 56 points against Oregon were the second-most in Peach Bowl history. Only Burrow and LSU scored more, posting 63 against Oklahoma.\nHeisman winners in CFP title gameFernando Mendoza, Indiana QB, 2025 Bryce Young, Alabama QB, 2021 (lost national championship)Devonta Smith, Alabama WR, 2020 (won national championship)Joe Burrow, LSU QB, 2019 (won national championship)Derrick Henry, Alabama RB, 2015 (won national championship)Marcus Mariota, Oregon QB, 2014  (lost national championship)The most notable addition in Indiana's 23-player transfer haul during the 2025 cycle, Mendoza spent two seasons at California before finding his star-potential landing spot with coach Curt Cignetti and the Hoosiers.An Indiana win over Miami -- which is seeking to become the first team to win a national title on its home field since the Hurricanes did it in 1991 -- would complete what could be considered one of the greatest coaching feats in the sport's history. Mendoza's rise has been central to Cignetti's success.\"I was very excited that we got him. When he went into the portal, it didn't take me long — in terms of plays,\" Cignetti said this week in an interview with CBS Sports' Jenny Dell. \"When we got him, he was a little behind in the pocket relative to where I thought he would be in terms of footwork, timing, rhythm and processing. That took a little bit of time. We also had a new quarterbacks coach.\n\"But the development he's made -- I can't say enough great things about him. He competes like a lion. He plays his best when the game is on the line. His legs have been invaluable. He can make all the throws, he's extremely intelligent and I've never seen a guy prepare like him. That's why he's put together the kind of year he's had.\"Up next for the Hoosiers is a matchup with a Hurricanes team that ranked No. 1 in the ACC in both total defense and scoring defense this season. The Hurricanes have been especially stingy in the CFP, holding Texas A&M to three points, limiting Ohio State to 14 and cooling off a red-hot Ole Miss offense in the Fiesta Bowl semifinals.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Miami Dolphins have hired Jon-Eric Sullivan as their next general manager, the team announced on Friday evening. Sullivan is a long-time Green Bay Packers executive who started with the team in 2003 and has worked as the vice president of player personnel since 2022.\"What an incredible honor it is to serve as general manager of the Miami Dolphins, an organization of history, tradition and great pride,\" said Sullivan in a statement. \"I want to express my gratitude to Stephen Ross and his family for this exceptional opportunity and the belief they've placed in me to lead this storied franchise forward. I also want to thank the entire Packers organization, especially Brian Gutekunst and the late Ted Thompson, for their leadership and allowing me to be entrenched in a process that has brought more than 30 years of sustained success to Green Bay.\"Now, as we forge ahead, we will build a football team that is resilient, physical and tough. We will compete no matter the circumstances, with the ultimate goal of competing for division championships and Super Bowls. Our team building process will be intentional, disciplined and sound. And we will do it together, with collaboration and hard work. It has always been and always will be a team sport. I can't wait to get started.\"\nSullivan was a scout with the Packers when they won Super Bowl XLV to cap off the 2010 season and has worked closely with Packers GM Brian Gutekunst to build a perennial playoff contender in Green Bay. Sullivan is the son of long-time college and NFL coach Jerry Sullivan, who spent 40 years on various sidelines and worked for the Dolphins as a wide receivers coach in 2004.In Miami, Sullivan replaces Chris Grier, who was fired by the Dolphins in October after serving as the team's GM since 2016, when he was promoted from director of college scouting. During Grier's tenure as general manager, the Dolphins experienced seven losing seasons and reached the postseason only three times. Miami has not won a playoff game since 2000.\n        \n            \n                Dolphins fire Mike McDaniel: Offensive guru out after second straight losing season, benching Tua Tagovailoa\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSullivan's first task in Miami will be hiring a new coach to replace Mike McDaniel, who was fired Thursday after the team's 7-10 finish to the 2025 season, his fourth as coach. The Dolphins started the year 2-7 but rallied by winning five of their final eight. Ultimately, it was not enough to save McDaniel's job as owner Stephen Ross said the team is in need of \"comprehensive change.\"\n\"I could not be more excited to welcome Jon-Eric Sullivan as our next general manager. Jon-Eric brings a clear vision for how to build and run a football team, founded upon his own experience at a winning organization,\" Dolphins wner Stephen Ross said in a statement. \"As we went through our search process, it became undeniable the respect Jon-Eric has across the league as a talent evaluator, leader and man of integrity.\"Miami's season included the benching of former No. 5 overall pick Tua Tagovailoa one year after the Dolphins signed him to a four-year, $212.4 million contract extension. Tagovailoa said Monday he would \"be good with\" a new opportunity elsewhere. After hiring a new coach, figuring out what to with Tagovailoa, who has a $56.4 million cap hit in 2026, will surely be one of Sullivan's top priorities. \n            ",

    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL playoffs are set, and teams like the Texans and Jaguars enter in on win streaks of nine and eight games, respectively, and could be highly sought after with NFL picks. Meanwhile, Green Bay is riding a four-game losing streak and is a 1.5-point favorite against the Bears on Saturday night, per the latest Wild Card Weekend NFL odds. Those two split their regular season matchups as they'll tangle in the postseason for just the third time ever. The NFL line for that game matches Bills vs. Jaguars (-1.5) as the slimmest of the Wild Card Weekend NFL spreads, while the largest has the Rams favored by 10.5 points over the Panthers as Los Angeles is getting receiver Davante Adams (hamstring) back.Other spreads include 49ers vs. Eagles (-6), Chargers vs. Patriots (-3.5) and Steelers vs. Texans (-3). The Jaguars opened as underdogs, but have flipped to slight favorites, joining the Eagles and Patriots as the home favorites of the opening round of the 2026 NFL playoffs. All of the updated Wild Card Weekend NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Wild Card Weekend NFL picks now.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

While Houston has an elite defense, it allowed its most points (30) all year in Week 18 to a Colts team with a fourth-string rookie quarterback, which is no comparison to an Aaron Rodgers-led unit getting back a rested DK Metcalf. As for C.J. Stroud, he is 0-2 on the road in his playoffs career, failing to account for a touchdown in either loss.

However, both teams' defenses actually rank even higher than their offenses in total scoring, with Indiana having the No. 2 scoring defense at 11.1 points per game allowed, and Oregon sixth at 15.3 ppg. Neither team allowed a touchdown in its quarterfinal games despite challenging matchups, with Indiana playing Alabama and Oregon going against Texas A&M. These two teams combined for 50 points in their regular-season matchup, but with this being the second time they meet, plus the increased attention to detail in preparing for a semifinal, the model projects a lower-scoring matchup tonight.

No. 10 Miami will face No. 1 Indiana on Jan. 19 at Hard Rock Stadium in South Florida for college football's ultimate prize. Despite entering the postseason as a double-digit seed, Miami will unofficially become the first team in the CFP era to \"host\" the national championship game.Indiana advanced to the title game after defeating Oregon in the Peach Bowl CFP semifinal. It will be the Hoosiers' first national title game appearance in program history. The Hoosiers had been one of the least successful FBS programs before coach Curt Cignetti arrived and guided the team to back-to-back CFP appearances.The national title game will mark just the third meeting between the programs. Miami and Indiana last played during the 1960s, with the Hoosiers earning a 28-14 win in 1964 before the Hurricanes evened the series with a 14-7 victory in 1966. Both games were played in Miami.\nIndiana entered the CFP without a postseason win since 1991, a drought that ended in dramatic fashion earlier this month with a 38-3 victory over Alabama in the CFP quarterfinals at the Rose Bowl. Miami is one win away from its first national title since 2001. After going 5-7 in Mario Cristobal's first season at his alma mater in 2022, the Hurricanes have surged to 13 wins and counting, reaching the national championship game for the first time since 2002. \nWith the expanded playoff format, Miami's 13 wins are the most in program history. The Hurricanes had previously reached 12 wins four times, including a 12-0 run during their 2001 national championship season.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        UFC paints on a fresh canvas in 2026. A seven-year deal between UFC and Paramount+ begins later this month, removing the pay-per-view model and reimagining matchmaking elements.There are differences between dream fights, fights the UFC can make, and the ones they'll book. A Ronda Rousey comeback would be front-page news, but it's unlikely to happen. Alex Pereira vs. Khamzat Chimaev is gangbusters, but the timing doesn't line up well for 2026 -- Chimaev hasn't defended the middleweight title yet, and Pereira wants to move up and challenge at heavyweight. Even Jon Jones' return is unlikely based on UFC CEO Dana White's statements. Fortunately, grounding expectations still leaves us with numerous blockbuster fights. With 2026 underway, let's explore the five biggest fights to make this year, rooted in reality.Get ready for the start of the Paramount+ era with our UFC Fan Guides: Brief history of the sport | Active fighters to know | Most exciting fights to watch ahead of UFC 324 | Important rules to know\nWelterweight title: Islam Makhachev vs. Ilia Topuria Can you name a bigger super fight you can make right now? I don't think it's possible. Makhachev and Topuria are the very best the promotion has to offer: reigning UFC champions, two-division champs and the active top two pound-for-pound fighters. Topuria and Makhachev are among the sport's most popular fighters and have an existing rivalry to build on. Very rarely do the stars align so strongly. The UFC has hurdles to overcome before booking this fight. Topuria will miss the first quarter of 2025, at minimum, while battling an alleged extortion plot. The UFC needs championship main events, meaning Makhachev will likely defend his title before then. The four welterweight contenders that come to mind are Kamaru Usman, Ian Machado Garry, Shavkat Rakhmonov and Michael Morales. Whatever direction the UFC goes, a successful title defense gives Makhachev enough time to fight Topuria in the back half of 2026. Topuria's timeline might be even tighter with a rightful challenger awaiting him.\nLightweight title: Ilia Topuria vs. Paddy PimblettUFC 324 will be headlined by an interim lightweight title fight in Topuria's absence. The winner, either Justin Gaethje or Pimblett, should be in line for a title unifier. With complete respect to Gaethje, arguably the most exciting fighter in UFC history, Topuria vs. Pimblett is the bigger box office fight. Topuria and Pimblett's heated rivalry dates back years. In 2022, Topuria and Pimblett had a heated altercation in a London hotel. \nPimblett was a lightweight prospect whose commercial appeal far outweighed his critical success. Topuria was an unheralded featherweight. A fight between them made little sense. Topuria eclipsed Pimblett in a few short years, becoming a two-division champion and graduating to Pimblett's weight class. \"The Baddy\" took more time to mature into an elite fighter, but is now on the cusp of holding an interim title. UFC 324 has shades of Conor McGregor vs. Chad Mendes -- the loudmouth European fighting the heavy-handed American, with a shot at a decorated international champion in the balance. Pimblett parading around with the interim title while mocking Topuria makes for excellent television. A press conference tour would kick it into overdrive. Pimblett needs to overcome Gaethje for any of this to come to fruition, but it'll be a big deal if it does.Women's bantamweight title: Amanda Nunes or Kayla Harrison vs. Valentina Shevchenko  Nunes and Harrison are keeping the women's bantamweight division afloat. Raquel Pennington and Julianna Pena failed to generate interest as UFC champions. In hindsight, they were detours between Nunes' retirement and Harrison's reign. The division gets back on track at UFC 324. \nHarrison vs. Nunes serves as the co-main event. It immediately stands among the most pivotal women's fights of all time. Nunes is the greatest women's MMA fighter ever: a former two-division champion who beat Rousey, Cris Cyborg, Valentina Shevchenko (twice) and many more. Harrison is among the most decorated women's combat athletes: a two-time gold medalist judoka, two-time PFL tournament winner, and reigning UFC champion. The promotion should get creative if they want to keep the momentum rolling coming out of UFC 324.UFC women's flyweight champion Shevchenko is coming off arguably her career-defining win, preventing former UFC women's champ Zhang Weili from joining the exclusive champ-champ club. \"Bullet\" doesn't have much left to prove at 125 pounds. She's the division's best fighter by a mile and long ago solidified her spot on the women's MMA Mount Rushmore. Natalia Silva and Erin Blanchfield are suitable contenders, but they can wait. Shevchenko has expressed interest in fighting Harrison, an idea floated by the women's bantamweight champ. She also wants to avenge her two losses to Nunes. Their second fight, a split decision, is heavily disputed as fans continue debating who should have left Canada as women's bantamweight champion.\nConor McGregor vs. Anyone A decade ago, the UFC sold for more than $4 billion. McGregor was pivotal to the sport's popularity boom at the time. He and Rousey were the biggest stars MMA has ever seen. Now, his reputation couldn't be much lower. Consecutive losses to Dustin Poirier hurt his competitive standing, and pulling out of his 2024 return against Michael Chandler with a broken pinky toe killed his goodwill with fans. He was also suspended for 18 months for a UFC anti-doping violation.Despite all of that, McGregor probably outdraws every current fighter on the UFC roster. His name, for better or worse, transcends MMA. It doesn't matter who he fights at this point. Chandler is still the most suitable opponent, especially in his current state. He also deserves it after McGregor stalled his career. UFC could also re-sign Nate Diaz for a long-overdue trilogy that should tap into a big market.McGregor has feverishly campaigned to fight at the White House card. He'll be eligible to compete by then. Unlike Jones, UFC CEO Dana White has expressed interest in bringing McGregor back for the event.\nBantamweight title: Petr Yan vs. Sean O'MalleyA new champion brings new possibilities. Dvalishvili nearly cleaned out the bantamweight division before Yan spoiled his plans to be the first UFC champion to make four title defenses in one year. CBS Sports' 2025 Fighter of the Year has numerous exciting options in his future. A trilogy fight with Dvalishvili and a first-time encounter with Umar Nurmagomedov sound terrific, but something about the Sean O'Malley rematch stands out. The two men previously fought in 2022. It was considered a mismatch at the time. Yan was the former champion and top contender against the rising star O'Malley who seemed to have more bark than bite.The fight overdelivered. It was a competitive three-round battle that earned Fight of the Night honors. O'Malley gave a great account of himself, though most believe Yan edged him out -- 96% of media scores gathered by MMA Decisions saw it for Yan. The judges disagreed. O'Malley was awarded a controversial split decision that expedited his trajectory to becoming UFC champion. Yan demolished Dvalishvili in their rematch, so why not continue the revenge tour against O'Malley? O'Malley fights Song Yadong on the UFC 324 main card; meanwhile, Nurmagomedov fights Deiveson Figueiredo on the undercard. A victory puts either man in a prime position to challenge Yan, but O'Malley's elevated position on the card suggests the promotion sees him as the more valuable player.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The first main event of the Zuffa Boxing era is set. On Friday, UFC CEO Dana White announced that the Jan. 23 event from the UFC Apex in Las Vegas would be headlined by a junior middleweight bout between Callum Walsh and Carlos Ocampo. The card will stream live on Paramount+ and take place the night before UFC 324 at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.Walsh (15-0, 11 KO) has been heavily hyped by White for years, with several of Walsh's fights streamed on UFC Fight Pass. With TKO's expansion into the boxing world with the new promotion, Zuffa Boxing, Walsh seemed like a sure thing to have been an anchor for the new promotional body, and his headline spot confirms those suspicions.In September, Walsh spoke to MMA Fighting and claimed the controversial expansion of TKO into boxing was a good thing and that he could never repay what White has done for his career.\"I like Dana,\" Walsh said. \"Me and Dana have a great relationship. Dana has done so much for my career. He's done so much for my life in general. I have no way of even repaying him, only by fighting and winning. The things that Dana has done for me, I'll forever be loyal to Dana, no matter what. I'll always defend Dana. I'll always do my best to talk well about him. Because he is a genuine good guy. He does care about the fighters. He does a lot behind the scenes that people don't see.\"Thus far, Walsh has lived up to the hype, impressively dispatching of a string of lower and mid-tier fighters. He currently sits as the No. 4-ranked junior middleweight by the IBF, as well as No. 5 and No. 13 by the WBC and WBO, respectively.\nIn his most recent outing, Walsh took a unanimous decision over Fernando Vargas Jr. on the undercard of Terence Crawford's win over Saul \"Canelo\" Alvarez.In Ocampo (38-3, 26 KO), Walsh faces a man with far more high-level experience, though Ocampo has come up short in his biggest fights.Ocampo's three losses have come against Errol Spence Jr. for the IBF welterweight title in 2018, Sebastian Fundora for the WBC interim junior middleweight title in 2022, and Tim Tszyu for the interim WBO title in 2023. Both Spence and Tszyu stopped Ocampo in the first round.\nSince the loss to Tszyu, Ocampo has rattled off a trio of stoppage wins against club-level fighters.\n            ",

Since ending his playing career in 2023, Blough, 30, has quickly risen up the coaching ladder, and he will now be tasked with getting Jayden Daniels and the Washington offense back on track.After going undrafted out of Purdue in 2019, Blough spent a few seasons as a backup quarterback with the Detroit Lions before playing his final full season with the Arizona Cardinals in 2022. Blough signed to the Lions' practice squad in 2023 but did not play in any games.In 2024, Commanders coach Dan Quinn hired Blough to be the assistant quarterbacks coach. Blough remained in that role for much of the last two seasons, until quarterbacks coach Tavita Pritchard was hired to be the next coach at Stanford in November. After that, Blough was promoted to quarterbacks coach for the remainder of the season.The Commanders' 2025 season was derailed by injuries to star players like Daniels and receiver Terry McLaurin, and the offense took a clear step back after reaching the NFC Championship Game the year prior. Washington ranked 22nd in points per game (20.9), 22nd in yards per game (318.8) and 24th in passing yards per game (184.1). In the wake of that disappointment, Quinn fired offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury.\nWith Washington in need of a replacement for Kingsbury, the team simply promoted Blough, who had received interest from other teams around the league. Dating back to his time with the Atlanta Falcons, Quinn has a history with letting talented assistants like Matt LaFleur and Mike McDaniel go to other teams. This time, he keeps Blough, who seems to be a rising star in the coaching world.\n            \n    ",

Davis underwent testing that reportedly revealed ligament damage. Davis and the Mavericks will consult a second opinion to determine the best course of action. If surgery is required the oft-injured big man could miss extended time. Davis has appeared in 20 games this season for the Mavericks, averaging 20.4 points and 11.1 rebounds per game, but injuries have kept him from consistently being on the floor -- as has been the case for much of his career. Davis missed 15 games early this season with a calf injury, then suffered a groin injury in Dallas' Christmas Day game that cost him two more games. \n\n        \n            \n                The Hawks have a good thing going... as long as they don't screw it up by trading for Anthony Davis\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe injury impacts not only the Mavericks, but some other teams that were considering Davis as a target ahead of the Feb. 5 trade deadline. The Atlanta Hawks were reportedly one of the top potential suitors for Davis, having cleared some space after trading Trae Young to the Washington Wizards. However, this latest injury for Davis would drastically impact his trade market if he is sidelined for a significant period of time\nDallas, Atlanta and other potential suitors will await word on whether Davis will require surgery and what kind of timeline for a return to the court he's facing. In the meantime, the 14-24 Mavericks will prepare for another stretch of the season without their star center. \n            \n    ",

No. 1 Indiana will face No. 10 Miami on Jan. 19 at Hard Rock Stadium in South Florida for college football's biggest prize. Miami is seeking its first national title since 2001, while Indiana is chasing the first championship in program history.Indiana, fresh off its first bowl win since 1991 after defeating Alabama in the CFP quarterfinals at the Rose Bowl, made another statement Friday. The Hoosiers defeated No. 5 Oregon 56-22 behind a dominant effort on both sides of the ball. In Year 2 of the Curt Cignetti era, Indiana now stands one win away from completing one of the most remarkable turnarounds in the sport's history.The matchup will mark the third all-time meeting between Indiana and Miami -- and the first since 1966. The Hoosiers earned a 28-14 victory in 1964 before the Hurricanes evened the series with a 14-7 win two years later.Miami earned its spot in the title game with a Fiesta Bowl semifinal that will be remembered as an instant classic. The Hurricanes controlled the line of scrimmage for much of the night, but Ole Miss appeared poised to steal the game after quarterback Trinidad Chambliss engineered a late touchdown drive to take a 27-24 lead with just over three minutes remaining.That proved to be too much time for Miami quarterback Carson Beck. The sixth-year senior answered with a poised, downfield march, capping the drive with a 3-yard touchdown run with 18 seconds left -- a play destined to live in Miami lore.Ole Miss still had one final chance, driving to the Hurricanes' 31-yard line for a last-gasp heave into the end zone. Chambliss' pass fell incomplete -- not without controversy -- sending Miami into celebration and back to the national championship game for the first time since 2002.Below, you'll find all the viewing information for every game all the way through to the CFP National Championship. \n                                                                    CBS Sports graphic\n                                                            2025-26 College Football Playoff bracketAll times Eastern\nFirst roundFriday, Dec. 19(9) Alabama 34, (8) Oklahoma 24 | RecapGaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium -- Norman, Oklahoma Saturday, Dec. 20(10) Miami 10, (7) Texas A&M 3 | RecapKyle Field -- College Station, Texas(6) Ole Miss 41, (11) Tulane 10 | RecapVaught-Hemingway Stadium -- Oxford, Mississippi (5) Oregon 51, (12) James Madison 34 | RecapAutzen Stadium -- Eugene, Oregon QuarterfinalsWednesday, Dec. 31Cotton Bowl -- (10) Miami 24, (2) Ohio State 14 | RecapAT&T Stadium -- Arlington, TexasThursday, Jan. 1Orange Bowl -- (5) Oregon 23, (4) Texas Tech 0 | RecapHard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Fla. Rose Bowl -- (1) Indiana 38, (9) Alabama 3 | RecapRose Bowl -- Pasadena, Calif.Sugar Bowl -- (6) Ole Miss 39, (3) Georgia 34 | RecapCaesars Superdome -- New OrleansSemifinalsThursday, Jan. 8Fiesta Bowl: (10) Miami 31, (6) Ole Miss 27 | RecapState Farm Stadium -- Glendale, Ariz. Friday, Jan. 9\nPeach Bowl: (1) Indiana 56, (5) Oregon 22 | RecapMercedes-Benz Stadium -- AtlantaCollege Football Playoff National ChampionshipMonday, Jan. 207:30 p.m. | ESPNHard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Fla. \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Nothing in the transfer portal is final until the ink is dry -- and sometimes not even then. DJ Lagway's verbal commitment to Baylor looked like a clean win for the Bears on Thursday, but the situation is still worth watching.Lagway, the former Florida quarterback, has continued dialogue with other programs, including Ole Miss, even after verbally committing to Baylor, sources told CBS Sports' Chris Hummer and Matt Zenitz on Friday afternoon. Lagway informed multiple people of his commitment to the Bears and even began recruiting other players on Baylor's behalf. Still, the continued communication elsewhere adds an unexpected wrinkle to what appeared to be a significant pickup for a Baylor team desperate for momentum.Lagway, the No. 1 quarterback in the 2024 high school recruiting class, committed to Baylor after two seasons at Florida. If he does inevitably enroll, he would be the highest-rated quarterback recruit ever to land in Waco. A Baylor legacy whose father Derek played for the Bears from 1997-2001, Lagway completed 62% of his passes at Florida for 4,179 yards, 28 touchdowns and 23 interceptions across 24 games, while also adding 237 rushing yards and a score.\nHe is currently ranked as the No. 4 quarterback and No. 13 overall prospect in Cooper Petagna's 247Sports transfer portal rankings.The appeal of Baylor is obvious. \n        \n            \n                Sam Leavitt to visit Miami: Arizona State QB, No. 1 in transfer portal, among options to replace Carson Beck\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nOffensive coordinator Jake Spavital has a strong reputation for developing quarterbacks, and the Bears' wide-open system mirrors what Lagway thrived in at Willis High School, where he set a Texas 6A record with 58 touchdown passes in 2023. For a player who battled injuries and inconsistency during Florida's 2025 season, Baylor offers a chance to reset away from the SEC spotlight.So why Ole Miss?Part of the answer may have emerged earlier Friday, when the NCAA formally denied quarterback Trinidad Chambliss' waiver request, effectively ending his college eligibility. Chambliss had transferred in from Division II Ferris State and was expected to return for the Rebels in 2026 if his waiver was approved. With that door now shut -- pending a potential appeal -- Ole Miss suddenly finds itself with fewer experienced options at quarterback on the heels of a run to the College Football Playoff semifinals.\nThat timing makes Lagway's continued dialogue with the Rebels more notable, even if nothing has changed publicly. Ole Miss is entering a new era under first-year coach Pete Golding, and quarterback clarity is now a pressing issue.For Baylor, the situation exposes just how precarious portal wins can be. After a 5-7 season, Bears coach Dave Aranda heads into 2026 squarely on the Big 12's hottest seat, and Lagway's pledge was seen as a rare jolt of energy for a program that has watched talent walk out the door during this portal window. Until Lagway is officially on campus and taking snaps in green and gold, nothing can be taken for granted. In the modern portal era, a commitment is no longer a finish line -- it's just another checkpoint.\n            ",

Miami has embraced its role as the Cardiac Canes this postseason, winning three games in three distinct ways — a late road touchdown to edge Texas A&M in a 10-3 defensive struggle, a physical 24-14 upset of No. 2 Ohio State in the quarterfinals and a dramatic, last-minute comeback to beat No. 6 Ole Miss 31-27 in the semifinals.Awaiting the Hurricanes is an Indiana team that has been historically dominant. The Hoosiers are the first team in CFP history to win two playoff games by 28-plus points -- and both victories came by more than 35. Indiana throttled No. 9 Alabama 38-3 in the Rose Bowl quarterfinals and dismantled No. 5 Oregon 56-22 in the Peach Bowl semifinals.All that stands between Indiana and a perfect 15-0 season -- and the first national championship in program history -- is a Miami team riding an improbable playoff run. The Hurricanes have already dethroned two top-three seeds and will be unusually comfortable playing the sport's biggest game inside their home stadium.Both teams arrive with electric defenses. Miami's dominant front and aggressive secondary have driven its postseason surge, while Indiana has controlled the line of scrimmage and smothered opposing offenses with relentless pursuit and execution.Offensively, both units face stiff tests but enter with confidence following strong semifinal performances. Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza has shredded Alabama and Oregon, aided by an Indiana offensive line that has provided time and a deep receiving corps capable of winning downfield. Miami's offense did just enough in its first two games before opening things up against Ole Miss, as Carson Beck caught fire and freshman standout Malachi Toney continued to show why he's one of the sport's rising stars.\nThe championship will ultimately come down to which team can solve the other's defensive puzzle. Either way, Jan. 19 will crown a fresh champion: Indiana is seeking its first national title, while Miami is chasing its first in 24 years.Below, you can stay updated with the College Football Playoff schedule as we move on to the national championship game. 2025-26 College Football Playoff scheduleAll times EasternCollege Football Playoff National ChampionshipMonday, Jan. 207:30 p.m. | ESPNHard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Fla. 2025-26 College Football Playoff scores, results\n                                                                    CBS Sports graphic\n                                                            First roundFriday, Dec. 19\n(9) Alabama 34, (8) Oklahoma 24 | RecapGaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium -- Norman, Oklahoma Saturday, Dec. 20(10) Miami 10, (7) Texas A&M 3: | RecapKyle Field -- College Station, Texas(6) Ole Miss 41, (11) Tulane 10 | RecapVaught-Hemingway Stadium -- Oxford, Mississippi (5) Oregon 51, (12) James Madison 34 | RecapAutzen Stadium -- Eugene, Oregon QuarterfinalsCotton Bowl -- (10) Miami 24, (2) Ohio State 14 | RecapAT&T Stadium -- Arlington, TexasOrange Bowl -- (5) Oregon 23, (4) Texas Tech 0 | RecapHard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Fla. Rose Bowl -- (1) Indiana 38, (9) Alabama 3 | RecapRose Bowl -- Pasadena, Calif.Sugar Bowl (6) Ole Miss 39, (3) Georgia 34 | RecapCaesars Superdome -- New OrleansSemifinals Fiesta Bowl: (10) Miami 31, (6) Ole Miss 27 | RecapState Farm Stadium -- Glendale, Ariz. Peach Bowl: (1) Indiana 56, (5) Oregon 22 | RecapMercedes-Benz Stadium -- Atlanta\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        The Memphis Grizzlies are reportedly seriously listening to trade offers for former All-Star guard Ja Morant for the first time ahead of the Feb. 5 NBA trade deadline. The challenge Memphis faces in trade discussions regarding Morant are similar to what Atlanta dealt with in dealing their own former All-Star guard Trae Young. The Hawks ultimately traded Young to Washington for CJ McCollum and Corey Kispert earlier this week, with neither side sending out any draft compensation in the deal. It was a paltry return for a player of Young's stature, but it was representative of the decrease in how the league values undersized, score-first point guards with defensive deficiencies on large contracts. That poses a problem for the Grizzlies in exploring trade opportunities for Morant. Memphis reportedly is prioritizing young players and/or draft compensation in a deal, but as we saw with the Young trade, there isn't a lot of interest in giving up valuable assets for a player of Morant's archetype right now. \nGiven we have a very recent example of a similar player (albeit with a differing skill set) getting traded, one can't help but wonder who has more trade value between Morant and Young. The Contract DifferenceLet's start with the biggest difference between the two that could work in Memphis' favor. That is the contract situation, where Morant has two more years and $87 million remaining on his deal after the 2025-26 season (with no options). Young, meanwhile, can hit free agency this summer if he chooses or pick up a $49 million player option for the 2026-27 season. Young will be looking to get paid again soon and had the ability to apply a bit of pressure to a team trading for him given his impending option decision. Any time a player will be seeking a new extension, that often works to the detriment of a player's overall trade value. Morant, meanwhile, will be under contract through the 2027-28 season. If a team still believes he can get back to the All-Star level he once showed, that could make him more attractive on the trade market. There are some teams that could view this as a buy low opportunity on an All-Star talent who may just be in need of a fresh start. For teams that don't typically have the opportunity to easily bring in star caliber players, that might be enough to take a swing and hope Morant can find his form again. \nAt 26 years old, Morant still can point to the potential to get his career back on track if he can get back healthy. When he was able to play consistently, the Grizzlies were consistently a competitive team that finished in the top half of the West. That's the pitch for Morant, the hope that if he can tap into the player he was four seasons ago, his Memphis teams always won at a high level. Morant vs. Young: Stats ComparisonUnfortunately, that's about the extent of the positives when it comes to comparing Morant to Young if you're the Grizzlies hoping to extract a better return from another team. Young and Morant are closely comparable statistically over the past four seasons (going back to 2022-23), but Young has played in nearly a full season of games more than the Grizzlies' star in that span. Stats since start of 2022-23 seasonTrae Young: 213 games played, 25.1 ppg, 10.8 apg 42.3/34.7/87.4 shooting splitsJa Morant: 138 games played, 24.1 ppg, 7.7 apg, 45.5/29.5/79.3 shooting splitsIf we were to take it to advanced stats, here's how they compare:Trae Young: 20.1 PER, 17.8 WS, .114 WS/48, 2.0 BPM, 7.6 VORPJa Morant: 20.7 PER, 10.6 WS, .118 WS/48, 3.3 BPM, 5.8 VORPIf you were to take away the 2022-23 season -- Morant's last All-Star campaign -- things tilt considerably toward Young in each of those advanced stat categories. \nMorant's availability has been a concern throughout his career -- he's never played in more than 67 games in a season, and that was as a rookie. Since the start of the 2023-24 season, he's appeared in just 77 games due to a combination of suspensions and injuries. When he has been on the court, Morant's productivity and efficiency have steadily declined. This season, as he's battled more injury issues, he has posted career lows in a number of areas -- much like Young had in Atlanta before being effectively salary dumped to Washington. Morant is averaging 19.0 points and 7.6 assists per game on 40.1/20.8/90.0 shooting splits in his 18 appearances this season. Just as we started to see glimpses of the old Morant, he went back on the injury report with a calf issue. \nAny team considering trading for Morant has to consider the possibility his best basketball is behind him. It's incredibly unfortunate that could be the case, because at his peak, Morant was one of the most entertaining and exciting players in the league. His explosiveness and fearlessness was astonishing to watch, but the latter part of that equation possibly contributed to his decline. Morant has dealt with numerous leg injuries in his career, and it has sapped some of that burst that made him such a terror to defend. Morant once lived at the rim, but his rim frequency has declined in every season of his career. This season, he's dipped to just 22.1% of field goal attempts coming within three feet of the rim -- as a rookie, that number was 39.6%. The 2025-26 season is also the first year of his career that more than 50% of his field goal attempts have come from beyond 10 feet from the basket. For a player whose main offensive weakness is his perimeter shooting, that's a concerning trend. \nSome of that could be attributed to roster changes in Memphis. The context of the team around him has changed, most notably with the departure of Desmond Bane, long the Grizzlies most-feared 3-point shooter. Perhaps another team could believe they could create more space for Morant to attack, but there's no doubt he's taken a step back in terms of his ability to threaten the rim as constantly as he did as a young phenom. Ultimately, it's hard to make a strong argument that Morant is a better player currently than Young, or that he even has more upside for the future. All of that produces a conundrum for Memphis as they begin listening to offers for Morant. It will be exceedingly difficult to get a high-quality young player or a first round pick back for Morant given what we saw with Young's market. \nThe Hawks prioritized getting out of Young's deal without having to give up any draft compensation and not take on any significant long-term money. If the Grizzlies decide to do the same, it's certainly possible they could find a similar deal. As the deadline approaches, we'll find out whether Memphis is truly just testing the waters or if they've reached a point where they want to simply get out of the Morant business. If the latter is true, I'd expect Morant to end up being traded in a similar deal to Young's, where a large veteran contract (or two) comes back to Memphis along with filler. If it's the former, Morant's time as a Grizzly will continue into the summer unless there's one team out there that has more belief in Morant's ability to return to a level we haven't seen in three years than most everyone else. \n            ",

Referee Dan Miragliotta leaped in to stop the fight at 4:56 of Round 1 as Costa likely secured a top-15 ranking at 145 pounds. \"I told everybody this week, I just fought a legend,\" Costa said. \"No one has been able to finish him and I said that I was going to do that. I was able to do it.\"After Ige scored an early takedown, Costa quickly scrambled back to his feet and began to wear Ige down in the clinch with knees to the body. From there, Costa showcased his full offensive bag by stunning Ige with a front kick to the face and going to the body with a variety of strikes that led up to the finish.\nCosta extended his win streak that began following a second-round knockout loss to Steve Garcia in 2023. Of his six wins on his current run, four have come by stoppage. After the fight, Costa called out a former two-time featherweight title challenger who was sitting Octagonside. \"There is a guy here that you all love and I love, too,\" Costa said. \"Diego Lopes, let's go at it.\"\nIge, a 34-year-old native of Hawaii, suffered his fifth loss in his last seven fights. \n            \n",

    "body": "\n        Never one to need help from the judges, hard-hitting welterweight Uros Medic recorded the biggest knockout of his career on Saturday in the co-main event UFC Fight Night in Houston.Medic (13-3), who has yet to have a fight go to the scorecards as a professional, landed a grazing left hook to the temple of veteran Geoff Neal and knocked him out cold at 1:19 of Round 1. The victory was his third straight, all by knockout, as the 32-year-old native of Serbia brought the Toyota Center crowd to its feet. \"Houston, we have a problem and it's me! I am the problem,\" Medic said. \"This division is in trouble. They need some of this, they need it, and I'm here to deliver. I'm going to knock everybody out and bulldoze through this division.\"Neal (16-8), a 35-year-old native of Texas, countered an early body kick to land a short left cross. Medic answered with some slick boxing of his own before the two heavy punchers landed right hands simultaneously in the center of the Octagon.\nMedic began to quickly open up and walk Neal down. He missed a pair of short hooks while switching stances before connecting on a perfect left hand to end the fight as Neal's head hit hard on the canvas forcing referee Kerry Hatley to instantly waive off the fight. \n\"I knock everybody out, everyone,\" Medic said. \"Sure, I lose sometimes but I'm just a human being. I may lose again but you bet your ass I'm going to come back and f---ing knock people out again.\"I knew [Neal] was going to want to box with me. Not a lot of guys want to box with me. I am an MMA fighter but boxing is something I love to do. I'm sorry this had to happen in front of his home crowd but this is the sport we are in. It's hard to watch. I have been on the wrong end of that but you get up and you keep f---ing going because life can hit 100 times harder than any man can.\"Neal lost for the fourth time in five fights and suffered his second straight knockout defeat. After the fight, Medic called out former welterweight champion Leon Edwards.\n\"Let's get this work in,\" Medic said. \"I'll be knocking everyone out.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Anthony Hernandez will look for the biggest win of his career on Saturday when he faces Sean Strickland in a middleweight clash in the main event of UFC Fight Night from Toyota Center in Houston.Strickland is a former UFC middleweight champion, having scored a shock win over Israel Adesanya at UFC 293. He would go on to drop the title in his next fight, a split decision loss to Dricus du Plessis at UFC 297. Strickland rebounded with a split decision win over Paulo Costa before losing in a championship rematch with du Plessis.Sign up for Paramount+ and WATCH UFC Fight Night LIVE for no additional fee -- every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with your subscription. Plans start as low as $8.99/month or $89.99/year!Hernandez's UFC career got off to a rough start, going 1-2 in his first three fights in the Octagon. He has since rattled off eight wins in a row to climb to the No. 4 spot in the official UFC middleweight rankings, one spot behind Strickland.\nUFC Fight Night also features two perennial contenders looking to protect their places in the pecking order. Geoff Neal (No. 12) battles the tenacious Uros Medic, and Dan Ige (No. 14) tries to snap Melquizael Costa's five-fight win streak. Both veterans approach fight night renewed after overcoming personal health issues. For Neal, a five-year battle with substance abuse. For Ige, eye injuries before the Patricio Pitbull fight. Elsewhere on the undercard, ranked heavyweights are set to collide when Ante Delija and Serghei Spivac face off. Delija is looking to bounce back from a surprising knockout loss to rising contender Waldo Cortes Acosta in November. Prior to that, Delija scored two first-round knockouts in his first two UFC appearances. And an interesting UFC debut is set at welterweight when Josiah Harrell takes on Jacobe Smith. Harrell was scheduled to make his promotional debut at UFC 290 against Jack Della Maddalena, but during his fight week medical screening, doctors discovered he had Moyamoya, a rare brain disease that causes the arteries supplying blood to the brain to become narrowed or blocked. Now, nearly three years later, he gets his chance to make a first impression.Below is all the information you need to catch the action on Saturday night.

    "body": "\n        The gold medal matchup that everyone in North America hoped for has come to fruition. Team USA and Canada are set to settle their intense rivalry with a gold medal on the line.The two best teams in this Olympic field, the U.S. and Canada had to fight to get here. The Americans needed overtime to beat Sweden in the quarterfinals, and the Canadians required third-period comebacks to beat Czechia and Finland in the knockout rounds. With both squads now battle-tested, this gold medal game has all the ingredients for an all-time classic.\"I think this is a whole new experience,\" Team USA coach Mike Sullivan said when asked about the rematch from last year's 4 Nations Face Off. \"When you look at the two games that were played in the 4 Nations tournament, they were pretty evenly played games on both sides. We came out on the right side on one and the wrong side on the other. So what I can tell you is that the American team is the best team I've ever been around.\"The group of players has a certain personality to them that is contagious with their energy and their resilience and their care for one another and how hard they play for each other. I couldn't be more proud of them.\"\nOn paper, these are two evenly-matched teams, and the oddsmakers see it as a toss-up too. According to DraftKings, the Canadians are slight favorites at -125 with the Americans at +105 odds.\n        \n            \n                Team USA vs. Canada: Ranking the 10 best players in the gold medal game of the 2026 Winter Olympics\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBefore the puck drops on this highly anticipated clash of the hockey titans, we'll take a deeper look at the matchup and make our pick for the gold medal winner.Where to watch USA vs. CanadaDate: Sunday, Feb. 22 | Time: 8:10 a.m. ETLocation: Milano Santagiulia Arena -- Milan, ItalyTV: NBCOdds: Canada -125, USA +105\nUSA vs. Canada previewThe U.S. and Canada are two different teams with two very different strengths. The Canadians are built on an elite core of forwards with a lineup capable of scoring in bunches, and the Americans are built to prevent that very thing. Which philosophy will win out on Sunday?Thus far, the Canadians scored their way out of trouble, and Connor McDavid and Macklin Celebrini are lethal together on the first line. Canada also brings Nathan MacKinnon, the leading scorer in the NHL, as its second-line center. The real wild card here is the health of Sidney Crosby. He missed the semifinal game with a lower-body injury, and if he can go, Crosby gives Canada incredible depth as the third-line center. If Crosby misses the game, that matchup gets more favorable for the U.S. with Nick Suzuki slotting in there.Mitch Marner, Bo Horvat and Brandon Hagel bring playmaking and scoring on the wings. Marner was the hero in Canada's overtime win over Czechia, pulling off a show-stopping move to win the game.\nThe Americans have a nice one-two punch down the middle as well, even if they don't have the offensive ceilings of McDavid and MacKinnon. Jack Eichel and Auston Matthews are elite two-way players, and they've lived up to that billing in Milan. That duo has its work cut out for it in trying to contain their Canadian counterparts, but Eichel and Matthews are capable of doing it at their best. Larkin is a great third-line center for Team USA, and he's been heating up over the last two games.On the wings, the U.S. brings a balance of skill and sandpaper. Matthew and Brady Tkachuk embody that dynamic, blending physicality with finesse around the net. The most interesting winger for the Americans, however, is known more for his flash. Jack Hughes has made some brilliant plays at the Olympics, and he's playing at a superstar level, which is good for the U.S.\"It's been 46 years. So many players that have paved the way for us that haven't had a chance to win gold for us, that for our dream to be right there,\" Tkachuk said. \"It's something that we're not taking lightly. And I mean, we have an opportunity to achieve a childhood dream.\"\nDefense is where the balance of power shifts to the U.S. Led by Quinn Hughes and Zach Werenski, the Americans are loaded on the blue line. Those two are excellent puck-movers who can be trust to contribute in all three zones, but the U.S. has plenty of versatility behind them. Jaccob Slavin is one of the best shutdown defenders in the NHL, and Brock Faber fits well beside him in a similar role. Charlie McAvoy is great in his own end -- and he's not afraid to lay the lumber -- but he can also chip in on offense. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Jake Sanderson as an underrated star either.The Canadian defense has more questions. They have the best defenseman in the world in Cale Makar, but the team's decision not to take more players with offensive upside was exacerbated by Josh Morrissey's injury early in the tournament. Drew Doughty and Travis Sanheim are fine in their own end, but they can't be relied upon consistently in the offensive zone. The same could be said for Colton Parayko, who is there for more of a physical presence. Shea Theodore and Thomas Harley have some offensive chops, but the latter is having a poor season with the Dallas Stars.In goal, we have a real conundrum. Connor Hellebuyck is arguably the best goalie in the world, but he has been known to shrink in the Stanley Cup Playoffs. Jordan Binnington is statistically the worst goalie in the NHL this season, but all he does is turn into Martin Brodeur on hockey's biggest stages. The U.S. has the edge on paper, but history and experience tell us the goaltender position might be more of a wash.\nUSA vs. Canada predictionThe Americans have been tormented by the Canadians on the world stage for my entire lifetime. I've seen 2002 in Salt Lake City, 2010 in Vancouver, 2014 in Sochi and last year in the 4 Nations Face-Off. The U.S. hasn't been able to slay this Red-and-White dragon in a game that really matters.However, this is the best American team that's ever been assembled, and it's right there with the Canadians as the most talented squad in the world. Canada still holds an edge, but as Czechia and Finland have proved, it's by no means immortal. Beyond that, Team USA was built with the idea in mind that it would have to slow down this Canada team. Were some of the roster decisions made in service of that mission highly questionable? Yes, but the Americans have a real identity.If I were making this prediction five days ago, I may have gone a different direction. The Canadians looked unstoppable in the preliminary round, and the Americans didn't always look like juggernauts. That said, the U.S.has developed chemistry over the course of this tournament, and it's improved with each passing game. Meanwhile, Canada has struggled with inferior opponents in its last two matchups.\nPerhaps it's recency bias, but one team has looked better than the other over the last couple of games. The Americans seem to be hitting their stride just in time for this showdown with Canada, and I think they find a way to harass the Canadian defense and get to Jordan Binnington.

    "body": "\n        Rondale Moore, 25, died on Saturday of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, said New Albany Police Chief Todd Bailey, who told multiple local media outlets that Moore's body was found in a garage. An autopsy is scheduled for Sunday, per WLKY-TV. Moore was born and grew up in New Albany, Indiana.The former star wide receiver at Purdue signed with the Minnesota Vikings in 2025 but suffered a season-ending knee injury during the year's first preseason game. Moore spent his first three seasons with the Arizona Cardinals, which selected him with the No. 49 overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft, before moving to the Atlanta Falcons, where he also suffered a preseason knee injury that prevented him from playing in 2024.\"We are deeply saddened by the passing of Rondale Moore,\" the Vikings said in a statement. \"While we are working to understand the facts, we have spoken with Rondale's family to offer our condolences and the full support of the Minnesota Vikings. We have also been in communication with our players, coaches, and staff, and will make counseling and emotional support resources available to anyone in need. Our thoughts are with Rondale's family and friends during this devastating time.\"The most dynamic player in college football during his freshman campaign with the Boilermakers, Moore was a consensus All-American, Paul Warfield Trophy winner and the CBS Sports Freshman of the Year in 2018, a season in which he amassed 1,258 yards receiving, 213 yards rushing and 14 total touchdowns. He only played seven games over his sophomore and junior seasons.\n\"Rondale Moore was a complete joy to coach,\" said Jeff Brohm, who led the Purdue football program while Moore was enrolled, in a statement. \"The ultimate competitor that wouldn't back down from any challenge. Rondale had a work ethic unmatched by anyone. A great teammate that would come through in any situation. We all loved Rondale, we loved his smile and competitive edge that always wanted to please everyone he came in contact with.\"Moore's best NFL effort was his third year with the Cardinals, his lone full professional season, when he gained 530 yards of total offense and scored two touchdowns. Moore gained 1,450 total yards and four touchdowns in Arizona.\n\"I am devastated by the news of Rondale's death,\" said Vikings coach Kevin O'Connell. \"While Rondale had been a member of the Vikings for a short time, he was someone we came to know well and care about deeply. He was a humble, soft-spoken, and respectful young man who was proud of his Indiana roots. As a player, he was disciplined, dedicated and resilient despite facing adversity multiple times as injuries sidelined him throughout his career. We are all heartbroken by the fact he won't continue to live out his NFL dream and we won't all have a chance to watch him flourish. My prayers are with Rondale's family, friends, teammates and coaches as we all deal with this tragic news.\"\n            ",

The Herons began the season away from home at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, where new LAFC coach Marc Dos Santos was able to kick things off with a statement victory against the reigning MLS champs. David Martinez had the winning goal for the Black and Gold, but it's a match that could've had a much larger gap between the sides if LAFC brought their finishing boots, which is saying something considering that it was a three-goal margin of victory. Martinez, Nathan Ordaz, and Denis Bouanga found the back of the net for the Black and Gold as 75,673 got to cheer their team on in Los Angeles. It's the second largest attendance in MLS history and the largest ever on the opening weekend of a season.Playing their first match without Sergio Busquets following his retirement, the lack of a midfield leader showed. On LAFC's second goal by Bouanga, no one tracked back and got the defense organized, which was a hallmark of the defensive midfielder, who is also known for his ability to quickly and accurately move the ball into dangerous positions to kickstart the attack.Rodrigo De Paul is expected to fill that void, but with so many changes to the roster --  three starters in the match weren't with the club last season -- there will be growing pains, which were seen in this match.\nMessi's quiet night saw him visibly frustrated with the teams lack of cohesion, as well as LAFC's ability to play physical. While Inter Miami remain one of the favorites to win MLS Cup 2026, LAFC may have just proven, at least early on, that they could be the team to beat.\n            \n",

    "body": "\n        Michigan began Saturday at the top of the college basketball hierarchy, enshrined during the March Madness bracket preview as the No. 1 overall seed. By the end of the day, the picture looked a little different, as No. 3 Duke's thrilling 68-63 win over the No. 1 Wolverines muddied up the race for the top spot in the NCAA Tournament bracket yet again.No. 4 Arizona threw its name into the hat with a 73-66 win at No. 2 Houston while playing without star forward Koa Peat. The takeaway from those two top-five battles is that there are now three 25-2 teams from three different conferences with impeccable credentials heading into the final week of February.In case you weren't already convinced, it should be obvious by now that we are in the midst of an elite regular season and headed toward an equally great postseason.Consequential results on Saturday weren't confined to the nation's most high-profile teams. No. 19 Vanderbilt landed as a No. 4 seed in the NCAA's bracket preview and promptly suffered a home loss to Tennessee. No. 8 Kansas, which was a No. 3 seed, took a historic home loss to a mediocre Cincinnati team.\nDown toward the bubble, results were arguably even more consequential.\n        \n            \n                Bracketology: 2026 NCAA Tournament committee faces challenges with Michigan, Houston, Florida in same region\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHere is the full rundown of winners and losers from a massive day of college basketball action.Winner: UCLA defeats Illinois with OT buzzer-beater UCLA worked ridiculously hard to storm back from a 23-point hole, and Donovan Dent made sure those efforts were not in vain. The jet-quick guard zoomed coast-to-coast for the game-winning layup as time expired to help UCLA beat No. 10 Illinois 95-94. Dent finished with 14 points and a whopping 15 dimes. The oft-invisible duo of Eric Dailey Jr. and Xavier Booker rose to the occasion with 36 enormous points.It's the third time that Illinois has lost in overtime during Big Ten play. — Isaac Trotter\nWinner: Duke takes down No. 1 MichiganMichigan's guards finished a combined 6 of 25 from the floor as No. 1 Michigan lost to No. 3 Duke 68-63 as the Wolverines suffered their second loss of the season. If there is an Achilles' heel for Michigan, it is the lack of an assassin in the backcourt. What was even more surprising, however, is that the towering Wolverines failed to match Duke down low. The Blue Devils were outscored 18-11 in second-chance points amid a 13-8 deficit on the offensive glass. Consequently, Duke outscored Michigan 34-24 in the paint with Cam Boozer leading the charge. The star freshman finished with 18 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists while deftly playing the final 4:47 with four fouls. His versatility was on display as well with a clutch late 3-pointer that put the Blue Devils up 64-58  —  David Cobb\nWinner: Arizona takes control of Big 12No. 4 Arizona scored its most significant win of the season, taking down No. 2 Houston on the road 73-66. The two teams entered the day tied atop the Big 12, but the Wildcats, who played without star freshman Koa Peat, wrested control of the conference's regular-season race in emphatic fashion. They led for nearly 37 minutes of game action and closed out the signature win by retaining the lead for the final 11 minutes.\nWith Peat injured, Arizona forward Ivan Kharchenkov played a season-high 39 minutes and added 16 points, nine rebounds and three assists. Wildcats guard Anthony Dell'Orso also chipped in in a big way, tying a season-high in scoring with 22 points.The Wildcats hold a one-game lead now on Houston in the Big 12 standings with just four regular-season games remaining. They will likely be favored in each of the four games, and their toughest tests – vs. No. 8 Kansas next Saturday and at home vs. No. 6 Iowa State the following Monday – are both home games. — Kyle Boone\t\nLoser: Kansas takes largest home loss under Bill SelfNo. 8 Kansas suffered its largest home loss under Bill Self, who began coaching the Jayhawks in 2003 – and its first double-digit home loss vs. an unranked opponent since 1993 – in a stunning 84-68 defeat to Cincinnati on Saturday. The Jayhawks closed as 8.5-point favorites but played from behind for the final 17-plus minutes of the game as Cincy turned a close game into a blowout by out-scoring KU 48-34 in the second half. \nThe good news for Kansas was that oft-injured guard Darryn Peterson played 32 minutes, tied for the third-most he's played in a game this season. The bad news for Kansas is that his 17 points in that action were rendered moot because of an abysmal defensive showing. KU allowed 12 made 3-pointers from Cincinnati, tied for the most it has allowed in a regulation game this season, and also surrendered 84 points, tied for the fourth-most allowed in a game this season. \"We were just awful today defensively,\" KU coach Bill Self said. \"Their bigs dominated. It was a combination of defensive rebounding, their guards getting where they want, and their bigs destroying us.\"Kansas has dropped two of its last three – both by 16 points – with tilts vs. No. 2 Houston and No. 4 Arizona upcoming over the next week. — Boone\nWinner: AJ Dybantsa's near-triple-double boosts BYU's résuméFor the first time since 2020, BYU has defeated a top-six AP team. More than that, the Cougars needed 27 games to finally beat a top-25 KenPom school, but they got it done over Iowa State on Saturday night in the final big result of the evening. BYU's 79-69 win was also just the second victory vs. a ranked team for the Cougars this season, but at least they've finally got some belief about making a good run in the NCAAs. And they have that belief because Dybantsa had a top-three game of his college career: 29 points, 10 rebounds, nine assists.Cameron Boozer is still a comfortable frontrunner for National Player of the Year, but Dybantsa's in his rearview mirror. Through six February games, Dybantsa's averaging 30.7 points. The win improved BYU to 20-7. No Richie Saunders (ACL) means this team has its limits, but Dybantsa will certainly look to push them in every game that remains in his one-and-done career.BYU is 6-6 in Quad 1 and needs to avoid a slip-up at home on Tuesday vs. UCF in order to make a push toward a No. 5 seed in three weeks. — Matt Norlander\nWinner: St. John's inches closer to Big East titleRick Pitino and his St. John's Red Storm scored their 13th consecutive win Saturday in resounding fashion, dominating Creighton 81-52 and inching closer to their second consecutive Big East title. The win comes just days after fellow conference contender UConn fell at home to the same Bluejays 91-84 in a stunning outcome that has shaken up the Big East race. It leaves St. John's one game up in the league's regular-season standings with UConn set to face Villanova later Saturday night. — BooneWinner: Virginia honors Tony Bennett, beats MiamiVirginia honored former national-title winning coach Tony Bennett by dedicating the court at John Paul Jones Arena in his honor before the game. The No. 14 Cavaliers then followed through by honoring Bennett with a thrilling 86-83 win over a quality Miami team. It wasn't a vintage defensive effort from the Cavaliers, but they made up for it with six players reaching double figures during a 12-of-24 shooting effort from beyond the arc. Jacari White led the way with 17 points on 5-of-8 shooting from 3-point range. — Cobb\nLoser: Vanderbilt loses another heartbreakerNo. 19 Vanderbilt began the day with good news, as star guard Duke Miles returned from a six-game injury absence. Just before tip-off against rival Tennessee, the Commodores were also included in the March Madness bracket preview as a No. 4 seed. But by mid-afternoon, the good vibes had dissipated in a 69-65 loss to the Volunteers. It was only the latest close loss for Vandy, which has dropped three of its past five contests by a combined margin of six points. At 21-6 and 8-6 in the SEC, Vanderbilt is still in the midst of a fantastic campaign, but the \"what if\" moments are starting to add up.  — Cobb\nWinner: Texas Tech dominates without JT ToppinPlaying in its first game without the services of All-American forward JT Toppin, who suffered a torn ACL during the team's road loss Tuesday to Arizona State, No. 13 Texas Tech bounced back with a resounding 100-72 win at home over Kansas State. It's the third-highest scoring game of the season for the Red Raiders' prolific offense, which on Saturday was led by Donovan Atwell (26 points) and Christian Anderson (21 points).  — Boone\nLoser: Ole Miss plays as SEC punching bag (again)An increasingly lost season at Ole Miss took another ugly turn Saturday as it suffered its largest loss of the season 94-75 to SEC-leading Florida. The loss is the Rebels' ninth consecutive stumble in SEC play to drop to 3-11 in conference action after starting 3-2.  — BooneWinner: Sandfort's career day lifts Nebraska past Penn StateNo. 9 Nebraska made quick and easy work of Penn State in Pinnacle Bank Arena thanks to a career-high in scoring from guard Pryce Sandfort, who had 33 points in 35 minutes of play. It's Sandfort's second career 30+ point scoring outing of his career but second this season. He did his damage primarily from deep, as he is wont to do, finishing with eight made 3-pointers on 14 attempts. \nThe win gave Nebraska its 23rd win of the season – tying for its second-most in a single-season in program history. — Boone\nLoser: USC's loss to Oregon costly to TrojansUSC leading scorer Chad Baker-Mazara returned from a three-game absence due to a knee strain, but the Trojans suffered a devastating 71-70 home loss to Oregon anyway. The Trojans led by six with 1:10 remaining before a stunning late collapse that could haunt them on Selection Sunday. USC entered the day as a No. 10 seed in CBS Sports Bracketology, but a drop is likely in store after an inexplicable stumble against a Ducks squad that is just 10-17 (3-13 Big Ten).  — Cobb\nWinner: Georgia trending up after beating TexasGeorgia entered the day as the last No. 9 seed in CBS Sports Bracketology, which isn't a safe place to be this time of year. But the Bulldogs capped off a huge week by beating Texas 91-80. With a Tuesday victory at Kentucky also in hand, UGA (19-8, 7-7 SEC) is once again trending toward making back-to-back NCAA Tournament appearances for the first time since 2001 and 2002. There is work still to be done, but Mike White's club has rediscovered itself after losing five of six games in league play over the end of January and beginning of February.  — Cobb\nLoser: Clemson is cratering after loss to FSUThis Clemson team is starting to resemble the 2023 team that started 18-4 before falling apart and missing the NCAA Tournament. After suffering a 70-65 home loss against Florida State, the Tigers have dropped four straight and are sitting at 20-8 (10-5 ACC) with games against Louisville and North Carolina up next. Clemson entered the day as a No. 8 seed in CBS Sports Bracketology, but its margin for error is rapidly diminishing. If the slide continues against the Cardinals and Tar Heels, the ACC Tournament could be very uncomfortable.  — Cobb\nWinner: Calipari closing in on 900 victoriesArkansas coach John Calipari led his No. 20 Arkansas team to a 94-86 win at home over Missouri to secure his 31st season with 20 or more wins and in the process reached 897 career wins. He is now three wins shy of joining the exclusive 900 club, which is occupied by only five coaches: Mike Krzyzewski (1,202), Jim Boeheim (1,116), Rick Pitino (906) and Bob Knight (902).  — BooneLoser: Washington faceplants to kiss at-large hopes goodbyeWashington's slim margin of error completely evaporated in Saturday's 64-60 loss to lowly Maryland. Washington had one of the top NIL budgets in last spring's portal cycle, and it is facing the music that without winning the Big Ten Tournament, it will not make the NCAA Tournament. Hannes Steinbach continued his stellar freshman season with 14 points on 7-for-8 shooting, but the Huskies shot just 5 for 22 from downtown and got out-rebounded by a baker's dozen. Not great.  — TrotterWinner: Cincinnati gets off the matWes Miller apologized to Cincinnati's home faithful after a dreadful meltdown loss to West Virginia on Feb. 5, and his Bearcats bunch has reeled off a four-game winning streak, punctuated by a stunning 84-68 win over No. 8 Kansas in front of a shocked Allen Fieldhouse crowd. Cincinnati's offseason visions came to life. Big man Moustapha Thiam was dominant, scoring 28 points and ripping down eight rebounds on his birthday. Baba Miller added 18 points, eight assists and seven boards.\"This group's been pretty consistently resilient, which is why I feel so much joy they get to have a moment like this tonight,\" Miller said.Cincinnati (15-12, 7-7 Big 12) is not far from fighting its way back toward the bubble. Tuesday's road clash with JT Toppin-less Texas Tech is enormous   — Trotter\nWinner: UConn bounces back with road win over VillanovaThree days after getting torched by Creighton, UConn's defense had a revival. The No. 5 Huskies held Villanova to just five made buckets in the first 15 minutes of regulation in the second half and ran away with a 73-63 road victory. UConn played nine players. All nine of them scored at least four points, led by a dozen from captain Alex Karaban. 15-1 St. John's vs. 15-2 UConn on Wednesday for Big East supremacy.  — TrotterWinner: Colorado State gets job doneJase Butler and Carey Booth combined for 47 points to help short-handed Colorado State knock off San Diego State 84-73. It's a massive loss for SDSU's quest to win the Mountain West. The Aztecs are now a full two games behind Utah State in the loss column.This one also featured one of the best baptisms of the season, courtesy of the high-flying Booth.  — Cobb\n            ",

    "body": "\n        There will be superstars all over the ice on Sunday morning when the United States and Canada face off in the gold medal game at the Winter Olympics. Which of these two rivals has more firepower? The answer to that question may be what determines the winner.The Canadians probably have more marquee names than the Americans. Connor McDavid and Nathan MacKinnon have four Hart Trophy wins between them, and they're probably the two best hockey players in the world. That's a nice luxury for Canada, but it's not like the U.S. is lacking for star power at the top of its lineup.We've already seen what Quinn Hughes can do in big moments with his overtime goal against Sweden, and reigning Hart Trophy winner Connor Hellebuyck is capable of winning a game on his own between the pipes. That's without even mentioning the one-two punch of two-way centers the Americans have in their top six forward group.\n        \n            \n                Where to watch Team USA vs. Canada: Prediction, start time for men's hockey gold medal game between rivals\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhile Canada holds the edge when it comes to the elite of the elite, the U.S. has the depth to take down a country that has won nine Olympic gold medals in its history. Here are the 10 best players in Sunday's gold medal game (8:10 a.m. ET).\n10. Zach Werenski | D | USAThe U.S. defensive group is deepest and most talented in the tournament, and while Quinn Hughes gets a lot of justified attention, Zach Werenski is right there with him as one of the best defenders in the world. Since the start of the 2024-25 season, Werenski has tallied 144 points, behind only Cale Makar among defensemen.Werenski also boasts a plus-34 five-on-five goal differential in that span, per Natural Stat Trick. At the 2026 Olympics, we've seen the best parts of Werenski's game, from clean zone exits to the frequent creation of dangerous scoring chances.9. Mitch Marner | LW | CanadaMarner is the rare playmaking winger who is capable of driving play on his own, and he can play in all situations. In this tournament, we've already gotten a clear picture of what Marner can do with the puck on his stick. In the Canadians' overtime win over Czechia in the quarterfinals, Marner pulled off an incredible individual effort to score the game-winner.\nA 2023 Selke Trophy finalist, Marner is also a force in the defensive end. His line with Mark Stone on the other wing could create problems for the American offense.8. Macklin Celebrini | LW | CanadaSome may think this ranking is a little high and a little premature, but Celebrini has just been that good, both in these Olympics and his young NHL career. Celebrini has completely revived a rebuilding San Jose Sharks franchise, and he's in the Hart Trophy conversation with 81 points, more than double his next closest teammate.In Milan, Canadian coach Jon Cooper put Celebrini next to McDavid, and that bold move has paid off in spades. Celebrini leads the Olympics with five goals, and he's second to McDavid in points with 10.\n7. Auston Matthews | C | USAMatthews is one of the best goal-scorers in hockey. His 427 goals since his rookie campaign in 2016-17 are the most in the league with the next closest player sitting 20 goals behind him. Matthews has a deceptive and powerful release that helps him beat goalies with ease, but he's not a one-trick pony. Matthews' defensive game has earned him Selke Trophy votes in each of the last six seasons.When Matthews is on the ice, the Americans are capable of scoring from anywhere in the offensive zone.6. Jack Eichel | C | USAOne of the best two-way centers in the NHL, Eichel has been making plays all over the ice for the U.S. through its first five games. Eichel can excel in every situation, and he's currently on pace for a 111-point season with the Vegas Golden Knights. Coach Mike Sullivan has leaned on Eichel a lot at these Olympics, and that won't stop now.\nI'd expect Eichel to be matched up against Connor McDavid whenever possible, and while that is a big challenge for any player, the American center is capable of holding his own.5. Connor Hellebuyck | G | USAHellebuyck has a strong argument to be the best goalie in the league. He's a three-time Vezina Trophy winner and the reigning NHL MVP. When Hellebuyck is on his game, there's little that an opponent can do. Hellebuyck is 6-foot-4 and rarely out of position, making him incredibly tough to beat, and he has been great for the Americans in Milan.Over the last three seasons, Hellebuyck has saved 77.5 goals above average, per Natural Stat Trick. The next closest goalie is Andrei Vasilevskiy at 52.2. Canada's Jordan Binnington is below water at -6.54.\n4. Quinn Hughes | D | USAWhat Quinn Hughes brings to this U.S. team was evident in that dramatic win over Sweden in the quarterfinals. Despite playing big minutes, Hughes was a workhorse in overtime, right up until he ended the game by firing a laser beam past Jacob Markstrom. Hughes is one of the best skaters in the world, and he's able to pair that with his high hockey IQ.The U.S. can deploy Hughes in any situation, and I have a hunch Canada will see a lot of him on Sunday morning. Hughes is one of a few defensemen who can skate with Canada's biggest stars and not look overmatched.3. Cale Makar | D | CanadaA two-time Norris Trophy winner (who is gunning to make it three in 2026), Makar is a dynamic player who impacts games in a similar fashion as Hughes. Makar is special, especially with the puck on his stick, as he uses his skating, stickhandling and vision to make plays that few players can.\nSince his rookie campaign in 2019-20, Makar leads all defensemen with 485 points, which also ranks 16th among all skaters. Makar is a threat to make a big play from anywhere on the ice -- from a stretch pass springing a teammate to wheeling around the offensive zone.2. Nathan MacKinnon | C | CanadaIt's unfair that, in addition to Connor McDavid, the Canadians also have MacKinnon at their disposal. He would be the best player on any other team in these Olympics, and he is playing at a Hart Trophy level for the Avalanche in 2025-26. MacKinnon leads the NHL with 40 goals, and he has seven points in this tournament.MacKinnon is a versatile player who can win with speed, power or some combination of both. However you want to play, he's more than happy to beat you.\n1. Connor McDavid | C | CanadaMcDavid is the best player in the world, and as if he needed to prove that fact, he leads the tournament in assists (11) and points (13). Since his rookie season in 2015-26, McDavid leads the NHL in assists (783) and points (1,178), and he ranks fifth in goals (395). He's also a three-time Hart Trophy winner, a Conn Smythe Trophy winner, a five-time Art Ross Trophy winner and Maurice Richard Trophy winner.One of the few things missing from McDavid's trophy case is a gold medal, and he seems determined to get one of those in Milan. Slowing him down will be a tall task, even for the Americans' elite defense.So who wins the 2026 Winter Olympics men's ice hockey final between USA and Canada, and what are the best bets for this matchup? Visit SportsLine now to see the 2026 Winter Olympics men's ice hockey picks and best bets from a hockey insider, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        LAWRENCE, Kansas — Lost in the sauce of the never-ending Darryn Peterson discourse hides the fact that it's late February, and Kansas still doesn't know quite what makes it tick yet.Bill Self likes this team, but he sure wasn't tickled pink by how his group handled Saturday's test. Unranked Cincinnati waltzed into Allen Fieldhouse and drubbed No. 8 Kansas 84-68 handing the Jayhawks its first double-digit home loss to an unranked opponent since 1993, per CBS Sports research. \"We played soft,\" Self said matter-of-factly.Peterson's spotty availability status has become the story. It's often been distilled down to an argument like this: When Peterson plays, Kansas is  a national championship contender, but…Well, Peterson played a full allotment of 32 minutes against Cincinnati, the most minutes in two weeks, and yet, Kansas' home fans were dipping for the exits long before Saturday's final buzzer sounded.\nThere's been a fog (or Phog?) clouding the reality that Kansas is still in tinkering mode, while numerous other national championship hopefuls have cleared those hurdles and have elevated into a new zip code with March looming.Meanwhile, Kansas' hot-spots emerged for the world to see.KU big man Flory Bidunga has been one of the fiercest defensive players this season, but Cincinnati found real cracks in the armor on the edges of this Kansas defense. Cincinnati forward Baba Miller scored eight of his 12 first-half points when Bidunga was not guarding him. Big man Moustapha Thiam gave redshirt freshman Bryson Tiller the work early and often on the way to a 28-point, eight-rebound showing on his 20th birthday.\n\"That's one heck of a birthday present,\" Cincinnati coach Wes Miller said. \"We all got to feel like it was our birthday tonight. I mean, I didn't know he had 28. I knew he was playing great, but I thought he was terrific.\"\nThe other side of the aisle was not feeling like having a slice of birthday cake.\"I didn't think our bigs played very big today,\" Self said.That's a grave indictment for a national championship hopeful because teams like Michigan and Florida are driven by their enormous front-lines. Bidunga is generously listed at 6-foot-10 and 235 pounds. Tiller is 6-foot-11 but doesn't always play like it. A depth option like 7-footer Paul Mbiya is not part of this rotation right now. Is Kansas big enough to win this thing in the supersized era that is college basketball? On Saturday, it sure wasn't. Cincinnati ripped down 14 offensive rebounds, much to Self's chagrin.Kansas' offense was also entirely rudderless for long stretches. The Jayhawks managed just 1.04 points per possession and managed just two assists over a 15-minute span in a second half gone awry. Peterson scored 17 of the most invisible points. Melvin Council, long the emotional leader of this group, went 3-for-13 from the field. Outside of some empty-side pick-and-rolls for Bidunga to go Turbo Smash on the rim, Kansas' offense found no easy answers against a Cincinnati group that is a top-10 defense.\n\"It's terrible, we didn't play well,\" Self said. \"Against good teams, you're not going to score fast. You're not going to score on the first side (of the floor). We don't have that type of team, and we didn't screen, and we didn't do a lot of things the way that I would hope that we would do it. I got to do a better job of getting us to do. We've shown that we can do it at times, but we certainly didn't do it against a team that demands it being done because they're so sound.\"There isn't any time to lick wounds. No. 2 Houston will saunter into Lawrence on Monday, and the Cougars can steal some of Cincinnati's homework.Houston could out-rebound the Jayhawks by 21, not 11, if Kansas isn't careful. Houston's defense — which is even better than Cincinnati's — could wreck havoc against Kansas if this offense doesn't snap out of the stagnation.\n\"It just wasn't a very tough team today like we're capable of being,\" Self said. \"Hopefully, we get that mindset corrected here. We'll see…\"Kansas does not lose games at home. This is just the 23rd time that a Self-coached club has lost in this basketball cathedral. Back-to-back home losses feel unfathomable.\"Bad, brutal and it sucks,\" Council said. \"We are supposed to defend homecourt always. Losing to UConn, now Cincinnati. We can't do it no more.\"\nLet the tinkering begin because this team has plenty to learn about itself.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Ryan Garcia has the chance to become world champion for the first time in his career on Saturday. Garcia will face WBC welterweight champion Mario Barrios in a high-stakes showdown from T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.Garcia is one of boxing's top stars, though various missteps have set his career back at multiple times. After starting his career 23-0, Garcia was dominated by Gervonta \"Tank\" Davis before Davis scored a seventh-round knockout with a body shot. Two fights later, Garcia put on a career-best performance, knocking down WBC junior welterweight champion Devin Haney multiple times en route to a majority decision victory. Unfortunately, Garcia missed weight for the bout, seemingly not even attempting to make the junior welterweight limit after months of apparent struggles with a mental illness episode playing out on social media. Compounding those issues, Garcia failed his drug test for the fight and the result was overturned to a no-contest.Garcia followed up his suspension from the failed drug test with a listless performance against Rolando Romero, dropping the fight by a clear unanimous decision.\n        \n            \n                Ryan Garcia looks to bounce back from uninspired loss when he faces Mario Barrios: 'Do or die moment'\n                \n                    Brian Campbell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBarrios has also been uneven in his performances in recent years. He was competitive with Davis in their 2021 fight before suffering a knockout in Round 11. That fight was followed by a loss to Keith Thurman. After rattling off a three-fight winning streak that saw him capture the WBC interim welterweight title, Barrios was promoted to full champion, where he has successfully defended his title against Abel Ramos and Manny Pacquiao, though both defenses ended in draws.\nThe undercard on Saturday features plenty of intriguing players in the 140-pound division. WBA junior welterweight king Gary Antuanne Russell gets a tough test from Andy Hiraoka in a featured bout. And former title challenger Frank Martin is in action when he faces Nahir Albright with both men looking to get back to the title level.Check out how you can watch the action on Saturday night below, but be sure to check out our staff predictions and expert picks for the main event as well.Where to watch Barrios vs. GarciaDate: Saturday, Feb. 21 | Location: T-Mobile Arena -- Las VegasStart time: 5:45 p.m. ETWhere to watch: DAZN PPV | Price: $69.99Barrios vs. Garcia fight card, oddsOdds via DraftKings Sportsbook\nRyan Garcia -250 vs. Mario Barrios (c) +195, WBC welterweight titleGary Antuanne Russell -350 vs. Andy Hiraoka +260, WBA junior welterweight titleFrank Martin -390 vs. Nahir Albright +290, junior welterweightsWho wins Mario Barrios vs. Ryan Garcia on Saturday, and which pick should you target for a huge payday? Visit SportsLine now to see Josh Nagel's best bets for the Saturday welterweight title bout, all from the combat sports specialist who has covered the sport for more than 20 years, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        One of college basketball's longest streaks in the AP poll era ended Saturday following Cincinnati's 84-68 thumping of eighth-ranked Kansas, a jolting setback for a Jayhawks team who were projected as a 3-seed in the East by the NCAA Tournament selection committee a few hours prior. The Jayhawks hadn't lost to an unranked team at home by 10 or more points since 1993, which spanned a nation-leading 425 consecutive games. Cincinnati 7-footer Moustapha Thiam poured in a career-high 28 points and helped the Bearcats pull away down the stretch with a 3-pointer with 7:35 to play after Kansas had moved within a possession.\"We were just awful today defensively,\" Kansas coach Bill Self said. \"They were great. Their bigs dominated. Their guards, we didn't pressure them and they got what they wanted to. ... it was a combination of defensive rebounding, their guards getting to where they want to go. But their bigs, they destroyed us.\"It was a particularly disheartening performance given the Jayhawks' play since overcoming a 1-2 start in Big 12 play to win nine of their last 10 games. Expecting another high-end outing Saturday afternoon coming off recent victories over BYU, Texas Tech and Utah, Kansas failed to land body blows in the second half to a Bearcats team that pulled to .500 this season in conference play.\nThe 16-point home loss was the Jayhawks' largest to an unranked opponent since 1973, besting a 15-point setback to Long Beach State in 1993 when Kansas was ranked No. 1.This marks the fourth-largest home loss Kansas has suffered under Self with all the others coming against ranked competition. Cincinnati made 12 of 21 attempts from behind the 3-point line and sent Jayhawks fans to the exits early with a home showdown against Houston looming on Monday night.Lost by 25 to No. 8 Texas on Jan. 2, 2021Lost by 23 to No. 14 TCU on Jan. 21, 2023Lost by 18 to No. 12 Kentucky on Jan. 29, 2022The Jayhawks were one of five Big 12 teams to receive a top-16 seed in Saturday's NCAA March Madness bracket preview. They'll try and regroup next week with the first of two pivotal contests against the conference's top teams.Self said his team played \"soft\" and had lacked energy on the glass after getting out-rebounded by Cincinnati, 40-29.\n\"We respected the opponent, but the bottom line is, we didn't bring it as a unit from an energy standpoint, like you got to when they're good,\" Self said. \"I mean, we played a NCAA Tournament team today. There's no doubt about that. They've had their moments this season where they've been inconsistent and not as good, but they were great today.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Although Ryan Garcia has tried his best throughout the build to their WBC welterweight title clash to frame his former trainer's hiring by opponent Mario Barrios as an act of treason, Joe Goossen's presence is likely to play a key role in the result of Saturday's pay-per-view headliner. Goossen, the 72-year-old broadcaster and Hall-of-Fame trainer, has had a relationship with Garcia (24-2, 20 KOs) dating back to his amateur days and worked his corner as head trainer for three consecutive fights, culminating in a 2023 PPV knockout loss to Gervonta \"Tank\" Davis.Despite the fact that Garcia and Goossen parted ways on good terms (amid industry rumors that questioned Garcia's work ethic and suggested he never truly bought in to Goossen's teachings), Garcia used the storyline to create a circus of their introductory press conference in January to announce this weekend's fight (DAZN PPV, 7:55 p.m. ET) inside T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. Not only did the 27-year-old Garcia, a native of Victorville, California, join his father/trainer Henry in attempting to create a soap opera by feigning heartbreak over Goossen's decision, the younger Garcia also presented a t-shirt with Goossen's name on the front and the word \"traitor\" on the back and threw it at his former coach. \nWhen asked by CBS Sports on Tuesday whether he was truly emotional over the situation or whether this was yet another attempt by the enigmatic Garcia to stir the pot and play mental games with his opponent, \"King Ryan\" shared a sly smile.\"I don't know how I actually feel about it, I just know my first instinct was a little laughter within myself,\" Garcia said. \"[I thought to myself,] 'That's pretty, pretty funny.' I say that with sarcasm. I wonder if [Barrios] even thought about it. Did he think about it? I guess nobody gives a f--- in this game. Cool, let's f---ing go. Now, I'm really going to rip this dude's head off and I'm going to beat his ass in front of [Goossen] bad.\"It's always a little bit of motivation within myself. It's almost as if you want to whip his ass more just to show them that I don't care who is training him, I'll whip his ass bad.\"\nFrom the perspective of Barrios, a 30-year-old from San Antonio, there isn't a single part of the Garcia-led sideshow that matters to him ahead of the fight. In fact, he claims his decision to part ways with trainer Bob Santos in favor of Goossen had nothing to do with Garcia at all. \"The move to go be with Joe was going to happen whether this fight with Ryan was made or not,\" Barrios told CBS Sports last week. \"I was looking at what steps I wanted to make moving forward to continue to grow as a fighter and work on myself. I wanted to get back to some of the things that got me this far in the first place. I think it's just a lot of noise and drama. I feel like the press conference didn't have anything to do with me. It just had everything to do with Joe Goossen, Ryan and their past.\"The reason why Goossen's role is so integral to this fight is because he knows so much about what makes the inconsistent Garcia tick. For as spectacular as Garcia can look in one fight, he has so routinely battled with mental health challenges and outside-the-ring controversies that he has yet to fulfill the huge potential that comes along with his lightning fast hands, snapping power and gigantic social media following as a boxing superstar who organically built his image and following. \nGarcia looked sensational in dropping Devin Haney three times in their 2024 title clash but had his decision win overturned after he tested positive for the banned substance ostarine and engaged in one public meltdown after another during his one-year suspension. Garcia returned last May against WBA welterweight titleholder Rolando Romero as a heavy favorite but was dropped in Round 2 en route to losing a bizarre and lifeless decision. \"You know, there are many reasons [for the Romero loss in New York's Times Square,]\" Garcia said.\" It's very interesting looking back at how the energy actually was and why it was that way. I have my speculations but I don't even want to look back because I know right here is in front of me. I'm just looking forward to this moment and that's it because this has better vibes and you know that.\"Barrios doesn't just have inside knowledge on Garcia with Goossen, however, he also has the perfect coach (known for his offensive approach and ability to resurrect struggling boxers) to potentially bring back the fire in him that has been lacking in recent fights. \nIn 2023, Barrios looked as if his career had turned a major corner when he widely outpointed and retired former champion Yordenis Ugas to capture the WBC interim title. But a string of inconsistent performances followed as Barrios was forced to settle for back-to-back draws in title defenses against Abel Ramos in 2024 and 46-year-old Manny Pacquiao last July while being criticized for not doing enough offensively when it mattered. \"I definitely feel like people are always going to talk and write your name off,\" Barrios said. \"You can go in there and perform sensationally and there will always be somebody that will find something. I am definitely proud of [my performance against] Pacquiao but there are things I would've done differently. I definitely should have pressed the gas early on and I think it would have been a different fight. That's why I think there wasn't much interest in a rematch. I feel like they knew that it's the best that he can look right now.\"\nGarcia remains the betting favorite against Barrios largely because of his brighter ceiling of potential and the fact that Barrios, who has previously headlined PPVs against Keith Thurman and Davis, has yet to win a major fight in which his face has been on the poster. But Garcia also needs to prove entering his fourth division that he can finally win a recognized world title and that his best performance to date against Haney wasn't a result of banned substance use.\n\"I do see it favoring me but it's because I'm the better fighter, that's it,\" Garcia said. \"That's what I have been putting into this camp. I see [Barrios] as a warrior that has been through a little bit of wars that is starting to wear him down. I don't think the new trainer switch into a fight like this is a good move and he's about to find out that it ain't a good move, at all. I think it's all going to backfire.\"Let's take a closer look at the rest of the undercard with the latest odds from getting to a prediction and expert pick on the main event below.Barrios vs. Garcia fight card, oddsOdds via DraftKings SportsbookRyan Garcia -250 vs. Mario Barrios (c) +195, WBC welterweight titleRichardson Hitchins (c) -380 vs. Oscar Duarte +280, IBF junior welterweight titleGary Antuanne Russell (c) -350 vs. Andy Hiraoka +260, WBA junior welterweight titleFrank Martin -390 vs. Nahir Albright +290, junior welterweightsPredictionThe flaws and inconsistencies of both fighters have the potential to play as big a role in the outcome of the fight as do their respective strengths. \nGarcia completely fell apart mentally in losses to both Davis and Romero as soon as he felt their heavy power flush in the early going. The problem for Barrios, however, is that he isn't a puncher at 147 pounds on the level of either of those names. When Barrios is at his best, he's an aggressive boxer who goes to the body and leads the dance. But like Garcia, at his worst, he can lose focus in a hurry and begin to follow his opponent around. The X-factor in this fight is undoubtedly going to be the hand speed and power of Garcia, who by far owns the biggest weapons in the matchup. Even if Barrios, who is the more consistent boxer of the two in recent years, can build an early lead, the potential for Garcia to package knockdowns in an effort to build a formidable lead on the scorecards is there, even if he doesn't score a finish against the durable Barrios. \nPick: Garcia via UD12Who wins Mario Barrios vs. Ryan Garcia on Saturday, and which pick should you target for a huge payday? Visit SportsLine now to see Josh Nagel's best bets for the Saturday welterweight title bout, all from the combat sports specialist who has covered the sport for more than 20 years, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The Dallas Cowboys have locked up one of their top performers from the 2025 season, signing free agent-to-be running back Javonte Williams to a new three-year, $24 million deal, sources told CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones. Williams deal will reportedly include $16 million guaranteed, as the former Broncos running back cashes in after a breakout 2025 campaign while playing on a one-year deal in Dallas. The Cowboys made sure to give Williams a deal in line with his market value before he hit free agency to avoid having to replace his strong production from 2025. Williams rushed for 1,201 yards and 11 touchdowns on 252 carries for the Cowboys in 2025 -- reaching career-highs in all three categories. He also caught 35 passes out of the backfield for 137 yards and two touchdowns, providing Dak Prescott with a comfortable check down target. \nWith Williams' deal done, the Cowboys can shift their focus to their other free agents, with wide receiver George Pickens the most notable potential departure. Pickens also had a career-year in his first season in Dallas, tallying 1,429 receiving yards and nine touchdowns to lead the team in both categories. Pickens will be hoping to get a contract that pays him like the top-end receivers in the NFL, but it remains to be seen if Dallas is willing to make such a long-term offer with CeeDee Lamb already on a 4-year, $136 million deal (with $100 million guaranteed). If the two sides can't agree to a new deal, Lamb would be a prime franchise tag target for the Cowboys at a price of $28 million for the 2026 season. \nThe Cowboys have just over two weeks to get a Pickens deal done, but with Williams out of the way it's one fewer concern for Jerry Jones, Stephen Jones and the Cowboys ahead of the March 9 opening for the legal tampering period to free agency. \n            \n",

    "body": "\n        College basketball fans will get an absolute treat on Saturday with a rare marquee nonconfrence showdown in the month of February between No. 1 Michigan and No. 3 Duke. After No. 2 Houston lost earlier this week to Iowa State, this game will more than likely determine who is ranked No. 1 in the AP Top 25 poll on Monday and the team that is in the driver's seat for the No. 1 overall seed in next month's NCAA Tournament. Duke and Michigan have combined for just three losses heading into the weekend. Duke lost to Texas Tech back in December and fell on the road earlier this month to in-state rival North Carolina after the Tar Heels hit a go-ahead 3-pointer with 0.4 seconds remaining after trailing the entire game. The Wolverines have won 11 consecutive games since losing to Wisconsin earlier this month. Michigan remains in firm contention to win the Big Ten regular season title. The Wolverines have a 2.0-game lead over Illinois heading into the weekend with just four conference games remaining in the regular season.  \n        \n            \n                Bracketology: Experts predict NCAA Tournament bracket before committee reveals early top 16 seeds\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMeanwhile, Duke is 2.0 games ahead of Virginia in the ACC standings, also with four games remaining. Duke faces Virginia at home next weekend. \nHere is everything you need to know ahead of Duke's matchup with Michigan on Saturday.  Duke vs. Michigan: Need to know  No. 1 overall seed on the line: This game not only has major stakes for next week's AP poll, but also the top line of the NCAA Tournament. The winner of this game will be in the driver's seat to earn the No. 1 overall seed in CBS Sports Bracketology.  No. 3 Duke and No. 1 Michigan are 1-2 in WAB -- a new metric the committee will be looking at -- and the NET rankings. Duke and Michigan are tracking to be placed on opposite sides of the NCAA Tournament bracket, which could make this game a potential national title preview if both teams make it to Indianapolis. Frontcourt is the strength of both teams: Michigan's strength is its frontcourt. The Wolverines have one of the best frontlines in the nation in the trio of Morez Johnson Jr., Yaxel Lendeborg and Aday Mara. Michigan will face its toughest test yet, with a matchup against Duke big man Cameron Boozer, the current national player of the year frontrunner. Boozer has been the most consistent player in the sport. Boozer is a walking double-double. Mara is one of the best shot blockers and defenders in the nation. The key to this one will come down to how Michigan can slow down Boozer. \nGuards will be asked to step up: Yes, the strength of both teams is their frontcourt play, but the guards could also decide this game. On the Michigan front, Elliot Cadeau is familiar with Duke as anyone. He spent the last two seasons at North Carolina before transferring to Michigan last offseason. Cadeau's backcourt mate, Nimari Burnett, is a steady veteran presence. On the other side, Duke guard Isaiah Evans has stepped up and become the clear-cut No. 2 option. There are question marks about Duke's point guard play, with Caleb Foster and Cayden Boozer sharing that responsibility. Boozer has seen his role increase lately. That's a good thing for all parties.  Where to watch Duke vs. Michigan live  Date: Saturday, Feb. 21 | Time: 6:30 p.m. ET Location: Capital One Arena -- Washington, D.C. TV: ESPN | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)   Duke vs. Michigan prediction, pick  \nThis game is a rare nonconference Final Four/national title preview in February. It's truly going to be a toss-up. Duke and Michigan rank 1-2 in adjusted defensive efficiency, per KenPom.com, and are also No. 1 and 2 in most other metrics. The key will be the frontcourt and 3-point shooting. Duke shots 34.9% from the 3-point line, while Michigan knocks down 36.1% from beyond the arc. In a sense, Boozer has become almost underrated because people have just gotten used to how dominant he is. This is an opportunity for him to show everyone why he's a Tier 1 NBA Draft prospect. Duke wins behind Boozer and Evans. Pick: Duke +2.5\n \t \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            UM -2.5\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    STRAIGHT-UP\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    Who will win and cover in every college basketball game? Visit SportsLine to get picks from the model that simulates each game 10,000 times and is up more than $1,200 for $100 players on its top-rated spread picks the past six years. \n            ",

From snowboarding events to ice hockey, there is not a lack of events to tune into.Chloe Kim is chasing history, looking to be the first halfpipe snowboarder to three-peat at the Olympics and is looking to defend her title, winning the world championship last season. The 25-year-old Team USA snowboarder has a good chance, as she topped qualifications on Wednesday. Maddie Mastro and Bea Kim are two other Americans in the final looking for a medal.Downhill champion Breezy Johnson is also looking for another medal and will compete in the Super-G on Thursday.\nAlso, the United States men's hockey team will begin its quest for its first podium since earning the silver medal at the Vancouver Games in 2010 and -- of course -- that golden \"Miracle on Ice\" finish at Lake Placid, New York, in 1980. Thursday's preliminary game will be against Latvia.The Milan Cortina Games will run through Sunday, Feb. 22, and in total of 119 events will take place with 245 medals handed out to the athletes. Fans can find the action on NBC and their streaming service Peacock, with an account or a cable login.\nThe Winter Games have eight main sports, with 16 disciplines. With so many events to keep up with, it can get overwhelming, but that's where we step in with the overall medal tracker and daily schedule.Winter Olympics schedule for Thursday, Feb. 12SportEvent(s)TimeMedal EventCurlingWomen's round robin, United States vs. South Korea; Japan vs. Sweden; Italy vs. Switzerland; Canada vs. Denmark3:05 a.m.NoSkeletonMen's heats 1 & 23:30 a.m.NoFreestyle SkiingMen's Moguls qualification 24 a.m.NoSnowboardingMen's Snowboarding Cross Seeding runs 1 & 24 a.m.NoAlpine SkiingWomen's Super-G5:30 a.m.YesIce HockeyMen's preliminary, Switzerland vs. France6:10 a.m.NoFreestyle SkiingMen's Moguls final runs 1 & 26:15 a.m.YesBobsleighTwo-man official training heats 1 & 2 6:50 a.m.NoCross-Country SkiingWomen's 10km Interval Start Free7 a.m.YesSnowboardingWomen's 10km Interval Start Free7:45 a.m. - 9:15 a.m.YesCurlingMen's round robin, United States vs. Switzerland; Norway vs. Germany; Great Britain vs. Sweden8:05 a.m.NoBobsleighWomen's Monobob official training heats 1 & 29:30 a.m.NoSpeed SkatingWomen's 500m10:30 a.m.YesIce HockeyMen's preliminary, Czech Republic vs. Canada10:40 a.m.NoSki JumpingWomen's LH official training 111 a.m.NoLugeTeam Relay12:30 p.m.YesCurlingWomen's round robin, United States vs. Sweden; China vs. Great Britain; Denmark vs. Japan; Italy vs. South Korea1:05 p.m.NoSnowboardWomen's Halfpipe final runs1:30 p.m.YesSki JumpingMen's LH official training 12 p.m.NoShort Track Speed SkatingWomen's 500m quarterfinals; Men's 1000m quarterfinals; Women's 500m semifinals; Men's 1000m semifinals; Women's 500m final A; Men's 1000m final A2:15 p.m. - 3:43 p.m.YesIce HockeyMen's preliminary, United States vs. Latvia; Germany vs. Denmark3:10 p.m.No\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Islam Makhachev is ready to fight fellow UFC champion Ilia Topuria at the White House.Makhachev vs. Topuria is arguably the best fight the UFC could make, pitting CBS Sports' No. 1 and No. 2 pound-for-pound fighters against each other. Recently, Makhachev expressed interest in fighting Topuria, likely at welterweight, where Makhachev reigns as champion.\"I like this idea,\" Makhachev told Serbian outlet Telegraf about the Topuria fight. \"If  the UFC wants [this fight], I know a lot of MMA fans want this fight,  I'm ready.\" Makhachev expressed interest in fighting at the upcoming UFC event at the White House, which UFC president and CEO Dana White recently told CBS Sports will be \"the most watched UFC event ever.\" The card is scheduled for June 14, coinciding with President Donald Trump's 80th birthday. It gives Makhachev ample time to resume training after fasting for Ramadan.\n\"We have the Ramadan month, I'm not  going to train for one month,\" Makhachev said. \"After that, I will slowly begin my  training camp, and I will be ready. White House [or] other dates, I will  be ready.\" Topuria has been calling out Makhachev for some time. Topuria vacated the featherweight title last year to fight for the lightweight title. However, Makhachev had already relinquished the 155-pound belt to prepare for a welterweight campaign. Makhachev previously expressed no interest in returning to lightweight, preferring to rack up title defenses at 170 pounds.\"In my division, a lot of contenders who deserve the title fight,\"   Makhachev said. \"UFC just has to give me a new target. That's it. I'm   just waiting.\" \nTopuria must likely bulk up to an additional weight class to challenge his fellow two-division champion. He's expressed a willingness to do so if it meant fighting Makhachev, though \"El Matador\" has business at lightweight, too. Topuria resumed training last week after reportedly settling a legal dispute with his ex-wife. During Topuria's absence, Justin Gaethje defeated Paddy Pimblett to win the interim lightweight title at UFC 324. Topuria and Gaethje are expected to unify their titles at a later date.\n            ",

In that post, Vonn said her injury -- a complex tibia fracture -- would require multiple surgeries to repair, and on Wednesday she offered another update following her third surgery with a photo from her hospital bed in Italy. \n\nI had my 3rd surgery today and it was successful. Success today has a completely different meaning than it did a few days ago. I'm making progress and while it is slow, I know I'll be ok. Thankful for all of the incredible medical staff, friends, family, who have been by my side and the beautiful outpouring of love and support from people around the world. Also, huge congrats to my teammates and all of the Team USA athletes who are out there inspiring me and giving me something to cheer for. ❤️🤍💙In the photo, the extent of the injury is evident in the amount of bracing on Vonn's leg. However, even in the face of what seems likely to be a career-ending injury, Vonn continues to express gratitude and appreciation for fans supporting her journey back to competition. \nVonn's return to the Olympics saw her return to the top of the downhill standings this season, but a crash in Switzerland a week before the games threatened to derail her comeback after she suffered a torn ACL in her left knee. Vonn was able to get cleared by doctors to continue competing, and after successfully completing her training runs, she was still a podium contender heading into Sunday's downhill. \n        \n            \n                Lindsey Vonn has 'no regrets' after Olympics crash as skiing figures defend her decision to race on torn ACL\n                \n                    Carter Bahns                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nEarly in her run, Vonn clipped a gate as she came over a jump that caused her to get off balance and led to the crash that made for a cruel ending to an inspiring comeback bid. As she explained in her first post, she was just five inches too far inside on her line, pushing herself to the limit as always trying to get every edge possible. \nThat willingness to push boundaries made Vonn a legend, and her resilience in the face of injuries and heartache continues to make her a beloved figure in American sport. \n            \n    ",

Over the course of those two weeks, athletes from 92 countries -- not including Russia or Belarus -- will compete in 16 different sports.At the 2022 Beijing Olympics, the United States finished tied for third in the gold medal count, just behind Norway and Germany. The U.S. brought home nine gold medals, which was tied with China in that category, but the Americans finished fifth in the overall medal count with 25.Team USA will try to improve upon those numbers in 2026, and they have some golden opportunities to do just that. Both the men's and women's hockey team should be in the running for a gold medal, Jordan Stolz is a favorite in speed skating, Chloe Kim is hitting the halfpipe in snowboarding and Mikaela Shiffrin will once again be on the ski slopes. And figure skaters Alysa Liu and Ilia Malinin have high potential to reach the podium.\nNorway will attempt to defend its title as the most awarded country in the Winter Olympics, both from 2022 and all-time. The Norwegians won 16 gold medals and 37 total medals at the Beijing Games four years ago, and they possess a large edge in the all-time medal count. Norway has won 148 gold medals and 406 total medals in its 24 appearances at the Winter Olympics. The Americans are a distant second with 330 total medals.Russian and Belarusian athletes are permitted to compete, but only as individuals under a neutral flag. They'll be classified as \"Individual Neutral Athletes,\" and their medals won't factor into the overall count. Russian and Belarusian teams are still banned from competing the Olympics.\nKeep track of the live medal count over the next couple weeks as the United States looks to fill up its trophy case while competing across Northern Italy.

In 31 starts and one relief appearance for Toronto, he pitched to a 3.96 ERA and a 4.01 FIP with 166 strikeouts in 170 ⅓ innings. For his career, Bassitt owns an ERA+ of 114 across parts of 11 big-league seasons. He's earned one All-Star selection and on three occasions finished in the top 10 in the Cy Young vote. Earlier in the offseason, CBS Sports ranked Bassitt as the No. 34 available free agent in the 2025-26 class. Here's part of RJ Anderson's write-up: \n\"You won't find many pitchers like Bassitt, who chucks his primary pitch (a sinker) more than 40% of the time and yet still manages to throw seven other offerings at least three out of every 100 tosses. (Those other eight pitches include a cutter, curve, four-seamer, sweeper, splitter, slider, and changeup.) Most of Bassitt's matériel grade out as average, give or take, but he's found success by mixing, matching, and locating. His durability (he's started 30-plus times four years running) and kitchen-sink approach make him a useful pitcher to have on hand during the regular season. It is telling, though, that the Blue Jays left him out of their postseason rotation.\"In Baltimore, Bassitt will join a remade rotation that also includes Shane Baz, who was acquired in trade from the Rays. The Orioles are hoping to rebound from a disappointing 2025 campaign in which they lost 87 games and finished last in the AL East. Last season, Baltimore ranked 24th in MLB in rotation ERA and 25th in rotation FIP. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Few voices in golf carry more weight than that of Rory McIlroy, so when he weighs in on whatever the latest hot topic among golf fans and pundits might be, folks tend to listen. As McIlroy arrived stateside for his first PGA Tour event of the 2026 season at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, he was asked about the latest round of debate regarding The Players Championship and where it falls in the hierarchy of golf's biggest events. The Players has established itself as the premier event on the PGA Tour schedule outside of the major championships, leading some to believe it should be considered a \"major\" given its quality of field and the stiff challenge presented by the Stadium Course at TPC Sawgrass. McIlroy has long been a strong supporter of The Players as an elite event on the calendar -- even noting that he believes it has a better identity than the PGA Championship -- but he does not buy into the idea that it should be elevated alongside that tournament, the Masters, the U.S. Open and The Open Championship.\"The Players is one of the best golf tournaments in the world. I don't think anyone disputes that or argues that. From a player perspective, it's amazing. From an on-site fan experience, it's amazing. It's an amazing golf course, location, venue. \"But I don't -- like again, I'm a traditionalist, I'm a historian of the game. We have four major championships. If you want to see what five major championships looks like, look at the women's game. I don't know how well that's went for them. But it's The Players; it doesn't need to be anything else. \"I would say it's got more of an identity than the PGA Championship does at the minute. So, from an identity standpoint, The Players has got it nailed. ... I don't think it being classified a major or not a major makes it any more or any less [important]. I'm still very proud to have won that tournament twice, as I'm sure all the other champions are. It stands on its own without the label.\" McIlroy is a two-time winner at The Players, a five-time major champion, and as of last April, a career grand slam winner, so his perspective on the matter is valued.What McIlroy said about The Players having a stronger identity than the PGA Championship is from which much of the \"major\" debate stems. To that end, McIlroy suggested the PGA should flip back on the schedule, once again becoming the final major on the calendar.\"I think glory's last shot,\" said McIlroy when asked what identity the tournament should take. \"I think it needs to go back to August.\"The PGA Championship moved from August to May in 2019 with The Players moving from May to March. The PGA is often viewed as the fourth major, largely because it lacks the same unquestioned identity as the other three.\nThe Masters is staged at an iconic location each year at Augusta National Golf Club, kicking off the major season. The U.S. Open stakes its reputation on being golf's toughest test -- for better or worse -- and The Open is the oldest championship, one that shines a light on links golf. The PGA would push back on McIlroy's claim by stating its identity is being the \"strongest field in golf\" as it invites the top 100 players in the world without any amateurs competing. McIlroy believes it was better positioned as the last opportunity for players to capture a major championship each season. As for The Players, adding the \"major\" label could threaten what has made it such a beloved tournament. It stands out as the PGA Tour's flagship event, and it gets the early spotlight to itself in March. If it were to become a major, the Masters would likely insist The Players moves to May (PGA to August) to ensure the green jacket continues to be awarded first.\nThe Players nevertheless feels like a major, especially when it's at its best. It has a purse equivalent to one, too, without the added pressure. If it were to become a \"major,\" it would face similar challenges to the PGA, including the annual discourse about whether the event is worthy based on how exciting it plays.The truth is that The Players doesn't need the label to carry its own weight; in fact, not being attached to the majors works in its favor.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Victor Wembanyama dropped 40 points against the Lakers Tuesday night, reminding everyone that yes, he's the most dominate player in the league on both ends of the floor. This performance should come with a asterisk, as the Lakers were without Luka Dončić, Austin Reaves, LeBron James and Deandre Ayton. If those four guys played, the game would have certainly been far closer, but it likely wouldn't have stopped Wembanyama from having a big night. He put up those 40 points in just 26 minutes of action.It was Wembanyama at his absolute best. Draining 3s (four to be exact), punishing guys in the paint with an array of turnaround jumpers, dunks and layups and taking defenders off the dribble with ease.\nFour blocks and two steals are what the box score showed defensively, and his presence on the floor deterred the Lakers from challenging him at the rim. But it was Wembanyama's offense that set the tone for the Spurs from the opening tip. Twenty-five of his 40 points came in the first quarter. And by the time the fourth quarter rolled around, Wembanyama was able to watch the remainder of the game from the sideline with a win easily in hand.\"What got me going was just honestly proving myself a point, proving my team a point,\" Wembanyama told reporters after the game. \"I'm not worried about us, not worried about me against good teams, but history has showed that I need to be worried about us against teams like this. So yeah, I mean, we don't just talk about what we need to do. We need to actually act.\"\nThe Spurs sit second in the Western Conference, and have rattled off wins against some of the other best teams in the league. But -- as young teams tend to do -- they've also been caught playing down to their opponent. Losses against the sub-.500 Hornets and Pelicans, and two close wins against the Mavericks show that this team isn't always consistent. Wembanyama wanted to show that the Spurs shouldn't be playing with their food going against a Lakers team without their top players.\"I was also pushing to go back, but I mean, they did the right thing by keeping me on the bench,\" Wembanyama said of sitting in the fourth quarter. \"We got to think long term. But yeah, these kind of games, you got to have the greed. I mean, every game you have to have this greed to want more every time, because you know at all times it doesn't matter who's on the court, it's somebody who's going to want to stop you from doing what you do out there. So you got to be greedy.\"Wembanyama's efficient 40-point outing was the fifth time in the league's shot clock era that a player has amassed that many points in 26 minutes or less. He also joined Patrick Ewing as the only other player to put up a 40-point double-double in that few of minutes.\nThe win pulled the Spurs to within 3 ½ games of the top-seeded Oklahoma City Thunder. A couple months ago it seemed impossible for anyone to catch the Thunder atop the West, but a recent 5-5 stretch in their last 10 games has opened the door for San Antonio. The Spurs have been the Thunder's biggest competition in the regular season, beating the defending champions four times already. If the Spurs somehow leap the Thunder in the standings by season's end, the conversation won't just be about how impressive they've been with a team this young, but also about can San Antonio be the team representing the Western Conference in the NBA Finals. With the way Wembanyama's been playing, it's not out of the realm of possibility.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        A pair of blockbuster trades were announced between a trio of NWSL teams on Wednesday, the separate deals set to add new layers of intrigue to the 2026 season – and perhaps to the U.S. women's national team picture, too.Croix Bethune will join the Kansas City Current from the Washington Spirit in a package worth a total of $1 million, as first reported by CBS Sports, which marks a new chapter in the 2024 NWSL Rookie of the Year's career as she papers for her first full season after recovering from a meniscus tear. In a separate deal, Bay FC acquired USWNT midfielder Claire Hutton after sending $1.1 million the Current's way for her services. The pair are rising stars in the NWSL and have made their way inside the USWNT's player pool, each of them offering valuable skillsets to their new teams and providing signals of ambition as the start of the 2026 season nears. The moves, though, also add another layer of intrigue in a league that is defined in some ways by its busy offseasons.For both Bethune and Hutton, changing clubs at the start of 2026 will offer ample time to settle in before USWNT head coach Emma Hayes has to lock in roster decisions for November's Concacaf W Championship, the qualification tournament for next year's World Cup. There are a fascinating number of unknowns with each of these deals, though, especially as it pertains to the Current's abilities without Hutton.Here's analysis of the headline-grabbing moves, including an assessment of how well each party stacked up after the big trades.\nBay FCBay FC have yet to light the league up since joining as an expansion team in 2024 but in landing Hutton, they have given themselves a real opportunity to compete. The 20-year-old is easily one of the U.S.' rising stars, settling into the demands of being a professional seamlessly and positioning herself to be one of the game's top talents in her position for years to come. Just about every team in the world would benefit from Hutton's arrival and by acquiring her, Bay have demonstrated serious ambition ahead of head coach Emma Coates' first season in charge. Hutton will not solve all of their problems but she undoubtedly gives them the opportunity to go up a level, an opportunity they would be silly to waste. Grade: AKansas City CurrentBethune is more than capable of being a positive addition to the Current thanks to her attack-minded style of play and the sheer entertainment value she brings every time she's on the field. With nine goals and 15 assists in her two seasons as a professional, she will be a boon to a Current team that boasts plenty of attacking talent and should combine nicely with Temwa Chawinga once the Malawi international returns from a long-term hip adductor injury. Separate from Bethune's attributes, though, Hutton is a huge loss for the Current and how exactly the team fills that void is a big unknown as they chase silverware after a record-breaking regular season in 2025. Grade: B\nWashington SpiritBethune requested the trade in a move the Spirit's president of soccer operations, Haley Carter, described as one motivated by \"her desire to explore development opportunities in a different environment.\" She will be missed by the Spirit but in exchange, Bethune's old team will have plenty of money to play with. Like the Current, they are chasing the NWSL Championship that continues to elude them, and the Spirit have a well-documented history of spending wisely. How exactly this money will get used is unclear – NWSL player salaries are not public information, so whether or not Trinity Rodman's new deal impacts their wage bill and plays even a small role in Bethune's move away is uncertain. Even if the funds from the Bethune trade go into the players they already have, though, it will go a long way in keeping a talented group of players happy and motivated ahead of an important campaign. Grade: A-\n            ",

    "body": "\n        While he never played for the coach, former Steelers outside linebacker Joey Porter is going to bat for Mike Tomlin while taking aim at two former teammates who have been outspoken about Tomlin since he decided to step down as Pittsburgh's leader. Fellow former Steelers outside linebacker James Harrison has been extremely vocal in his criticism of Tomlin, going as far as to say he isn't a Hall of Fame-caliber coach. Former quarterback Ben Roethlisberger hasn't been as extreme, but he did make headlines when he suggested late in the 2025 season that Tomlin should become Penn State's new coach. Roethlisberger has since said on his podcast that it was probably time for a change regarding the Steelers' coaching post. Porter, who also served on Pittsburgh's coaching staff from 2015-18, was largely diplomatic in terms of his comments regarding Harrison, but things got personal when he discussed Roethlisberger, his teammate from 2004-06. \"Seven definitely broke the brotherhood,\" Porter said on Steelers defensive tackle Cameron Heyward's podcast. \"The shit that Seven did that we don't talk about is crazy. Out of anybody, he should never grab a microphone and really talk Steelers business, because if we're talking Steelers business, his ass is foul of all foul, like the shit that he did is foul of all foul. \n\"He's not a good teammate. Won a Super Bowl with him, but the person, he's just not a good teammate. Like he knows that, anybody in the Steeler building knows that, but we protected him, because I've only won one Super Bowl, and that was my quarterback. So do I love my quarterback? Yeah, but is he a good person? No.\" When asked why he felt Roethlisberger was a bad teammate, Porter mentioned that Roethlisberger did not sign autographs for teammates' family members during his rookie season. Porter, a team captain at the time, decided to have a meeting with Roethlisberger after he specifically declined to sign something for defensive end Aaron Smith. \"Who the hell is too cool to sign for your teammate?\" said Porter, alluding to former teammate and Hall of Fame running back Jerome Bettis and his constant willingness to do things for teammates and fans. \"I always looked at it like this. Look at the team when Joey was a captain, when Jerome was captain, when Hines Ward was a captain. You heard nothing in the locker room. \n\"Captains have to do captain shit, right? We voted to be captains; you had to be voted in. He came in an era where they just gave you a seat, because if he wasn't a captain, he'd probably have a hissy fit, but nobody's going to vote for him as captain because he don't have no captain qualities.\"Beyond his alleged locker room issues, Roethlisberger was suspended for four games in 2010 amid a violation of the NFL's personal conduct policy, as multiple women accused him of misconduct in 2008 and 2010. \"I got caught up being Big Ben the whole time,\" Roethlisberger said at the time. \"I lost track of who Ben Roethlisberger was. It's not something I'm proud of. \n\"Big Ben just kept building up. It ended up coming off the field. It kept taking over. Superman kept taking over Clark Kent and you just never saw who Ben Roethlisberger was anymore. At the time, I didn't see it. I was gaining everything, but I was losing a lot of who I was raised to be.\"Roethlisberger himself previously acknowledged that he wasn't always the best teammate. He did, however, maintain some close relationships during his early years in Pittsburgh with several teammates, specifically Bettis and former tight end Heath Miller, among others. In later years, he developed a close bond with center Maurkice Pouncey, who was inducted into the Steelers Hall of Honor this past year alongside Roethlisberger and Porter. In 2019, departing teammates Le'Veon Bell and Antonio Brown both questioned Roethlisberger's leadership or lack thereof. One of their criticisms of Roethlisberger was that he didn't spend enough time with them outside of the facility. \nRoethlisberger appeared to respond by hosting Pittsburgh's skill players at his lake house that offseason. He also pulled the plug on his local radio show, which often led to public criticisms of teammates, like Martavis Bryant in 2015 and fellow receiver James Washington in 2018. In later years, Roethlisberger publicly vouched for several teammates to get contract extensions, like running back James Conner prior to Conner becoming a free agent after the 2020 season. In 2021, his final season in Pittsburgh, Roethlisberger agreed to a contract restructure that cleared $15 million, which helped Pittsburgh re-sign JuJu Smith-Schuster, one of Roethlisberger's favorite receivers. While he at least appeared to be a better teammate during his later seasons, Roethlisberger wasn't perfect. In 2018, for example, he loudly questioned the Steelers' decision to draft fellow quarterback Mason Rudolph, who supported Porter's comments on social media. He recently alluded to the Steelers giving him a \"center that had never played center before\" for his final season (he has since apologized to said center, Kendrick Green). \nRoethlisberger also hasn't been shy as it relates to how his career in Pittsburgh ended. While he ultimately chose to retire instead of playing elsewhere, he acknowledged that at least one of the Steelers' head decision-makers didn't want him back after the 2021 season. It appears that led to the harboring of some negative feelings, at least on Roethlisberger's side. As far as the criticism of Tomlin is concerned, Roethlisberger and Harrison have their own podcasts and have never been afraid to express their opinions. And while both are entitled to their stances, Porter doesn't feel that either is in a position to speak negatively of someone who did so much for their careers, his included. \"What makes it crazy for me to watch them two talk like that and really act like we don't have the real receipts of how this really works,\" Porter said. \"Like, you know what he just did for y'all? ... When they tell their stories, you'll think Mike didn't do shit for them. I don't know how to shit on somebody that looked out for me.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Super League project is now officially over. It took almost five years to see it end and this was made official this week when Real Madrid and UEFA (the European governing body) both announced an agreement on Wednesday, ending the possibility of seeing an alternative competition around Europe in the coming years.\"Following months of discussions conducted in the best interests of European football, UEFA, European Football Clubs (EFC), and Real Madrid CF announce that they have reached an agreement of principles for the well-being of European club football, respecting the principle of sporting merit with emphasis on long-term club sustainability and the enhancement of fan experience through the use of technology,\" the announcement said. \"This agreement of principles will also serve to resolve their legal disputes related to the European Super League, once such principles are executed and implemented.\"Here's a look back at what the Super League idea was, what it was supposed to look like and more:What was the Super League?The European Super League was a proposed breakaway soccer tournament announced in April 2021 by 12 of Europe's biggest clubs. It was designed to rival (and effectively replace, for its members) the UEFA Champions League, allowing the clubs more control. The founding clubs were:\nReal MadridBarcelonaAtletico MadridManchester UnitedManchester CityLiverpoolChelseaArsenalTottenhamJuventusAC MilanInterThe initial plan, which was received negatively by most of the fans around the world, was to create a closed competition, where the founding members would have permanent spots, and then there would be limited spots available for others based on the domestic league performances, but also threatening the value of the same leagues, something that was worrisome for many, especially smaller clubs. While most of the big clubs initially agreed on the project, some of the coaches and players of the teams linked immediately argued against the proposed project, supporting the backlash of the fans and other teams around Europe. In particular, PSG and Bayern Munich opposed the idea and didn't join the project while other presidents as    Real Madrid's Florentino Perez and former Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli were the leaders of the new project. Agnelli, who stepped down from his roles in 2023, was serving as president of the European Clubs Association (ECA) when he helped launch the Super League project. He resigned from the ECA shortly after the announcement was made.Why it didn't work out?After the initial fear among the fanbases and the clubs not involved, the situation got even more tense. The reaction from fans, players, coaches, and the media was overwhelmingly negative, and within 48 hours of the announcement, all six English clubs had withdrawn from the project, a clear victory for those against it with the intense backlash and the initiative's poor planning and organization taking a quick toll. Manchester City were the first club that announced its decision to back out, two days after the first official statement.\n\"Manchester City Football Club can confirm that it has formally enacted the procedures to withdraw from the group developing plans for a European Super League,\" the club announced. Former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp was also one of the first big figures to speak up publicly about the project, and in typical fashion, he didn't hold back. \"I hope this Super League will never happen. With the way the Champions League is now running, football has a great product, even with the Europa League. For me, the Champions League is the Super League, in which you do not always end up playing against the same teams. Of course, it's economically important, but why should we create a system where Liverpool faces Real Madrid for 10 straight years? Who wants to see that every year?\" \nKlopp was followed by some players, including Manchester United's Bruno Fernandes. The Portuguese midfielder posted a caption on his Instagram account that read \"Dreams can't be bought.\"Later, the Super League organizers, A22 Sports Management, a company formed to \"sponsor and assist\" in the creation of the European Super League, announced it would be exploring plans to relaunch the competition while the European Court of Justice ruled in December 2023 that a ban on the Super League could be in conflict with the European Union regulations.\nHowever, the public perception of the Super League, as it was announced, shaped its reputation and led Real Madrid, the last club involved, to forget about the chances of a new competition in the coming years. In February 2026, Barcelona also announced their decision to leave the project a few days before the latest announcement made by Real Madrid and UEFA, putting an end to any small amount of life the project may have had. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Just when you think the NWSL preseason is settling ahead of the new calendar year, the big moves keep coming. Kansas City Current have acquired midfielder Croix Bethune from Washington Spirit, sources tell CBS Sports. Washington Spirit are set to receive a record-matching fee for Bethune. The deal is finalized though not set to be announced until a later date.North Carolina Courage currently holds the record for intraleague funds ($1.25 million) after trading Jaedyn Shaw to Gotham FC last year. Bethune is coming off a successful two-year stint with the Washington Spirit, where she won the 2024 NWSL Rookie of the Year. In her first pro season, she tied Tobin Heath's decade-old single-season assist record in just 17 games thanks to a season-ending torn meniscus. She also won the league's inaugural NWSL Midfielder of the Year award. Her impressive rookie season earned her a place on the 2024 Olympic gold medal-winning U.S. women's national team, and she's recorded seven caps so far.Sources also confirmed that the player requested the trade, and her former club worked to complete the deal. Bethune received interest from other teams, though now she'll be joining the league's reigning NWSL Shield winners. \nShe often showcases her vision with short, elegant passes and is a certified playmaker. Her move to Kansas City is a welcome arrival following the departure of recent playmaker and goal scorer Bia Zaneratto. The Brazilian international left the club after her contract expired and returned to Palmeiras in free agency.Bethune's rise to prominence was anything but easy. The player has had to bounce back from a torn meniscus that cut her NWSL rookie season short. In college, the player tore her ACL twice, but was drafted into the NWSL after earning two-time first-team All-American and Pac-12 Midfielder of the Year honors with a career that saw her start at Southern California and finish at Georgia. She's shown she can bounce back and contribute and now joins Kansas City after her recent camps with the U.S. women's national team and a short preseason stint with the Spirit. \nWashington Spirit make it officialFollowing CBS Sports' reporting that Bethune's movement came by way of request, the Spirit announced Bethune's departure on Wednesday. Bethune's move to Kansas City yielded a club-record $100k in allocation funds and $900k in transfer threshold funds, the third-largest return in NWSL history. \"We are grateful to Croix for her contributions over the past two seasons. After conversations about her desire to explore development opportunities in a different environment, we were able to structure a deal that honored her request while securing significant value for our club, making it the third-highest intra-league transfer in NWSL history and a top ten mark globally,\" said club president of soccer operations Haley Carter. \"We evaluate every situation on its individual merits, and in this case, the alignment of player goals and organizational value made sense for all parties. That said, our focus is on the talented core we have returning. We're heading into 2026 healthy, deep, and ready to win.\"\nClaire Hutton moves on from Kansas City CurrentKansas City Current also traded midfielder Claire Hutton to Bay FC on Wednesday. The Midwest club received $1.1 million in intraleague transfer funds for the 2025 NWSL Best XI honoree, who is also a member of the USWNT. \"Claire is an important signing for us. She's a top-quality player who is tight on the ball, and she has the mobility and physical presence to break up play,\" said Bay FC head coach Emma Coates.\"Despite her age she brings experience and a strong mentality, and we believe she has the potential to become one of the best midfielders in the world. The most exciting part for us is her desire to keep getting better, and we're excited to support her through the next stages of her career and even more excited to see the impact she will have at Bay FC.\" \nThe 20-year-old Hutton was a 2024 NWSL Rookie of the Year finalist and leaves Kansas City Current as a rising star in the NWSL and U.S. women's national team. Hutton signed her first professional contract in 2024 at 17 years old with Kansas City, the sixth player signed under the league's Under-18 Entry Mechanism, and she has since become a regular club starter with a bright future for her new club and her country.She has 13 appearances for the USWNT since her debut in 2025, and recently, head coach Emma Hayes discussed a leadership role with the midfielder, who is the youngest player to captain the national team in the Hayes era. When could they make official debuts?The Kansas City Current open up their season hosting the Utah Royals at 4 p.m. ET on Saturday, March 14, while Bay FC host expansion side Denver Summit the same day with kickoff set for 6:30 p.m. ET.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Of the 34 starting quarterbacks who have won a Super Bowl, Sam Darnold's story is one of the most unique. The No. 3 pick in the 2018 NFL Draft, Darnold toiled on bad New York Jets teams before having a brief reprieve with the Carolina Panthers and then blossoming into a Pro Bowler with the Minnesota Vikings. After late-season struggles, the Vikings deemed Darnold expendable, though, which led to him signing a multi-year contract with the Seattle Seahawks, whose faith in Darnold was quickly rewarded with another Pro Bowl season that culminated in the franchise's second Super Bowl win. Seattle celebrated that victory on Wednesday, and Darnold was quick to show his appreciation for the team that brought him in as a free agent.\"I've talked a lot this last week about belief,\" Darnold told the crowd during Wednesday's victory parade. \"A lot of people didn't believe in me, but it didn't matter because the ones that are close believed in me, including you all. I appreciate you all so much. That short list also includes [team owner] Jody Allen, [general manager] John Schneider, [coach] Mike Macdonald. I appreciate the belief you all had in me for signing me this past year.\n\"And last but certainly not least, these players, man, for believing in me. I wouldn't be here without these guys.\"\nThroughout the season, Darnold received public support from his teammates that included some fiery comments in Week 11 from linebacker Ernest Jones IV. Jones went out of his way to praise Darnold when it was his time to address the crowd on Wednesday.\"Not only do we have the best defense in the world, we've got the best team in the world,\" he said. \"And quite frankly, if you've got anything to say about my quarterback, if you've got anything to say about my defense, if you've got anything to say about our o-line, if you've got anything to say about the city of Seattle, I've got two words for you: f--- you!\"\nWhile he played on a strong team with an elite defense, Darnold played a significant role in Seattle's success this season. He out-dueled league MVP Matthew Stafford during Seattle's come-from-behind win over the Los Angeles Rams in Week 16 and did so again in the NFC title game. In the Super Bowl, Darnold more than held his own against a New England Patriots defense that was constantly jumping routes and blanketing his receivers. On the game's first drive, Darnold completed several tough passes that helped set up the first of Jason Myers' Super Bowl record five field goals. Darnold and Patriots counterpart Drake Maye had their struggles, but Darnold's play started to elevate as Kenneth Walker III piled up yards on the ground. With New England's defense focused on Walker, Darnold took advantage and helped the Seahawks put together six scoring drives. His 16-yard touchdown pass to AJ Barner that made it a 19-0 game early in the fourth quarter. \nAnd with a strong core intact, the Seahawks believe they can compete for years to come. \"We're not done,\" defensive end Leonard Williams said. \"We're coming back next year.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Six months into a season, it is not unusual to know what to expect from any given team on any given day and that was certainly the case for anyone who cared to check on Tottenham Hotspur on Tuesday as they faced Newcastle United. A sluggish team who seemed a step or two behind the opponent in terms of intensity levels? Check. A porous defense that seems to lack chemistry? Check. An attack that has very few ideas? Check. Few redeeming qualities as the team slouched to yet another Premier League defeat? Check again.Thomas Frank, whose months-long spell in charge of the team finally came to an end after their latest drab performance, did not create all of Spurs' issues. He is right to point to the fact that he, like his predecessor Ange Postecoglou last season, had to contend with an injury crisis of epic proportions, all while captain Cristian Romero serves a suspension for a red card in their 2-0 defeat at Manchester United on Saturday. He was not wrong to note that this very team finished 17th in the Premier League last season, an admission that the ceiling is only so high for the current iteration of Spurs. Frank, though, did not do himself a single favor during his brief stint in north London, emerging as a rare example of a coach who truly earned a promotion to the big leagues but failed to prove his worth for the most part.Frank's tenure with Spurs is remarkable for all the wrong reasons, the Denmark native unable to live up to the billing in any real sense. He was supposed to be a practical alternative to Postecoglou, who spent much more time ensuring his team had a functioning attack than a competent defense. It was not the only issue the next coach should have theoretically fixed – his Brentford side were organized when defending set pieces and impactful on the flip side, a signal that Frank's Spurs would be efficient on both ends of the pitch.His perceived pragmatism, though, was mistaken for ability. Frank inherited a mess but he also failed to improve the issues that were fully in his control. There were very few categories in which Frank made a noticeable positive impact, an underperformance that is easy to spot regardless of how one chooses to define success. Averaging 0.1 more point per match compared to Postecoglou's Spurs last season is not much of a flex, and neither is making an improvement of 0.3 goals against per game when the team ranks 13th in the Premier League when sorting for expected goals against. If Postecoglou was reckless for allowing a porous back line to take shape despite boasting brilliant defenders in Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven, Frank is guilty of the same crime despite having the upper hand of a fit first-choice center back duo for much of the season.\nTottenham (2025-26)Tottenham  (2024-25) Brentford (2024-25)Points per game1.11.01.5Goals per game1.41.71.7Expected goals per game1.11.61.6Goals against per game1.41.71.4Expected goals against per game1.51.71.5Spurs' defensive shortcomings were hard to ignore even in a superficial watch on any given matchday. The defenders at his disposal had years of experience alongside one another and yet appeared completely disjointed, the natural result of Frank failing to lock in tactical foundations and going back to the drawing board more often than a coach of his caliber usually does. His defenders seemed unsure of their next move, unable to rely upon their instincts and mistake-prone as a result. Frustration and despair oozed out of the players each time a goal was conceded, no matter how predictable it was; contempt grew amongst the fanbase, who were more prone to booing than cheering quickly enough in Frank's tenure.Frank's Spurs underperformed in equal measure in front of goal. The coach had the bare bones of an attacking idea from the start of the season, one that seemed to go hand-in-hand with Spurs' odd squad construction. He would bypass midfield for the most part and instead prioritize play on the wings to generate attacking opportunities, a solution of sorts for a team that lacked any real passers after James Maddison tore his ACL in preseason, all while nicking a few goals off of set pieces. That plan did not pan out all that much – Spurs' attacking statistics this season are buoyed by an early season blitz in which they outperformed their expected goals tally, a run of beginner's luck that is generally hard to sustain.In no time at all, Spurs were out of ideas. Completing simple attacking plays was a difficult task, while their game was never built around earning more set pieces even though it was the rare area of the game they actually excelled in. At times, Frank sucked the life out of games instead, hoping his disinterest in scoring goals would grind opponents' attacks into dust. The coach gave an overly conservative approach the runout a handful of times last fall in matches that could have served as statement-making performances and at this point, it should come as no surprise that it did not work. Spurs tallied three shots and 0.12 xG in a 1-0 loss to Chelsea in which the Blues were unlucky not to have scored more as they racked up 15 attempts and 3.68 xG. Days later, Arsenal made sure not to waste their chances – they cruised to a 4-1 win as they tallied 17 shots and 1.93 xG, all while Spurs had three shots and 0.07 xG to speak of. It was evidently worse than Postecoglou's figures, but even Frank's own in his final season at Brentford.The inability to defend and attack properly was visible even at the end of Frank's tenure, perfectly encapsulated in the final goal Spurs conceded before his firing. His side could not complete a simple breakaway minutes after notching an equalizer against Newcastle, instead letting Anthony Gordon dance around a still Spurs defense before Jacob Ramsey popped the ball into the back fo the net.\nFrank's Spurs were lifeless, a whiplash-inducing exercise for anyone who remembers watching Postecoglou's version of the team. It was strange to watch Frank's Spurs give attacking a try for 45 minutes at a time every third or fourth game and then settle into a defensive structure that they could not maintain, inviting opponents into the match rather than killing the game entirely. Almost singlehandedly, he demonstrated that the belief that pragmatism is inherently efficient is a trope rather than a tried and tested philosophy for success in this sport. There is nothing practical about taking the foot off the gas when things are trending in the right direction. It is not effective to keep taking a stab at a losing strategy, hoping it will finally turn good. It is painfully unrealistic not to find a way to lean on your strengths, even if they are few and far between. There is nothing sensible about failing to lay down tactical foundations, rendering your team unable to execute a stylistic vision that seems like a prerequisite to being an elite coach.With Frank at the helm, Spurs merely dragged their feet through matches as if they were simply there to collect an attendance award rather than play. No one wins trophies with style points but Frank proved one can certainly lose without them, his team always hitting the pitch with a sense of aimlessness. It is no wonder, then, that he drew the ire of the Spurs faithful, who, unlike his team in attack, wasted no chance to lambast him for spearheading a \"boring, boring Tottenham\" – in every sense, he sucked the entertainment value and the inherent joy out of the game. In a landscape where the sport's next great managers increasingly prefer tactical rigidity, Frank's Spurs will act as a prime example in the downside of straying too far down that path. Being cautious does not inherently come with rewards, nor does it necessarily come with stability and in this case, it can slowly contribute to the erosion of an already decaying product. It forces existential questions, too, of what exactly the point of this particular exercise was for a team in desperate need of a course correction.Spurs' squad may not be up to the task of finishing even remotely close to a UEFA Champions League spot, but neither is Frank. In an age where clubs are quick to dispose of managers, he was given a chance but threw it away completely, the glimmer of hope that came in the UEFA Super Cup outing against Paris Saint-Germain an outlier rather than the start of a promising trend. Frank's firing will require a serious rethink by Spurs' leaders, many of whom are brand new to their roles after longtime chairman Daniel Levy's exit in September, because their current woes are the result of years of mismanagement and remarkably poor squad building, their trip to the Champions League final seven years ago now a distant memory of a long-gone era.\n            ",

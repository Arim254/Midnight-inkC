    "body": "\nNow that the Kansas City Chiefs' three-year reign atop the AFC is over, the royal rumble to take over the throne is on.The Denver Broncos (12-2) have ridden 11 straight wins to the best record in the conference, while the New England Patriots (11-3) feature MVP candidate Drake Maye, who leads the NFL in completion percentage (70.9). The Buffalo Bills (10-4) are never out of a game with the arm and legs of quarterback Josh Allen, and the ascending Houston Texans (9-5), who are allowing just 16.3 points per game, own one of the league's best defenses in years.The Broncos (+300), Bills (+370), Texans (+500) and Patriots (+600) are the top four favorites to win the AFC at DraftKings Sportsbook.But where are the Jacksonville Jaguars? In the free-for-all that is this year's AFC race, the Jaguars are getting no love. Even though they have the third best record (10-4) in the conference and lead the AFC South, they are just +650 to win the conference, behind all four teams above.That could change on Sunday if Jacksonville knocks off Denver at Empower Field in a game with enormous ramifications for the Jaguars. With three games remaining in the regular season, Jacksonville enters Week 16 with a one-game lead over Houston in the division. The SportsLine Inside the Lines team and Projection Model say the Jaguars have a 50% chance to win the AFC South.If they beat the Broncos on Sunday, that percentage jumps to 74.5%. But if Jacksonville loses to Denver, that chance crashes to 37.2%.Entering Week 16With winWith lossChance to win division50.0%74.5%37.2%After facing the Broncos, the Jaguars play the struggling Colts (8-6) and quarterback fossil Philip Rivers in Week 17 in Indianapolis and the Tennessee Titans (2-12) in Week 18. Jacksonville is likely to be favored in both.That's why the Jaguars can apply a hammerlock on the AFC South title with a victory on Sunday. Jacksonville is a 3-point underdog against the Broncos at DraftKings.\nConversely, a loss would be detrimental to the Jaguars' division hopes. The second-place Texans host the Raiders (2-12) on Sunday and are favored by more than two touchdowns. If Jacksonville loses and Houston wins, the Texans would overtake the Jaguars for the lead in the division based on a better division record. Houston also would have the better conference record.The Texans' last two games are at the Chargers (10-4) and against Rivers and the Colts, so Jacksonville would still have some hope if it falls in Denver but wouldn't control its destiny. The Jaguars enter Week 16 playing arguably their best ball of the season. They have won five in a row and are coming off a 48-20 win over the Jets in which quarterback Trevor Lawrence set career highs in passing touchdowns (five), touchdowns accounted for (six) and passer rating (136.7). On Sunday, Lawrence and Jacksonville will face a Broncos defense that is tied for third in the league in points per game allowed (18.6). \"Getting to go play a competitive, meaningful game in December is really what it comes down to,\" Jaguars coach Liam Coen said Wednesday. \"Hostile environment. A very quality opponent. A team that's won the fourth quarter in a lot of football games over the last two years. It's a great opportunity for us to go compete and earn everything we get.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        A fresh take on exhibition golf will take place under the lights on Wednesday when Scottie Scheffler, Rory McIlroy and their respective squads face off against one another at Trump National Golf Club. Dubbed the 2025 Golf Channel Games, the exhibition will see two teams of four compete in a series of fun, fast-paced events designed to mimic challenges from other sports leagues.Scheffler and McIlroy teamed up victoriously this time last year in Las Vegas for an exhibition match against LIV Golf members Brooks Koepka and Bryson DeChambeau, but this time, they will be on opposite sides.The two teams will traverse through a series of five challenges -- timed driving, timed short game, timed relay, 14-club challenge and finally a head-to-head matchup between Scheffler and McIlroy where they will strike shots from specific areas against one another. Whichever team garners the most points will win the overall competition.Golf Channel Games teamsEach team features a good friend to the de facto captain, a familiar face from the Ryder Cup and somewhat of a wild card selection.\nRory McIlroyScottie SchefflerShane LowrySam BurnsLuke DonaldKeegan BradleyHaotong LiLuke ClantonGolf Channel Games formatTimed drive competition: Players compete head-to-head with two minutes on the clock, launching drives onto a scoring grid. Timed short-game competition: This consists of individual action with players chipping the ball within a certain distance of the pin and holing out a specific number of putts at a distance, all with 3 minutes set on the clock.Team relay: Strategy will be crucial here as each team of four will play alternate shot across three holes. Teammates will be staged in certain positions -- one on the tee, one in the fairway, two on and around the greens -- and whichever side finishes with the best score in the shortest amount of time wins.14-club challenge: Two players will compete head-to-head. The groups of two will pull clubs from the same golf bag and strike shots from predetermined distances in the fairway during a closest-to-the-pin contest. Once a club is used, it is eliminated, meaning each player will strike seven different shots with all 14 clubs used. All eight players in the competition will compete across four head-to-head matchups.Captain's challenge: McIlroy and Scheffler will battle head-to-head. Each player will strike shots from various distances, a bunker, greenside and putts of 30 feet and 10 feet. Whomever has the lowest combined distance from the hole for the shots will win.Where to watch Golf Channel gamesDate: Wednesday, Dec. 17 | Start time: 7:30 p.m. ET Course: Trump National Golf Club — Jupiter, FloridaTV: Golf Channel, USA NetworkStreaming: Fubo (Try for free)\n            ",

Fenway Sports Group (FSG) is selling the franchise to the Chicago-based Hoffmann family investment group, per NHL insider Frank Seravalli.The sale price is $1.7 billion, according to Elliotte Friedman of Sportsnet. That comes in exactly where Sportico valued the Penguins at the start of the season, which was a 16% increase from the previous year.FSG, which is led by co-founder John Henry, just purchased the Penguins back in 2021 when it struck a deal with the former ownership group led by franchise legend Mario Lemieux. Back in July, The Athletic reported that Lemieux was \"very interested\" in regaining his controlling stake in the team. However, that bid apparently fell short as FSG accepted the Hoffmann family bid.\n\n        \n            \n                NHL Power Rankings: Can the Wild's acquisition of Quinn Hughes shake up the West's power balance?\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAlthough it is selling the Penguins, FSG still owns some of the biggest brands in international sports, including the Boston Red Sox, Liverpool and Roush Fenway Keselowski Racing.David Hoffmann is the founder and chairman of the Hoffman Family of Companies, and this is not the group's first foray into hockey. The investment company also owns the Florida Everblades of the ECHL, as well as Hertz Arena, where the Everblades play in Estero, Florida.\nThis sale comes when the Penguins are in a period of transition on the ice. In 2023, the team's streak of 16 straight postseason appearances came to an end, and Pittsburgh hasn't returned to the playoffs since. Franchise legends like Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang are in the twilight of their careers, and the Penguins may soon be forced to usher in an entirely new era as they slip out of the playoff picture this season.\n            \n    ",

Competing in front of my family, friends, and community made this experience even more meaningful, and I'll always be proud to have represented this university and this city. \"After careful thought and prayer, l've decided to take the next step in my journey.

He won the Biletnikoff Award, which honors the nation's top wide receiver, over Ohio State's Jeremiah Smith and UConn's Skyler Bell. Lemon caught at least one touchdown pass in eight games this season as USC went 9-3. During his three-year college career, Lemon registered 137 catches for 2,008 yards and 14 touchdowns. \nUSC, No. 16 in the final College Football Playoff rankings, is scheduled to play TCU in the Alamo Bowl on Dec. 30. Lemon is not expected to play. Lemon's NFL Draft stockLemon is the No. 17 overall prospect in the CBS Sports NFL Draft Prospect Rankings. However, he could go higher in the draft than his ranking. CBS Sports draft analyst Blake Brockermeyer mocked Lemon at No. 13 to the Carolina Panthers earlier this week.\"Lemon plays with a defensive mentality at the catch point and brings a competitive edge,\" Brockermeyer wrote. \"He's a problem in the slot due to his ability to create separation and make plays after the catch.\"\nAnother analyst, Josh Edwards, mocked Lemon at No. 20 to the Pittsburgh Steelers.\"D.K. Metcalf is locked in with Pittsburgh long-term, but the team has been searching for a complimentary skillset,\" Edwards wrote. \"Makai Lemon is that predominant slot player, who can make plays in space and create yards after the catch.\"Impact on USCLemon's announcement shouldn't come as a shock to Lincoln Riley's team. Lemon is expected to compete with Arizona State's Jordyn Tyson and Ohio State's Carnell Tate for WR1 in this class after having a standout junior season. Lemon isn't the only star wide receiver from USC declaring for the NFL Draft, as Ja'Kobi Lane already announced his intention to enter the draft.\nWhile USC will have to replace its top three pass catchers from this season (Lemon, Lane and tight end Lake McRee), star quarterback Jayden Maiava is returning to school for the 2026 season. At receiver, Tanook Hines is a name to keep an eye on for an expanded role next season. He enters the bowl 28 catches for 398 yards and two touchdowns. USC, which finished with the No. 1-ranked recruiting class in the 247Sports rankings for the class of 2026, should enter next season -- Year 5 for Riley -- with major expectations.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        One day after Miami Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel said \"everything is on the table\" regarding benching Tua Tagovailoa, McDaniel followed through. With Miami officially eliminated from playoff contention, rookie quarterback Quinn Ewers will start for the Dolphins in Week 16 against the Cincinnati Bengals, McDaniel told reporters Wednesday.Zach Wilson will be Ewers' primary backup; Tagovailoa will be the emergency third-string quarterback.\"The decision is complicated but simple,\" McDaniel said Wednesday. \"The simple piece is I think Quinn gives this team the best chance to win. Our focus is, obviously, to win the next three games, but in particular, like I told the players, we are focused on beating the Bengals, so that was the motivation.\"McDaniel said the decision \"wasn't easy for [Tagovailoa] to hear\" but that he \"exhibited what makes him a captain and a leader on this team.\"\n\n        \n            \n                Tua's ride is over: Dolphins staring down an expensive divorce as they turn -- for now -- to Quinn Ewers\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTagovailoa, 27, went 22 for 28 for 253 yards, two touchdowns and an interception and took four sacks in Miami's 28-15 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers on Monday night, but the box score doesn't reflect how poorly he played. Both touchdowns came after the game had already gotten well out of hand. Through three quarters, he recorded just 65 passing yards and an interception.\"Well I think the quarterback play last night was not good enough, and so for me, everything is on the table,\" McDaniel said Tuesday.In 14 games, Tagovailoa completed 67.7% of his passes for 2,660 yards, 20 touchdowns and a league-leading 15 interceptions, which also marks a career high. The Dolphins won four straight games entering the \"Monday Night Football\" contest against the Steelers, but that had often been in spite of Tagovailoa, who only threw three touchdown passes with three interceptions over that span.\nTagovailoa said he and McDaniel had a brief conversation Wednesday and said he was \"disappointed\" to hear of his demotion.\"I would say the biggest thing, and it's being honest with myself as well, has been my performance,\" Tagovailoa said. \"I haven't been performing up to the level or the capabilities that I have in the past.\"Tagovailoa said injuries have not played a role in his poor performance and added that his job, even as a backup, is to help the team win games. Asked about his future with the Dolphins -- a decision that has quickly come into view with this move -- Tagovailoa said he can only control what he can control.\nTagovailoa signed a four-year, $212.4 million contract extension with $167 million in guarantees in July 2024. Moving on from Tagovailoa this offseason would be difficult for Miami. The former No. 5 overall pick is signed through 2028, and he carries a $56.4 million cap hit in 2026. Still, his benching could mark the beginning of the end of the Tagovailoa era in Miami.And Tagovailoa might not be the only notable player from the last few seasons moving on. Tyreek Hill, who suffered a season-ending knee injury in late September, reacted to Tagovailoa's benching with a viral GIF of a man disappearing.\nCBS Sports' Jonathan Jones had previously reported the Dolphins are expected to move on from Hill after this season.\n            ",

    "description": "\n        Newcastle United are one step closer to defending their EFL cup title thanks to a headed goal from 19-year-old Lewis Miley in stoppage time, ",
    "body": "\n        Newcastle United are one step closer to defending their EFL cup title thanks to a headed goal from 19-year-old Lewis Miley in stoppage time, but it was a performance where Fulham pushed the Magpies to the brink in a 2-1 game. Yoane Wissa scored his first Newcastle United goal only 10 minutes into the match before Fulham answered back in the 16th via Sasa Lukic of an assist from American left back Antonee Robinson. Robinson was everywhere during the match, but in the second half, Fulham ran out of steam as Newcastle eventually found a deserved winner.\nBut it's not a result that should take anything away from Fulham and what they can accomplish with a healthy Robinson. No player on Fulham took more touches than the American fullback, as he's critical to what Marco Silva wants the team to do in the build-up. It's been a frustrating start to the season for Robinson due to injuries keeping him out of the XI, and this match was only his sixth appearance of the season in all competitions, but it didn't take much time for him to grab his first assist of the season.Pushing the pace, Joachim Andersen was able to find Robinson out wide, and he delivered a perfect cross into the center of the box that any of three Fulham players running onto the ball could've headed in. Lukic was there for the goal, but this is where Robinson's vision and passing ability take center stage. Last season, Robinson established himself as one of the top left backs in the entire Premier League, netting 10 assists, but knee injuries have limited him for club and country this season.\nFully healthy now, the festive period will be critical for Robinson -- especially after fellow United States men's national team starter Tyler Adams went down with an MCL injury. He's been used as an inverted fullback to push possession for the USMNT, and his play for Fulham shows why that's a great role for him as he grows as a Premier League player and inches closer to 200 appearances for the club in all competitions.Playing in the EFL Cup, Robinson was able to log 90 minutes in back-to-back matches for the first time this season as he gets back to full fitness ahead of what will be a busy 2026. With the USMNT shifting to a back three under Mauricio Pochettino, Robinson is someone who will be key to any success that the USMNT have at the World Cup on home soil, as he's become one of the first names on the team sheet.\nIf he can get back to last year's form, there's even a chance for Fulham to push from 14th into a European place. They're only six points off Crystal Palace in fifth place, something that shows just how competitive the league has been. It's a moment that should have every team think, why not us? And for Fulham, with Robinson pushing them forward and Harry Wilson pulling off audacious strikes in the attack, why not them? The cogs are there; they just need to stay healthy.\n            ",

These guys are normal human beings too, bruh.\"\nRoss has more than seven million subscribers on Twitch and nearly two million on Kick, a more recent streaming service and the one hosting the stream Nacua was on.\nThe NFL has a history of fining players for criticizing officials. In 2023, the league fined Kansas City Chiefs coach Andy Reid $100,000 and quarterback Patrick Mahomes $50,000 for their criticism following a loss to the Buffalo Bills. More recently, the NFL fined Will Anderson Jr. and Joe Mixon $25,000 for criticizing the officiating in a Houston Texans playoff loss to the Chiefs last year. Both players, however, successfully appealed the fines.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\nAfter seven seasons of mediocrity or worse, the South Florida Bulls enjoyed their greatest success since posting a 10-2 record in 2017, winning nine of their 12 regular-season games. They now have the opportunity to win their third straight bowl game and fifth in six attempts, but they'll have to do it with an interim head coach and backup quarterback.Defensive line coach Kevin Patrick and No. 2 QB Gaston Moore lead the charge when South Florida takes on Old Dominion (9-3) at 5 p.m. ET in the Cure Bowl at Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Fla. Patrick has taken over the head-coaching position on an interim basis following the departure of Alex Golesh, who was hired by Auburn in late November. Moore makes the first start in the final game of his collegiate career as Byrum Brown has elected to sit out the contest after having a stellar regular season.South Florida, which rolled past Rice 52-3 in their regular-season finale, has scored a total of 86 points in its last two bowl appearances. Under Golesh, the Bulls trounced Syracuse 45-0 in the 2023 Boca Raton Bowl and edged San Jose State 41-39 in five overtimes in last year's Hawaii Bowl to improve to 8-4 in bowl games.Old Dominion is making its fourth appearance in a bowl game. After defeating Eastern Michigan 24-20 in the 2016 Bahamas Bowl, the Monarchs lost to Tulsa 30-17 in the 2021 Myrtle Beach Bowl and dropped a 38-35 decision in overtime to Western Kentucky in the Famous Toastery Bowl two years later. Later Wednesday, Louisiana (6-6) and Delaware (6-6) square off at 8 p.m. ET in the 68 Ventures Bowl at Hancock Whitney Stadium in Mobile, Ala. The Ragin' Cajuns were crushed by TCU 34-3 in last year's New Mexico Bowl, while the Blue Hens are making their first bowl game appearance since falling 17-14 to Eastern Kentucky in the 1982 Pioneer Bowl.Only two games are on Wednesday's NBA schedule, including a matchup between the Memphis Grizzlies (12-14) and Minnesota TImberwolves (17-9) at 8 p.m. ET at the Target Center in Minneapolis. The Timberwolves hope to remain hot, as they've won seven of their last eight overall contests and six of seven at home.Five contests are on the NHL slate, one of which has the red-hot Carolina Hurricanes (21-9-2) visiting Bridgestone Arena to face off against the Nashville Predators (13-15-4) at 8 p.m. ET. The Hurricanes occupy first place in the Metropolitan Division and are in the midst of a four-game winning streak, with each of the last three being shootout victories.Meanwhile, an abundance of college basketball games take place on Wednesday, with one being a clash between 13th-ranked Vanderbilt (10-0) and Memphis (4-5) at 7 p.m. ET at the FedExForum. The Tigers had their three-game winning streak snapped by No. 11 Louisville on Saturday but are looking to hand the Commodores their first loss of the season. South Florida is a 3-point favorite against Old Dominion in the latest consensus college football odds, while Louisiana is a 2.5-point favorite versus Delaware. The Timberwolves are 7.5-favorites against the Grizzlies, the Hurricanes are -184 on the money line against the Predators and Vanderbilt is a 9.5-point favorite versus Memphis.Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Wednesday, Dec. 17. All times EasternCFB best bets, where to watchOld Dominion vs. South FloridaTime: 5 p.m. | Location: Orlando, Fla. | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Old Dominion +3 (-114) | Expert: Under 53.5 points (-109, Mike Tierney)All but one of South Florida's nine victories this season were lopsided, as the Bulls won those eight contests by 27 or more points. But they're without starting quarterback Byrum Brown, who became the 12th player in FBS history to pass for 3,000 yards (3,158) and rush for 1,000 (1,008) in the same season, and are running into an Old Dominion squad that is on a five-game winning streak and outscored its last four opponents 136-26. Even though Monarchs QB Colton Joseph also opted out of the game, the SportsLine Projection Model is backing Old Dominion, which wins in 53% of its simulations. SportsLine expert Mike Tierney (5-0 on his last five South Florida over/under picks) believes the combination of backup quarterbacks and solid defenses will result in the Cure Bowl being a low-scoring affair.Louisiana vs. DelawareTime: 8:30 p.m. | Location: Mobile, Ala. | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine pick -- Model: Louisiana -133The teams enter the 68 Ventures Bowl with .500 records, but the Ragin' Cajuns definitely come into the matchup with more momentum. Louisiana ended its regular season with four consecutive victories while Delaware, which is making its first bowl game appearance in 43 years, lost three of its final five contests. Louisiana possesses one of the better ground attacks in the nation as it ranked 29th with an average of 189.8 yards per game, with three players gaining more than 625 yards. Since Delaware is 89th against the run (164.3 yards allowed), the SportsLine Projection Model sees the Ragin' Cajuns running to victory as its simulations have them winning 74% of the time.NBA best bets, where to watchGrizzlies at TimberwolvesTime: 8 p.m. | Location: Minneapolis | TV: NBA TV | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Under 230.5 (-111) | Expert: Jaren Jackson Jr. Under 5.5 rebounds (-147, Mike Barner)The Timberwolves and Grizzlies both rank in the top of the NBA in points allowed, as the former is ninth (114.5) and the latter 12th (115.4). Minnesota is sixth in the league in scoring (119.8 points), but three of their last four games have gone Under the projected total for Wednesday's matchup. Five of Memphis' last seven contests have done the same, and the SportsLine Projection Model sees the trends continuing as the Under hits in more than 56% of its simulations. Grizzlies forward Jaren Jackson Jr. is averaging five rebounds this season and has grabbed fewer than six in six of his last eight outings, leading SportsLine NBA expert Mike Barner (7-4 on his last 11 NBA player prop picks) to think he won't do so against a Timberwolves team that is 11th in fewest boards allowed per game.NHL best bets, where to watchHurricanes at PredatorsTime: 8 p.m. | Location: Nashville | TV: ESPN+ | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Under 6 (-104) | Expert: Predators +1.5 (-166, Matt Severance)Even though they are on a four-game winning streak, the Hurricanes haven't been lighting up the scoreboard. The club has scored three goals or fewer in each of its last three contests and six of its past eight. Nashville has netted at least five tallies twice in its last three outings but ranks 26th in the NHL with an average of 2.81 per game. Taking those things into consideration, the SportsLine Projection Model is calling for a low-scoring contest as its simulations have the Under hitting close to 54% of the time. SportsLine expert Matt Severance (4-1-1, +265 on his last six Carolina against-the-spread picks) agrees and likes the Predators to cover as goaltender Juuse Saros has posted a 2.53 goals-against average and .920 save percentage this month.CBB best bets, where to watchVanderbilt at MemphisTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Memphis | TV: ESPN2 | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Over 158.5 (-112) | Expert: Vanderbilt -7.5 (-108, Bruce Marshall)The Tigers have held their opponents to 42.7% shooting this season, but they'll be hard-pressed to contain Vanderbilt. The Commodores are making 51.6% of their shots and are fifth in the nation with an average of 95.4 points per game. Louisville scored 99 points against Memphis last Saturday, and Vanderbilt has put up 88 or more in eight of its 10 contests this season. The SportsLine Projection Model thinks the Commodores will come close to that number on Wednesday, and the Over hits almost 53% of the time in its simulations. SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall (+459 on his last 15 college basketball picks) expects Vanderbilt to cover the spread behind guard Duke Miles, who is averaging a team-leading 16.6 points in his first season with the school.\n            ",

Sanders recently delivered a 364-yard, three-touchdown against the Tennessee Titans, but Sunday's mistake-filled loss to the Chicago Bears was humbling for the rookie.Sanders gleamed from a previous conversation with Jameis Winston that numbers are meaningless compared to wins and losses.\"I talked to Jameis a couple weeks ago after he threw for some crazy yards, but he said the most important thing is the wins,\" Sanders said. \"Having that guidance and having that knowledge from a vet like him truly helped me understand it a little bit more. I always knew, of course, winning was the final goal. That's what everybody in this league tries to do, so you just got to focus on that.\"Sanders, a fifth-round selection, became the Browns starter for the rest of the season. He is 1-3 as a starter since Dillon Gabriel suffered a concussion in Week 11 against the Baltimore Ravens.\n\"He's a young player that is making progress, like we've talked about all week,\" Browns coach Kevin Stefanski said after his team's loss to the Bears. \"I see it in games. I get to see it in practice. There's going to be ups and downs to young players, particularly the quarterback position. So we'll learn from it, and we'll be better next week.\"Since struggling in his debut, Sanders showed signs of improvement prior to his three-interception performance. He led the Browns to a Nov. 23 win over the Las Vegas Raiders with 209 yards passing and a touchdown. And the aforementioned three-touchdown stat line against the Titans during a 31-29 loss flexed growth.\n\"In every situation, it's always going to be things you want to work on and get better,\" Sanders said after Sunday's loss. \"I think that's where I'm heading. I'm in the learning and understanding phase of his time and how things are.\"\n            \n    ",

All 18 teams participated in the final matchday of the league phase on Wednesday, with simultaneous kickoffs for maximum chaos, and nothing was decided until the final whistle. As the league phase ends, the competition now welcomes the knockout phase playoff, and eight teams will compete for a spot in the future quarterfinals as 12 of the 18 teams that participated in the league phase are still alive. On Thursday, the UWCL knockout phase draw will determine which clubs will battle it out in February for the remaining quarterfinal spots. Here's everything you need to know about what's next:Matchday 6 resultsJuventus 0, Real Madrid 1PSG 1, Benfica 1Roma 6, St. Polten 1Bayern 3, Valerenga 0FC Twente 1, Real Madrid 1OH Leuven 0, Arsenal 3Paris FC 0, Barcelona 2OL Lyonnes 4, Atletico Madrid 0Wolfsburg 1, Chelsea 2StandingsTop four advance to quarterfinals, and spots 5-12 enter the knockout phase playoffs.1.

The pair of Champions League titans head to the quarterfinals, and Wendie Renard provided vintage heroics for Lyonnes.\nThe two sides were only separated by goal differential, with Barcelona claiming first, and OL would have needed seven goals and a result from Paris FC over the Catalonians to top the table. Joining Barcelona and Lyonnes are Chelsea FC and Bayern Munich.Who are the knockout phase teams?ArsenalManchester UnitedJuventusReal MadridWolfsburgParis FCAtletico de MadridOH LeuvenTeams who finished the league phase 5th through 12th will compete in a new knockout phase round. The two-leg fixtures will determine the remainder of the competition, and plenty of attention will be on current title holders Arsenal as the Gunners ended matchday 6 with a big 3-0 victory against OH Leuven. \nJoining them are tournament debutants, Manchester United, and U.S. women's national team goalkeeper Phallon Tulis-Joyce aided her club in 1-0 victory against Juventus. \nWho were eliminated?Several teams were eliminated ahead of matchday 6, with Benfica, Roma, St. Polten, FC Twente, and the biggest disappointment, Paris Saint-Germain. Joining them is the debutant team Valerenga. The Norwegian side were in a position to try an advance but needed a win over Bayern Munich and help with an OH Leuven loss. What's next?The draw will take place on Thursday at 7 a.m. ET on CBS Sports Golazo Network as the competition prepares to close out the calendar year. The teams 5-8 are seeded and those 9-12 are unseeded and will be paired via the draw.\nThe knockout phase for the 2025-26 season begins in February (11-12, 18-19), and quarterfinals in March (24-25) and April (1-2). Following the semifinals in late April and early May, the final two teams will compete for the ultimate title in Oslo, Norway, on May 23 at Ullevaal Stadion.\n            ",

College football bowl season provides an opportunity for fan bases to see their team one last time and get a sneak peek into the future as younger players get into the game. The bowl schedule kicked off Saturday, Dec. 13 and goes all the way until Jan. 2. The College Football Playoff carries us from there to Jan. 19, when two teams will vie for a national championship in Miami Gardens, Florida. CBS will once again broadcast the Tony the Tiger Sun Bowl. Kick is set for 2 p.m. on Dec. 31 in El Paso, Texas. Additionally, Dec. 27 is one of the most stacked days of the year as eight bowl games will take place on that day, including the Pop-Tarts Bowl, Texas Bowl and Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl Presented By Gin & Juice By Dre and Snoop (yes, that's its official name). \n\n        \n            \n                College Football Playoff bracket: Indiana, Ohio State, Georgia, Texas Tech earn byes; Miami in over Notre Dame\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBelow is a detailed look at the complete schedule for the 2025-26 college football bowl season, including dates, locations and TV channels.

Los Angeles also boasts a 4-2 straight-up record at Seattle over the last six meetings, which includes a postseason contest. L.A. has the league's best offense, topping the NFL in both points and yards, as well as yards per play. It's also a team that doesn't beat itself, as Sean McVay's crew committed the fewest penalties in the regular season, and only three teams had fewer turnovers. The defense is also elite in several areas, including allowing the fewest rushing touchdowns in 2025, having the fourth-best pressure rate and notching the fifth-most takeaways. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Seahawks can coverNo team has a better spread record than Seattle, which has gone 13-5 versus the line over the regular plus postseason. The Seahawks are riding an eight-game outright win streak, with the last three of those all coming by double-digits against NFC playoff teams. Also, one can't discount that Seattle is coming off a Saturday game, with the Rams playing a Sunday overtime game, and the former boasts a 5-1 ATS record with a rest edge. On the field, the Seahawks' defense is the best unit in all of football, ranking first in points allowed, allowing the fewest yards per rush and giving up the fewest yards per pass. That overshadows the fact they also have the No. 3 scoring offense, and it's one which is coming off its second-most points (41) in franchise postseason history. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Rams vs. Seahawks    picksSportsLine's model has simulated Seahawks vs. Rams 10,000 times and is going Under on the total, projecting 46 combined points. It also says one side of the spread hits in nearly 60% of simulations in an A-rated pick. You can only get the pick at SportsLine. So who wins Rams vs. Seahawks, and which side of the spread hits nearly 60% of the time in an A-rated pick?

    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL playoffs are down to four teams, with both conference championship games taking place on Sunday. Both No. 1 seeds will host, though one is a favorite and one is an underdog, per the Championship Round NFL odds via DraftKings Sportsbook. Seattle is giving 2.5 points to the Rams in the NFC title game at 6:30 p.m. ET, and the Seahawks have made the Super Bowl in each of its three previous times being a top seed. However, the first Super Bowl participant will come from the AFC title game at 3 p.m. ET, and the top-seeded Broncos are now 3.5-point home underdogs to utilize in NFL picks after opening at -5.5.Of course, Bo Nix (ankle) being done for the year has much to do with that NFL spread as Denver's new starting quarterback, Jarrett Stidham, hasn't thrown a pass in two years. Thus, there is a lot to consider before making any NFL playoffs bets for the title games. All of the updated Championship Round   NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Championship Round   NFL picks now.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters the AFC and NFC Championship Games on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now, it has turned its attention to the latest Championship Round NFL odds and NFL betting lines and locked in betting picks for every NFL matchup. Head here to see every pick. Top Championship Round   NFL predictionsOne of the model's strongest Championship Round   NFL picks is the Under (42.5) hits in Patriots vs. Broncos at 3 p.m. ET. Denver has been an underdog five times this season, and the Under has hit in four of those games. Meanwhile, the Pats have failed to reach the total in four of their last six games as an away favorite. With Nix out, the Broncos' offense will take a step back, but Sean Payton will also adjust his game plan and run the ball more to eat up the clock. For the Pats, Maye has looked shaky during the postseason with six total fumbles (three lost), two interceptions and getting sacked 10 times across two games. Thus, many New England drives end up in kicks, or turnovers, which prevents the scoring running up. The model has the teams combining for 40 points as the Under hits in well over 50% of simulations. See which other teams to pick here, and bet the Under (-105) using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nHow to make Championship Round   NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in both games of the Championship Round   NFL schedule, and it has two A-rated picks, including one versus the spread. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine.So what NFL Championship Round picks can you make with confidence, and which A-rated picks should you lock in now?

Those who've made NFL picks against the spread all year are probably aware that New England and Seattle each have a league-high of 13 spread wins this season. The Rams (12) are just behind them, but with Denver having just eight ATS victories, the Broncos could be ones to fade with Championship Round NFL predictions.While that may have you leaning towards one side in the AFC title game, what should you make of the NFC Championship Game with your NFL bets? They split their two regular season matchups both versus the line and outright, with the Rams winning the first by two points and the Seahawks winning the second by one point.

WhiteWhite, CBS Sports' managing editor of Fantasy and gambling, is 21-15-1 (+445) on his last 37 over/under picks. For Patriots vs. Broncos, he is backing Under 42.5.\"The Patriots defense has run roughshod over a pair of offenses with major injury concerns the last two weeks, and they'll get another with Jarrett Stidham at QB. Playcaller Zak Kuhr is in his bag, completely outmaneuvering the Chargers and Texans, and Stidham faces an uphill battle to score points. Drake Maye's offense has struggled with turnovers against two top-tier defenses and gets another here, and the margin between the Broncos and second place in sacks was more than the gap between No. 2 and 9.

He enters this weekend on a 61-44 roll on NFL player props that has returned nearly $1,000 for $100 players. This week, PropStarz is going Over 17.5 receiving yards for Seahawks running back Kenneth Walker III.\"Kenneth Walker has cleared this line in seven of eleven games since the Seahawks Week 9 bye. This, of course, is despite an almost 50/50 route share split with Zach Charbonnet. With the latter back out for the season, I expect Walker to take on a bigger role, which should include more pass plays. It's a great matchup for him, as the Rams allowed the fifth most receiving yards to running backs in the regular season (38 yards per game), with an opposing back clearing this line in nine of their last eleven games. This includes Walker's 64-yard and 44-yard performances (Charbonnet with six total targets and 32 yards as well).

    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL Championship Round takes place on Sunday as the Broncos host the New England Patriots (-3.5, 42.5) at 3 p.m. ET and the Seahawks host the Rams (+2.5, 46.5) at 6:30 p.m. ET. While one could pursue standard NFL bets like the spread and total with a Championship Round NFL parlay, you could also take a chance on plus-money predictions. Wagers like alternate lines, exact score predictions and NFL props often have huge returns, and stringing them together within a single bet could be an NFL longshot parlay worth pursuing.The Pats have won four straight games by double digits and now get to face a backup quarterback in Jarrett Stidham who hasn't thrown a pass in two years. If you expect another huge Pats victory, then you could back New England on an alternate spread as Patriots -13.5 has +242 odds at DraftKings Sportsbook. This could be a standalone bet or as part of an NFL longshot parlay prediction. Before making any Championship Round NFL picks or parlays, you need to see the Championship Round NFL longshot parlay from SportsLine's proven computer simulation that pays out $1.1 million on a $10 bet.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

Denver's 68 sacks led the NFL in the regular season and were just four shy of matching the all-time NFL record. Allen is the only member of this elite Broncos defense to be a First-Team All-Pro as the lineman had 7.0 sacks and lived in the offensive backfield. His 47 QB hits led all NFL players, even topping Myles Garrett, who set the single-season sack record.New England has allowed five sacks in back-to-back games, and just three quarterbacks were sacked more often than Drake Maye (47) in the regular season. Allen has at least 0.5 sacks in his last two playoff games, and this season he has three times as many sacks playing at home than in road stadiums. The Broncos are projected to have 4.42 sacks on Sunday, making this an NFL prop with great value to back. See the rest of the picks in the Championship Round NFL parlay here, and you can bet Allen to record at least half a sack using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nHow to make NFL parlay picks for a payout of $1.1 millionThe parlay also includes six additional picks from the Championship Round from SportsLine's computer model, including multiple touchdown props that return higher than +400. You can only see the picks and the full parlay at SportsLine.What are the top NFL picks for the Championship Round that can be combined into a parlay that returns $1.1 million on just a $10 bet, and what optimal touchdown scorer bets should you be all over?

Umanmielen played last season for Kiffin at Ole Miss.Seaton, a former five-star recruit in the 2024 recruiting cycle by 247Sports, committed to coach Deion Sanders out of high school. During his freshman campaign, Seaton started all 13 games and became the first offensive tackle to start in a season-opener at the school.\n\nAs a sophomore, Seaton appeared in nine games during the 2025 season but missed the final three due to injury. He earned All-Big 12 Second Team honors for his efforts.\nLSU under Kiffin holds the No. 1 overall transfer class in the 247Sports rankings. Ironically, Ole Miss -- Kiffin's former employer -- holds the second-ranked recruiting class heading into the final week of January.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        LAS VEGAS -- The Zuffa Boxing era kicks off on Friday night with Zuffa Boxing 01, a card headlined by a middleweight bout between Callum Walsh and Carlos Ocampo. The event is the first in TKO's foray into boxing and will stream live on Paramount+ from the Meta Apex in Las Vegas.Walsh (15-0, 11 KO) is undefeated as a professional and has steadily worked his way up in level of competition. In his most recent outing, Walsh picked up the biggest win of his career, scoring a decision win over undefeated Fernando Vargas on the undercard of Terence Crawford's vs. Saul \"Canelo\" Alvarez this past September, which was co-promoted by Zuffa Boxing.Sign up for Paramount+ and watch Zuffa Boxing 01 live on Friday night for no additional fee. UFC 324 on Saturday -- plus every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night -- is included with the price of your subscription! Plans start as low as $8.99/month or $89.99/year!Walsh has long been close with UFC president and CEO Dana White, who has helped guide Walsh's career. This made Walsh a no-brainer as the first marquee signee for Zuffa Boxing.\n\"You know, I think it makes sense,\" Walsh told CBS Sports of being selected for such a prestigious spot. \"I've been around Dana, I've been around boxing for a while. I've been proving myself in the ring. I've been getting the wins. I've just had a big win in my last fight, and just the fact that I've been around Dana so long, you know, pushing him to get involved in boxing. I've proved that I will fight anybody and that I'm really bringing the same mindset as the UFC to boxing. So, I think it's only right to be the first main event and be given an opportunity to prove myself and to prove to everyone that's really what I'm about.\"White, when asked about the event and promoting Walsh, made sure to note that he's here for all the fighters, not just Walsh.\"Every time that I do something, I build a team around me that's extraordinary. This is what the matchmakers for boxing came up with,\" White told CBS Sports on Wednesday. \"We believe that this is a strong card. Obviously, Callum is a kid that I've supported for a long time. People thought that I was his manager ... I've never made a dollar off Callum. I've just liked him from the time I met him and I've backed him, and here we are today. Just because I've had a relationship with this kid and he's in this position ... I don't determine who wins the fights.\"  \nIn Ocampo (38-3, 26 KO), Walsh faces a fighter with several high-level fights, though he has come up short in all of his biggest outings.Ocampo fought for the IBF welterweight title in 2018, losing by first-round stoppage. He then fought twice for interim junior middleweight titles, losing a decision to Sebastian Fundora and by first-round knockout to Tim Tszyu in 2022 and 2023, respectively.Aside from those moments where Ocampo faced fighters who rate among the best of the best in the game, he has been perfect and is frequently runs through his opposition. Since the loss to Tszyu, Ocampo has rattled off three consecutive stoppage victories, though against opposition well below Walsh's level.\nStill, Walsh believes Ocampo's experience makes him a dangerous opponent.\"I'm expecting an all-action fight, you know,\" Walsh said. \"I'm expecting a real fight. You know, this is a real opponent. This is a real test for me to prove myself. He's been in there with big names. He has a lot of experience, and if I can beat him, if I can get him out of there, then I'll prove that I am up there with the best of him.\"Friday's main card also features a middleweight bout between undefeated fighters Misael Rodriguez and Austin Deanda and opens with a junior welterweight bout between Cain Sandoval and Julian Rodriguez.Sandoval vs. Rodriguez stands out as an excellent kickoff to the first Zuffa Boxing main card. The undefeated Sandoval is getting a big opportunity, but has shown big knockout power throughout his career. Rodriguez is coming off a 10th-round knockout of Avious Griffin, the highly-touted Most Valuable Promotions prospect, on the undercard of Jake Paul's bout with Julio Cesar Chavez Jr.\nElsewhere on the card, Omar Trinidad takes on Max Ornelas at featherweight, Floyd Diaz returns to face off against Guillermo Gutierrez at bantamweight and Emiliano Cardenas takes on Marcus Harris also at bantamweight.Let's take a closer look at the rest of the card set for Friday with the latest odds before getting to a prediction and expert pick on the main event below.Zuffa Boxing 01 fight card, oddsOdds via DraftKings SportsbookCallum Walsh -700 vs. Carlos Ocampo +450, middleweightsMisael Rodriguez -700 vs. Austin Deanda +450, middleweightsCain Sandoval -230 vs. Julian Rodriguez +180, junior welterweightsOmar Trinidad -265 vs. Max Ornelas +205, featherweightsFloyd Diaz -1100 vs. Guillermo Gutierrez +600, bantamweightsEmiliano Cardenas -1100 vs. Marcus Harris +600, bantamweightsRobert Meriwether III -3000 vs. Cesar Correa +1000, junior lightweightsTroy Nash -1600 vs. Jaycob Ramos +750, featherweightsPredictionsOcampo is a fine fighter, but he's someone who has built a career where he is seen as an opponent more than a contender. That said, Ocampo brings the fight to his opponents, and Walsh has an opportunity to deliver a result that will be directly compared to Ocampo's results against Spence, Fundora and Tszyu.\nOcampo leaves himself open to be hit, and Walsh has good pop. There is one interesting angle here, which is Walsh moving up from fighting at junior middleweight (154 pounds) to middleweight (160) for this fight. Sometimes, fighters see a dropoff in their punching power as they move up in weight; other times, they have more power because they aren't affected by cutting extra weight.Expect Walsh to find the stoppage in this one, but how quickly he gets there and how he looks doing it will be intriguing things to follow. Pick: Callum Walsh via TKO3\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The second leg of a Saturday tripleheader on CBS will feature a matchup between No. 1 Arizona and West Virginia. The Wildcats head into the weekend as one of three teams in Division I basketball that have yet to suffer a loss. The Wildcats have held the top spot in the AP Top 25 poll for seven consecutive weeks. Arizona is coming off a 77-51 win over Cincinnati to improve to 19-0 overall and 6-0 in Big 12 play. Arizona and Houston (5-0) are the only teams in the conference that have yet to suffer a loss. The Wildcats only face the Cougars once this season (Feb. 21) on the road. West Virginia improved to 13-6 with a 75-63 win over Arizona State. The Mountaineers have won four of their last five games, which includes a win at home over Kansas. This weekend will mark the fourth Top 25 opponent WVU has played this season. West Virginia is 1-2 thus far, with losses coming against Iowa State and Houston. Here is everything you need to know ahead of the Big 12 showdown.   Where to watch Arizona vs. West Virginia live   Date: Saturday, Jan. 24 | Time: 2 p.m. ET Location: McKale Memorial Center -- Tucson, Arizona \nTV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App Streaming on Paramount+ Premium      Arizona vs. West Virginia: Need to know Arizona's dynamic duo: The Wildcats have the luxury of having not one, but two of the best first-year players in the sport. That would be Koa Peat and Brayden Burries. Peat has one of the best debuts in college basketball history against reigning national champion Florida earlier this season when he scored 30 points. Peat has started all 19 games for the Wildcats. As for Burries, he has played well the last two months after a slow start. He is averaging 14.2 points and 4.4 rebounds and has been a major reason why the Wildcats still have yet to suffer a loss. His best showing came against Kansas State earlier this month when he finished with 28 points and nine rebounds. Big opportunity for WVU: The Mountaineers have a chance to shake up college basketball this weekend with a win. However, recent history suggests WVU hasn't performed well against ranked teams. WVU has lost five consecutive games (including 16 of 17) on the road against a ranked opponent. The last win against a ranked team on the road came against Kansas on Dec. 31, 2024. The Mountaineers are 1-6 away from home and are averaging just 67.3 points per game in that stretch. \nArizona coach Tommy Lloyd has fueled a historic start: Arizona is on the verge of its best start to the season in 12 years. During the 2013-14 campaign, the Wildcats got off to a 21-0 start. Currently, Arizona is riding a 19-game win streak, which is the third-longest active streak in the sport. With a win this weekend, Arizona can clinch another 20-win season under Lloyd. That would mark the fifth consecutive 20-win season under his watch. No other Arizona coach has started his tenure with more seasons with at least 20 wins. Of course, the Wildcats have much loftier goals, but Lloyd has been one of the best and most consistent coaches in the sport since arriving from Gonzaga.  Arizona vs. West Virginia prediction, picks \nWest Virginia has played well since the calendar flipped to 2026. Outside of losing to Iowa State and Houston -- two of the best teams in the nation -- WVU has shown improvement. I think the Mountaineers keep this game within 10 in the second half and cover the spread. If WVU can slow down Arizona's lethal offense that ranks No. 7 in scoring (89.9 points per game), it will have a chance to make it interesting. Pick: West Virginia +17.5 \t \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            ARIZ -17.5\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            West Virginia\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            West Virginia\n                    \n    \n    STRAIGHT-UP\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    Who will win and cover in every college basketball game? Visit SportsLine to get picks from the model that simulates each game 10,000 times and is up more than $1,200 for $100 players on its top-rated spread picks the past six years.  \n            ",

    "body": "\nA trip to Super Bowl LX will be on the line Sunday with both the AFC and NFC Championship Games. In the AFC, Drake Maye and the New England Patriots take on backup quarterback Jarrett Stidham and the Denver Broncos, after Bo Nix had his season come to an end with an ankle injury. In the NFC, Matthew Stafford and the Los Angeles Rams will battle Sam Darnold and the Seattle Seahawks. New England enters the AFC title game as a 3.5-point favorite at DraftKings Sportsbook after opening as 5.5-point favorites. Seattle, meanwhile, is a 2.5-point home favorite for the NFC Championship, with the total at 46.5. The Seahawks won't have running back Zach Charbonnet (knee) for the rest of the NFL playoffs. Denver and New England are the top two seeds in the AFC, and the Broncos are tied for being the biggest home underdog in conference championship game history.

    "body": "\n        \r\n\tSan Diego State will be looking to get back on track Saturday, when it travels to UNLV for a clash between a pair of the Mountain West's top teams on CBS. The Aztecs (15-5, 7-1) remain alone atop the conference standings after falling at Grand Canyon on Wednesday, but the loss inflicted some damage to the Aztecs' at-large aspirations for the NCAA Tournament. \r\n\r\n\r\nBeating the Runnin' Rebels (10-8, 5-2) would help get the repair started. UNLV enters on a three-game winning streak that includes a massive 86-76 win over Utah State on Tuesday night. That was a head-turning result in the Mountain West which proved once again just how dangerous UNLV is under first-year coach Josh Pastner. \r\n\r\n\n        \n            \n                Bracketology: No. 2 seeds Houston, UConn, Purdue, Iowa State ready to move up if teams on top line go down\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\r\nWhile his debut campaign has featured a few bad losses, the Rebels also own victories over Memphis and Stanford. UNLV atones for being one of the nation's worst 3-point shooting teams by relentlessly attacking the basket and shooting 26.6 free throws per game, which ranks No. 13 nationally. \r\n\r\n\r\nSan Diego State counters with its vintage strong defense and a balanced offensive attack. Looming large for SDSU is uncertainty around the status of center Magoon Gwath. The seven-footer missed the Grand Canyon amid a hip issue, and his status will be a key issue for the Aztecs both in this game and beyond. \r\n\n\r\n  Where to watch San Diego State vs. UNLV live   \r\n\r\n\r\n\tDate: Saturday, January 24 | Time: 4 p.m. ET\r\n Location: Thomas & Mack Center -- Las Vegas\r\n TV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App \r\n\n\tStreaming on Paramount+ PremiumLive stream: fubo (Try for free)\r\n\r\n San Diego State vs. UNLV: Need to know \r\n\r\n\r\n\tInside the arc: If you're a fan of the 3-pointer, this isn't the game for you. UNLV and San Diego State rank 285th and 310th, respectively, in 3-point attempts per game. The Runnin' Rebels make just 31.4% of their attempts and have hit more than 10 in a game just once this season. SDSU makes a highly respectable 36.7% of its 3-pointers but is coming off a 3 for 18 performance from deep in Wednesday's loss at Grand Canyon. \r\n\r\n\r\n\tMountain West menace: UNLV guard Dra Gibbs-Lawhorn is emerging as one of the Mountain West's most potent scorers. The Illinois transfer finished with 21 points on 8 of 12 shooting in the Runnin' Rebels' 86-76 win at Utah State on Tuesday. That followed a 33-point outburst in a win over Boise State on Jan. 13. Against league foes he is averaging 18.1 points, and he's reached double figures in all but one game this season. Gibbs-Lawhorn has some variety in his arsenal as he inflicts damage as both a spot-up shooter and ball-handler. At just 6-foot-1, he's also been solid at the rim. \r\n\n\r\n\tSan Diego State's resume: San Diego State enters on the wrong side of the NCAA Tournament bubble in CBS Sports Bracketology and is expected to stay there even with a win. However, our long-term forecast projects the Aztecs to ultimately make the bracket as a No. 11 seed. For now, SDSU's resume is a bit chaotic and dragged down by a Quad 3 November home loss to Troy. While the Aztecs do own a Quad 1 road win over Nevada from Jan. 6, they'll need to add more in order to finish on the right side of the bubble. The most significant opportunities still ahead are road games against Utah State (Jan. 31) and New Mexico (Feb. 28).  \r\n\r\n\r\n San Diego State vs. UNLV prediction, picks \r\n\n\r\nSan Diego State plays a style of defense designed to tempt you into shooting 3-pointers. That could be a problem for UNLV, which does not take or make many shots from beyond the arc. The Runnin' Rebels prefer to attack, get fouled and shoot free throws. Provided the Aztecs make enough shots of their own and prevent UNLV from running in transition, they should be able to dictate the game's flow on the defensive end. SDSU is also going to be motivated to seek redemption following a deflating 1-point loss at Grand Canyon on Wednesday night that ended its perfect start to Mountain West play. Pick: San Diego State -5.5\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\nSDSU -5.5\r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            UNLV\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            San Diego St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            San Diego St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            UNLV\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            San Diego St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            San Diego St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nSTRAIGHT-UP\r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            San Diego St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            San Diego St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            San Diego St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            San Diego St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            San Diego St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            San Diego St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\tWho will win and cover in every college basketball game? Visit SportsLine to get picks from the model that simulates each game 10,000 times and is up more than $1,200 for $100 players on its top-rated spread picks the past six years.  \r\n\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Arsenal are seven points clear at the top of the Premier League table. With a game left to play before the Champions League knockout phase they are guaranteed the most favourable fixture scheduling UEFA can provide. They are garlanded with praise, heralded the \"best team in the world\" by those who hope to hunt them down.You could cut the tension with a knife.Anyone who didn't see the score line from Saturday's visit to Nottingham Forest but did see the social media reaction could have been forgiven for thinking that Mikel Arteta's side had turned a commanding lead into a heavy defeat, had inflicted a string of injuries upon themselves, maybe even taken to the pitch carrying a banner saying \"this Premier League lark isn't for us\". Harness the energy unleashed by frustrated supporters after the 0-0 draw at the City Ground and the dream of clean, free energy for all would be a reality. And yet, the stats tell quite a different story.Now there is an easy and obvious rejoinder to this. Social media is not a place for moderate, restrained analysis at the best of times and Gabriel Martinelli turning wide from a few yards out was one of them. This is the internet. It's not real life. And as if that isn't disproven by a million and one other things, it's quite clear that the little pocket of the internet marked Arsenal's is bleeding into real life. Anyone who has been at the Emirates Stadium this season will have sensed a tension that would be shared with the fanbases of few if any other prohibitive title contenders.It is almost as if a fanbase has been thrust, en masse, into the last few pages of Nick Hornby's Fever Pitch. Just as they had come to terms with the idea that Arsenal might be locked out of title contention for even more than the 21 years they've waited since the Invincibles, Arteta has inducted them into the \"Church of the Latterday Championship Believers.\" And they have been living the agony of the 1988-89 season -- when Arsenal had the league, threw it away and won it back in the greatest title denouement England has ever seen -- since about Christmas 2022. That's three seasons left \"nakedly exposed when [they] could have remained hard and cynical.\"\nNo wonder it has got a bit cold at the Emirates, where moments of glory fade faster in the face of the crushing fear of disappointment. No one should have been cheering a 2-1 win over Wolves to the rafters, but there is no obligation to celebrate any less when you get a last minute winner in a title race. And yet it barely took a moment after Yerson Mosquera flicked into his own net for the jubilation to turn into recriminations, the sense of a victory that turned into a loss. Saturday's visit to the City Ground was neither, but after Manchester City's defeat earlier in the day it added another point to Arsenal's lead, one that Villa failed to chip into either. Declan Rice though was caught on camera bemoaning \"f---ing shit, every f---ing time.\" If the nerves can move from online to offline, why wouldn't you expect young professionals to allow the same thinking to slip into their headspace?It's not even clear what Rice was referring to. What are those games that make up every time? Arsenal have dropped points in seven of 22 league games this season. Five of those occasions have been in matches against last season's top six. Drawing at home to Liverpool or losing at the death to Aston Villa are disappointing but hardly crises. Probably the two most disappointing results of the season so far have been draws under the lights away to Sunderland and Nottingham Forest. If those are bad results, well then there is no need to be upset.\nFor his part, Arteta seems to have concluded that he cannot sway the emotions of the fanbase. All he can control is what is going on at London Colney. \"I don't think anybody has more motivation, hunger and desire for us to go all the way and win it,\" he said.\"We know the only way to do it is focusing, being very present in the moment and doing everything that we have to do today to be better than tomorrow. That's it. That's the only thing that we can control. The rest is just things that don't add any value to us and can take the focus to the wrong place.\"Bundled into the rest, perhaps we can place any ambitions Arteta might have about swaying the crowd. Since the day he was appointed over six years ago, the Spaniard has gone to great lengths to engage supporters, to turn the remnants of the Highbury Library into Fortress Emirates. It is to his credit that it tends to work in the big games and while tension has been rife in the air when Wolves and Brentford have come to town, the crowd has raised itself for the big games. Arteta will want many things when Manchester United roll into town on Sunday afternoon. He will not want the Emirates Stadium becalmed.\n\"It is not about calming,\" he said of his message to supporters. \"It is about continuing to do what we are doing really well and try to evolve every single day to be better. From their side it is to continue doing what they do in the stadium. Create more energy, more positiveness around the games in each section. If we do that and we create that kind of a scenario, we are going to make it more and more difficult to the opponent and that is going to help us to win more games.\"They should expect to keep on winning. Perhaps Pep Guardiola's labelling Arsenal \"the best team in the world\" is an attempt at the sort of mind games that Sir Alex Ferguson might have deployed when he and Arsene Wenger were vying for Premier League supremacy. Then again, there's a reason what he said did not lead news bulletins and (probably) back pages is in itself constructive. Of course that's what Arsenal are. Did you see what they did to Bayern Munich and Inter?Arteta brushed off such lofty tags -- \"we are the team who wants to be perfect\" -- but Guardiola's words explain why the title race is viewed as so one-sided by those who don't have skin in the game. Opta's projection model gives Arsenal a 93% chance of winning the Premier League title. Bookmakers are a bit less bullish but odds that imply an 85% chance are a pretty ringing endorsement. There's that fear again. How humiliating might it be to fritter away a lead like that?\nAll the more so given that the rivals are not what they were. Arteta is not writing off Manchester City but his explanation as to why is probably more indicative than he would like. \"You have to go back to the history of that club in the last 10 years and what they are capable of doing,\" he said. That's the thing though. The past decade of City history is defined by Ilkay Gundogan, Kevin De Bruyne, Sergio Aguero. They're not walking through the dressing room door at the Etihad.It is all in Arsenal's hands. Even the injuries that derailed their title challenge have eased for the time being at least. Riccardo Calafiori and Piero Hincapie were back in training on Friday, the only player missing from the first team is 16 year old Max Dowman. There is no injury crisis like last year to hand the league to Liverpool. There is no City of two years ago. There is just Arsenal and the fear of what might go wrong.As Arteta said, \"we know what we are capable of doing to win this Premier League.\" His fans do too. That's where the fear comes from. The same two decades of longing that haunted Hornby are bedeviling a new generation. He put it best, \"what else is there that can reasonably be coveted for that long?\" Now that it is so close Arsenal could almost reach out and touch it, can you blame anyone who fears it might slip away again.\n            ",

The AFC and NFC Championship Games take place Sunday afternoon and evening, with the winners of those matchups heading to Santa Clara with the opportunity to win the Lombardi Trophy. The Denver Broncos host the AFC title game against the New England Patriots, while the Los Angeles Rams and Seattle Seahawks face off for the third time this season for the NFC championship. Oftentimes, the teams that are healthiest entering and throughout the postseason have the most success, and that's largely been the case this year. However, one major injury shook up the NFL world last weekend and will have a major impact on how things play out this week. With the two conference title games on tap, here are the top injuries bettors need to know for Sunday. Additionally, we'll look at where NFL betting odds stand at DraftKings Sportsbook. New England Patriots at Denver Broncos (3 p.m. ET)DEN QB Bo Nix (ankle, out for season)DEN WR Troy Franklin (hamstring, questionable)\nNo injury has more of an impact on betting lines this weekend than Bo Nix. Nix, Denver's starting quarterback, broke a bone in his ankle late in Denver's overtime win over Buffalo last week. He's out for the rest of the postseason after needing surgery, and the Broncos now turn to backup Jarrett Stidham under center. Stidham hasn't started a game since Week 18 of the 2023 season, and he notably was drafted by Denver's opponent, the Patriots, back in 2019. Second-year standout receiver Troy Franklin is also questionable with a hamstring injury. The Patriots are favored by 4.5 points on the road due in large part to the Nix injury. The total is 42.5.Los Angeles Rams at Seattle Seahawks (6:30 p.m. ET)SEA QB Sam Darnold (oblique, will play)SEA RB Zach Charbonnet (ACL, out for season)\nThe Seahawks got a bit of a scare at practice last week when Sam Darnold suffered an oblique injury that resulted in a questionable game status, but the veteran quarterback played as Seattle blew out the 49ers. That blowout likely helped keep Darnold healthier, as the Seahawks leaned on the run game while Darnold sat out most of the fourth quarter with the game out of reach. Darnold and the Seahawks won't have one of their top playmakers on offense, however, as Zach Charbonnet tore his ACL last week. He's been Seattle's go-to guy in the red zone, leading the team with 12 rushing scores. More focus will be on Kenneth Walker III to carry the load in the run game, and the team activated second-year back George Holani from injured reserve on Friday to serve as the No. 2 back behind Walker on Sunday. Seattle is a 2.5-point favorite at home. The total is 46.5.\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                                            ",

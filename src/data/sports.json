    "body": "\n        The Miami Dolphins (1-6) and the Atlanta Falcons (3-3) will both look to get back into the win column when they face off in NFL Week 8 on Paramount+. The dysfunction continues for the Dolphins, who have lost three straight games following a 31-6 defeat at the hands of the Cleveland Browns. The Falcons were also put in the loss column in Week 7, falling 20-10 to the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday Night Football. The Falcons are expected to turn to veteran quarterback Kirk Cousins on Sunday with Michael Penix Jr. expected to be sidelined with a knee injury. Kickoff from Mercedes-Benz Stadium is set for 1 p.m. ET on CBS and Paramount+. Atlanta is a 7-point favorite in the latest Dolphins vs. Falcons odds from SportsLine consensus, while the over/under for total points scored is 44.5, down one from the opening line.

Their solo victory this season was a six-point win against the 0-7 Jets. The passing game has shriveled up since Tyreek Hill's season-ending injury, and its only generating 186.6 yards per game while the run game can only muster up 92.4 yards per outing. Miami's defense is also giving up a league-high 159.3 rushing yards per game, so the Dolphins are expected to have a hard time containing Bijan Robinson.  The Falcons' running back was held to just 40 yards on 14 carries and no rushing touchdowns by San Francisco, but Sunday's home game against Miami sets the stage for him to have a revenge performance. The defense still allows the fewest passing yards in the NFL (141.2) and was firing on all cylinders when it held 49ers quarterback Mac Jones without a touchdown.Click here to bet Dolphins vs. Falcons at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if their first bet of at least $5 wins:Model's Dolphins vs. Falcons score prediction, picksBoth teams have covered the spread three times this season.

    "body": "\n        The Buffalo Bills are fresh off a bye week and are looking to get back on track after dropping each of their last two games, and they face a hot Carolina Panthers team that's won three in a row and is a perfect 3-0 at home this year. The Carolina offense has done well of late, but the team faces a Bills side with reigning MVP Josh Allen that's surely angry after falling to 4-2 after a perfect 4-0 start. Kickoff from Bank of America Stadium is set for 1 p.m. ET, and the Bills are 7-point favorites, according to the latest Bills vs. Panthers odds. The over/under for total points scored is 47. The Bills are -408 money line favorites (risk $408 to win $100), while the Panthers are +314 underdogs.

Buffalo scored just 34 points over its two losses before the bye, so Allen will certainly be tasked with doing more to put more points on the board. It's been a while since the vibes were this high for the Panthers, who have won three games in a row and are undefeated at home. Rico Dowdle has given the team a nice boost offensively with well over 400 total yards the last three weeks, and rookie wide receiver Teteiroa McMillan has been making plays, securing two touchdown receptions in his last home game.Click here to bet Bills vs. Panthers at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if their first bet of at least $5 wins:Model's Panthers vs. Bills score prediction, picksBuffalo is just 2-4 against the spread this year, while Carolina is 5-2.

    "body": "\n        The World Series is now a best-of-five. Thanks to Yoshinobu Yamamoto's masterful performance in Game 2, the Los Angeles Dodgers pulled even with the Toronto Blue Jays in this year's Fall Classic. It's a 1-1 series that now heads to Dodger Stadium for Games 3-5. If it goes to Game 6 or 7, the World Series and the 2025 season will conclude at Rogers Centre.   \"I think that the baseball fan, they probably appreciate that. You have to appreciate a complete game,\" Blue Jays manager John Schneider said after Game 2 about Yamamoto's outing. \"So you never know.  You never  know when someone's going to have it.  Every game is different.  So you  never really discount anything.  Who knows what's going to happen on  Game 3? It's baseball and you got to kind of react in real time.\"   Even with the Game 2 loss at home, history is on Toronto's side. Teams that split the first two games at home have still gone on to win a best-of-seven series more than half the time.   \nThis is the fifth time in the last six years the World Series has been tied 1-1 after two games. Last year, when the Dodgers had a 2-0 lead en route to a five-game series win over the New York Yankees, is the only exception. Within the next week either the Dodgers will become the first team to repeat as World Series champs since the 1998-2000 Yankees or the Blue Jays will win their first World Series since their back-to-back titles in 1992 and 1993. One way or the other, a long drought will end.\nHere now are three X-factors for the rest of the series as the Blue Jays and Dodgers travel Sunday ahead of Game 3 on Monday.     Los Angeles Dodgers   Capitalize on the pitching mismatches   On paper, Games 3 and 4 are advantage Dodgers. It'll be Tyler Glasnow vs. Max Scherzer in Game 3 and Shohei Ohtani vs. Shane Bieber in Game 4. Scherzer, despite pitching well in his ALCS start, stumbled badly to the finish line during the regular season, pitching to a 9.00 ERA in his final six starts. The patient Dodgers are unlikely to chase his curveball, a pitch Scherzer surprisingly used more than just about any start in his career in the ALCS, the way the Seattle Mariners did last week.   Bieber sandwiched a strong ALCS Game 3 start between two short, hard-contact-filled starts in the ALDS and ALCS Game 7. He looks like what he is: a pitcher with 10 starts under his belt post-Tommy John surgery. The command isn't always there, the sharp breaking stuff isn't always there, etc. Bieber has made it work more often than not in those 10 starts because he's very talented and very smart, but this postseason has shown his performance can be volatile. He's not the consistent Cy Young version of himself yet.   \nFor sure, Scherzer and Bieber are capable of spinning gems in Games 3 and 4. The pitching matchups do appear to favor the Dodgers these next two games though, and that's their path to winning the World Series. Ride this powerhouse rotation as long as possible because the bullpen is shaky (especially the middle relief) and the offense has not yet fully clicked this October. There is more to life than pitching matchups, but you'd rather have them in your favor than not, and the Dodgers have them.Get the bottom of the lineup going   Despite the Hall of Fame talent atop the lineup, generating offense has not been especially easy for the Dodgers this postseason. They're hitting .216/.307/.359 as a team since the start of the NLDS and they've averaged only 3.7 runs in those 10 games. The offense is doing just enough right now. The starting pitching has been so good and it's had to be. It's remarkable, really, that the Dodgers are three wins away from a second straight championship even though they're not firing on all cylinders.  The bottom of the order -- usually Enrique Hernández, Tommy Edman, and Andy Pages -- has largely been a non-factor. In the 10 games since the start of the NLDS, L.A.'s 7-8-9 hitters have hit .214/.308/.291, and that .308 on-base percentage is boosted by four hit-by-pitches. Pages has struggled so much (4 for 43 with 11 strikeouts) that Dodgers manager Dave Roberts hinted at a possible lineup change. Edman is nursing an ankle injury that limits his running, meaning Alex Call would likely replace Pages in center.   \nToronto's 7-8-9 hitters lead all postseason teams in batting average and slugging percentage since the start of the Division Series round. Their offense is so dangerous and one reason is the bottom of the order is not a pushover, and is instead doing good work setting the table for the top of the lineup. The Dodgers have not had that dynamic. They need more from Edman, Pages, et al to set the table for Ohtani & Co. Simply put, the Dodgers need more offense, and the 7-8-9 hitters are a place to get it.   Take advantage of home field   The Dodgers have taken home field advantage away from the Blue Jays with their Game 2 win. That doesn't mean a whole lot -- the Blue Jays lost Games 1 and 2 at home to the Mariners in the ALCS, remember -- but it's not nothing either. These two teams were among baseball's best at home during the regular season while only being so-so on the road. The numbers:      W-LRun differentialDodgers at home \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t52-29 (.642) \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t+94 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tDodgers on road \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t41-40 (.506) \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t+48 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t   W-LRun differentialBlue Jays at home \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t54-27 (.667) \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t+94 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tBlue Jays on road \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t40-41 (.494) \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t-17 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tEvery team performs better at home for a multitude of reasons. Their rosters are built for their ballpark, they have better training and preparation facilities behind the scenes, they get to sleep in their own beds, etc. The home/road split is extreme for these two teams though. The Blue Jays and Dodgers were juggernauts at home this year and .500-ish teams on the road.   The Mariners were unable to take advantage of playing Games 3-5 at home in the ALCS. They took a 2-0 series lead to Seattle and dropped Games 3 and 4 to even the series 2-2. The Dodgers won't want to turn home field advantage back over to the Blue Jays and see this series go back to Toronto. They were a great team at Dodger Stadium this season. Now they have to play like it.       Toronto Blue Jays   How much can Bichette give?   All-Star shortstop Bo Bichette is on Toronto's World Series roster and he's playing a new position: second base. Going into Game 1, Bichette had not played since suffering a knee injury on Sept. 6. It is clearly still affecting him -- he's moving gingerly and grimaced a few times in Games 1 and 2 -- but he's grinding through it, and he volunteered to move to second base (a position he'd never played in MLB) because that's where his defensive limitations would hurt the least. Still, Bichette managed to do this in Game 1:   Bichette started Game 1, went 1 for 2 with a walk, then was removed for a pinch-runner after drawing a walk to lead off what turned into a nine-run sixth inning. It was a 2-2 game at the time though, and the Blue Jays needed a faster, healthier runner on the bases. Bichette did not start Game 2. He instead pinch-hit with two outs and the bases empty and the Blue Jays down 3-1 in the seventh.\"I think tomorrow being off kind of plays into today's thinking a little  bit,\" Schneider said Saturday afternoon about Bichette being out of the Game 2 lineup. \"But I think at this point, again, no one's feeling 100%, so if it's a game that he's starting -- starting Game 3 -- and he  plays nine innings, I think we're going to be OK with that.\"   My guess is Bichette will start Game 3, sit Game 4 (and perhaps pinch-hit), and then start Game 5. An every-other-day schedule, basically, which isn't uncommon for a player coming back from a fairly significant injury. Is there a way to get more from Bichette though? Does it make sense to DH him all three days and keep him out of the field? Even at full health, Bichette's in the lineup for his bat. He's never been much of a gloveman. The Blue Jays won't miss his defense.   The downside of DHing Bichette is moving George Springer to the outfield, where he hasn't played since Sept. 24, and putting either Addison Barger or (more likely) Nathan Lukes on the bench. There's a lot to consider here, including Bichette's health. If he can't play back-to-back games yet, then he can't play back-to-back games. He is one of Toronto's most impactful hitters though. If there's a way to get Bichette in the lineup all three games at Dodger Stadium, even at DH, it's worth exploring.   Avoiding bullpen fatigue   It's the World Series, and you do what you have to do to win today's game, but Toronto's relief crew has absorbed a heavy workload this postseason. Louie Varland has appeared in 11 of their 13 games and warmed up in at least one of the other two. He gave up a run in Game 7 of the ALCS. He faced five batters and got two outs in Game 2 of the World Series after warming up in Game 1 the night before. Is that just two tough outings back-to-back, or is Varland starting to feel the workload a bit? Lefty Mason Fluharty and righty Seranthony Domínguez have each appeared in eight games this postseason. Three Blue Jays relievers are in the top five in appearances this postseason, which makes sense because they're in the World Series and have played more games than most teams, but the Dodgers haven't put as much strain on their relievers. Blake Treinen and Roki Sasaki lead the Dodgers with seven appearances each and, remember, they played in the Wild Card Series. The Blue Jays did not.  Games 3-5 will played on three consecutive days and this is when the bullpen really gets tested. Guys will be asked to pitch back-to-back days, maybe even back-to-back-to-back days, and many of them have never pitched this deep into the calendar or with this many innings under their belt. It's a war of attrition now and, because the Dodgers have gotten so much more length from their starters, their bullpen is more rested than Toronto's, at least in theory. Fatigue will be a factor in Games 3-5. It always is.  Limit the freebies  \nHere, we're talking about free bases and free outs. During Schneider's three full years as manager, the Blue Jays have ranked among the league leaders in intentional walks and sacrifice bunts. Schneider is not afraid to put a runner on intentionally nor is he afraid to give away an out to advance a runner. Sound strategies at times, and strategies the Blue Jays have continued to employ this postseason. They've issued an MLB-high six intentional walks, and they've bunted three times (with several more attempts).  On one hand, this is what got the Blue Jays to the World Series and you should stick with what got you there. On the other hand, you don't want to give the Dodgers too many free baserunners with intentional walks, and you definitely don't want to give their rotation free outs. They get enough of those on their own. There will be times to put up four fingers or square around. Just don't go overboard with it. The Dodgers are better than any team the Blue Jays have played this postseason. Make them earn everything.  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Arguably the most interesting matchup in Week 8 pits the 4-1-1 Green Bay Packers against the 4-2 Pittsburgh Steelers on 'Sunday Night Football.' While both teams have playoff aspirations, it's also the first time that Aaron Rodgers has faced his former team since leaving Green Bay before the 2023 season. Rodgers has thrown for 1,270 yards with 14 touchdown passes and five interceptions thus far. His replacement for the Packers, Jordan Love, has tossed 10 touchdowns to only two interceptions, while throwing for 1,438 yards. Rodgers can become the fifth quarterback to defeat all 32 teams with a victory.With emotions running high on Sunday in Pittsburgh, which team is worth backing? Green Bay is a 3-point road favorite with the over/under at 45.5 points. Week 8's remaining slate should tell us plenty, especially with Lamar Jackson (hamstring), Brock Purdy (toe) and Jayden Daniels (hamstring) among the big names who have been ruled out.

The Eagles won't have A.J. Brown (hamstring), but Cohen still thinks Philadelphia will be able to exploit a New York defense coming off a pitiful performance last week, especially since Brian Burns, who leads the NFL with nine sacks, is questionable to suit up.\"It's inexplicable how the Giants gave up 33 points in the fourth quarter to lose to Denver last week. One of the most improbable NFL results you'll ever see. How their defensive coordinator still has a job is beyond me. While they crushed Philadelphia two weeks ago on Thursday night, look for the Eagles to exact some revenge in Week 8. Though Saquon Barkley has looked like a shell of himself this season, the passing game is showing signs of life with Jalen Hurts and Devonta Smith having big games in Week 7. Look for them to cover the touchdown spread on Sunday. Eagles 28, Giants 18\". See his other Week 8 football score predictions at SportsLine.How to make Week 8 NFL score predictionsIn addition, Cohen is picking one game to fly over the projected total. You can see who it is at SportsLine, and use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for just $1.Who wins every Week 8 NFL game, and which game is a must bet for the over?

Jackson was a full participant in practice on Friday with his hamstring injury, but listed as questionable to play. On Saturday, Baltimore officially ruled out the two-time NFL MVP for the third straight game. Tyler Huntley gets the start at quarterback over Cooper Rush. In their two games without Jackson, the Ravens were outscored 61-13. Overall, Baltimore (1-5) has lost four straight games, and a five-game losing streak would be the third-longest in franchise history.The Bears, on the other hand, are riding a winning streak they'd very much like to keep intact. Chicago has won four straight after an 0-2 start, and a fifth straight win would tie their longest winning streak over the past decade. New coach Ben Johnson has revitalized the Caleb Williams-led offense, and the running game and defense have both improved as the season has gone on.\nWhere to watch Ravens vs. Bears liveDate: Sunday, Oct. 26 | Time: 1 p.m. ETWhere: M&T Bank Stadium -- Baltimore, MarylandTV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Ravens -2.5; O/U 44.5 (via FanDuel)Ravens vs. Bears: Need to knowCaleb Williams looks to find a groove. Williams has improved in his second season, especially when it comes to avoiding negative plays, but he has plateaued amid the four-game winning streak. Over the past three games, Williams has just two touchdown passes compared to two interceptions, and he recorded a season-worst 61.7 passer rating against the Saints last week.Ravens vs. Bears pick, prediction\nThe Ravens have lost four straight games, while the Bears have won four straight. Chicago is the only NFL team to score 21 points in every game this season, and also lead the NFL in takeaways (16) and turnover margin (+11). That's enough for me. Pick: Bears +2.5; Under 44.5\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        No one expected Daniel Jones to be spearheading the NFL's No. 1 offense in total points and No. 2 unit in total yards. But that's exactly how the 2025 NFL season has played out after seven weeks with the Colts averaging 33.1 points on 380.3 yards per game. The Colts are the largest favorite in the Week 8 NFL schedule, favored by 14.5 points against the Titans, and the SportsLine Machine Learning Model expects Jones and the Indianapolis offense to continue its dominance this weekend. The model has identified Jones Over 233.5 passing yards as one of its best bets for Week 8 NFL player props for NFL betting. Jones is averaging 255.7 passing yards per game in his first season in Indy, heading into a 4:25 p.m. ET matchup against the Titans. Along with backing Jones, the model also likes Saints running back Alvin Kamara Over 43.5 rushing yards and Falcons wide receiver Drake London Over 63.5 receiving yards among its Week 8 NFL player props best bets for online sports betting. Backup Saints running back Kendre Miller tore his ACL last week, and the model expects that to lead to more opportunities and production for Kamara to hit his Over for Week 8 NFL props. Targeting NFL player props is one way to approach Week 8 NFL betting at online sports betting sites. With NFL props available for almost every player in every game at sportsbooks, SportsLine's Machine Learning Model can help you find value to add to your Week 8 NFL picks at various sportsbooks. They can also help new users take advantage of sportsbook promos like the latest Fanatics Sportsbook promo code, which allows new users to bet and get up to $2,000 back in No Sweat Bets in FanCash. Built using cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques by SportsLine's Data Science team, AI Predictions and AI Ratings are generated for each player prop. Best Week 8 NFL player prop picks:Daniel Jones, Colts, Over 233.5 passing yards (-115) MGMAlvin Kamara, Saints, Over 43.5 rushing yards (-112) DKDrake London, Falcons, Over 63.5 receiving yards (-114) FDParlay these picks for +561 odds with a FanDuel promo code, which gives new users $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: (odds subject to change)Daniel Jones, Colts, Over 233.5 passing yards (-115)Jones is fifth in the NFL in passing yards (1,790) while averaging a career-high 255.7 passing yards per game in his seventh NFL season and first year in Indianapolis. He had 288 passing yards and two touchdowns in a 38-24 win over the Chargers last week, and he's gone Over this total in four of seven games this season. He's thrown for more than 210 yards in all seven games this season, so he's never been far off reaching 234 passing yards. Jones threw for 228 yards on just 25 pass attempts, his fewest attempts of the season, in a 41-20 win over the Titans in Week 3. Although the Colts are 14.5-point favorites, the Titans could come out with a better offensive performance following the firing of head coach Brian Callahan, making the game competitive for longer and giving Jones more opportunities to pass. The model projects Jones for 263 passing yards on Sunday.Click here to bet Jones Over 233.5 passing yards at BetMGM, where new users receive up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses.Alvin Kamara, Saints, Over 43.5 rushing yards (-112)Kamara has gone Under this number in three straight games, but the 30-year-old went Over it in three of his first four games and had at least 42 rushing yards in each of his first four contests, and given the recent New Orleans backfield injury, Kamara could be in line for an even heavier workload. Backup running back Kendre Miller tore his ACL last week on just his second snap after three straight weeks of playing at least 30% of snaps. Miller was just starting to receive more opportunities with back-to-back games of playing on 39% of snaps after playing just 15% in each of the first two games of the season. Given Kamara's likely uptick in usage and a home matchup against Tampa Bay, the model projects 58 rushing yards for the veteran running back on Sunday.Click here to bet Kamara Over 43.5 rushing yards at DraftKings, where new users receive $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins and three months of NBA League Pass free.Drake London, Falcons, Over 63.5 receiving yards (-114)After back-to-back games with at least 110 yards, London was held to just 42 receiving yards last week. But his usage signaled someone who should have had a much stronger game, with London generating 10 targets, reaching double-digit targets for the fourth time this season. He only had four receptions, though, but with three straight games of at least 10 targets, the Falcons are clearly making it a priority to feature him in the offense. The fourth-year receiver is averaging a career-high 78.2 yards per game, as he's increased his per-game averages in each of his first four NFL seasons. The Falcons play the Dolphins, who are 29th in scoring defense (29.3 ppg allowed) and 26th in yards allowed (363.1 per game). Miami is allowing the highest completion percentage against (74.61%), so if the double-digit target trend continues, he'll likely secure far more than four receptions on Sunday, giving him a strong chance at hitting the Over. Click here to bet London Over 63.5 receiving yards at FanDuel, which gives new users $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins.Want more Week 8 NFL picks?You've seen the model's NFL picks for some popular NFL player props for Week 8 Now, get NFL Week 8 projections for every player prop at SportsLine.Also at SportsLine:You can also see the model's best bets for every Week 8 NFL game, including Bears vs. Ravens, Cowboys vs. Broncos and Packers vs. Steelers.

    "body": "\n        Making Week 8 Fantasy football picks will be harder than any other week, thus far, with six teams on byes. Those players who've been riding the bench all year on your team may finally see the light of day and get inserted into Week 8 Fantasy football lineups. Players like Chase Brown, Chris Olave, Romeo Doubs and Pat Freiermuth have been inconsistent this year but are coming off huge outings. Even Joe Flacco, with his 342-yard, 3-touchdown performance last Thursday, is now part of Fantasy football start/sit decisions for the week ahead.How should you handle Commanders skill players like the returning Terry McLaurin (quad) and Deebo Samuel (heel) now that Jayden Daniels (hamstring) is out? Plus, wideouts like Garrett Wilson, Drake London and Nico Collins are all out, so who could fill their voids on their respective teams? Before making your Week 8 Fantasy football picks, be sure to check out the Week 8 Fantasy football rankings from the proven computer model at SportsLine. Bet on every NFL Week 8 game at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your $5 initial wager wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:When it comes to ranking players, SportsLine's model beat human experts in Fantasy football for the past several seasons, especially when there were big differences in ranking. Over the course of a season, that could literally be the difference between winning your league or going home empty-handed.The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, including being ahead of the curve on players like A.J. Brown, Jonathan Taylor, Derrick Henry, Christian McCaffrey, Alvin Kamara and Jahmyr Gibbs. Anybody who banked on players like those could have made a run at their league title.Now, the model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, has revealed its Fantasy football rankings for Week 8 of the 2025 NFL season. Head to SportsLine now to see them. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. Top Week 8 Fantasy football picks One surprise in Week 8: The model is fading Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott, who has an over/under of 22.5 completions. Prescott sits third amongst quarterbacks in Fantasy points, thanks to 13 touchdowns versus zero picks over the last four weeks. However, none of those defenses match up with the Broncos unit he will face on Sunday, as only Houston has allowed fewer Fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks than Denver.Denver ranks first in sacks, allows the lowest completion percentage and has allowed the second-fewest passing scores on the year. The one spot where it is vulnerable versus quarterbacks is the run game as mobile QBs like Daniel Jones and Jaxson Dart have rushing touchdowns versus Denver. However, a litany of injuries has made Prescott a stationary quarterback who ranks 25th at the position in rushing yards (56). Thus, Prescott may not warrant a spot in Week 8 Fantasy football lineups as he sits outside the top 12 in QB rankings.Another curveball: The model is high on Panthers receiver Tetairoa McMillan. The No. 8 overall pick has had an inconsistent rookie year as he had 100 yards in Week 2 and a two-touchdown outing in Week 6, but he has no other games with either a touchdown or more than 73 yards. McMillan enters Week 8 ranking 27th amongst wideouts in Fantasy points in both standard and PPR leagues.However, he and Carolina will face a Buffalo defense on Sunday which has fallen apart in recent weeks. The Bills gave up just 125.8 passing yards over their first four games but then allowed an average of 250 yards over their last two. Both Stefon Diggs and Drake London had 140-plus receiving yards over the last two weeks versus Buffalo, and six of the seven passing scores the team has allowed have been to wideouts. McMillan slots among the top 12 in positional Fantasy rankings for Week 8, making him a WR1 in 12-team leagues.

The former LSU standout exploded in 2024 with one of the most dominant statistical seasons at wide receiver in NFL history, recording 127 receptions for 1,708 yards and 17 touchdowns to claim the receiving \"Triple Crown.\" He averaged over 100 yards per game and cemented his status as one of the NFL's premier playmakers. Chase has continued to produce at a high level in 2025 with 58 catches for 629 yards and five touchdowns through seven games, though his yards per reception have dipped slightly to 10.8. He remains the focal point of the Bengals' passing attack and one of the most feared receivers in football. See who else to roster here.Part of McClure's optimal NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering Falcons running back Bijan Robinson. The former Texas standout took a big step forward in 2024, carrying the ball 304 times for 1,456 yards and 14 rushing touchdowns while adding 61 receptions for 431 yards and another score through the air. That breakout season firmly established him as one of the NFL's premier dual-threat running backs. Through six games in 2025, Robinson has totaled 97 carries for 524 yards (5.7 yards per carry) and two touchdowns, along with 30 receptions for 390 yards and two scores. His efficiency has improved in both rushing and receiving, showcasing his continued development and explosiveness. The Falcons' offense, which could be without Michael Penix Jr. (questionable, knee), remains built around his versatile skill set, utilizing him as both a workhorse on the ground and a dynamic weapon in the passing game.

Pittsburgh (4-2) is coming off a disappointing 33-31 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 7, while the Packers (4-1-1) rallied to defeat the Arizona Cardinals 27-23. Pittsburgh still holds a 1.5-game lead over Cincinnati in the AFC North, while Green Bay holds a lead by percentages over the Detroit Lions in the NFC North. The Packers enter as a 3-point favorite in one of three games with a Week 8 NFL spread of 3 points or fewer, while another is 49ers vs. Texans (-1.5).  There are a number of intriguing matchups on the Week 8 NFL schedule, including Giants at Eagles (-7.5), Cowboys at Broncos (-3.5) and Commanders at Chiefs (-11.5) on 'Monday Night Football,' in which Washington will be minus Jayden Daniels (hamstring).

Brown (hamstring), to cover against the New York Giants on Sunday. The Eagles will look to avenge a 34-17 loss to the Giants on 'Thursday Night Football' in Week 6. Philadelphia rebounded with a 28-22 win over the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday as Jalen Hurts completed 19 of 23 passes for 326 yards and three touchdowns. New York, meanwhile, blew a 19-point lead in the fourth quarter and dropped a 33-32 decision to the Denver Broncos.The Giants are led by rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart, who threw for 283 yards and three touchdowns with one interception in the loss at Denver.

    "body": "\n        Developing a successful NFL DFS strategy can take many forms, but one of the most common approaches is focusing on games with the highest projected point totals when identifying top NFL DFS picks and building NFL DFS stacks. The highest over/under in the Week 8 NFL odds for the Sunday main slate is 51 in the Cowboys vs. Broncos matchup. Other potential high-scoring matchups include Bills vs. Panthers (47.5), Titans vs. Colts (48), and Buccaneers vs. Saints (46.5). Thus, you can expect stars like Dak Prescott, Bo Nix, CeeDee Lamb, Josh Allen, Jonathan Taylor and Alvin Kamara to be among the core players in many NFL DFS lineups. Players of that caliber, however, will set back your NFL DFS salary cap, forcing you to search for more potential NFL DFS sleepers and NFL DFS values. Should players like Daniel Jones or Baker Mayfield find their way into your quarterback slot for Sunday's main slate? Will underperforming players like Saquon Barkley and Tua Tagovailoa finally live up to their price tags on NFL DFS sites? Before making any NFL DFS picks for Sunday or locking in NFL DFS lineups on sites like DraftKings and FanDuel, be sure to check out SportsLine's advanced NFL DFS lineup optimizer.New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, where they can pick at Underdog and get $100 in site credits after making a $5 wager:The DFS Optimizer uses info from the SportsLine Advanced-Data Projection Model and DFS Professional Millionaire Mike McClure to identify top DFS picks/plays for any slate on betting apps like DraftKings and FanDuel.

The former first-round pick out of Duke signed with the Indianapolis Colts in 2025 after a challenging 2024 season with the New York Giants. In 2024, he played in ten games and threw for 2,070 yards with eight touchdowns and seven interceptions, completing 63.3% of his passes with a 79.4 passer rating. Jones beat out Anthony Richardson for the Colts' starting job, and has gotten off to an outstanding start to the 2025 season. He's thrown for 1,790 passing yards, ten touchdowns, and just three interceptions through seven games, with a passer rating above 105 and 83 yards and four scores on the ground. Jones is averaging roughly 255 passing yards per game this season and has elevated the Colts' offense into one of the more efficient units in the AFC. See who else to pick here.The optimizer's NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering Broncos wide receiver Courtland Sutton ($6,200 on DraftKings and $7,700 on FanDuel) as he takes on the Cowboys. The former second-round pick out of SMU had a strong 2024 campaign with the Broncos, catching 81 passes for 1,081 yards and eight touchdowns while averaging 13.3 yards per reception. Entering the 2025 season, he's off to another solid start. Through seven games, Sutton has 33 receptions for 469 yards and three touchdowns with a 14.2-yard per catch average. Sutton's consistency and chemistry with quarterback Bo Nix have helped stabilize Denver's passing game, particularly in key third-down and red-zone situations. At 6-foot-4, Sutton remains one of the league's most reliable contested-catch receivers, using his size and strength to win battles downfield. You can see the rest of the optimizer's NFL DFS picks here.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to build Sunday Week 8 NFL DFS lineupsThe NFL DFS Optimizer is also targeting multiple undervalued players who could explode for huge numbers on Sunday. Those players could be the difference between winning your tournaments and cash games or going home with nothing. You can only see who they are, and the rest of the optimizer's NFL DFS picks, at SportsLine. So what is the optimal NFL DFS lineup for Sunday, and which under-the-radar NFL DFS picks offer huge value? Visit SportsLine now to see optimal NFL DFS picks, rankings, advice and stacks, all from an NFL DFS optimizer that simulates every game 10,000 times, and find out.\n            ",

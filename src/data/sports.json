    "body": "\n        Eleven 2025-26 college football bowl games and four playoff matchup are in the books, but some bowl confidence pools remain open for entries or modifications as there are nearly 30 matchups remaining to make college football bowl picks on before the curtain closes on this season. The biggest remaining college football spread has Utah as a 14.5-point favorite over Nebraska in the Las Vegas Bowl on Wednesday. The spread dropped one point after the announcement that Kyle Whittingham would depart for Michigan before this game. While putting faith in big favorites is a part of just about everyone's college football bowl confidence strategy, correctly predicting a couple upsets can give you a big edge in any football pools. Anticipated matchups outside of the CFP include Penn State vs. Clemson (-2.5), Vanderbilt (-4.5) vs. Iowa, Georgia Tech vs. BYU (-3.5), Tennessee vs. Illinois (+2.5) and Michigan vs. Texas (-7.5). Before making any college football predictions for bowl season, be sure to see the latest college football bowl confidence picks from SportsLine's proven model.New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $75 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times, and it is 31-19 on its top-rated college football money-line picks since the beginning of the 2024 season. Now, it has turned its attention to the latest college football odds and 2025-26 bowl season college football betting for confidence pools. Head here to see every pick. New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Top 2025-26 college football bowl confidence picks  One of the model's most confident picks is that No. 16 USC (-6.5), who will have quarterback Jayden Maiava, gets a comfortable win over TCU in the Alamo Bowl on Dec. 30. USC went 9-3 in the regular season, with all three defeats coming versus ranked teams. TCU found itself in the Top 25 once -- back in September -- before having a pedestrian run through the Big 12 schedule, finishing 5-4. Even with the Horned Frogs playing in the easier conference than the Trojans, USC both averaged more points and allowed fewer points per game. USC sports a 32-9 (78%) straight-up record when favored since Lincoln Riley came aboard in 2022, as it is projected to easily take care of business in San Antonio. SportsLine's model has the Trojans prevailing nearly 70% of the time. See all of the model's college football bowl confidence picks here.Another one of the bowl confidence predictions the model is high on: Texas State (-11.5) handles Rice in the Armed Forces Bowl at 1 p.m. ET on Jan. 2 in a matchup of Lone Star State foes. The Bobcats bounced back from a five-game losing streak to win their last three on the way to claim bowl eligibility. Rice, meanwhile, went 5-7 and only got eligibility because there weren't enough .500 teams. The Owls lost six of their final eight games. SportsLine's model projects that Texas State wins 75% of the time, making the Bobcats the clear side to back in confidence pools. See the rest of the college football bowl confidence predictions here. How to make college football bowl confidence picksThe model has also made the call on who wins every other bowl game. There are several teams that win at least 70% of the time, so you need to go big on those matchups, as well as plenty of underdogs that win outright. You can get all the model's picks at SportsLine.So who wins every college football bowl game, and which matchups should you assign the most confidence points to?

    "body": "\n        The Las Vegas Raiders officially ruled out defensive end Maxx Crosby for Sunday's game against the New York Giants due to a knee injury. That announcement comes on the heels of reports that Crosby left the team facility after receiving the news from the team that he wouldn't play, a decision he \"vehemently\" disagreed with, according to Fox.When first-year Raiders coach Pete Carroll addressed reporters Friday, he said Crosby will not play in Week 17 and has been dealing with a nagging knee injury since the Kansas City Chiefs game in Week 7. He also acknowledged that Crosby was understandably frustrated with the team's decision to withhold him from playing, so Carroll excused him from the building.\"We talked when he was getting out of here that he's been fighting this thing for nine weeks or whenever Kansas City was,\" Carroll said. \"Each week, he has done everything you could possibly imagine a guy could do to play. We've worked with him to get through it. After an evaluation we did on Monday or Tuesday, it's just too bad. He didn't want to take the news like that. I didn't want to take the news like that. ... If we'd have let him, he'd have been out there, and he would not have hesitated. But he knows he's banged up.\"He said, 'I'd like to get out of here,'\" Carroll added. \"I said, 'Yeah, get out of here. Take off.'\"\nAsked to characterize Crosby's reaction to being shut down, Carroll said it was \"exactly like you think he would do and should do.\" Knowing Crosby's competitive nature, Carroll said he expected that response, especially since Crosby has been battling through the injury for weeks.\"As a matter of fact, I anticipated it all the way throughout,\" Carroll said. \"I've been with him since I saw him get on the bus in the Kansas City game -- just having trouble stepping up onto the bus and getting out of that game. He's just been fighting his ass off the whole time. He's impeccably positioned himself as good a competitor as you can be. You can't battle more than he's battled. He'd do anything to be playing.\"\n        \n            \n                Battle for draft top pick: Giants at Raiders set for rare Week 17 matchup that NFL hasn't seen in 44 years\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nCarroll denied that this decision would cause a rift between Crosby and the organization, despite speculation that the star pass rusher could now be a trade target in the offseason. While he didn't rule out Crosby for Week 18, Carroll did say it was a possibility.\nAt 2-13, the Raiders and Giants are both in contention for the No. 1 pick in the 2026 NFL Draft and their Week 17 meeting will have major implications on which team picks first in April. The Raiders are 2.5-point home underdogs against the Giants, per DraftKings Sportsbook. Crosby was asked about the possibility of the Raiders landing the No. 1 pick earlier this week and was blunt with his feelings on the subject.\"I don't give a s--- about the pick to be honest,\" Crosby told reporters Tuesday. \"I don't play for that. That's not my job. My job is to be the best defensive end in the world and that's what I'm focused on every day, and being a great leader and being an influence -- being that guy on a consistent basis for my team. That's [the NFL Draft] their job, the front office, the coaches, they do that. But that's got nothing to do with me.\" \nThe 28-year-old Crosby, one of the NFL's top pass rushers, has long been thought of as a top trade candidate, especially for a Las Vegas team that seems headed toward a long rebuild period. The Dallas Cowboys reportedly showed significant interest in Crosby before the 2025 trade deadline, but no deal materialized.Crosby, who has been vocal about his desire to stay with the Raiders, signed a three-year contract extension worth $106.5 million in March. At the time, it made him the highest-paid non-quarterback in the NFL. A fourth-round pick of the Raiders in the 2019 NFL Draft, Crosby has two second-team All-Pro honors and five Pro Bowl appearances during his time with the Raiders. He led the NFL in tackles for loss from 2022-23 and has reached double-digit sacks in three of the last four seasons. In 15 games this season, Crosby has 73 tackles, 28 tackles for loss and 10 sacks. \n            ",

White said. \"That's shifted this line through zero from the lookahead of Houston -1.5, along with the Chargers dominating an awful Cowboys defense. I expect the Raiders game to be a wake-up for Houston, and their edge rushers should have much more success against the Chargers' battered O-line than Dallas did. This feels to me like it could be decided by 1-2 points, so I'll take the value off the lookahead for what I think is the better team overall.\" Back the Texans at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Over 38.5 in Packers vs. RavensBoth of these teams' starting quarterbacks left with injuries last week, but they have capable backups as well. Ravens backup quarterback Tyler Huntley has started 15 games over his six-year NFL career, while playing in 29 contests, and he made five starts last year with the Dolphins. He completed 9 of 10 passes for 65 yards in relief of Lamar Jackson last week, and with playmakers such as Derrick Henry, Zay Flowers and Mark Andrews in the offense, Baltimore should be able to score regardless. Jordan Love entered the concussion protocol for the Packers, and backup Malik Willis left with a shoulder injury last week. Love has been ruled out, but Willis is expected to start. These two offenses and coaches are too capable not to put up points regardless of the quarterback, which is why the model remains confident in backing the Over in its Saturday best bets. The Over hits in 57% of the model's simulations. Back the Over at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:LSU (-110) to defeat HoustonLane Kiffin will take over as LSU's head coach, but not on Saturday, and the Tigers can rally around Frank Wilson one last time as the team's interim head coach. LSU does have some players opting out, but key players are also deciding to play, including sophomore quarterback Michael Van Buren Jr., who is 2-1 as a starter since taking over the job. The Tigers nearly closed their regular season with an upset victory on the road against No. 8 Oklahoma before falling, 17-13. LSU also won last year's Texas Bowl against a Texas team, so they won't be intimidated by the environment. Houston (9-3) hasn't played an SEC team this season, as the Cougars may be at a talent disadvantage on Saturday.

    "body": "\n        A Penn State vs. Clemson postseason matchup felt almost inevitable entering the 2025 season -- just not like this. It was easy to imagine the Nittany Lions and Tigers colliding in a College Football Playoff semifinal at either the Peach Bowl or Fiesta Bowl as two national championship contenders. Instead, after a pair of startlingly disappointing campaigns, these former top-four teams will close out their 2025 seasons in a far more modest setting: the Pinstripe Bowl.Together, the programs combined for 11 losses -- an almost unthinkable total given their preseason projections -- as injuries, inconsistency and missed opportunities derailed both seasons by mid-October.Neither side arrives in New York at full strength. Penn State is navigating a coaching transition, with interim Terry Smith handling bowl preparation while newly hired Matt Campbell focuses on long-term priorities. Clemson's depth has been tested just as severely, as Dabo Swinney confirmed 27 scholarship players will miss the game, including seven starters across offense and defense due to injuries, NFL Draft opt-outs or other reasons.With rosters thinned and postseason stakes reset, motivation will certainly be the decisive factor in this bowl game.\n  Penn State vs. Clemson: Need to know  Clemson QB Cade Klubnik will play: For the final time in his college career, Klubnik will suit up as one of just six Tigers quarterbacks to reach at least 25 wins as a starter since World War II -- posting a 26-13 (.667) overall record. He ranks fourth in program history with 73 touchdown passes and 9,930 yards passing, while ranking second in career completions (894) -- seven from tying Tajh Boyd for most.Defensive play-calling: Penn State safeties coach Anthony Poindexter will call the defensive plays with former coordinator Jim Knowles now at Tennessee. It marks the third time in five seasons since joining the staff that Poindexter has assumed the role. Meanwhile, Clemson will maintain some continuity on that side of the ball, with defensive coordinator Tom Allen -- who was in Happy Valley last year -- calling the game from the booth as he closes out his first season in the role for the Tigers.Penn State dealing with opt-outs: There are several notable opt-outs on the Nittany Lions' side in this bowl as well: Defensive tackle Zane Durant, safety Zakee Wheatley, running back Nicholas Singleton and offensive lineman Vega Ioane.\n  Where to watch Penn State vs. Clemson: liveDate: Saturday, Dec. 27 | Time: 12 p.m. ET  Location: Yankee Stadium -- Bronx, New York  TV: ABC | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)Penn State vs. Clemson prediction, picks  \nBowl games like this are notoriously difficult to forecast, especially when motivation and roster availability are moving targets on both sidelines. History offers a slight clue: the Tigers are 5-1 in their last six non-College Football Playoff or New Year's Six bowl appearances since 2009, a sign that Dabo Swinney's teams tend to handle these in-between stages well. But, conditions at Yankee Stadium could further complicate matters. Forecasts call for temperatures hovering just above freezing, with a chance of morning ice that could leave the playing surface slick. With Kaytron Allen expected to be available, Penn State is positioned to lean on its ground game against a Clemson defense depleted along the interior. Pick: Penn State +3.5\n                    \n

Stroud. Houston has the league's top defense, ranking first in both points allowed and yards allowed, and it's a defense that Justin Herbert knows all too well. In the Jan. 2025 playoff game between these teams, Houston picked off Herbert four times, which is one more pick than Herbert had in the entire 2024 regular season. Speaking of turnovers, the Texans have committed an NFL-low of five giveaways during their 10-2 run over their last dozen games, and they're on pace to be the first team in 17 years to not allow 250 passing yards in a game. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Chargers can coverWhile the Texans have lost multiple games ATS during their winning streak, the same can't be said about L.A. which has covered in all four games of its four-game win streak. The Chargers have clinched a playoff spot, but they still has a huge incentive in front of them as they can get the No. 1 seed, and a bye, if they win out. Meanwhile, Los Angeles' defense has actually performed better than Houston's over the last two months as L.A. has given up a league-low of 254.5 total yards over the last eight games. The Chargers also have a big historical edge in regard to the spread, going 7-3 versus the line over their 10 all-time meetings. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Texans vs. Chargers picksSportsLine's model has simulated Chargers vs. Texans 10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 41 combined points.

The professional wrestling promotion's final pay-per-view of 2025 features MJF's return to the world title scene, plus the finals of the annual Continental Classic.Four familiar foes headline Saturday's show in Chicago. Samoa Joe was supposed to defend his AEW world title against former champions Swerve Strickland and \"Hangman\" Adam Page. MJF made a surprise appearance during the match contract signing, evoking his right to challenge for the world title, which he earned by winning the Casino Gauntlet match at All Out. MJF claimed that winning on Saturday would make him the 10th man to become a world champion twice before turning 30, joining an illustrious list that includes John Cena, The Rock, Brock Lesnar, Randy Orton, and Lou Thesz.Another man on that exclusive list is Kazuchika Okada. The reigning AEW unified champion is a finalist in the annual Continental Classic round-robin tournament. Okada faces reigning IWGP world heavyweight champion Konosuke Takeshita in the semifinals. The winner will face the victor of the other semifinal match, Jon Moxley vs. Kyle Fletcher, later the same evening.Below is how you can catch all the action on Saturday night.Where to watch 2025 AEW Worlds EndDate: Dec. 27, 2025Location: Now Arena -- Hoffman Estates, IllinoisTime: 8 p.m. ETWatch: HBO Max, Prime Video, PPV.com, YouTube, and Fubo\n2025 AEW Worlds End match cardAEW World Championship -- Samoa Joe (c) vs. Swerve Strickland vs. MJF vs. \"Hangman\" Adam PageContinental Championship -- TBA vs. TBA (Continental Classic finals)AEW Women's World Championship -- Kris Statlander (c) vs. Jamie HayterKazuchika Okada vs. Konosuke Takeshita (Continental Classic semifinals)AEW Women's World Tag Team Championships -- Babes of Wrath (Harley Cameron & Willow Nightingale) (c) vs. Mercedes Mone & AthenaKyle Fletcher vs. Jon Moxley (Continental Classic semifinals)  AEW World Tag Team Championships -- FTR (Dax Harwood & Cash Wheeler) vs. Bang Bang Gang (Juice Robinson & Austin Gunn) (Chicago Street Fight)Darby Allin vs. Gabe KiddDeath Riders (Claudio Castagnoli, Daniel Garcia, Wheeler Yuta & Marina Shafir) vs. The Conglomeration (Mark Briscoe, Orange Cassidy & Roderick Strong) and \"Timeless\" Toni Storm (Mixed Nuts Mayhem match)Sisters of Sin (Julia Hart & Skye Blue) vs. Hyan and Maya World**denotes pre-show match\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Joe Burrow's comments this December have several NFL sharks circling in the Cincinnati waters.Sources from multiple teams tell CBS Sports they anticipate several teams will attempt a pursuit of trading for Burrow in the offseason. This comes after weeks of Burrow voicing frustration with losing, despite saying he plans to remain in Cincinnati in 2026 and despite the Bengals showing no interest in dealing him.\"There are probably only a handful [of teams] that wouldn't at least make an attempt,\" said one NFC front office executive.\"They all should,\" said one source familiar with the Bengals and Burrow. \"But the Bengals aren't dealing him, and he doesn't want to leave.\"\nBurrow said two weeks ago he wasn't having any fun playing football and was frustrated by everything. Sources explained then he was venting because he's not winning after making yet another injury comeback, but that he is not contemplating retirement or moving on from Cincinnati.\n        \n            \n                Last-minute NFL Week 17 picks: Joe Burrow, Bengals stay hot, plus why we like two specific underdogs\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLast week, after being officially eliminated from the playoffs, Burrow didn't deny letting his mind think about not finishing his career in Cincinnati, but that he expects to \"play well and consistently great for a long time.\"Burrow, 29, is the same age as Andrew Luck when he retired, which has helped give rise to this speculation. But beyond that, Burrow is a former No. 1 pick in Cincinnati who can't get over the hump, just like Carson Palmer years before him.\nFollowing the 2010 season, Palmer asked for a trade out of Cincinnati. Bengals owner Mike Brown declined the request, and Palmer threatened retirement. A cold war ensued between the two sides where the Bengals drafted Andy Dalton and Palmer did not report to the team. It wasn't until the Raiders, coached by former Bengals assistant Hue Jackson, needed a starter that Cincinnati agreed to deal their former top pick for a first-round pick and a conditional second rounder.Last week ESPN reported the Miami Dolphins offered four first-round picks in 2020 in exchange for the top pick and the opportunity to select Burrow. Cincinnati declined, of course. That was when the Bengals had no other quarterback and had the opportunity to reset as an organization with a top quarterback (one off a Heisman Trophy and a national championship) on a rookie contract.Now Burrow is playing on a five-year, $275 million extension. What would the theoretical price be?\n\"Probably depends on if a team has a young QB or players to offer but imagine they won't even answer the phone if you don't have at least two first-round picks plus more,\" said one NFC front office exec. \"Maybe even three if you're not doing it with any players involved.\"The floor for any such deal would seemingly be the Deshaun Watson trade from 2022. The Browns sent three first-round picks, two second rounders and one third to the Texans to acquire Watson (and a sixth-round pick).But even that wasn't enough for one AFC team executive, who told CBS Sports a \"Ricky Williams type\" of trade would have to transpire. That was when the Saints traded their entire 1999 draft, plus two future first-round picks, to Washington in order to move up seven spots and select the Texas running back.\nIt is unimaginable such a trade would take place in today's NFL, just as it's unimaginable in Cincinnati's building that the Bengals will trade Burrow any time soon. Still, teams make calls on players presumed to be unavailable all the time.\"You can always ask for shit,\" said one longtime AFC team executive.Burrow said earlier this month he \"can't see\" not being a member of the Bengals next season, and he has a no-trade clause as part of his contract extension. But when asked if he sees himself finishing his career with Cincinnati, Burrow said \"a lot of crazy things happen every year.\"Elite quarterbacks staying in just one place is more rare than one would think. Troy Aikman is the last Hall of Fame quarterback to have played for just one team, and he was inducted into the Hall two decades ago. Perhaps Ben Roethlisberger is the only future Hall candidate who could get in having worn just one jersey (since Hall voters did not think Eli Manning was worthy of deep-finalist consideration last year). \nTeams that figure to be in the quarterback market include the Raiders, Browns, Jets, Dolphins and Cardinals. The Steelers, Colts, Rams and Vikings could also all be in need of a quarterback depending upon how the early offseason plays out.And teams that have a quarterback today could also be interested in one of the best players in football. After all, if Cincinnati were to ever trade Burrow, the Bengals would be in need of a quarterback themselves.No team has more draft capital than the Jets. Gang Green has two first-round and two second-round picks in 2026. In 2027, the Jets have three first-round picks. The five combined picks -- one of which is currently the No. 5 pick in April -- would be enough to acquire nearly any player in the NFL if he were made available.\nSetting up Tennessee's imminent coaching searchI don't see the Titans as pigeon-holing themselves into any \"type\" of head coach ahead of their search process.Yes, I believe previous experience is going to be a plus after Tennessee fired Brian Callahan after just a season and a half. But I believe the Titans will still interview candidates who have not previously been coaches, and those candidates' vision for how they fill out a staff will be crucial. If a young coach has veteran coaches on his staff, for example, that would be a boost.\n        \n            \n                Brian Callahan's quick flameout continues the Titans' stunning three-year cycle of chaos. Now what?\n                \n                    Jonathan Jones                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nI would anticipate Chiefs OC Matt Nagy and former Packers and Cowboys head coach Mike McCarthy to get long looks in Tennessee based off their relationships with Titans GM Mike Borgonzi (Nagy) and president of football operations Chad Brinker (McCarthy). Defensive coordinators like Jeff Hafley (Packers), Chris Shula (Rams) and Jesse Minter (Chargers) have been expected to get interview slips as well, according to sources.\nThere will be others to interview there, and I wouldn't necessarily call anyone the frontrunner just yet. But I won't be surprised to see this process move quickly in Tennessee considering all the lead time the Titans have had to prepare.With the benefit of time, this job looks better than it did two months ago. Rookie quarterback Cam Ward has played much better recently, so there should be less hesitation from a prospective candidate. The Titans have won two of the past three, including one over the Browns starting a fellow rookie, and a victory Sunday against the Saints and rookie Tyler Shough would increase the vibes in the Music City.But maybe even more importantly than the quarterback is Tennessee's owner. Amy Adams Strunk has not developed the best reputation in hiring circles after firing a winning GM (Jon Robinson), a winning head coach (Mike Vrabel), a GM after two years (Ran Carthon), a head coach after 23 games (Callahan) and putting together an initially confusing front office setup, all while rarely speaking publicly and never taking questions from independent media.\n\"It's been a tough few years for the owner and I could see her fading more into the background,\" said one AFC team source.A less involved owner, especially one who has struggled with showing patience, would make the Titans job more attractive.Shoe soon on other foot for Ben Johnson, BearsThe Chicago Bears are in the playoffs for the first time in a half-decade and, as of this writing, still have a shot at the No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs. We all know about the turnaround Ben Johnson & Co. have put together in the Windy City. But how about that \"& Co.\" part?\nThe Bears are braced for a potential raiding of the Chicago staff this winter.There are several coordinator candidates who dot this staff. Offensive coordinator Declan Doyle doesn't call plays, but he's been under Johnson's tutelage all season long and hasn't yet turned 30. The Bears could block teams from interviewing Doyle for their OC position if they so choose.But outside of Doyle and the other coordinators, the Bears can't block teams from interviewing other assistant coaches. Press Taylor has been revitalized in Chicago as the pass game coordinator in his first major offensive role without Doug Pederson as the head coach. J.T. Barrett, the former Ohio State quarterback, has been working his way up the coaching ladder the past few years, and the Bears quarterbacks coach will likely get OC interviews this cycle.Last but not least on offense is running backs coach Eric Bieniemy. The two-time Super Bowl-winning offensive coordinator saw a brief career decline when he left Kansas City. The matches didn't work with the Commanders in 2023 or UCLA last year. This year leading the running backs for Chicago, Bieniemy has a backfield of D'Andre Swift and Kyle Monangai -- there's just something about seventh-round RB picks out of Rutgers -- has already combined for more than 2,100 scrimmage yards.League sources believe Dan Campbell will be in the market for a new offensive coordinator this year, and perhaps he pulls from Johnson's staff one year after Johnson took flight from Detroit. Defensively, people need to understand just how great of a coach Al Harris has been. The former All-Pro and Pro Bowler has been coaching up takeaways as well as any assistant coach in the league the last few years.Harris, Chicago's team's defensive backs coach and defensive passing game coordinator, has overseen a unit responsible for a league-leading 21 interceptions. A coach the past 13 years, Harris was previously with the Cowboys. In his final four years in Dallas, the Cowboys had the most interceptions in the league with 72 between 2021 to 2024. He had Trevon Diggs and DaRon Bland as first-team All Pros. Today, the Cowboys have the second-fewest interceptions in the league this season.The ball is worth millions, and no one has the turnover pelts on the wall like Harris.The next hot new GM in the NFL? I stopped doing hot-names lists a few years ago because, invariably, you leave someone deserving off the list. The list is never long enough for those who aren't on it, and it's always too long for just about anyone who is on the list. But in this space over the past few weeks I have highlighted a handful of names when, during my phone calls across the league, sources bring them up unprompted.That has happened the last few weeks with Josh Williams, the director of scouting and football operations for the San Francisco 49ers. Williams, 38, is in his 15th season with the Niners and in the second in this director's role, and his name has been mentioned in other NFL facilities as potentially the next new, young general manager of an NFL team. San Francisco has seen Ran Carthon and Adam Peters leave for GM gigs in the past four years, and the team remains loaded with future GMs in John Lynch's front office with AGM RJ Gillen, VP of player personnel Tariq Ahmad, VP of Football R&D Matt Ploenzke and, of course, Williams.Teams typically don't hire guys to be their GM who are \"just\" at the director level. But Williams was a finalist for the Jaguars job last year that ultimately went to fellow 30-something James Gladstone. Williams's experience scouting college players (read: evaluating players who will be cost controlled for three-to-five years) will be considered a plus by NFL team owners who have already been exposed to him via the NFL's accelerator program.At present only the Dolphins have a vacant GM position, though sources are keeping an eye on as many as five other teams that could have openings at the end of the season. Don't be surprised to see Williams -- among many other previously named qualified candidates -- get interviews this cycle.My long-tail concerns about new stadium trendsWe won't know for another decade or two, but something tells me the trends we see with pro sports teams' homes will wind up being cyclical at some point. What was old is new, and what's new will soon become old.The Kansas City Chiefs will be moving across state lines, where the forever-outdoors team will have a dome in Kansas in the 2030s. There are plenty of complaints I could have here. We could bemoan another generic-looking stadium, or the (likely) loss of another natural grass field, or the use of tax dollars going to these stadia, or some franchises/cities going all-in for the hope of one (1) Super Bowl and/or Final Four hosting opportunity. But that's all for another column.The old stadiums don't work today because there aren't enough luxury suites and seats to maximize profit. The 75,000-seat cathedrals are being replaced by stadia seating 60,000-plus so that the bigger, comfier seats can bring in many more dollars. That stadium can sit on land surrounding by an entertainment district also owned by the team that pours in money 300-plus days a year rather than for just 10 games. The math is rather easy, especially when team owners get to pocket more of those luxury-seat dollars instead of putting them in the revenue-sharing pool.But what happens when we reach a breaking point? What happens when fans decide parking for $100 is not going to be worth it? When it costs a family of four a cool grand just for entry into the venue? The price of a drink at games keeps rising while alcohol consumption is at a nearly century-low in America. What happens when the concession money begins to dry up?Will taxpayers eventually revolt? Will teams try to come back to city centers? Might it eventually be more important to get as many people in the building as possible versus identifying the top socio-economic bands? All of that seems unlikely as we head into 2026, at least immediately. But a lot of what we're seeing today seemed unlikely a decade ago, too.One last thing on the topic of NFL stadiums. Let's look back 10 years from now and look ahead 10 years from now.December 27, 2015: Missouri houses the Rams and Chiefs. Illinois has the Bears. There are no NFL teams in Los Angeles. Eight teams play home games under a roof.December 27, 2035: Missouri has no NFL team. Indiana has two teams. Two teams now play in L.A. Eighteen teams play home games under a roof.And the state of New York still only has one NFL team.My weekly uniform thoughtsWe get a breather from the NFL Rivalries uniforms this week before they have their finale in Week 18 when the 49ers put theirs on against the Seahawks. I actually think they have been mostly OK, and I appreciate the concept the NFL is introducing after copying what MLB and NBA have done.One final uniform note as the regular season is about to conclude: teams can only wear their primary uniforms in the playoffs and Super Bowl. So any alternates or throwbacks… those won't see the field in the postseason. The league still wants the teams to look like themselves in the postseason, and I don't know that we will see that changing any time soon.A PSA if you're waiting for the Week 18 scheduleIt may not be until Monday evening that we know the full Week 18 schedule of games. I checked in on this Friday and got that news back. The goal for the league is to have the entire slate figured out post-Sunday Night Football, and that has been done in the past. But the result of Rams-Falcons Monday night game could have Week 18 implications that impact the final week's schedule.I think, at the very least, we will know by Sunday night who is playing in the two Saturday games that the league hopes will have some seeding drama surrounding it. If the Steelers or Panthers don't clinch their respective divisions this weekend, a win-or-go-home scenario probably places that game into the Sunday night slot regardless of whatever the Rams do on Monday.\n            ",

The Under has hit in four straight Clemson games, while the Tigers were 8-4 to the Under this season. Stars from both side of the ball are missing, but Penn State's losses on the offensive line could be particularly detrimental to the Nittany Lions' ability to move the ball. The model has PSU quarterback Ethan Grunkemeyer passing for fewer than 170 yards. Clemson, meanwhile, is missing a lot at receiver and on the O-line. The model projects 46 combined points as the Under hits nearly 60% of the time. The model also says one side of the spread hits well over 50% of the time. You can see the model's pick at SportsLine.  So who wins Penn State vs. Clemson, and which side of the spread hits in well over 50% of simulations? Visit SportsLine now to see which side of the Penn State vs. Clemson spread to jump on, all from the advanced model that's simulated this game 10,000 times, and find out.\n            ",

The schedule is stacked once again this year as fanbases are afforded the opportunity to see their teams in action one more time before the attention turns to the 2026 season. The bowl schedule kicked off Saturday, Dec. 13 and goes all the way until Jan. 2. The College Football Playoff carries us from there to Jan. 19, when two teams will vie for a national championship in Miami Gardens, Florida. CBS will once again broadcast the Tony the Tiger Sun Bowl. Kick is set for 2 p.m. on Dec. 31 in El Paso, Texas. Additionally, Dec. 27 is one of the most stacked days of the year as eight bowl games will take place on that day, including the Pop-Tarts Bowl, Texas Bowl and Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl Presented By Gin & Juice By Dre and Snoop (yes, that's its official name). \nBelow is a detailed look at the complete schedule for the 2025-26 college football bowl season, including dates, locations and TV channels.

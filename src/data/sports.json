They enter Super Bowl LX with a 16-1 record over their last 17 games, which is not a record that even Seattle can measure up to. New England has incredible balance, ranking second in points scored and fourth in points allowed, with the offense specifically standing out. Drake Maye combines both efficiency with a big-play ability as he leads the league in both completion percentage and yards per pass attempt. Meanwhile, the defense is playing its best entering Super Bowl Sunday as New England has given up one or fewer touchdowns in each of its last five games. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Seahawks can coverIt's hard to find any holes with Seattle, including in regard to the spread, as it has both the most covers and the best cover percentage of the regular plus postseason. The Seahawks are the only NFL team to rank in the top three in both scoring offense and scoring defense, and just five teams had more takeaways in the regular season. Mike Macdonald's crew also boasts top-10 rankings on both the ground and thru the air, but the defense is the star of this team. Seattle leads the NFL in points allowed, third-down defense, yards per rush allowed and yards per pass attempt allowed while ranking second in yards per play given up and rushing touchdowns allowed. No. 1 scoring defenses, like what Seattle has, also have a great history in this game, with a 14-4 all-time Super Bowl record. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Seahawks vs. Patriots picksSportsLine's model has simulated Patriots vs. Seahawks 10,000 times and is going Under on the total, projecting 44 combined points.

    "body": "\n        The first of two regular-season rivalry matchups between Michigan and Michigan State was all the more heated because of the teams' battle for the Big Ten title and status as two of the top 10 teams in the nation. Michigan coach Dusty May argued that those tensions went a touch too far in the No. 3 Wolverines' 83-71 win over the No. 7 Spartans last Friday night, accusing Michigan State of multiple \"very dangerous\" plays.Among the incidents in question was a play in which Spartans guard Jeremy Fears Jr. clipped Wolverines star Yaxel Lendeborg with his right foot. May pushed back on the assessment that it was an \"apparent\" trip and quipped, \"it wasn't an illusion.\"\n\"I think there were several plays that were very dangerous,\" May said on Monday. \"I am incredibly proud of our guys for the responses they had to some of those situations. Incredibly proud for their self-control, their restraint and their impulse control. I'll leave it at that. But they're not isolated incidents.\"Physical play is an expectation in marquee matchups, and even more so when two bitter rivals are involved, but May's perspective is that the Spartans crossed the line on more than just one occasion.\"The film is there,\" May said. \"40 minutes of it. It's not hard to find.\"\nMichigan State's Tom Izzo caught wind of May's accusations. Three days removed from his third loss of the season, the Hall of Famer brushed off his rival coach's comments, chalked the game's physicality up to the heat of the battle and turned his attention to Wednesday's trip to Minnesota.\"I thought there were a couple of plays the other way, too, like jumping into a guy and getting a foul when it was a complete joke,\" Izzo said. \"This is what it's supposed to be. And you know what, Michigan's over. I'm moving on to Minnesota. No insult to you. I don't care what Dusty says. I don't care what they say.\"There were some things Jeremy did I addressed. Him and their point guard were going at it pretty good. That's what happens in games like this. If anybody did anything dirty, tell him to call me, and I would be more than happy to address it. If it was physical play, that's the way that game's always going to be.\"May said that he has not reached out to Izzo about the plays he labeled as dangerous.\nThe Wolverines and Spartans will close their two-leg rivalry series in the regular-season finale on March 8. Michigan will host the second half of the home-and-home.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        James Harden is working with the Los Angeles Clippers to find a trade before Thursday's 3 p.m. ET deadline, according to ESPN. The two sides are aligned and working with interested teams, potentially setting up the 11-time All-Star and 2018 NBA MVP to play for his sixth NBA team in the very near future.Harden has had a stellar year all things considered. He's averaging around 25 points and eight assists per game, maintaining the All-Star-caliber performance he gave the Clippers last season. The only problem has been that the Clippers simply haven't been as good as a team as they were a year ago. They've since fought back into the postseason picture after their 6-21 start, but that hole was so deep that the Clippers likely don't have a realistic chance of making a deep playoff run in the Western Conference.Harden, perhaps the most accomplished player in the NBA not to have a championship ring, likely wants to go somewhere that he feels would give him a chance to compete in the twilight of his career. Harden has the right to veto any trade, so he can be picky about his next home. So let's go over three possible destinations for Harden as the Clippers sift through possible deals.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Cleveland CavaliersSports Illustrated reported Monday that the Clippers and Cavaliers have had advanced discussions on a James Harden-for-Darius Garland swap. On the surface, the deal makes very little sense for the Cavaliers. Harden is 10 years Garland's senior. Though not quite as outlandish, the obvious comparison would be to Dallas trading Luka Dončić a season ago for Anthony Davis, who is six years older than him.\nThe more you think about this one, the more sense it seemingly makes. Garland has been fairly injury prone throughout his career. He played 70 games for the first time last season, and then he proceeded to struggle throughout the playoffs due to a toe injury. That toe injury cost him games early in the season and limited his effectiveness when he has been available. He hasn't played since Jan. 14. He is owed two more years of max money and becomes extension-eligible over the summer. If the Cavaliers don't feel comfortable playing him, a trade is inevitable.But most trades would hurt this season's roster. The Hawks just had to trade Trae Young in a cap dump. The Cavaliers hope to compete for a championship this season, but the league by and large isn't interested in small guards. Therefore, Cleveland's best bet for a somewhat fair return would likely involve trading Garland for a different guard. Ja Morant can't shoot, so he's an absolute nonstarter for Cleveland. LaMelo Ball may have been in rumors earlier in the season, but the Hornets are rolling now. There just weren't many options. Enter Harden.While Harden obviously isn't a long-term play, he'd represent an upgrade over the version of Garland they've had this season at least. He is one of the very few players in all of basketball they could trade Garland for without making this season's roster worse. Sure, if Cleveland had acted sooner on Garland, things might be different. But any fantasies of, say, a Trey Murphy trade have long passed. This is what's on the table for Cleveland. The Cavaliers might be able to trade Garland for draft compensation, but doing so would surely involve taking back bad salary. This trade carries long-term risk, but in the short term, it keeps Cleveland in the hunt.\nWould Harden, given his Los Angeles roots, be all that happy in Cleveland? It's hard to say. It famously worked wonders for J.R. Smith, who thrived as a Cavalier because, in his words, \"There's nothing, there's no going out, there's no late nights. There's video games, basketball and basketball.\" Maybe Harden could similarly benefit. If he wants to compete for a title, moving East usually makes that easier, and the Cavaliers have a championship-ready roster.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Houston RocketsThis wouldn't be the first time Harden tried to get back to Houston. There were rumors of a possible return throughout the 2022-23 season, when he was playing for the Philadelphia 76ers. The Rockets instead elected to use their cap flexibility to sign Fred VanVleet as their point guard, putting Harden in a bind. He had nowhere to go in free agency, so he was forced to pick up his option in Philadelphia and force a trade to Los Angeles.Well, things have changed. VanVleet was great for Houston, but he tore his ACL before the season. The Rockets lost another key player in Steven Adams to an ankle injury recently, giving them $38 million in dead salary burning a hole in their pocket this season. VanVleet has the right to veto a trade, but Los Angeles would likely appeal to him given the presence of former teammate Kawhi Leonard and the clean books the Clippers can use to pay him longer-term if they so choose. Harden makes just over $39 million. Houston struggles to generate half-court offense. That's Harden's speciality. The Rockets are loaded with defenders to protect him on that end of the floor. He'd even be reuniting with former teammate Kevin Durant for a second time following their brief partnership in Brooklyn and longer one in Oklahoma City.\nHouston declined its last chance at Harden. Would the Rockets feel differently now? He's hardly a fit for Ime Udoka's defense-first style, but they may not be quite as picky with a real title shot on the line and few in-season options. Would Houston give up meaningful draft capital to get this done? The Clippers aren't running a charity, after all. If Garland is on the table for them, the Rockets would have to put real draft value on the table to match that.There are hurdles here, but you'd imagine that if Harden has his choice, he'd probably love to get back to Houston. The Rockets turned the haul they got for him in 2021 into a full-fledged contender, and now Harden could potentially get back there right in time for them to fully enjoy the spoils of that rebuild.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Minnesota TimberwolvesMinnesota doesn't have the obvious one-for-one player to swap with the Clippers that the Cavaliers have, and it doesn't have the same nostalgic and logistical appeal that Houston has. But the Timberwolves have one of the NBA's most aggressive general managers in Tim Connelly. If he wants Harden and Harden wants the Timberwolves, he'll find a way to make it possible.\nPoint guard has been an issue for Minnesota since Mike Conley began to decline. The Wolves have explored lesser players like Coby White, but Harden's playmaking would pair very well with Anthony Edwards as a scorer and all of the defense and athleticism Minnesota has assembled. Minnesota would have to send out one or two of its expensive role players to make a deal work financially. The easiest path would be Julius Randle, recent No. 8 pick Rob Dillingham and one minimum salary in exchange for Harden. That would conveniently leave the Clippers with 16 players, forcing them to waive Chris Paul and allow him to try to find a new home for the rest of the season.\n        \n            \n                Giannis Antetokounmpo mock trades: How Knicks, Warriors, more could entice Bucks with wild multi-team deals\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe major holdup here, though, is that the Timberwolves are currently pursuing Giannis Antetokounmpo.

    "body": "\n        The Seattle Mariners are acquiring All-Star infielder/outfielder Brendan Donovan from the St. Louis Cardinals in a three-team trade that also involves the Tampa Bay Rays, ESPN reports. Switch-pitcher Jurrangelo Cijntje is headed back from Seattle to St. Louis and the Rays are expected to get third baseman Ben Williamson from the Mariners. The Cardinals will also receive 2023 first-round draft pick Tai Peete from the Mariners and outfielder Colton Ledbetter and a compensatory draft pick from the Rays. None of the involved clubs has yet announced the trade. Mariners receive: UTL Brendan DonovanRays receive: 3B Ben WilliamsonCardinals receive: SHP Jurrangelo Cijntje, OF Tai Peete, OF Colton Ledbetter, two compensatory draft picksDonovan, who's going into his age-29 season in 2026, is coming off his first career All-Star selection this past season. His best position is second base, and he can also man first, third, and left, and cover shortstop in limited doses. At the plate, Donovan put up an OPS+ of 119 this past season, and that figure is right in line with his career mark of 117 across parts of four MLB campaigns. Furthermore, there's cause to believe he may have found a higher level with the bat in 2025. Through the end of May, Donovan boasted a wOBA of .373 and backed it up with expected wOBA of .370. In June, though, an MRI on Donovan's ailing left toe turned up a sprained capsule in the joint. Donovan toughed it out, but the injury cascaded throughout his lower half, messed up his swing mechanics, and sapped his production. The Mariners are no doubt hoping he's able to rediscover and sustain that higher level moving forward. Donovan won't hit free agency until after the 2027 season.\n        \n            \n                Brendan Donovan trade grades: Mariners find obvious fit, Cardinals finish offseason teardown with biggest move\n                \n                    R.J. Anderson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHe'll slot into a lineup that includes All-Star slugger Cal Raleigh, Julio Rodríguez, Josh Naylor and Randy Arozarena. The Mariners won the AL West in 2025 with a 90-72 record, three games ahead of the Houston Astros, before losing in the ALCS to the Toronto Blue Jays.From the Cardinals' standpoint, the trade of Donovan is in many ways the capstone on an offseason that's seen them commit fully to a rebuild under first-year president of baseball operations Chaim Bloom. Earlier in the winter, Bloom and the Cardinals in a pair of deals sent right-hander Sonny Gray and first baseman/former catcher Willson Contreras to the Red Sox and then offloaded veteran third baseman Nolan Arenado to the Diamondbacks. In each deal, the Cardinals added young pitching to an organization that prior to Bloom's takeover was starved for velocity and swing and miss. As well, ownership in each of those three deals included significant cash in order improve the return. That was especially the case in the Arenado swap. As for the Donovan trade, it not only adds young talent to an improving farm system but also fully clears the decks for top prospect JJ Wetherholt in 2026. He's now the favorite to open the 2026 season as the Cardinals' starting second baseman.\nCijntje, headlining the return for St. Louis, was Seattle's first-round pick in 2024. CBS Sports' R.J. Anderson recently ranked him the No. 7 prospect in the AL West, crediting a \"sneaky good right-handed fastball as well as a swing-and-miss breaker that ought to result in a middle-of-the-rotation future,\" but warned that his best future almost certainly involves pitching exclusively as a right-hander.Peete, also headed to the Cardinals, spent all of 2025 in High A, hitting .217/.288/.404 in 125 games.Williamson, headed south to the Rays, made his major-league debut in 2025, hitting .253/.294/.310 in 85 games for the Mariners.\nLedbetter hit .265/.337/.378 in Double A last season.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell held his annual state of the NFL press conference Monday from the Bay Area, the site of Super Bowl LX.Goodell, who is near the end of his 20th season as commissioner, touched on a number of topics, including the future of the league's international schedule, a potential increase to the regular-season slate, Bill Belichick's reported exclusion from this year's Pro Football Hall of Fame class and Giants co-owner Steve Tisch's inclusion in the latest release of the \"Epstein Files\" regarding convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Here's a rundown of some of the main topics Goodell addressed with the assembled media.International scheduleGoodell said the NFL will play nine games overseas in 2026, including a return to Mexico City in December. Earlier in the day, the league revealed that the New Orleans Saints will serve as the home team in the first-ever regular-season game played in Paris.\nThe nine international games in 2026 mark an increase from the seven the league played overseas in 2025. Goodell said his goal is to reach 16 international games per season, with every team playing at least one game abroad.\"We're getting great reactions from our teams,\" Goodell said. \"They all want to play. Our players loved it. One of the greatest things from last season was talking to our players and our coaches about how proud they were to be there and talk about the game to help globalize the game. They felt like ambassadors, and they enjoyed the experience, and that's really part of it.\"\n        \n            \n                NFL announces return to Mexico with International Series Game in Mexico City for next three seasons\n                \n                    Shanna McCarriston                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSteve Tisch in the 'Epstein Files' \"I would say that absolutely, we are going to look at all the facts,\" Goodell said. \"We're going to look at the context. We're going to try to understand that, and we'll see how that falls under the policy. But I think we take one step at a time. Let's get to facts first.\"\nA follow-up asked whether the NFL will investigate Tisch's involvement in the files and whether Goodell is concerned about more NFL figures being named.\"We'll continue to follow any of the facts that come up,\" he said, \"and we'll determine whether we open an investigation based on those facts.\"\n        \n            \n                Steve Tisch in Jeffrey Epstein files: Emails show sex offender scouted women for New York Giants co-owner\n                \n                    Cody Nagel                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBill Belichick's Hall of Fame exclusion\"That's a Hall of Fame career, but there's a decision-making process here, and it's a timing issue,\" Goodell said. \"There are a lot of people who are deserving of this, so I think that's something that the media will have to make that determination on as they go. But there's a lot of people who want to be in that Hall of Fame, and Bill Belichick deserves to be in that Hall of Fame too.\"\nGoodell made it clear that the NFL and the Pro Football Hall of Fame are separate entities. He also brushed off a question about whether he feels responsible for Belichick's exclusion after he fined Belichick and the Patriots for their role in Spygate, which was reportedly one of the things that kept Belichick out of the Hall of Fame this year.\n        \n            \n                How did Bill Belichick get snubbed? Inside the Hall of Fame vote, who backed him and what may have happened\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLack of diversity hiringGoodell acknowledged that more work needs to be done to improve diversity in hiring. Of the 10 head coaching vacancies recently filled, only one went to a minority candidate (new Titans head coach Robert Saleh). No head coaching openings were filled by a Black candidate.Of the NFL's 32 head coaches, only three -- Todd Bowles, DeMeco Ryans and Aaron Glenn -- are Black.\nDespite expanding the Rooney Rule in recent years and taking other steps to address the issue, the league continues to face challenges in that area. Goodell said he will keep working to find solutions to one of the NFL's biggest problems.Goodell also defended the Rooney Rule, which has faced criticism for years. Established in 2003 and named after former Steelers owner Dan Rooney, the rule requires teams to interview at least two external minority and/or female candidates for head coach and general manager vacancies, as well as one for various coordinator positions.\"I think the Rooney Rule has been seen as a positive by our clubs,\" Goodell said, \"by giving them an opportunity to look at a diverse set of candidates. They make the choice ultimately, but I think it's shown them the value to look at talent where you might not know it, or you may not see it.\"\n\"We're in a competitive league. ... We have 10 openings this year. Teams are trying to get the coach that they think can win. So I think taking the time pressure off of that is one of the things we focus on as a league ... to give them that time so they can make a really good decision independently, but one that is based on being able to look at a diversity of candidates. I think that only benefits the NFL.\"Regular-season expansionGoodell said adding a game to the regular-season schedule \"is not a given.\" The league expanded from 16 to 17 regular-season games in 2021, with a common assumption that an 18th game could be added in the next Collective Bargaining Agreement, which does not expire until 2031.\"We have not had any formal discussions about it, and frankly, very little with any informal conversations,\" he said. \"It is not a given that we'll do it. That is not something that we assume will happen. It is something that we want to talk about with the union leadership.\"\nGoodell listed several factors that could go into whether the league expands the regular season.\"It'll depend on a lot of factors, including safety of the game,\" he said. \"What other changes can we make ... from a safety standpoint, but also a competitive standpoint? Should we have two byes? What are the roster sizes? There are a number of issues that need to be discussed with the players.\"Honoring Paul TagliabueGoodell announced the league is creating the \"Paul Tagliabue Academic Achievement Award\" in honor of former NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, who died in November. \nThe award will go to an NFL player \"who demonstrates their desire to continue their education, to excel in that area, not for what they do on the field, but rather the work that they do.\" \"Bobby Wagner just went back and got his MBA and is playing world-class football,\" Goodell said. \"That's pretty amazing. And so we want to acknowledge that, celebrate that, but also celebrate Paul's legacy in a way I think he'd be proud.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The latest release of emails from the \"Epstein Files\" shows that convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein connected New York Giants co-owner and chairman Steve Tisch with multiple women while exchanging messages that included personal assessments of those women, according to documents made public by the U.S. Department of Justice.The 2013 communications were included in a release of more than three million Epstein-related records disclosed Friday. Epstein, who died by suicide in a federal jail cell while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges in August 2019, directly communicated with Tisch in the correspondence. Epstein appeared to be not only scouting women for Tisch but also facilitating introductions between women and Tisch. The two also exchanged follow-up commentary after meetings.In several email exchanges, Epstein and Tisch discussed whether women were \"pro or civilian\" or a \"working girl.\" Epstein sent descriptions of women's backgrounds, appearances and personalities, and in some cases, followed up with reports on such meetings. Tisch responded to a number of those messages.Tisch released a statement to Ralph Vacchiano of Fox Sports on his appearance in the Epstein files.\n\"We had a brief association where we exchanged emails about adult women, and in addition, we discussed movies, philanthropy, and investments,\" Tisch said. \"I did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island. As we all know now, he was a terrible person and someone I deeply regret associating with.\"Monday, on \"Opening Night\" of Super Bowl week, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell addressed how the league is proceeding regarding the findings.\"Absolutely, we are going to look at all the facts,\" Goodell said. \"We're gonna look at the context of [the communications.] We're gonna try to understand that, and we'll look at how that falls under the [NFL's personal conduct] policy.\"\nLater, Goodell said that the NFL has not opened an investigation.\"We'll continue to follow any of the facts that come up, and we'll determine if we open an investigation or not based on those facts.\"Tisch, a film producer responsible for the likes of \"Forrest Gump\" and \"American History X,\" took his role with the Giants in 2005. Epstein, a former banker, has faced charges of human trafficking, child sex offenses and serial rape.There are three primary periods of communication between Tisch and Epstein uncovered in the DOJ release.\nMay 2013Emails show Epstein communicating with Tisch, who was attending NFL meetings. After Tisch replied that he was, \"Still in NFL meeting,\" Epstein suggested arranging a meeting with a woman he identified as Russian. Tisch responded minutes later by asking, \"Is she fun?\" The exchange continued that afternoon.June 2013Emails show Tisch asking Epstein directly about specific women. In one exchange, Epstein described a woman as \"exotic,\" noting she spoke mostly French. Tisch replied by asking, \"Working girl?\" Epstein responded, \"Never.\"In a separate exchange, Tisch asked, \"Is my present in NYC?\" Epstein replied, \"Yes.\" Tisch followed up the next morning, asking, \"Can I get my surprise to take me to lunch tomorrow?\"In another exchange, Epstein described a woman in explicit terms, noting she had a \"10 ass,\" and encouraged Tisch to contact her. Tisch replied, \"Thanks Jeffrey,\" and asked about another woman, inquiring as to whether she was \"pro or civilian?\" Epstein responded that she was a \"civilian,\" adding further personal commentary.Epstein sent messages offering detailed commentary after meetings had taken place. In one follow-up, Epstein wrote that Tisch \"did very well,\" adding that the woman was \"a little freaked by the age difference\" and advising him to \"go slow.\" Epstein also referenced attempting to influence her not to return to Ukraine, writing that \"having her crying worked.\" Tisch replied, \"Nice report … Funny comment on crying!!!\"September 2013Emails show social exchanges between Epstein and Tisch tied to the Giants. Tisch offered Epstein two tickets to his suite for a game and invited him to attend other games during the season. Epstein, in turn, invited Tisch to visit him on his private island in the Caribbean, though the emails do not indicate whether Tisch accepted.In another exchange, Epstein wrote to Tisch that he was \"happy to have you as a new but … shared interest friend.\"In 1991, Tisch's family purchased a 50% stake in the Giants franchise. He has accepted the Vince Lombardi Trophy on behalf of the organization following Super Bowl victories after the 2007 and 2011 seasons. His brother, Jonathan Tisch, serves as the team's treasurer.The DOJ has said the release of communications involving Epstein is part of an effort to make previously undisclosed materials public, noting that a person's inclusion in the documents does not, by itself, indicate criminal conduct. The department has come under fire for the delayed release of these files as it missed a Dec. 19, 2025, deadline established by the Epstein Files Transparency Act, as passed by the U.S. House of Representatives.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Seattle Mariners, St. Louis Cardinals, and Tampa Bay Rays reportedly agreed to a massive three-team trade on Monday centered around veteran utility player Brendan Donovan. In total, five players and a draft pick were moved as part of the swap, including third baseman Ben Williamson and former first-round draft picks Jurrangelo Cijntje and Tai Peete.As is the case whenever a notable trade happens during Major League Baseball's offseason, I'm here to provide analysis on each of the players and to judge how the teams fared. That analysis is then reduced to bite-size in the form of a letter grade -- that part is (by far) the least important of the exercise.Before we get to the analysis, here's a look at the trade again in its entirety:Mariners receive: UTL Brendan DonovanRays receive: 3B Ben WilliamsonCardinals receive: SHP Jurrangelo Cijntje, OF Tai Peete, OF Colton Ledbetter, two compensatory draft picksLet's proceed.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Mariners grade: BJust last week, three members of our baseball staff predicted Donovan would end up on the Mariners before spring training started. Sometimes, player-team fits are too obvious to actually happen. That looked like it might end up being the case here, with Donovan's tenure in St. Louis stretching deeper into the offseason than most would have expected back in November. That's life for you.The 29-year-old Donovan is a compelling fit for the Mariners because of his offensive track record and his defensive versatility. In four big-league seasons, he's yet to produce an OPS+ below 114. Last year's Mariners club, a 90-win team that almost won the pennant, had just four players clear that mark in more than 300 trips to the plate. Donovan's offensive game is built around discipline and contact. He's comfortable working at-bats and he's connected on more than 90% of the in-zone swings he's taken as a big-league player. When he puts a ball in play, it's usually on a line and often classified as being hit hard. That's a good combination, and he should continue to find success despite now playing his home games in the least friendly offensive environment in the sport for left-handed batters, per Statcast.\nDefensively, Donovan has ample experience across the diamond, with most of his recent burn coming at second base or in left field. The Mariners have shed multiple options at the hot corner this winter (Williamson in this deal and Eugenio Suárez through free agency), so they may prefer to deploy him at third base most days, depending on how they fill out the remainder of their roster.\nDonovan is under team control through the 2027 season, which helps explain why the Mariners had to give up Cijntje and Williamson to complete the deal. Seattle probably won't regret it in the long haul. The Mariners have shown a real talent for pitching development and they have another promising young infielder in the way in Colt Emerson. Add in Donovan's immediate impact on a club that may again compete for the pennant and this would be a likable trade without the other pieces.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Cardinals grade: ACijntje, 22, was the 15th pick in the 2024 draft. CBS Sports just ranked him as the 44th-best prospect in the minors. Here's the extent of his writeup:\nCijntje, best known for being a switch-pitcher who can clear 90 mph with either arm, was Seattle's first-round pick in 2024. He reached Double-A in his first full professional season despite some underwhelming numbers that make it clear his future is exclusively as a right-hander. Indeed, he surrendered a .618 OPS and recorded a nearly 20% strikeout-minus-walk rate throwing righty, as opposed to 1.117 OPS and more walks than strikeouts as a lefty. Cijntje will be just dandy when and if he gives up on the novelty act: he has a sneaky good right-handed fastball as well as a swing-and-miss breaker that ought to result in a middle-of-the-rotation future. Cijntje joins a vastly improved group of Cardinals pitching prospects. Dating back to last summer, they've now drafted Liam Doyle and added Cijntje, Hunter Dobbins, Richard Fitts, Yhoiker Fajardo, Brandon Clarke, Blake Aita, and Jack Martinez to the organization through trades. Clearly they had a desire to upgrade their pitching depth without having to pay for it on the free-agent market.Peete, 20, was the 30th pick in the 2023 Draft. He's a lefty-swinging outfielder with dynamic power-speed upside, but usability continues to be an issue -- specifically with respect to a nearly 33% whiff rate. Last year in High-A, he hit .217/.288/.404 with 19 home runs and 25 stolen bases in 125 games. Peete's game is centered on pulling and lifting the ball. If he can make contact a little more frequently, he has a chance to make an impact at the big-league level. Ledbetter, 24, was the 55th pick in the 2023 Draft by way of Mississippi State. He spent last season in Double-A, hitting .265/.337/.378 with seven home runs and 37 stolen bases. Ledbetter, a left-handed swinger, has struggled with same-handed pitching throughout his professional career. He's a capable athlete who can play across the outfield, though he's best deployed in a corner spot. Add those sentences together and you have a player who is probably topping out as a spare outfielder.The two compensatory pick should check in around Nos. 68 and 72. In total, that gives the Cardinals five picks in the top 72 overall in the 2026 Draft.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Rays grade: BWilliamson, 25, is a former second-round pick who batted .253/.294/.310 (76 OPS+) with a home run and five stolen bases in his 85-game introduction to the majors. He's a fantastic third baseman who would likely be earmarked for a future Gold Glove Award if he could hit more. As it stands, Williamson lacks the swing path and bat speed to hit for power. His approach is also mismatched: he offers less within the zone and more outside of the zone than the league-average player. \nWithout any gains on the offensive end -- and without a positional switch to shortstop -- Williamson's game probably looks something like Ke'Bryan Hayes'. There are worse fates to experience.\n            ",

So far, the NFL has announced nine international games, including a return to Mexico.Three games will be played in Mexico, with all taking place at Mexico City's Estadio Banorte over the next three years, the announcement stated. The next game will be held in Mexico City in December of 2026, although the teams that will compete in that game have yet to be announced.This marks the first time since 2022 that the NFL will play a regular season game in Mexico. Games were played at Estadio Banorte in 2005, 2016, 2017, 2019 and 2022.\"We are delighted to bring regular‑season NFL games back to Mexico City beginning in 2026, reaffirming our deep and long‑standing connection with fans across the country,\" NFL Mexico director general Arturo Olivé said. \"Estadio Banorte has hosted some incredibly memorable moments in our international history, and returning here underscores our commitment to growing the sport at every level in the market.\"\nMexico was the site of the first ever regular season game outside of the United States and was referred to as \"Fútbol Americano.\" In that game, the Arizona Cardinals defeated the San Francisco 49ers, 31-14, at Estadio Azteca on Oct. 2, 2005. An NFL record 103,467 fans attended the matchup.London was the first city to hold NFL games as part of the International Series and was the only city involved in the program from 2007 to 2015. The league went from one game a season in London to multiple and in 2016 expanded to Mexico City, returning to Estadio Azteca.\nThe other international games in the 2026 season are in Melbourne, Australia; Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; Munich, Germany; Madrid, Spain; Paris, France and three games in London, England. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Two teams going in opposite directions will meet as part of Monday's NBA schedule as the Minnesota Timberwolves visit the Memphis Grizzlies. The Wolves (31-19) have won four in a row, including a Saturday victory over the Grizzlies in Memphis by a 131-114 score. The defeat was Memphis' (18-29) sixth in a row as the Grizzlies are on their longest losing streak in seven years. Anthony Edwards (back) and Julius Randle (thumb) are questionable for Minnesota, while Jaren Jackson Jr. (quad) is probable for Memphis.Tipoff is at 7:30 p.m. ET from FedExForum in Memphis, Tenn.

    "body": "\n        The coaching carousel this offseason has been the most entertaining merry-go-round of NFL drama in years. The Baltimore Ravens fired John Harbaugh after 18 seasons, Mike Tomlin stepped down after 19 years with the Pittsburgh Steelers, and the Buffalo Bills parted ways with Sean McDermott following their divisional-round loss to the Denver Broncos.With new head coaches come new staffs, and sometimes the coordinator hires can be just as important as the top job. Just look at what happened with the Detroit Lions last year. Some of these assistants will be called upon to lead their side of the ball, like Brian Flores with the Minnesota Vikings' defense or Klint Kubiak with the Seattle Seahawks' offense.There has been plenty of coordinator turnover over the past few weeks. Below, CBS Sports writers Jordan Dajani and Bryan DeArdo attempt to grade every coordinator hire from around the NFL.Remaining openingsOffensive coordinator (8): Cardinals, Bears, Raiders, Rams, Giants, Jets, Steelers, Seahawks\nDefensive coordinator (3): Cardinals, Browns, Raiders\n        \n            \n                NFL coaching grades are in: Cardinals sign Mike LaFleur, Raiders closing in on Klint Kubiak\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Offensive coordinator: Tommy ReesGrade: CDajani: The Atlanta Browns? Kevin Stefanski isn't exploring other offensive coordinator options, as he's bringing his OC with him to the Falcons. The former Notre Dame quarterback spent the past two years in Cleveland, working as a pass-game specialist and tight ends coach before earning a promotion to offensive coordinator in 2025.Stefanski handed off play-calling duties to Rees in the middle of last season, as Cleveland again struggled to find consistency at quarterback. Ultimately, the Browns finished third-worst in total offense (262.1 yards per game) and second-worst in scoring (16.4 points per game).Browns fans probably weren't too sad to lose Rees. Was the problem in Cleveland the coaching staff and play-calling? Or the personnel? We'll find out soon enough.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Offensive coordinator: Declan Doyle Grade: BDeArdo: Doyle, 29, was born the same year as the Ravens' inaugural season. Despite his youth, Doyle has already made three prior NFL coaching stops, including spending the 2025 season as the Bears' offensive coordinator. Before that, he spent four seasons as an offensive assistant in New Orleans before following Sean Payton to Denver, where he served as the Broncos' tight ends coach for two seasons.While he has already held the offensive coordinator title, the Baltimore position could be considered a promotion, as he will call plays for the first time (Ben Johnson calls the offensive plays in Chicago). That means the Ravens will have a defensive-minded, first-time head coach in Jesse Minter -- who recently said he will call the plays on defense -- paired with a first-time play-caller on offense.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Defensive coordinator: Anthony Weaver Grade: A+DeArdo: Baltimore hit a home run by hiring Weaver, whom many considered the best available defensive coordinator during this coaching cycle. The move looks even more impressive given how late it came in the process. The Ravens deserve extra credit for staying patient and waiting to see if Weaver would be available after he interviewed to become the Steelers' next head coach.\nFrom a historical standpoint, the 2000 Ravens' legendary defense had Marvin Lewis as its coordinator, and he enjoyed a highly successful career before becoming a head coach. Weaver -- a former Ravens pass rusher who played alongside Ray Lewis, Ed Reed and Terrell Suggs -- appears cut from the same cloth.Weaver got into coaching shortly after his playing career ended. He has enjoyed a lengthy run as a defensive line coach, including three seasons on John Harbaugh's staff in Baltimore. In Miami, Weaver led a Dolphins defense that ranked 10th in scoring in 2024. This past season, he got incredible production from linebackers Jordyn Brooks and Tyrel Dodson, along with pass rusher Bradley Chubb.\n        \n            \n                Ravens expected to hire Bears offensive coordinator Declan Doyle, 29, for same role in Baltimore\n                \n                    Will Backus                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Offensive coordinator: Pete Carmichael Jr. Grade: A-DeArdo: Carmichael makes perfect sense for the Bills and first-time head coach Joe Brady, who will continue to serve as Buffalo's offensive play-caller. In Carmichael, Brady is getting an experienced coach who worked closely with Drew Brees for 19 of his 20 seasons with the Chargers and Saints. Carmichael won a Super Bowl in 2009 as the Saints' offensive coordinator. Quarterback aside, Carmichael has been part of several successful rushing attacks featuring Hall of Famer LaDainian Tomlinson, Mark Ingram, and Alvin Kamara. \nFor the past two years, Carmichael served as a senior offensive assistant in Denver while helping mentor Bo Nix. He'll now get the chance to work with Josh Allen, the 2024 NFL MVP who continues to chase that elusive Super Bowl berth. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Defensive coordinator: Jim Leonhard Grade: A-Dajani: Sometimes big things come in small packages. That was true for Jim Leonhard the player, and it may be true for Jim Leonhard the coach. The Bills were the first NFL team to recognize him as a legitimate player, and now he returns to lead their defense.The 43-year-old has worked his way up from Wisconsin's defensive backs coach to defensive coordinator of the Bills. The Chargers and Ravens pursued him, but he chose to join Joe Brady's staff. Leonhard spent the past two seasons with the Broncos.\nAs the defensive backs coach in 2024, he helped cornerback Patrick Surtain II win Defensive Player of the Year. As the pass game coordinator in 2025, his Broncos unit ranked No. 2 in opponent completion percentage (57.8%) and No. 7 in passing yards allowed per game (187.2). Leonhard isn't an experienced play-caller, but he has clearly earned this opportunity.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Offensive coordinator: Travis SwitzerGrade: CDajani: Todd Monken is bringing in the former Ravens run game coordinator to work with Quinshon Judkins and Dylan Sampson. The 33-year-old Switzer is a first-time offensive coordinator but has ties to Ohio as a former offensive lineman with the Akron Zips. He has never coached for another organization, so it's tough to make heads or tails of this addition. Ideally, Monken will call plays and oversee the passing attack while Switzer oversees what happens on the ground.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Defensive coordinator: Christian ParkerGrade: BDeArdo: If you take Cooper DeJean's word for it, the Cowboys found a gem in the 34-year-old Parker, who helped the Eagles win a Super Bowl as part of veteran defensive coordinator Vic Fangio's staff. The fact that Dallas is prying a rising coach away from a division rival only makes the move look even better.Parker has a diverse background, having already served on coaching staffs in Philadelphia, Denver and Green Bay. He cut his teeth as a quality control coach before rising to defensive backs coach and passing game coordinator.Parker may blossom into the NFL's next elite coordinator, but the Cowboys are taking a risk, especially with head coach Brian Schottenheimer being an offensive-minded leader. That said, it's a risk worth taking for a franchise desperate to reach its first conference title game since 1995.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Offensive coordinator: Davis WebbGrade: A-Dajani: Not shocking to anyone, but the Broncos are promoting former passing game coordinator Davis Webb to offensive coordinator, replacing Joe Lombardi. It's a win in the sense that Webb was a popular name this cycle when it came to other openings around the league.While he's only 31, Webb figures to be a legitimate head-coaching candidate in the next hiring cycle, especially if he takes play-calling duties away from Sean Payton, something that could reportedly happen.The former quarterback has been coaching for just three seasons but has experienced a meteoric rise. Webb also has a good relationship with Bo Nix, so this is a nice move for Denver.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Offensive coordinator: Drew PetzingGrade: C+DeArdo: This is definitely an under-the-radar hire for the Lions, but Petzing may have been the best available offensive coordinator who wasn't in the mix for a head-coaching job.While he's only 36, Petzing has 16 years of coaching experience, including 12 in the NFL. He spent five years with the Vikings before working three seasons on Kevin Stefanski's staff in Cleveland. Petzing served as Kyler Murray's quarterbacks coach in 2022 before being named the Cardinals' offensive coordinator in 2023.Late in the 2023 season, Petzing's offense spearheaded Arizona's upset win over the Steelers in Pittsburgh, a game that included 105 rushing yards and two touchdowns from James Conner. Injuries to Conner and Murray played a major role in Petzing's offense never reaching its full potential. He'll now get a fresh start in Detroit with an offense that isn't short on skill players.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Defensive coordinator: Jonathan GannonGrade: A-Dajani: The social media reaction to this hiring was puzzling. Packers fans know Gannon is being hired as a defensive coordinator, not a head coach, right?The Cardinals fired Gannon after he went 15-36 over three seasons, but he was widely regarded as one of the league's best coordinators during his time with the Eagles. During Philadelphia's run to Super Bowl LVII, the defense ranked in the top eight in points allowed per game, total yards allowed per game and sacks with Gannon calling plays.This could be a nice fit for Micah Parsons. Maybe Gannon wasn't the best lead man, but he's an experienced defensive mind who has held this role before.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Offensive coordinator: Eric BieniemyGrade: B-DeArdo: Like an old sitcom trying to relive its glory days, the Chiefs are clearly hoping Bieniemy can help them get back to what they once were.From a familiarity standpoint, this makes a ton of sense. While his tough love coaching style isn't for everyone, Bieniemy clearly has a strong working relationship with Patrick Mahomes, and that's a big deal. If Bieniemy can help Mahomes return to MVP form, that's what matters most.That said, a coach is only as good as his players. Travis Kelce will be 37 next season, and Mahomes will be 31. Kansas City also doesn't have anyone who can replicate what Tyreek Hill gave them during their first Super Bowl run. In short, Bieniemy will have to adjust to what the Chiefs are now, not what they used to be.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Offensive coordinator: Mike McDanielGrade: A+Dajani: Mike McDaniel was the belle of the ball in this year's offensive coordinator cycle. Say what you want about McDaniel as a lead man, but he could be one of the best offensive coordinators in the NFL right away for the Chargers.In 2023, he used Tua Tagovailoa to power the league's No. 1 offense, as Miami averaged 401.3 total yards per game. Yes, that production eventually fell off, but the way McDaniel schemed up touches for his running backs really stood out. Remember when Raheem Mostert led the NFL with 18 rushing touchdowns at 31 years old?And we all know the speedy De'Von Achane is one of the league's best weapons. His 5.62 yards per carry are the second-most by a running back in NFL history. Whether running the ball or throwing it, McDaniel knows how to create explosive plays. In fact, he's registered the seventh-most team yards per play (5.78) among head coaches in the Super Bowl era.Imagine what he's going to be able to do with Justin Herbert and Omarion Hampton.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Defensive coordinator: Chris O'LearyGrade: A-DeArdo: Another exceptional hire for Jim Harbaugh, who brings O'Leary back to Los Angeles after he spent the 2025 season turning Western Michigan's defense into one of the nation's best units.O'Leary, who spent the 2024 season as the Chargers' safeties coach, presided over a Western Michigan defense that finished ninth in the FBS in scoring (17.4 points per game) and 19th in total net yards allowed per game (305.5). That success helped the Broncos go 10-4 en route to the program's fourth conference title.The 34-year-old O'Leary also had a successful six-year run at Notre Dame prior to coming to Los Angeles in 2024. That season, the Chargers led the NFL in scoring defense after allowing opponents to score on just 45% of their trips inside L.A.'s 20-yard line. Under O'Leary's watch, Chargers safety Derwin James Jr. earned his fourth Pro Bowl nod and second All-Pro selection.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Offensive coordinator: Bobby SlowikGrade: A-Dajani: Slowik deserves another chance after his stint with the Houston Texans. You'll remember he helped C.J. Stroud win Offensive Rookie of the Year in 2023, as the No. 2 overall pick posted the highest TD-to-INT ratio against winning teams in NFL history in his first season, including the playoffs (21-2). Stroud also became the youngest quarterback to win a playoff game in NFL history.However, Slowik failed to adjust and improve his scheme. The Texans offense ranked 12th in total yards (342.4 per game) and tied for 13th in points per game (22.2) in 2023, but slipped to 22nd in yards (319.7 per game) and 19th in scoring (21.9) in 2024, which led to his firing.After watching how Stroud has fared over the past two years, it looks like Slowik was the best offensive mind Houston had in the DeMeco Ryans era. After spending last season as the Dolphins' senior passing game coordinator, Slowik is back leading an offense.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Defensive coordinator: Sean DugganGrade: BDeArdo: As is often the case with head coaches who also handle play-calling duties, Jeff Hafley is bringing in a familiar face who can help manage other facets of the defense. In that vein, hiring Duggan makes sense.Duggan spent one season as a co-defensive coordinator in college (Boston College in 2023) and has just two years of NFL experience. He served as a Packers defensive assistant in 2024 before the team promoted him to linebackers coach in 2025. Last season, Duggan helped Quay Walker, Edgerrin Cooper and Isaiah McDuffie emerge as one of the NFL's most productive linebacker trios, combining for 338 tackles.In most situations, this hire wouldn't make much sense given Duggan's limited NFL and coordinator experience. But his familiarity with Hafley -- along with the fact that play-calling won't fall on his plate -- gives this the potential to be a solid hire.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Defensive coordinator: Dennard WilsonGrade: B+Dajani: At face value, hiring the former defensive coordinator of the Titans doesn't sound great. After all, the Giants' last defensive coordinator also came from Tennessee, and that didn't go so well. But Dennard Wilson is highly respected and has a strong connection to John Harbaugh.Wilson helped the Eagles reach Super Bowl LVII as a passing game coordinator and defensive backs coach, relying on Darius Slay, James Bradberry and C.J. Gardner-Johnson. He then went to Baltimore as the Ravens' defensive backs coach and watched that defense become the first team in NFL history to lead the league in points allowed per game (16.5), sacks (60) and takeaways (31).Wilson got his first shot as a defensive coordinator with the Titans in 2024, and his unit ranked second in total defense despite a 3-14 record. Tennessee slipped to 21st this past season, but Wilson was applauded for getting the most out of a banged-up group. Now, he lands in New York.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Defensive coordinator: Brian Duker Grade: C+DeArdo: This makes sense from a familiarity standpoint, as Duker and Jets head coach Aaron Glenn spent three years together on the Lions' coaching staff.Duker has never been a play-caller, so this hire likely indicates that Glenn will handle defensive play-calling for the Jets this season. That will give Duker a chance to manage other responsibilities on that side of the ball without the added burden of calling plays.It seems Glenn wanted someone he knows and trusts as he takes on his new role as defensive play-caller. If that was the goal, it's hard to be overly critical of the hire.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Offensive coordinator: Sean Mannion Grade: BDeArdo: Mannion, 33, has enjoyed a meteoric rise in the coaching ranks after retiring from the NFL less than two years ago. A former NFL quarterback, Mannion spent parts of the 2023 season of the Vikings' practice squad and served as Jared Goff's backup when the Rams went to the Super Bowl in 2018. Upon retiring, Mannion quickly joined the Packers staff as an offensive assistant. He was promoted to quarterbacks coach this past season and helped Jordan Love have arguably his best season since becoming Green Bay's starting quarterback. He also did a notable job with Malik Willis, who completed a whopping 85.7% of his throws across four games. Eagles fans should be encouraged with this hire based on what Mannion was able to do during his short time in Green Bay. The fact that Mannion is less than two years from playing himself should give him a unique perspective in terms of calling plays and seeing the game from a quarterback's viewpoint. \n        \n            \n                Eagles hire Sean Mannion as offensive coordinator after down year for Jalen Hurts, Philadelphia offense\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Defensive coordinator: Patrick Graham Grade: B+DeArdo: As an offensive-minded coach, it was important for Mike McCarthy to find an experienced defensive coordinator to lead the Steelers' defense. He was able to do that by hiring the 47-year-old Graham, who has already served as a defensive coordinator for the Dolphins, Giants and Raiders.During his second year with the Raiders in 2023, Graham helped the unit go from 26th to ninth in the NFL in points allowed. This past season, Las Vegas ranked 10th in the league in passing touchdowns allowed and fourth in average yards per carry allowed.In Pittsburgh, Graham will preside over a defense that has a good mix of older, proven veterans (Cam Heyward, T.J. Watt, Jalen Ramsey, Alex Highsmith and Patrick Queen) and young players who are still on the rise (Derrick Harmon, Nick Herbig and Joey Porter Jr.).It's safe to say -- from a personnel standpoint -- the 2026 Steelers defense will be Graham's best unit since he became a defensive coordinator in 2020.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Defensive coordinator: Raheem MorrisGrade: ADajani: I'm not sure the Falcons should have fired Raheem Morris this offseason. His team finished 2025 on a four-game winning streak, and the defense ended up in the top half of the league in yards allowed per game. Morris also got the most out of several rookie playmakers. Pass rusher James Pearce Jr. set a rookie franchise record with 10.5 sacks, while safety Xavier Watts recorded six takeaways -- tied for the third most by any player in the NFL this season.Morris captained a Rams defense that finished top 10 in both yards and points in 2023 before landing the Falcons job, and now he returns to the NFC West. Replacing someone like Robert Saleh won't be easy, but Morris is a veteran defensive leader capable of running the 49ers on that side of the ball.\n        \n            \n                49ers hiring Raheem Morris as defensive coordinator: Former Falcons coach replaces Robert Saleh\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Offensive coordinator: Zac RobinsonGrade: B+DeArdo: This has the potential to be a really good hire for the Buccaneers for several reasons.Robinson, 39, is familiar with Tampa Bay after facing the Bucs twice a year over the past two seasons as the Falcons' offensive coordinator. Perhaps more importantly, he has extensive knowledge of other defenses in the NFC South.In Atlanta, Robinson consistently put his best players in positions to succeed. Under his watch, Bijan Robinson became arguably the NFL's top running back while breaking the Falcons' single-season total yardage record. Wideout Drake London and Kyle Pitts also enjoyed considerable success in Robinson's offense.Consistency at quarterback was one of the biggest things that eluded Robinson during his time in Atlanta. Now, he'll get a chance to work with Baker Mayfield at a pivotal point in Mayfield's career.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Offensive coordinator: Brian DabollGrade: B+DeArdo: While his time as the Giants' head coach was largely disappointing, Daboll does have a strong background as an offensive coordinator, including a proven track record with young quarterbacks.Daboll worked exceptionally well with Josh Allen during their time together in Buffalo. In two years, Allen went from a struggling starter to one of the NFL's best quarterbacks.Daboll also got quite a bit out of Daniel Jones in New York. Jones helped lead the Giants to their first playoff win since Super Bowl XLVI, and Daboll also maximized the talents of Saquon Barkley before his departure.Daboll will now get a chance to mentor another young quarterback in Cam Ward, who played well during his rookie season despite less-than-ideal circumstances.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Defensive coordinator: Gus BradleyGrade: BDajani: Robert Saleh is going to call plays on the defensive side of the ball, but Gus Bradley is an experienced right-hand man for Tennessee's new head coach. Bradley spent last year as the 49ers' assistant head coach but has served as the defensive coordinator for three different NFL teams (Chargers, Raiders and Colts) and was the Jacksonville Jaguars' head coach for four seasons from 2013-16.Bradley's return to the AFC South doesn't exactly strike fear into the hearts of Tennessee's rivals, but the Titans now have Saleh as head coach, Brian Daboll as offensive coordinator, Bradley as defensive coordinator and John Fassel as special teams coordinator. That's a pretty solid staff.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Offensive coordinator: David BloughGrade: C-Dajani: This is a massive gamble for Dan Quinn. After an incredible 12-5 campaign in 2024, the Commanders finished 5-12 this past season. You can try to blame it on Jayden Daniels missing 10 starts, but he didn't look like a superstar in the games he did play, winning just two of them.With Kliff Kingsbury out, Washington moved questionably quickly to promote a 30-year-old former quarterback who has never called plays to lead the offense.I'm sure Daniels loves Blough, and he absolutely deserves a fair shot. But if he can't find a way to spark this offense right away, could Quinn lose his job? After watching one-third of the NFL change head coaches, I'm not ruling anything out.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Defensive coordinator: Daronte JonesGrade: BDajani: Daronte Jones is a Maryland native who returns to Washington after spending the past four seasons with the Vikings as their defensive backs coach and pass game coordinator. He's worked with defensive backs at a number of stops, including Nicholls State, UCLA, the Montreal Alouettes of the CFL, Hawaii, Wisconsin, the Miami Dolphins and Cincinnati Bengals. He also had a one-year stint as LSU's defensive coordinator in 2021.ESPN reported that Jones interviewed with at least five different teams for defensive coordinator openings, but Quinn was able to land him. While he's not exactly a household name, Jones has worked under Brian Flores, Vance Joseph and Mike Zimmer.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        One of the top events on the PGA Tour tees off on Thursday as the 2026 WM Phoenix Open unfolds at TPC Scottsdale (Stadium Course). Known for its raucous crowds, the WM Phoenix Open usually draws a great field, and this year is no exception.

He has only played this event twice, but he made the cut both times and finished 36th last year and 28th in 2024. Both times he shot above 70 in the first round, but rallied over the weekend, so if he can get off to a fast start at TPC Scottsdale this week, he'll have a chance to be in the mix on Sunday. See who else to pick here. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $200 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:How to make 2026 WM Phoenix Open picksThe model is also targeting three other longshots of +3000 or longer as top-10 contenders. You can only see the model's picks here. \nWho will win the 2026 WM Phoenix Open, and which longshots will stun the golfing world?

The Timberwolves have won four straight games, bouncing back from a five-game losing skid, and they are 31-19 on the season. Each of their most recent four wins has come by at least 12 points, winning by an average of 16.8 points per game. The Grizzlies (18-29) remain without Ja Morant (elbow), who could be traded this NBA Trade Deadline week, and they have lost six straight games. Each of their last four losses has come by at least eight points. Timberwolves stars Anthony Edwards (back) and Julius Randle (thumb) are questionable as injuries to watch, but the model still projects Minnesota to cover in 62% of simulations. Bet the Timberwolves to cover at DraftKings here:Clippers (-2.5) vs. 76ers (-105)The Clippers have been arguably the best team in the NBA since near Christmas, going 17-4 over their last 21 games after a 6-21 start to the season. They have won five straight and are 10-1 over their last 11 home games. Even with James Harden (personal) out on Sunday, the Clippers defeated the Suns, 117-93. Harden had 25 points and nine assists on Friday against Denver, and he's 16th in scoring (25.4 points per game) and third in assists (8.1). His being out in the front end of a Clippers back-to-back could raise his chances of playing Monday. Meanwhile, the 76ers go into this contest without star Paul George, who was hit with a 25-game suspension on Saturday for violating the NBA's anti-drug policy. The model projects the Clippers' winning ways to continue, projecting them to cover in 69% of simulations. Bet the Clippers at DraftKings here:Sacramento State (+1.5) vs. Weber State (-120)\"Familiar local face Mike Bibby had to throw out the blueprint for his first Sac State side when 6-11 UNLV transfer Bear Cherry went down with a leg injury in November. The Hornets, however, have made adjustments and sit mid-table in Big Sky into February after back-to-back wins over Montana State and Montana at the Nest,\" legendary SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall said. \"It's also worth noting those were only the third and fourth home games since Thanksgiving...all wins in Big Sky play. Bibby's transfer guards Prophet Johnson (via-Fairfield; 17.3 ppg) & Mikey Williams (via UCF; 16.9 ppg) combined for 45 ppg in those two wins. It's also revenge time for Sac State after Weber State got the Hornets in Ogden when hitting 51% from the floor on January 3.\" Bet Sacramento State at DraftKings here:\nWant more NBA and college basketball on Monday?You've seen some of the model's Monday best bets.

    "body": "\n        While the Week 9 college football schedule did not provide as many games between ranked teams, the updated AP Top 25 poll could see even more shakeup than the week before thanks to some impactful results throughout the rankings. By the end of Saturday, a total of six ranked teams took losses in Week 9, opening plenty of room for teams to move up on voters' ballots. That's going to benefit teams with gaudy win totals as we hit the final stretch of the season, as just avoiding a loss can be as beneficial as a signature win when it comes to rankings movement. That said, one of the most notable movements we're projecting is from a quality win featuring a top 10 team. Ole Miss went into Norman as an underdog against Oklahoma, yet the Rebels jumped out to an early lead and closed the game strong to emerge with an eight-point win to improve to 7-1 on the season. Since the only loss on the season is against Georgia, in Athens, it's unlikely Ole Miss can move higher than No. 5, but look for that voting points gap to close as a response to the Rebels gusty win in the rain. Elsewhere, we're monitoring whether Texas A&M will get any first-place votes after a dominant win against LSU in Death Valley as well as if Indiana's first-place vote count will improve following the second 50+ point win of the season against a conference opponent. The No. 1 team in the country, Ohio State, was off in Week 9, so while the Buckeyes have done nothing to give up ground, they also were unable to make the kind of statement win we saw from No. 2 and No. 3. \n        \n            \n                Bowl projections: Vanderbilt enters CFP bracket as SEC's fifth team, BYU flexes as new Big 12 frontrunner\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nOf course, with a half-dozen ranked teams losing, there is going to be some noticeable changes in the top 25 beyond shuffling inside the top 10. Some of the most dramatic changes will be in the back half of the rankings with teams benefiting from low loss counts to see big moves up either in the poll or breaking into the rankings after being unranked last week. \nHere's how we think the new AP Top 25 will look on Sunday after Week 9:1. Ohio State (Last week — 1): The Buckeyes were off in Week 9 and will be back in action next week against Penn State in Columbus. 2. Indiana (2): Earlier this week, Curt Cignetti described UCLA as a 3-0 team, and it seems clear that the Bruins had the Hoosiers' attention as though they were an undefeated foe. Indiana raced out to a 35-3 halftime lead and never let up in a 56-6 victory. 3. Texas A&M (3): A thunderous result in Baton Rouge could lead to some first-place votes going the way of Texas A&M, which is now 8-0 and staring down the possibility of an all-time season in College Station. The Aggies dominated LSU in all three phases on Saturday night, handing Brian Kelly just his second-ever loss under the lights at night in Tiger Stadium.  \n4. Alabama (4): The Crimson Tide got bailed out of a tough spot at South Carolina thanks in part to the defense delivering a huge turnover in the fourth quarter that set up the game-winning score. Alabama did not play its best game, but it rose to the occasion in the crunch time on both sides of the ball and escaped Columbia with a win. 5. Georgia (5): The Bulldogs were off in Week 9 and will be back in action next week against Florida in Jacksonville. 6. Ole Miss (8): Saturday's victory against Oklahoma in Norman could go down as one of the important wins of the season because it has totally flipped the postseason outlook for the Rebels and certainly has changed how they will be judged in the rankings. Labeled a slight underdog by the oddsmakers, Ole Miss overcame a second-half charge from the Sooners and scored the final nine points of the game to win 34-26. The win helps validate what we expect will be a very good record at the end of the season (7-1 for now) and keeps Ole Miss in the thick of the SEC title race.  \n7. Georgia Tech (7): There is a tough ceiling for voting points gap when it comes to upward movement, but the Yellow Jackets are continuing to pass every test put before them here in 2025. Down multiple starters, Georgia Tech rebounded from a slow start and walloped Syracuse by a 41-16 score. Haynes King totaled five touchdowns (three passing, two rushing) by the end of the rout, and Brent Key's team is now 8-0 on the season and 5-0 in ACC play. 8. Oregon (6): While Wisconsin was not threatening to win, Oregon's 21-7 victory against the Badgers was closer than expected for much of the evening. Voters won't penalize the Ducks for a double-digit win, but when it comes to tiebreakers among one-loss teams (or growing momentum for undefeated teams like Georgia Tech or BYU), this was a game that left the door open for challengers inside the top 10.  9. Vanderbilt (10): The best start since 1941 continues as Vanderbilt improved to 6-1 with a hard-fought 17-10 win against Missouri. A defensive battle from the start, the Commodores blew the game open with an 80-yard touchdown run from Makhilyn Young and then took advantage of a Missouri turnover for the game-winning score. \n10. BYU (11): The reluctance to boost BYU's ranking will be tested, because now the Cougars are 8-0 after in impressive rally and notable win at Iowa State. The Cyclones led by double-digits at two different points in the first half, but BYU flipped the game with turnovers, picking off Rocco Becht three times and returning one of them for a touchdown. It's unlikely BYU could jump Georgia Tech, but anyone else is susceptible to getting past by a Cougars team that just keeps finding ways to win.   11. Miami (9): The Hurricanes had less than a 100-point advantage on Vanderbilt and BYU, so any sways in momentum among the voters could lead to a shuffle. Considering Vanderbilt's ranked win, BYU improving to 8-0 and Miami getting off to a slow start (before eventually cruising to a win), it's possible some spots get traded around the edge of the top 10.  12. Notre Dame (12): The Fighting Irish were off in Week 9 and will be back in action next week at Boston College. \n13. Texas Tech (14): The Red Raiders needed a get-right win after a frustrating loss at Arizona State, and they drew the right opponent with Oklahoma State coming to Lubbock. It was all Texas Tech from the jump, starting with a 99-yard touchdown on the opening kickoff, and the Cowboys did not provide much resistance in the 42-0 win.  14. Tennessee (17): The Vols offense offered quite the response from last week's loss at Alabama, rolling up 504 yards of offense and 56 points against a Kentucky team that had previously fared well against some of the more talented teams in the SEC. Rankings shakeups elsewhere will lead to a slight bump up, but no major moves in the rankings for a Tennessee team that is now 6-2 with a thin margin for error the rest of the way. 15. Cincinnati (21): The Bearcats are tied with BYU in first place of the Big 12 standings with a 5-0 record in league play and now have won seven straight games after beating Baylor 41-20 at home. It's the first seven-game winning streak since the Bearcats made the College Football Playoff in 2021, and now that's the target given the team's role in the Big 12 title race. The remaining schedule is challenging with road trips to Utah and TCU as well as a home date against the aforementioned Cougars, but everything is on the table for Scott Satterfield's team heading into the final third of the season.  \n16. Virginia (16): If voters wanted to knock Virginia a spot or two on their ballots, there is some reason given the last two weeks' performances. The Wahoos were double-digit favorites against both Washington State and North Carolina yet won both games by a combined three points, so it's fair to note that this 7-1 team has not played to expectations since beating Louisville. However, that win against Louisville is a key to any ballot shakeup, so there's not much room to move down.  17. Louisville (19): The Cardinals found a tough test in a letdown spot after beating Miami with Boston College bringing four quarters of fight despite entering the game with a 1-6 record. Louisville thankfully could rise the steady hand of star running back Isaac Brown, who totaled 205 yards rushing in the win. 18. Texas (22): Don't look now, but Texas still has everything ahead of it and can still achieve its preseason goals thanks to a comeback overtime win at Mississippi State. The Longhorns were far from efficient and lost Arch Manning to injury late in the game but found a way to come back from a 17-point fourth quarter deficit to improve to 6-2 overall and 3-1 in SEC play.   \n\n        \n            \n                Texas can celebrate its historic comeback, but consecutive OT wins vs. SEC bottom feeders exposes major flaws\n                \n                    Shehan Jeyarajah                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n19. Oklahoma (13): The Sooners, in theory, should not see a huge drop from losing a team that will be knocking on the door of the top five heading into Week 10. But the competition for ranking spots is much less competitive when you have one loss than when you have two, and now at 6-2 we're projecting Oklahoma to be tied to its loss to Texas and its win against Michigan for placement on most ballots.  20. Missouri (15): There will be a slight drop coming for Missouri as a result of the team's second loss, but there's also a dampened outlook down the road after losing quarterback Beau Pribula to injury. True freshman Sam Zollers stepped up in a tough spot, and now he's tasked with guiding Missouri the rest of the regular season as they cling on to slimming CFP hopes.  21. Michigan (25): With Justice Haynes back in the lineup, Michigan leaned on its ground game to power through a tough start at Michigan State and pull away for a respectable double-digit win against Michigan State.  \n22. Memphis (NR): It's not going to be tough for AP voters to throw Memphis right back on their ballots as the Tigers were at No. 22 just two weeks ago before the upset loss to UAB. Though getting stunned by the Blazers netted zero voting points last week, storming back from a late deficit to take down South Florida will get them back in the 20s on a majority of ballots.  23. Navy (NR): It's time for the last unranked undefeated to break into the top 25. Navy was 30th in voting points last week, and after handling business against FAU is now 7-0 overall and 5-0 in conference play. The remaining schedule includes showdowns against the rest of the contenders in the American, so this should get sorted out on the field but for now voters should not keep the door shut on another strong start from the Midshipmen. 24. Houston (NR): The Cougars had to hold on and nearly let a 24-point lead go on the road at Arizona State, but with some key stops late, Willie Fritz's team was able to improve to 7-1 overall. This team's only loss on the season has been to Texas Tech, so grading this as a top 25 resume in the sport should be a no-brainer. \n25. Utah (NR): Like Memphis, the Utes were a team that were inside the top 25 just last week and only bounced because of a 24-21 loss to BYU. With the Cougars continuing their winning ways and Utah proceeding to blow out Colorado (and doing so with a backup quarterback), it's likely they fall back into favor with the AP voters as one of the top two-loss teams in the country. Projected to drop out: No. 18 South Florida, No. 20 LSU, No. 23 Illinois, No. 24 Arizona State \n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        For a second consecutive fight, Fabio Wardley had to dig deep for a dramatic late stoppage. On Saturday in London's O2 Arena, Wardley forced an 11th-round stoppage of Joseph Parker to win the WBO interim heavyweight championship and plant himself firmly in the mix of contenders for Oleksandr Usyk's undisputed heavyweight championship.Parker, a former WBO heavyweight champion, battled his way back into contention in recent years. As a staple of events held in Saudi Arabia, Parker defeated Deontay Wilder, Zhilei Zhang and Martin Bakole. While biding time as he was passed over for the likes of Daniel Dubois vs. Usyk, Parker was placed into a dangerous fight with Wardley, the hard-hitting English heavyweight.One fight prior to facing Parker, Wardley was pushed to the brink by Justis Huni. Huni had badly outboxed Wardley until Wardley scored a dramatic 10th-round knockout.The script was much the same on Saturday, with Parker largely getting the better of Wardley round after round. Wardley showed a tremendous chin to continue to fight forward and keep himself in the fight.\nWith the kind of power Wardley possesses, it was only a matter of time before he'd turn the tables, and that moment came in Round 11, with a series of heavy shots putting Parker along the ropes. As Wardley fired away, the referee jumped in to halt the action.\nThe stoppage was not without controversy, as many punches in the finishing flurry missed and some felt as though Parker deserved a chance to remain in the fight a bit longer.Regardless, the victory is the biggest of Wardley's career, and at 20-0-1 he is in a position as an interim heavyweight champion for a future title shot.\nFor Parker, attention will certainly be focused on a rematch and an opportunity to put himself right back in the mix.\n            \n    ",

After a deflating end to Tom Aspinall vs. Ciryl Gane at UFC 321, Pereira reminded everyone how he can inject life into the land of giants.Pereira kept a close eye on Saturday's main event, a fight that disappointingly ended in a no contest after Aspinall suffered an eye poke in Round 1. Gane was overdelivering as the underdog before the fight-ending foul occurred. In response to the fight, Pereira offered to \"make the heavyweight division great again.\" Three emojis -- a stone face, a bone and a white house -- accompanied the caption, denoting Pereira's desire to fight Jon Jones at the White House. Pereira has been petitioning to fight Jones at next year's card set to take place at The White House, which President Donald Trump previously announced would take place on June 14, ever since reclaiming the light heavyweight title from Magomed Ankalaev earlier this month. Pereira wants to move up to heavyweight for a potential Jones fight, one he called a \"super fight\" while rejecting the idea of fighting Aspinall.\n\nUFC CEO Dana White is lukewarm on Pereira moving up to heavyweight. He also previously said there was a \"billion to one\" odds he'd book Jones for the White House card. Jones continues campaigning for the fight and accepted Pereira's callout on Saturday.\n\"Alex, I'd be down to bring the highest skill level to the White House,\" Jones wrote on Twitter. \"I appreciate the respect you showed. Let's dance.\"\n            \n    ",

Manning scrambled for a 13-yard gain on the play and was met by a defender when going down. Manning was shown walking off the field with trainers and going into the medical tent. Texas coach Steve Sarkisian had no update on Manning's status after the game.Following Manning's exit, Matthew Caldwell entered the game and threw what proved to be the winning touchdown pass -- a 10-yard strike to Emmett Mosley V. The Texas defense then got the stop it needed on the subsequent possession to get out of Starkville with a 45-38 win. Manning was banged up earlier in the game as well. He walked off the field and into the medical tent following a first-quarter touchdown run but was able to come back in the game on the following drive. The No. 22 Longhorns trailed by as many as 17 points in the fourth quarter, but Manning helped lead his team back. The biggest play of the game came on special teams, however. Texas tied the game at 38 and sent the game to overtime after Ryan Niblett returned a kick 79 yards with 1:47 to play in the fourth. The Longhorns then won it in overtime to 6-2 overall and 3-1 in SEC play. It was Texas' second straight overtime road victory. The Longhorns beat Kentucky 16-13 last week. \nManning was having a career day before exiting the game. The former No. 1 overall recruit in the 2023 recruiting cycle by 247Sports completed 29 of 46 attempts for 346 yards and three touchdowns, and also added a 3-yard rushing touchdown on the ground to open the scoring for the Longhorns.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 Texas Longhorns made history as the first Texas team to earn the AP Poll's preseason No. 1 ranking, but Steve Sarkisian's bunch has not lived up to those expectations. That's led to some frustration in Austin, and on Saturday, hours before Texas was set to go on the road to face Mississippi State, a report emerged that Sarkisian was interested in a move to the NFL and potentially the Tennessee Titans' vacancy. That rumor got quickly shut down by Sarkisian's agent, but it was an indicator that both sides might be looking to the future in Austin. That's a major change from earlier this year when Sarkisian got another pay bump at Texas, making him one of the nation's five highest-paid coaches. After a 5-2 start and some struggles with Mississippi State on the road, it begged the question: what would it cost for either side to get out of their current deal? Steve Sarkisian contract, buyout detailsIncluding his $10.8 million salary this season, Sarkisian's contract pays him $75.8 million through the 2031 season. As part of his new deal, not only did he get a pay bump but his buyout jumped from 70% of what he was owed to 85%, which is a significant and important change. That meant coming into this season his buyout jumped to $64.4 million, and  if they decided to fire him during the year, USA Today cites his buyout for December 1 as being $60.3 million. \nIf Texas were to fire him after this season but before 2026, he would be owed $55.25 million. That is an awful lot of money, but it would not be the most we've seen paid by a team in the state of Texas, as Texas A&M paid Jimbo Fisher $75 million to leave College Station not long ago. As for Sarkisian's reported interest in jumping to the NFL, it's hard to imagine him getting paid in line with his current deal at Texas, either in annual money or contract length. On top of that, his original contract stated that he would owe to Texas $4 million if he left before the end of the 2025 season, with that figure dropping to $3 million to leave before the end of the 2026 season. \nIt seems unlikely an NFL team would jump at paying that much on top of what it would cost to bring Sarkisian from the college ranks to the pros. Texas, meanwhile, would have to be willing to pay one of the biggest buyouts in history to get rid of Sarkisian, but if there is any program in the country that could come up with $55+ million (depending on the timing of firing him), it would be the Longhorns.  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Tom Aspinall vs. Ciryl Gane ended disastrously, but at least the inconclusive ending sets the stage for an immediate rematch. For four-plus minutes, Gane overdelivered against the undisputed champ, but an errant eyepoke brought UFC 321's main event to an unceremonious end.Aspinall vs. Gane ended in a no-contest after Aspinall's vision was compromised on Saturday. The fans fanned out of the arena before the official result, underscoring their disappointment. The ending was certainly deflating, but it rescues matchmakers from booking a title fight that few are interested in seeing. The women's strawweight division also has a new poster child after Mackenzie Dern won the vacant title. With former champion Zhang Weili moving up to challenge Valentina Shevchenko at UFC 322, there's one clear contender for Dern's first title defense.In the aftermath of a turbulent UFC 321, take a look at the best fights to make for Saturday's stars.HeavyweightTom Aspinall vs. Ciryl Gane: Maybe the only silver lining to Saturday's ending is that you have a compelling next fight for both men. Alexander Volkov deserves a title shot, but his tepid win over Jailton Almeida and previous first-round loss to Aspinall didn't inspire confidence. Gane was winning the fight up until he poked Aspinall in the eye. As such, Gane will be a much smaller underdog or possibly a favorite in a rematch. Hopefully, Aspinall's eye heals quickly, and we can run this one back between November and January.\nAlexander Volkov vs. Waldo Cortes Acosta or Ante Delija: Unfortunately, the main event's conclusion casts doubt on Volkov's title aspirations. With only Gane ranked ahead of him, there's no higher-ranked contender for him to fight next. Volkov's best bet, unless he wants to wait it out or fight Gane for an interim title -- if Aspinall needs time to heal -- is to take on the winner of next week's heavyweight clash between Acosta and Delija. The winner of that fight will likely be ranked No. 6 and on a winning streak. It sucks that Volkov will have to prove himself in consecutive (ostensibly) title eliminators, but these things happen in the chaotic fight game.Jailton Almeida vs. Marcin Tybura: It's tough to sell an Almeida fight at this point. He spent 15 minutes spamming a single leg takedown and doing virtually nothing else. He deserved the loss to Volkov on Saturday. Putting a rising contender in with Almeida risks them getting smothered by heavyweight's wet blanket. Tybura is ranked No. 10, coming off a knockout loss with no serious prospects of fighting for a title. It's a fine, low-stakes fight for both men.Women's strawweightMackenzie Dern vs. Tatiana Suarez: Should Zhang Weili return to 115 after fighting Valentina Shevchenko at UFC 322, she should get an immediate title shot. But Zhang is currently a flyweight fighter, so we'll omit her from the conversation. Suarez's stock plummeted in a one-sided loss to Zhang, but there are no compelling contenders in the division. Amanda Lemos, Yan Xiaonan and Jessica Andrade all have wins over Dern but are coming off losses. Suarez is ranked No. 1 in the division and is coming off a bounce-back win. That's enough to earn a title shot with the division's current state.\nVirna Jandiroba vs. Iasmin Lucindo or Gillian Robertson: Lucindo and Robertson meet in a clash of top 10 strawweights in December. Jandiroba would be a suitable test for the winner, and the winner would be a solid bounce-back fight for Jandiroba. Unfortunately, Jandiroba has already fought most of her contemporaries near the top of the division, so she'll have to look further down the card or continue to play gatekeeper.\n            ",

UFC 321 was meant to mend a long period of inactivity for the new undisputed heavyweight champion. Instead, an accidental eye poke brought Saturday's main event with Ciryl Gane to a frustrating end.Aspinall, who graduated to undisputed champion after Jon Jones vacated the title in June, was looking forward to an active title reign after being benched for most of the last two years. On Saturday, things got off to a rough start and only got worse. Challenger Gane overdelivered as an underdog, getting the better of Aspinall in the first round. Aspinall never got the chance to get going after an errant eye poke in the final 30 seconds rendered Aspinall unable to compete, leading to a no contest.Saturday's pay-per-view also crowned a new women's strawweight champion. Mackenzie Dern, empowered by her daughter cagside, cinched her second win over Virna Jandiroba to win the title vacated by Zhang Weili.Plus, Umar Nurmagomedov may not have put together the dominant showing that UFC CEO Dana White wanted, but he did pick up an important win over Mario Bautista. Nurmagomedov had to navigate some troubled waters with Bautista attempting a deep submission early and then leading a big knee late. But the prodigy of cousin Khabib Nurmagomedov did just that in a unanimous decision in which he swept the judges' scorecards. He likely awaits the winner of champion Merab Dvalishvili and Petr Yan after they meet in December.\nCBS Sports was with you throughout fight week with the latest news,  in-depth features, and betting advice to consider.

The sixth-ranked Ducks took a 7-0 lead just before halftime and doubled that advantage in the third quarter before seeing star quarterback Dante Moore leave the game with a bloody nose.Moore got clotheslined on a tackle in the third quarter by a Wisconsin defender, whose arm somehow got between his helmet and facemask and clocked the star quarterback on the bridge of his nose. Moore took his helmet off and had blood pouring from his nose after the hit as trainers came out to attend to him. \nIt was a freak incident, but a painful one for Moore. He left the game with the trainers tending to him and spent 15 minutes in the injury tent, per the Fox broadcast. Moore did return to the sideline with his helmet on, but was not in for the next Oregon offensive drive and remained on the sidelines in a parka in the fourth quarter. \nOregon turned to sophomore quarterback Brock Thomas with Moore out. Thomas came in and led a touchdown drive that was capped off with his first career passing touchdown -- one that went to Gernorris Wilson, a 6-foot-5, 318-pound lineman who was lined up as a tight end on the play. \nWith Wisconsin's offense providing no threat of a comeback, the Ducks appearing to be taking a cautious approach to their star QB's injury and rolling with Thomas, who took advantage of a chance at some extended play. Moore had a quiet game before exiting with the injury, going 9-for-15 for 86 yards through the air and minus-13 yards rushing after taking a few sacks. \nOn the season, Moore has completed 72.3% of his passes for 1,686 yards, 19 touchdowns and four interceptions in his first year as the Ducks' starter. Oregon will have a bye week next week before making a trip to Iowa to face the Hawkeyes in a challenging road test. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Opening night was full of extremes for the Philadelphia 76ers. Joel Embiid was terrible. Not only did he finish the night with four points on nine shots, but he did so against a Celtics team that lost essentially its entire front court to injuries, free agency or trades over the summer. Philadelphia won the game because Tyrese Maxey and VJ Edgecombe went nuclear in a 74-point explosion. It was as if we were watching a franchise change hands in real time, 48 minutes of Wally Pipp getting benched for Lou Gehrig. The 2023 MVP was the past. The 24-year-old All-Star and the No. 3 overall pick were the future.That's still probably true, but Philadelphia fans can breathe easy knowing that Wednesday's Embiid is starting to feel a bit more like the aberration after a far stronger Saturday follow-up. He scored 20 points in 20 minutes, seemingly his current on-court limit right now to preserve his health. Though he's not nearly as bouncy as he was a few years ago, he moved somewhat more comfortably than he did against the Celtics in Saturday's win over the Charlotte Hornets, even notching a couple of steals. Was this the player who won MVP three years ago? No, but it was a reasonably effective player, one who may not have been able to stay out there long enough to swing the game in crunch time, but who could at least do his part earlier on to keep it close enough for his teammates to finish the job. That hasn't always been the case for essentially any of Embiid's career. He's barely played over the last two years. If Philadelphia isn't careful, that will be the case for the rest of his career.In essence, Saturday was our first glimpse at what could be the new normal in Philadelphia, one in which a carefully managed Embiid is preserved enough to have some impact rather than sitting games out entirely. His minutes limit will likely increase over time, but within reason. He's guessed that he'll never play in another back-to-back. Some Embiid is better than none at all.\nThe 76ers were never equipped for a part-time Embiid before. There are still areas in which it will be a struggle -- most notably defense. But the 76ers have never come close to this sort of shot-creation depth, and that at least offers a pathway to building a viable offense without Embiid on the floor.Maxey again led the way with 28 points on Saturday, but Quentin Grimes wasn't far behind with 24. He's become a bit of an afterthought in Philadelphia, even signing a one-year qualifying offer to become an unrestricted free agent next offseason after the 76ers failed to make a competitive offer for his services long-term, but this is someone who averaged almost 27 points per game last March. He was so good that he earned the ultimate individual distinction a bad team can bestow: he was benched in games down the stretch because he helped them win too many games. Grimes is probably a 3-and-D player on a 76ers team with a healthier Embiid gobbling up his standard possession share. On this team? He can get far closer to his post-deadline volume from last season.Jared McCain, who would've run away with Rookie of the Year had he remained healthy last season, hasn't played yet. Neither has Paul George. Remember Paul George? The podcaster who played in nine All-Star Games? Like Embiid, he probably can't approach his peak volume. But with all the shot-creation Philadelphia has accumulated in its backcourt, having him around as an ensemble shooter feels like a luxury.\nThere's probably a ceiling on this sort of team without some significant defensive addition or outrageous growth from the young players, but they're in the Eastern Conference and they're going to be able to score. That's enough to remain reasonably competitive as they attempt to figure out what comes next. As short-term formulas go, you could do a lot worse. As long-term formulas go, well, it's still not clear if The Process has technically ended yet, so let's try to stick to the short term. In that short term, the 76ers are undefeated with a compromised Embiid. If all they'll ever have is this compromised version of him, we're at least starting to see how they can win games around those limitations rather than punting entire seasons away because of them.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        No. 22 Texas battled back from a 17-point deficit and scored 24 points in the fourth quarter to eke out a 45-38 overtime win on the road against Mississippi State. Saturday's result represents the Longhorns' largest comeback win since they erased a 21-point deficit in 2007 against Oklahoma State. This is also just the second time in program history that Texas has won multiple overtime games in a season. The Longhorns survived a similar scare against Kentucky in Week 8. Texas trailed 38-21 with 10 minutes left to play in the fourth quarter after Mississippi State quarterback Blake Shapen connected with running back Davon Booth for a 62-yard touchdown. That's when the Longhorns took over. They answered with a quick nine-play, 75-yard scoring drive capped by a 21-yard scoring connection between quarterback Arch Manning and wide receiver Emmett Mosley V. The defense forced a quick three-and-out and then the offense again moved the ball with some ease, allowing kicker Mason Shipley to hit on a 26-yard field goal that cut Mississippi State's lead to 38-31. \nInstead of taking time off the clock, Mississippi State again went three-and-out. The Bulldogs then made the poor decision to punt the ball to Texas' Ryan Niblett, who made them pay taking the boot 79 yards for the game-tying touchdown with 1:47 left on the clock. Niblett was also Texas' hero against Kentucky, as he returned two punts for a total of 88 yards that allowed the Longhorns to score some key points. He also returned a punt for a touchdown in a win over Oklahoma two weeks earlier.\nMississippi State got painfully close to field goal range at the end of regulation. Shapen fumbled a would-be pass attempt on third-and-6, though, which forced the Bulldogs to punt with less than 10 seconds left in the fourth quarter. \nTexas faced further adversity in overtime when Manning exited the game after his head bounced off of the turf. He was slow to get up and went straight to the medical tent with the help of Texas' team trainers. That just meant it was backup Matthew Caldwell's opportunity to play hero. On his second snap from scrimmage, Caldwell lofted a beautiful pass to Mosley, who made an equally impressive snag to get one foot down in the end zone and hand the Longhorns a touchdown on the first possession of the extra period. From there, Texas' defense locked the game down. Mississippi State was eventually forced into a fourth-and-20 after a pair of procedural penalties and Shapen was sacked for a loss of 32 yards by Ethan Burke to end a desperation conversion attempt. \nThough he got knocked out of the game late, Manning played the best game of his career to preserve Texas' season. He completed 29 passes for a career-high 346 yards and three touchdowns. He also rushed for a touchdown. With the win, Texas advanced to 6-2 on the season with a 3-1 record in SEC play. The Longhorns face another huge test next week as No. 10 Vanderbilt, which beat No. 15 Missouri in Week 9, comes to town. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Dodgers catcher Will Smith is overshadowed, perhaps perpetually so. He's buried beneath much bigger names like Shohei Ohtani, Freddie Freeman and Mookie Betts on the Dodgers. As a great hitting catcher, he's stuck behind Cal Raleigh. He's not even the most famous Will Smith in California.Smith was overshadowed again in Game 2 of the World Series. Smith was integral to the Dodgers' 5-1 victory, which pulled them even, 1-1, in the best-of-seven Fall Classic. His battery-mate, pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto, just happened to be even more integral.Yamamoto deserves all the praise he's going to get. He's now gone back-to-back complete games in the playoffs, a feat unheard of for decades (it hadn't happened since 2001). He was masterful. We can't ignore Smith, though. He came through with a two-out, RBI single to get the scoring started in the first inning. He broke a tie with a solo home run in the top of the seventh. He put the ball in play with the bases loaded in the eighth and ended up with an RBI fielder's choice. That's a 2 for 4 game with three RBI. Not too shabby. \nBear in mind Smith, as a catcher, is also involved in game-planning with the pitcher and working with him all night. Yamamoto gets the lion's share of the praise for his outing, but Smith was helpful behind the plate, too, calling pitchers and working with his pitcher. \"I think the game calling, the relationship with the pitchers has continued to get better,\" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said after the game. \"He's always had the bat to ball, the ability to hit to all fields, the ability to hit verse left, verse right. He understands when to pick his spots. He does his homework. I think at the end of the day, he's a guy that just doesn't panic. He's really got a flat-line heartbeat, and in the postseason, that's what you need.\"Smith entered the postseason with a hand injury, to the point that it looked like he might not be able to play defense and would just be a pinch hitter. He's back to being the full-time catcher, though, and he's hit .314 with six RBI in 40 plate appearances.\nIn the regular season, Smith had his best year. He was limited to 110 games, but slashed .296/.404/.497, good for a 152 OPS+. The league only hit .245 with a .315 OBP this year and catchers were held to a .238/.306/.394 line, so Smith exceeded his fellow backstops by nearly 60 points of average and roughly 200 points of OPS. How many people really noticed what an offensive force he was this season? Dodgers fans. Fantasy baseball players. That might be about it. Why? Because Smith was overshadowed. Raleigh hit 60 home runs and might win the American League MVP. He set a new record for catcher home runs. Smith had a much higher average and OBP. Speaking of MVPs, Ohtani is likely to win the honor in the National League. It'll be his second straight with the Dodgers in his first two seasons in Los Angeles. Freeman and Betts have also won MVPs and all three hit in front of Smith in the lineup, once again, you guessed it, overshadowing him.\nSmith would be one of the biggest stars on a good number of MLB teams. On this Dodgers team, though, he's easy to miss. Not that it seems to bother Smith. He signed a 10-year, $140 million extension that started before the 2024 season. Did you even remember that? Maybe. But maybe not. Why? You know the answer. The Dodgers have a boatload of much more eye-popping contracts. Once again, he's overshadowed. Game 2 of the 2025 World Series made perfect sense. Smith was central to the Dodgers win and relegated to a mere footnote. He deserves more credit than that, however, as he's one of the best catchers in baseball and just had an amazing performance to help his team win a World Series game.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        No. 15 Missouri lost starting quarterback Beau Pribula to a left ankle injury early in the third quarter of its 17-10 loss to No. 10 Vanderbilt on Saturday. Sources told CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz the injury will cost Pribula at least the rest of the regular season, with further testing to come on Sunday. Following the game, Missouri coach Eli Drinkwitz told reporters that Pribula's ankle \"had to be popped back in.\"\"Beau has no broken bones but he did have an ankle injury that had to be popped back in,\" Drinkwitz said. \"Don't have a timetable for his return but it could be a while.\"With the game tied 3-3, Pribula got bent up on a fourth-down rushing attempt near the goal line when the pile of bodies pushed back on top of him as the Vanderbilt defense stacked him up. Pribula stayed down on the field in pain as the rest of the two teams left the field. He was tended to by medical staff and quickly put into an air cast before being carted to the tunnel where the broadcast showed him being transferred to a wheelchair to be taken to the back. \nPribula's injury forced the Tigers to turn to true freshman Matt Zollers, who began the season as the third-string quarterback. After losing Sam Horn for the season to an injury in the opener, Zollers became the backup and had to take over for the Tigers in a hostile road environment in a game with College Football Playoff implications. Both the Tigers and Commodores entered Saturday at 6-1 overall with 2-1 marks in SEC play.  Pribula, a Penn State transfer, was 9-of-14 for 68 yards passing and added 10 yards on four carries rushing prior to the injury in a defensive battle in Nashville. For the season, Pribula entered Saturday having completed 70% of his passes for 1,617 yards, 11 touchdowns and seven interceptions, adding 210 yards and five touchdowns on the ground for the Tigers. Zollers, a four-star, top 100 recruit in the class of 2025, received only a few snaps this season prior to Saturday, completing all six of his attempts for 75 yards and a touchdown. In his first series, Zollers looked solid, completing 4-of-6 passes for 27 yards including a key completion on fourth and 4, but the drive stalled in the red zone and Missouri hit the upright on a short field goal to keep the game tied. \nWhile Missouri eventually lost 17-10, Zollers finished the game with completions on 14 of his 23 passing attempts for 138 yards and one touchdown. \"I was really proud of him. I thought he did an excellent job,\" Drinkwitz said of Zollers. \"Obviously, the one turnover on a mesh read, but other than that, I though he played really big. Fourth-down conversions to give us a chance and then when they took the lead, to drive the ball down and score was really impressive. Moment wasn't too big for him.\"That performance from Zollers might raise the spirits some of the Missouri faithful, but seeing Pribula go down with an injury that will cost him the remainder of the Tigers' regular season puts a significant damper on the excitement of what has been a fantastic first half of the 2025 season. The Tigers, now 6-2 overall and 2-2 in SEC play, enter an off week before hosting No. 3 Texas A&M on Nov. 8.\n            ",

Brown as the NFL's Nov. 4 trade deadline approaches, according to ESPN. Teams around the league are \"eyeing Brown,\" but it would take a \"blockbuster offer\" for the Eagles to trade Brown, per ESPN.There was some buzz earlier this month that Philadelphia could be open to a move after Brown released a few cryptic social media posts that seemed to point at his discontent with the franchise. Brown later cleared the air while admitting that he was frustrated with the state of Philadelphia's offense to start the season. \"This is home. This is my home,\" Brown said Oct 1. \"Unfortunately, I did it to myself. I won't say 'unfortunately.' I did it to myself. This is my home. I love it here.\"\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 8 odds, predictions, expert picks: Will Aaron Rodgers topple Packers?

He made the earlier social media posts after a two-catch, seven-yard performance in the Eagles' Week 4 win against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Though Brown is averaging a career-low 56.4 yards per game, Philadelphia has made an effort to get Brown more involved in the offense in the weeks since. His performance against the Vikings was his best of the season. Brown has been ruled out for Sunday's game vs. the New York Giants because of a hamstring injury, but he's not expected to be sidelined for long. \nBrown has eclipsed 1,000 yards receiving in each of his three seasons with Philadelphia after the Eagles acquired him in a trade with the Tennessee Titans during the 2022 NFL Draft. \n            \n    ",

Bet it at bet365 here:Raptors (+105) to defeat the Magic\nThe Raptors had their four-game winning streak snapped in a 119-92 loss to the Knicks on Wednesday, but the Knicks are one of the favorites to win the Eastern Conference and are tied for the second-best record in the conference, so that's certainly not a bad loss. The game before, the Raptors defeated the Thunder, 103-101, on the road, proving they have the talent to knock off any team in the league. A recent win in Oklahoma City means a trip to Orlando shouldn't intimidate the Raptors, who are 29-20 this season. The Magic (24-22) are coming off a 133-124 win over the Heat on Wednesday, but they lost four straight before that contest. The Raptors have won four straight games against Orlando, including a 107-106 win in December. The model projects Toronto win in 64% of simulations, showcasing strong value at plus-money odds. Back the Raptors at bet365 here:Michigan State (+2.5) vs. Michigan (-110)\"Both of these teams enter their first of two regular season rivalry showdowns coming off sweaty mid-week wins, with Michigan snatching victory from Nebraska and Sparty having to roar back from a potential upset spot against Rutgers,\" SportsLine expert Chip Patterson said. \"But while Michigan State might have been caught in a lookahead spot, I think Michigan's close win is more in line with its recent form. The Wolverines have failed to cover in each of their last seven games, and there are some matchup points that will allow Michigan State to negate some of what has made Michigan so excellent this season. Plus, Tom Izzo at home as an underdog in a rivalry game? I'll take those points all day.\" Back Michigan State at bet365 here:Nuggets (+2.5) vs. Clippers (-115)The Nuggets play the second half of a back-to-back following a 107-103 victory over the Nets, which could signal multiple players sitting out Friday given the amount of injuries currently facing Denver. However, the Nuggets retain homecourt advantage for Friday, and they are 13-9 in Denver this season. The Clippers aren't at full health either, including Kawhi Leonard (knee) as questionable. The Clippers are on a roll, winning nine of their last 10 games, but six of those wins came against losing teams. Even with Denver's injury situation, which has featured Nikola Jokic (knee) out for weeks, only the Thunder and Pistons have more wins than the Nuggets this season. Denver enters at 32-16 and the Clippers are 22-24. The model projects the Nuggets to cover in 59% of simulations. Back the Nuggets at bet365 here:\nLooking for NBA and college basketball picks?You've seen the model's best bets for Friday.

    "body": "\n        The College Sports Commission is currently investigating LSU for potential unreported NIL deals in violation of rules governing player compensation, per an email obtained by The Athletic. In that email sent on Jan. 15 to LSU athletic director Verge Ausberry, the CSC's head of investigations, Katie B. Medearis, informed the school that they were investigating whether they \"failed to report one or more third-party Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals,\" and requested a phone call with Ausberry or the LSU compliance staff. While the timing suggested it could be related to LSU's active transfer portal activity in football, where Lane Kiffin and the Tigers put together the No. 1 class in the country, NOLA.com reports the investigation is not related to the football program. This is the first known investigation by the CSC, which was formulated by the power conferences last year to govern revenue sharing and verify NIL deals under the new rules set by the House settlement in 2024. \nThe CSC issued a brief statement to The Athletic, confirming they have reached out to multiple schools regarding investigations.\"As previously indicated, the CSC has reached out to several schools to inform them of investigations into unreported NIL deals,\" a CSC spokesperson said. \"We will not comment further at this time.\"The specifics of the CSC's investigation into LSU are unknown, as nothing in their email to LSU detailed what players, sports or deals may be under scrutiny. \nThere remains a question of how much teams will cooperate with CSC investigations, and LSU figures to be the first -- and biggest -- test case for the commission. Their first task will be finding firm evidence to confirm any unreported NIL deals, but what the college sports world will really be looking at is what punishment they're able to levy if they do. LSU released a statement to NOLA.com stating they expected the investigation to be resolved quickly. \"We have been in regular communication with the CSC since the organization's formation and appreciate their ongoing collaboration and guidance,\" LSU spokesperson Zach Greenwell said in a statement. \"We anticipate this specific inquiry will be resolved shortly. We will not comment further on regulatory matters.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\nWe're six matches into the Liam Rosenier era at Chelsea, and so far, so good. He has won five of those matches, with the only loss coming against current league leaders Arsenal when the Blues still gave a good account of themselves, and they've done this without Cole Palmer for the most part. The English midfielder has been limited to only 14 appearances in all competitions this season while dealing with various injuries. How to watch Chelsea vs. West Ham United, oddsDate: Saturday, Jan. 31 | Time: 12:30 p.m. Location: Stamford Bridge -- LondonTV: USAOdds: Chelsea -200; Draw +350; West Ham United +500As the Blues learned during the Club World Cup, they will go as far as Palmer can take them, but under Rosenior, that could be changing. Enzo Fernandez has gotten more of a run as an attacking midfielder, while Moises Caicedo has also found his own shooting boots. Questions still remain about who the best striker is for the Blues at this stage of the season, but in Palmer's absence, others have been able to find their attacking form, which is only a good thing.Palmer did return as Chelsea clinched a top eight spot in the Champions League league phase, and it was a big one. He netted two assists, both to Joao Pedro, which is something else that should be reminiscent of Chelsea's trophy-winning summer. The Premier League title may be out of reach, but the Blues are contenders for the UCL crown and can climb above Manchester United into the top four of the table.In their six matches under Rosenior, Chelsea have scored 16 goals while conceding six goals. That alone will get the job done, as while Rosenior is known as a more defensive manager, the attack isn't suffering under his leadership. Next up, the Blues will host a London derby where they face a resurgent West Ham United. The Hammers may still be in the relegation zone, five points off of safety but they've managed to win their last two games as Nuno Espirito Santo is pulling the side out of their slump. With Chelsea coming off a win away from home, facing Napoli, this is a perfect let down spot for them, and these are the kind of matches where their mentality under Rosenior will be tested. A loss to West Ham won't hurt the season in any way, but it's the kind of result that would bring in questions of whether we're just seeing a new manager bounce or true changes at Chelsea.All signs are pointing to the latter right now, and with the second legs of the EFL Cup semifinal coming around the corner on Tuesday (Catch the action on Paramount+), they'll want to keep the good form going into their rematch away from Arsenal. Due to that match coming in short succession, this isn't a time where it makes sense to start Palmer when he can shake off more rust but as the stakes get higher in the season, Chelsea will need him firing on all cylinders. \n            ",

Here's how to watch:Will Conte's side react? Napoli's Antonio Conte have to react after a disappointing week that led to the 3-0 defeat away against Juventus and then the 3-2 loss to Chelsea on Wednesday that led to the elimination from the Champions League tournament. Napoli are facing a difficult moment especially due to injuries, but also need to stop the slide before it goes any further as Inter are now nine points ahead and the Azzurri have dropped to being tied on points with Roma in third place of the Serie A standings. How to watch Napoli vs. Fiorentina, oddsDate: Saturday, Jan. 18 | Time: 12 p.m. ETLocation: Stadio Diego Armando Maradona -- Naples Live stream: Paramount+Odds: Napoli -132; Draw +244; Fiorentina +395How to watch Serie A Matchday 23All times U.S./Eastern. Friday, Jan. 30Lazio 3, Genoa 2Saturday, Jan. 31Pisa vs. Sassuolo, 9 a.m. (Paramount+)Napoli vs. Fiorentina, 12 p.m. (Paramount+)Cagliari vs. Hellas Verona, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)Sunday, Feb. 1Torino vs. Lecce, 6:30 a.m. (Paramount+)Como vs. Atalanta, 9 a.m. (Paramount+)Cremonese vs. Inter, 12 p.m. (Paramount+)Parma vs. Juventus, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)Monday, Feb. 2Udinese vs. AS Roma, 12:30 p.m. (Paramount+)\nTuesday, Feb. 3Bologna vs. AC Milan, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Minnesota Vikings fired general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah on Friday, just eight months after signing him to a multi-year contract extension.\"Following our annual end-of-season organizational meetings over the last several weeks and after careful consideration, we have decided it is in the best interest of the team to move forward with new leadership of our football operations,\" co-owners Mark and Zygi Wilf said in a statement. \"These decisions are never easy. We are grateful for Kwesi's contributions and commitment to the organization over the past four years and wish him and his family the best in the future.\"Executive Vice President of Football Operations Rob Brzezinski will oversee the Vikings' front-office operations through the 2026 NFL Draft, after which the team will begin its search for a new general manager.\"Rob brings tremendous credibility and experience, understands our roster and has the ability to build consensus and rely on the expertise of our personnel and coaches,\" the Wilfs said. \"Building a team that can contend for championships drives us every day, and we look forward to bringing our fans the success they so deserve.\"\nThe move came as a shock around the NFL, as the Vikings signed Adofo-Mensah to an extension in May after Minnesota's 14-3 campaign in 2024. The Vikings took a step back in 2025, going 9-8 and missing the playoffs after opting not to re-sign Sam Darnold. Minnesota instead chose to move forward with 2024 first-round quarterback J.J. McCarthy, who had injury problems and struggled, as many young quarterbacks do, when he was healthy. Darnold, meanwhile, has led the Seattle Seahawks to Super Bowl LX, where they are the favorites to hoist the Lombardi Trophy against the New England Patriots. Why the Vikings fired Adofo-MensahIn the four years with Adofo-Mensah as general manager, the Vikings went 43-25 with a pair of playoff appearances. His work in building the 2024 team was widely praised, but his draft record and the Vikings' cap sheet spelled trouble going into 2026. \nIn four drafts with Adofo-Mensah at the helm, the Vikings struggled to acquire the impact players they hoped for. His five first-round picks in that span -- Lewis Cine, Jordan Addison, McCarthy, Dallas Turner and Donovan Jackson -- have produced mixed results. Cine was cut after two seasons, Jackson anchored an underwhelming offensive line this year, and Addison has struggled to stay on the field because of injuries and off-field issues. Turner emerged as a bright spot with eight sacks, but the biggest issue for Adofo-Mensah was going all-in on McCarthy.The Vikings traded up to take McCarthy in the 2024 draft, giving up a pair of mid-round picks to jump from No. 11 to No. 10 overall. The plan was always for Darnold to serve as a bridge to McCarthy -- who missed his rookie season with a knee injury -- but when he led Minnesota to a 14-3 record, the Vikings had to give the decision serious thought.\nThey ultimately stuck with the plan and turned things over to McCarthy, who struggled in 10 games this season. He completed 57.6% of his passes for 1,632 yards, 11 touchdowns and 12 interceptions in his first year as a starter. While the Vikings went 6-4 with McCarthy under center, much of their success hinged on an elite (and expensive) defense.That's what made choosing McCarthy over Darnold so controversial. The Vikings had a defense ready to contend now, but even the most optimistic view of McCarthy involved a young quarterback with considerable talent who would need time to reach his potential. That put the offense and defense on different timelines, and the result was a 9-8 season.Now Minnesota enters 2026 with a cluttered cap sheet, nearly $49 million over the limit, per Over the Cap. Only the Kansas City Chiefs face a more dire cap situation, and the next Vikings GM will have a tall order in figuring out how best to proceed. Whoever takes over will be tasked with getting Minnesota back into the hunt in the highly competitive NFC North, where the Chicago Bears, Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers all have playoff aspirations for 2026. And they'll have to do it without many clear avenues to upgrade the roster and likely needing to shed money.\nThe McCarthy decision now facing Minnesota's next GM\nA new regime in Minnesota could mean changes at quarterback sooner rather than later. We'll find out exactly how much belief coach Kevin O'Connell has in McCarthy, as Adofo-Mensah was clearly a strong believer in the young quarterback. A new GM, however, won't have the same ties to him.As such, one of the first major evaluations for whoever steps into the general manager role will be whether they view McCarthy as the franchise quarterback of the future.Given the Vikings' cap situation, it wouldn't be surprising if McCarthy gets another year to show what he can do. Minnesota likely won't be in the market for a high-priced free agent, and this year's draft class isn't highly regarded beyond Fernando Mendoza, who is the favorite to go No. 1 to the Raiders. Without a clear path to a replacement, a new Vikings GM may opt for an evaluation year with McCarthy.\nThe 2026 season was always going to be important for McCarthy's development, but with a new general manager in place who didn't draft him, it will be even more critical. He won't just need to show growth -- he'll need to take a major leap into becoming a quality starter if he wants to keep the job long-term.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        No. 3 Michigan made a statement on Friday with an 83-71 win over No. 7 Michigan State to move into sole possession of first place in the Big Ten standings. The Wolverines were coming off a win over Nebraska -- one of three unbeaten teams in Division I basketball -- before moving to 5-0 against AP Top 25 opponents with a victory over their in-state rival.The Wolverines (20-1, 10-1 Big Ten) have now won six consecutive games since dropping their only game of the season against Wisconsin earlier this month. Michigan is now 7-0 against Quad 1 opponents, and 17 of its 21 wins have been by at least 10 points. \nMichigan State (19-3, 9-2) entered the week 12-6 overall against Michigan when both programs were ranked and had won seven of the last nine matchups against its in-state rival. The Wolverines had only three wins in their last 25 meetings when playing at the Breslin Center. Friday marked Michigan's first win over MSU on the road since 2018 in one of the most anticipated matchups in the No. 197 meeting between the programs.\nMichigan star forward Yaxel Lendeborg led the charge by finishing with 26 points and 12 rebounds. The former UAB star recorded his fourth double-double of the season in the victory, while fellow transfer guard Elliot Cadeau scored nine of his 17 points in the second half.Mara continues to be one of the best transfer portal additionsPart of what made Michigan such a difficult matchup last season was the two-big lineup that May deployed with Wolf and Goldin both starting in the frontcourt. May kept a similar style this season, with a frontline of Lendeborg, Morez Johnson Jr. and Aday Mara that gives opposing teams headaches.Mara, a former blue-chip recruit in the 2023 recruiting cycle by 247Sports, is averaging 2.6 blocks per game despite logging just 22.9 minutes per game. The former UCLA big man was underused during his time with the Bruins. Case and point? Mara logged at least 20 minutes in just 11 games combined during his two seasons with the program.\nUnder May at Michigan, Mara has become one of -- if not the best defenders in college basketball. He's shooting 68.9% from the field and is also one of the best outlet passers in the sport. Mara is one of the best transfer portal additions in the sport.Mara finished with eight points, five rebounds and three blocks in 21 minutes.A tale of two halvesMichigan State was a completely different team in the second half. The Spartans shot 7 of 26 (2 of 12 from the 3-point line) in the first half, but the final 20 minutes were a different story. Michigan State knocked down 15 of 34 shots (44.1%) in the second half and was able to chip away at the deficit.It all started when MSU opened the second half on a 15-4 run. However, what hurt MSU was the 3-point shooting. As a team, Michigan State was just 4 of 23 from downtown. Michigan State took its first lead of the game with 7:27 remaining, but Michigan proceeded to knock down six of its next seven shots to regain the lead for good.\nMichigan State, per KenPom.com, allows the lowest offensive rebounding percentage (21.4) in the sport. The Spartans had only allowed double-digit offensive rebounds once (against Arkansas) entering the night. Michigan secured 11 offensive rebounds, and six of them came from Lendeborg.When Michigan defeated Texas A&M in the second round of the NCAA Tournament last spring, the Wolverines were able to advance by beating the Aggies at their own game: on the offensive glass. Tonight was more of the same. Michigan created second-chance opportunities in the first half. The Wolverines outscored the Spartans 14-6 in second-chance points.Michigan's path to the Big Ten regular-season titleIn CBS Sports' latest Bracketology projections, Michigan remained a No. 1 seed alongside Duke, Arizona and Nebraska. With the NCAA Tournament less than two months away, the Wolverines still have time to add to their resume to potentially secure the No. 1 overall seed in the Big Dance.\nAfter picking up a win over Michigan State, the path to a Big Ten regular-season title is also clearer. Notable games in conference play the rest of the season include a matchup on the road against Purdue, home games against UCLA and Michigan State and another road game against No. 9 Illinois. Another game on the schedule (that obviously isn't part of conference play) is a matchup against Duke on Feb. 21. That game could have major stakes as a resume builder for both teams.\n        \n            \n                Bracketology Snapshot: Key games worth monitoring this weekend\n                \n                    Isaac Trotter                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMichigan's last regular-season Big Ten title came in 2021. The Wolverines have captured the Big Ten regular season title three times since the turn of the century. Michigan won the Big Ten tournament title and reached the Sweet 16 last season during Dusty May's first season at the helm. It was one of the best year-to-year turnarounds in college basketball history.This version of Michigan might be just as good as last year. That's saying a lot after May rebuilt a majority of this roster via the transfer portal and high school recruiting. Michigan is a legit national title threat. The Wolverines have everything it takes to be the final team standing in Indianapolis in April. This game was a prime example of why.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Former UCLA star Amari Bailey, who appeared in 10 NBA games with the Charlotte Hornets, has hired a lawyer to petition the NCAA with the hopes of returning to college basketball on one more season of eligibility, according to ESPN. The 21-year-old Bailey spent one season with the Bruins before declaring for the 2023 NBA Draft. \"Right now I'd be a senior in college,\" Bailey told ESPN. \"I'm not trying to be 27 years old playing college athletics. No shade to the guys that do; that's their journey. But I went to go play professionally and learned a lot, went through a lot. So like, why not me?\"  Bailey was selected by the Hornets in the second round of the draft and logged 10 games as a rookie on a two-way contract. In that span, he averaged 2.3 points on 33.3% shooting from the field. He signed with the Brooklyn Nets in September 2024 and eventually joined the Long Island Nets of the NBA's G League. Bailey most recently spent time with the Iowa Wolves, the G League affiliate of the Minnesota Timberwolves. \nNo basketball player has ever returned to college after playing in an NBA game. \"The NCAA has not and will not grant eligibility to any players who have signed an NBA contract,\" NCAA senior vice president of external affairs Tim Buckley told ESPN. \"Congress can strengthen NCAA rules so professional athletes cannot sue their way back to competing against college students.\"  Bailey's case will be the latest test of NCAA eligibility as several former players seek a return to the collegiate level. Alabama's Charles Bediako was recently allowed to return to the Crimson Tide after spending three years with various G League teams. \nBediako initially played at Alabama from 2021-23 before declaring for the 2023 NBA Draft, where he went undrafted. He has since appeared in games with the Austin Spurs, Grand Rapids Gold and Motor City Cruise. A key point in Bediako's argument for eligibility is that he is within the NCAA's five-year window for eligibility. The clock started when he enrolled at Alabama as a freshman in the 2021-22 season, and the 2025-26 season marks Year 5 on his clock. Bediako's representation argues that, since Bediako never appeared in an actual NBA game, he should be allowed to return for a fifth year of eligibility. Bediako has already appeared in two games for Alabama this season. He played 25 minutes and scored 13 points in a loss to Tennessee and appeared for 18 minutes with 14 points in a win against Missouri.   \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The latest release of emails from the \"Epstein Files\" shows that convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein connected New York Giants co-owner and chairman Steve Tisch with multiple women while exchanging messages that included personal assessments of those women, according to documents made public by the U.S. Department of Justice.The 2013 communications were included in a release of more than three million Epstein-related records disclosed Friday. Epstein, who died by suicide in a federal jail cell while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges in August 2019, directly communicated with Tisch in the correspondence. Epstein appeared to be not only scouting women for Tisch but also facilitating introductions between women and Tisch. The two also exchanged follow-up commentary after meetings.In several email exchanges, Epstein and Tisch discussed whether women were \"pro or civilian\" or a \"working girl.\" Epstein sent descriptions of women's backgrounds, appearances and personalities, and in some cases, followed up with reports on such meetings. Tisch responded to a number of those messages.Tisch released a statement to Ralph Vacchiano of Fox Sports on his appearance in the Epstein files.\"We had a brief association where we exchanged emails about adult women, and in addition, we discussed movies, philanthropy, and investments,\" Tisch said. \"I did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island. As we all know now, he was a terrible person and someone I deeply regret associating with.\"Fisch, a film producer responsible for the likes of \"Forrest Gump\" and \"American History X,\" took his role with the Giants in 2005. Epstein, a former banker, has faced charges of human trafficking, child sex offenses and serial rape.\nThere are three primary periods of communication between Fisch and Epstein uncovered in the DOJ release.May 2013Emails show Epstein communicating with Tisch, who was attending NFL meetings. After Tisch replied that he was, \"Still in NFL meeting,\" Epstein suggested arranging a meeting with a woman he identified as Russian. Tisch responded minutes later by asking, \"Is she fun?\" The exchange continued that afternoon.June 2013Emails show Tisch asking Epstein directly about specific women. In one exchange, Epstein described a woman as \"exotic,\" noting she spoke mostly French. Tisch replied by asking, \"Working girl?\" Epstein responded, \"Never.\"In a separate exchange, Tisch asked, \"Is my present in NYC?\" Epstein replied, \"Yes.\" Tisch followed up the next morning, asking, \"Can I get my surprise to take me to lunch tomorrow?\"In another exchange, Epstein described a woman in explicit terms, noting she had a \"10 ass,\" and encouraged Tisch to contact her. Tisch replied, \"Thanks Jeffrey,\" and asked about another woman, inquiring as to whether she was \"pro or civilian?\" Epstein responded that she was a \"civilian,\" adding further personal commentary.Epstein sent messages offering detailed commentary after meetings had taken place. In one follow-up, Epstein wrote that Tisch \"did very well,\" adding that the woman was \"a little freaked by the age difference\" and advising him to \"go slow.\" Epstein also referenced attempting to influence her not to return to Ukraine, writing that \"having her crying worked.\" Tisch replied, \"Nice report … Funny comment on crying!!!\"September 2013Emails show social exchanges between Epstein and Tisch tied to the Giants. Tisch offered Epstein two tickets to his suite for a game and invited him to attend other games during the season. Epstein, in turn, invited Tisch to visit him on his private island in the Caribbean, though the emails do not indicate whether Tisch accepted.In another exchange, Epstein wrote to Tisch that he was \"happy to have you as a new but … shared interest friend.\"In 1991, Tisch's family purchased a 50% stake in the Giants franchise. He has accepted the Vince Lombardi Trophy on behalf of the organization following Super Bowl victories after the 2007 and 2011 seasons. His brother, Jonathan Tisch, serves as the team's treasurer.\nThe DOJ has said the release of communications involving Epstein is part of an effort to make previously undisclosed materials public, noting that a person's inclusion in the documents does not, by itself, indicate criminal conduct. The department has come under fire for the delayed release of these files as it missed a Dec. 19, 2025, deadline established by the Epstein Files Transparency Act, as passed by the U.S. House of Representatives.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        It is planned that the Seattle Seahawks will go up for sale after competing in Super LX against the New England Patriots, according to ESPN; however, a spokesman representing the ownership of the franchise refuted those claims on Friday.\"We don't comment on rumors or speculation, and the team is not for sale,\" the spokesman said. \"We've already said that will change at some point per Paul's wishes, but I have no news to share. Our focus right now is winning the Super Bowl and completing the sale of the Portland Trail Blazers in the coming months.\"The Seahawks and Portland Trail Blazers have been owned by the estate of Paul G. Allen since the former owner of both franchises died of cancer in 2018. His sister, Jody, has controlled the teams in the years since his death.The Trail Blazers are in the midst of being sold as Allen's sister, in August 2025, reached an agreement to sell the team to Carolina Hurricanes owner Tom Dundon from Allen's estate. Closing date and sale terms were not disclosed at the time, though ESPN reported that the Blazers were worth an estimated $4 billion.\nIf the Seahawks are indeed put for sale after the NFL's championship game, it would mark the first time in the Super Bowl era that the entirety of a team that played in the title game would be up for sale shortly after its conclusion.A sale could reach between $7 billion and $8 billion, per ESPN, which received that estimate from an executive with another franchise. That would set a new NFL record. The Washington Commanders currently hold the mark after going for over $6 billion to the Josh Harris-led group in 2023.Some of the largest team sales in North American sports have come during the 2020s. Harris and company broke the record that was set in 2022 when the Walton-Penner group purchased the Denver Broncos for $4.65 billion.

    "body": "\n        The Baltimore Ravens are expected to hire Chicago Bears offensive coordinator Declan Doyle for the same role on new coach Jesse Minter's inaugural staff, sources tell CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones. Doyle, who mentored Bears quarterback Caleb Williams to a career year on Ben Johnson's staff in Chicago in 2025, now gets to work with another top NFL signal caller in Lamar Jackson. Doyle, just 29, is expected to handle primary play-calling duties on Minter's staff. The 2025 season was Doyle's first as an offensive coordinator, as he joined Bears coach Johnson's first staff in Chicago. Johnson, who spent three seasons as the offensive coordinator of the Detroit Lions, was the primary playcaller for the Bears. Doyle helped develop the game plan and studied film with Johnson as the Bears climbed out of the NFC North cellar and into the postseason for the first time since 2020. Now he will become the youngest offensive playcaller in the NFL.Under Johnson and Doyle's guidance, the Bears finished sixth in the NFL in total offense (369.2 yards per game) and ninth in scoring offense (25.9 points per game). Chicago's 144.5 yards rushing per game also ranked third in the league, behind only the Buffalo Bills and Baltimore. Williams, a former first overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, threw for a career-high 3,942 yards and 27 touchdowns on 6.9 yards per attempt. Chicago's offensive line also took a big step forward, as it went from allowing a league-worst 68 sacks in 2024 to just 24 in 2025. \n\n        \n            \n                Ravens introduce Jesse Minter: What we learned about new Baltimore coach's plans for Lamar Jackson, more\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMinter is taking over in Baltimore for John Harbaugh, who was fired after 18 seasons. Minter was a former assistant on Harbaugh's Ravens staff and is coming off a two-year stint as the defensive coordinator for the Los Angeles Chargers under Jim Harbaugh, John's brother. With Minter a defensive coach, Doyle will take on a significant role in the direction of the Ravens' offense on the heels of an injury-plagued season for Jackson, a two-time MVP. The Ravens went 8-9 and missed the playoffs for the first time since 2021, taking a big step back on offense in the process. Due in large part to Jackson's injuries, the Ravens finished 27th in the league with just 175.6 yards passing per game. Baltimore missed out on the NFL playoffs for the first time since 2021. \nDoyle, a former student assistant at Iowa, broke into the NFL in 2019 as an offensive assistant with the New Orleans Saints. He reunited with Sean Payton in 2023 as the tight ends coach of the Denver Broncos, a role he served in for two seasons before he was hired by Chicago. \n            ",

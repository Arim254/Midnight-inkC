Thus, it leans on the passing game, and it is facing a defense which does not travel. Five of the six highest point totals that Jacksonville State has allowed have come away from its home stadium. SportsLine's model is projecting 53 combined points as the Over hits in well over 50% of simulations.The model also says one side of the spread hits more than 60% of the time. You can see the model's pick at SportsLine.  So who wins Troy vs. Jacksonville State, and which side of the spread hits more than 60% of the time? Visit SportsLine now to see which side of the Jacksonville State vs. Troy spread to jump on, all from the advanced model that's up on its top-ranked money-line and total picks, and find out.\n            ",

The Volunteers have lost three straight contests, but none of those came at home in either road or neutral site losses to Kansas, Syracuse and No. 14 Illinois. Before that streak, though, Tennessee knocked off No. 3 Houston, 76-73, in Las Vegas. The Vols are 5-0 at home this season as they return to Knoxville to take on Louisville, which lost its only road game this season. Tennessee has won two straight against the Cardinals, including a 77-55 final in Louisville last year, as the model projects the Vols to win and cover in 64% of simulations. Back Tennessee at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Knicks (-2.5) vs. Spurs (-110)The Knicks have made it known that winning the NBA Cup means something to them. Despite winning at least 50 games in back-to-back seasons, the Knicks aren't oftten discussed among the elite NBA teams, and that opinion may change with an in-season tournament title. Jalen Brunson has scored at least 30 points in four straight games, including 40 points against the Magic in the semifinals, and Karl-Anthony Towns added 29 points and eight rebounds against Orlando. Victor Wembanyama returned as the Spurs upset the Thunder in the semifinals on Saturday, but he only played 21 minutes after missing a month with a calf injury, so his minutes will likely be limited again. The Knicks have won five straight and are 9-1 over their last 10 games, and the model projects the Knicks to win and cover in 57% of simulations. Back the Knicks at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Queens (NC) vs. Arkansas: Over 173.5 total points (-105)\"As Queens plays at only one speed, fast, the Royals might as well have Lando Norris as coach,\" legendary SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall said. \"The Formula 1 style preferred by Grant Leonard puts up lots of points (85 ppg) but gives them up just as fast (86 ppg), and Queens is even less inclined to touch the handbrake against power conference opposition, most recently throwing caution to the wind on Sunday at Wake Forest. The result was a 111-73 loss, the fourth time in six games that someone in a Queens game hit the century mark. We suppose many Razorbacks have eyes as big as saucers at this chance to score points, which John Calipari won't discourage, as the Porkers score even more rapidly (88.1 ppg) than the Royals.\" Back the Over at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:\nWant more basketball picks?You've seen some of the model's Tuesday best bets.

The two-time All-Star is coming off a season-high of 40 points in New York's NBA Cup semifinals win over Orlando. Brunson added 8 assists and 4 rebounds for a full stat line, and he's having the best season of his eight-year career. He's averaging a career-high of 28.8 points and has an ideal matchup versus San Antonio.

Anthony Black of Orlando had 12 points, 8 boards, 4 assists and 2 blocks in the NBA Cup semis, while Jamal Shead had a career high of 18 points, along with 8 assists, versus New York in its prior game.

    "body": "\nA divisional battle takes place on 'Thursday Night Football' as the Seattle Seahawks host the Los Angeles Rams at 8:15 p.m. ET. With Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Puka Nacua ranking first and second, respectively, in receiving yards, NFL DFS stacks with their respective quarterbacks will be a popular daily Fantasy football strategy. However, Sam Darnold had four picks when these teams met in Week 11, while Matthew Stafford had just 130 passing yards. So, your NFL DFS strategy shouldn't bypass the ground games as both squads use multiple running backs.  Potential NFL DFS picks out of the backfield include Kenneth Walker III, Zach Charbonnet, Kyren Williams and Blake Corum. It's all about getting the most value relative to cost when choosing options from the TNF DFS player pool. Before making any Rams vs. Seahawks DFS picks on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings for 'Thursday Night Football', be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure.\nMcClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings. He uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every snap of NFL action, taking factors such as matchups, statistical trends, and injuries into account. This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings, including. In 2023, he finished tied for first in the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once. Anyone who has followed him could be way up.Now, McClure has turned his attention to the 'Thursday Night Football' DFS slate and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. Top NFL DFS picks for Seahawks vs. RamsOne of McClure's top NFL DFS picks for 'Thursday Night Football' is Rams wideout Puka Nacua. Despite missing one full game, and half of another, Nacua is second in the NFL in both receptions (102) and receiving yards (1,367). The third-year receiver is coming off his best game as a pro with a career high of 181 yards on Sunday versus Detroit, which came just a week after posting a 7-167-2 stat line. Nacua had 93 total yards versus Seattle in their matchup earlier this year, and he will be just fine if Davante Adams (hamstring) can't play as Nacua ranked third with 90 receiving yards per game last year without Adams on the team. See who else to roster at SportsLine. Bet Nacua to go Over 7.5 receptions at DraftKings, where new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins:\nMcClure is also rostering Seahawks tight end AJ Barner, who was heavily featured in Week 11 versus the Rams. He had season highs in targets (11) and receptions (10), while his 70 receiving yards were one shy of matching his career high of 71. For the season, Barner has scored 5 touchdowns as part of his 43 catches and 413 receiving yards. With the Rams having a top-10 run defense, and allowing the fewest rushing touchdowns of any team, as opposed to the No. 19 pass defense, Seattle could lean on an aerial attack. That boosts Barner's value, who also scored a touchdown in his last game versus the Rams in the 2024 season. See who else to roster at SportsLine. Bet Barner to go Over 32.5 receiving yards at DraftKings:\nHow to set Rams vs. Seahawks DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Thursday Night Football.'

    "body": "\n        North Texas quarterback Drew Mestemaker is likely to enter the transfer portal once the window opens in January, sources tell CBS Sports' Chris Hummer. Mestemaker will not make his final decision until after North Texas' Dec. 27 showdown against San Diego State in the New Mexico Bowl. Though it makes sense to think that Mestemaker would follow former coach Eric Morris to Oklahoma State if he enters the transfer portal -- especially after he emerged as one of Morris' latest diamond-in-the-rough success stories at quarterback. But the Mean Green star is expected to garner robust interest from quarterback-needy teams, according to CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz. Mestemaker, who didn't start as a varsity quarterback and instead played defensive back at Vandegrift High School in Austin, Texas, joined North Texas' roster as an unheralded walk-on in 2024. He spent most of his true freshman season as a backup but earned his first career start in the 2024 First Responder Bowl after former North Texas quarterback Chandler Morris transferred to Virginia. Mestemaker wowed in his postseason appearance, as he tallied 448 total yards and three touchdowns in a narrow loss to Texas State. He also solidified himself as North Texas' quarterback of the future. \nIt didn't take long for Mestemaker to prove that his bowl start wasn't a fluke. In North Texas' 2025 season opener against Lamar, Mestemaker threw for 329 yards and three touchdowns while completing 75% of his passes. He also logged a touchdown on the ground. That was the first of three games this season in which Mestemaker had at least three touchdowns passing and one touchdown rushing. Mestemaker guided the Mean Green to an 11-1 regular season record and their first appearance in the American Conference Championship Game, where he accounted for 294 yards and two touchdowns through the air. Mestemaker's 4,129 yards led the FBS -- in fact, he was the only FBS quarterback with at least 4,000 yards passing on the season -- and his 31 touchdowns passing tied with Heisman Trophy finalist Julian Sayin of Ohio State and Baylor's Sawyer Robertson for second-most in the nation. \nThe 6-foot-4 and 211-pound Mestemaker still has three years of eligibility, which adds to his appeal as a potential multi-year starter with more room to develop. \n        \n            \n                College football's transfer portal just hit dizzying speeds: What you need to know about big QB shakeup\n                \n                    Chris Hummer                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMestemaker comes from good stock Mestemaker could be the latest former Eric Morris protege to have success in the transfer portal. A former assistant at Texas Tech, where he tutored Patrick Mahomes, Morris was the head coach at Incarnate Word from 2018-21 and the offensive coordinator at Washington State in 2022. At Incarnate Word, he discovered a lightly recruited quarterback prospect named Cam Ward. Ward signed with UIW in 2020 and won the Jerry Rice Award as the most outstanding freshman in the FCS. He followed Morris to Washington State, where he threw for 3,735 yards and 25 touchdowns. \nWhen Morris left to become the coach at North Texas, Ward transferred to Miami. He finished fourth in Heisman Trophy voting and was the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft after leading the FBS with 39 touchdowns passing in his lone season with the Hurricanes. Morris also recruited John Mateer, who is gearing up for a College Football Playoff run with Oklahoma, and Emmett Brown, who threw for 16 touchdowns at San Jose State last season, while he was at Washington State. Morris' first starter at North Texas, Chandler Morris, transferred to Virginia ahead of the 2025 season. Chandler Morris guided the Cavaliers to their first 10-win regular season since 1989 with 2,802 yards and 18 touchdowns passing. \n            ",

So, I'm not complaining or criticizing. But it is interesting that the Blue Devils have largely been omitted from the No. 1 conversation even though they're A) Duke, B) 10-0 with wins over Michigan State, Florida, Kansas and Arkansas, C) led by the best player in the sport (Cameron Boozer), and D) No. 1 at MasseyRatings.com.\n        \n            \n                Trotter's Trends: Ohio State's Bruce Thornton stands alone, Kentucky's new plan and vital role players\n                \n                    Isaac Trotter                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDuke did get first-place votes in this week's AP poll from Chris Lea, Percy Allen and Seth Davis -- but that amounts to just 4.9% of all first-place votes. Again, I'm not complaining or criticizing. Duke is No. 3 in Tuesday morning's updated CBS Sports Top 25 And 1 daily college basketball rankings; that's the same place Jon Scheyer's team is in the AP poll. I just think that if we would've known on the opening day of the season that Duke would start 10-0 with four wins over preseason Top 25 teams, and be led by a freshman who is running away with the national player of the year race, most of us would've assumed the Blue Devils would be ranked No. 1 heading into Tuesday night's game with Lipscomb. -- but they're not, which is probably just a testament to the similarly impressive and undefeated starts Michigan and Arizona have also provided.\nEither way, there are now seven undefeated teams remaining in college basketball -- Michigan, Arizona, Duke, Iowa State, Nebraska, Vanderbilt and ... Miami-Ohio! But the Redhawks' perfect record could be in jeopardy late Tuesday considering they're 1.5-point underdogs at Wright State.

    "body": "\n        The Green Bay Packers' Super Bowl dreams took a hit on Sunday, when star pass rusher Micah Parsons went down with a torn ACL in the Week 15 loss to the Denver Broncos. The Packers traded two first-round picks and defensive tackle Kenny Clark to the Dallas Cowboys this offseason for Parsons, and signed him to a four-year, $188 million extension. Green Bay was all-in for contending this season, but will have to move forward without its best defensive player.Who won and who lost the Parsons trade will be debated for years to come, but even Cowboys owner Jerry Jones feels bad that his former star player went down with a season-ending injury. He was asked about the situation during an interview on 105.3 The Fan on Tuesday. \"I'm sad for Micah. That's quite a challenge. I wish him the very best on his recovery,\" Jones said, via The Athletic. \"Michael Irvin said when he had his big surgery during, I think, his second year with the Cowboys, he said he realized what football really did mean to him. And he said the surgery really launched him into the best part of his career, because he got to feel what it might look like not to play again. There's a lot of ways you can couch this thing. But, Micah, I wish you the very best.\"\nParsons was involved in a very public contract standoff with the Cowboys this offseason, and it was chock-full of drama. Jones attempted to negotiate the historic extension outside the presence of Parsons' agent, and the Cowboys brass rubbed Parsons' camp the wrong way with several comments. For example, Jerry Jones lamented the fact that Parsons missed several games in 2024, while Stephen Jones said Parsons \"has to want to be paid.\" It all led to Parsons requesting a trade, and that trade came to fruition on Aug. 28.In his first season as a Packer, Parsons recorded 41 tackles, 12.5 sacks, two forced fumbles and 26 QB hits. He became the first player since sacks became an official stat in 1982 to begin a career with five seasons of at least 12 sacks, and was just 1.5 sacks away from matching his career-high of 14.\nJones is probably happy Parsons is not leading the Packers to a Super Bowl in his first season with Green Bay, but it wasn't very long ago where Parsons was one of Jones' favorite players that he regarded as key to the Cowboys' success.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Miami Dolphins were eliminated from playoff contention on Monday night, as they were defeated by Aaron Rodgers and the Pittsburgh Steelers, 28-15. The Dolphins entered this prime-time matchup riding a four-game winning streak, but were simply beat down by a better team. The status of starting quarterback Tua Tagovailoa is again being questioned, as he completed 22 of 28 passes for 253 yards, two touchdowns and an interception on Monday night. The box score doesn't tell the entire story. Tagovailoa's two passing touchdowns came in the fourth quarter when Miami was already trailing by double digits, and the Dolphins went a putrid 2 of 8 on third downs.Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel was asked by reporters on Tuesday if he was considering a quarterback change. McDaniel confirmed he was.  \"Well I think the quarterback play last night was not good enough, and so for me, everything is on the table,\" McDaniel said.Who would McDaniel start if he were to bench Tagovailoa?\n\"Well I think that we are in the process of game-planning for the Cincinnati Bengals, so in that process, we are trying to determine who will give us the best chance to win and I'll probably give you more clarity on that tomorrow, as we are 14 hours removed from the game,\" McDaniel responded. The Dolphins have two other quarterbacks on roster: Former No. 2 overall pick Zach Wilson and rookie Quinn Ewers. If Tagovailoa were to be benched, it may be Wilson who is handed the keys to the offense, as Ewers was the designated QB3 on Monday night.In 14 games this season, Tagovailoa has completed 67.7% of his passes for 2,660 yards, 20 touchdowns and a league-leading 15 interceptions, which also marks a career high. The former Pro Bowler has appeared to have regressed this season. In 2022, Tagovailoa led the NFL in yards per attempt and passer rating. The following year, he led the NFL in passing yards with 4,624. That led to him signing a four-year, $212.4 million extension with $167 million in guarantees in July 2024. \nThe Dolphins cannot easily move on from Tagovailoa if they choose to do so this offseason. The former No. 5 overall pick is signed through 2028, and carries a $56.4 million cap hit in 2026. Still, it's possible this week could mark the end of the Tagovailoa era in Miami. \n            ",

Stephen Curry poured in 48 points and yet it still wasn't enough to beat a Blazers team that had lost six of seven entering that matchup.The loss puts the Warriors (13-14) further behind in the Western Conference standings, as they sit eighth with 4.5 games separating them and the sixth-placed Minnesota Timberwolves. With the team struggling, fans are not only airing their grievances on social media, but taking it to the top of the ladder. \n        \n            \n                NBA Hater Report: Paolo Banchero's blemish is getting bigger; Stephen Curry can't save Warriors\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nJustin Dutari, a 27-year-old fan from Panama, emailed team owner Joe Lacob about his frustrations with the team. In speaking with SF Gate, Dutari said he searched to find Lacob's email, and shot him a message.\"Please do something about this team,\" Dutari's email said. \"What [does] Steph need to do every night to win? Drop 50 points? Team is [in] need of a real second option. Jimmy [Butler's] tools are being underutilized because he is playing as a power forward due to the small position players. We have no true center. I am so frustrated.\"To Dutari's surprise, Lacob replied within two minutes.\n\"You can't be as frustrated as me,\" Lacob wrote in response. \"I am working on it. It's complicated. Style of play. Coaches desires regarding players. League trends. Jimmy is not the problem.\"It's not every day a team owner responds to a fan's email with actual sincerity. And while he only called out Butler by name and said his play has not been the problem, it doesn't take a genius to guess who Lacob is referencing with his \"coaches desires regarding players\" line. The Warriors have had a tumultuous relationship with Jonathan Kuminga for quite some time, and a contract standoff this past summer only heightened things. \n        \n            \n                Warriors and Jonathan Kuminga eye needed breakup, but they still have to wait another month\n                \n                    John Gonzalez                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThrough the first 12 games of the season, it looked like things had been smoothed over between Kuminga and Golden State's coaching staff. He started every game, was averaging nearly 15 points and while the Warriors only went .500 during that stretch, it appeared as though Kuminga found his place in Steve Kerr's lineup.Since then, Kuminga's registered more DNP-CD's than games played and could find himself once again the subject of trade rumors before the Feb. 5 deadline. Trading Kuminga, though, isn't a cure all for the Warriors, unless they're getting someone like Giannis Antetokounmpo in return. That's no guarantee, but it's clear that change has to happen if Golden State wants to be more than just a first-round exit, regardless of how well Curry is playing.\nPerhaps Lacob will take Dutari's words and be more aggressive on the trade market as the deadline approaches. Until then, the Warriors will have to hope they can find a temporary solution to stay afloat in the gauntlet that is the Western Conference.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Recent injuries to Dereck Lively II and Zach Edey may not stand out as especially newsworthy to the casual NBA fan. But to draft enthusiasts and those who study roster trends, the injuries to Lively and Edey (7-foot-1 and 7-foot-3, respectively) are indicative of a concerning recent trend related to the durability, or lack thereof, of young big men.  There were two centers picked in the first round of the 2023 NBA Draft: Victor Wembanyama at No. 1 and Lively at No. 12. As rookies they played 71 and 55 games, respectively. Last year, those numbers dipped to 46 and 36. This year, they are on track to dip again. Wemby just returned from a calf injury, and now has played 13 of 25 games this season. Lively played just seven times before it was announced he would miss the rest of the season after foot surgery.The 2024 draft had better big man depth up front. Alex Sarr (2nd overall), Donovan Clingan (7th), and Edey (9th) were lottery picks. Kel'el Ware (15th), Yves Missi (21st), and DaRon Holmes (22nd) went in the first round. Of those six, only Missi played in more than 67 games as a rookie, while Holmes missed the entire season.In total, those eight first-round draft picks have played in 655 of a possible 1012 regular season games since they were drafted. That's an average of 65% -- or roughly 53 regular-season games per year.\nNow, of course, some of this is contextual, but we can acknowledge that there could be a pattern forming. With six of those 8 players already slotted as starters, there are possible implications not just for those teams, but maybe even for the league as a whole in terms of how they go about assessing potential durability during the draft process.To better explore the issue, we spoke to three anonymous NBA scouts.Why are players, and especially big men, getting hurt more frequently?Last month, Warriors head coach Steve Kerr spoke about the correlation between pace of play and the increase of injuries, saying the Warriors medical staff \"believes that the wear and tear, the speed, the pace, the mileage is factoring into these injuries.\"The burden on big men could be even more daunting, according to league sources. \"We are asking these players with such size, mass, and length to cover more ground and complete more strenuous activities,\" one source said. \"They have to guard and switch on the perimeter and make plays out of ball-screens, which causes much more downhill momentum than just sitting in the post. Throw is the level of athlete, physicality, and pace and there's more tread on their tires as the year progresses.\"\nThat logic seems virtually universal at this point. As Kerr said back in November, \"everyone understands it's easier to score if you beat the opponent down the floor, get out in transition. But when everybody's doing that, the games are much higher-paced. Everyone has to cover out to 25 feet because everybody can shoot 3s.\"If big men in the league are being asked to do more than ever before, that makes durability more important than ever before, and the processes by which some organizations assess that can differ.How do franchises assess risk factors in the pre-draft process?There is a certain baseline that virtually all 30 teams subscribe to. They're all interested in past injuries, procedures or surgeries and lingering issues. It is also standard for draft workouts to include medical exams with team doctors and medical staff.\nBeyond that though, there can be some real variance in the way teams approach this topic in the pre-draft process.\"Every team is different on how deep they dive into injury potential and how risk-averse they are,\" one scout told CBS Sports. \"Like everything else, ultimately teams are going to bet on if the talent outweighs the risk.\"Some teams prefer to leave it up to their medical staff. \"They give us green, yellow or red flags, and if it's yellow, they'll outline what the concerns are. But at the end of the day, we have to make our own judgement.\"\nOthers try to rely on the intel gathering that is part of their scouting process to better illuminate the \"recommendations\" of the medical team. \"Have they missed games? Have they missed practices? How far back do we know that history? Is there a history of injuries in the family background? If he's missed things, is it a real injury or is there a low threshold for pain? Further, does he take care of his body? Is he doing the proper work in the training room and taking advantage of every opportunity?\"Another variable that defers per organization is the level of cohesiveness and trust that exists between the front office and the medical team. \"Having a great medical staff, that you trust, is a huge factor in the draft process, especially when you get guys in the building.\" For the best front offices, that aspire to win the margins in every area across the organization, the medical team is just another such category.What's interesting, though, is that while the front office, and ultimately the GM (or head of basketball operations), is dependent on the medical team's recommendations to make the best decisions possible, the amount of control a GM has over his medical team can vary by organization. While there are some executives that have the authority to make any changes they want, when asked if any GM could replace members of his medical team or go out and recruit more qualified ones, one scout answered, \"I don't see that happening [everywhere].\"\nBeyond the organizational differences in process, the way in which the final decision is executed can also vary by team. \"Some owners want final say, and it is incumbent on the front office to sell their vision.\" Others, let the final draft day decisions be made by the head of the front office, but even then, personal context is important. The more job security the GM has, the more latitude he has to take chances. \"For some GMs, if the wrong guy gets injured, it could be a reason why they get fired. The more secure GMs can say 'F it, let's do it.'\"Of course, those more secure GMs are probably the same ones who have the freedom to build the best medical teams, the most thorough scouting intel, and the best practices of organizational collaboration and growth.What's next for Lively and the Mavs?In the wake of Nico Harrison's departure, the Mavericks don't have a long-term solution about who is running their front office, and apparently won't have one until the offseason. Michael Finley and Matt Riccardi are being called Interim Co-General Managers until then. Simultaneously, now minority owner Mark Cuban is getting input again, while there is speculation that head coach Jason Kidd could also be in consideration for the GM job. In other words, there are way too many cooks in the kitchen, and the person with ultimately authority -- majority owner Patrick Dumont -- hasn't shown the basketball knowledge or context to make these strategic decisions.\nThe lack of organizational leadership or hierarchy comes at a critical time for shaping the future of the franchise. With Harrison's vision of building a title contender around Davis and Kyrie Irving now rarely viewed as than more than the butt of a bad joke, expediting the rebuilding process around Cooper Flagg should be the top priority.The challenge with that though is that outside of this upcoming 2026 draft, the Mavs don't control their own first-round pick again until 2031. The 2027 pick goes to Charlotte if it's not in the top two. OKC has a right to swap in 2028. Houston has the right to swap in 2029 (although Dallas owns an unprotected first from the Lakers), and San Antonio or Minnesota may have swap rights in 2030. In other words, the Mavs are incentivized to lose now, which is why there is speculation around potential deals for Anthony Davis.\n        \n            \n                Ultimate NBA trade guide: 100 candidates who could move as basketball trade season unofficially begins\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nFurther complicating matters is that Lively, who is now out for the season, is eligible for an extension this summer. If not, he's headed toward restricted free agency in the summer of 2027. Two years ago, the idea of not extending Lively would have been almost inconceivable as the rookie played a key role in the Mavs run to the NBA Finals while blocking shots, being all over the offensive glass, exceptionally efficient at the rim, and a great lob partner for Luka Dončić. Now, his archetype could still be hugely valuable alongside Flagg, especially because of their shared Duke lineage and that Lively is viewed as such a great culture guy. The present reality though is his future is just as unclear as who will have ultimate decision-making authority from the front office.\nWhat's next for Edey and the Grizzlies?Let's face it, Dallas and Memphis have more in common that just young, injured big men. They have franchises that are in a state of flux, albeit for different reasons. While Grizzlies' GM Zach Kleiman is viewed in a vastly different light than Harrison was across the league, he is facing a snowballing number of challenges, which mostly stem from the status of Ja Morant.Morant just returned from a calf injury that kept him out for almost a month. Before that, his productivity was the lowest it had been since his rookie season, his lack of effort glaring enough that it was called out on an Amazon Prime broadcast, and his public comments about the current coaching staff only making matters worse. Combine that with some off-the-court issues, and Morant's days in Memphis now seem numbered, but moving on from their point guard means essentially a complete course correction for the franchise. We saw the first evidence of that with this summer's Desmond Bane deal, but trading Morant would mark an undeniable new path that could spur additional roster decisions.The silver lining for the Grizzlies is that they've aced the last two drafts, and thus already starting acquiring young assets, of which Edey is clearly one. The former Purdue big man's transition to the NBA has been far easier than most anticipated, when he's healthy. In that same 2024 draft, they came up with two second round steals, selecting Jaylen Wells at 39 and trading for the rights to Cam Spencer at 53. Wells was named NBA All-Rookie First Team last year and most recently has averaged 18 points per game over his last eight. Spencer is averaging 11 points and 4 assists through 25 games this season while posting 48/45/94 shooting splits. It was more of the same in the most recent draft, as they took Cedric Coward at 11, who already looks like a long-term building block after putting up 14 points, 6 boards, and 3 assists through his first 25 NBA games.\nFor Edey in particular, durability has always been a talking point because of his sheer size, even by NBA standards. His most recent setback, which his agent, Mark Bartelstein, described as \"a management plan to optimize Zach's long-term health in consultation with the Grizzlies and medical experts,\" doesn't appear to change any of that. Bartelstein added that, \"Following this step, the short, and long-term, prognosis for Zach is excellent.\" The reality though is that Memphis is smart enough to know that drafting Edey would require extra layers of medical care over the years. Simultaneously, it would also dictate some roster and style of play considerations as even the best version of Edey isn't going to be better suited in specific defensive coverages and schemes.Again, none of that has changed, but has changed is the conversation about his ultimate ceiling in the league, given how dominant he's been in spurts. Ironically, it's that accelerated growth, along with that of Coward, Wells, and Spencer, which may actually make it that much easier to turn the page on the next iteration of the Grizzlies, however different that may end up being. \n            ",

They are definitely trending the right direction. RJ Harvey was as well before his Week 15 injury. He is one of three injured backs we will be watching closely heading into Week 16.Harvey left Week 15 with a rib injury, and like Zonovan Knight and Devin Neal, he is questionable for Week 16 as of Tuesday morning. Thankfully, if the ribs are okay to play, we probably don't have as much reinjury risk as we would with a hamstring. In other words, if Harvey goes, he is a start, even in a difficult matchup against Jacksonville. If Harvey is out, like we are currently projecting, I would expect a committee approach led by Jaleel McLaughlin. As of Tuesday morning, I have McLaughlin projected for 16 touches and 11.5 full PPR Fantasy points. That would make him a flex, not a starter, but someone who should be added off waivers.Knight also left in Week 15, and we got some of the best clarity we have had in this backfield since James Conner's injury. Michael carter played 79.4% of the offensive snaps, handled 66.7% of the team's rush attempts, and had a 10% target share. This week, the Cardinals face a Falcons defense that has given up 21.8 PPR FPPG to running backs. If Knight is out, Carter could score you 15 Fantasy points and be a top 20 running back. He is likely the best waiver wire add at any position unless we get news that Knight is okay before waivers run.Finally, the Saints lost Devin Neal after he scored a touchdown in Week 15. This is a hamstring injury, which makes me extremely worried even if he tries to play this week. The Saints are home favorites, but the Jets just held Travis Etienne to 2.67 yards per carry. View Neal as a low-end RB2 if he tries to go. If he's out, this will be another committee with Audric Estime and Evan Hull splitting duties. We would not want to start either one.Now let's get to the rest of the Week 16 RB Preview:\n\n        Week 16 RB Preview\n    \n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    RB Preview\n                \n                            \n                    Numbers to know\n                \n                    \n            3.43 -- The Lions are giving up 3.43 catches per game to running backs, the second-lowest mark in the league.

the starter, and I would not be surprised if Carter sees a larger share of the snaps and work than Knight did. Last week, Carter was RB19 against the Texans with 18 touches and 13.4 PPR Fantasy points. That is very close to what I project for him this week if Knight is out.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        DEN\n                    \n                         \n                        Denver\n                    \n                                            • #38\n                                            \n                                            Age: 25\n                                                                        • Experience: 3 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        JAC\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    DEN -3\n                                    O/U 45.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS RB\n                                \n                                4th\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    RB RNK\n                                \n                                36th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                24%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    69\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    3\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    10\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    1\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    3.5\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                This is a bad matchup, and we aren't sure yet that Harvey will miss Week 16. So don't get too excited. McLaughlin has 10 games in his career with at least 10 touches. In those games, he has averaged 10.2 PPR Fantasy points, but he only actually scored double-digits in three of 10 games. He is a flex at best if Harvey is out.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    RB Preview\n                \n                            \n

His coach says he could have come back into the game. For that reason, we are ranking him this week, in a home game, as a 14.5-point favorite, with an implied total of 26. This is the kind of guy who should be chalk, but he just was, and it didn't pay off. I expect Fantasy managers will look somewhere else in DFS this week, which makes Marks a great contrarian play.\n            \n            \n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    RB Preview\n                \n                            \n                    Heath's Projections\n                \n                    \n            My full set of Week 16 Fantasy football projections for every position are now available on SportsLine.

    "body": "\nWe have just three weeks left in the 2025 NFL regular season, and Week 16 presents plenty of intriguing matchups, including two games on Saturday. After a rough Week 14, favorites bounced back in a big way in Week 15. What does that mean for bettors looking to place NFL money line parlays this week? NFL betting expert Jeff Hochman has put together two three-leg money line parlays for Week 16, with one consisting solely of favorites, and the other of three underdogs. NFL three-team favorite money line parlay benefitsBetting heavy favorites can be a solid strategy if you want to bet on a three-team NFL money line parlay. This approach focuses on teams with odds of -150 or better, which means you lean toward high-probability outcomes. By pairing three teams that usually have odds between -150 and -350 or even higher, you're not only aiming for consistent, modest returns, but you're also stacking the deck in your favor for a higher chance of winning. Remember that you can still parlay a favorite with odds of -140 or less to avoid laying 2.5 points, which can significantly impact your chances of winning. Remember, you have to win all three legs for a successful wager.According to BetMGM data, NFL money line favorites at -115 or shorter posted a 68% win percentage in 2023 and a 66.5% rate in 2022. Over the six-season period from 2018-24, NFL money line favorites maintained a 66.6% win rate (1,013-508-7). The strength of favorites correlates directly with their odds. In sports betting, if you see teams with odds between -150 and -200, they generally have a solid chance of winning with around a 60-65% success rate. Teams that are even bigger favorites with odds from -250 to -400 tend to be more reliable, showing win rates of about 70% to 80%. The 2024 NFL season stood out for favorites, with an overall win rate hitting 71.8%.In Week 15, NFL betting favorites bounced back after a disappointing Week 14, posting an impressive 11-5 record. This season, favorites have now secured 152 wins out of 223 games, sustaining a strong 68.1% success rate. What can we expect in Week 16? Will the favorites continue their streak, or will underdogs rise to the occasion? Check out Jeff's top money line parlays featuring both favorites and underdogs.Week 16 NFL money line favorites parlay\nDetroit Lions over Pittsburgh Steelers\nThe Detroit Lions have alternated wins and losses the past 10 games. They are coming off a loss, falling 41-34 as 5.5-point road underdogs against the Rams. Pittsburgh is coming off a short week after playing on Monday Night Football. Dan Campbell and Co. have won 15 consecutive regular-season games immediately following a loss. The Lions have not dropped back-to-back games since Weeks 7 and 8 of the 2022 season, and their offensive efficiency (6.2 yards per play, tied for first) starkly contrasts with Pittsburgh's defensive metrics (5.4 yards allowed per play). Detroit ranks first in the NFL in points per game at 30.6, while Pittsburgh allows 23.3 points per game. The Lions also rank 10 spots higher in total DVOA.Jared Goff played well in Detroit's loss to Los Angeles, completing 25 of his 32 passes (78.1%) for 338 yards and three touchdowns. Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jameson Williams both had strong games against the Rams' secondary. Detroit's defensive line consistently pressures quarterbacks -- the Lions sack opponents at a 9.52% rate, fourth-best in the NFL. Given Aaron Rodgers' limited mobility at this stage of his career, Detroit's pass rush should create problems.Pittsburgh will be without T.J. Watt, who had surgery on Dec. 12 to repair a partially collapsed lung, and he is expected to miss multiple weeks. The Steelers have managed to win more than two consecutive games only once this season, and that was following their bye week. The Steelers allow 120.9 rush yards per game (19th), which could benefit Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery. Gibbs averaged 2.9 yards per rush in his last game. I would take a long look at his rushing props to go \"Over.\" Take the Lions in this smash-mouth spot at home.Tampa Bay Buccaneers over Carolina Panthers \nTampa Bay's sack differential advantage (+0.2 vs. -0.6 per game) will be critical against a Carolina offense that's been vulnerable under duress. The Panthers allow 31 sacks (tied with the Buccaneers) but generate only 23 sacks themselves -- a massive negative swing. While both teams are struggling (Bucs on a two-game losing streak, Panthers alternating wins and losses), Tampa Bay has significantly higher-quality wins earlier in the season and has played a more demanding schedule (No. 12 vs. No. 26).The Panthers want to run the ball early and often with Rico Dowdle and Chuba Hubbard. This plays right into the hands of the Bucs' defense, especially with Vita Vea in the middle of that defensive line. Tampa Bay is ranked 10th in rushing yards against, which will force Bryce Young into obvious passing downs.My betting model loves the road team. The Buccaneers have a 6.5-point edge at this line, with projections showing a 9.27-point margin and 78.3% win probability. I have more confidence playing Tampa Bay on the money line considering this is a division matchup. The Panthers have defensive strengths in specific areas (red zone and pass efficiency) but lack the pass-rush impact or offensive firepower to consistently move the ball against a Buccaneers team that should dominate time of possession and field position. Tampa Bay also benefits from extra preparation time following last Thursday's debacle -- and the Bucs have dominated this matchup, winning nine of the last 10 meetings. I like Baker Mayfield and Co. to bounce back in this spot.Denver Broncos over Jacksonville Jaguars\nThe Denver current market line of -3 is roughly 2.5 to 3.5 points softer than advanced metrics suggest. According to my model, Denver would be favored by 5.5 to 6 points on a neutral field (-200). Add in the well-established home-field advantage at Mile High (about +2.8 points), and the true line should be closer to Denver -7 or -8.5. (-350 to -400). At -3, Broncos backers are getting significant value. All we need is an outright victory.Denver's defense is stifling in the red zone, allowing touchdowns on just 38.4% of opponent trips -- the best in the NFL. This is a nightmare for Jacksonville, as Trevor Lawrence's QBR is 51.8 (21st). While Lawrence can move the ball, Denver's red zone efficiency is the single largest predictive edge in this matchup. The Broncos also excel at ending drives. Opponents convert on third down just 31.9% of the time against Denver, the top mark in the league. On the other hand, Jacksonville's offense is below average on third downs (25th at 36.8%). The Jaguars will find it tough to sustain drives, which will compound their red-zone challenges.Denver owns the NFL's second-best pass rush, notching sacks on 10.5% of opponent dropbacks. With Jacksonville's offensive line riddled by injuries and multiple starters questionable, Trevor Lawrence is likely to face relentless pressure from all angles -- even without Denver needing to blitz. Historically, Lawrence's interception rate spikes when he's hurried, giving the Broncos a prime opportunity to force game-changing turnovers.Consistency is often overlooked, but it is a vital metric this late in the season. Denver ranks third in the league with an 8.5 consistency rating, executing their game plan with precision at home. Jacksonville's volatility (12.3 rating, 23rd overall) makes it unpredictable and more prone to lapses, especially on the road. Adding to their challenges, Jacksonville will be playing just its second outdoor road game since late September. Expect the Broncos to capitalize and secure another win.NFL three-team underdog money line parlay benefitsA very popular option is available if you're willing to take on a bit more risk for a potentially higher reward. Underdog money line parlays offer the largest possible payouts in the NFL betting landscape. Combining three underdogs with odds like +200, +150, and +300 could result in payouts exceeding 20-to-1 or higher. The best part is that, due to the high payouts, underdog parlays can still be profitable even when winning only a small percentage of bets. For example, hitting just one of several large underdog parlays could offset multiple losses and generate overall profit. NFL underdogs have historically outperformed expectations in specific situations, with home underdogs of +2 to +3 winning outright 46-48% of the time.Week 16 NFL money line underdog parlay\nTennessee Titans over Kansas City Chiefs \nI promised never to take the Tennessee Titans on these pages, but this is a unique spot after Patrick Mahomes' unfortunate torn ACL that will keep him out for at least a calendar year. Gardner Minshew, a five-year journeyman backup, takes over as the Chiefs' starter. This transition is significant: Minshew had not thrown a pass all season before Week 15, when he threw an interception on his first attempt. His career record stands at 17-29, putting him well below league-average. The Chiefs' offense -- seventh in yards per game at 357.9 yards -- was already built around Mahomes' arm talent and improvisational ability.The Chiefs have been officially eliminated from playoff contention, the first playoff miss since 2014. This elimination removes any competitive incentive for the organization. When a team enters a game mathematically eliminated from the postseason, players and coaches shift into a \"just finish the season\" mentality. Kansas City still possesses superior talent at nearly every position and has a proven offensive system (despite a quarterback downgrade).On the surface, the Titans face a tanking disincentive, and additional wins hurt their draft positioning. However, interim head coach Mike McCoy has stated the team maintains a \"burning desire to win\" regardless of its 2-10 record. This creates an unpredictable dynamic where Tennessee might be unusually energized to beat a historically superior opponent while Kansas City plays out the string. After seeing their playoff hopes dashed last week, it's common for teams in this spot to lack energy and struggle to get motivated.Los Angeles Chargers over Dallas Cowboys \nStart with the basics: the Chargers have outscored opponents by 31 points this season. The Cowboys, on the other hand, have been outscored by nine. That 40-point difference says a lot about where these teams stand. The Chargers also average +0.3 more yards per play on offense versus defense (12th in the league), while Dallas breaks even (0.0, 29th). Both teams have really good kickers and banged-up offensive lines. Los Angeles is able to game plan around it, while Dallas seems to struggle when it matters most.There are three glaring differences in this matchup. The Chargers allow 279.1 yards per game (second best) while the Cowboys allow 374.9 yards per game (29th). Against Justin Herbert's balanced offense and the Chargers' strong receivers, this is catastrophic for Dallas. Additionally, the Chargers' opponent passer rating of 71.1 (best in league) versus the Cowboys' 109.1 (worst in the league) tells the story. Finally, the Chargers are ranked fifth in red zone defense while the Cowboys are ranked 30th.Dallas' secondary is historically bad this season, especially when the defensive front doesn't generate pressure on opposing quarterbacks. Jim Harbaugh is coaching up his offensive line despite all the injuries. I have all the confidence in the Chargers' coaching staff against the Cowboys' coaches. The Chargers have posted an impressive 14-4 record since Week 8 over the past two seasons. I would expect more of the same.New England Patriots over Baltimore Ravens\nMy model gives the New England Patriots a 56% chance of winning outright with a projected final score of 27-25. The Patriots have been a juggernaut on the road (6-0), flourishing away from home. Conversely, the Ravens have been a liability at M&T Bank Stadium this season, posting a 3-5 home record.New England has a top-seven scoring defense (19.7 PPG allowed), while Baltimore's defense has regressed to league average (22.9 PPG allowed, ranking 15th). Drake Maye has emerged as an MVP-caliber talent, completing a league-leading 70.9% of his passes for 3,567 yards with 23 touchdowns and only six interceptions. His passer rating sits at 109.1, and he's added 362 rushing yards and four touchdowns on the ground. Meanwhile, Lamar Jackson's recent form represents the inverse trajectory -- his completion percentage has plummeted to 56%, and he's averaging 7.0 yards per attempt with a passer rating of just 69.7 over his last four games.The Ravens have struggled under the lights, managing just a 1-3 record in prime-time games and going winless (0-2) at home. Meanwhile, the Patriots have thrived in the spotlight, winning all three of their prime-time matchups so far. The Patriots may have let a 21-point lead slip away against the Bills last week, but they've bounced back from setbacks all year and still sit atop the AFC East with an 11-3 record. The loss provides extra motivation for the Pats. Mike Vrabel has an impressive 33-16 career record in games immediately following a loss as an NFL head coach, between his time with the Tennessee Titans and his current squad.\n            ",

    "body": "\nWhen the Colorado Avalanche suffered their second regulation loss of the 2025-26 NHL season on Dec. 4, some thought the team would begin coming back to Earth after its 19-1-6 start. But head coach Jared Bednar's club is proving it has no intention of taking its foot off the gas.Colorado has followed its 6-3 setback against the New York Islanders with a five-game point streak, winning four contests while dropping the other in a shootout. The Avalanche opened Week 10 with that 4-3 defeat in Nashville, earning the point after defenseman Cale Makar scored the game-tying goal with eight seconds remaining in the third period, but returned home to post wins against the reigning Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers and Predators to keep the train rolling.The Avalanche top the NHL with 53 points but are only four in front of the Dallas Stars, who split their four contests last week. Three other teams are climbing the ladder thanks to strong performances, however, as the Carolina Hurricanes won all four of their games to increase their point total to 44 while the Minnesota Wild and New York Islanders both went 3-0-0 to give them 43 and 41 points, respectively.Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Kings failed to record a victory in Week 10, losing overtime decisions to the Seattle Kraken and Calgary Flames before falling to Dallas in regulation to drop out of this week's top 10 ratings. Los Angeles has lost nine of its last 13 contests, although it earned a point in five of those setbacks.Each week during the season, I'll rank the league's top 10 teams based on both the previous week's performances and overall body of work in 2025-26. I'll also give brief synopsis for each club that explains why they're ranked where they are.Let's dive into the power ratings entering Week 11 of the 2025-26 NHL season and highlight a few of the teams' notable accomplishments.NHL Week 11 power ratings 1. Colorado Avalanche (2-0-1 in Week 10; 23-2-7 overall)The Avalanche earned five out of a possible six points last week, and it still boggles my mind that they've failed to record one only twice in their first 32 games of the season. The Boston Bruins set NHL records with 65 wins and 135 points in 2022-23 but suffered four regulation losses in their first 26 contests. The 1976-77 Montreal Canadiens finished with a league-record eight regulation losses but dropped two of their first seven games and were 9-3-1 over their first 13 outings. Nathan MacKinnon posted three two-point performances in Week 10 and leads the NHL with 26 goals and 52 points. The 2024 Hart Trophy winner has been kept off the scoresheet just five times this season, as has Cale Makar. A two-time Norris Trophy recipient, Makar is riding a six-game point streak and is first among all defensemen in assists (28) and points (38) while ranking second in goals (10). Meanwhile, Martin Necas was held without a point by Nashville on Saturday, ending a five-game streak during which he racked up a goal and nine assists.2. Carolina Hurricanes (4-0-0; 21-9-2)Carolina's 4-0-0 week might be a bit misleading, as each of its last three victories came in a shootout. But the Hurricanes won the games nonetheless and enter Week 11 atop the Metropolitan Division. And they recorded all four wins without any offensive contribution from Sebastian Aho, who is tied with Seth Jarvis for the team lead with 26 points but is in the midst of a five-game drought. Taylor Hall and Alexander Nikishin were the only three players to land on the scoresheet in three of Carolina's four contests, and the latter is carrying a three-game point streak into the new week. Jarvis was a factor in three of the victories as well, scoring in regulation against the Columbus Blue Jackets and Philadelphia Flyers while netting the decisive shootout goal versus the Washington Capitals.3. Minnesota Wild (3-0-0; 19-9-5)Minnesota is riding a four-game winning streak during which it allowed fewer than three goals in each triumph. Marcus Johansson has been involved offensively amid the run, notching three goals and three assists during a four-game point streak that has followed a five-game dry spell. Joel Eriksson Ek also got on the scoresheet in all four victories after a five-game drought, netting three tallies and setting up four others. Matt Boldy collected two goals and three assists last week to increase his point total to 37 and forge a tie for the team lead with Kirill Kaprizov, who recorded two of each and is tied for third in the NHL with 20 tallies. The 28-year-old Russian left wing became one of only four players in the league to reach the 20-goal plateau thus far this season by converting twice against the Boston Bruins on Sunday. The Wild also received an immediate contribution in that win from 2024 Norris Trophy winner Quinn Hughes, who scored a goal in his team debut two days after being acquired from the Vancouver Canucks.4. Dallas Stars (2-2-0; 22-7-5)One of Minnesota's victories in Week 10 was a 5-2 triumph over the Stars, who split their four games and dropped a few spots in the ratings. Dallas followed that defeat with its first shutout loss of the season, a 4-0 setback against the Panthers, but ended the week with a 4-1 win versus the Los Angeles Kings. Mikko Rantanen racked up three assists in a 4-3 victory over the Winnipeg Jets to extend his point streak to seven games but was blanked in back-to-back outings before netting a tally and setting up another against the Kings. The 29-year-old Finnish right wing is tied for fourth in the NHL with 44 points, while Jason Robertson shares third in goals with 20 after scoring twice last week. Wyatt Johnston also had a solid week offensively, recording a tally and four assists. Meanwhile, Matt Duchene made his presence felt versus Los Angeles as he registered a goal and an assist. The veteran was held without a point in his first four games back from a concussion that kept him sidelined for 24 contests.5. New York Islanders (3-0-0; 19-11-3)After making their season debut in the ratings prior to Week 9, the Islanders climbed five spots by defeating three strong teams in the Vegas Golden Knights, Anaheim Ducks and Tampa Bay Lightning. Emil Heineman has gone eight games without a point and has notched just one in his last 12 contests but was the team hero last week, as the 24-year-old Swedish left wing scored the decisive goal in shootout wins against Vegas and Tampa Bay. Bo Horvat came up with a two-goal performance versus the Golden Knights but missed the meeting with the Lightning due to a lower-body injury and will begin Week 11 on the sideline. Mathew Barzal notched an assists in all three games last week, while captain Anders Lee scored two goals and set up two others in the Isles' 5-2 triumph over Anaheim.6. Vegas Golden Knights (2-0-1; 16-6-9)Even though captain Mark Stone was kept off the scoresheet for the first time this season on Saturday, the Golden Knights still extended their point streak to seven games (6-0-1) with a 3-2 triumph over the Blue Jackets. The 33-year-old right wing, who missed 16 contests this campaign with an upper-body injury, recorded at least one point in each of his first 14 outings of 2025-26 and ranks fourth on the team with 24. Stone did register a pair of two-point performances in Week 10, setting up two goals in Vegas' shootout loss to the Islanders last Tuesday before scoring twice against the Flyers two days later. Columbus also halted Jack Eichel's run of four straight multi-point efforts, but the 29-year-old center notched an assist in the win to extend his overall point streak to five games. Mitch Marner finished the week with five points after collecting three assists versus the Blue Jackets, whie Pavel Dorofeyev (two goals, one assist) landed on the scoresheet in all three of Vegas' contests last week. 7. Anaheim Ducks (2-2-0; 20-12-1)The Ducks began a five-game road trip last Tuesday with a shootout win over the Pittsburgh Penguins but suffered three-goal losses against the Islanders and New Jersey Devils before posting a 4-1 victory against the New York Rangers. Leo Carlsson netted the decisive tally versus the Penguins and notched a point in each of Anaheim's next three games, while Troy Terry recorded three goals and an assist over the team's first three contests of the week. Cutter Gauthier scored twice against the Rangers to end his four-game drought and take over the team lead with 18 goals, and 19-year-old right wing Beckett Sennecke picked up an assist in the triumph after going back-to-back games without a point for the first time since a four-game dry spell from Oct. 23-31. Defenseman Jackson LaCombe, who netted two tallies and set up another in Week 10, has registered a point in five of his last six outings.8. Detroit Red Wings (2-1-0; 18-12-3)The Red Wings continued to pick up points last week, winning two of their three games over a span of four days. The club has earned at least one point in seven of its last eight contests (5-1-2) after suffering four regulation losses in five outings. Alex DeBrincat registered a pair of three-point performances to grab the team lead with 37 points, while Patrick Kane notched two points twice. DeBrincat scored two goals and set up another in a 4-3 triumph over the Flames last Wednesday and repeated the feat in a 4-0 win against the Chicago Blackhawks three days later as Detroit wrapped up a 4-1-1 road trip. Kane set up two tallies in Calgary before recording a goal and an assist at Chicago.9. Washington Capitals (0-1-1; 18-10-4)Washington only played twice in Week 10 but did not post a victory, losing to Carolina 3-2 in a shootout before falling 5-1 to Winnipeg. Connor McMichael recorded a goal and an assist against the Hurricanes after notching just one point (assist) over his previous five games. Defenseman Rasmus Sandin ended his nine-game point drought with a pair of assists in that contest, while Alex Ovechkin also set up two goals last week. Meanwhile, Jakob Chychrun netted his 12th tally in the loss to Winnipeg, putting him two ahead of Colorado's Makar for the NHL lead among blue-liners.10. Tampa Bay Lightning (2-1-1; 18-12-3)The Lightning endured a miserable Week 9 as they scored a total of four goals while suffering four regulation losses. They recovered by earning points in the first three of their four games last week, defeating the Montreal Canadiens and Devils by a combined score of 14-5 before dropping a 3-2 decision to the Islanders in a shootout, but finished with a 5-2 loss to Florida. Nikita Kucherov collected a goal and seven assists, Jake Guentzel netted a tally and set up four others and Oliver Bjorkstrand doubled his point total for the season with two goals and three assists. Brayden Point landed on the scoresheet in all four of Tampa Bay's contests, registering two goals and five assists, and defenseman Darren Raddysh did the same with four tallies and a pair of assists. The 29-year-old Raddysh is having a tremendous season offensively as he already has set a career high with seven goals and ranks fourth on the team with 24 points.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        UCLA freshman Sienna Betts is expected to make her collegiate debut when the Bruins take on Cal Poly on Tuesday night. Fans have been eagerly waiting for this moment, but it's hard to imagine anyone will be prouder than her older sister Lauren Betts.\"Yeah, I'm super excited for Sienna. This has been a really up-and-down process for her,\" Betts said during the USA Basketball training camp. \"Obviously, no one wants to be injured, especially going into your first year in college. So she's been amazing. She's been putting in a lot of hard work.\"I'm so excited for her to get the opportunity to step on the floor for the first time because she's really had an amazing attitude throughout all of this. We've all been there for her, and the staff has been amazing. So as her older sister I just can't wait to watch her experience that for the first time, and I'm just super proud of her. And yeah, just really looking forward to it.\"Sienna has yet to play a game as a Bruin due to a left leg injury that happened during a scrimmage against UC Riverside on Oct. 19. She will likely ease into things and be on a minutes restriction during her debut. \nThe delay was not easy to deal with but things are finally looking up. On Tuesday, Sienna shared a post on Instagram with the caption \"better days :)\" Lauren replied with a LeBron James meme saying, \"It's about damn time.\"Although her sister is the star UCLA player who led the team to a Final Four appearance, Sienna won't be living in her shadow. The 6-foot-4 forward was the No. 2 player in the 247Sports class of 2025 rankings. She averaged 23 points and 16.5 rebounds per game during her senior year at Grandview High School in Colorado and 247Sports Director of women's basketball scouting Brandon Clay described her as \"unquestionably the top frontcourt option in the rising senior class.\"We have yet to see her as a college freshman but head coach Cori Close already knows Sienna will be competing for playing time.\n\"I think Sienna is extremely smart. She has an incredibly high IQ. She has very good instincts and she's incredibly competitive,\" Close said. \"I would expect that she'll be really mad at me when I take her off the court because she'll just want more and more and more. My biggest hope for her is that she'll give herself some grace. She has such high expectations for herself, which is part of what makes her so good.\"The Bruins are currently ranked No. 4 in the nation with their only loss coming at the hands of No. 2 Texas in November. Having Sienna back will add depth to an already dangerous team. She has been itching to be a part of the action, but her older sister has been there to remind her to take her time with the recovery process. \"She's the impatient one,\" Lauren said. \"I'm just really super proud of her, and it's going to be a really special moment to have her back on the floor. It's a really up and down process. Like I said, she's just very impatient, so I'm just excited for her get to be on the court. We're all just so thankful to have her on the team. She's gonna be a great addition.\"\n            ",

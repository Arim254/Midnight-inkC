    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL playoffs are set with Denver and Seattle the top seeds in their respective conferences. Thus, they won't partake in the 2026 Wild Card Weekend NFL schedule but several other Super Bowl contenders are available to make Wild Card NFL bets on. Teams like the Texans and Jaguars enter in on win streaks of nine and eight games, respectively, and could be highly sought after with NFL picks. Meanwhile, Green Bay is riding a four-game losing streak and is a 1.5-point underdog to the Bears on Saturday night, per the latest Wild Card Weekend NFL odds.Those two split their regular season matchups as they'll tangle in the postseason for just the third time ever. The NFL line for that game matches Bills vs. Jaguars (+1.5) as the slimmest of the Wild Card Weekend NFL spreads, while the largest has the Rams favored by 10 points over the Panthers. Other spreads include 49ers vs. Eagles (-4.5), Chargers vs. Patriots (-3.5) and Steelers vs. Texans (-3.5). All of the updated Wild Card Weekend NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Wild Card Weekend NFL picks now.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

These teams have the same 9-8 spread record, but Pittsburgh is 4-1 ATS over its last five, while Houston has failed to cover in two of its last three. While Houston has an elite defense, it allowed its most points (30) all year in Week 18 to a Colts team with a fourth-string rookie quarterback, which is no comparison to an Aaron Rodgers-led unit getting back a rested DK Metcalf. As for C.J. Stroud, he is 0-2 on the road in his playoffs career, failing to account for a touchdown in either loss. The Steelers are forecasted to cover over 50% of the time, with the Over hitting in well over 50% of simulations. See which other teams to pick here, and bet the Steelers using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nHow to make Wild Card NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Wild Card Weekend NFL schedule and just revealed three teams projected to outright win over 60% of the time, potentially giving you a huge payday.

    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL playoffs are here as six matchups are set to unfold over the course of Saturday, Sunday and Monday. The latest Wild Card Weekend NFL odds from DraftKings Sportsbook lists the Rams at -10.5 vs. the Panthers and the Bears at -1 vs. the Packers on Saturday. On Sunday, the latest NFL lines have the Bills at -1.5 vs. the Jaguars, the Eagles at -3.5 vs. the 49ers, and the Patriots at -3.5 vs. the Chargers. A playoff edition of 'Monday Night Football' concludes the slate with the Texans favored by 3.5 points on the road against the Steelers. The over/under for Texans vs. Steelers is 39.5 points, the lowest on the NFL odds board. SportsLine's Eric Cohen has revealed his exact score prediction for each game to help you formulate spread, over/under, money-line and even NFL best bets as Wild Card Weekend approaches.A SportsLine expert and CBS on-air talent, Cohen has evaluated the entire NFL playoff slate and delivers score predictions and logic for each matchup. Cohen went 180-91-1 (66%) on his NFL straight-up picks this season, and was a sizzling 10-3 (77%) on his straight-up NFL playoff picks last season. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now he's turned his attention to the 2026 NFL Wild Card Weekend, studied each matchup in depth, and has revealed his exact NFL score predictions for each game. All NFL betting lines via DraftKings Sportsbook.Los Angeles Rams (-10.5) at Carolina Panthers\n\"Carolina won this matchup on November 30, 31-28, in one of the more impactful upsets for both teams in the NFL this season,\" Cohen said. \"That's not happening again. While Sean McVay's team hasn't looked great lately, they'll exact serious revenge as a double-digit road favorite on Saturday. The Panthers have absolutely no business being in the playoffs and it's going to be a wake up call to the other teams in the conference. I would be mildly surprised if this wasn't a blowout.\"Pick: Rams 34, Panthers 12Green Bay Packers at Chicago Bears (-1)\n\"This will be the NFC North rivals' third matchup since December 7,\" Cohen said. \"Green Bay held on by a touchdown in the first one, before blowing a 10 point lead in the final two minutes and falling in overtime. I believe that Packers coach Matt LaFleur's job is on the line. While his team makes the playoffs just about every season, they have lost four of their last five in the postseason and finished the 2025 regular season on a four game losing streak. I'm just not sure the Bears are ready for this kind of pressure, especially against a rested Green Bay team. In another thriller on Saturday night, the Packers exact a matter of revenge for the Week 16 collapse.\"Pick: Packers 23, Bears 21Buffalo Bills (-1.5) at Jacksonville Jaguars\n\"Winners of nine of their last 10 games, I have a hard time picking against Jacksonville at home,\" Cohen said. \"Buffalo's passing game is devoid of weapons and the Jaguars boast the NFL's top rush defense to slow Josh Allen and James Cook. While Allen and the Bills are 5-0 in the Wild Card Round since 2020, all five of those games have been at home. Trevor Lawrence has played at an MVP level since November and it will continue this weekend. The Jaguars win on a walk-off Cam Little field goal from 50-plus yards. If this result plays out as I anticipate, Sean McDermott won't be back to coach Buffalo next season.\"Pick: Jaguars 27, Bills 24San Francisco 49ers at Philadelphia Eagles (-3.5)\n\"With Philadelphia only giving 3.5 points on the early line, this is my favorite spread play of the Wild Card games,\" Cohen said. \"This is a matchup between the two NFC teams who have played in the last three Super Bowls, but I don't trust San Francisco's defense to hold up against the Eagles' potent receivers and Saquon Barkley on the ground. San Francisco had potentially three straight home games in front of them with a win against Seattle in Week 18. Now, after an offensive dud against the Seahawks, their season ends in disappointment in the City of Brotherly Love.\"Pick: Eagles 27, 49ers 21Los Angeles Chargers at New England Patriots (-3.5)\n\"My top play in this game is the Under 45.5 (though I may buy it up a few points in my weekend parlays),\" Cohen said. \"Both of these teams give up less than 21 points per game so don't expect fireworks. Of the Patriots' 14 wins, only three came against playoff teams (Panthers, Bills, Ravens) so they might have benefitted from a ridiculously weak schedule. Then again, the Chargers only beat two playoff teams (Broncos, Eagles), so I can't use that to their advantage. In their second playoffs under Jim Harbaugh (in two years), I think L.A. leads most of the game, with Drake Maye leading a late New England rally. \"Pick: Patriots 23, Chargers 21 Houston Texans (-3.5) at Pittsburgh Steelers \n\"I can't believe Aaron Rodgers found a way in the playoffs yet again,\" Cohen said. \"I have to think this is it for him either way. The Texans' defense should overwhelm the future Hall of Famer and hold Pittsburgh fairly in check. Entering the playoffs on a nine game winning streak and facing a team who I believe is a class below them, I think Houston's offense does enough to win. One betting note: Houston kicker Ka'imi Fairbairn had multiple field goal attempts in all 15 games he played in this season and hit his Over 1.5 made FGs in 14/15. Whatever the juice is, lay it in this game.\"Pick: Texans 23, Steelers 10How to get more NFL Wild Card Weekend picksSportsLine's model has simulated every Wild Card Weekend Game 10,000 times and revealed its picks.

All 14 teams are vying to get to Super Bowl LX, which is set to be played in Santa Clara, Calif., on Feb. 8.

In total, six teams that failed to make the postseason a year ago will be in the 2026 NFL playoffs, including the Seahawks, Patriots, Bears, 49ers, Jaguars, and Panthers.

    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL playoffs have arrived, and the action kicks off with a two-game slate on Saturday as Wild Card Weekend begins. The first kick Rams vs. Panthers (+10, 46.5) at 4:30 p.m. ET, with the rubber match between the Bears and Packers (-1.5, 45.5) then following at 8 p.m. ET. The NFL DFS player pool will be highlighted by Matthew Stafford, Puka Nacua, Bryce Young, Josh Jacobs, Jordan Love, Caleb Williams and DJ Moore. How should you build your NFL DFS lineups for Saturday's two-game slate, and which sleepers should factor into your NFL DFS strategy? Before making any Saturday NFL DFS picks, be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure.You can also bet props like Jacobs as an anytime TD scorer (-120) using the latest DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:\nMcClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings.

You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. Top NFL DFS picks for Wild Card SaturdayOne of McClure's top NFL DFS picks for Saturday is Nacua. The third-year player leads the NFL with 129 receptions and is second in receiving yards at 1,715. He had 10 receiving touchdowns and one score on the ground as well. He had a solid 6-72 receiving line against the Panthers earlier this season, but will be on the hunt for bigger numbers in this playoff setting. It was actually Davante Adams who burned Carolina with two scores in that game, but with Adams coming off a hamstring injury, the door could be open for a huge evening for Nacua. See who else to roster at SportsLine, and bet Nacua to go Over 91.5 receiving yards at DraftKings Sportsbook:\nMcClure is also building his Saturday NFL DFS strategy around Bears receiver Luther Burden III. The rookie out of Missouri has become a huge part of Chicago's passing attack down the stretch. He's been targeted at least six times in five of the past six games. That span includes an 8-64 game against the Browns and a massive 8-138-1 game against the 49ers. The Packers have given up the 20th-most Fantasy points to opposing receivers this season, and Burden had four receptions for 67 yards against them on Dec. 7. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine, and bet Burden to go Over 43.5 receiving yards at DraftKings:\nHow to set Wild Card Saturday NFL DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on Saturday. This pick could be the difference between winning your tournaments and cash games or going home with nothing. You can only see who it is, and the rest of McClure's NFL DFS picks, at SportsLine.So who is Mike McClure including in his optimal NFL DFS lineups for Saturday, and which under-the-radar player offers huge value? Visit SportsLine now to see optimal NFL DFS picks, NFL DFS rankings, NFL DFS advice and NFL DFS stacks, all from a daily Fantasy expert with more than $2 million in winnings, and find out. \n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Florida secured the most significant transfer portal pickup of the Jon Sumrall era and landed its potential starting quarterback for the 2026 season. Former Georgia Tech quarterback Aaron Philo signed with the Gators, according to CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz and Chris Hummer, and will arrive in Gainesville with three years of eligibility.Philo's signing came on the heels of a visit to Florida. He was on campus over the weekend, per 247Sports, along with one of his old Georgia Tech teammates in wide receiver Bailey Stockton. The three-star prospect and No. 15-ranked quarterback in the transfer portal moved quickly and held his visit immediately after the transfer portal opened on Jan. 2.That Philo made up his mind in short order comes as little surprise given that his offensive coordinator at Georgia Tech, Buster Faulkner, took the same job at Florida last month. Philo spent the first two years of his college football career under Faulkner's tutelage and will rejoin forces with the highly touted coordinator in the SEC, where he could thrive in a system that turned Haynes King into one of the nation's most prolific quarterbacks.\nWhile he brings only a modest amount of playing experience with him to Florida, including only one career start, Philo is regarded as one of the most promising young backups in the nation. He was a three-star recruit out of high school but dazzled with his dual-threat playmaking ability in eight appearances over his freshman and redshirt freshman seasons.Philo made his first career start in Week 2 this season when he filled in for an injured King. The caliber of opponent in that game may have inflated his performance, but it was a notably successful one for Philo, who torched Gardner-Webb to the tune of 373 yards on 21-of-28 passing. He posted a touchdown and an interception in the start. Most impressively, the 373 passing yards were the sixth-most in a single game in Georgia Tech history, the most since 2001 and the most ever by a Yellow Jackets freshman.\nThe Philo-Faulkner pairing has the potential to uplift a Florida offense that sputtered throughout most of Billy Napier's four years atop the program. The Gators ranked No. 111 nationally in scoring in 2025 and never finished higher than No. 44 with Napier calling plays. Georgia Tech, meanwhile, averaged no fewer than 28.9 points per game in any of Faulkner's three years as offensive coordinator.\n            \n    ",

It creates another global stage for our athletes—one that helps fans connect more deeply with them and continues to elevate the visibility and growth of women's golf.\"Details surrounding teams, investors and players are yet to be announced, but the league figures to follow the same format as the men's TGL. Matches will be played at the SoFi Center in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, featuring mic'd up players during matches and, of course, the signature Hammer. WTGL is the latest initiative for the new LPGA commissioner, who is trying to enhance the profile of her tour's star players. One of Kessler's main focuses when taking over the league was to ensure the best LPGA players became household names.\nWTGL not only provides another avenue for golf fans to get to know those players, it will serve as an alternative for stateside stars to play and compete in the United States. Many currently spend their winters competing in Asia.After the Tournament of Champions in Orlando in late January, the LPGA Tour plays its next three events in Thailand, Singapore and China. Some of the Tour's top stars from North America tend to skip those events, so partnering for the launch of WTGL during that winter season may provide an alternative of sorts for players who don't plan to play on the Asian swing. \nThe men's TGL is set to expand in Year 3, adding the Motor City Golf Club out of Detroit in 2027.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL Playoffs begin with Super Wild Card Weekend on Saturday, Jan 10 as the Los Angeles Rams head to Charlotte to face the Carolina Panthers. The bonanza concludes on Monday evening with the Pittsburgh Steelers hosting the Houston Texans. There are six games to choose from when it comes to building out money line parlays for the Wild Card round and SportsLine expert Jeff Hochman has locked in his picks for his three-team play.NFL three-team money line parlay strategyNFL playoff parlay betting is a whole different ball game compared to the regular season. The markets are sharper, the competition is tougher (well, maybe not in Carolina's case) and teams can react unpredictably when the pressure's on. Plus, the same-game parlays are often highly correlated. For example, if you like the Rams to roll over Carolina, it makes sense to look at the Over props for Rams offensive players—they'll likely put up big numbers if your prediction is right.In Week 18, NFL betting favorites went 10-6. However, take these results with a grain of salt, as the final week featured numerous teams either resting starters or \"tanking\" for a better draft pick. Over the entire 2025-26 NFL campaign, favorites won 181 out of 272 games (66.5%), which is well below last season's 71.8% mark. As we reach the NFL postseason, I'm putting together a three-team money line parlay featuring my most confident combination of favorites and underdogs.Week 18 NFL money line favorites parlay\nPhiladelphia Eagles over San Francisco 49ers\nI grabbed this on Sunday night at lower odds, but I think it's still a great bet at this number. Jalen Hurts has statistically played his best football in south Philadelphia. Entering this postseason, he holds an incredible record (19-1 SU) at home against teams with winning records. While the Eagles' offense has been the subject of media scrutiny, their defense under Vic Fangio has quietly become the team's backbone entering January. The Eagles' defensive front (anchored by Jalen Carter and Jordan Davis) is built specifically to disrupt Kyle Shanahan's zone-run scheme. If they can force the 49ers into 3rd-and-longs, they neutralize San Francisco's biggest strength—play-action.The Eagles stand out as the clear favorite here, thanks to their elite pass defense (75.4 opponent passer rating, second in the NFL) and their red zone dominance (70.4% TD rate, best in the league), plus the boost of home field advantage (+2.1 EPA points). Meanwhile, San Francisco's injuries—especially to Trent Williams (who's truly questionable), Nick Bosa, and Fred Warner—push things even more in Philly's favor, despite the 49ers' impressive 49.7% third-down conversion rate and their historic special teams EPA (+7.1 per game). Even if Williams manages to suit up, will he be close to 100%? Hamstring injuries are tricky and there's always the risk of a mid-game setback.Don't forget about Ricky Pearsall, either. He's a legit downfield threat, but he's been dealing with a knee injury. I expect he'll play, but how effective will he really be? Those are big questions hanging over the 49ers' offense. This feels like the game where all those injuries finally catch up with the 49ers—a team that impressively managed 12 wins despite being banged up most of the season. The Eagles secured the NFC East and had the luxury of managing reps down the stretch. Key offensive pieces like A.J. Brown and Saquon Barkley are healthy and ready for a heavy workload.Here's a stat that really stands out: San Francisco ranks dead last in quarterback sacks (just 1.2 per game) and sits at a -0.4 sack differential. Meanwhile, the Eagles generate 2.5 sacks per game and boast a +0.4 sack differential. That disparity could be a game-changer in a matchup like this. Hurts and the Eagles' offense should have ample time to pick apart a 49ers pass defense that ranks 27th in opponent passer rating (100.5). The Eagles show no signs of slowing down and look poised for another Super Bowl run.Los Angeles Chargers over New England Patriots\nNew England benefited from one of the NFL's softest schedules and posted a 3–2 record against playoff teams. Since Week 12, the Patriots' run defense has dropped to 30th in EPA per play. Jim Harbaugh and Greg Roman are masters at crafting a productive run game, even with injuries up front. Meanwhile, the Chargers lead the league in opponent passer rating while New England sits at 21st. Since 2002, first-time playoff QBs (Drake Maye) have won only 35.4% of their games. Justin Herbert's postseason experience and elite processing give the Chargers a clear advantage. The Ravens recently played the Patriots—look for Harbaugh to pick up valuable tips from his brother. Most of the bets—and the money—are coming in on the home team. The average fan sees the Patriots' win-loss record and figures they're a lock. But it's never that simple.The Patriots' defense inside the red zone has been a disaster all year. They're 30th in the NFL—basically, if you get inside their 20, you're almost guaranteed to score a touchdown. That's the last thing you want heading into the postseason. The Chargers are on the other end of the spectrum: fourth in the league in red-zone defense, and they get even stingier when the field shrinks. These are the little things that can make or break a playoff run. And with the Patriots having played the league's softest schedule, you have to wonder if they're really prepared for playoff-caliber competition.Jesse Minter has the Chargers' defense dialed in. His guys play smart, stay disciplined and simply don't give up easy yards. Minter's quarters-based zone isn't flashy, but it's effective. Quarterbacks who like to throw deep usually end up frustrated. Maye is in for a real challenge in his first playoff start as this Chargers defense doesn't make anything easy. If Minter ends up as a head coach next season, it won't be a surprise. He's been quietly excellent all season and people around the league are starting to notice. I love the Chargers on the spread and money line.Pittsburgh Steelers over Houston Texans\nAlthough the Texans enter this matchup with a superior 12-5 record and a high-flying defense, the Steelers are primed to pull off the upset on Monday night. While the oddsmakers might favor C.J. Stroud and the Texans, the specific conditions of this game—venue, quarterback experience, and defensive style—tilt the advantage toward the black and gold.With all the retirement rumors swirling, Aaron Rodgers is playing like a guy with nothing left to prove—loose, confident, and completely in the moment. Playoff games come down to the details: nailing third downs, making smart choices in the red zone, and not blinking when the pressure's on. That's where Rodgers' experience makes a difference. He's been around forever and there's nothing a defense can throw at him that he hasn't already seen.On the other side, Stroud is a rising star, but this is a tough spot. He's about to get a heavy dose of Teryl Austin's defense, which specializes in confusing young quarterbacks with all sorts of looks and pressure. Add in the confidence Pittsburgh brings after beating the Ravens—and the fact the Steelers don't have to deal with Baltimore's relentless run game—and they are in a great position to make things messy for Houston.The Texans are built for speed and thrive in the controlled environment of NRG Stadium. In Pittsburgh, the forecast likely calls for freezing temperatures and potential precipitation. This slows down the Texans' fast-track receivers and neutralizes their athletic edge. The \"Renegade\" effect is real. In a primetime night game, the Acrisure home crowd disrupts communication, which is vital for the Texans' timing-based offense.Pittsburgh's singular statistical advantage is devastating efficiency in the red zone: 58.8% touchdown conversion (11th) compared to Houston's abysmal 46.3% (30th). This 12.5% gap means when Pittsburgh gets scoring opportunities inside the 20-yard line, it finishes drives far more effectively than Houston. In a low-scoring playoff game, this could be the difference that decides who moves on.The Texans might have more speed and flash, but the Steelers bring the grit. In a cold weather playoff battle, give me the team that knows how to win ugly. I think this one comes down to grit and experience. Rodgers makes a clutch throw in crunch time, T.J. Watt forces a game-changing strip-sack in the fourth and the Steelers gut out a 20-17 win over Houston.\n            ",

Taylor-Britt was driving recklessly following a Bengals game while pedestrians were still in the area, according to a Cincinnati police officer. Taylor-Britt, who was booked at 11 a.m., appeared in court on crutches as he continues to recover from a season-ending Lisfranc injury that was sustained during the Bengals' Week 11 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers. \nTaylor-Britt, 26, was the 60th overall pick in the 2022 NFL Draft. He cracked Cincinnati's starting lineup as a rookie and helped the Bengals advance to the AFC title game that season. He then had a career-high four interceptions in 2023 and had three interceptions that following season while being a central part of the Bengals' defense. \nThis season was a setback for Taylor-Britt, however. He lost his job this season under new defensive coordinator Al Golden. He made two starts in eight games before sustaining his season-ending injury. Taylor-Britt addressed his upcoming free agency a day prior to his sentencing. He said that while he would welcome a return to Cincinnati, he wouldn't mind a change of scenery, either. \n\"I accept everything that's happened,\" Taylor-Britt said of his time in Cincinnati. \"I think everything played out the way it's supposed to. I'm very grateful for everything that happened. The ups and the downs built character and the man I am today.\" \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Miami and Ole Miss are chasing history in the College Football Playoff. Ole Miss has already broken the school record with 13 wins, and is closer than ever before to winning the school's first solo national title. Miami has bucked expectations, sneaking into the playoff and navigating the most difficult postseason path to reach the semifinals.It's the ACC vs. SEC, a high-flying offense against a big-time defense. It's The U against The New. No matter who wins, the victor will land in the national championship as an unlikely participant. Simply put, No. 10 Miami vs. No. 6 Ole Miss doesn't get much better in terms of stakes and storylines. The Rebels could win a national title without Lane Kiffin, who bolted town for rival LSU -- and grabbed a few Ole Miss assistants -- before the playoff. Miami can cap its long-gestating return to glory under alum Mario Cristobal, who left Oregon three years ago to lift his alma mater back on the national stage.Neither team is short on superstars. Quarterback Carson Beck is the most accurate passer remaining in the playoffs. Ole Miss' Trinidad Chambliss went from a Division II national champion to a backup on the Rebels' bench to perhaps the most electric player in the postseason. Georgia couldn't keep up with him in the quarterfinals as he led the Rebels to a thrilling, 39-34 comeback victory. \nMiami's defense has been a brick wall, allowing only 17 total points in wins against Texas A&M and Ohio State in the CFP. They sacked mobile quarterback Marcel Reed seven times on the road. Julian Sayin, the nation's most accurate passer, couldn't pick up first downs.The Fiesta Bowl pits two of the most fascinating stories in the CFP.Miami vs. Ole Miss: Need to know for Fiesta BowlTrench warfare: Miami's postseason run has been highlighted by the incredible pass rush provided by Rueben Bain Jr. and Akheem Mesidor, who have helped lead the nation's best sack-producing defense. The Hurricanes have 12 sacks in two playoff games and have recorded at least four sacks in four straight games, pushing their total to 46 for the season. Their pressure rate is also an elite 40.5%. Ole Miss only allows 1.3 sacks per game, ranking in the top 20 nationally, and actually ranks behind Ohio State, which gave up six sacks to Miami. Still, the difference for the Rebels is quarterback Trinidad Chambliss, whose mobility kept Georgia out of reach. The Bulldogs had zero sacks and only three tackles for loss in the quarterfinals. Ole Miss is sacked on only 3.1% of pass plays, ranking seventh nationally. Championship pedigrees: Ole Miss has never won a solo national title, and Miami is chasing its first since 2001, but championship-worthy quarterbacks lead both teams in their pursuit of history. Chambliss led Ferris State to a Division II national title last season before transferring to Ole Miss. Carson Beck is 36-5 in his career, including a 15-3 record against ranked opponents. He's the first quarterback to win that many games over three years since 2012-14 (Marcus Mariota). Beck has completed 74.4% of his passes, but in the last two games, he's thrown for fewer than 150 yards for the first time in his career as a starter. Chambliss has thrown for 300-plus yards in eight games this season, including a career high in the win last week against Georgia.\nWhich elite running back steps up?: Get ready for a run-off in Arizona. Miami's Mark Fletcher Jr. has been a bull in the playoffs, especially late in games, rushing for 262 yards in the postseason to rank fourth all-time in CFP history. Ole Miss' Kewan Lacy is a scoring machine, recording rushing touchdowns in the last eight games while picking up an incredible 877 yards over that span. Lacy's 23 rushing touchdowns rank third in SEC history, behind two Alabama running backs who won national titles in their respective seasons.Where to watch Miami vs. Ole Miss liveDate: Thursday, Jan. 8 | Time: 7:30 p.m. ETLocation: State Farm Stadium -- Glendale, ArizonaTV: ESPN | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)Miami vs. Ole Miss prediction, picks\nIf Miami struggles to affect Trinidad Chambliss in the pocket, the Rebels win. If the Rebels can't protect their quarterback against defensive ends Rueben Bain Jr. and Akheem Mesidor, the Hurricanes win. Chambliss has escaped pressure most of the season, but so had Texas A&M's Marcel Reed before Miami sacked him seven times in the first round. Ole Miss' defense is solid but not elite, which should allow the Hurricanes to score at least three touchdowns with a multitude of stars who have been kept at bay against two elite defenses in the CFP. Ole Miss has scored 30-plus in eight straight games.  Pick: Over 51.5\n\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n

    "body": "\n        Pittsburgh Steelers fans are turning Tyler Loop's missed field goal into a positive for the Baltimore Ravens' rookie kicker. Following Loop's missed field goal that sealed Pittsburgh's Week 18 win over Baltimore, Steelers fans have been making donations in his name to the John S. Mulholland Family Foundation, which provides for food-insecure, working poor families in the District of Columbia. Many fans have been donating $26.24, a reference to the final score. According to DKPittsburghSports, the foundation has shared that they have \"been receiving a flurry of donations this morning in honor of Tyler Loop, the Baltimore Ravens kicker who missed the game-winning field goal last night. Honestly don't know him and didn't know of his support for us, and they are largely from Steelers fans, but I was touched by the sentiment of 'turning a bad situation into something positive.' And I do know he's a young man of great faith -- nice gesture, wherever it came from!\"Loop, a sixth-round pick in last year's draft, had made a 40-yard field goal earlier in the game and had made each of his three point-after attempts prior to missing a 44-yard field goal attempt as time expired. With the win, the Steelers clinched the AFC North division and the playoff spot that came with it. Conversely, the Ravens' season came to an end as Baltimore missed the playoffs for the first time since 2021. \n\"I want to do better,\" Loop said afterward. \"Unfortunately, the nature of the job is you have makes -- and those are awesome -- and then unfortunately you have misses. For that to happen tonight sucks. We've been through a lot of adversity this year as a team early on. We fought, we fought and we fought and worked really hard together. Those guys have had my back, and I want to try my best to have theirs.\"It's disappointing and it sucks, but also the nature of the job is I gotta move on and I gotta get ready for the next kick. That's next year. Tomorrow starts training for that.\"\nThis marks the second straight year where an opposing fan base has rallied around a Ravens player following a season-ending loss. Last January, Bills fans donated to tight end Mark Andrews' charity after Andrews dropped a pass that would have tied the score late in Baltimore's eventual 27-25 loss to Buffalo in the divisional round of the playoffs. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Recent logic in football says running backs aren't worth overpaying. But an older adage still applies: value is whatever someone will pay. Enter Jadan Baugh, the star Florida running back who announced his return to the Gators on Tuesday morning via social media. Multiple sources indicate Baugh will receive at least $1 million for his services in Gainesville, a further indication that the running back market has exploded across college football. In 2024, CBS Sports did analysis of the market at each position with the range for running backs between $200,000-$300,000. At the time, Ohio State's Quinshon Judkins was on the high end making, according to a source, around $650,000. Now the high end is into the seven figures at the position. \"Who are the agents telling kids that a reasonable ask? Surely it can't be anyone with a frontal lobe?\" One industry source responded to the seven-figure ceiling number. \nOne Big Ten general manager told CBS Sports: \"The running back numbers have been absolutely stupid. They don't make any sense.\"While the average, according to industry sources, is $400,000 to $700,000 at the position this year, that signals that the price has risen in the revenue sharing era overall. Kewan Lacy decided Tuesday to stay with Ole Miss rather than follow Lane Kiffin to LSU and his price point will be significantly higher than Baugh's, an indicator of the even more desperate battle the Rebels and Kiffin are up to. It may strike fans as odd as the emphasis on running backs has been lessened at the professional level, but college football operates a little differently with a running back having more of an outsized impact on an offense's success, and there's no worry about the spectre of a player turning 30 and falling off a cliff production wise. If Baugh were to enter the portal, it is expected he would be one of, if not the highest ranked player at the position in the 247Sports transfer portal rankings and likely a top 10 player overall, according to transfer portal analyst Cooper Petagna. \nThe stakes are high around Baugh, who rushed for 1,170 yards last season. There is a level of legitimacy within the fanbase that retaining Baugh gives new coach Jon Sumrall, who is under scrutiny because he is the second Group of Five coach at Florida, right or wrong. And there is an implicit level of seriousness involved with the concept of stepping up to pay a star player. Baugh is a symbol of that for Florida in 2026, and Sumrall and his staff know that well. Baugh was the SEC's third-leading rusher last year, and the lasting memory Florida fans have of him is running for a rivalry game record 266 yards against Florida State at home to end the season. Florida fans also remember in 2023, when promising running back Trevor Etienne left in the portal to go to their other hated rival, Georgia. The Dawgs weren't the Gators key challenger for Baugh's services, though. That title belonged to running back-hungry Texas.\nFor the Longhorns and specifically new running backs coach Jabbar Juluke, Baugh was a high priority in what is likely the Longhorns' final season with Arch Manning. Texashas serious aspirations at the school's first national championship in 20 years. Four Texas running backs are in the portal, including three of its top-four backs in terms of carries. It was an industry assumption when Juluke came over from Florida that Baugh would be following as the post-Billy Napier exits piled up. Texas wants multiple running backs in the portal and has contingency plans after missing out on Baugh, but none will be as good (or, albeit, as expensive). What the market around Baugh indicates is that the market for player compensation continues to mature rapidly. The sticker shock exists, but it's the price of doing business in today's college football. \n            ",

That's right, it's not even the Super Bowl yet, but we're already getting ready for the next Fantasy campaign.  With that in mind, here is the first look at our early 2026 running back rankings. We're well aware that a lot could change with free agency and the NFL Draft.  But based on what just happened with the 2025 season, as well as what we think could happen this offseason, here are the top 12 running back rankings for 2026 from members of our CBS Sports staff. Jamey Eisenberg1. Bijan Robinson 2. Jahmyr Gibbs 3. De'Von Achane 4. Christian McCaffrey 5. Jonathan Taylor 6. James Cook 7. Omarion Hampton 8. Chase Brown 9. Josh Jacobs 10. Ashton Jeanty 11. Derrick Henry 12. Saquon Barkley What stood out: Henry just turned 32, and we don't know what's going to happen with the Ravens this offseason. But at 31, he just averaged 15.7 PPR points per game, was second in the NFL with 16 rushing touchdowns, and second in rushing yards with 1,595. It wasn't pretty at times how he got his numbers, but he still managed seven games with at least 17.4 PPR points. And in the Fantasy playoffs in the majority of leagues (Weeks 15-17), Henry scored at least 22.8 PPR points twice. I can understand being skeptical of Henry at his age, and at some point, Father Time will come calling. But I'm still willing to draft Henry in Round 2 if he decides to keep playing in 2026.Adam Aizer1. Bijan Robinson 2. Jahmyr Gibbs 3. De'Von Achane 4. Omarion Hampton 5. Christian McCaffrey 6. James Cook 7. Jonathan Taylor 8. Josh Jacobs 9. Chase Brown 10. Saquon Barkley 11. RJ Harvey 12. Ashton Jeanty  What stood out: Adam is the highest on two rookies in Hampton and Harvey, and there's a lot to love about their upside. We all have Hampton ranked in the top 12, and he was great when healthy in 2025. He missed seven games with a foot injury and then rested in Week 18 to get ready for the NFL playoffs, but in nine healthy games, he scored at least 14.7 PPR points five times. He also had four games with at least five receptions, and the Chargers offensive line will hopefully be healthy in 2026 after being ravaged by injuries. Hampton might be a Round 1 pick next season. For Harvey, he came on strong late in the season after J.K. Dobbins (foot) was injured in Week 10. Harvey scored at least 18.6 PPR points in four of his final six games, including six total touchdowns and three outings with at least four receptions over that span. I expect the Broncos to use multiple running backs in 2026, so we'll see who complements Harvey next season. That said, he's someone to target as early as Round 2 as of now.  Heath Cummings1. Jahmyr Gibbs 2. Bijan Robinson 3. Christian McCaffrey 4. De'Von Achane 5. Jonathan Taylor 6. James Cook 7. Josh Jacobs 8. Ashton Jeanty 9. Chase Brown 10. Travis Etienne 11. Omarion Hampton 12. Saquon Barkley  What stood out: Heath is the only one who ranked Etienne in his top 12, and I'm curious what's going to happen with him this offseason since he's a potential free agent. The Jaguars could re-sign him or give him the franchise tag, and ideally, he stays in Jacksonville to build on his performance from 2025. Etienne had a standout season with 260 carries for 1,107 yards and seven touchdowns, along with 36 catches for 292 yards and six touchdowns on 52 targets. He averaged 14.7 PPR points per game, and Liam Coen's offense revived Etienne's career after a dismal 2024, when he averaged 8.7 PPR points per game. Depending on what happens this offseason, Etienne could be a solid Round 2 selection in the majority of leagues, and then we might join Heath in ranking Etienne in the top 12. \nJacob Gibbs1. Jahmyr Gibbs 2. Christian McCaffrey 3. Bijan Robinson 4. De'Von Achane 5. Jonathan Taylor 6. James Cook 7. TreVeyon Henderson 8. Josh Jacobs 9. Ashton Jeanty 10. Omarion Hampton 11. Cam Skattebo 12. Chase Brown  What stood out: Jacob is the only one who ranked Skattebo in his top 12, and I hope he's healthy for the start of 2026 after the ankle injury he suffered in Week 8 of his rookie campaign. Prior to getting hurt, Skattebo was a Fantasy star, and he averaged 15.9 PPR points per game, which led all rookies. In the six games where he had double digits in carries, Skattebo averaged 19.1 PPR points, and he scored seven total touchdowns and had 24 catches for 207 yards on 32 targets. We'll see who the Giants hire at coach, and hopefully there's not an even split in touches for Skattebo and Tyrone Tracy Jr. But given what Skattebo showed in a small sample size in 2025, there's a lot to love about his upside, and hopefully he'll be ready to go for Week 1 in 2026. Dave Richard1. Jahmyr Gibbs   2. Bijan Robinson 3. De'Von Achane 4. Christian McCaffrey 5. James Cook 6. Jonathan Taylor 7. Omarion Hampton 8. Chase Brown 9. Ashton Jeanty 10. TreVeyon Henderson 11. Josh Jacobs 12. Saquon Barkley  What stood out: Dave and Jacob were the only ones who have Henderson ranked in the top 12, and I'm curious to see where Fantasy managers will draft him in 2026. As of now, I would guess Round 3 at the earliest. He was amazing at times in his rookie campaign in 2025 with four games of at least 17.3 PPR points, but two of them came when Rhamondre Stevenson was out. In 14 games with Stevenson, Henderson averaged just 9.5 PPR points per game, and Stevenson is under contract through 2028. I love Henderson's upside as much as anyone, but he only played more snaps than Stevenson three times. It seems like we're headed for a tandem again in 2026, which is why Henderson is not in my top 12 as of now.\nDan Schneier1. Christian McCaffrey  2. Bijan Robinson 3. Jahmyr Gibbs 4. Jonathan Taylor 5. De'Von Achane 6. James Cook 7. Chase Brown 8. Ashton Jeanty 9. Derrick Henry 10. Saquon Barkley 11. Josh Jacobs 12. Omarion Hampton  What stood out: We all have McCaffrey ranked in the top five, but Dan is the only one who has him at No. 1. And when to draft McCaffrey is going to be one of the biggest talking points all offseason for Fantasy managers. McCaffrey was once again amazing in 2025 when he finished No. 1 among non-quarterbacks at 23.8 PPR points per game. He ended the regular season with 311 carries for 1,202 yards and 10 touchdowns, and 102 catches for 924 yards and seven touchdowns on 129 targets. But he turns 30 in June and just had over 400 total touches in 2025, which are major red flags. The last time he played a full season with a hefty workload was in 2023, and he came back the following year and was limited to four games due to injury -- and now the risk is amplified with his age. As of now, I'll still draft McCaffrey in Round 1, but I won't have him ahead of Robinson, Gibbs, or Achane.\n            \n    \n\n        \n\n    \n            \n    \n            \n\n

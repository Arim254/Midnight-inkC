    "body": "\n        Team Canada star center Sidney Crosby exited his team's Olympic quarterfinal win over Czechia on Wednesday with a lower-body injury. Crosby, who will undergo imagining in Milan to determine the severity of his injury, left the contest in the second period after absorbing an awkward hit from two Czech players, and he was ruled out for the third.Over the course of a single shift midway through the second period, Crosby took a stiff shot from Czechia defenseman Radko Gudas in the neutral zone and got crunched between Gudas and Martin Necas along the boards. The second hit appeared to be the one that injured Crosby as he labored getting off the ice before immediately seeking assistance from medical staff on the bench.\nThe Canadian trainer examined Crosby on the end of the bench for a few moments before accompanying him to the locker room. Crosby displayed a noticeable limp down the tunnel.Canadian coach Jon Cooper said the team used Crosby's injury as a rallying cry heading into the third period. Canada notched a dramatic 4-3 overtime win, which included a comeback late in regulation.\nEntering the game on Wednesday, Crosby was tied for second on the Canadian team in points with six. Fortunately for Canada, the team's center depth is still exceptional with the one-two punch of Connor McDavid and Nathan MacKinnon as the headliners down the middle.What could this mean for Team Canada?On top of the implications for Team Canada, this could be a significant development for Crosby's career. Now 38 years old, Crosby would be 42 in 2030, which means this may have been his last opportunity to play on the Olympic stage. Crosby already has his iconic Olympic moment -- the \"Golden Goal\" in 2010 -- but he was looking for one final run in 2026.Losing Crosby for the rest of the tournament, while not devastating, would be a tough blow for the Canadians. Although Canada would still boast the most talented roster in Italy, Crosby remains among the best players in the world, and he is one of just two members of the team (along with Drew Doughty) with Olympic experience.\nCrosby's potential absence doesn't crater Canada's gold medal chances after surviving an overtime scare from Czechia in Wednesday's quarterfinals. Crosby is still an elite two-way player, he gave Canada absurd center depth and he is the rare NHL player with prior Olympic experience. All that said, the Canadians are still the favorites to win this tournament. Connor McDavid and Nathan MacKinnon -- perhaps the two best players in the world -- give the team a knockout out-two punch at center. If Crosby does miss the last game or two, Canada would replace him with Sam Bennett, a two-time Stanley Cup champion and the reigning Conn Smythe Trophy winner. That's the definition of elite depth.What could this mean for the Penguins?In addition to the entire nation of Canada, the city of Pittsburgh will be holding its breath as everyone awaits a more definitive update on Crosby. The heart and soul of the Penguins franchise since his rookie season in 2005-06, Crosby has the team in the thick of the playoff race this season.\nOne of the NHL's biggest surprises, the Penguins are 29-15-12 and sit in second place in the Metro Division, thanks in large part to the efforts of Crosby. He leads the team in goals (27), assists (32) and points (59). When it comes to goals and points, no one else on the team is particularly close. Crosby is the straw stirring the drink in Pittsburgh.If Crosby is forced to miss significant time, the Penguins would go from Stanley Cup dark horse to first-round cannon fodder, assuming they didn't drop out of the playoff picture altogether. A long-term injury to Crosby would also force general manager Kyle Dubas to make some split decisions at the March 6 trade deadline. If Crosby is sidelined, might Pittsburgh choose to sell?What could this mean for future Olympics?The return of the NHL to the Winter Olympics has been such a joy to watch, but as we saw on Wednesday, the risk of star players being injured is ever present. Los Angeles Kings star Kevin Fiala already suffered a season-ending injury playing for Swizterland, and now Crosby was hurt wearing a Canadian sweater. \nNHL players already had to fight for their right to make an Olympic return in the latest CBA negotiations. The current CBA is set to expire in September of this year, but a new deal that has already been agreed upon will kick in and runs through the 2029-30 season. That deal also includes Olympic participation, but could we see more pushback from the owners starting in 2034? When a superstar like Crosby goes down in a game with no bearing on the NHL standings, there are ripple effects throughout the league.\n            ",

Hughes sealed a 2-1 win over Sweden on Wednesday, and the Americans are through to the medal round to face Slovakia in the semifinals.The Americans held a 1-0 lead for much of the contest, but a late goal by Sweden's Mika Zibanejad tied the game with just 1:31 left in regulation. The game went into a 10-minute three-on-three period, and the Americans regrouped to control overtime and pull out the win.On the game-winning goal, Hughes used his elite skating and stick-handling to create just enough space for a powerful wrist shot that beat Swedish goalie Jacob Markstrom.\nDylan Larkin, who his best game of the tournament, scored the other goal for the Americans as he turned in his best performance of these Olympics. Larkin was also key in disrupting Sweden's only power play of the game, which came in the third period. Connor Hellebuyck was nearly perfect in goal as he turned away 28 of the 29 Swedish shots that came his way. It was a little too close for comfort, but Team USA will face Slovakia on Friday. The Slovakians, led by Montreal Canadiens star Juraj Slafkovsky, have been on a magical run thus far. Puck drop for that matchup is set for 3:10 p.m. ET.Since NHL players first went to the Olympics in 1998, the Americans have never medaled outside of North America.

The Crimson Tide have won five straight against Arkansas, and haven't lost on their home floor to Arkansas since 2019. Sophomore guard Labaron Philon Jr. is 13th in the nation in scoring at 21.3 points per game, with junior guard Aden Holloway adding 17 ppg this season. Meanwhile, Arkansas is 0-2 on the road against ranked teams this season. The model projects Alabama to cover in 65% of simulations. Back Alabama to cover at DraftKings here:BYU (+11.5) vs. Arizona (-110)Arizona has dropped back-to-back games, falling from No. 1 to No. 4 in the nation in the most recent polls. Arizona defeated BYU, 86-63, on the road on Jan. 26, which began a four-game losing streak for the Cougars. But BYU has rebounded with back-to-back wins. Both teams feature star freshmen in this matchup, but BYU has the projected top prospect between the two teams in AJ Dybantsa, who could be the No. 1 pick in the 2026 NBA Draft. Dybantsa leads the nation at 24.4 ppg, including scoring at least 28 points in three of his last four games. Despite shooting just 25% from the field in their first matchup, Dybantsa had 24 points against Arizona last time, and the model expects a more efficient performance from the star freshman and views 11.5 points as simply too high given how competitive their first meeting was. Arizona star freshman forward Koa Peat (leg) is out. The model projects BYU to cover in 67% of simulations. Back BYU to cover at DraftKings here:St. John's (-9.5) vs. Marquette\"St. John's holds several key advantages, including experience, but rebounding is the true difference-maker,\" SportsLine expert Jeff Hochman said. \"Rick Pitino's squad ranks among the nation's elite in offensive rebounding, recovering over 37% of their missed shots. Marquette sits near the bottom of the Big East in defensive rebounding—a recurring weakness. In their last matchup just a month ago, St. John's dominated the glass and turned that hustle into a commanding 92–68 victory, fueled by a huge advantage in second-chance points. On average, St. John's is statistically more likely to recover its own misses than Marquette is to secure the rebound. This edge can generate 12–15 additional scoring chances per game, equating to 14–18 points—enough to swing the outcome and cover this spread again.\" Back St. John's to cover at DraftKings here:\nWant more college basketball picks on Wednesday?You've seen some of the model's Wednesday best bets.

Thomas announced on Instagram -- with the help of country music star Luke Bryan -- that he would play the event, posting, \"See you Monday.\" Shelved since November 2025, when he underwent a microdiscectomy to repair a back issue, Thomas was cleared to return to full golf activities last week. Testing the waters in TGL before making his PGA Tour debut makes sense, as the simulator golf league will be a comfortable way to ease back into competitive golf and see how his body responds to making some swings without having to worry about walking a full 18 holes.Thomas is coming off a resurgent 2025 season in which he won for the first time since 2022 at the RBC Heritage and returned to a top 10 spot in the world ranking. He's dropped to No. 14 while inactive since the start of the 2026 season but hopes fixing his back issues will allow him to quickly return to the form he showed last year. If all goes according to plan, Thomas is eyeing a return at some point during the Florida Swing, as he shared in a post last month. \n\"Recovery has gone well,\" Thomas posted in January. \"I'm slowly building back my strength and conditioning in the gym, and also hitting wedges/short irons. Little victories and patience have been the biggest part of the process. Taking it slow and listening to how I'm feeling each day! I'm looking to come back competitively at some point during the Florida Swing. I know how important it is to get this injury behind me so that I'm only looking forward over the course of the season.\"The PGA Tour's trek through the Sunshine State begins next week at the Cognizant Classic. It is followed by a signature event at the Arnold Palmer Invitational and the PGA Tour's flagship event, The Players Championship, in three weeks. \nPlaying in TGL will allow Thomas to evaluate his body and his game before testing both against the best players in the world outdoors. If he performs well at the SoFi Center on Monday and his body responds accordingly, Thomas may be back in action on the PGA Tour in early March.\n            \n",

The unverified screenshots that circulated on social media ahead of the NBA All-Star Game last weekend featured direct messages discussing a variety of topics, including Devin Booker, Durant's former teammate with the Phoenix Suns, and his former coach, Frank Vogel. The messages also included commentary about the Golden State Warriors and complaints about Rockets forward Jabari Smith Jr. and big man Alperen Şengün. Durant was asked if the person behind the account was him, but he declined to give a direct answer.\"I'm not here to get into Twitter nonsense,\" Durant said. \"I'm just here to focus on the season. Keep it pushing. I get y'all have to ask those questions.\"In a follow-up question asking if he had discussed the allegations with his teammates on the Rockets, Durant once again declined to give a yes or no answer.\n\"My teammates know what it is,\" Durant said. \"We have been locked in the whole season. We enjoyed our break. Had a great practice today. Looking forward to the road trip.\"\nDurant, who is very active on all social media platforms -- including X -- has previously admitted to using a burner account. Back in 2017, Durant sent several tweets in a third-person voice from his personal X account with nearly 20 million followers explaining his decision to leave the Thunder for the Golden State Warriors while blaming the Oklahoma City organization and then-coach Billy Donovan.\nDays after the incident, Durant apologized and said he was \"disappointed\" in himself for the way he was \"acting so childish.\"\nDurant, who was traded from Phoenix to Houston last offseason, is averaging 25.8 points, 5.3 rebounds and 4.4 assists in his first season with his team. The Rockets are the fifth franchise Durant has played for during his 18-year NBA career.\n            \n",

    "body": "\n        As one of the most exciting, dynamic and often enigmatic superstars in the sport of boxing, Ryan Garcia typically walks to the beat of his own drum, which can often create opportunities that others don't receive. Take for instance the fact that Garcia (24-2, 20 KOs), who has never won a scheduled fight at 147 pounds and is fresh off of a lifeless defeat to WBA welterweight titleholder Rolando Romero last May, will challenge for Mario Barrios' WBC title on Saturday when the two meet in a headlining fight (DAZN PPV, 7:55 p.m. ET) inside T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. Garcia, 27, isn't just entering the fight against Barrios (29-2-2, 18 KOs) following a loss, he's also not that far removed from serving a one-year suspension for a failed a drug test following his 2024 win over Devin Haney (that later became a no contest), which led to his life publicly spiraling out of control amid drug use, a mental health episode and a series of racist rants on social media. One thing Garcia, besides his massive following on social media that features nearly 13 million followers on Instagram alone, has going for him is that when he's mentally present and prepared to fight, he has an almost electrifying combination of power and speed that is a potential problem for any elite foe. \n\"When I'm at the top of my game,\" Garcia told CBS Sports on Tuesday, \"I don't think anyone can really mess with me.\"The hardest part for anyone, from Garcia's fans and critics to Barrios, himself, is trying to figure out which version of \"King Ryan\" is going to walk through that door considering how many big moments in his career (when he got up off the canvas to knock out Luke Campbell in 2021) were immediately followed by low points (when he sat idle for more than a year battling mental health). Ryan Garcia's last five fightsOpponentDateResultRolando RomeroMay 2, 2025Unanimous decision lossDevin HaneyApril 20, 2024Unanimous decision win, later overturned to No Contest for failed drug testOscar DuarteDec. 2, 2023Eighth-round knockout winGervonta DavisApril 22, 2023Seventh-round knockout lossJavier FortunaJuly 16, 2022Sixth-round knockout winFor the record, Garcia believes there are justifiable reasons behind his poor performance against Romero (quickly referencing potential dark energy within the venue), he's just not willing to expand on them. And if his recent interviews are any indication, Garcia's behavior has seemingly alternated on the day between being a calm presence and a much more manic one, which only fuels his unpredictability, mostly because of how often he attempts mental warfare on his opponents.\"Most people don't know shit about boxing and I know a lot of people don't know anything about me,\" Garcia said. \"There are reasons why and I could explain them for the last performance I had but I'm not going to go into that. I feel like on Saturday, you are going to see something special from me. You are going to see a Ryan Garcia classic. That's it.\"Barrios, a 30-year-old native of San Antonio, enters as a firm betting underdog following his own string of uneven performances. For as great as he looked in retiring Yordenis Ugas in 2023 to claim the WBC interim title, both of his full title defenses have ended in frustrating draws, including against a 46-year-old Manny Pacquiao last July. But even Barrios has had a difficult time trying to identify what to expect from Garcia.\"It's hard to say, really, where exactly he is at,\" Barrios told CBS Sports last week. \"I just have to prepare as if I have a focused Ryan in front of me, as they are saying. Everything else is kind of just background noise. We have to look at Ryan when he has been at his best and has looked extraordinary and just picture and imagine that is who we will be facing. Whatever version shows up, if it's any less, that's going to be for him to answer.\"I just feel like when Ryan faces adversity, he doesn't make the necessary adjustments and with this fight, I'm looking to go in there and exploit all of his weaknesses. I want to make him uncomfortable, I want to test his heart and test how bad he really wants to be in there.\"\nGarcia is well aware both of those who believe he doesn't deserve the title fight and those who question whether he can ever look as good again as he did in dropping Haney three times under the cloud of testing positive for ostarine. Forever the troll, however, Garcia's demeanor transformed from quiet confidence to theatrical disruptor when asked what the impact of a potential comeback stoppage win for him over Barrios would have on the boxing community at large.\"'Oh no, he's back! Oh no, he's really becoming what we didn't want him to become, the face of boxing. Oh no!'\" Garcia said while mimicking his critics. \"They are going to be real sad, the haters. But I'm just happy because I think I'm at a time in my life where I'm positioned to really represent what it means to be a champion and I can't wait to have that strap around my waist and hold it proudly and fight people that people expect me to fight and be a great champion.\"True to his nature of always seeking big fights (which includes a 2023 loss to Gervonta Davis that produced more than 1 million PPV buys), Garcia already has a target lined up next in his sights in the form of Shakur Stevenson, should he defeat Barrios. The 28-year-old Stevenson (25-0, 11 KOs) is just shy of three weeks removed from winning a title in a fourth weight division by widely outpoint Teofimo Lopez to capture the WBO belt at 140 pounds. Garcia was anything but impressed by Stevenson's performance and is confident that the two can meet next at a catchweight of 144 pounds (without the rehydration clause Davis used on Garcia). \n\"[Stevenson] controlled range really well and picked his shots. We give him credit for that but there was really nothing special for me that really catches my eye,\" Garcia said. \"He didn't really throw his left hand, he didn't finish [Lopez] off. You had a hurt little animal there that you could've just [finished] anytime you wanted but he played it safe every step of the way. That's just not how I fight. When I am beating someone up and they are pretty much done, you are going to see me take them out. \"That's just that simple but I've got that killer instinct. I guess you just have it or you don't and [Shakur] doesn't have it. So, when we step into that ring, he will feel the difference. That's who I want, for sure, sooner rather than later.\"Garcia, who will be cornered by his father Henry, has used the fallout of former trainer Joe Goossen joining forces for this fight with Barrios as an opportunity, including at the introductory press conference, to stir the pot and attempt to get inside Barrios' head. But separate from those type of theatrics, all signs have pointed to Garcia taking the fight very seriously because of how much he realizes a consecutive defeat would hurt his future options. \nNot only does Garcia believe he's the better fighter, he thinks the many wars Barrios has taken part in have slowly caught up with him. But regardless of the potential resistance applied by Barrios, Garcia has very much deemed this as a \"do or die moment\" for his career.    \"This is one of those moments or opportunities that I don't think I can get again, especially coming off of a loss. I feel like my back is against the wall, Garcia said. \"I'm just that guy. I'm just him. I don't think I'm a good guy or a bad guy, I think I'm just me. I'm competitive and I really want to win this bad, really bad. You are going to see a ferocious animal in the ring on Saturday night.\"\n            ",

The Americans have outscored opponents 31-1, and they've posted shutouts in five straight games. Team USA has hardly broken a sweat, but the history of its rivalry with Canada suggests that may change in the final.There have been seven Olympics featuring women's ice hockey, and the gold medal game has featured U.S. vs. Canada six times. The Canadians are 4-2 in those games with four of them ending in a 3-2 score -- and two of those went into overtime. There is rarely much room between these two teams, although the Americans did hand the Canadians a 5-0 loss in the preliminary round.Team USA has simply been operating on a different level than everyone else in Italy. That starts with defender Caroline Harvey, who leads the tournament with nine points. First-time Olympian Laila Edwards has burst onto the scene with seven points as she ascends toward stardom, and Abbey Murphy seems to be at the center of every big play.The gold medal game will also be the last Olympic appearance for captain Hilary Knight, who is seeking her fifth Olympic medal and second gold. Knight is also one goal and one point away from breaking a pair of all-time U.S. women's hockey Olympic records.Can Team USA finish off one of the most dominant runs in Olympic history?

    "body": "\n        Arsenal have lost their heads. There is no other rational explanation for how the Premier League leaders, for now at least, could blow a two-goal lead against a side who will cherish this 2-2 draw because it makes it that much less likely they will go down in history as statistically the worst team in this competition's history.Three years of second-placed finishes has led to a familiar refrain around Arsenal, that they are bottlers, a team chronically incapable of winning the biggest prizes. It had been, without wishing to put too fine a point on it, nonsense. The team of 2022-23 got way out ahead of their skis early on but never looked like one that could stay the course when the juggernaut of prime Manchester City built a head of steam. A year later, Mikel Arteta's men were brilliant down the stretch, dropping only five points in their final 14 games. Unfortunately for them, City dropped four. In 2024-25, the title charge never got going because from early on, Arsenal found themselves banjaxed by injuries.Now they are probably the best team in the land. That is how they got to the stage where they are five points clear with a game in hand, still the bookmakers' favorites to win both the Champions League and the Premier League. Theirs is the best defense around and frankly, there is not that much evidence of a superteam to rival them, not when Manchester City haven't really exploited the openings that the leaders keep giving them.This is the truth most fair-minded observers would offer up over Arsenal. It would appear that Arsenal's truth is rather different. They play like a team who have ingested the worst that social media has to say about them. A team that believe there is something innate within them that is not within champions, who see the last seven games not as the sort of wobble they can get away with this year but a sign of the doom that is soon to come. When misfortune comes their way, they respond as if it were inevitable.\nAnd this was another game with a healthy slice of bad luck. In the 56th minute, Piero Hincapie was adjudged to have been onside when he darted onto Gabriel's through ball and clipped a shot over Jose Sa, at that point, this had the feel of a professional away performance. Yes, the visitors had been under Wolverhampton Wanderers' cosh to start the second half, but this is the Premier League. Even the easy games are never that easy.Still, there was nothing to fear. All Arsenal were allowing Wolves was pot sho... aaah, there's another one of them flying past David Raya. Hugo Bueno, making amends for playing Hincapie on in spectacular fashion. Make that six Premier League goals conceded where the shot has an xG value of 0.04 or lower. No team in the division has conceded more. Now, maybe, maybe, maybe there is something in how Arteta sets up his backline. Even a defense as good as Arsenal's has to allow something. Could Hincapie have been out quicker? Should he not have shown the out-of-position left back the outside rather than inviting the shot? Maybe, maybe, maybe but this is still the sort of chance that flies high, wide and not particularly handsome far more often than not. This just seems to be the year where that doesn't happen to Arsenal. The xG value of the 20 shots they have conceded is just 3.16. Since 2020-21, there has not been such a discrepancy for any team in the Premier League. \n\n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            So, of course, it is possible to frame this game as another in the long line of footballings that have happened to Arsenal in this run of 10 points gained and 11 dropped over their last seven matches. You might as well file this alongside the Matheus Cunha and Patrick Dorgu thunderbolts or the almighty fright that Eli Junior Kroupi gave to this team. The Arsenal players certainly did.\"Any question, any criticism, any opinion, you have to take it on the chin today,\" said Arteta. \"That's it. Any bullet, take it, because we didn't perform at the level that is required.\"This was a group of contenders for the biggest titles in the sport who were resolutely unable to take control of a contest against an already relegated opponent. In the half hour between Bueno's goal and Tom Edozie's equalizer, they did not allow a single shot. They only took one though and found themselves outpossessed and outpassed, 106 to 104. \nOn the touchline, Arteta was pleading with his players to calm down but they showed no signs of listening. Too many hoofed clearances to Viktor Gyokeres and latterly Gabriel Jesus. Martin Zubimendi may not have been deployed as a Rodri-style 100-pass-a-game metronome but something has gone wrong when he completes only 12 in half an hour, especially when Declan Rice's radar is so off. Might this have been different if Martin Odegaard were fit? He is the man who can get Arsenal to control the game, to kill a contest with a few hundred passes. Wasn't the whole point of this summer's spending, however, to kick the reliance on individuals?Without control and without threat, Arsenal demanded high standards of their defense. They cannot always live up to those. Gabriel and Raya got themselves in a mess, the ball dropping for Edozie to strike on his debut. There was no fight from Arsenal in the minutes that followed, well at least until the referee had blown up and Jesus shoved Yerson Mosquera.Raising yourself only after the battle is lost, we have seen that before in this competition and it is invariably from the teams who are bottling the title race. It's Kevin Keegan ranting at the Sky cameras, it's William Gallas indulging himself in a little sulk on the St. Andrew's field. It wasn't really Arteta's Arsenal. At least it wasn't before Wednesday. And yet already this feels like a team who expect to etch themselves into the wrong sort of history books.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Availability is often the most underrated skill in fantasy basketball. While per-game production grabs headlines, games played ultimately decide matchups — especially as the season pushes past the All-Star break. In this breakdown, we spotlight 10 top-100 points-per-game producers who have missed no more than two contests all season, giving managers both reliability and impact. From iron men like Mikal Bridges to steady stars such as Julius Randle and Scottie Barnes, these players combine durability with strong category production — a powerful formula for fantasy success down the stretch.Julius Randle, Timberwolves - 56 games played (zero missed)Randle leads the way in scoring among the most available players this season, averaging 22.3 points per game on 49.2 percent shooting. He also continues to deliver solid production across the board with seven rebounds, 5.4 assists, and 1.1 steals in 33.6 minutes per game. Additionally, he retains the ability to score from long range, averaging 1.6 3-pointers, while shooting 32.5 percent from beyond the arc. All these factors combine to make him an extremely valuable piece for any fantasy lineup, while also standing as a major factor in his team's success over the last couple of seasons. DeMar DeRozan - 56 games played (zero missed)Although the Kings' season is going just about as poorly as possible, DeRozan has been professional about showing up each game and delivering his patented offensive punch. On the other hand, the team struggles have certainly taken a toll on his ability to produce like he has in the past. He is averaging 18.7 points per game, which is his lowest mark since the 2012-13 season, while he is also playing 32.4 minutes per game, which is his lowest since his rookie campaign. With his squad well out of the playoff race, it is likely that his playing time and production continue to dwindle as the end of the season draws nearer. Naz Reid, Timberwolves - 56 games played (zero missed)Reid shines as one of the league's most valuable bench players. He continues to show an impressive ability to remain available, as he has played every game this season and missed only a total of three games since the start of the 2023-24 season. He is averaging 14.2 points per game, which ties his career high set last season, and he remains a legitimate 3-point threat, averaging 2.4 made 3s, while shooting 38.5 percent from deep on the season. The luxury of having a big man who can shoot and stay true to his defensive role in the paint, as he averages 6.4 rebounds and 0.9 blocks per game, is a major benefit for his squad.\nJeremiah Fears, Pelicans - 56 games played (zero missed)Fears opened his NBA career with a couple of impressive performances, totaling 30 points on 66.7 percent shooting through his first two games. The strong start led to him earning the starting point-guard job for the next 44 games, before being pushed back to a bench role over the most recent 10 games. He is averaging 13.2 points on 42.9 percent shooting, 3.7 rebounds, 3.1 assists, and 1.3 steals in 25.6 minutes per game on the season, while standing out as one of the few players averaging over 20 minutes per appearance to not miss a game this season. At 19 years old, he still has plenty of time to grow and build on his repertoire, while already being established as a rising star for fantasy managers to watch. Toumani Camara, Trail Blazers - 56 games played (zero missed)Despite some inconsistency in his production, Camara is showing well for his third NBA season, averaging a career-high 13.1 points in 33.4 minutes per game, up from 32.7 minutes per game last season. His most notable improvement has been his 3-point shooting, as he is knocking down 2.6 3s per game, with a 37.1 percent success rate from beyond the arc. This, along with his reputation as a strong defender and a solid track record of availability, makes him an intriguing up-and-coming player at the wing. Donte DiVincenzo, Timberwolves - 56 games played (zero missed)DiVincenzo continues to provide solid value in a starting role with the Timberwolves, and like his two aforementioned teammates on this list, he has yet to miss a game this season. What makes his consistent availability this season even more impressive is the fact that he is averaging a career-high 31.2 minutes per game, leading to career highs of 4.2 assists and 1.4 steals per game. He also remains a strong threat from 3-point range, averaging 3.1 makes on 38.3 percent shooting from deep, but his total field-goal percentage is slumping at 41.2 percent, on track for his second straight season shooting below 44 percent from the field. \nMatas Buzelis, Bulls - 55 games played (zero missed)Despite a turbulent and injury-riddled season for the Bulls, Buzelis has been a great constant and is showing an impressive leap in his sophomore season. He is averaging career highs across the board with 15.2 points, 5.4 rebounds, 2.1 assists, 0.7 steals, and 1.5 blocks in 28.3 minutes per game, emerging as one of the league's most well-rounded two-way contributors. He has the green light to continue to explore his game as a high-ranking option among the Bulls' now revamped roster, and he is likely to continue to prosper down the stretch of the campaign. Mikal Bridges, Knicks - 55 games played (zero missed)Bridges has been the prime example of an \"iron man\", having not missed a game in any of the last four seasons, even playing an 83rd game in 2022-23 due to his being part of a trade. He is also on pace to keep up the streak this year, in his eighth NBA season. His production remains steady and substantial for the role he plays as nearly a fifth option on the offensive end. Bridges averages 15.9 points, 4.2 rebounds, 4.1 assists, 1.4 steals, and 0.8 blocks per game, while shooting 50.4 percent from the field and 38.4 percent from deep. Combined with his availability, that makes him one of the most ideal players to roster in category leagues. Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Hawks - 54 games played (two missed)Alexander-Walker is the only player on this list to have missed more than one game, but his season to date is worthy of recognition here based on the total number of games he has played, along with his massive jump in production. His average of 20.1 points per game is a major leap from his 9.4 points per game from last season and his career high of 11 points per game from his sophomore season. He is also averaging career highs in rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks per game. Of course, the increased production is largely the result of increased playing time, which originally came into effect as a result of Trae Young's injury troubles. Nonetheless, the ability to handle the increased role with relatively impressive consistency is catapulting Alexander-Walker into a new echelon among NBA guards. \nScottie Barnes, Raptors - 54 games played (one missed)Scottie Barnes is quickly becoming noted as one of the league's better defenders, as he is averaging over one steal and one block for a third consecutive season. This is also his third straight season averaging over 19 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 5.5 assists per game, putting him on track to be a clear choice as one of the NBA's most well-rounded stars. Additionally, having missed just one game this season has him on pace to push for a career high in games played, which is a great sign for his squad, after he was limited to 65 games last season and just 60 games in 2023-24.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        FRISCO, Texas -- New Dallas Cowboys defensive coordinator Christian Parker is the opposite of his predecessor Matt Eberflus in a multitude of ways. From Parker's hiring process to the schematics and the stage of their careers when they took this job. When Brian Schottenheimer was hired as the head coach of the Cowboys on Jan. 24 of last year, the hiring of Eberflus as defensive coordinator came four days later on Jan. 28. Eberflus had a high level of familiarity with Dallas from being the team's linebackers coach from 2011 to 2017 before he departed to become the Indianapolis Colts defensive coordinator in 2018. That stint lasted through 2021 before the Chicago Bears made him their head coach in 2022. He was fired midseason in 2024 after a time management debacle on Thanksgiving at the Detroit Lions before returning to the Cowboys as DC in 2025 at the age of 55. Eberflus' Cowboys group lost All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons a week before the season started in a trade with the Green Bay Packers that netted Dallas two first-round picks and three-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kenny Clark. Eberflus' group went on to allow an NFL-worst 30.1 points per game despite Jones trading for New York Jets All-Pro defensive tackle Quinnen Williams at the trade deadline. After Dallas' 34-17 home loss against the Los Angeles Chargers in Week 16, Jones took full accountability for the hire of Eberflus. \n        \n            \n                Prisco's Top 100 NFL free agents for 2026: Market light on big-name talent, but some stars to be had\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"Ultimately, you point your finger right back at you on who hired Matt Eberflus,\" Jones said postgame that day. \"It's easy to say you could have done things differently, but that goes with the territory. Any time you make the ultimate decision, then you've got to look at that and weigh it.\"  \nParker's comprehensive processParker's hiring process was the polar opposite of Eberflus'. Jones, team EVP Stephen Jones and Schottenheimer conducted a comprehensive process by interviewing 40 defensive coaches to fill out their defensive staff in 2026, 9 of whom were considered to fill their defensive coordinator vacancy. Parker was the last candidate they considered. He joined their search in 2026 after multiple NFL stops. Parker worked as a defensive quality control coach with the Green Bay Packers (2019-2020), the defensive backs coach for the Denver Broncos (2021-2023) and then as the Philadelphia Eagles passing game coordinator/defensive backs coach (2024-2025). He left a lasting impression, and now he's the Cowboys' youngest defensive coordinator ever at the age of 34. \"I think this was something where we're excited to say 'hey, let's take a deep breath, let's get it right.' I think we did over 40 total interviews. Nine of which were coordinators,\" Schottenheimer said on Wednesday. \"He [Parker] was the last one by the way. He was the last zoom that we did. Every impression that we had with CP just left us wanting more. The conviction that he has. His curious, calm demeanor, you guys will get to know him. Just the way he carries himself is awesome. But really the process was thorough. It was long. Jerry and Stephen, I think, they hung with me, which is great. We did so many layers of this thing. We got into concepts and techniques at every level. ... But we got into the weeds man and just every time we spent time with CP, it became very clear he was the guy for the job.\"The X's and O's differenceSchematically, Eberflus and Parker couldn't be more different. In 2025, Eberflus ran the same 4-3 defensive front Dallas was running with him at linebackers coach and Rod Marinelli at defensive coordinator with a heavy zone coverage emphasis. That emphasis wasn't a fit with cornerbacks Trevon Diggs and DaRon Bland in 2025, two players who racked up interceptions while running much more man coverage-focused schemes under Dan Quinn and Mike Zimmer. Parker plans to run a 3-4 and be \"multiple\" with his coverage looks while getting to \"know the student[s] first and foremost.\" Translation: Dallas' defense under Parker will mold the system to their players versus Eberflus' approach of trying to mold his players to his system. \n\"First thing, we're going to be multiple. I think that whenever you form a defensive structure, it's about the players that you have,\" Parker said on Wednesday. \"So our core principles, we'll be a 3-4 by nature. 4-3 spacing will be appropriate. 4-2-5 in nickel different front structures, coverages behind it. But I will say being multiple is probably the most important thing about it.\"There's a high level of trust in what Parker will be able to do with Dallas' players, particularly in the secondary -- his area of expertise. He helped mold Broncos cornerback Pat Surtain II into winning 2024 NFL Defensive Player of the Year honors, and multiple Eagles corners, Cooper DeJean and Quinyon Mitchell, earned first team All-Pro selections under his tutelage in 2025. \"Man, every time we talked, we just got off a call or get off a zoom or off an interview, man, I wanted more of that,\" Schottenheimer said. \"I think his ability to develop players is very obvious. You look at what he did in Denver, involved with Surtain, and you look at what they did in Philadelphia. Obviously, with Cooper DeJean, and [Quinyon] Mitchell and things like that, he's done it. A ton of respect for [Eagles defensive coordinator] Vic Fangio. He's cut his teeth under Vic, but he's not Vic. He's got his own convictions and beliefs. That's what I learned about the guy.\"\nHow Parker plans to use Dallas' highly-paid defensive tackle trioThree of the Cowboys' seven highest-paid players are defensive tackles: All-Pro Quinnen Williams (four years, $96 million), Osa Odighizuwa (four years, $80 million) and three-time Pro Bowler Kenny Clark (three years, $64 million). Last year when Williams was acquired at the trade deadline, Eberflus went to a lot of five-down fronts (five defensive linemen on the line of scrimmage). Parker will consider using that as well other looks to ensure all three get snap counts reflective of their contract status. \"I think you have different ways of doing that. Five-down [defensive linemen] is one of them. There are some different four-down structures you can do with that as well,\" Parked said. \"There's six-down presentations you can do that with as well. So like I said earlier, the defensive line and then winning the game upfront is significant. So how we can change the math and get our best players on the field will always be a part of what we do.\"Parker's initial thoughts on the Cowboys' cornerbacksDallas' secondary is set to undergo a makeover this offseason, but two cornerbacks who are guaranteed to be on the roster are 2023 NFL interceptions leader DaRon Bland and 2025 third-round pick Shavon Revel. Right now, Parker is evaluating what he has in Dallas' roster ahead of free agency in March. \n\"They have different strengths. I definitely evaluated Revel last year in the draft process. I had one of his teammates at Denver in Ja'Quan McMillian at ECU, so I had a little bit of intel there,\" Parker said. \"But his ability to erase receivers in press coverage, he's very aggressive in run support, and he has the long speed and athletic traits you want at the position. Obviously, coming off the injury, getting him healthy is a significant part of that and having the confidence to do so. And Bland, he's instinctive with how he takes the ball away at a high rate. You saw that from Sac State to Fresno [State] to now here. I'm excited to do work with those guys.\"What's next?Now that Parker and his defensive staff have been finalized, Schottenheimer and the Jones family are getting together with their new defensive coordinator to make sure they're aligned on the types of players he feels are ideal with how he wants to play. \"Now we're going through the process of making sure the critical factors by position are filled as we get ready to go into an exciting time of the combine, draft prep and free agency and all that stuff,\" Schottenheimer said. \"It's an exciting time, and the one thing you know about our process is it's going to be daily. It's going to be 24/7, 365. Like I said, Jerry is a great listener man. He asks great questions, and I think that's why the way we do it, we have a lot of success because it's very collaborative.\"\nThose player specifications are called critical factors, and they'll be crucial in how the Cowboys look to rebuild the NFL's worst scoring defense in 2026. \"Critical factors by position. So like for corners, what we're looking for at corner whether it's measurables, OK, but then things are going to be asked to do, traits. So obviously we had that filled out on offense, and we had the same thing on defense last year, but they're going to be a little different,\" Schottenheimer said. \"So how you talk about using a 4-I [a defensive lineman lined up on the inside shoulder of the offensive tackle] or how you use the outside linebacker and some of the pieces that we have in place. Then, some of the areas that we need to add through the course of free agency and in the draft.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA), the union that represents those on the 40-player roster for each MLB club, has named Bruce Meyer as the interim executive director for the organization, the group announced late Wednesday. The decision is the result of a unanimous vote by the union's executive board of 72 players and came after Tony Clark unexpectedly resigned from the lead post earlier this week. Clark's decision was made after an internal investigation reportedly revealed he was engaged in an \"inappropriate\" relationship with his sister-in-law, who had been an MLBPA employee since 2023. As well, Clark and the MLBPA are under federal investigation by the Eastern District of New York over whether a licensing company co-founded by the MLBPA and the NFL players union, OneTeam Partners, was being used to financially enrich the union leaders. The full scope of the investigation into the company is unclear, but members of the executive subcommittee have been in contact with federal officials, according to The Athletic. At the same time, an MLBPA-owned youth baseball company, Players Way, is also under investigation for alleged financial impropriety. The company is alleged to have held few live events for youth players despite the MLBPA's investing almost $4 million in the company. Players Way executives and consultants reportedly received six-figure salaries. \n        \n            \n                MLBPA head Tony Clark resigns after alleged 'inappropriate' relationship, months before CBA expires\n                \n                    Kate Feldman                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nClark, 53, joined the MLBPA in 2010 following a 15-year playing career. He was unanimously approved as the union's executive director in December 2013, following the death of Michael Weiner. Clark has overseen the last two CBA negotiations.\"Just on a personal level I think we're all fairly devastated by things that have happened in the last 48, 72 hours,\" Meyer told reporters Wednesday from spring training in Arizona, via the Associated Press, as part of his remarks before being named interim. \"I'm not going to go beyond that in terms of personal feelings, but it's fair to say that we were all personally upset, concerned about Tony. But I think this was something that the players determined had to happen at this particular point in time.\"\nMeyer, 64, has served as the union's lead negotiator since 2018. After helming the negotiations on the current collective bargaining agreement (CBA) in 2021, Meyer was promoted to deputy executive director, Clark's No. 2, in the summer of 2022. Prior to joining the MLBPA, Meyer worked in an executive capacity for the NHL Players Association, and before that he was a long-time attorney in private practice. Matt Nussbaum, a labor lawyer who joined the MLBPA in 2011 after several years at the NHLPA, was named the interim deputy executive director.\n        \n            \n                Six major issues for Tony Clark's MLBPA replacement: Salary cap, international draft, more negotiating tasks\n                \n                    Mike Axisa                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe change in leadership comes at a seemingly inopportune time for the MLBPA, as negotiations on the next CBA should soon begin in earnest. Those negotiations are expected to be contentious, as MLB owners are widely expected to lock out the players after the current CBA expires in December of this year. Commissioner Rob Manfred at the behest of owners is expected to push for a salary cap on team payrolls during the CBA negotiations, and the union is expected to resist those efforts, as they've always done. \n\"We don't expect anything to change in terms of bargaining,\" Meyer said Wednesday. \"We've been preparing for bargaining for years. Players have been preparing. Players know what's coming. At the end of the day, leadership is important and leadership comes and goes, but what remains is the players. At the end of the day, it's the players who determine the direction of the union. At the end of the day, it's the players who determine our priorities and bargaining. Those priorities obviously have not changed and will not change.\"Meyer had been slated to lead those negotiations from the union side, so his appointment to the interim leadership role is as seamless as such a thing can be given the unexpected nature of the recent upheavals. Meyer's ascent within the union has not been without obstacles. In December of 2024, three former members of the MLBPA's executive subcommittee -- Jack Flaherty, Lucas Giolito, and Ian Happ -- angled to remove Meyer as the union's deputy director. However, the three players were then voted off of the subcommittee, and Meyer survived. Now he leads the union into an uncertain future and likely becomes the favorite to take over leadership of the MLBPA on a permanent basis, whenever such a decision will be made. First, though, comes the profound challenges of leading the players into what could be the most damaging labor dispute the sport has seen in more than a generation.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Inter lost 3-1 in the opening first leg of the Champions League playoffs against Bodo/Glimt, the Norwegian side that already won against Manchester City and Atletico Madrid earlier this season. The Nerazzurri will have another chance to bounce back next week in Milan when the second leg will take place on Tuesday at San Siro, but this is a worrying result for the side coached by Cristian Chivu for multiple reasons, especially a few days after they managed to win against Juventus in Milan over the weekend. On the other hand, Bodo/Glimt are no longer a surprise in the European tournament after they managed to win against both Manchester City in their home stadium before winning against Atletico Madrid away in the last match of the league phase. Bodo/Glimt have done what they were asked to -- taking advantage of the home stadium playing on artificial grass -- but Inter were also disappointing, even if we can definitely expect a different match next week in Milan. \nThe Nerazzurri conceded the opening goal in the first half with Sondre Fet before the equalizer of Francesco Pio Esposito before the end of the opening 45 minutes. The Italian striker was once again one of the best players of the team, scoring his second goal in a few days after the key one against Juventus over the weekend. Inter came back on the pitch with a different attitude, not with the right mentality, and conceded two more goals to the home team as former AC Milan striker Jens Hauge and Kasper Hogh set the result to the final 3-1 result. Inter, heavily rotated, struggled throughout the match. The intense atmosphere and the home side's momentum may have unsettled the Nerazzurri, but even so, more was expected from a team that reached the 2025 Champions League final.\nIronically, the best news of the day for Chivu's team came out of the game played at San Siro between AC Milan and Como as Massimiliano Allegri's side drew 1-1 and are now seven points behind the Serie A leaders, with the Derby della Madonnina coming up in two weeks at San Siro, a pivotal clash that will decide the race for the 2025-26 Scudetto.\nOn the other hand, the most worrying news of the day comes not just from the result itself but from the performance, as the Nerazzurri were not able to sustain the rhythm of the home team in the first half, also probably due to the frigid  Norwegian weather. As a consequence, Inter captain Lautaro Martinez left the pitch with a suspected muscular injury that will be assessed in the coming hours once the team is back in Italy, knowing that Inter will face Lecce away on Saturday before the second leg of the playoffs next week. \nInter will need to have a different attitude from the past two matches. Bodo/Glimt might not be the best opponent they have faced so far this season, but a win is mandatory to take the Nerazzurri to the next stage of the tournament before focusing on the Serie A race and potentially on the round of 16. But for Inter to move on, potentially facing Pep Guardiola's Manchester City, they are going to have to win by at least two goals to have a chance, forcing extra time with that margin, while a win of more than two goals sees them through and a one goal win, a draw or  loss resulting in them crashing out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Imagn Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Green Bay coach Doug Gottlieb will miss Friday's game at Oakland as he serves a one-game suspension for his postgame comments after the Phoenix's loss at Milwaukee. The Horizon League announced that it suspended Gottlieb for a violation of the league's operating regulations after he went viral with a rant about the officiating in Sunday's defeat.Gottlieb slammed his fists on a table during an expletive-filled tirade in which he demanded an explanation for a technical foul he received in the 75-72 loss. Gottlieb called upon the Horizon League to explain the \"disparity\" in officiating and to clarify why he received the technical for arguing a call he felt unjustly favored Milwaukee.\"Gottlieb's postgame comments do not reflect the League's values or sportsmanship expectations,\" the Horizon League said in a statement. \"The Horizon League considers this matter closed and will have no further comment.\"\n        \n            \n                Green Bay coach Doug Gottlieb goes on epic rant demanding explanation after technical foul\n                \n                    Kyle Boone                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nGottlieb said that officials evaluated the \"exact same f----ing play\" on both ends of the floor with different outcomes. He also said that he did not curse, leave his box nor act demonstratively while questioning the call during the game. Regardless, Gottlieb was assessed a technical foul with under seven minutes to play while the Phoenix held a one-possession lead.Milwaukee's Amar Augillard converted both technical free throws to cut the Panthers' deficit to 59-58 with 6:58 to play.\n\"I'd like to apologize to the Horizon League and the officials for my disparaging comments following Sunday's game,\" Gottlieb said in a statement. \"I understand and appreciate how difficult their job is, and respect what they do for the sport of basketball. I will be better moving forward.\"The loss halted the Phoenix's three-game winning streak which had seen them move to three games above .500 for just the second time this season. With three regular-season games remaining, Green Bay is 10-7 in league play and just a half-game back of second place in the standings. Gottlieb will miss a critical game against Oakland, which stands in second at 10-6.Every spot in the Horizon League standings matters with the adoption of a new conference tournament format. The top five seeds host on-campus games in the first round, and those that advance will be re-seeded. The three highest seeded teams remaining will advance directly to the semifinals.\nIf Gottlieb can guide Green Bay to a conference tournament championship, he will complete a remarkable turnaround after going 4-28 in his debut season. A run to league supremacy could also give the Phoenix their highest win total since the 2018-19 season -- the last time they crossed the 20-win threshold.\n            \n",

    "body": "\n        Following domestic violence allegations she made last month, a former girlfriend of Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Rashee Rice this week filed a lawsuit against Rice, accusing him of physical assault. Dacoda Jones, the mother of Rice's two children, filed the civil suit in Dallas County (Texas) District Court and seeks $1 million in damages.Jones said in the lawsuit, filed on Monday, that Rice assaulted her over the course of many months from December 2023 through July 2025 and caused severe and permanent injuries.The lawsuit states that Rice strangled Jones at their shared home in Victory Park, Texas, in December 2023 and continued to assault her over the course of their relationship. Many of his alleged acts occurred while Jones was pregnant. In addition to the physical assault, Rice is also accused of abusive behaviors including throwing objects, destroying property and locking Jones out of their home in the middle of the night.Rice responded to the lawsuit via his legal representation.\"On October 9th, 2025, well after the parties' relationship had ended, Ms. Jones stated under penalty of perjury in a sworn Affidavit for Non-Prosecution that 'Mr. Rice and I had a verbal argument, but he did not punch me.' We will allow the legal process to run its course and have no further comment at this time,\" Rice's attorney, Sean Lindsey, said in a statement to ESPN.\nThe Chiefs also issued a statement after the lawsuit was filed.\"The club is aware and remains in communication with the National Football League,\" the team said.Jones did not refer to Rice by name when she brought forth the domestic violence allegations in January. She posted photos to Instagram of herself with a bloody lip and scratches and bruises on her face and body. She accused an unnamed partner of physical abuse, said the couple broke up in late 2025 and mentioned that the former partner locked her outside in freezing weather.\"I'm so tired of keeping quiet I'm so tired of protecting his image,\" Jones said in the since-deleted social media post. \"I've been through enough in the span of 8 years and I've had ENOUGH! I've dealt with abuse for years, me and this man decided to break up a couple months ago and it's been nothing but hell.\n\"He literally left us in Kansas and I had to beg him to send money so that I could drive to Texas with my kids and all our stuff. We have an agreement because of everything he's put me through and he still doesn't follow it. He's now trying to remove me and my kids from our home for no apparent reason. I've known this man for YEARS. He tries to put on this persona like he's dad of the year. He does the bare minimum and I have to beg for that. I've protected his image too long and I'm done doing that. It's time to protect my peace, protect my children and stand up for myself.\"Off-the-field storylines have now followed Rice in each of the last three offseasons. Last summer, the NFL suspended him for the first six games of the 2025 campaign for violating the league's personal conduct policy. The suspension was a result of a traffic incident that occurred in March 2024. Rice pleaded guilty to two felony charges in a hit-and-run and was sentenced to 30 days of jail time and five years of probation.Rice hauled in 53 catches for 571 yards and five touchdowns across eight games last season after serving his suspension. The former second-round NFL Draft pick is entering the final year of his rookie contract with Kansas City.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The long and winding road to Baku proved to be a journey worth making for Anthony Gordon, who took to the field against Qarabag with his form under something of a microscope, and barely half an hour later, he found himself Newcastle United's record goalscorer in the Champions League. Any time you are clearing a high watermark for scoring set by Alan Shearer, you are doing something right.So Gordon was, four goals in the first half, setting Newcastle on course for a convincing 6-1 win in Qarabag that all but guarantees that the Premier League side will be in the hat for the round of 16 draw next week. Records tumbled for the England international inside 33 minutes, Gordon delivering the fastest hat trick ever by an English player in the competition. One more would come before the half was out, pub quiz staple status established as he joined Luiz Adriano (remember him) as the only player to score four goals in a half of Champions League football.The club records are no less notable, though it is fair to say Newcastle do not have a lengthy history in the European Cup. Indeed, with his 15th game, Gordon became the outright record appearance maker for the Magpies. At least he marked it in style with goals seven through 10, three more than the legendary Shearer managed in his brief dalliances in the competition. With all of those coming this season, Gordon finds himself firmly in second in the race for this season's golden boot, trailing Kylian Mbappe by three but two clear of Harry Kane. Two more before Newcastle's competition is over and he will have broken Kane's single-season scoring record for an English player in the competition.\nThat two of his quartet came from the penalty spot spoke to the particularly inept rearguard that Qarabag put up in the first half, Malick Thiaw also able to head home with barely a modicum of pressure on him for his side's second. Then again when the chances did come his way from open play, Gordon looked razor sharp, darting onto a through ball down the right half space and drilling home a first-time shot to open the scoring inside two minutes.\nHis hat-trick goal, seconds after the first penalty, showed a similar explosive pace, allied with the composure to round Mateusz Kochalski, spoke to the sort of impressive qualities in the final third that mean Arsenal and Liverpool count themselves among Gordon's greatest admirers.There might have been even more for Gordon in a second half where Qarabag began to improve. However, Eddie Howe understandably withdrew his No.10 in the first tranche of substitutions just after the hour mark, his replacement Jacob Murphy getting the sixth with a deflected shot from range. There are still 2,500 miles to cover on the return journey and fresh legs will be needed for the trip to Manchester City on Saturday night.\n\n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            Gordon could do with translating some of this European form into the Premier League, where he has three goals, two penalties, to go with the five he has in the Champions League. Some of his off-form in domestic football can be explained by finishing struggles -- he has 4.01 non-penalty expected goals (npxG) -- but it is certainly the case that Gordon looks more effective in the open encounters of continental football. There, he averaged 0.41 npxG per 90 minutes even before tonight's heroics, a quite significant improvement compared to 0.27 npxG in the Premier League. \n            ",

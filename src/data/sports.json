    "body": "\nFrom Super Bowl props like Jaxon Smith-Njigba anytime touchdown (-110) to Patriots vs. Seahawks (-4.5) picks against the spread, to over/under picks (45.5), to money-line picks (Seahawks -230, Patriots +190), your 2026 Super Bowl parlay can go in a number of different directions. Another option is guessing the margin of victory of the game, and there's an NFL betting trend that could help in that regard. Entering Super Bowl 60 three of the last four editions of The Big Game have been decided by exactly 3 points. So, you could back the game's winning margin to be exactly 3 points in a 2026 Super Bowl SGP, which would return +475.Seattle winning by 3 points has +950 NFL prop odds, while New England doing the same carries +1100 odds. You could also make NFL bets on winning bands, such as the Seahawks prevailing by 1-6 points (+275) or New England winning by 1-6 points at +300. But if you want to increase your potential winnings exponentially, then you could string one of these wagers with others into a lucrative Super Bowl same-game parlay. Before making any Super Bowl 60 picks and NFL parlays, you need to see the epic Super Bowl LX same game parlay from SportsLine's proven model that pays out $15,000 on just a $10 bet.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters the 2026 Super Bowl on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now that the simulation model has had a chance to digest the Super Bowl 60 NFL odds, it's locked in its betting picks to form a longshot NFL parlay that could pay out $15,000 for a $10 bettor. You can only see the picks and full parlay by heading to SportsLine.\nTop 2026 Super Bowl parlay picksFor Super Bowl LX, one of the picks featured in the longshot parlay is Patriots receiver Kayshon Boutte as an anytime TD scorer (+330). Despite ranking 68th amongst wideouts in catches (33) in the regular season, Boutte was 18th in positional receiving touchdowns (6). He added another score in the divisional round and then got a red-zone target in the AFC Title Game. While Seattle has an elite defense, through the air is where to exploit that unit. Eight of the last 10 touchdowns the Seahawks have allowed have been via the pass, including all three they gave up in the NFC title game.Boutte has more touchdowns this season than the Pats leading receiver, Stefon Diggs, despite the latter having twice as many targets and receptions. The model projects Boutte to score 0.31 touchdowns, which matches Hunter Henry for the highest amongst all Patriots and brings great value to these plus-money odds as one leg of a Super Bowl SGP. See the rest of the picks in the Super Bowl LX same game parlay here, and you can bet Boutte as an anytime TD scorer using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nHow to make NFL parlay picks for a payout of $15,000The parlay also includes three additional Super Bowl picks from SportsLine's NFL model, including a must-see first NFL touchdown-scorer prop that pays out 25-1. You can only see the Seahawks vs. Patriots picks and the full parlay at SportsLine.What are the top NFL picks for Super Bowl LX that can be combined into an NFL SGP that returns $15,000 on just a $10 bet, and which optimal first touchdown scorer prop pays out 25-1?

    "body": "\nWhether you've made Super Bowl DFS picks before, or this will be your first time playing NFL daily Fantasy for The Big Game, you're aware that someone will come out of nowhere to make a major impact. Thus, NFL DFS lineups should comprise more than just big names like Sam Darnold, Drake Maye, Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Hunter Henry. The Championship Round saw Jake Bobo find the end zone for Seattle and Mack Hollins lead New England in receiving, so those could be the type of underrated options for your daily Fantasy football strategy and Patriots vs. Seahawks DFS lineups.Who should you target from the Super Bowl DFS player pool, and who are the sleepers your NFL DFS strategy should consider to help differentiate your lineups when kickoff comes at 6:30 p.m. ET on Sunday? Before making any NFL DFS picks or locking in Seahawks vs. Patriots DFS lineups on sites like DraftKings and FanDuel for Super Bowl LX, be sure to check out SportsLine's advanced NFL DFS lineup optimizer.\nThe DFS Optimizer uses info from the SportsLine Advanced-Data Projection Model and DFS Professional Millionaire Mike McClure to identify top DFS picks/plays for any slate on betting apps like DraftKings and FanDuel. It simulates every game 10,000 times to help DFS players optimize and build winning DraftKings and FanDuel lineups. Optimize, export, and enter lineups confidently with injury updates, floor and ceiling player projections, and Vegas lines and picks all with one winning tool.Now, SportsLine's NFL DFS Optimizer has turned its attention to Super Bowl LX and just locked in its top daily Fantasy football lineups. You can only see its optimal lineups at SportsLine.Top NFL DFS picks for Super Bowl 60One of the optimizer's top Super Bowl DFS value picks is Seahawks receiver Rashid Shaheed. After a slow start to his Seattle tenure, Shaheed has come on strong as of late. Over his last seven games, he has at least 50 scrimmage yards or a touchdown in five contests. Also, New England is vulnerable to wide receivers finding the endzone against it as just five teams allowed more wideout touchdowns in the regular season than the Patriots. The Pats also gave up a punt return touchdown in 2025, adding to the DFS value Shaheed, who has three return scores this season. See who else to pick here.You can also bet Shaheed to go Over 22.5 total receiving yards at DraftKings:\nThe optimizer's NFL DFS strategy also includes building around Patriots quarterback Maye. While Seattle has the No. 6 total defense, Maye is the first quarterback in NFL history to defeat three top-5 total defenses in a single postseason. So, he won't be intimidated by Seattle's unit, and it was one which was just shredded by Matthew Stafford. In the NFC Title Game, the Seahawks allowed its most passing touchdowns (3) of the year, it's second-highest passer rating (126.5) and its third-most passing yards (370). Add in that Maye has 65-plus rushing yards in two of three postseason games, and he's poised to produce, Fantasy-wise, on Super Bowl Sunday. You can see the rest of the optimizer's NFL DFS picks here.Bet Maye to go Over 264.5 passing plus rushing yards at DraftKings:\nHow to build Patriots vs. Seahawks DFS lineupsThe NFL DFS Optimizer is also targeting multiple undervalued players who could explode for huge numbers in the 2026 Super Bowl. Those players could be the difference between winning your tournaments and cash games or going home with nothing. You can only see who they are, and the rest of the optimizer's NFL DFS picks, at SportsLine. So what is the optimal NFL DFS lineup for Super Bowl Sunday, and which under-the-radar Seahawks vs. Patriots DFS picks offer huge value? Visit SportsLine now to see optimal NFL DFS picks, rankings, advice and stacks, all from an NFL DFS optimizer that simulates every game 10,000 times, and find out.\n            ",

On Saturday, Mario Bautista and Vinicius Oliveira step into the spotlight.People are starting to wake up to the skill of Bautista (16-3). The Arizona native had won eight fights in a row since 2022 before getting a step up opportunity against top contender Umar Nurmagomedov. While he was swept on the scorecards, Bautista put up a strong effort in defeat. Bautista stunned Nurmagomedov with a knee and nearly yanked his foot off with a toehold. His strong showing, plus a dominant win over former Bellator bantamweight champion Patchy Mix, helped mend fan feelings after his contentious win over the great Jose Aldo.\"I thought I blew the [Nurmagomedov] fight. That's the mindset I had,\" Bautista told CBS Sports. \"Being around people saying, 'That was an awesome fight. You actually went out there and fought him. You didn't hold anything back.' I'm glad people saw that from me. I think that's what landed me this main event.\"On Saturday, Bautista can utilize his wealth of experience against a fighter with a rapidly rising profile.\nSign up for Paramount+ and Watch UFC Fight Night: Bautista vs. Oliveira for no additional fee -- every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with your subscription! Plans start as low as $8.99/month or $89.99/year!\"His hand placements,\" Bautista said of Oliveira's technical gaps. \"Outside of the UFC, I saw three separate videos of him getting knocked out. He lives and dies by the sword. I think there's a higher possibility for that to happen the higher you climb up the UFC rankings.Oliveira (23-3) is a madman. He marches forward with his hands down and strikes from odd angles. Oliveira is already calling out elite stars like Nurmagomedov, Sean O'Malley and Merab Dvalishvili only four fights into his UFC career. \"Lok Dog\" won't be far from those conversations if he makes good on his first-round knockout prediction.\nBet UFC Fight Night at DraftKings and get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:\"No one in the top five wants to fight me. They're all close to fighting for the belt. If UFC asked them to fight 'Lok Dog,' they'd say no...\" Oliveira told CBS Sports. \"They don't want to fight me because they have many things to lose. \"I'm dangerous in this division. When you see me fight, you can see I'm crazy. I move forward with my hands down. I dodge stuff and throw punches from nowhere. I'm not technical or orthodox. It's strange to fight me. If I were someone in front of me, I'd run away. I wouldn't want to face me.\"\nLet's take a look at the rest of the fight card with the latest odds from DraftKings before getting to a prediction and expert pick on the main event below.UFC Fight Night card, oddsOdds via DraftKings SportsbookFavoriteUnderdogWeightclassMario Bautista -170Vinicius Oliveira +142Bantamweight  Kyoji Horiguchi -375Amir Albazi +295FlyweightJailton Almeida -155Rizvan Kuniev +130HeavyweightMichal Oleksiejczuk -500Marc-Andre Barriault +380MiddleweightFarid Basharat -285Jean Matsumoto +230BantamweightDustin Jacoby -185Julius Walker +154Light heavyweightUFC Fight Night viewing informationDate: Saturday, Feb. 7 | Start time: 8 p.m. ETLocation: Meta APEX -- Las VegasStream: Paramount+ (subscribe now for as little as $8.99 per month)PredictionMario Bautista vs. Vinicius Oliveira: Oliveira doesn't seem concerned with Bautista, technique, or much else. You can chalk up his swagger to some combination of confidence and stubbornness. Oliveira was a vicious KO artist on the regional scene. Things haven't come so easily for him in the UFC. He might not like that, but I do. Oliveira showed that his skills hold up over 15 minutes. Saturday's headliners are surprisingly similar considering their contrasting personalities and game plans. They have comparable striking offense and defense stats, though Oliveira sees less artillery coming his way. They're also difficult to ground. I'm torn here. Bautista's performance against Nurmagomedov opened my eyes to how good he is. I don't think he'll finish Oliveira, and that creates concerns about a potential KO loss over 25 minutes. However, Oliveira's inexperience against elite fighters and failure to finish his last three opponents are more concerning. I'll side with the veteran over five rounds. Pick: Bautista via unanimous decisionWho wins Bautista vs. Oliveira, and how exactly does the fight end? Visit SportsLine now to get detailed picks and analysis from the advanced model that showed a 6.1% ROI from over 500 fights from 2023-25, and find out.\n            ",

They have feasted on the bottom of the Big Ten, inflating their defensive stats,\" SportsLine expert Jeff Hochman said. \"When faced with a Tier-1 offense (like Michigan's), their defense cracked. Illinois presents an even more potent offensive challenge than Michigan. Close Game Separation Metrics heavily favor Illinois. In tight games, Illinois has consistently executed in the half-court, whereas Michigan State has suffered from subpar backcourt play from everyone not named Jeremy Fears Jr. Illinois has validated these numbers away from home. Their Strength of Schedule adjusted performance includes road wins at Purdue and Nebraska—two of the toughest environments in the Big Ten. I like the road team in this spot.\" Back Illinois at bet365 here:\nLooking for more NBA and college basketball picks?You've seen the model's best bets for Saturday.

    "body": "\nThe Super Bowl brings the most betting opportunities of any sporting event each year, and Super Bowl 60 between the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots is no different. One of the popular Super Bowl props is the MVP award, which is handed out after the game. Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold is the +120 favorite (risk $100 to win $120) in the Super Bowl 60 odds at DraftKings, while Patriots quarterback Drake Maye is +240. While quarterbacks are the most likely winners, three of the last 10 winners have come from non-quarterback positions. Jaxon Smith-Njigba (+500) and Kenneth Walker III (+850) are next on the NFL odds board. There are plenty of longshot betting opportunities for other players in Patriots vs. Seahawks. CBS Sports gambling and Fantasy sports managing editor R.J. White went 718-623-37 on NFL against-the-spread picks from 2017-24, returning more than $3,200 to $100 players as SportsLine's No. 1 NFL expert in ATS picks. He's also gone 22-15-1 (+545) in his last 38 over/under picks, and now he's sharing his Super Bowl 60 MVP picks.Here are the latest odds for Super Bowl 60 at DraftKings:\nSuper Bowl MVP picksBest bet: Seahawks QB Sam Darnold (+120)Best longshot value: Patriots WR Mack Hollins (+18000)Defensive longshot: Seahawks LB DeMarcus Lawrence (+9000)Sam Darnold, Seahawks (+120)\"When it comes to taking a player to win Super Bowl MVP, the safest play is to back a quarterback,\" White said. \"Fourteen of the last 19 Super Bowl MVPs have been quarterbacks, with the position winning the award 34 times overall versus eight times for receivers, seven times for running backs and 10 times for any defensive player. With the Seahawks being huge favorites on the money line, taking Darnold to win Super Bowl MVP presents the best value on the board by getting plus odds for them winning and the award going to the most likely candidate.\"Mack Hollins, Patriots (+18000)\"The Patriots have been criticized for playing an easy schedule this year, but when the tougher opponents have shown up, Hollins has tended to be more involved in the offense,\" White said. \"After a quiet first seven weeks, he caught all seven of his targets for 89 yards in Week 8 against a Browns defense that held Stefon Diggs to 14 yards. He delivered a season-best 106 yards on 10 targets in Week 10 in a close game against the Buccaneers, again outperforming Diggs by a wide margin. He had just 41 yards in Week 15 against the Bills but saw a team-high eight targets in the game while Diggs had four, and then the next week Hollins racked up 69 yards on nine targets in a comeback win over the Ravens, with Diggs leading the team in all receiving categories in that one. Hollins went to IR after that game and returned for the AFC Championship, where he recorded catches of 31 and 20 yards in a game where Maye threw for just 86 yards total.\"Hollins definitely doesn't deserve to be among the favorites for the award, but he should be much closer to Stefon Diggs (+5500) considering how much Maye leans on the secondary receiver in big games. And when compared to the other players ahead of Hollins in odds, including guys like Jake Bobo and George Holani who may not make any impact on the box score for Seattle as well as both backup QBs and a number of defensive players, Hollins stands out as the best value pick on the board.\"DeMarcus Lawrence, Seahawks (+9000)\"There hasn't been a defensive player to win Super Bowl MVP since Von Miller 10 years ago, but it happens more than you think and doesn't necessarily have to be the best defender on the team, with Malcolm Smith and Dexter Jackson taking home the award this century as well,\" White said. \"While that brings super longshots like Jaylinn Hawkins (+25000) and Drake Thomas (+25000) into play, my favorite defensive pick is Lawrence. He'll be up against a Patriots offensive line that has struggled to protect Maye during the playoffs, and the quarterback has had a massive issue hanging onto the ball.\"Lawrence has a sack and forced fumble in three of his last four games, and he's recorded at least one QB hit in 13 of the last 14 games. With the veteran playing in his first Super Bowl after more than a decade with the Cowboys, he could continue his recent fine form, and if he can score a touchdown after recovering a fumble, which he did twice against the Cardinals earlier this year, he could be in contention for this award in a lower-scoring game. I'd put Lawrence at least as the co-favorite among Seahawks defenders, but he's slotted behind Ernest Jones and Nick Emmanwori, so he's my favorite value among the defenders.\"Want more Super Bowl 60 picks?Head to SportsLine for more Super Bowl picks, both from proven experts and the SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every game 10,000 times and enters the 2026 Super Bowl on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024.

Gore spent parts of eight seasons in Major League Baseball. While he logged just 85 total plate appearances in those eight seasons with the Royals, Cubs, Dodgers, and Mets, his elite speed and base-running smarts made him a bench weapon in three different postseasons. For his career, Gore batted .216/.310/.270 with 43 stolen bases in 52 attempts and time spent at all three outfield positions. In the playoffs, Gore played in 11 games, each time as a pinch-runner. While he batted just twice in postseason play, he also stole five bases in six attempts and scored three runs. One of those runs came in Game 2 of the 2014 World Series, a series that the Royals eventually lost to the Giants in seven games. The next year, Gore earned a World Series ring as a member of those same Royals, the team that originally drafted him with a 20th-round selection in 2011. Gore was also a member of the Dodgers in 2020 and, for a time, on their playoff roster, but he did not appear in a playoff game during Los Angeles' run to the title in that COVID-abbreviated season. As well, Gore appeared in a playoff game for the Braves in 2021, when they went on to win the World Series. \nA Georgia native, Gore attended college in Panama City, Florida. According to MLB.com, Gore is survived by his wife and three children, who live in Panama City. At the time of his passing, Gore was working as a baseball trainer and also coaching his son's youth team. \n            \n    ",

With a collection of proven Olympic veterans and rising stars, the Americans have shown through their first two games that they have the team to compete for another gold medal.The Americans were dominant to open Olympic play on Thursday with a 5-1 win over Czechia and that strong start continued Saturday with a 5-0 blowout over Finland. Team USA jumped out to a 1-0 lead after the first period and then poured it on with three goals in the second. Taylor Heise and Megan Keller scored twice in a 66-second span before team captain Hilary Knight made history. Knight tied the American goals record with her 14th Olympic goal, giving the U.S. a 4-0 lead in the process. \nAlong with Canada, Team USA is one of just two countries that has won gold in women's ice hockey since the event was added to the Olympics in 1998. The Americans won that inaugural year in Nagano, then endured four straight Canadian victories until 2018, when Team USA struck back with a dramatic overtime win to capture gold in Pyeongchang.Team USA is poised to retake its place atop the international hockey hierarchy, and it enters the Olympics as the favorite to win gold. According to FanDuel Sportsbook, it's another two-horse race between the U.S. (-155) and Canada (+115), at least on paper. The next closest gold medal contenders are Czechia (+6000) and Sweden (+6000).As is typically the case, the Americans have put together a roster that's loaded at every position, and there's a good mix of experience and youth. Knight is making her fifth Olympic appearance, and star Kendall Coyne Schofield will make her fourth Olympic appearance. Defenders Megan Keller and Lee Stecklein are also familiar with the Olympic stage. Meanwhile, rising stars Taylor Heise, Carlone Harvey and Laila Edwards are getting their first taste of Olympic action.The Americans continue this Olympic journey with a matchup against Switzerland on Monday, and we'll keep you up to date with each result along the way.\nU.S. women's hockey scheduleAll times EasternPreliminary roundThursday, Feb. 5: USA 5, Czechia 1 Saturday, Feb. 7: USA 5, Finland 0USA vs. Switzerland | Monday, Feb. 9 | 2:40 p.m. | USA NetworkUSA vs. Canada | Tuesday, Feb. 10 | 2:10 p.m. | USA NetworkQuarterfinalTBD vs. TBD | Friday, Feb. 13 | 3:10 p.m. | TBDSemifinalTBD vs. TBD | Monday, Feb. 16 | 10:40 a.m. | TBDBronze medal game\nTBD vs. TBD | Thursday, Feb. 19 | 8:40 a.m. | TBDGold medal gameTBD vs. TBD | Thursday, Feb. 19 | 1:10 p.m. | TBD\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        North Dakota State and the Mountain West Conference are engaged in deep discussions on a deal that would bring the FCS powerhouse into the conference as a football-only member starting this fall, a source familiar with the negotiations told CBS Sports on Friday.A deal had not been finalized as of Friday night, but progress was being made toward an agreement that would elevate North Dakota State to the FBS level. Such a move would require a negotiated entry fee paid to the Mountain West, in addition to the NCAA's $5 million FBS transition fee. The size of the Mountain West's entry fee remains under discussion, a source said.If completed, the move would mark one of the most significant FCS-to-FBS transitions in recent history. North Dakota State has won 10 national championships since 2011, including its most recent title in 2024. They are 9-5 all-time against FBS opponents, with five wins over power conference programs.\"North Dakota State University is regularly involved in conversations about the future of collegiate athletics, including conference affiliation,\" the university said Saturday in a statement posted on X. \"We are aware of media reports and will have no further comments.\"\nThe program has publicly signaled its desire to move to the FBS level in recent months under athletic director Matt Larsen and outgoing university president David Cook, who is set to become president at Iowa State University on March 1. Cook's final day at North Dakota State is Sunday, potentially setting the stage for a notable final act.Larsen said last month that the school's interest in exploring FBS membership was \"as strong as it's ever been.\"\"I would say in terms of our position, I think both myself and president Cook, we want to play at the highest level,\" Larsen said on \"Hot Mic with Dom Izzo\" on Jan. 22. \"And right now, the highest level is FBS football. The things that we've done over the course of the last decade have positioned us to be able to do that. And if there's an opportunity, I think it's something we would absolutely explore. If there's not an opportunity, we're poised to continue competing at FCS at a really, really high level and compete for championships.\"\nAt the time, Larsen said the Mountain West had not initiated contact with NDSU. Talks between Mountain West leadership, conference presidents and North Dakota State administrators intensified earlier this week, sources told CBS Sports.The negotiations come during a pivotal stretch for the Mountain West. The conference announced new media rights agreements this week with CBS Sports, FOX Sports and Kiswe through the 2031-32 season, and added The CW under a five-year deal running through 2030-31.The league is also preparing for the departures of Boise State, Colorado State, Fresno State, San Diego State and Utah State, all of which will join the re-formed Pac-12 next fall. The Mountain West has backfilled those openings with UTEP, UC Davis, and Northern Illinois. Hawaii was added as a football-only member in 2012 but joins in all sports beginning in 2026. Northern Illinois will join as a football-only member in 2026, while UC Davis' football program will remain in the FCS as a member of the Big Sky Conference.\nThe Mountain West will continue to play an eight-game conference schedule in football next season, a source said. Matchups for the 2026 season were announced in December, though dates have not yet been finalized. Projected schedules that include North Dakota State are now being modeled and would require minor adjustments.If North Dakota State finalizes a move to the Mountain West, the program would be required to complete a two-year transition period at the FBS level, rendering it ineligible for the College Football Playoff and bowl games in 2026 and 2027. The school could still accept a bowl bid if there are not enough bowl-eligible teams to fill available slots.There are currently 136 FBS programs. Delaware and Missouri State completed their first full FBS seasons in 2025.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Darren Yamashita-Imagn Images\n            \n            \n    \n        SAN FRANCISCO -- The New England Patriots are on the doorstep of kicking off Super Bowl LX, where they'll play the Seattle Seahawks for the chance to hoist the Lombardi Trophy. Even with the organization on the precipice of playing for a championship, it's still mind-boggling that they're in this position so early in their rebuild. After all, New England entered the 2025 regular season with 80-1 odds to win the Super Bowl after enduring back-to-back 4-13 seasons. While the thought of them reaching the NFL's final plateau may have felt near-impossible at the start of the year, it didn't take long for them to start flexing their Super Bowl potential. In fact, Drake Maye noted on Thursday the team's victory in Week 5 against the Bills in Buffalo as one of the early indicators of their Super Bowl ceiling. \"I know probably the win on the road at Buffalo was huge for us,\" Maye said from the podium outside the Patriots team hotel. \"I think just finding a way to win that game against a tough opponent on the road, a team that's been historically great in playoffs, had a home game win streak, and being able to win there.\"\n        \n            \n                Three voters turned NFL MVP race upside down: How Justin Herbert and Josh Allen helped Matthew Stafford win\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBuffalo had been riding a 14-game home winning streak coming into that matchup and had just wrapped up the opening month of the regular season with a perfect 4-0 record. Meanwhile, New England was .500 out of the gate at 2-2, but that victory in what was essentially a playoff-like atmosphere in Orchard Park did feel like an inflection point.\nIt ultimately helped change the balance of power in the AFC East for the rest of the season and it also proved to be one of the origins of their road \"Warriors\" mantra they've been using throughout this playoff run.\"But really, other than that, I think just the continued success on the road has been huge for us,\" Maye added. \"Continued success on the road and trying to find a way to do it one more time here.\"\nThe Patriots come into this Super Bowl after posting a 9-0 record (including playoffs) on the road, a feat that had never been accomplished before in league history. While this Super Bowl will technically be a neutral-site game, they'll look to hold on to that magic of winning outside Foxborough, just as they did in that game back in early October, on Sunday. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 NBA Slam Dunk Contest field is set, and the headlining event on Saturday night will be extremely light on star power. Jaxson Hayes of the Los Angeles Lakers, Carter Bryant of the San Antonio Spurs, Keshad Johnson of the Miami Heat and Jase Richardson of the Orlando Magic will be the four competing for the Dunk Contest crown. That field came as a bit of a surprise, as first-time All-Star Jalen Duren from the Detroit Pistons was reportedly planning on participating but ultimately declined. That leaves the field without an All-Star competitor once again, and fans will likely head into the 2026 edition without lofty expectations. Bryant, Johnson and Richardson will inject a bit of youth into the proceedings, and we've seen in the past that sometimes the unknown competitors can breathe some life into the event. That's certainly what the NBA will hope for, but fans will likely enter the night a bit skeptical that the Dunk Contest will deliver high marks. Hayes recently went between the legs for a slam on a fastbreak against the Chicago Bulls and is known for his high-flying theatrics. Hayes, a 7-footer, is averaging 6.4 points and 3.8 rebounds per game this season for the Lakers.\nBryant, an athletic first-year player out of Arizona, has played in 40 games this season as a first-round pick. He is averaging 2.8 points and 1.8 rebounds in 8.6 minutes per game. Richardson, a rookie out of Michigan State, has played in 36 games this season and is averaging 5.1 points per game in 12 minuter per night in Orlando. Johnson is in his second year in the league with the Heat and has appeared in 21 games, averaging 3.1 points per game in 7.6 minutes of action per night. \nMac McClung will not participateThree-time Slam Dunk Contest champion Mac McClung will not participate in this year's event after he was waived by the Indiana Pacers in November following a three-game stint.While his NBA opportunities have been limited, McClung made a reputation as a supreme athlete with elite dunking ability. He won the league's midseason extravaganza at each of the last three All-Star weekends. McClung also boasts a track record as a G League standout and won the MVP award at the end of a stellar year with the Osceola Magic last fall.NBA All-Star Weekend will take place Feb. 13-15 at the Intuit Dome in Inglewood, California, home of the Los Angeles Clippers. The Slam Dunk Contest is scheduled for Feb. 14. The 10 starters for the All-Star Game -- which will feature a new format -- were announced in January.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        SAN FRANCISCO -- There have been 59 Super Bowls in NFL history, and in that time, there has been one notable scoring play that has somehow never happened: A punt return for a touchdown. Since the first Super Bowl was played in 1966, the game has seen almost every scoring play possible: Safety? Yup. We've seen that before. Blocked punt returned for a touchdown? Already happened. Pick-six? There have been several of those. Blocked field goal for a touchdown? Ask Garo Yepremian about that. Not only has there never been a punt returned for a touchdown, but the Super Bowl is the one game where there has never really been any long punt returns, period. There have only been two returns longer than 50 yards: Jordan Norwood had a 61-yard return for the Broncos in Super Bowl 50 and Kadarius Toney followed that up seven years later with a record-setting 65-yard return in Super Bowl LVII. Toney got tackled five yards away from the end zone to keep the drought alive. \n        \n            \n                Every Super Bowl halftime performer ever: Full list as Bad Bunny headlines Super Bowl LX in 2026\n                \n                    Shanna McCarriston                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nYou know what, let's check out the longest punt returns in Super Bowl history. \nIf a punt return touchdown is ever going to happen, this feels like the year where we could finally see one. Super Bowl XL will feature two of the most explosive returners in the NFL with New England's Marcus Jones and Seattle's Rashid Shadeed. \nThere were only 15 punt return touchdowns in the NFL during the 2025 season and this duo combined for three of those. If anyone can do it, it's definitely Jones, who tied for the NFL lead with an average of 17.3 yards per return. He had two punt returns of more than 85 yards this season that both ended with a score, including a 94-yarder against the Giants in December. \nIf Jones gets in the open field, he could certainly make Super Bowl history. During Super Bowl Opening Night on Monday, Jones admitted that he had just become aware of the fact that no one had ever returned a punt for a touchdown in the Super Bowl. \"I got educated about that about an hour ago,\" Jones said. \"I would love to be part of history.\"\nIf Jones can't end the punt return drought, then maybe Shaheed can. The Seahawks returner has been just as explosive as his Patriots' counterpart.  Shaheed had arguably the biggest punt return touchdown by any player this season back in Week 16 against the Rams. His 58-yard return helped spark the Seahawks to a 38-37 comeback win, a victory that helped Seattle eventually lock up the No. 1 overall seed in the NFC. \nShaheed was the only player in the NFL this year to have both a kick return touchdown and a punt return touchdown. Basically, he knows what to do once he's in the open field, so a punt return touchdown certainly isn't out of the question. \nShaheed was acquired just before the trade deadline in November and he's been a crucial part of Seattle's run to the Super Bowl. In the divisional round of the playoffs, he opened up the game by returning the opening kickoff 95 yards for a score in a 41-6 win over the 49ers. The Seahawks speedster is just the seventh player over the past 50 years to enter the Super Bowl with three return touchdowns under his belt (On top of his returns against Los Angeles and San Francisco, he also had a kickoff return touchdown against the Falcons in Week 14). In the previous six instances where a returner came in to the Super Bowl with three return touchdowns, three of the players ended up scoring on a return in the Super Bowl (Desmond Howard, Devin Hester, Jacoby Jones). All of their touchdowns came on kick returns, but Shaheed is obviously in some good company and he has the talent to possibly score on a punt. Back in Super Bowl 50, Norwood became the first punt returner to take a kick back at least 60 yards and that came at Levi's Stadium. The 60th anniversary of the Super Bowl is being played in the same stadium and with two talented returners like Shaheed and Jones on the field, don't be surprised if we see history made. \nJones once had a walk-off touchdown on a punt return against the Jets in 2022 and he'd be more than happy if Super Bowl XL ends the same way. \"If that was to happen, I would love to have that pressure up on myself and just take advantage of the opportunity,\" Jones said. What this all means is that this is the one year where you won't want to be taking a bathroom break when the punt team comes out on to the field. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        SAN FRANCISCO -- After surviving an earthquake on Monday, I've decided I'm officially ready to make my Super Bowl pick. As everyone knows, any time the Super Bowl is in San Francisco, you have to survive at least one earthquake before you can make your pick, so here we are. It's time. Actually, forget everything I just wrote, because the Super Bowl isn't even in San Francisco. It's in Santa Clara. Why is the Golden Gate Bridge EVEN in the Super Bowl logo? I have no idea. I feel so used.\nAnyway, not only is the game in Santa Clara, but the NFL decided to hold Super Bowl Opening Night in San Jose on Monday, so if this pick sounds like an incoherent mess, that's because I wrote it at 1 a.m. PT after attending that event.The biggest surprise of Opening Night is that I'm 71% sure that I heard Pat Patriot speak Spanish. \nIs that going to have any impact on my Super Bowl pick? Maybe. Let's get to the pick and find out. Also, since I'll be in San Francisco this week, feel free to start following me on Facebook or Twitter or Instagram or EVEN TIKTOK. Yup, I started a TikTok account this week and I already regret it. There's a good chance I'll also eventually regret my Super Bowl pick.\n        \n            \n                Prisco's pick for Seahawks vs. Patriots in Super Bowl 2026: Stout Seattle defense shuts down New England\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSuper Bowl LX pick: New England (17-3) vs. Seattle (16-3)Date: Feb. 8 | Time: 6:30 p.m. ET (NBC)Location: Levi's Stadium, Santa Clara (California) I'm going to go ahead and assume that most of you haven't started planning your Super Bowl parties for next year, but you might want to get on that, because Super Bowl LXI is being played on Valentine's Day. That's right: After taking over Thanksgiving and Christmas, the NFL is now coming for Valentine's Day. Nothing is sacred anymore. At this point, it's probably too late to change the date of this year's game, but if the NFL was going to play one Super Bowl on Valentine's Day, it should have been this one, because this Super Bowl is all about breakups and finding someone new.\nYou want a bitter breakup? That's what happened between the Titans and Mike Vrabel. You know the type of breakup where the you never talk to your ex again. That was this. Vrabel hates the Titans. The Patriots played the Titans this year and Vrabel wouldn't even look at Titans owner Amy Adams-Strunk. \nAfter taking a year away from the dating pool, Vrabel ended up with the Patriots and everything has worked out so far. You want an amicable breakup? That was what the Seahawks did with Pete Carroll. Everyone has been in a relationship like this: It runs its course and it's just best for both sides to end it. The Seahawks finally cut ties with Carroll in 2024 and immediately replaced him with Mike Macdonald. The breakup has worked out for everyone involved. Well, except for Carroll. \nYou want a breakup that makes no sense? That was the Vikings getting rid of Sam Darnold. They had a good thing going, but the Vikings decided they'd better off with someone younger. This was the kind of breakup where someone gets dumped by someone they still liked, but they immediately upgrade to someone better. Why did the Vikings let Darnold go? I still have no idea. Their decision to let him leave was so bad that they fired their general manager (Kwesi Adofo-Mensah) just five days after Darnold led the Seahawks to the Super Bowl and I don't think that was a coincidence. I know what you're thinking right now and it's probably something along the lines of \"Breech, your Super Bowl pick is talking so much about breakups that it's starting to sound like a teenage girl's diary. Are you going to make a prediction on this game or not?\"The answer to that is yes. The reason we're talking about breakups is because I think that out of those three guys -- Darnold, Vrabel or Macdonald -- one of them is going to decide the Super Bowl. And I have a feeling it's going to be Macdonald. \nSince being hired by the Seahawks in 2024, Macdonald has absolutely dominated young quarterbacks, and now he gets to face the second-youngest starting quarterback in the history of the Super Bowl (Drake Maye). In his two seasons on the job, Macdonald has coached six games against first- or second-year quarterbacks and he's gone 6-0 in those games. Those wins have come against good quarterbacks like Bo Nix, Jayden Daniels and Caleb Williams. Not only is he undefeated, but the six quarterbacks have averaged just 168.8 yards passing while throwing nine interceptions compared to just two touchdowns. Oh, and they've been sacked a total of 23 times, which definitely is NOT good news for Maye, who I think got sacked 23 times in every playoff game he played this year (OK, that's a slight exaggeration. He's only been sacked 15 times in three playoff games, but that's still SECOND MOST in a single season in NFL history). This is one game where I don't think the Patriots can afford to play from behind and the problem with that is that if you're playing the Seahawks, there's a 99.9% chance that you'll be playing from behind at some point. The Seahawks have held a DOUBLE-DIGIT lead in 11 of their past 14 games and two of those games where they didn't came against the Rams. If you take those out, it's 11 of 12 games. \nIf the Seahawks force New England to play from behind, that means Maye will be throwing more and the Patriots haven't been great in those situations. Maye has had 11 games in his career where he's thrown 33 passes or more and the Patriots have gone 3-8 in those games. Maye only has two games in his career where he's thrown multiple interceptions and both of those came in one of those games where he was forced to throw the ball at least 33 times. Basically, when Maye has been forced to carry the team by throwing the ball a lot, the Patriots haven't done well, so if the Seahawks turn New England into a one-dimensional passing offense, this could get ugly. I have no idea which Maye is going to show up on Sunday: Playoff Maye or regular-season Maye. He played at an MVP level during the regular season, but he's struggled in the playoffs. You can blame it on his bad shoulder, you can blame it on the fact that the Patriots have faced some good defenses or you can blame it on the fact that he doesn't like his wife's chocolate date bars. I don't care what you blame it on, but it's a fact.Let's check out the numbers:Drake Maye statsCompletion percentageYards per attemptTD/INT ratioPasser ratingRegular season72%8.935/11113.5Postseason56%6.95/584.0During the regular season, the Patriots were the second-highest scoring team in the NFL at 28.8 points per game. In the playoffs, that number has dropped down to 18 points per game. Before this season, do you know how many teams had made the Super Bowl over the past 45 years while averaging 18 points per game in the playoffs? ZERO.If you can't score more than 18 points against Seattle, you're not going to win, it's that simple. There were only two games all year where the Seahawks scored fewer than 18 points and they BOTH came against the 49ers, a divisional opponent that knows them well. The Patriots do not know them well. The only way the Patriots are going to be able to stay in this game is if their defense can slow down Seattle's offense and I just don't think that's going to happen. This is the Starbucks (Seattle) versus Dunkin' (Boston) Super Bowl, and I have to say, I'm a Starbucks guy. Just like Harold Landry. \nI'm going to say the Seahawks roll to a win, but they only get eight minutes to celebrate before the NFL steps in and forces the sale of the team by holding a live auction on the field after the game. \nSuper Bowl pick: Seahawks 34-20 over PatriotsRecord picking Seahawks games this season: 14-5Record picking Patriots games this season: 14-6\nChampionship Sunday Best pick: I predicted that the Patriots would beat the Broncos by three points in the AFC title game and guess what happened? The Patriots beat the Broncos by exactly three points in the AFC title game. In my prediction for the game, I wrote that the Broncos might be able to pull off the upset if Jarrett Stidham doesn't make any back-breaking mistakes, but then he immediately went out and made a back-breaking mistake.\nThe Broncos losing was probably for the best, because I'm not sure any of us were quite ready for Stidham in the Super Bowl. Worst pick: In the NFC title game, I predicted that Matthew Stafford would torch the Seahawks defense and that the Rams would end up winning and I'm giving myself a half a point for that because Stafford did end up torching the Seahawks' defense. As a matter of fact, Stafford was so good that he actually made NFL history, but not in the kind of way you want to make history. \nOver the course of league history, NFL quarterbacks who throw for at least 320 yards with at least two touchdown passes and zero interceptions in a playoff game are 34-11 and that breaks down like this: Stafford is 1-3Every other QB combined is 33-8Stidham threw for like 9 yards, turned the ball over twice and his team somehow managed to only lose by three. Stafford put together one of the best conference title game performances of all time and his team lost by more than three. The NFL is unfair. All right, guys, I have some sad news. This was my final picks column of the season, which means I am now going to go into hibernation and do nothing for the next seven months. Just kidding, that's not how things work. I'll still be writing over the next seven months, but the picks won't be returning until September. If you can't wait that long, then I highly suggest you sign up for our NFL newsletter, which I'm in charge of. It's basically the offseason version of this picks column except without the picks. You can sign up by clicking here (Just look for the Pick Six newsletter). \nIf you sign up, I'll see you soon. If you don't sign up, I'll see you in September for the opener, but you should sign up.Picks recordStraight up for AFC and NFC title games: 1-1SU overall in playoffs: 6-6Against the spread for title games: 1-1ATS overall in playoffs: 3-9Final 2025 regular-season recordStraight up: 166-105-1Against the spread: 129-140-3\nYou can find John Breech on Facebook or Twitter and if he's not doing one of those things, he is probably trying to gently break the news to his wife that he won't be home for Valentine's Day next year.\n            ",

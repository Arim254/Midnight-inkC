    "body": "\n        UFC 322 has a case for being the year's best pay-per-view on paper. Two superfights -- Islam Makhachev vs. Jack Della Maddalena, and Valentina Shevchenko vs. Weili Zhang -- sit atop the marquee, with an undercard packed with contenders and a former champion.The welterweight and middleweight divisions are well represented in New York. Sean Brady vs. Michael Morales could determine the next challenger for Makhachev or Della Maddalena, while former champion Leon Edwards battles the dynamic Carlos Prates. Over at 185 pounds, Bo Nickal looks to redeem his first career loss. In a separate bout, Roman Kopylov dukes it out with a middleweight slugger.Ahead of UFC 322, let's take a look at three non-title fights that you shouldn't miss.\n        \n            \n                UFC 322 card -- Jack Della Maddalena vs. Islam Makhachev: Five biggest storylines to watch in New York\n                \n                    Brian Campbell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSean Brady vs. Michael MoralesMeet two men reshaping the 170-pound weight class. Brady and Morales are part of the new age welterweight -- along with champion JDM, Shavkat Rakhmonov and Ian Machado Garry -- taking over the division. Brady (No. 2) is risking a lot against Morales (No. 8), a relatively new addition to the mix. Brady is a monstrous grappler and athlete. He's coming off his biggest win yet, a submission over former champion Edwards. Morales is a bonus hunting, knockout machine with first-round stoppages against veterans Gilbert Burns and Neil Magny. A combined 36-1, the winner could likely challenge Makhachev or Della Maddlena for UFC gold.\nLeon Edwards vs. Carlos PratesEdwards and Prates fight with heavy chips on their shoulders. Edwards is coming off consecutive losses for the first time, a stark contrast to the career heights preceding it as welterweight champion. It's been a bad year for Prates' Fighting Nerds. The collective had a breakout 2024, but their momentum didn't carry through 2025. Prates and his teammates -- Caio Borralho, Jean Silva and Mauricio Ruffy -- all lost key fights this year. There's still hope for the Brazilian conglomerate. Prates stopped Geoff Neal with a memorable spinning back elbow in August. If he can carry that momentum through a win over Edwards, Prates will be the closest among his contingent to a title shot. For Edwards, victory is imperative to hang on in a rapidly changing welterweight landscape.\nRoman Kopylov vs. Gregory RodriguesThere are two frontrunners for Fight of the Night: Kopylov vs. Rodriguez and Beneil Dariush vs. Benoit Saint-Denis. Although the lightweight clash has higher-ranked contenders, and Saint-Denis has the most upside of all four athletes, there's something about this middleweight collision that I can't shake. Kopylov and Rodrigues are ferocious strikers. Kopylov is the smoother operator, landing precision power strikes. Rodrigues embodies his \"Robocop\" nickname, marching forward until he or his opponent short-circuits. Kopylov laid an egg against Paulo Costa this summer, so it'll be interesting to see how he bounces back on Saturday.\nHonorable mentions: Beneil Dariush vs. Benoit Saint-Denis, Bo Nickal vs. Rodolfo Vieira\n            ",

They have won nine games, eight of which were victories by one goal, including a streak of six consecutive one-goal wins. Both teams have a goal differential of -3. However, Dallas has a shot differential of -37, while Ottawa is at +27,\" SportsLine NHL expert Jeff Hochman said. \"Linus Ullmark will be in goal for the Senators, and he's 2-0 with a 1.46 GAA and .952 save percentage against Dallas over the last three seasons. With both teams playing their third game in four days, let's ride with the Senators at home.\" Back the Senators at FanDuel Sportsbook:Ohio money line vs. Western Michigan (+102)Both of these teams are in a four-way tie atop the MAC standings at 4-1 in conference play, but Ohio is the defending league champions and will be riding high coming off a crucial 24-20 win over Miami (OH), who is also 4-1. Sieh Bangura rushed for 102 yards and a touchdown while also catching three passes for 30 yards in the win and he's settled back in as one of the best backs in the MAC after leaving Ohio for one-season stint at Minnesota. Western Michigan's run defense has been boom or bust all season, so a lot rides on Bangura's ability to find traction. The model has the Bobcats winning in 72% of simulations. Back Ohio at FanDuel Sportsbook:UC Riverside +19.5 vs. New Mexico (-108)\"Mountain West sources are suggesting that the Lobos are a work in progress for new HC Eric Olen (via UCSD), who has an entirely new roster in Albuquerque and already giving a long look to various frosh, including top early scorers F Tomislav Buljan (via Croatia) and G Jake Hall. UNM is barely hitting 40% from the floor and 30% beyond the arc vs. limited opposition in two games,\" legendary college basketball handicapper Bruce Marshall said. \"Meanwhile, reports from the Big West indicate UCR could be a sleeper under new HC Gus Argenal, most recently a winner at CSUSB. Argenal obviously worked the portal hard for a collection of far-flung transfers such as G Marqui Worthy Jr (18.5 ppg; via UMass) & F Osiris Grady (18 ppg; via UVU).\" Back Dallas at FanDuel Sportsbook:\nWant more college football and basketball picks?You've seen some of the model's best bets for Tuesday.

He's scored at least 30 points in seven straight games, including 35 points against the Grizzlies on Sunday. The Thunder have the No. 5 scoring offense (122.4 ppg) and No. 1 scoring defense (108.8 ppg) to open the season. Stephen Curry is expected to return for the Warriors, but after missing three games with an illness, his endurance could be lacking, and the Warriors went 1-2 in his absence.

So far, so good. FSU topped 100 points in wins over Alcorn State and Alabama State playing at a frenetic pace. However, teams that play fast against Florida typically don't live to tell about it,\" SportsLine college basketball handicapper Thomas Casale said. \"Granted, the Gators lost to Arizona playing that style but the Wildcats have an elite roster. This is a tough spot for a new coach with an entirely new roster going on the road for the first time.\" Back Florida at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Under 174.5 points in Louisville vs. Kentucky (-105)Pat Kelsey and Mark Pope have quickly put their stamp on these two blue bloods from the Bluegrass State and Louisville and Kentucky have scored 105.0 points and 92.0 points per game, respectively, against lesser competition. However, while both teams are certainly capable of playing at a breakneck pace, expect Louisville in particular to pull back a little bit with Kentucky feeling slightly more comfortable in a track meet.

Oklahoma pulled off a road upset at Tennessee on Nov. 1 before having a bye last week, while Bama had a physical win over LSU on Saturday. One can't discount the rest advantage that provides the Sooners as Alabama has covered in just one of its last five games when it has a rest disadvantage. OU quarterback John Mateer is undefeated (3-0) on the road with Oklahoma and has 17 total touchdowns versus just two interceptions over his last six road games overall. The model forecasts Oklahoma to go into Tuscaloosa, Ala., and cover over 50% of the time. See the rest of the model's picks here.\nAnother prediction: No. 16 Miami (-14.5, 55.5) covers at home versus NC State on Saturday at 3:30 p.m. ET. Being at home is important to note for the Canes as NC State has lost both on the scoreboard and versus the spread in three straight road games. The Wolfpack's defense will be the weakest unit on the field come Saturday as it's allowed 41.7 points over its last three, while Miami's defense is the strength of its team. The Hurricanes rank 10th in FBS by allowing just 15 points per game, and of their last six home games, they've allowed a lone touchdown -- or no trips to the end zone at all -- in five of them. The model has Miami covering well over 50% of the time, with the Over hitting in well over 60% of simulations in an A-rated pick. See which other picks the model likes here.\nHow to make college football picks for Week 12The model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every FBS matchup in Week 12, and it's calling for multiple upsets in major games, including a pair of ranked teams outright losing to unranked foes. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine, and for a limited time you can use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1.So what college football picks can you make with confidence, and which ranked squads go down?

    "body": "\n        With just two teams on a bye, Week 11 Fantasy football lineups may look a little more robust after four squads had off last week. The likes of Ja'Marr Chase, Dak Prescott, Javonte Williams, Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce are back in action, but Kansas City receivers may not be too appealing as Week 11 Fantasy football picks. That's because the Chiefs are facing a Denver team which has allowed the fewest Fantasy points to wideouts.Observing which defenses are more conducive to allowing lots of points and yards should be a part of every manager's Fantasy football strategy. If the likes of Hollywood Brown, Rashee Rice and Xavier Worthy stay on your bench, then you'll want to see what the Week 11 Fantasy football projections forecast for others on your roster. Before making your Week 11 Fantasy football picks, be sure to check out the Week 11 Fantasy football rankings from the proven computer model at SportsLine. Bet on every NFL Week 11 game at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your $5 initial wager wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:When it comes to ranking players, SportsLine's model beat human experts in Fantasy football for the past several seasons, especially when there were big differences in ranking.

Brown, Jonathan Taylor, Derrick Henry, Christian McCaffrey, Alvin Kamara and Jahmyr Gibbs. Anybody who banked on players like those could have made a run at their league title.Now, the model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, has revealed its Fantasy football rankings for Week 11 of the 2025 NFL season. Head to SportsLine now to see them. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. Top Week 11 Fantasy football picks One surprise in Week 11: The model is fading Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, a 10-time Pro Bowler who ranks as the TE5 this year. Even though Kelce had the second-most positional Fantasy points from Weeks 5-9 before a bye last week, he has a matchup to avoid as the Chiefs face Denver, which ranks No. 3 in scoring defense and No. 6 in passing defense. Just six teams have allowed fewer receptions or receiving touchdowns to tight ends than the Broncos, who've held their last three opposing starting TEs -- including Brock Bowers -- to an average of 44.3 yards and zero scores. Kelce sits outside the top 10 Fantasy tight ends in the Week 11 Fantasy football rankings, so he's one to fade.Another curveball: The model is high on Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, despite being the QB17 entering Week 11 and coming off the worst Fantasy performance of his Pittsburgh career. Rodgers has an extremely favorable matchup versus Cincinnati on Sunday as he had a four-touchdown game versus the Bengals in Week 7. Cincinnati has allowed the second-most Fantasy points to quarterback in 2025, as it's given up the most passing touchdowns and third-most passing yards. The model has Rodgers ranked above the likes of Patrick Mahomes, Caleb Williams and Matthew Stafford, despite all three of them being among the top 10 Fantasy QBs this season.

    "body": "\n        Outside of the 2020 season impacted by COVID-19, this marks the first time since George W. Bush's presidency that Penn State and Michigan State are meeting with neither ranked. Unless, of course, you are using the Bottom 25 as your ranking of choice.The Nittany Lions and Spartans are each featured in this week's ordering of the sport's most wayward teams. Penn State, which has become a regular in these parts, nearly escaped the Bottom 25 in Week 11 while hosting No. 2 Indiana. However, the Nittany Lions suffered heartbreak once again, as they couldn't hold on to a late lead against the visiting Hoosiers in a 27-24 loss. We did reward Penn State for its valiant effort by moving it up seven spots.Michigan State fell into the Bottom 25 via attrition following its bye week after North Carolina and Clemson each vaulted out with big conference victories. Their wins opened up a spot for the Spartans, who are 0-6 in Big Ten play. Sparty's only victory against a Power Four opponent came on Sept. 6 in overtime against Boston College. Coming off a bye and with weary Penn State team coming to town this week, maybe that will finally change. Of course, even if Michigan State beats Penn State, it still won't have a win against Power Four team not ranked in the Bottom 25.\nThis year's Bottom 25 formula has been tweaked to ensure fair representation from across the sport. Each of the Power Four leagues gets an automatic bid to the Bottom 25 each week, and a total of 10 Power Four schools must be represented.Bottom 25 Rankings^ Joined Bottom 25 this weekOwned by KentuckyFlorida is selling itself on the coaching market as a program brimming with national championship potential that only a handful of other schools can match. But among the schools that claim to live in college football's ruling class, the Gators might have the lowest floor. Their 38-7 loss against a bad Kentucky team marked UK's largest victory over an SEC foe since 1998. It was also Florida's fourth loss to the Wildcats in the last five seasons. Can you imagine Alabama losing to Mississippi State four times in five years? That's the equivalent. The Gators are one loss away from finishing below .500 for the fourth time in five seasons.25. Stanford^24. Michigan State^23. Purdue (24)22. Florida^21. Syracuse (22)Deer seasonSpeaking of SEC teams with low floors, could Arkansas be headed toward its third two-win campaign of the past eight years? It certainly seems like it. The 2-7 Razorbacks are at LSU this week, at No. 10 Texas the following week and close with a home game against Missouri. The Hogs have been painfully close so many times this season. But it's a test of resolve at this point. How many times can a wounded team playing for an interim coach keep pulling itself up off the mat? There's a chance this squad gets its doors blown off down the stretch. At least its deer season.\n20. Colorado (21)19. Penn State (12)18. Arkansas (19)17. Kent State^16. Bowling Green (18)Respect the resultsHere at the Bottom 25, we do our best to respect head-to-head results (at least when it's convenient and the results are recent). Such is the justification for placing Sam Houston ahead of Oregon State this week. The Bearkats picked up their first win of the season over the Beavers in a 21-17 Bottom 25 thriller. Sam Houston rallied from a 17-0 deficit, despite totaling just eight first downs and 157 total yards for the entire game. The Beavers more than tripled Sam Houston in yards and first downs and still managed to lose. That takes a special level of ineptitude. 15. Louisiana-Monroe (17)14. Tulsa (14)13. South Alabama (11)12. Sam Houston (2)11. Oregon State (20)\nThese Eagles have no wingsYou know how they do the Directors' Cup, which recognizes athletic departments for their collective success across sports? If there was an inverse award given to the least successful department, BC would surely be in the mix. The men's basketball team hasn't been to an NCAA Tournament since 2009, women's basketball hasn't been since 2006 and football isn't much better. The Eagles are setting at 1-9 and haven't finished with a winning record in ACC play since 2009. Thank goodness for the men's hockey and women's lacrosse programs.10. UTEP (8)9. Colorado State (16)8. Northern Illinois (15)7. Boston College (7)6. Middle Tennessee (6)One winless team leftAnd then there was one! Sam Houston's inspiring and somewhat hilarious win over Oregon State (see above) leaves UMass as the only winless FBS team remaining. This is familiar territory for the Minutemen, who also started 0-9 in 2012 before beating Akron on Nov. 10 en route to a 1-11 finish. The bad news is that UMass just lost to Akron 44-10. This week's game against Northern Illinois, a Bottom 25 comrade, is likely the Minutemen's best chance to avoid 0-12.\n5. Nevada (10)4. Charlotte (5)3. Georgia State (4)2. Oklahoma State (3)1.

    "body": "\n        With a minute and a half left to play on Monday night, the Green Bay Packers had a chance to drive down for a potential game-winning touchdown against the Philadelphia Eagles. That didn't happen because they got stopped cold on a fourth-and-1 in an eventual 10-7 loss.The embarrassing part for the Packers? A big reason why they got stopped is because the Eagles knew Green Bay's play.The Packers had a fourth-and-1 on their own 44-yard line, and the call was a handoff to Josh Jacobs. Just before the snap, the Green Bay running back said that he heard a Philadelphia player literally call out the play.\"Fourth-and-1, they called out our play,\" Jacobs said.When you're facing a key fourth down like that, it helps to get creative, but that's not what the Packers did.\nMatt LaFleur called an inside zone run that the team had used several other times in the game, according to Jacobs.\"We ran it like four times,\" Jacobs said. \"They called it out. Got good drive, push. The clock was going down. We kind of snapped it fast -- faster than we wanted to -- and they made a play.\"It wasn't just Jacobs who heard the play being yelled out before the snap. During the game broadcast, you could literally hear Eagles defensive tackle Moro Ojomo yell out the play through your TV at home.\n\"I mean, they called it out,\" Jacobs said. \"We called our play. They said, 'Inside zone, coming right here.' So I kind of didn't want to run right there, you know? But yeah, that's just how it played out.\"\n\"Inside zone this way, inside zone this way,\" Ojomo said just before the snap.The Eagles were definitely ready for the play, and they proved it by stuffing Jacobs. Ojomo yelled out the play with about 28 seconds left on the play clock, so the Packers had the chance to audible to something else, but they chose to stick with the play that was called.If you're wondering how Jacobs felt about the fact that the Eagles knew what was coming, he was worried.\n\"As a runner, it don't ever feel good,\" Jacobs said. \"I mean, whenever they know what we're doing, it don't ever feel good because it changed my mind on how I'm going to run the ball, if we're being honest. It makes me kind of guess what I'm going to do.\"Obviously, people are smart. If we got code words or whatever, you hear it a few times, you're going to eventually react to it. I mean, that's football. But yeah, it's never a good feeling.\"By the time Jacobs took the carry, it was pretty clear that the play was going to fail. The Packers running back actually ended up losing 5 yards on the play because he fumbled the ball while trying to pitch it to Jordan Love.\n\"I tried to pitch the ball back to Jordan,\" Jacobs said. \"That's where the fumble came. But at that point, it's you playing backyard football -- it's fourth down.\"Jacobs ran for 74 yards and a touchdown on 21 carries for a Green Bay offense that struggled for the second straight week.With the 10-7 setback, this marks the first time since 1991 that the Packers held a team to 10 points at home and still lost. The Packers have lost consecutive games, including last week's 16-13 defeat against the Panthers in Week 9.\nThis skid marks the first time in 48 years that the Packers have lost two straight home games where they held their opponent to 17 points or fewer in each game. When your defense is playing that well, the offense takes the blame for the losses.One reason why the offense struggled against the Eagles is because Love didn't have two of his top three pass catchers: Tucker Kraft (ACL tear) is out for the season, and Matthew Golden missed the game due to a shoulder injury. Kraft led the team in receiving yards (489) entering Week 10 while Golden was third with 262.With the offense now in a rut, it might be time for LaFleur to reinvent himself. The unit is clearly having problems, and one of those seems to be that the Packers have just gotten too predictable.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The first week of the 2025-26 college basketball season is in the books. It's safe to say that the 2025 recruiting class is already living up to the preseason hype and shaping up to be an all-time class. Casual college basketball fans might have been familiar with the \"Big Three\" heading into the season. That would be Kansas' Darryn Peterson, BYU's AJ Dybantsa and Duke's Cameron Boozer. However, this class is much deeper than just those three studs. There are plenty of first-year players making their presence felt early and contributing to key wins already. Look no further than Arizona forward Koa Peat, who had the strongest debut of any first-year player in the sport. Peat was a dominant force inside for the Wildcats and helped his team pull off an upset win over reigning national champion Florida during the opening night of the season. Let's jump into our rankings and get to our CBS Sports/USBWA Freshman of the Week for the 2025-26 college basketball season. \n  Freshman of the Week: Koa Peat, Arizona Welcome back to the Frosh Watch, our weekly ranking of the ten most impressive freshmen in college basketball. For the 11th season in a row CBS Sports has once again teamed up with the United States Basketball Writers Association and its Wayman Tisdale Freshman of the Year Award to present this every-Tuesday feature. Each week, we'll start by announcing the national Freshman of the Week honoree. The cycle for FOTW runs Tuesday-Monday.  The No. 11-ranked player in the 2025 recruiting cycle by 247Sports is making a strong case to be in the best freshman conversation. Peat is part of a loaded recruiting class that Arizona coach Tommy Lloyd landed, which includes himself, five-star Brayden Burries, four-star Dwayne Aristode, and Bryce James, the son of NBA superstar LeBron James. \nPeat had the most impressive showing of almost any player in the country against Florida. Peat finished with 30 points, seven rebounds, three assists and three steals during a 93-87 upset win. What made Peat's performance even more impressive is that he was going up against arguably the best and deepest frontcourt in the nation. Peat outplayed the more experienced competition and had a performance to remember against the Gators. He also scored 18 points in 28 minutes against Utah Tech later in the week. \n Frosh Watch: Ranking top 10 freshmen \n    \n                                        \n     1. Darryn Peterson | G | Kansas Stats: 21.5 PPG | 3.5 RPG | 3.0 APG Peterson debuts at No. 1 in Frosh Watch. The Kansas star, in my opinion, should be the No. 1 pick in the 2026 NBA Draft. The way he can move with the ball in his hands and his shotmaking ability are second to none. Kansas can't generate enough offense without him on the floor. Peterson had a really tough matchup against UNC standout senior defender Seth Trimble last week. The Tar Heels sold out to make anyone else on Kansas' roster beat them, and to an extent, it worked. Peterson still finished with 22 points on 8 of 14 shooting in the 87-74 Jayhawk loss. \n\n    \n                                        \n     2. Cameron Boozer | F | Duke Stats: 20 PPG | 10.5 RPG | 3.5 APG Boozer is going to be able to wake up, get out of bed, drive to the arena and record a double-double. It's almost effortless for him. Even when he struggled in the first half of his collegiate debut against Texas, he still managed to finish with 15 points and 13 rebounds. All 15 of those points came after halftime, too. \nAgainst Western Carolina, Boozer had his best performance of the young season. He finished with 25 points, eight rebounds and five assists in just 23 minutes of action. Boozer is going to end up averaging a double-double this season. He brings it every night. \n\n    \n                                        \n     3. Caleb Wilson | F | North Carolina Stats: 22.0 PPG | 5.5 RPG | 3.5 APG Wilson was considered for Frosh of the Week after having two standout performances. Wilson scored 22 points and grabbed four rebounds in just 25 minutes against Western Carolina and followed it up with an even better showing against Kansas. Wilson finished with 24 points, seven rebounds, four steals and four assists in the win over the Jayhawks in Chapel Hill. What stood out to me is what Wilson did in those minutes. He was consistently hustling all over the floor, diving on the floor and playing tough defense. When your best player plays like he has something to prove, you have something special brewing. UNC hasn't had a lottery pick since 2019. That will change this summer. \n\n        \n            \n                Put Caleb Wilson among nation's top freshmen as well after UNC's win vs. Kansas in early blue-blood battle\n                \n                    Isaac Trotter                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n    \n                                        \n     4. Koa Peat | F | Arizona  Stats: 24.0 PPG | 5.0 RPG | 4.0 APG Peat was simply dominant against an experienced and talented Florida frontcourt. He was the best player on the floor against two players (Alex Condon and Thomas Haugh) who are potential All-American candidates. Peat's blend of size and strength makes him a matchup nightmare. He still isn't a threat as an outside shooter, but anything inside the 3-point line has a chance to go in. Peat should be a strong contender for Big 12 Freshman of the Year. \n        \n            \n                Tracking college basketball freshman debuts: Cameron Boozer, AJ Dybantsa impress, Koa Peat explodes\n                \n                    Cameron Salerno                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n    \n                                        \n     5. AJ Dybantsa | F | BYU Stats: 19.0 PPG | 7.0 RPG | 3.0 APG Dybantsa entered as the most hyped-up recruit in BYU program history. He had a strong showing (21 points, six rebounds and three assists) in a win over Villanova. \nAlthough he is ranked No. 5 in these initial rankings, Dybantsa has a strong case to move up into the top three. The big test will come against UConn this weekend in Boston, which will be a homecoming game for Dybantsa. \n    \n                                        \n     6. Nate Ament | F | Tennessee Stats: 20.5 PPG | 8.5 RPG | 3.0 APG Ament is the highest-ranked recruit in Tennessee program history. Tennessee coach Rick Barnes has had multiple key transfers over the years that have gone on to be productive players, but he hasn't had someone with the raw talent like Ament has. In his debut against Mercer, he finished with 18 points and nine rebounds. He followed it up by scoring 23 points in a blowout win over Northern Kentucky. What was impressive in particular about that game was that Ament was able to get to the free-throw line 10 times. \n\n    \n                                        \n     7. Darius Acuff Jr. | G | Arkansas Stats: 19.0 PPG | 2.0 RPG | 5.0 APG Arkansas coach John Calipari has done a phenomenal job producing guards at the college level who are immediately ready to play in the NBA. Acuff has the makings to be the next great point guard Calipari will coach. He is a true floor general who can do a little bit of everything. Acuff scored 22 points in his debut against Southern and finished with 16 points and six assists in front of a hostile environment at Michigan State. \n\n    \n                                        \n     8. Mikel Brown Jr. | G | Louisville Stats: 14.5 PPG | 4.0 RPG | 7.5 APG Brown didn't play much (18 minutes) during Louisville's opener against South Carolina State, but still finished with 11 points and six assists. Brown logged 26 minutes against Jackson State and finished with 18 points, nine assists and five rebounds. \nSomething to keep an eye on is turnovers. He had three in the opener and six in his second game. Brown has the potential to be the first true point guard taken in the draft this summer. \n\n    \n                                        \n     9. Neoklis Avdalas | G | Virginia Tech Stats: 20.5 PPG | 4.0 RPG | 7.5 APG If you haven't had the chance to watch Avdalas play, you should immediately. He was someone who flew under the radar heading into the season because of all the talent entering college basketball. However, Avdalas looks more than capable of working his way into the best freshman conversation. The Kalamata, Greece native is a 6-9 guard who can shoot, make plays and score. He knocked down five 3-pointers and finished with 33 points in a 107-101 win over Providence. \n\n    \n                                        \n     10. David Mirkovic | F | Illinois Stats: 18.0 PPG | 12.5 RPG | 2.5 APG Mirkovic had a strong opening week of the season for Illinois. The Niksic, Montenegro native finished with a double-double in both games, which included him going for 19 points and 14 rebounds during a 113-55 win over Jackson State. Illinois had a strong offseason by landing a handful of impact players from the international ranks. Mirkovic looks like a strong contender to win Big Ten Freshman of the Year. \n            ",

Solo Ball scored a game-high 23 points. Alex Karaban added 20. If you watched, you know the Huskies outscored Columbia 50-27 in the first half before coasting to the 27-point victory. UConn coach Dan Hurley didn't like his team's performance in much of the second half but seemed to understand what happened.\"I thought the first 22 [or] 25 minutes of the game were an extension of the last game,\" Hurley said in reference to the Huskies' 110-47 rout of UMass Lowell last Friday. \"I thought we showed a level of dominance and defense. Fifteen assists and two turnovers in the first half with suffocating defense. I thought it was awesome.\"Second half, human-nature kicked in.\"Yeah, it did. And It happens — even to the best, sometimes. Either way, the uninteresting part of UConn's schedule is now over. Next up is the good stuff —specifically Saturday's showdown with BYU in a matchup of the teams ranked third (BYU) and fourth (UConn) in Tuesday morning's updated CBS Sports Top 25 And 1 daily college basketball rankings, where Purdue remains No. 1 for the third consecutive day.\nThe UConn-BYU game will be played at TD Garden in Boston and serve as a homecoming for BYU freshman AJ Dybantsa, the 6-foot-8 wing who was born in Boston and raised in nearby Brockton, Massachusetts. Dybantsa is averaging 19.0 points, 7.0 rebounds and 3.0 assists through two games at BYU. He's on the short list of legitimate candidates to be the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NBA Draft.

Bet it at bet365 here:\nUnder 47.5 in Akron vs. Kent StateThese teams have been playing low-scoring games for more than a decade, as the Under has cashed in 10 of the last 15 head-to-head meetings, including six of the last seven hosted by Akron. Kent State is one of the worst offensive teams in college football, ranked fifth-worst among FBS teams in yards per game (271.8). Akron also sits near the bottom of the rankings with 339.3 yards per game, so the model is projecting just 44 points to help the Under cash in 59% of simulations. Bet Akron vs. Kent State at bet365 here:Ohio -1.5 vs. Western MichiganOhio and Western Michigan are two of four teams tied for first place atop the MAC standings, and the Bobcats are riding a three-game winning streak heading into this matchup. Two of their three losses this season came against Big Ten opponents, but they covered the spread in both of those contests. Western Michigan has lost four games this season, and Ohio is 11-4-1 against the spread in its last 16 games, so the model has the Bobcats covering the spread 71% of the time. Bet Ohio vs. Western Michigan at bet365 here:Louisville -3.5 vs. KentuckyOne of the biggest rivalries in college basketball is taking center stage on Tuesday night, and there is going to be an electric atmosphere.

Star Kasean Pryor returned for the first time since tearing his ACL in the Battle 4 Atlantis championship last November, and his return is one reason why the model has Louisville covering 61% of the time. Bet Louisville vs. Kentucky at bet365 here:\nLooking for Week 11 NFL picks?You've seen the model's best bets for Tuesday.

The Celtics got us Sunday in Orlando but still are only 2-4 ATS away. Concludes a three-game trip for them and is the front of a B2B (but not for Philly). The rivals have split two one-point games thus far, each winning on the road,\" SportsLine NBA handicapper Matt Severance said. \"Tyrese Maxey is averaging 28.3 points, 7.4 assists, and 4.6 rebounds in his past eight games against the Celtics, including four games with at least 30 points and five assists. Joel Embiid's minutes are ticking up slightly each game, although I doubt we ever see him play even 38 again short of the playoffs.

However, Marvin Menzies' squad was picked to move back into the middle of the pack this season while Iona chose to start fresh with Dan Geriot after Tobin Anderson struggled to take on Rick Pitino's mantle. The Gaels only have 7.3% of their scoring back from a season ago while the Roos return second-leading scorer Jayson Petty and added talented JUCO guards Karmello Branch and U'Riyah Evans.

Akron will host Kent State at 7:30 p.m. ET, and then Western Michigan hosts Ohio for an 8 p.m. ET start. According to the latest Week 12 college football odds, Akron is favored by 5.5 points at home, while the over/under is 46.5. Western Michigan is favored by 1.5 at home, while the over/under for that contest is also 46.5.Our computer model's top picks for Tuesday are Under 46.5 points and Zips -5.5 in Akron vs. Kent State, and Ohio money line (-108) in Western Michigan vs. Ohio.

Bet it now at Caesars Sportsbook: Akron -5.5 vs. Kent State (-112) The Zips have already matched their win total from last season after a dominant 44-10 win over UMass brought their record to 4-6. Now Joe Moorhead has a chance to take the program to a bowl game for the first time since 2017 with wins over Kent State and Bowling Green in the next two weeks. Joe Gant ran for 153 yards and two touchdowns in the win over the Minutemen and he now leads the conference in rushing yards (850).

UMass is arguably the worst team in college football and Akron hadn't previously scored more than 28 points against an FBS opponent while being held to 7 or fewer on four occasions. Kent State has also only scored more than 28 points in a game this season against UMass and was held to 13 points in a loss to Ball State last week.

That also means a steady supply of rumors, most of which center on free agency and trades (along with the occasional hiring and firing). Speaking of which, you can find Tuesday's supply just below. Tucker a possibility for Dodgers Will the top-rated free agent pair up with the top-rated team this offseason?\nKyle Tucker is available on the market, the Dodgers have a need at the outfielder corners, and they have the resources and competitive will to make it happen. As one of the best all-around players in baseball (when healthy), Tucker seems like an ideal fit in L.A. for 2026 and beyond. However, such a pairing is not to be assumed. The Dodgers have some impressive outfield prospects on the way, and as the Athletic reports they may be inclined to sign a veteran outfielder to a short-term deal to serve as a bridge to those incoming outfield prospects. Possibilities on that front include free agents Harrison Bader and Trent Grisham, or it's possible the Dodgers could revisit trade talks with the Guardians regarding Steven Kwan. Contreras may stick with St. LouisThe Cardinals, in the midst of pivoting toward some level of mid- to long-term rebuild, are likely to explore trade opportunities for the veterans remaining on their roster. The wrinkle is that those three veterans -- third baseman Nolan Arenado, right-hander Sonny Gray, and first baseman/catcher Willson Contreras -- all have no-trade clauses. Arenado is certainly willing to waive his for the right fit and Gray has indicated a willingness to do the same, albeit for perhaps a narrower band of destinations. As for Contreras, he's repeatedly said he wants to remain in St. Louis as he heads into the third year of a five-year, $87.5 million pact. \nAt the end of the 2025 season, he reiterated those desires to new lead decision-maker Chaim Bloom, and the Belleville News-Democrat reports that Contreras still seems inclined to stick with St. Louis. Coming off another productive season, Contreras would probably have a market for his services, especially if he's willing to take on part-time catching duties, but for now he still seems like he wants to remain a Cardinal despite what seem like long odds of contention in 2026. \n            \n    ",

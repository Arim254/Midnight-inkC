After conceding the opening goal to the home side and a difficult first half in Norway, American international Weston McKennie put the Bianconeri ahead with their second goal following Lois Openda's equalizer.Just when the match seemed on Luciano Spalletti's side, Juventus conceded a late penalty that Sondre Fet converted for the Norwegians. But in stoppage time, Jonathan David delivered the decisive goal, finishing a rebound off an extraordinary solo run by Kenan Yıldız to secure the win. McKennie, on the other hand, finally scored his first goal of the 2025-26 season, grabbing a well-placed header in this Champions League clash.The American international took advantage of a wonderful assist made by Italian midfielder Fabio Miretti, restoring Juventus' lead on a difficult pitch as the Bianconeri faced Bodo/Glimt amid challenging weather conditions. Let's take a look at the goal scored by McKennie: \nThis is the eighth goal scored by McKennie in the Champions League, after the one scored when he was playing for Schalke 04 during the 2018-19 season, before the six scored at Juventus in four Champions League campaigns played at the Italian club. Strangely enough, it was the first goal of the season for the USMNT midfielder, who has been heavily affected by Juventus' challenging start that ultimately led to Igor Tudor's dismissal and the appointment of Spalletti as the new head coach.\nTuesday's win against Bodo/Glimt is a crucial step for the team coached by Spalletti as the Bianconeri were still looking for their first Champions League win of the season after three draws against Borussia Dortmund, Villarreal, Sporting CP and one defeat at the Santiago Bernabeu against Real Madrid. Juventus are still in the middle of the standings, hoping to end up in the top 16 and to play the playoffs in February before the knockout stages but the victory in Norway becomes a turning point ahead of their European run. Despite the managerial change, Juventus are still struggling and only won two of the five games since Spalletti was hired. It's still early in the season, but signs of improvement are emerging for Juventus, who remain firmly in the race in both Serie A and the Champions League.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Oklahoma State is hiring North Texas coach Eric Morris as the man to replace for Mike Gundy in Stillwater, the school announced Tuesday.Morris has gone 21-15 in his three seasons in Denton, with the Mean Green enjoying their best season in years in 2025, going 10-1 so far with a legitimate shot at the College Football Playoff. Morris is expected to finish out the season with North Texas, including coaching the American title game and a potential College Football Playoff visit if the Mean Green finish as the top Group of Five team in the country. Oklahoma State is hoping Morris can lead a turnaround for one of the worst Power Four teams in the country this season. The Pokes are one of two Power Four teams that is without a win against FBS competition this year (along with Boston College) and are 1-10 going into their regular season finale. Morris replaces school legend Mike Gundy, who was fired earlier this year. One of his primary tasks will be modernizing how Oklahoma State operates in the NIL space and transfer portal after the program lagged behind in both areas under Gundy.\"Today begins the next era of Oklahoma State Football,\" Oklahoma State athletic director Chad Weiberg said in a statement released by the school. \"I am thrilled to introduce Eric Morris, his wife Maggie and their boys Jack and George to the OSU Family. Coach Morris has proven his ability to build and lead winning football programs. He has consistently identified, recruited, and developed some of the best players in college football.\"\nMorris' track record with quarterbacks in particular makes him an appealing hire for the Cowboys. He was Texas Tech's offensive coordinator during Patrick Mahomes' time in Lubbock, and he coached Cam Ward at Incarnate Word before bringing him to Washington State for the 2022 season.This year, Morris has overseen another breakout star in Drew Mestemaker. The redshirt freshman leads all FBS quarterbacks with 3,469 passing yards, 26 touchdowns and just four interceptions. Oklahoma State fans will hope Mestemaker follows Morris from Denton to Stillwater and immediately upgrades the Cowboys' quarterback room.North Texas boasts one of the best offenses in the country. They lead the nation in points per drive (3.88) and yards per play (7.4) and are third in the nation in success rate (55.1%). Oklahoma State, by comparison, averages just 1.02 points per drive, 4.6 yards per play and has a 37.6% success rate on offense this season. \nRecent seasons have shown hiring a top Group of Five coach can spark a quick turnaround -- especially if that coach brings key players with him. Curt Cignetti's move from James Madison to Indiana is the clearest example, as several Dukes followed him to Bloomington. Given North Texas' success this season, particularly on offense, Oklahoma State could lean on a similar blueprint with Morris and allow him to hit the ground running with a core that already knows his system.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Anthony Davis is No. 2 on the Fanspo NBA trade machine's list of trending players, but I do not recommend trying to come up with realistic deals for him. It is a frustrating exercise, and there's a decent chance it will bum you out.In theory, Davis' situation should be simple: He's turning 33 in March, and the Dallas Mavericks aren't set up to succeed on his timeline. Both sides would be better off with a trade that sends him to a win-now team in exchange for a package of younger players and draft picks.Every expert agrees, though, that the Mavericks can't expect anybody to give up all that much for Davis. It doesn't matter that he was the centerpiece of the Luka Dončić trade less than 10 months ago, and it doesn't matter that he made Second Team All-NBA 17 months ago. \"There's not a lot of teams that are lining up\" to acquire Davis, ESPN's Tim Bontemps said on Monday's episode of the Hoop Collective. In the immediate aftermath of the Nico Harrison firing, The Ringer's Zach Lowe said that the difference between what the Mavs gave up for Davis and what they'll eventually get for him \"will set the world record for the biggest delta in trade returns for one single player in the history of professional sports.\"The big issue is not that Davis arrived at training camp well above his normal playing weight. It's not that he strained his calf a week into the regular season, either. It's his contract.\nDavis is making $54.1 million this season, is owed $58.5 million next season and has a $62.8 million player option in 2027-28, the season in which he will turn 35. Next August, he'll be eligible to sign an extension that would pay him as much as $275 million over four years and as much as $76 million in 2030-31, the season in which he will turn 38.The first hurdle is finding a team that is mechanically capable of putting a trade package together. That front office not only needs to believe it's a Brow away from championship contention; it needs to believe it's a Brow away from championship contention even after taking into account the loss of the players it is trading away. Those players' 2025-26 salaries must total at least $43.1 million, and that team's post-trade payroll cannot exceed the first apron.The second hurdle is finding a team that isn't scared of what it will have to pay Davis down the road. It doesn't necessarily have to be willing to offer him a four-year max extension next summer, but it must be confident that it can extend him on a more team-friendly deal or be comfortable with Davis either hitting free agency in 2027 or picking up his 2027-28 option. Negotiating with future Hall of Famers in their mid-30s can be difficult.\nAnd these obstacles are just about one side of the equation. Let's say Davis returns to face his old buddies in Los Angeles on Friday, plays at an All-NBA level for the next few weeks and motivates a few teams to try to trade for him. Will these hypothetical suitors be willing to -- or even have the ability to -- trade multiple first-round picks for him? If not, will the Mavericks be interested in the young players that are on the table? It's easy to say that the Mavs \"should\" trade Davis, but I have yet to see a fake trade involving him that seems both plausible and a no-brainer for them. It is not clear what bar must be cleared for them to find an offer acceptable.If all of this sounds familiar, it's because it's essentially the same story that we've seen with a number of stars under the NBA's latest collective bargaining agreement. There was not a robust trade market for Jimmy Butler, and the Miami Heat ended up accepting a package of Andrew Wiggins, Davion Mitchell, Kyle Anderson, a 2025 first-round pick (that landed at No. 20 and turned into Kasparas Jakučionis) in exchange for Butler, Josh Richardson and two second-round picks. The Phoenix Suns traded Kevin Durant for a fraction of what they'd given up to get him. The trade that ended Brandon Ingram's tenure with the New Orleans Pelicans wasn't strictly a salary dump -- they got a protected first-round pick out of it -- but it felt a lot like a salary dump, didn't it?In Jake Fischer's latest newsletter at The Stein Line, he writes that the Charlotte Hornets aren't interested in moving LaMelo Ball in part because they are \"unlikely to get the sort of offers for Ball they'd be hoping for,\" which he describes as \"somewhat reminiscent of the situation Anthony Davis faces in Dallas.\" He also writes that the Sacramento Kings are \"unlikely to bring back a significant haul\" for Domantas Sabonis, Zach LaVine or DeMar DeRozan. All of these players are former All-Stars, and it's not as if the whole league has decided they're bad. DeRozan is the only one making less than $38 million this season, though, and, in this landscape, acquiring any of them is complicated.\nGenerally speaking, good teams are not looking for complicated. They don't want to blow up what's working, reorient everything in the middle of the season or set themselves up to be in salary-cap hell a couple of years from now. As trade season approaches -- it unofficially begins on Dec. 15, the day that most players who signed new contracts last summer will be eligible to be traded -- big names like Davis are bound to get the most attention, but they're not the ones who will have the most suitors.If you're a buyer, your ideal target is probably a younger player who complements your core players on both ends, can defend multiple positions, doesn't need tons of touches and is on a relatively cheap contract. This is why the only player ahead of Davis on the Fanspo's NBA trade machine's trending list is a fourth-year guard who is making $2.3 million this season: the Kings' Keon Ellis. According to The Stein Line, more than half the league has called about him.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Thanksgiving week in MLB rumors isn't usually a big one, but moves can happen. In fact, the Red Sox acquired Sonny Gray from the Cardinals in a trade this morning. Maybe we'll see another big move or two. You never know. In the meantime, let's round up all the rumors for the day right here. Imai prefers to 'take down' DodgersDon't expect incoming Japanese right-hander Tatsuya Imai to join the Los Angeles Dodgers now that he's been posted by his NPB team, the Saitama Seibu Lions, for MLB consideration. Rather, Imai said during an interview with former MLB/NPB pitcher Daisuke Matsuzaka that he cherishes the idea of beating the Dodgers and their collection of Japanese stars -- Shohei Ohtani, Yoshinobu Yamamoto, and Roki Sasaki.\"Of course, I'd enjoy playing alongside Ohtani, Yamamoto, and Sasaki,\" Imai said, according to MLB.com, \"but winning against a team like that and becoming a world champion would be the most valuable thing in my life. If anything, I'd rather take them down.\"\nImai, 27, would probably find it in his heart to change priorities if the Dodgers made the best offer. Still, it's a fun wrinkle in his free agency. Imai is considered one of the better starting pitchers on the market after a NPB send-off season that saw him post a 1.92 ERA and a 3.96 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 24 outings. CBS Sports ranked him as the 12th-best player on the market.D-backs 'actively listening' on All-StarThe Diamondbacks have had issues with second baseman Ketel Marte, notably late last season when some teammates were reportedly frustrated with him for he took some time off after his home was burglarized. Around the same time, Marte's name started to pop up in trade rumors. That's still apparently the case, as the \"Diamondbacks are actively listening,\" according to MLB Network. \nMarte, 32, made the All-Star team for the third time this past season and won his second Silver Slugger. In 126 games, he hit .283/.376/.517 (145 OPS+) with 28 doubles, 28 homers, 72 RBI, 87 runs and 4.4 WAR. He'd fit nicely on just about any team, as long as they could make room at second base. He's locked up through 2030 on a relatively club-friendly deal that'll pay him $15 million next season.Red Sox, Realmuto connectionThough a new catcher hasn't been said to be high on the Red Sox's list of priorities this offseason, they've shown interest in free-agent catcher J.T. Realmuto, per The Athletic, which added:\nThe usual caveats apply. It is early in free agency. Teams are touching base with a large number of players. The best guess with Realmuto is that he will still re-sign with the Philadelphia Phillies, his team since 2019.In 134 games last season, Realmuto hit .257/.315/.384 (91 OPS+) with 12 homers, 52 RBI, 57 runs and 2.5 WAR. We won't likely see him come close to returning to the 6.5-WAR season he posted in 2022, but he's still a quality backstop, even headed into his age-35 season. As things stand, the Red Sox catchers are Carlos Narváez and Connor Wong.Marlins, Stowers far apart on extension talksThe Marlins and All-Star outfielder Kyle Stowers talked extension earlier this offseason, but there was no traction due to the two sides being very far apart, according to The Athletic. In fact, it sounds like the Marlins were offering about half of what Stowers' agents were asking. Stowers' side was reportedly looking at Bryan Reynolds' extension (eight years and $106.5 million) as a guide in asking for around $100 million. The Marlins were instead looking at the Cedanne Rafaela deal of eight years and $50 million. By my count, that's a $50 million differenceStowers, 27, had a breakout season in 2025. He hit .288/.368/.544 (149 OPS+) with 25 home runs, 73 RBI and 3.6 WAR in 117 games.\n15 teams on Helsley, who could convert to SPFormer Cardinals closer Ryan Helsley, who disappointed for the Mets after being traded there last season, has upwards of 15 teams with interest in him as he weighs trying to convert to a starting pitcher, reports The Athletic. Mike Axisa of CBS Sports examined Helsley along with two other possible reliever conversions this morning.Helsley, 31, was one of the best closers in baseball in 2024. He was good with the Cardinals before the trade last season. With the Mets, he posted a 7.20 ERA and 1.80 WHIP in 22 appearances. He's never started an MLB game and has appeared 297 times in relief, pitching to a career 2.96 ERA with 377 strikeouts in 319 ⅔ innings.\n            ",

And I'm stepping forward today because we cannot wait any longer to realize a Bahamas that we all envision is possible.\"Fox, 56, was raised in the Bahamas before transferring to a high school in Indiana to further his basketball career. He played college basketball at the University of North Carolina before being drafted 24th overall by the Boston Celtics in the 1991 NBA Draft. Fox spent six seasons with the Celtics before signing with the Los Angeles Lakers as a free agent in 1997. Over seven seasons with the Lakers, Fox was a member of three championship teams before retiring in 2004 after 13 years in the league.\nAfter retiring he turned to acting, and has been involved in several business ventures. Now, he's trying his hand at a political career.\"As a candidate and as a leader for the Bahamas I will demand transparency, honesty, integrity while demanding a level of excellence from all of us,\" Fox wrote. \"This is bigger than party politics. This is the Bahamas versus the world. Imagine a nation where every Bahamian feels secure, safe, empowered, and proud. Where opportunity flows, innovation thrives, and our people shape the world from home.\"\nThough he lives in Los Angeles, Fox has a residence in the Bahamas. He's also been an ambassador since 2022 for the country, where he assists in the development of sports.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Matt Norlander is on the Vegas Strip and bouncing back and forth between the two arenas hosting this year's Players Era Championship. He'll be providing frequent updates and insider information throughout each day of the event, so check back in regularly. This is his Monday notebook.LAS VEGAS — The Players Era Championship has caused more conversation, buzz, criticism and intrigue than anything else so far this season.Some of that is because it's got some obvious flaws. Let's address the biggest one right now. On Tuesday, No. 15 Iowa State beat Creighton with aplomb, 78-60. The Cyclones are 2-0 in the event after winning a riveting battle over No. 14 St. John's on Monday.\nBut in the immediate hours after this win, they have no idea when they'll play on Wednesday nor who their opponent will be. That's because Players Era's 18-team format isn't built upon a bracket. When you don't have bracket play AND you don't have all matchups predetermined, you're left to rely on game scores to settle the rest of the schedule. The primary tiebreaker is average margin of victory (with a cap of 20 points to avoid incentivizing teams heedlessly running up the score). Iowa State's average margin of victory after two games is 9.5. Will that be enough to put the Cyclones in Wednesday's championship game — where the winning team will be awarded $500,000? We don't know yet.We do know it's already behind 2-0 Kansas, which has a 10.5 MOV after beating Notre Dame and Syracuse by a combined 21 points.\nThe event's abnormal format isn't lost on some fans who flew out here to take in hoops on the Strip. As final seconds died out Tuesday, an Iowa State backer sitting in Section 220 was shouting to ISU's Milan Momcilovic, \"YOU NEED TO MAX IT! SHOOT IT!\" He knew one more basket could be the difference between playing for first place or playing in the third-place game. Momcilovic opted not to shoot.I did a walk-and-talk with Cyclones coach TJ Otzelberger after the win to chat about the unusual (and criticized) tiebreaker scenarios in play. The situation on Tuesday was muddled all the more by the fact that Otzelberger says he owes his career to Creighton coach Greg McDermott, who gave him his first break in 2006 by bringing him on staff at Iowa State (when McDermott was in his first season coaching that program).\"Going into it, you know that point deferential is a part of this,\" Otzelberger told CBS Sports. \"The respect I have for Coach McDermott and his program, we're not going to put the game in position where we're trying to run up the score and get extra points late to win by a greater margin. To me, the relationship and the character of our program is more important than that. The easy solution would have been if we would have been up by [20], then it would have been fine, but that wasn't the case. We want to do the right thing.\"\n\n        \n            \n                College basketball rankings: Players Era needs a bracket, not complicated tiebreakers to determine finalists\n                \n                    Gary Parrish                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nPlayers Era's margin-of-victory rule has made it vulnerable to easy criticism. And that noise has also overshadowed a more important element of the entire experience: winning games. Players are already getting paid to play in this event, so the tiebreaker is really about who gets a chance at the most money. But, as Otzelberger told me, the more valuable thing for his team is the Quad 1 wins for the taking.\"You're here to win games, you're here to get better as a team and a program,\" Otzelberger said. \"The main thing is to come out and give it your best to win the game. And I understand there's other factors and variables that go into this event, but we're just gonna focus on being at our best to come out win the game.\" By the way, ISU won without starting point guard Tamin Lipsey, who sat due to a sore groin. His availability for Wednesday is questionable, Otzelberger said. \nThe Cyclones are off to their first 6-0 start since 2021-22 and averaging a sizzling 90.5 points. It's looking like a top-10 team in the country.Will it be enough to play for the championship on Wednesday? Sit tight. There could be as many as five 2-0 teams battling for two spots in the championship game. I'll update this story throughout the night with the latest as we learn more here in Vegas. I'll also have quotes from the events founders, who will answer questions about why they created this format as opposed to doing a 16-team bracket in this year's event.2025 Players Era scores, scheduleMonday's scoresNo. 17 Tennessee 85, Rutgers 60RecapBaylor 81, Creighton 74 RecapKansas 71, Notre Dame 61RecapNo. 15 Iowa State 83, No. 14 St. John's 82RecapNo. 3 Houston 78, Syracuse 74 (OT)RecapNo. 21 Auburn 84, Oregon 73RecapNo. 12 Gonzaga 95, No. 8 Alabama 85RecapNo. 7 Michigan 94, San Diego State 54RecapMaryland 74, UNLV 67 RecapTuesday's scores, scheduleNotre Dame 68, Rutgers 63 RecapNo. 15 Iowa State 78, Creighton 60RecapKansas 71, Syracuse 60RecapNo. 14 St. John's vs. Baylor4:30 p.m. (truTV) at Michelob Ultra ArenaNo. 3 Houston vs. No. 17 Tennessee6 p.m. (TNT) at Grand Garden ArenaNo. 7 Michigan vs. No. 21 Auburn8:30 p.m. (TNT) at Michelob Ultra ArenaNo. 13 Gonzaga vs. Maryland9:30 p.m. (truTV) at Grand Garden ArenaOregon vs. San Diego State11 p.m. (TNT) at Michelob Ultra ArenaUNLV vs. No. 8 Alabama12 a.m. (truTV) at Grand Garden ArenaWednesday's schedulePremiere Four (Field determined after Tuesday's games)Third-place game7 p.m. (TNT) at Grand Garden ArenaChampionship9:30 p.m. (TNT) at Grand Garden ArenaConsolation games, TBDThursday's scheduleConsolation games, TBD  \n            ",

Keisean Nixon got in a limited practice after not practicing at all on Monday, a good sign for his potential availability.None of Graham Glasgow, Kerby Joseph, Kalif Raymond or Brock Wright practiced for the second consecutive day. It seems unlikely they'll play. (Dan Campbell all but confirmed that Joseph, at least, will sit.)

Campbell expressed optimism that Marcus Davenport could return on Thursday.Kansas City Chiefs at Dallas Cowboys (+3)Running back Isiah Pacheco is set to make his return for Kansas City and has been a full participant so far this week.

Rashee Rice, Xavier Worthy and Leo Chenal were upgraded to full practices on Tuesday.\nGeorge Pickens returned to a limited practice on Tuesday after sitting out with knee and calf designations on Monday. KaVontae Turpin and Osa Odighizuwa were similarly limited after being DNPs for the first session of the week.

The Lions remain one game back of the Bears (yes, really) for first place in the NFC North, and they'll also have revenge on their minds for this game, as the Packers destroyed them back in Week 1. The game is part of a tough three-week stretch for the Lions, who play the Cowboys and Rams in the two games following this one.Green Bay also captured a win last week, improving to 7-3-1 with a comfortable victory over the Vikings. Green Bay has won back-to-back games since being somewhat embarrassed in games against the Panthers and Eagles a few weeks ago, and will surely be looking to lay the hammer down on the Lions here and knock them even further back in the division race. The Packers have their own chance to stake claim to the division down the stretch, with games against Detroit and Minnesota and two against Chicago.Will the Packers make it three wins in a row, or will the Lions finally stack back-to-back victories for the first time since early October? We'll find out soon enough. But before we break down the matchup, here's a look at how you can watch the game.\nWhere to watch Lions vs. Packers liveDate: Thursday, Nov. 27 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: Ford Field (Detroit)TV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free) Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Lions -2.5, O/U 48.5 via DraftKings SportsbookBet Packers vs. Lions and other NFL Week 13 games at DraftKings, where new users who win a $5 wager get $300 in bonus bets and three free months of NBA League Pass.\n        \n            \n                Super Bowl or bust: Biggest reason why these 11 contenders will miss out on hoisting the Lombardi Trophy\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nKey storylinesRevenge game. The Packers absolutely destroyed the Lions back in Week 1. Their defensive front totally dominated the game to the point that the Lions were essentially unable to function offensively. Micah Parsons played a limited role after sitting out for most of the offseason program prior to his trade to Green Bay, but he was phenomenal in his limited snaps. Players like Lukas Van Ness, Devonte Wyatt and more showed out, and the secondary was extremely sticky in coverage throughout the game. The Lions will surely want to prove that the game was an aberration, and they have shown throughout this season that they can still be as explosive as any team in the league when they are on their game.NFC North standings. Chicago has surged into first place in the division on the strength of a four-game winning streak, but both Green Bay and Detroit are right behind the Bears. Chicago sits at 8-3, but the Packers are 7-3-1 and the Lions are 7-4. The Packers currently own the tiebreaker over the Lions thanks to their head-to-head victory, but Detroit can even that up with a win. The Lions also own the head-to-head tiebreaker with the Bears, and don't play them again until the final week of the season. The Packers have yet to play against Chicago, and have two games coming up against the Bears in Weeks 14 and 16. This round robin of games will go a long way toward determining the NFC North champion.Injuries galore. Both teams are incredibly banged up coming into this game, with a spate of injuries affecting each team. Both teams will be without their star tight end, as Tucker Kraft and Sam LaPorta remain on injured reserve. And then on Monday's injury report, an incredible 31 players were listed. That includes Packers No. 1 cornerback Keisean Nixon, pass-rusher Lukas Van Ness and interior defensive lineman Karl Brooks, along with Lions center Graham Glasgow and safety Kerby Joseph, none of whom practiced in any capacity. (Joseph is not expected to play, per Dan Campbell.) The Packers could get back one or both of Josh Jacobs and Jayden Reed, who each got in limited sessions on Monday, as did Matthew Golden. Marcus Davenport, meanwhile, could return for Detroit, but the Lions limited a whole bunch of other players (including most of their offensive line, along with Brian Branch and Terrion Arnold) on Monday as well. Thanksgiving history. This will be the 23rd all-time meeting between the Lions and Packers on Thanksgiving, the most such matchups in NFL history. (They played every year from 1951 through 1963.) The Lions are 12-9-1 in the Thanksgiving day series against Green Bay despite being just 38-45-2 all time. This will be Green Bay's 39th time playing on Thanksgiving overall, and the Packers are 16-20-2 in those contests. The last time these two teams played on Thanksgiving was actually two years ago, with the Packers winning 29-22.Prediction\nDetroit is a different team on the fast track at Ford Field than it is outdoors. That game back in Week 1 was a long time ago, and it was played at Lambeau Field. The Lions simply have more explosive playmakers on offense than do the Packers, and I therefore trust them to put up more points -- even against this Green Bay defense. \nPrediction: Lions 27, Packers 20\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Joe Burrow is expected to make his return to the field this Thanksgiving when his Cincinnati Bengals travel to take on Lamar Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens. Burrow suffered a Grade 3 turf toe injury back in Week 2 that required surgery, but he returned to practice two weeks ago and will return to help Cincinnati dig out of a 3-8 hole.There are plenty of people out there questioning Burrow's decision. The franchise quarterback has a history of injuries but is returning to the field for a team that is considered a significant longshot to reach the postseason (+2500 at FanDuel). But Burrow doesn't see it that way. His job is to play football, and if he gets hurt, his job is to rehab and get back to playing football.\"I understand why people feel that way, but if you look at it from my perspective, I'm a football player and if I get hurt, I'm going to go through the rehab process and then I'm going to let everybody know when I feel like I can go out there and play,\" Burrow said, via CBS Sports' John Breech. \"I don't really know what else to say about that. I'm not ever going to go to somebody and say, 'Yeah, I'm healthy, but I don't think I should go out there and play.' That doesn't make a lot of sense to me. \"I'm not going to live my life and play this game scared of something happening. Like, yeah, something is going to happen, it's football. Guys are going to get hurt, guys are going to get concussions, you're going to break bones, tear ligaments, it's a physical, intense game. That's part of this. Yeah, I've had injuries, there's not a lot I can do about that. I worked really hard to have that not happen, but what I can do is when it does happen, I can control how I'm attacking my rehab and attacking practice and doing everything in my power to get back as quickly as possible and that's what I did.\"\n\n        \n            \n                Joe Burrow injury update: Bengals coach anticipates star QB playing on Thanksgiving vs. Ravens\n                \n                    Bryan DeArdo                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBurrow completed 58.3% of his passes for 189 yards and two touchdowns before going down with his toe injury. It was unfortunate, as Burrow had a magnificent season in 2024, leading the NFL in both passing yards (4,918) and passing touchdowns (43) while winning Comeback Player of the Year for the second time in his career. When Burrow went down, Jake Browning took over as the Bengals' starting quarterback. However, after a disastrous 0-3 stretch, Cincinnati was forced to consider other options. In the first week of October, the Bengals sent a fifth-round pick to the rival Cleveland Browns for Joe Flacco and a sixth-round pick. While Flacco did jump-start the offense, the fact of the matter is he's 1-5 as the starter, and the Bengals have lost four straight. \nIt may be too little too late for the Bengals, but Burrow is going to suit up if he's able. \n            ",

This year, we've added a column for those of you who play in four-point-per-pass TD leagues, and a column for half-PPR leagues! Yes finally.                      The values assigned to the players below reflect a long-term measurement of their Fantasy value. Values are determined by expected future performance, future schedule, and, most importantly, public sentiment. Past performance isn't a major factor in the Trade Chart.                      By adding two players' values, you could determine what one player you should be able to get in return. However, Fantasy managers should take off 10% of the value in any trade where one side has two or more players than the other. Also, a handful of others only carry legitimate value in two-QB or full-PPR leagues (and thus have no value listed in one-QB or non-PPR leagues).                     \nThis list also works as a \"rest of season\" rankings for the 2025 season.                      Finally, any player not on the chart should be considered valued at no more than four points. If you want to dive deeper before sending out or replying to trade offers, be sure to find my updated projected rest of season schedule rankings available on SportsLine later this week.                          \nYou can reach out with any questions, disagreements, or reports of trades from your leagues to Dave Richard at drichard@cbs.com or at @daverichard on X.

Only five power jobs came open all of last season, when 30 total jobs (25 in the Group of Six) were filled.  Overall, the two years leading up to this cycle (2025-26) were the most hectic we've seen this century, with a total of 61 programs changing head coaches. That means an incredible 44.9% of FBS teams changed leadership during a two-year span. That number will skyrocket this fall and winter.  \nCBS Sports is tracking every move in the 2025-26 cycle and grading each hire below.

But can Franklin win some big games? He's 4-21 against top 10 teams, including a 15-game losing streak against AP top six teams.

Situated on one of college football's hottest seats  entering his sixth season at the program, Pittman finishes 32-34 overall at Arkansas, including a 14-29 mark against SEC competition. Since finishing 9-4 overall and finding a spot inside the final AP Top 25 poll to conclude the 2021 season, the Razorbacks sputtered under Pittman's guidance despite a bevy of coaching staff changes and roster alterations annually in recruiting and through the transfer portal.         \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    James FranklinPenn State fired Franklin      six games into his 12th season with the Nittany Lions -- amid a disastrous three-game slide. The No. 2 team in the preseason AP Top 25 just two months ago, the Nittany Lions slipped to 0-3 in Big Ten play following a stunning 22-21 home loss to Northwestern in Week 7 -- a game in which they were a three-touchdown favorite.

    "body": "\nThe 2025 NFL season moves to Week 13, which brings about three Thanksgiving games, a Black Friday contest, 11 Sunday affairs, a Monday night showdown featuring two teams who have met in the Super Bowl twice and, surprisingly, no teams on a bye. While division matchups like the Detroit Lions taking on the Green Bay Packers and the Cincinnati Bengals battling the Baltimore Ravens will get the most attention, bettors might want to look elsewhere when building their best NFL money line parlays.If you're looking to get into parlay betting and NFL betting for Week 13, you need to see what SportsLine expert Jeff Hochman has to say. He's put together two money line parlays for Week 13, with one featuring only favorites on the money line and the other featuring only underdogs.Week 13 NFL money line favorites parlay\nBetting heavy favorites can be a solid strategy if you want to bet on a three-team NFL money line parlay. This approach focuses on teams with odds of -150 or better, which means you lean towards high-probability outcomes. By pairing three teams that usually have odds between -150 and -350 or even higher, you're not only aiming for consistent, modest returns, but you're also stacking the deck in your favor for a higher chance of winning. Remember that you can still parlay a favorite with odds of -140 or less to avoid laying 2.5 points, which can significantly impact your chances of winning. Remember, you have to win all three legs for a successful wager.According to BetMGM data, NFL money line favorites at -115 or shorter posted a 68% win percentage in 2023, with a 66.5% rate in 2022. Over the six-season period from 2018-24, NFL money line favorites maintained a 66.6% win rate (1,013-508-7). The strength of favorites correlates directly with their odds. In sports betting, if you see teams with odds between -150 and -200, they generally have a solid chance of winning, with around a 60-65% success rate. Teams that are even bigger favorites, with odds from -250 to -400, tend to be more reliable, showing win rates of about 70% to 80%. The 2024 NFL season stood out for favorites, with an overall win rate hitting 71.8%.In Week 12, NFL betting chalk had another solid performance going 10-4. NFL betting favorites have won 124 out of 177 games in the first 11 weeks of the 2025 season, achieving an overall success rate of 70.0%. This figure continues to creep up to last year's mark of 71.8%. What does this mean for Week 13? Will the dogs bark as they usually do in Week 13. Take a look at Jeff's top money line parlays featuring favorites and underdogs.Buffalo Bills over Pittsburgh Steelers\nAaron Rodgers is expected to play after missing last week with a fractured left wrist, though he practiced in a limited capacity. While Mike Tomlin stated they have \"great optimism\" regarding his availability, a broken left wrist to Rodgers' throwing hand introduces a tangible accuracy risk, particularly on throws requiring full wrist extension (vertical throws, sideline throws). I want to fade the aging Rodgers as the season progresses.Buffalo is ranked first in pass defense in the NFL, allowing just 168.2 yards per game, a statistical outlier that reflects both tactical design and personnel, and sixth in opponent passer rating (84.2). The Bills have allowed only 12 passing touchdowns through 11 games, ranking among the league's most efficient coverage units. I don't see any wide receivers on the Steelers' roster that intimidate me. On the flip side, Pittsburgh is ranked 31st, allowing 258.7 receiving yards per game. The Bills should have a lot of success through the air, which will open up their run game even more with James Cook (1,084 yards and seven rushing TDs) leading the charge.Josh Allen is 4-1 straight-up against the Pittsburgh Steelers in his career, including 31-17 as 10-point home chalk in last year's playoffs. He's been \"money\" after a loss, going 80-35. You know what to do.Seattle Seahawks over Minnesota Vikings\nI will keep this brief: The Seahawks rank first overall in DVOA (Defense-Adjusted Value Over Average), placing them among the most efficient NFL teams in the past 50 years. According to DVOA research, only three teams since 1978 have performed better through eight games than Seattle's current pace -- the 2007 Patriots, 1991 Redskins, and 1985 Bears -- all of which reached the Super Bowl. Seattle's offensive DVOA ranks fourth and defensive DVOA also ranks fourth. The combination is elite.In contrast, the Vikings' offense has been inconsistent and their defense has deteriorated significantly. The Vikings are 4-6 and have lost five of their last six games, with their offense failing to score 20 points in four of those six losses. The Vikings' trajectory in this matchup is decidedly downward. It's so bad in Minnesota right now the Vikings have seen enough of J.J. McCarthy (concussion?) and could turn to Max Brosmer, an undrafted rookie, for his first NFL start. Mike Macdonald scheming against a rookie QB making his first career start on the road will not end well for the Vikings.Los Angeles Chargers over Las Vegas Raiders\nFresh off a bye, the Chargers should be refueled and revitalized for the stretch run. Yes, they have suffered numerous injuries on their offensive line but I'm trusting head coach John Harbaugh to have a solid game plan with two weeks to prepare. I also love their defense against a struggling Raiders offense that averages just 4.6 yards per play (30th).The Chargers' defense ranks fifth overall in total yards allowed (286.1 per game) and fourth in passing yards allowed (172.3 per game). They rank fifth in third-down defense (35.4%) and sixth in red zone defense (52.8% TD rate), indicating elite efficiency across situational football. This is a top-10 defense operating at high efficiency, and the Chargers' coaching staff is smart enough to know to double-team Brock Bowers.The Raiders organization is in complete disarray entering this game, having fired offensive coordinator Chip Kelly on Nov. 23. This decision followed a disappointing 24-10 loss to the Cleveland Browns, which dropped Vegas' record to 2-9. Head coach Pete Carroll could be let go at the end of the season. I will be shocked if the Chargers don't win this game by at least a touchdown.Week 13 NFL money line underdogs parlay\nA popular option is available if you're willing to take on a bit more risk for a potentially higher reward. Underdog money line parlays offer the largest possible payouts in the NFL betting landscape. Combining three underdogs with odds like +200, +150, and +300 could result in payouts exceeding 20-to-1 or higher. The best part is that, due to the high payouts, underdog parlays can still be profitable even when winning only a small percentage of bets. For example, hitting just one of several large underdog parlays could offset multiple losses and generate overall profit. NFL underdogs have historically outperformed expectations in specific situations, with home underdogs of +2 to +3 winning outright 46-48% of the time.Cleveland Browns over San Francisco 49ers\nI don't think the 49ers have the better QB right now. Brock Purdy still looks rusty (three interceptions on MNF) and will play his first cold-weather game in possibly wet conditions. Shedeur Sanders' historic first start -- becoming the first Browns QB since 1999 to win his inaugural game -- creates psychological momentum favoring another start. Sanders completed 11 of 20 passes for 209 yards, with a touchdown and an interception. More importantly, he demonstrated elite efficiency on explosive plays, with a 19% explosive pass rate, second only to Dillon Gabriel's Week 7 performance this season. Against a 49ers defense susceptible on third downs, Sanders' ability to extend plays through scrambling and find big plays becomes increasingly valuable. Cleveland's offense looked more energized than at any point this season.The 49ers will be playing at 10 a.m. (body clock) on a short week. The weather forecast looks wet and cold, which the home team is more accustomed to playing in. Cleveland's defense ranks among the league's most fearsome pass-rushing units. Myles Garrett leads the NFL in quarterback pressures, and the Browns' secondary features elite cornerbacks Denzel Ward and Martin Emerson Jr. The Browns rank third in sack percentage (10.31%) and third overall in defensive pressure, creating problems for any quarterback. The 49ers have not had their bye week yet, which means they will play 13 consecutive weeks. I really like the Browns on the money line in this spot.Tennessee Titans over Jacksonville Jaguars\nTennessee has covered the spread in three consecutive games despite losing all three contests. This trend of covering reveals a Titans team that has become competitive in close-game situations. Home environments historically amplify this tendency. When you see a team covering spreads in three consecutive games, it's a sign victory is on the horizon. The Titans have a good chance to win outright against a Jacksonville team that owns a +1.5 point differential along with a -0.2 net yards per play. The Titans look much more competent since Brian Callahan's termination, which has coincided with Cam Ward's improvement with each game.Trevor Lawrence has proven to be an inconsistent quarterback who struggles with ball security. In his most recent outing against Arizona, he threw for 256 yards with three touchdowns but also had three interceptions -- a dangerous ratio for an offense expected to dominate a bottom-tier defense. His season-long EPA per play of -0.04 ranks him among the least efficient qualified passers in the league. More concerning for Jags fans, Lawrence has exhibited turnover-prone tendencies throughout the season, creating opportunities for defensive exploitation that Tennessee can capitalize on.The Titans lost both games against Jacksonville in 2024 by deficits of four and seven points, despite having a significantly weaker QB room. I will gladly back the home divisional dog at +250 on the money line in this spot.New York Giants over New England Patriots\nThe stage is set for one of the biggest upsets in MNF history. While the Patriots enter Week 13 with an NFL-best 10-2 record and riding a nine-game winning streak, the 2-10 Giants possess a perfect storm of advantages that could shock the football world at Gillette Stadium.The most intriguing factor favoring a Giants upset is the catastrophic injury situation facing New England's offensive line. The Patriots lost both starting left tackle Will Campbell and left guard Jared Wilson in their Week 12 victory over Cincinnati, leaving the entire left side of their protection scheme in shambles. This marks the most significant disruption to New England's offensive line all season, as their starting five had played together in 11 of 12 games. Most NFL games are won in the trenches, and the Giants have a slight edge now. Jaxson Dart is expected to return and his mobility can exploit this Patriots' defense.New England's nine-game winning streak looks impressive at first glance, but there's more to the story than meets the eye. Digging a little deeper, you'll find some cracks in the armor. Of the 10 wins, six have been by just a single possession. Three of those have come in the last four games. The Patriots recently eked out a 26-20 win against Cincinnati, where they found themselves down 10-0 early on and only pulled through thanks to a defensive touchdown. We know the Giants have a long history of upsetting the Patriots. I expect this money line to drop as the week progresses, so bet it ASAP.\n            ",

With that in mind, here are three backs we have been starting that I would like to get away from in Week 13.D'Andre Swift is probably the most obvious answer when you are looking for a Week 13 sit. He is still RB19 on a per-game basis but last week was a disaster and the trend hasn't been great since he returned from injury. In the past four weeks, Swift has had only one game with more than 13 carries and one with more than 2 targets. While his 44.6% snap share in Week 13 was a low mark, he has only topped 60% once since Week 4. This is a true committee, and I wouldn't be that surprised if Kyle Monangai gets the first crack at it this week.Dan Campbell loves David Montgomery, but Montgomery's Fantasy managers can't love the running back's usage since Campbell started calling plays. Montgomery only has 15 total touches in his last two games combined and has been below a 40% snap share in three of the Lions last four games. He hasn't scored a touchdown since Week 9 and only has one since Week 5. The last time they played the Packers he had 11 carries for 25 yards. Quinshon Judkins is also a sit for me, at least in full PPR leagues. The Browns offense is still horrendous and I do not expect they will be able to commit to the run like they did last week against the hapless Raiders. Judkins hasn't caught a pass in the past two games and has only topped 60 rushing yards once in his last three games. Now let's get to the rest of the Week 13 RB Preview:\n\n        Week 13 RB Preview\n    \n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    RB Preview\n                \n                            \n                    Numbers to know\n                \n                    \n            21 -- TreVeyon Henderson had 21 touches in Rhamondre Stevenson's first game back. We didn't get the results we wanted but you should go right back to Henderson this week.61.3% -- Before their bye, RJ Harvey played 61.3% of Denver's offensive snaps in Week 11. If he holds on to that role, I would expect him to be a top 20 back most weeks.3.86 -- Woody Marks has been the lead back for the Texans for three straight weeks, unfortunately, he has averaged a paltry 3.86 yards per touch in those three games.44.4% -- Before Isiah Pacheco's injury Kareem Hunt's season high snap rate was 44.4%. The last three weeks, he has played at least 70% of the offensive snaps. We expect Pacheco back on Thanksgiving.6 -- Javonte Williams only has six catches in his last five games combined. He's still an RB2, but not a must-start if you can do better.4 -- Breece Hall caught four passes in Week 12, only the fourth time he's done that all year. If Tyrod consistently throws the ball to Hall, he could be a borderline top-12 back for the rest of the season.32.4% -- Jaylen Warren only ran a route on 32.4% of Pittsburgh's dropbacks last week. Kenneth Gainwell had a 52.9% route participation.3.44 -- The Seahakws are holding running backs to a league-best 3.44 yards per carry. It coudl be tough sledding for Aaron Jones and Jordan Mason.\n    \n    \n                            \n                    RB Preview\n                \n                            \n

but this is a blowup spot for De'Von Achane. The Dolphins are favorite at home against the Saints and you should expect 20-plus touches for Achane. He has 55 touches in his last two games, both wins. In full PPR he is my number one running back this week.\n            \n            \nContrarian DFS Play\n                        Projections powered by\n                        \n                            Sportsline\n                        \n                    \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        LAR\n                    \n                         \n                        L.A.

There is a chance every week that he scores two touchdowns, even if Davante Adams has been stealing those red zone looks so far this year.

That is fantastic. Five of them are must-starts: Trey McBride, Travis Kelce, Brock Bowers, George Kittle, and Tyler Warren. In our consensus tight end rankings, all three of our rankers have all five of those tight ends ranked in the top five. After that, well, you could almost flip a coin. Well, there is some agreement between Jamey and Dave. They both have Juwan Johnson at TE6 and Brenton Strange at TE7. As of Tuesday afternoon, I have Johnson at 11 and Strange at TE13. Let's talk about why.Johnson is TE13 per game for the season with an average of 10.79 PPR FPPG. That bumps up to 13 points per game in four games with Tyler Shough. A big part of the reason that Johnson is producing better with Shough is that he has scored two of his three touchdowns in those four games. This week, the Saints have an implied total of 18.5, so it is hard to give any one player a large touchdown projection. The one thing Johnson has going in his favor is that the Dolphins have given up the sixth-most Fantasy points per game. As the week goes on, I could see Johnson rising into the top 10 for me, probably not up to six.Strange had a very encouraging return from injury last week with five catches for 93 yards. This week, he faces a Titans defense that has given up the eighth fewest Fantasy points to opposing tight ends. One thing that does concern me is that Strange has been at five or fewer targets in three of his five healthy games. And I am not sure that will change with Jacksonville leaning into the run like they have since the bye. That is particularly worrisome if the Titans offense doesn't keep this game competitive.\nTo be clear, I am not anti-starting Johnson or Strange. I would start them over Dallas Goedert, Mark Andrews, Zach Ertz, and many others. But there are really only five must-start tight ends this week, and they are not a part of that group.Here's everything else you need to know about tight end in Week 13:\n\n        Week 13 TE Preview\n    \n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    TE Preview\n                \n                            \n                    Numbers to Know\n                \n                    \n            33.3% -- Harold Fannin had a season-high 33.3% target share in Shedeur Sanders' first start. The team's pass volume will be higher this week, and I am still starting Fannin.22 -- The Bengals are giving up 22 Fantasy points per game to tight ends, by far the most. It could be another Mark Andrews week...or a sneaky Isaiah Likely week.28% -- In the two games Kirk Cousins has started, Kyle Pitts has a 28% target share. I am starting him again as long as Drake London is out.10.4 -- Oronde Gadsden has scored 10.4 PPR Fantasy points in his last two games combined. This will be a big week to see if he can turn back into a must-start tight end.40 -- Cade Otton has 40 or fewer yards in three of his last four games. If Teddy Bridgewater is the QB, you should probably sit Otton.26.6 -- Dallas Goedert is averaging 26.6 yards per game in his last five games.

That gives you the opportunity to play Brock Bowers at a lower roster rate. I am hoping that Bowers sees more usage with Chip Kelly gone, and at the very least Geno Smith won't be quite as uncomfortable as he was last week against the Browns. As disappointing as he has been, Bowers is still averaging 17.6 FPPG in his five healthy games.\n            \n            \n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    TE Preview\n                \n                            \n                    Heath's Projections\n                \n                    \n            My full set of Week 13 Fantasy football projections for every position is now available on SportsLine.

Gray struggled to a 4.28 ERA and 1.23 WHIP last season, but his underlying metrics were more indicative of a top-of-rotation arm, including a 26.7% strikeout rate, 3.39 FIP and 3.29 SIERA. The 36-year-old has seen his velocity decline in consecutive seasons, however, and his quality of contact metrics took a big step back in 2025, which is why his xERA was a more pedestrian 3.90 mark. He's a solid pitcher, both for the Red Sox and for Fantasy, but I don't think he's a needle-mover in either instance at this point in his career, even if the Red Sox might be able to get him in their pitching lab and squeeze some extra value out of him. There's still room for the Red Sox to upgrade this rotation, in other words.    Richard Fitts and Brandon Clarke traded to the Cardinals  In exchange for Gray, the Cardinals got a couple of interesting younger arms. Fitts is more of a known quantity, and he hasn't given us much reason to be excited – he had a 5.00 ERA with even worse peripherals in 2025, so while he might slide into the Cardinals rotation, it'll mostly be for a lack of better options.   \nClarke is the more interesting long-term project, with a fastball that can touch 100 mph and a slider that is already a weapon. The rest of the arsenal is a work in progress and he walked 27 in just 38 innings across two levels of A-Ball in 2025, so this is a real project. If all comes together, he might be able to hack it as a starter, but he looks more like a Ryan Helsley-in-waiting type of high-leverage bullpen arm in the long run.  The other thing worth noting here is that, with Gray out of the picture and Miles Mikolas leaving via free agency, there are multiple holes in the Cardinals rotation right now. Prospects Quinn Mathews and Tink Hence have experience in the high minors and could be options for the 2026 rotation, though both have troublesome 2025 campaigns that could lead the team to want to see more success at Triple-A before they make that call. For Fantasy, those are both names to know heading into Spring Training in case they can steal rotation spots, while 2025 first-round pick Liam Doyle seems likely to be more of a mid-season consideration after he threw just 3.2 post-draft innings in the pros. But he could absolutely be a fast riser early in 2026, too.      Marcus Semien traded for Brandon Nimmo   \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        NYM\n                    \n                         \n                        N.Y.

Nimmo, who's 32, has shown only faint signs of decline, if even those, continuing to make worthwhile contributions in home runs and stolen bases with big run and RBI production. He's joining a worse lineup that plays in a worse venue, but any changes to his production would be slight, presuming good health.   \n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        TEX\n                    \n                         \n                        Texas\n                    \n                                            • #2\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 35\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AVG\n                                    \n                                    .230\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        HR\n                                    \n                                    15\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RBI\n                                    \n                                    62\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        R\n                                    \n                                    62\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SB\n                                    \n                                    11\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AB\n                                    \n                                    470\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nSemien, who's 35, has seen his production nosedive the past two years, but this trade may serve to slow or even reverse the decline given the park upgrade. Statcast estimates he'd have a dozen more home runs during that same two-year span if he had played every game at Citi Field. That's my biggest takeaway from this trade, but Chris Towers has written a complete breakdown of it, which you can find here. --Scott White      \tRaisel Iglesias signs with Braves   \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        ATL\n                    \n                         \n                        Atlanta\n                    \n                                            • #26\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 35\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SV\n                                    \n                                    29\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        ERA\n                                    \n                                    3.21\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        WHIP\n                                    \n                                    1.00\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INN\n                                    \n                                    67.1\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        BB\n                                    \n                                    16\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        K\n                                    \n                                    73\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nIglesias re-ups for one year at exactly the same rate ($16 million) as the previous three. Clearly, the Braves were looking for continuity, and that makes the analysis here rather easy. He's the closer again for an expected contender and a near lock for 30 saves, provided he stays healthy. He missed that number by one in 2025, mostly because of some early-season struggles. Once he cut back on his slider, though, he was clearly back to form, compiling a 1.25 ERA, 0.69 WHIP and 10.0 K/9 in his final 45 appearances. That'll play, all right, and positions Iglesias to be one of the first 12 relievers off the board in 2026. --Scott White       \tGrayson Rodriguez traded for Taylor Ward    \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        LAA\n                    \n                         \n                        L.A.

Now, the Orioles have dealt him away for one year of some 32-year-old outfielder who just hit .228. That's not entirely fair to Ward, who also connected for 36 home runs in 2025, but most projections have him regressing to 25-30 in 2026. He's also joining a team that's loaded with solid-but-less-than-All-Star-worthy corner bats. There already wasn't room in the lineup for all of Dylan Beavers, Samuel Basallo, Coby Mayo, Tyler O'Neill and Ryan Mountcastle. Now, there's room for one fewer. It won't be Ward, but does that mean we'll have to wait even longer for Basallo to contribute in Fantasy? If so, that's a bummer.    \n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        BAL\n                    \n                         \n                        Baltimore\n                    \n                                            • #30\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 26\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2024 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        W-L\n                                    \n                                    13-4\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        ERA\n                                    \n                                    3.86\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        WHIP\n                                    \n                                    1.24\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INN\n                                    \n                                    116.2\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        BB\n                                    \n                                    36\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        K\n                                    \n                                    130\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nBut the real story here is Rodriguez, who Angels GM Perry Minasian says is expected to be ready for spring training after missing all of 2025 with lat and elbow issues. The lat has been a recurring problem, also costing Rodriguez time in 2024 and as a minor leaguer in 2022, and the elbow required debridement surgery in August. The Orioles only made this deal because they couldn't trust him to stay healthy, but having said that, he wouldn't be the first pitcher to overcome a multi-year injury trend and still go on to meet his potential. We have no evidence that his stuff has diminished with this latest rash of injuries, so I'm still inclined to rank him as a top 75 starting pitcher for 2026. This trade is sure to give some drafters pause even at that late stage, though.  --Scott White        \tTrent Grisham signs with Yankees    Grisham's decision to accept the qualifying offer is a curious one given that he just had far and away his best season, homering 34 times as the primary center fielder for the Yankees. Some major outlets were projecting him to receive a four- or five-year deal for a similar annual value as the qualifying offer, but his agent probably has a better read on the market.    \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        NYY\n                    \n                         \n                        N.Y.

You might think the return to Yankee Stadium will help, given that he's a left-handed batter, but he actually hit two-thirds of his home runs on the road. If the Yankees are serious about giving Jasson Dominguez regular playing time next year and also bringing back Cody Bellinger, Grisham may be fighting for at-bats again. The Yankees still make for a better landing than a lot of clubs, but you can understand why drafters might approach Grisham with some skepticism in 2026. --Scott White    \n    \tGleyber Torres signs with Tigers    \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        DET\n                    \n                         \n                        Detroit\n                    \n                                            • #25\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 28\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AVG\n                                    \n                                    .256\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        HR\n                                    \n                                    16\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RBI\n                                    \n                                    74\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        R\n                                    \n                                    79\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        OPS\n                                    \n                                    .745\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AB\n                                    \n                                    532\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nA modest showing by Torres in 2025 led him to accept the Tigers' qualifying offer rather than testing the free agent market, and you might think a return to Comerica Park is a bad move for his Fantasy value given its reputation. But it actually played well for right-handed hitters in 2025, and Torres batted .285 with a .449 slugging percentage there compared to .223 and .327 on the road. On balance, he performed well below his .271 xBA and .452 xSLG, having delivered his best average exit velocity in three years and some of his best walk and strikeout numbers ever, so some better luck would go a long way toward redeeming him in Fantasy. He's not a surefire top-12 choice, though, even at a position as thin as second base. --Scott White        \tBrandon Woodruff signs with Brewers    \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        MIL\n                    \n                         \n                        Milwaukee\n                    \n                                            • #53\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 32\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        W-L\n                                    \n                                    7-2\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        ERA\n                                    \n                                    3.20\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        WHIP\n                                    \n                                    0.91\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INN\n                                    \n                                    64.2\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        BB\n                                    \n                                    14\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        K\n                                    \n                                    83\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nSomething tells me that if Woodruff hadn't gone into the offseason nursing a lat injury, he wouldn't have had to accept the Brewers' qualifying offer, instead pursuing a multi-year deal. But now, he's back in prove-it mode after already overcoming a more significant shoulder injury in near miraculous fashion. Even though the shoulder capsule surgery that he underwent in 2023 took 3 mph off his fastball -- normally a career-ender for a pitcher, particularly one so fastball-reliant -- he basically picked up where he left off statistically, even delivering the best strikeout rate of his career. A new cutter is largely to credit for saving him, and his fortunes rose and fell with its usage. He'll be plenty motivated now that he's pitching for a contract again, but he would have been worth selecting among the top 36 starting pitchers either way.  --Scott White         \tShota Imanaga signs with Cubs     The Cubs' decision to decline Imanaga's three-year, $57.5 million option after the season makes more sense now that we see the way everything played out.

It's sort of misleading to call it his sophomore season given that he's 32, and his age contributed to those fears of decline as well. Still, he was effective when healthy, remaining a standout for WHIP in particular. No one will mistake him for an ace in 2026, but he should be drafted in the middle rounds. --Scott White               \tJosh Naylor signs with Mariners    Normally, a hitter signing with the Mariners wouldn't be the most favorable outcome given T-Mobile Park's reputation as a pitcher-friendly venue. But Naylor didn't have any problems there after coming over in a midseason trade with the Diamondbacks, batting .360 (32 for 89) with five homers and a 1.015 OPS in the Mariners' home games.    \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        SEA\n                    \n                         \n                        Seattle\n                    \n                                            • #12\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 28\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AVG\n                                    \n                                    .295\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        HR\n                                    \n                                    20\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RBI\n                                    \n                                    92\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        R\n                                    \n                                    81\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SB\n                                    \n                                    30\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        OPS\n                                    \n                                    .816\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nMoreover, the Mariners seemed to unlock the base-stealer in him. His 11 stolen bases in 93 games with the Diamondbacks were surprising enough, but then he had 19 in just 54 games with the Mariners. Given his 3rd percentile sprint speed, some other team might have put a stop to that, but the Mariners don't seem to care. He was succeeding, after all. It's doubtful he steals 30 again, which is why he remains only eighth in my first base rankings, but a return to the Mariners improves Naylor's chances of remaining a base-stealer in some capacity.

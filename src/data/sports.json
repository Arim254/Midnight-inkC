LSU (7-5) enters in off a 17-13 loss to Oklahoma and will be coached by interim, Frank Wilson, after hiring Lane Kiffin last month. Houston (9-3) is coming off a 31-24 victory over Baylor, and the 2025 Texas Bowl will take place 10 miles from its campus. The Tigers just defeated Baylor in last year's Texas Bowl, while this is the Cougars' first bowl of any kind since 2022.

The Tigers lead the all-time series, 2-1. The Cougars are 1.5-point favorites in the latest Houston vs. LSU odds from DraftKings Sportsbook, while the over/under for total points is 41.5.

    "body": "\n        Week 17 is the championship matchup in a vast majority of Fantasy football leagues, so it's the biggest week for Fantasy lineup decisions of the year for those who have made it thus far. In 2024, the players who had starred all year also showed up in the penultimate week as Joe Burrow, Saquon Barkley, Derrick Henry and Trey McBride were among the stats leaders. This year, it's the likes of Josh Allen, Jonathan Taylor and Puka Nacua who have excelled and remain must-starts as Week 17 Fantasy football picks.As for your Fantasy football start/sit decisions, targeting players on teams with something to play for that are facing teams out of playoff contention could be the way to go. So, the likes of Jaylen Warren, Baker Mayfield, Bucky Irving and Stefon Diggs may find themselves a bit higher in the Week 17 Fantasy football projections than expected. Some NFL injuries of note to consider for Fantasy include Lamar Jackson (doubtful, back) and Jordan Love (out concussion/shoulder) on Saturday.Before setting your Week 17 Fantasy football lineups for championship matchups, be sure to check out the Week 17 Fantasy football rankings from the proven computer model at SportsLine. Bet on every NFL Week 17 game at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your $5 initial wager wins:When it comes to ranking players, SportsLine's model beat human experts in Fantasy football for the past several seasons, especially when there were big differences in ranking.

Thomas, who is owned in almost all leagues being started in nearly half of them, has been a top-25 Fantasy receiver over the last three weeks, but this has been his best stretch all season as inconsistency has defined his sophomore year. He had a season-low of 18 yards last week, as both Parker Washington and Jakobi Meyers have passed Thomas in the eyes of Trevor Lawrence, as those two are averaging more receptions and yards over the last month. Thomas may not warrant a spot in Week 17 Fantasy football lineups as he sits outside the top 30 in wide receiver rankings.Another curveball: The model is high on Rams tight end Colby Parkinson, despite him being the TE22 on the season and being started in just 38% of leagues this week. Parkinson has quietly performed as the TE6 since Week 10 as he's made the most of Tyler Higbee going on injured reserve. The former has six touchdowns over his last seven games while averaging 35.9 receiving yards over this stretch. He should continue that success on Monday night versus a Falcons defense which just allowed 11 catches and 118 yards to the tight end position on Sunday, which came a week after giving up a tight end touchdown.

Stroud. Houston has the league's top defense, ranking first in both points allowed and yards allowed, and it's a defense that Justin Herbert knows all too well. In the Jan. 2025 playoff game between these teams, Houston picked off Herbert four times, which is one more pick than Herbert had in the entire 2024 regular season. Speaking of turnovers, the Texans have committed an NFL-low of five giveaways during their 10-2 run over their last dozen games, and they're on pace to be the first team in 17 years to not allow 250 passing yards in a game. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Chargers can coverWhile the Texans have lost multiple games ATS during their winning streak, the same can't be said about L.A. which has covered in all four games of its four-game win streak. The Chargers have clinched a playoff spot, but they still has a huge incentive in front of them as they can get the No. 1 seed, and a bye, if they win out. Meanwhile, Los Angeles' defense has actually performed better than Houston's over the last two months as L.A. has given up a league-low of 254.5 total yards over the last eight games. The Chargers also have a big historical edge in regard to the spread, going 7-3 versus the line over their 10 all-time meetings. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Texans vs. Chargers picksSportsLine's model has simulated Chargers vs. Texans 10,000 times and is going Over on the total. It also says one side of the spread is the better value. You can only get the pick at SportsLine. So who wins Texans vs. Chargers, and which side of the spread is the better value?

    "body": "\n        Michigan State coach Tom Izzo expressed more concern about college basketball's future following Baylor landing former 2023 NBA Draft pick James Nnaji. It represents an unprecedented move after his multiple professional years in Europe. Nnaji, who never signed an NBA contract, most recently played with Yukatel Merkezefendi in Turkey on loan from Spain's FC Barcelona. He averaged 7.5 and 4.0 rebounds with Yukatel Merkezefendi. Nnaji and Barcelona mutually agreed to part ways after the 2024-25 season before he played with the Knicks in the 2025 Summer League.Now, Baylor and coach Scott Drew get an immediately eligible 21-year-old 7-footer to help fill the frontcourt void left by injuries to Juslin Bodo Bodo (arm) and Maikcol Perez (ACL).\"Now we're taking guys that were drafted in the NBA and everything?,\" Izzo said. \"I said it to you a month and a half ago – c'mon Magic (Johnson) and Gary (Harris), let's go baby, let's do it. Why not? I mean, if that's what we're going to, shame on the NCAA. Shame on the coaches, too. But shame on the NCAA, because coaches are gonna do what they gotta do, I guess. But the NCAA is the one. Those people on those committees that are making those decisions to allow something so ridiculous and not think of the kid.\"So everybody talks about me thinking of my program or I'm selfish. No. Get that straight, for all of you. I'm thinking of, what is best for my son if he was in that position? And I just don't agree with it.\"\nIzzo said he would like to \"poll 360 coaches\" and see how many agreed with this ruling in favor of Baylor. Izzo previously ripped transfer portal culture in August.\"Write this one down: It's gonna get me,\" Izzo said. \"I'm just not gonna let it bother me. But it's gonna get me sooner or later. Sooner or later, it's gonna get me. Not that I'm too stubborn not to ever do anything.\"Izzo later directed his criticism toward NCAA president Charlie Baker, though he didn't mention him by name.\n\"What we've done in the NCAA has been an absolute travesty to me,\" Izzo said. \"We're just worried about getting sued and we're not gonna fight anybody. And I think leadership means you fight and you make decisions that are sometimes unpopular.\"\n            ",

The Packers, with some help from their division rival Minnesota Vikings on Christmas, clinched a playoff berth when the Detroit Lions were eliminated. Meanwhile, the Ravens need a win simply to stay in the running.The Packers (9-5-1) blew yet another late lead in an eventual 22-16 overtime loss to the Chicago Bears in Week 16, and making matters worse, starting quarterback Jordan Love left early with a concussion and will not play Saturday night. However, the Packers should take comfort in having Malik Willis under center. He performed admirably last week after taking over for Love (9-for-11 passing, 121 yards, one touchdown; 44 rushing yards) and has done so in the past as well.The Ravens also blew a late lead in a 28-24 loss to the New England Patriots, a game Lamar Jackson exited in the second quarter with a back injury and did not return. Jackson, who has dealt with a bevy of injuries this season, has also been ruled out. Baltimore will once again turn the keys over to Tyler Huntley. Huntley went 9-for-10 for 65 yards relieving Jackson and also won his lone start this season, back in Week 8 against the Bears.\nBelow, you'll find information on how to watch this game, plus betting information, keys to the game and a prediction.Where to watch Packers vs. Ravens liveDate: Saturday, Dec. 27 | Time: 8 p.m. ETLocation: Lambeau Field -- Green Bay, WisconsinStream: PeacockFollow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Packers -4.5, O/U 40.5 (via DraftKings)\nPackers vs. Ravens: Need to knowPlayoff significance for both. The Packers are looking at an uphill battle to win the NFC North, but they are at least in the tournament. The Ravens, on the other hand, have to win their final two games of the season and have the Pittsburgh Steelers lose both of their final two games. The Steelers face the Cleveland Browns on Sunday before hosting the Ravens in Week 18.Can Derrick Henry deliver? It's been a down season for Henry. After 2,114 yards from scrimmage last year, he has 1,403 this season -- still a huge number, but not close to his 2024 totals. Furthermore, Henry has had three lost fumbles, all in one-possession losses. Last week, the Ravens scored on their opening drive and were driving again when Henry coughed up the ball. The Packers can have some struggles against physical run games, though, and there's no one better to lead that charge than Henry.Packers defense must bounce back. In Week 15 against the Denver Broncos, the Packers gave up 391 yard, at the time their most allowed since Week 4. Then last week, they allowed 400 yards against the Bears. The Broncos threw for 302 yards; the Bears ran for 150. Without Micah Parsons, Devonte Wyatt and others, Green Bay has taken a step back in both facets.Packers vs. Ravens prediction, pickThe Ravens have their backs against the wall. The Packers are in and have the NFC North title still in their sights. The Packers are simply the better team -- more talented, more disciplined -- and if the teams have to go to their backups, Willis has played at a higher level than Huntley.\nPick: Packers 23, Ravens 17 | (Green Bay -4.5, Under 40.5)\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        The Las Vegas Raiders officially ruled out defensive end Maxx Crosby for Sunday's game against the New York Giants due to a knee injury and later placed the star pass rusher on injured reserve, ending his 2025-26 season. That announcement comes on the heels of reports that Crosby left the team facility after receiving the news from the team that he wouldn't play, a decision he \"vehemently\" disagreed with, according to Fox.\nWhen first-year Raiders coach Pete Carroll addressed reporters Friday, he said Crosby will not play in Week 17 and has been dealing with a nagging knee injury since the Kansas City Chiefs game in Week 7. He also acknowledged that Crosby was understandably frustrated with the team's decision to withhold him from playing, so Carroll excused him from the building.\"We talked when he was getting out of here that he's been fighting this thing for nine weeks or whenever Kansas City was,\" Carroll said. \"Each week, he has done everything you could possibly imagine a guy could do to play. We've worked with him to get through it. After an evaluation we did on Monday or Tuesday, it's just too bad. He didn't want to take the news like that. I didn't want to take the news like that. ... If we'd have let him, he'd have been out there, and he would not have hesitated. But he knows he's banged up.\"He said, 'I'd like to get out of here,'\" Carroll added. \"I said, 'Yeah, get out of here. Take off.'\"\nAsked to characterize Crosby's reaction to being shut down, Carroll said it was \"exactly like you think he would do and should do.\" Knowing Crosby's competitive nature, Carroll said he expected that response, especially since Crosby has been battling through the injury for weeks.\"As a matter of fact, I anticipated it all the way throughout,\" Carroll said. \"I've been with him since I saw him get on the bus in the Kansas City game -- just having trouble stepping up onto the bus and getting out of that game. He's just been fighting his ass off the whole time. He's impeccably positioned himself as good a competitor as you can be. You can't battle more than he's battled. He'd do anything to be playing.\"\n        \n            \n                Battle for draft top pick: Giants at Raiders set for rare Week 17 matchup that NFL hasn't seen in 44 years\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nCarroll denied that this decision would cause a rift between Crosby and the organization, despite speculation that the star pass rusher could now be a trade target in the offseason. While he didn't rule out Crosby for Week 18, Carroll did say it was a possibility.\nAt 2-13, the Raiders and Giants are both in contention for the No. 1 pick in the 2026 NFL Draft and their Week 17 meeting will have major implications on which team picks first in April. The Raiders are 2.5-point home underdogs against the Giants, per DraftKings Sportsbook. Crosby was asked about the possibility of the Raiders landing the No. 1 pick earlier this week and was blunt with his feelings on the subject.\"I don't give a s--- about the pick to be honest,\" Crosby told reporters Tuesday. \"I don't play for that. That's not my job. My job is to be the best defensive end in the world and that's what I'm focused on every day, and being a great leader and being an influence -- being that guy on a consistent basis for my team. That's [the NFL Draft] their job, the front office, the coaches, they do that. But that's got nothing to do with me.\" \nThe 28-year-old Crosby, one of the NFL's top pass rushers, has long been thought of as a top trade candidate, especially for a Las Vegas team that seems headed toward a long rebuild period. The Dallas Cowboys reportedly showed significant interest in Crosby before the 2025 trade deadline, but no deal materialized.Crosby, who has been vocal about his desire to stay with the Raiders, signed a three-year contract extension worth $106.5 million in March. At the time, it made him the highest-paid non-quarterback in the NFL. A fourth-round pick of the Raiders in the 2019 NFL Draft, Crosby has two second-team All-Pro honors and five Pro Bowl appearances during his time with the Raiders. He led the NFL in tackles for loss from 2022-23 and has reached double-digit sacks in three of the last four seasons. In 15 games this season, Crosby has 73 tackles, 28 tackles for loss and 10 sacks. \n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo is expected to return to the lineup against the Chicago Bulls on Saturday night, per The Athletic. Antetokounmpo hasn't played since Dec. 3, when he suffered a right calf strain against the Detroit Pistons, but will be back on the court in Chicago as long as he gets through pregame tests with the Bucks' medical staff. Antetokounmpo was listed as questionable on the team's Saturday afternoon injury report. Antetokounmpo has missed eight games while dealing with the injury, and the Bucks went 2-6 in that span. As a result, Antetokounmpo -- should he play Saturday as anticipated -- rejoins a team that's 12-19 and in 11th place in the Eastern Conference. That should only reignite the trade rumors that swirled around Antetokounmpo right before his injury.Earlier this month, reports surfaced that Antetokounmpo was eyeing a potential exit from Milwaukee. The two-time NBA MVP did his best to shift blame onto his representation but acknowledged that his agent ultimately works for him and not the other way around.\n\"If my agent is talking to the Bucks about it, he is his own person. He can have any conversation he wants about it,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"At the end of the day, I don't work for my agent, my agent works for me. There's going to be conversations that are going to be made between him and the Bucks and him and his other players and him and other teams and other GMs, executives around the league.\"\n        \n            \n                Everybody in Milwaukee is mishandling the Giannis Antetokounmpo trade saga\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe situation could be headed toward a messy split with both parties making their fair share of mistakes throughout this saga. For now, Antetokounmpo remains a member of the Bucks, and he will try to help as Milwaukee claw its way back into the postseason picture.\nThrough 17 games this season, Antetokounmpo has been as productive as ever. He's averaging 28.9 points, 10.1 rebounds and 6.1 assists per game. He's also shooting 63.9% from the field, which is a career high.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Saturday afternoon's SoFi Stadium showdown between the Houston Texans (10-5) and the Los Angeles Chargers (11-4) possesses plenty of postseason implications. The Texans can return to the playoffs for the third consecutive season through two paths: defeating the Chargers or by the Indianapolis Colts losing versus the AFC South-leading Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday. An AFC West title is still on the table for the Chargers, who can knock off the Broncos in Week 18 by winning against the Texans on Saturday before facing the Denver Broncos in their final regular-season game.   This matchup stars two of the hottest teams in the NFL with Houston winning 10 of the last 12 games and Los Angeles ripping off a string of seven victories in the last eight games. The outcome  will be determined by which offense can prevail against either the NFL's No. 1 scoring defense (the Texans, who are allowing 16.6 points per game) or the NFL's No. 8 scoring defense (the Chargers, who are allowing 20.1 points per game). Where to watch Chargers vs. TexansDate: Saturday, Dec. 27 | Time: 4:30 p.m. ETLocation: SoFi Stadium (Inglewood, California)TV: NFL Network | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Chargers -1.5, O/U 39.5 (via DraftKings Sportsbook)\nTexans vs. Chargers: Need to knowCan Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert evade the Texans' pass rush? The Texans are the NFL's best scoring defense (16.6 points per game allowed) and total defense (272.3 total yards per game allowed in 2025, and the last time they faced the Los Angeles Chargers, they threw quarterback Justin Herbert in a locker. Back in the 2024 AFC wild card round, the Texans coerced Herbert into four interceptions, and they sacked him four times in a 32-12 blowout loss. Herbert threw more interceptions than he did in the entire 2024 regular season (three).  This season with injuries to both starting tackles, Rashawn Slater and Joe Alt, the Chargers quarterback has remained under siege: Herbert is being pressured on 42.4% of his dropbacks this season, the highest rate in the NFL. That's bad news facing Pro Bowl edge rusher Danielle Hunter, whose 9.0 sacks during Houston's seven-game winning streak are the second-most in the league in that span behind only NFL sacks leader Myles Garrett's 12.0 in that stretch. Hunter's 13.0 sacks overall this season are tied with Chargers edge rusher Tuli Tuipulotu for the third-most in the league. Just behind him is teammate Will Anderson Jr.'s 11.5 sacks, tied for the seventh-most in football. \nHerbert will have his hands full against the best pass rush duo in football. How will Texans QB C.J. Stroud handle Chargers' zone defense? Much of Houston quarterback C.J. Stroud's success this season has come against man coverage: he has completed 63.6% of his passes vs. man, the third-highest rate entering Week 17, with an average yards per pass attempt of 7.4, the eighth-most in the NFL entering Week 17. Stroud has thrown the most touchdowns without an interception, 13, against man coverage this season. However, he's been significantly worse against zone coverage this season: his 66.3% completion rate against zone is the ninth-lowest in the league entering Week 17 with only three touchdowns and all six of his interceptions. The Chargers run zone on 82.9% of their defensive plays, the second-highest rate in football. Los Angeles' 17 interceptions as a team are tied for the third-most in the NFL with the Texans, and 14 of them have come in zone coverage. Chargers rookie RB Omarion Hampton could be X factorOne way to slow down an opposing pass rush is a strong running game, and the return of Hampton from an early-season ankle injury could be the difference for Herbert and the Chargers in this matchup against the Texans. Hampton has forced a missed tackle on 32.7% of his carries, the highest rate in the NFL and the only figure above 30% among running backs with at least 100 carries, per NFL Pro. Texans vs. Chargers prediction, pickChargers wide receiver Quentin Johnston rediscovered his TCU form (104 yards and a touchdown on four catches) in Week 16 in a 34-17 domination of the Dallas Cowboys.  Hampton seems to be operating at full tilt after an efficient 85 yards rushing and a touchdown on 16 carries -- 5.3 yards per carry --- last week. The Texans' defense will have to respect Hampton, which will allow Herbert to have he wasn't able to against Houston a year ago when dropping back to pass, particularly on play-action. That will lead to the Chargers exacting revenge for their postseason disappointment last year. \nPick: Chargers 24, Texans 20 | (Los Angeles -1.5, Over 39.5)\n            ",

    "body": "\n        When No. 10 Miami and No. 2 Ohio State meet on New Year's Eve in the Cotton Bowl, it will be a postseason rematch more than two decades in the making.  The last time the Buckeyes and Hurricanes met in college football's postseason it was for the national championship in the 2003 Fiesta Bowl, ending in such a controversial Ohio State win that the ref who made the fateful pass interference call is still a household name in some circles (Terry Porter, as Miami fans will tell you). Looking for a second consecutive championship and armed with a preposterously talented roster, Miami was 11.5-point favorites against the Buckeyes in Tempe. Ohio State won 31-24 in double overtime. \nOn the final day of this year, Miami and Ohio State meet in the College Football Playoff quarterfinals, and while the stakes aren't quite as high with the winner needing two more wins to capture another national title, both programs have plenty on the line.  It's somewhat poetic that the roles are reversed from the 2003 Fiesta Bowl. This year, the Buckeyes come into the Cotton Bowl as the heavy favorites and defending national champions, looking to win back-to-back titles for the first time in school history. Miami, meanwhile, is a team trying to rekindle the glory of the past and return to the top of the sport for the first time in more than two decades.  \nBack in 2003, the Hurricanes were the favorites as the defending national champs with a stacked roster featuring loads of NFL talent. Miami's 2002 Starting Lineup Bolded text indicates future Round 1 NFL pick, italics denote All-America pick from that season.    PositionPlayerQBKen DorseyFBKyle CobiaRBWillis McGahee*WRAndre JohnsonWRKevin BeardTEKellen Winslow IILTCarlos JosephLGSherko Haji-RasouliCBrett Romberg*RGEd WilkinsRTVernon CareyDEAndrew WilliamsDTMatt WaltersDTWilliam JosephDEJerome McDougleWLBD.J. WilliamsMLBJonathan VilmaSLBHoward ClarkCBAntrel RolleCBKelly JenningsSSMaurice SikesFSSean TaylorKTodd SieversPFreddie CapshawKRRoscoe Parrish*Consensus All-AmericaIn the way of the Miami juggernaut was Ohio State, the once-storied program that had struggled to get all the way back to the mountaintop -- entering that game on a national title drought of over 30 years. \nOhio State's 31-24 win launched Buckeyes back to the top of the sport, and for the past 23 years they have maintained their place among college football's elite. The Buckeyes rarely slipped from the top 25 after their last AP national title in 1968, but could never quite get back to championship form. That changed with their dramatic Fiesta Bowl victory in 2003, and they've played in five national championship games since then, winning two.  For Miami, that game was the last time they played for a national title and the Hurricanes rather quickly fell out of the national conversation, spending the past 20 years struggling to break through on the national landscape. To put it in elementary terms, the median and mode of Miami's by-season win totals since 2003 is seven -- and the mean (average wins per season) is 7.68. Mario Cristobal has steadily changed the baseline for success in Coral Gables, though, with a 10-3 mark in 2024 and a glittery 11-2 record this season. Championship relevancy that for so long has been out of reach is quite quickly upon Miami's doorstep. \nA stunning upset of the Buckeyes on New Year's Eve would be a full-circle moment for Miami. While no one on this current Hurricanes squad remembers that 2003 Fiesta Bowl -- Carson Beck was born two months earlier, Malachi Toney four-and-a-half-years later -- the shadows of that night have haunted the program for decades. Mere mention of that game will draw a deep sigh and a lengthy rant about what could have been for the Canes (Willis McGahee's gruesome knee injury) and how it was stolen from them (a pass interference call gave Ohio State a second chance in overtime). In July of 2003, Dennis Dodd wrote up a piece for CBS Sports vindicating referee Porter's decision to throw a flag.  In the eyes of the head officiating bosses, where Porter mostly erred was in his delayed timing. \nEarlier this year Big 12 commissioner Kevin Weiberg said game films had been reviewed and that, in fact, Porter had made the right call. The Big Ten supervisor of officials, who is used by the NCAA to assign officials for bowl games, concurred this week. \tThe problem is, few people saw the actual infraction. All the replays focused on Miami defensive back Glenn Sharpe jumping for a ball in the end zone intended for Ohio State receiver Chris Gamble. \tThe penalty occurred on fourth-and-3 from the Miami 5 in the first overtime of Ohio State's 31-24 victory. At the line of scrimmage, Sharpe tried to \"jam\" Gamble and impeded his progress. When the official who apparently had the call in the end zone didn't make one, Porter came rushing from the back of the end zone to throw the flag four or five seconds after the play had ended. \t\"The timing of the flag might have looked not good,\" said Dave Parry, the Big Ten supervisor of officials, who works with the NCAA. \"Terry was probably trying to be very thorough. He signaled a push for a defensive pass interference, then a signal for holding. There is a time lapse there. When the camera showed it they didn't see the line of scrimmage. They saw the downfield play about 7 or 8 yards.\" \tPorter has been the subject of Miami fans' message board rants for months since the call. Miami's stance seems to be that while the call might have been right, it was inexcusable that Porter waited those pregnant seconds before throwing the flag after running from the back of the end zone. \t\"I replayed it in my mind,\" Porter said after the game. \"I wanted to make double-sure that it was the right call.\" \tWithout saying it was the case, Parry said this week there could have been a \"small, small little downgrade\" in Porter's evaluation for shoddy mechanics in waiting so long to make the call.  \tIt's not just the way that game ended that still burns Miami fans, but the fact that it was the last time they were ever on that stage. A win would have changed so much. The 2001 Miami team that won the title has an argument as the greatest college team ever assembled. The 2002 team wasn't far off and had they repeated with a win over the Buckeyes, perhaps the Hurricanes would've cemented themselves as the dominant force in the world of college football. Instead, and quite quickly, USC one season later began the decade's most dynastic run. Miami fans have watched as the Buckeyes and others jumped over them after that Fiesta Bowl to become the nation's dominant programs and can't help but wonder what could've been if that flag hadn't been thrown. Would the last 20 years still have played out the same way? Or would back-to-back national titles have changed their fortunes and given them a stronger foothold at the top of the sport?Miami has not finished a season in the top 10 of the AP poll since. That will almost change this year after a first round CFP victory over Texas A&M, but the Hurricanes believe they should be a national title threat, not just a top 10 finisher.  That's what Cristobal was brought in to do, and Wednesday night will be his first real chance to prove Miami is back at that level.  The old adage of \"to be the best, you have to beat the best\" will be firmly in play on Wednesday night in Dallas. Almost 23 years to the day since Ohio State did exactly that to claim the national title over a dominant Miami team, the Hurricanes will attempt to exact some revenge over the Buckeyes.  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Clemson coach Dabo Swinney looked at the scoreboard with a blank stare following tight end Christian Bentancur's third-down drop, the fifth of the Tigers' season-high six, early in the fourth quarter of a lifeless 22-10 loss to Penn State in Saturday's Pinstripe Bowl.Clemson's final record of 7-6 was a smidge better than the Tigers' 6-7 mark in 2010, but all would quantify this as the worst individual campaign under Swinney given the expectation level. Swinney predicted Clemson could be college football's \"first 16-0\" team in August, but the season quickly unraveled for a preseason top-five squad that was returning a slew of starters from last season's team that won the ACC championship and reached the College Football Playoff. The Tigers began the season by going 3-4, including a defeat to SMU that marked the program's fifth straight home loss to Power Four competition, nearly resulting in their first losing season since 2010.Saturday's meeting with the Nittany Lions -- another team with massive preseason expectations -- was one of the uglier games thus far of bowl season during a frigid afternoon at Yankee Stadium. These were not the rosters most expected would compete for a playoff spot this fall. Four of Penn State's defensive starters did not play, including the team's second-leading tackler (safety Zakee Wheatley) and defensive tackle Zane Durant, who managed the second-most sacks on the team (four). \nThe Nittany Lions were also without four starting offensive linemen and star running backs Kaytron Allen and Nicholas Singleton, two of the most decorated offensive players in program history. Between injuries and opt-outs, Clemson had a high number of players unavailable as well, including seven offensive starters and seven defensive starters, many of whom elected to prepare early for the NFL Draft rather than continue for a forgettable exhibition.Saturday's last performance of 2025 for the Tigers was nauseating for a myriad reasons, namely another repugnant outing offensively with three-year starting quarterback Cade Klubnik playing in his final college game. Outside of a fourth-quarter touchdown drive aided by a fourth-down conversion, Clemson totaled only 236 yards on 3.6 yards per play, punted five times, turned it over on downs twice, made a field goal and whiffed on another across 10 offensive possessions. Klubnik finished just 22 of 39 for 193 yards and his final play summarized a season of underperformance for the once-heralded star, a fourth-down sack with 2:29 to play on an icy field that put Penn State in prime position to close out its fourth straight victory under interim coach Terry Smith.\nUncomfortable decisions upcoming for ClemsonSwinney's expected to make coaching staff changes after this team's fall from grace, confirming he would last month with a preference for doing so after the bowl game. That time is now and his decisions will have a lasting impression on how this program looks under his watch in 2026 and beyond.Offensively, Clemson took a massive step back under third-year coordinator Garrett Riley. Klubnik went from preseason Heisman candidate to a mid-level option in the ACC after his touchdown total was cut in half during his final go-around. Clemson's 28.7 points per game entering the Pinstripe Bowl and its number of explosive plays were the program's lowest production numbers since 2021, leading to speculation about Riley's future and where Swinney wants to go with his scheme pushing forward.The rocky season was agonizing in early November following a 46-45 home loss to Duke after Swinney joked he \"may get fired\" with Clemson athletic director Graham Neff nearby in the media room. Amid a season of frustration, Swinney had seemingly hit a boiling point before taking aim at officials, resulting in a fine from the ACC.\nFor the first time in his coaching career (outside of a few additions) in the transfer portal era, Swinney expects to be active on college football's free agent market next month. He's late to the party, but after signing only 20 players in his 2026 high school recruiting class and suffering a few decommitments, numbers suggest the Tigers need more.\"The good news is the portal has been moved [back to Jan. 2],\" Swinney said earlier this month before several NFL Draft announcements. \"I still think it needs to be changed, but it's in a better spot so we can focus on this part of it, and then you can kind of see how your roster shakes out and you fill the gaps that you have.\" The players Swinney evaluates and plucks from the portal and pending alterations he makes to his staff should decide next season's fate. \nFor now, however, Clemson's no longer feared as a national championship threat in the expanded playoff era.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Week 17 in the NFL is setting up to be an incredible week. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers will look to rebound against the Miami Dolphins, the New York Giants and Las Vegas Raiders will battle for the No. 1 overall pick, and the San Francisco 49ers aim to win their sixth straight game against a feisty Chicago Bears team.Who's scoring today? That's what everyone wants to know. Whether you're crafting the group-chat parlay or looking for a lesser-known name with some value, anytime TD bets have become one of the most popular wagers in the world of sports gambling. Below, we will break down five anytime TD bets to consider for Week 17. These will not be predictable choices like a Derrick Henry or Jonathan Taylor score, but they won't be wild long shots such as a team defense. Let's begin with an offense that found its rhythm last week. Odds courtesy of DraftKings Sportsbook1. WR Ja'Marr Chase, Cincinnati Bengals (-150)\nThe Arizona Cardinals have lost seven consecutive games, and rank last in scoring defense since Week 6 with 31.8 points allowed per game. Maybe more importantly, the Cards rank bottom 10 in passing defense with 224.1 yards allowed per contest. The Bengals are coming off a dominant 45-21 win over the Miami Dolphins, in which Joe Burrow threw for 309 yards and four touchdowns. While Ja'Marr Chase led Cincy with 109 yards receiving, he didn't find the end zone. This week, he will. \n\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 17 odds, predictions, expert picks: Can Ravens upset Packers on Saturday night?\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n2. WR Mike Evans, Tampa Bay Buccaneers (+140)\nMike Evans has caught 11 passes for 163 yards and a touchdown in his two games since returning from injury. The Bucs need a win against the lowly Dolphins to guarantee they remain alive in the NFC South race, and I'm predicting Baker Mayfield comes out angry after Tampa Bay dropped six out of its last seven games. Evans finds the end zone.3. RB Saquon Barkley, Philadelphia Eagles (-105)\nThe reigning NFL Offensive Player of the Year has not only scored touchdowns in three straight games, but has also crossed 122 yards rushing in two out of the last three contests. This week, Barkley faces off against one of the worst run defenses in the NFL with the Buffalo Bills. They entered this week ranked third-worst in the league, allowing 144.3 rushing yards per game. Buffalo also allows 5.4 yards per rush, which ranks second-worst, and has allowed the most 30-yard rushing touchdowns in a season in NFL history with eight. This is a good matchup for Barkley and Jalen Hurts. 4. RB Tony Pollard, Tennessee Titans (+175)\nThe Titans are playing well these days. They've scored at least 24 points in the last three games, which includes a surprising shootout victory over the Cleveland Browns and a 26-9 beatdown of the Kansas City Chiefs last Sunday. Tony Pollard has been spectacular, having crossed 100 yards rushing in each of the last three games. He rushed for a career-high 161 yards and two touchdowns against Cleveland three games ago. Pollard didn't find the end zone last week, but I'm betting he does Sunday against the New Orleans Saints.\n5. WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Seattle Seahawks (-105)\nIf you bet on JSN to score a touchdown every week, you've won eight times and lost just seven. That's a pretty incredible run. Smith-Njigba leads the NFL in receiving yards (1,647), and has reached 90 yards receiving in 10 out of the last 11 games. Sunday marks a revenge game for Sam Darnold, who would surely like to blow out his former team in the Carolina Panthers. JSN will again be a major part of the game plan.\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe NFL Week 18 Saturday matchup between the Carolina Panthers and Tampa Bay Buccaneers will go a long way in determining who wins the NFC South and earns a playoff berth. Carolina (8-8) faces a win-and-in scenario, while Tampa (7-9) must win to have a shot at the postseason. The Bucs need a win and an Atlanta loss to New Orleans on Sunday to clinch a postseason spot and the NFC's No. 4 seed. Both teams are coming off Week 17 losses, while the Bucs have dropped four in a row overall, including a loss to the Panthers in Week 16. Starting cornerback Jamel Dean (shoulder) is out for Tampa Bay. Linebacker Claudin Cherelus (calf/ankle) is out for Carolina, while defensive lineman Tershawn Wharton (hamstring) is inactive after being listed as questionable on the injury report.Kickoff is at 4:30 p.m. ET from Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Fla. The latest Panthers vs. Buccaneers odds list Tampa as the 3-point favorite, while the over/under for total points scored is 43.5 via DraftKings Sportsbook.

Tampa has dropped a staggering eight straight games ATS, as its 5-11 record versus the line this year is the worst in the NFL. The Bucs are just 1-6 ATS at home, while Carolina brings a 9-5 spread record as an underdog in 2025. On the field, the Panthers can take advantage of the Bucs' No. 30 redzone defense and a team that hasn't won the turnover battle in each of its last four games, which were all straight-up defeats. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Buccaneers can coverTampa has owned the recent matchups in this series, going 9-2 over their last 11 meetings. The Buccaneers also have the edge in one of the most important stats in any level of football, and that's the turnover margin. The Bucs have the fifth-best turnover differential (plus-five) in the NFL, while the Panthers are just tied for 14th with as many takeaways as giveaways. Tampa Bay also has a clear strength of running the ball as it has the No. 7 rush offense, despite missing Bucky Irving for nearly half of the season. Thus, the Buccaneers can exploit Carolina's run defense, which ranks 24th in terms of yards per rush allowed, and just three teams have given up more rushing touchdowns (24) than the Panthers. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Buccaneers vs. Panthers picksSportsLine's model has simulated Panthers vs. Buccaneers 10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 48 combined points. It also says one side of the spread hits in more than 50% of simulations. You can only get the pick at SportsLine. So who wins Bucs vs. Panthers, and which side of the spread hits more than 50% of the time? Visit SportsLine now to see which side of the Panthers vs. Bucs spread to jump on, all from the advanced model that is up well over $7,000 on its NFL picks since its inception, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Ole Miss might lose most of its LSU-bound coaches to former coach Lane Kiffin this week, but it will keep at least one critical piece of the offensive staff in place as the Rebels prepare for the semifinals of the College Football Playoff.Offensive coordinator Charlie Weis Jr. is in Oxford and will continue leading the Rebels' offensive unit through at least this week's semifinals game, head coach Pete Golding confirmed Saturday. Weis Jr. is set to take over as LSU's OC whenever the time comes. Several position coaches, however, are expected to remain at LSU after coaching the Rebels to a thrilling 39-34 victory against Georgia in the quarterfinals on New Year's Day, sources told CBS Sports.Running backs coach Kevin Smith will not return to Oxford this week, 247Sports' Chase Parham first reported Saturday. Tight ends coach Joe Cox, receivers coach George McDonald, analyst Dan Stevens (quarterbacks) and graduate assistant Sawyer Jordan (slot receivers) are also in flux and are not expected as of Saturday to return to Ole Miss, sources told CBS Sports. They remained In Baton Rouge, helping with recruiting visitors after the transfer portal opened Friday.\nGolding, who was elevated from defensive coordinator to head coach when Kiffin bolted for LSU, did not confirm the status of the position coaches, but said he has been in \"constant\" communication with LSU and Kiffin about the staffing situation. Kiffin echoed those words in a statement to ESPN on Friday.\"They have every opportunity like they have up to this point to be able to make that decision,\" Golding said Saturday. \"So, week in and week out, I don't dictate whether they do that or not because they're not employed by me. Up to this point, that is how it's been and that's my expectation.\"Questions about Ole Miss' staff have lingered over the program since Kiffin left the program to take over at LSU on Dec. 1. He hired eight staffers from Ole Miss to his LSU staff. However, many remained in Oxford through the first two rounds of the playoff -- a 41-10 win against Tulane and the aforementioned thriller against Georgia.\nComplicating matters is the football calendar. The transfer portal opened Jan. 1 and will remain open until Jan. 16, and both schools were expected to host players for visits this weekend.FBS programs are allowed an unlimited number of staffers after previously only allowing 11 on-field coaches, which has alleviated much of the workload, Golding said.\"We've got a lot of coaches here,\" Golding said. \"This building is filled with guys that have been elite coaches everywhere they've been. Once (the NCAA) eliminated the rule to where there's not 10 coaches, as long as they're employed here, you can have a million coaches that can instruct on the field. So at every college across the country, a lot of guys that you all don't know by name are actually the ones instructing and teaching players, and so we have an elite staff here that's been together for a long time that knows the ins and the outs.\"\nGolding said he wasn't sure when he'd receive clarity on the staffing situation. Ole Miss departs for the Fiesta Bowl on Tuesday. Kickoff is slated for Thursday at 7:30 p.m. ET.\"It's grown people making decisions, so I have no idea,\" he said. \"So we're gonna go out there and spot the ball. We've got plenty of people in this building that showed up this morning. We'll be just fine.\"LSU did not immediately respond to CBS Sports' request for comment.\n            ",

The Raiders (2-14) are the favorites to win the top pick in the NFL Draft as they haven't won since Week 6. A 34-10 loss to the nearly as inept Giants last week was their 10th in a row. The Chiefs were eliminated from the playoffs in Week 15, and star quarterback Patrick Mahomes was lost with a torn ACL in that loss to the Chargers. The Raiders have won just three meetings between the teams since 2013, and Kansas City has won nine of the past 10 matchups.    Kickoff from Allegiant Stadium is set for 4:25 p.m. ET on CBS and Paramount+. The Chiefs are 5.5-point road favorites in its latest Chiefs vs. Raiders odds at DraftKings, and the over/under for total points is set at 36.5.

The top seeds in both the AFC and NFC are still at stake, as is who is going to take the NFC South and AFC North title and the playoff spot that comes with it.

If the Broncos falter against the Los Angeles Chargers, New England can take top honors with a win over Miami.    There are a number of important matchups on the Week 18 NFL schedule, including two on Saturday with Panthers vs. Buccaneers (-3) and Seahawks vs. 49ers (+2.5). The rest of the slate is Sunday, including Colts vs. Texans (-10.5), Packers vs. Vikings (-10), Lions vs. Bears (-3), Chargers vs. Broncos (-13.5), Dolphins vs. Patriots (-11.5) and Commanders vs. Eagles (-4). The Ravens (-3.5) face the Steelers on 'Sunday Night Football' in Pittsburgh with the AFC North on the line. Before locking in any Week 18 NFL picks or NFL parlays, be sure to see the NFL predictions and betting advice from SportsLine's proven computer model.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

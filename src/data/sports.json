Of his 26 victories, 20 have come via knockout, five have come via decision, and just one has come from submitting his opponent. Of his five defeats, three have come from being knocked out and two have been via submission. Gaethje has never lost a decision in his professional career.Fighting out of Denver, Gaethje is aiming for his second Interim UFC Lightweight Championship after winning it the first time at UFC 249 in a TKO victory over Tony Ferguson. However, he then lost his next bout for the UFC Lightweight Championship, falling to Khabib Nurmagomedov. Gaethje had another shot to claim gold when he challenged Charles Oliveira for the title at UFC 274 but again came up short. He has held the symbolic UFC \"BMF\" title, which he won via a triumph over Dustin Poirier at UFC 291. Check out SportsLine to see Vithlani's picks and analysis.Pimblett, 31, has a BJJ background and made his professional debut as a 17-year-old in his native Liverpool, England. He fought at bantamweight and featherweight for over five years before moving up to lightweight in 2018. Since then, he's won 10 of 11 bouts, including each of the last nine, and Pimblett sports a 7-0 record since joining UFC in 2021. He can triumph in a number of ways as of his 23 victories, 10 have been via submission, seven have come thanks to a knockout, and six have been via winning on the scorecards.While he won championships in other promotions, UFC 324 will be his first title bout since linking up with the promotion. Pimblett, however, has been awarded Performance of the Night in five of his last seven fights, including in back-to-back bouts. He's also a perfect 3-0 in his MMA career in Las Vegas, while Gaethje sports a 3-1 record in Sin City. You can only see UFC 324 picks and analysis at SportsLine. UFC 324: Gaethje vs. Pimblett predictionsOne of of Vithlani's UFC 324 picks: He's backing Nikita Krylov (+125) over Modestas Bukauskas (-150) in a light heavyweight matchup on the preliminary card. Krylov (30-11) is No. 13 in light heavyweight rankings, while Bukauskas (19-6) is unranked. The former has advantages over his opponent in a number of metrics, including significant strikes landed per minute, significant strikes accuracy and takedowns average. Bukauskas also lacks a diversified attack as just one of his last 17 bouts have seen him win via submission, while Krylov has over a dozen MMA wins via both submission and with a knockout.\"[Krylov] seems very focused in this training camp and is still only 33 years old,\" Vithlani told SportsLine. \"If Krylov can find his old form, his MMA game will be a lot more diverse than Bukauskas. If Krylov can mix in his grappling, he will threaten with chokes and ground and pound to win this fight.\" See who else to back here. You can make this pick at FanDuel, where new users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to make UFC 324: Gaethje vs. Pimblett picksVithlani has strong picks for Gaethje vs. Pimblett and other bouts on the UFC 324 card.

    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL playoffs are down to four teams as the 2026 AFC Championship Game and the 2026 NFC Championship Game are both set to unfold on Sunday. The Broncos will host the Patriots in the AFC title game at 3 p.m. ET, and Denver's quarterback sittuation looms large in this matchup. Jarrett Stidham will replace Bo Nix, who was lost for the season on an ankle injury sustained late in Denver's win over Buffalo. The latest NFL odds from DraftKings Sportsbook list the Broncos as 4.5-point home underdogs with the total at 42.5. The NFC title game showcases the NFC West as the Seattle Seahawks (-2.5, 46.5) host the Los Angeles Rams. These teams split their head-to-head matchups in the regular season straight up, against the spread and on both sides of the total, so how should you formulate your NFL best bets this time around? SportsLine's Eric Cohen has revealed his exact score prediction for each game to help you formulate spread, over/under, money-line and NFL best bets as the conference championship games approach. A SportsLine expert and CBS on-air talent, Cohen has evaluated the entire NFL playoff slate and delivers score predictions and logic for each matchup. Cohen went 180-91-1 (66%) on his NFL straight-up picks this regular season, and was a sizzling 10-3 (77%) on his straight-up NFL playoff picks last season. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now he's turned his attention to the 2026 NFC Championship game and 2026 AFC Championship Game, studied each matchup and the NFL odds in depth, and has revealed his exact NFL score predictions for each game. All NFL betting lines via DraftKings Sportsbook.New England Patriots at Denver Broncos (+4.5)\n\"With two excellent defenses and Denver starting a backup quarterback, I just can't see this one turning into a Broncos-Bills type of shootout. My top play is the Under 41.5, give or take. I would probably play it down to 38.5 as I have a hard time seeing either team score more than 24 in this one. While I would've probably leaned Denver at home with a healthy Bo Nix, it's hard to imagine Jarrett Stidham pulling a Jeff Hostetler (see the 1990 Giants) and leading his team to the Super Bowl. Whereas the NFC game will likely be exciting to watch from an offensive standpoint, expect just the opposite here. Both of these teams have skated by with relatively easy schedules this season. This time, the Nix injury benefits New England significantly. The thing is, Drake Maye doesn't have to play well for New England to win. If the Patriots can run the ball effectively like Buffalo did last week, Denver is toast. And that's exactly what will happen.\"Pick: Patriots 21, Broncos 13Los Angeles Rams at Seattle Seahawks (-2.5)\n\"Dating back to 2024, Sam Darnold has faced the Rams four times. His teams are 1-3 in those games, with the one win being a large blown lead by Los Angeles and won on a 2-point conversion (in December 2025). He's thrown six interceptions against L.A. already this season and is once again likely not to be 100% on Sunday with an oblique injury. Meanwhile, Matthew Stafford hasn't thrown an interception against Seattle this season (5 TDs, 0 INTs). Though Stafford hasn't been at his best this postseason, I can't possibly pick Darnold over him in a big game. I saw these two face off in person last January in a playoff game moved to Arizona and if it was a prize fight, they would've stopped it in the third round. While I'm not expecting Rams star wide receiver Puka Nacua to post a 225 yard, two touchdown performance against Seattle like he did in Week 16, I'm also not sure that the Seahawks have an effective answer to slow him down. In yet another playoff thriller, Los Angeles moves on to the Super Bowl for the second time in five seasons.\"Pick: Rams 27, Seahawks 23How to get more NFL conference championship picksSportsLine's model has simulated both conference championship game 10,000 times and revealed its picks.

The Big Ten prefers a 24-team field with multiple automatic qualifiers per conference while the SEC is partial to a 16-team \"5+11\" format. Under the SEC's proposed model, which has the backing of the ACC and Big 12, guaranteed bids would go to the five highest-ranked conference champions. The Big Ten has also explored the possibility of a 24-team model with only one automatic bid that goes to the highest-ranked Group of Six champion. The other 23 spots would be occupied by automatic qualifiers. Sources told CBS Sports that the Big Ten was willing to commit to a 16-team field in the interim if other conferences agreed to shift to one of the proposed 24-team formats down the line. The second season of the 12-team format wrapped up Monday with Indiana beating Miami to win the national championship. \"There's no momentum to expand just for the sake of expanding,\" a power conference executive told CBS Sports' Brandon Marcello. \"There's this notion that college sports are really good about being reactionary and taking a short-term gain and not looking at the long-term implications of it.\"\nThe CFP management committee is tweaking the 12-team format in 2026. Now each of the Power Four champions are guaranteed a spot in the field regardless of where they are ranked at season's end. Notre Dame is also guaranteed an at-large bid if it finishes anywhere inside the top 12 of the final CFP rankings. Duke won the ACC championship with an 8-5 record in 2025 but did not qualify for the playoff after it was left out of the top 25. Notre Dame was the first team out of the 2025 field at No. 11. The Big Ten and the SEC have controlling interest in any adjustments to the playoff format. The ACC and the Big 12 are still pushing for equal access, including automatic qualifiers, for each of the Power Four conferences. Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark said in October that he would be open to discussing a 24-team format, though he prefers the 16-team model, while Jim Phillips of the ACC has been staunch in his support of a 16-team \"5+11\" format. \nThe Big Ten has won three straight College Football Playoff National Championships (Michigan in 2023, Ohio State in 2024 and Indiana in 2025), while the SEC has not reached the CFP title game since Georgia beat TCU to cap the 2022 season. Miami represented the ACC in the 2025-26 national title game. \n            \n    ",

The Seahawks are in the NFC title game for the first time in 11 years. \n        \n            \n                Prisco's NFL Championship Sunday picks: Jarrett Stidham does enough for Broncos, Seahawks lean on defense\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIn the AFC, the Denver Broncos are headed to the conference title game after beating the Buffalo Bills, 33-30 in overtime, in what was easily the wildest game of the divisional round. The Broncos' vaunted defense forced five turnovers, including four from Josh Allen, who threw two interceptions while also losing two fumbles. The top-seeded Broncos will now host New England in the AFC title game with a trip to Super Bowl LX on the line. The Patriots advanced on Sunday after beating the Texans, 28-16. The Broncos and Patriots are facing each other in the AFC title game for the third time in 13 years. The two previous meetings were both played in Denver and the Broncos won both of them. If the Broncos are going to get to the Super Bowl this year, they're going to have to do it without Bo Nix, who suffered a season-ending ankle injury against Buffalo. For the Patriots, it will mark their first trip to the conference title game since 2018 in what ended up being the final appearance by Tom Brady and Bill Belichick. With that in mind, let's take a look at the full playoff schedule.Divisional Round scheduleSaturday, Jan. 17(1) Broncos 33-30 (OT) over (6) Bills. The Broncos have had one of the best defenses in the NFL all year and Josh Allen found out firsthand why they're so good. The Bills turned the ball over five times with four of those coming from Allen. The Bills QB threw an interception in overtime that set up Denver's game-winning drive. Bo Nix also came up big for the Broncos, throwing for 279 yards and three touchdowns in the win. (1) Seahawks 41-6 over (6) 49ers. Rashid Shaheed returned the opening kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown and this game was essentially over after that. The Seahawks defense absolutely suffocated the 49ers, forcing three turnovers while sacking Brock Purdy twice. They also kept San Francisco out of the end zone for the second straight time after also holding the 49ers without a touchdown in Week 18. With Sam Darnold dealing with an oblique injury, the Seahawks put their offense in the hands of Kenneth Walker, who rushed for 116 yards and three touchdowns. Sunday, Jan. 18(2) Patriots 28-16 over (5) Texans. The Texans' defense was the best in the NFL all season, but it was the Patriots' defense that stole the show in this game. The Patriots forced five turnovers, including a pick-six from Marcus Jones in the second quarter that gave New England an early 14-10 lead. Drake Maye had some fumbling problems, but he also came up with some huge plays, including a 32-yard touchdown pass to Kayshon Boutte in the fourth quarter that iced the win. The Texans are now 0-7 in the divisional round in franchise history and are the only team in the NFL that has yet to make it to the conference title game. (5) Rams 20-17 (OT) over (2) Bears. The Rams pulled off a dramatic win that wasn't decided until Harrison Mevis drilled a 42-yard field goal in overtime. The only reason the game made it to overtime is because Caleb Williams threw a miraculous 14-yard touchdown pass on fourth down with under 30 seconds left to play. The Bears looked like they were going to pull out the win in overtime, but Williams threw an interception that set up the Rams' game-winning drive. Championship SundaySunday, Jan. 25\nAFC ChampionshipPatriots at Broncos, 3 p.m. ET (CBS, Paramount+)NFC ChampionshipRams at Seahawks, 6:30 p.m. ET (Fox; Fubo, try for free)Super Bowl LXSunday, Feb. 8AFC champion vs. NFC champion at Levi's Stadium (Santa Clara, California), 6:30 p.m. ET (NBC)Wild Card resultsSaturday, Jan. 10(5) Rams 34-31 over (4) PanthersRams vs. Panthers recap: The Panthers almost pulled off the upset, but they couldn't stop Matthew Stafford with the game on the line. With the Rams trailing 31-27, Stafford engineered a 71-yard game-winning scoring drive that ended when he hit Colby Parkinson with a 19-yard touchdown with just 38 seconds left to play. Stafford threw for 304 yards and three touchdowns in the win. (2) Bears 31-27 over (7) PackersPackers vs. Bears recap: The Bears pulled off the third-largest fourth-quarter comeback in NFL history. Going into the final quarter, the Bears were trailing by 15 points, but they were able to erase that deficit during a miracle quarter where they outscored the Packers, 25-6. Caleb Williams threw for more yardage (184) in the fourth quarter than he did in the first three quarters combined (177). Williams capped things off with a 25-yard score to DJ Moore with just 1:43 left to win the game. Sunday, Jan. 11(6) Bills 27-24 over (3) JaguarsBills vs. Jaguars recap: For the first time in his career, Josh Allen led a game-winning drive in the fourth quarter of a playoff game. The Bills' franchise quarterback scored the game-winning touchdown on a 1-yard run with just one minute left to play. Allen also threw a 15-yard TD pass in the fourth quarter to help propel Buffalo to the win. Allen totaled 306 yards and three touchdowns in the win. For the Bills, it was their first road playoff win in 33 years. (6) 49ers 23-19 over (3) Eagles49ers vs. Eagles recap: The 49ers pulled off a shocker by going on the road and knocking off the Eagles. After losing George Kittle, the 49ers had some unlikely heroes, including Demarcus Robinson, who caught six passes for 111 yards and a touchdown. Christian McCaffrey also came up big with two touchdowns, including the game-winning score, which came on a 4-yard pass from Brock Purdy with just 2:54 left to play. (2) Patriots 16-3 over (7) ChargersChargers vs. Patriots recap: The Patriots defense took over and carried New England to the win. Justin Herbert was sacked six times as the Patriots kept the Chargers out of the end zone and held them to fewer than 210 total yards.The offense didn't light up the scoreboard, but Drake Maye was impressive in his first career postseason start, throwing for 268 yards and rushing for 66 more. The Patriots are headed to the divisional round for the first time since 2018.Monday, Jan. 12(5) Texans 30-6 over (4) Steelers\nTexans vs. Steelers recap. The Texans had the best defense in the NFL during the regular season, and that unit carried them to a win against Pittsburgh. The Texans defense sacked Aaron Rodgers four times, held the Steelers to just 175 yards and scored two touchdowns, which both came in the fourth quarter. The first one came on a 33-yard fumble return by Sheldon Rankins, and then Calen Bullock followed that up with a 50-yard pick six with just 2:39 left in the game. It was a defensive masterpiece by a Texans team that picked up its first road win in franchise history\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        In the first seven seconds of overtime against South Carolina, Oklahoma freshman Aaliyah Chavez had a bad pass turnover. In the rest of the extra period, she solidified her position as the top Freshman of the Year candidate. Chavez finished the night with 26 points, and 15 of those came during the extra period to lift No. 16 Oklahoma to a 94-82 upset over No. 2 South Carolina. This was only the Sooners' third win ever against an AP top two team, and most importantly, this statement win helped them get back on the right track by snapping a three-game losing streak. The win came almost exactly a year after South Carolina crushed Oklahoma 101-60. Raegan Beers is still the veteran leader of this team, but the addition of Chavez is injecting even more energy into the program.Her shot selection is sometimes questionable and there is certainly room for her to grow, but Chavez doesn't shy away after mistakes. She plays fearlessly and that is exactly what helped her team on Thursday night. Despite starting the game shooting just 1 of 7 from the field, Chavez took over when her team needed her the most. \n\"She just played,\" coach Jennie Baranczyk said postgame. \"And the joy she played with and the energy she played with, but she had the same energy for her team the whole game. There was a difference in us today that really allowed her to do that. I think everybody on her team knows that's in her, knows it will come out and has an incredible belief in the person that she is.\"Chavez is currently averaging 18.8 points, 4.0 rebounds, 4.1 assists and 1.8 steals per game. Those numbers are comparable to the ones from the freshman years of recent college basketball stars, including Caitlin Clark, Paige Bueckers and Hannah Hidalgo.\nEarlier this month, Chavez had a chance to put her team within one possession against Kentucky with six seconds remaining in the game. She got a good look, but her 3-point attempt fell short and Kentucky eventually took a 63-57 win. That moment was on her mind when Oklahoma was trying to finish the job against South Carolina.\n\"I kind of thought back to the Kentucky game where I missed the shot,\" Chavez recounted. \"Raegan (Beers) was the first one next to me who was like, 'forget about it, forget about it. Just let it go.' We've been talking in practice a lot and we've been drawing up last-second plays, and you can see that they have all the confidence in me. So I kind of just brought their confidence and I gave it to myself, and I was just ready to play in overtime.\"Chavez entered the season as the No. 1 player in the 247Sports class of 2025 rankings. She was playing well, but up until Thursday, the race for Freshman of the Year had multiple candidates with resumes good enough to compete. These included USC's Jazzy Davidson, Gonzaga's Lauren Whittaker and UConn's Blanca Quiñonez. Although there is still a lot of basketball left to play this season, a clutch performance against the No. 2 team in the nation certainly raised Chavez's stock.Here are other recent women's college basketball storylines:Iowa continues to riseOn Monday, the Hawkeyes entered the AP Top 10 for the first time in the Jan Jensen era and the first time since Caitlin Clark's senior year. Iowa kept that momentum going with an 85-78 overtime win against Maryland on Thursday night. \nSure, the Hawkeyes blew a 17-point lead with 3:15 remaining in regulation, but at the end of the day, they got a solid win on the road and Iowa is still undefeated in the Big Ten.\"'We have a decision right now,'\" Jensen recounted her message to her team before overtime. \"'We got five more minutes. Do we want to be timid and we want to let something that we fought so hard for slip away? Or do we want to play five minutes hard and take what we think we want to get?'\"...For us to calm down and still handle all that, that was a heck of a win and I'm really, really proud of them.\"\nTexas Tech is now on a losing streakThe Lady Raiders were one of the last three undefeated teams remaining with a 19-0 start, their best since the 1992-93 season. However, Texas Tech stumbled for the first time with a 65-59 loss against Kansas State on Jan. 17. They were outrebounded 46-20 in that game, which was a season low in rebounds for the Lady Raiders. They then suffered a 73-61 loss BYU on Wednesday while shooting just 19 of 57 from the field, or 33%, which was their lowest shooting percentage of the season.Up next, Texas Tech will hit the road to take on Utah on Saturday night. The Utes already showed how dangerous they can be when they got an 87-77 overtime victory over then-No. 8 TCU earlier this month.\nWinter weather affects schedulesA major winter storm is expected to hit the country this weekend, which has led to multiple games getting rescheduled. Here are the ranked teams whose games have been affected so far:No. 1 UConn's game at Seton Hall in New Jersey was moved from Sunday to Saturday at noon. No. 21 Duke's game at Pitt was also moved from Sunday to Saturday at 4 p.m. ET.Brown is still hosting No. 20 Princeton on Saturday, but the game has been moved to from 2 p.m. to 12 p.m. ET.Game to watch this weekend:Vanderbilt at South Carolina, Sunday 1/25 at 3 p.m. ET on ESPNAn 81-53 win over Auburn on Thursday helped No. 5 Vanderbilt register a 20-0 start for the first time in program history. Besides No. 1 UConn, the Commodores are the only other undefeated team remaining in women's college basketball. They have already collected some quality wins against LSU and Michigan, but their next matchup might be their toughest one yet. Vanderbilt took down LSU in Tennessee, but now Shea Ralph's squad has to face South Carolina on the road. The Gamecocks will pose a particularly difficult challenge because they will be looking to bounce back from their overtime loss to Oklahoma. The game is set for Sunday at 3 p.m. ET and will be available on ESPN.\n            ",

This Seattle defense is much better than that Bears group. But Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford has had success against them in the two games.\"The Seattle defense is the best unit of any left in the playoffs, which will challenge McVay to come up with new ways to move the football. The Rams lack great outside speed, and that showed up last week at Chicago. Keep an eye on that in this one. \"On the other side, the Rams defense has had some leakage issues in the secondary over the past six weeks. It is not a great group. The good news is Seattle wants to run it more than throw it.\n\"Seattle quarterback Sam Darnold is the key. If he can take care of the football, which he didn't do in a playoff loss to the Rams last year when he was with the Vikings, the Seahawks will win the game. I think he does. The Seattle defense is playing too good right now.

They also haven't allowed a touchdown over their last two games, dating to the regular season.\n\"Matthew Stafford did have success against this defense earlier this year, but the veteran quarterback was a bit shaky at times last week against a Chicago defense that isn't in the same stratosphere as Seattle's. Stafford dealt with a solid amount of pressure and was sacked four times on the night. There was also a period against the Bears where he and the Rams punted six times over a seven-drive stretch. Chicago simply didn't take advantage. Seattle can, and will, especially if Kenneth Walker III gets rolling on the ground.\" Pick: Seahawks 30, Rams 20To see Sullivan's AFC Championship pick, click here.John Breech's Rams vs. Seahawks pickRams +2.5: \"The Seahawks only lost three games all year and all three of those games had one big thing in common: They turned the ball over multiple times. The Seahawks are so good that they only tend to lose when they beat themselves: They went 9-0 this season when their turnover number was one or zero, but they went 6-3  when they turned the ball over two times or more. \"The problem for the Seahawks is that if there's anyone who might turn the ball over multiple times in a big game, it's definitely Sam Darnold, especially if that game is against the Rams. In two games against L.A. this season, Darnold has been picked off six times. \n\"Darnold had the most turnovers by any player in the NFL this year with 20 (14 interceptions, six lost fumbles). Since 1990, only one QB has led the NFL in turnovers and won the Super Bowl in the same year, and that was Eli Manning, who did it thanks to a miracle run by the Giants in 2007. \"Darnold has faced the Rams four times since the beginning of last season and here's what has happened: He's been sacked 16 times, he's thrown seven interceptions and he's gone 1-3.\" Pick: Rams 30, Seahawks 23To see Breech's AFC Championship pick, click here.Mike McClure's top DFS for Championship SundayIf you want to add some DFS lineups to your Championship Sunday, Mike McClure is the expert you'll want to follow.

The Seahawks have an elite defense and home-field advantage, but when two teams are as close in quality as these two are, I always like to roll with whichever team has the advantage at quarterback, the game's most important position.

Everyone is going to be on the Seahawks this week because of their incredible defense, but I will remind you that Matthew Stafford and Co. racked up 581 yards of total offense and 37 points in that overtime thriller in Seattle we witnessed last month. This pick comes down to me trusting Stafford and his fantastic cast of weapons more than Sam Darnold. The historical trends are in my favor as well. The Rams are 2-0 all-time vs. the Seahawks in the playoffs, and have won four straight NFC Championship game appearances.\"I know scoring points against this Seahawks defense will be tough. The only touchdowns they've allowed since Thanksgiving, not including the Rams matchup, are a Philip Rivers passing touchdown and a Bryce Young rushing touchdown. Still, I'm calling for the upset. Sean McVay is 5-2 against the spread and 4-3 straight up as an underdog in the playoffs.\" Pick: Rams 24, Seahawks 23\nTo see Dajani's AFC Championship pick, click here.\n            ",

The Seahawks blasted the Niners, 41-6, in a game that was never remotely close after Rashid Shaheed took the opening kickoff to the house for a touchdown. The Seahawks are now in the conference title game for the first time since 2014, when they went to back-to-back Super Bowls during the \"Legion of Boom\" era.Los Angeles is coming off a dramatic, overtime victory over the Chicago Bears in the divisional round, which followed a similarly dramatic win over the Carolina Panthers on Wild Card Weekend. The Rams have won their two playoff games by a combined six points, but they've advanced to the title game nonetheless. They were last here back in the 2021 season, when Matthew Stafford led the team to its first Super Bowl since 1999, and now they're looking to get back to the same mountaintop.Which of these two teams will advance to the Super Bowl and earn a chance to compete for the Lombardi Trophy? We'll find out soon enough. Before we detail some key storylines, here's a look at how you can watch the game.Where to watch Seahawks vs. Rams liveDate: Sunday, Jan. 25 | Time: 6:30 p.m. ETLocation: Lumen Field (Seattle)TV: Fox | Streaming: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Seahawks -2.5, O/U 46.5 via DraftKings Sportsbook\nKey StorylinesGrudge match. The Rams beat the Seahawks in the first of the teams' two regular-season meetings, prevailing 21-19, a game in which their defense forced four interceptions from Sam Darnold. The Seahawks won the second game in dramatic fashion in overtime, converting a pair of two-point tries along the way as they stormed back from a 30-14 fourth-quarter deficit and got themselves the inside track to the No. 1 seed that allows them to host this conference title game. Sam Darnold vs. Chris Shula. Darnold had a miserable time against Shula's defense in the playoffs last year and in the first matchup of this season. He went 25 of 40 for 245 yards, one touchdown and one interception while taking an incredible nine sacks in last year's playoff game. He went 29 of 44 for 279 yards and the aforementioned four picks in the first matchup this season. And in the first three quarters of the second matchup this season, he went 10 of 16 for 126 yards and another pick. But he went off in the fourth quarter and overtime of that second game, completing 12 of 18 passes for 144 yards, two scores and a pick (and the game-winning two-point conversion in OT) to lead the team back from its 16-point deficit. The Seahawks need more of the latter version of Darnold than the former if they want to stave off the Rams again. The Rams' secondary can be leaky on occasion, so it's likely a matter of keeping Darnold well protected, giving him time to make the right decisions rather than rushing and becoming more susceptible to mistakes.Matthew Stafford vs. Mike Macdonald. Stafford largely struggled in the first matchup between these two teams this season, going just 15 of 28 for 130 yards (a season-low average of 4.6 per attempt), albeit while throwing a pair of touchdowns and no picks. But he went nuclear in the second matchup, throwing for 457 yards and three scores while completing 29 of 49 pass attempts. He didn't take a sack or turn the ball over in either game. With Puka Nacua and Davante Adams on the outside, he has the tools to succeed against even one of the best defenses in the NFL, which is exactly what the Seahawks are. If Macdonald can contain Stafford as he did in the first matchup, the Seahawks have a chance to win -- even if that's not what happened in that particular game. But if Stafford goes off again as he did in the second matchup, the Seahawks might not get the miracle comeback this time around. Zach Charbonnet injury. The Seahawks will be down a man in the backfield after Charbonnet tore his ACL last week against San Francisco. That leaves Kenneth Walker III as the feature back for Seattle. George Holani could potentially return from injured reserve, but if he doesn't, then it'll be Velus Jones Jr. and Cam Akers working behind Walker. That would likely mean a significant workload for Walker, who has been splitting the snaps and touches with Charbonnet all season. Charbonnet has been the preferred goalline back for Seattle, so it'll be interesting to see whether Walker assumes that role or if it goes to one of the other backs active for the game.Rams running game. Kyren Williams carried the ball 12 times for 91 yards and a touchdown in the first matchup between these two teams. Blake Corum, though, got only 10 yards on his 8 carries. Still, 20 rushes for 101 yards is excellent. Williams and Corum combined for 118 yards on 37 rushing attempts in the second game, though, getting bottled up a little bit more than they did in the first contest. have run for at least 111 yards in each of their two playoff games, but Williams and Corum averaging a combined 4.0 yards per carry, which probably won't cut it against an elite Seattle run defense that held enemy backs to 3.7 yards a pop during the regular season.PredictionI picked the Rams to beat the Seahawks in the NFC title game in our pre-playoff predictions, so I am obviously rolling with the same pick here. L.A. won the first game between these two teams and should have won the second one, and would have if not for one of the craziest two-point conversions anyone has ever seen. The Seahawks have an elite defense and home-field advantage, but when two teams are as close in quality as these two are, I always like to roll with whichever team has the advantage at quarterback, the game's most important position. In this case, that's Matthew Stafford and the Rams. I like them to advance with a closely contested win. \nPick: Rams 23, Seahawks 20\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        The start of a new year can mean only one thing around these parts: it's time to analyze and rank an unhealthy amount of minor-league prospects. Such is the tradition here at CBS Sports, but while we're upholding that tradition, be aware that we're making some changes to our approach by ranking the top 20 prospects per division, however that breaks down by team. Our belief is that those tweaks will make the coverage better by making it easier for fans to compare how their future players stack up against their top rivals. These rankings are formed through firsthand observational and statistical analysis; conversations with scouts, analysts, and player development specialists; and an understanding of historical trends. Add in some biases toward and against certain player types and, on occasion, a tiebreaking coin flip, and you have a general idea about how we put these lists together.Below, you'll find the National League West rankings. Perhaps predictably, the Dodgers lead the way by virtue of employing eight of the 20 prospects. That group includes three of the top four and six of the top 11. Josue De Paula, Eduardo Quintero, and Zyhir Hope probably won't factor into this season, but they could provide Los Angeles with an impressive outfield over the coming years.The weakest farm system in the NL West belongs to the Rockies. They have just two players on the list; neither cracked the top 10. First baseman Charlie Condon has disappointed since draft night 2024, while shortstop Ethan Holliday has to answer some serious concerns about his game over the coming months. It's no wonder the Rockies find themselves under new management.\nLet's get down to business and break down the rest of the NL West's prospect class.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Josue De Paula, OF, DodgersThe quick hook: Cleanup hitter in the makingMLB ETA: Summer 2027De Paula remains just a few tweaks away from emerging as a monster middle-of-the-order bat. His age (he'll turn 21 in May) and the Dodgers' sterling player development reputation makes it easier to take the leap of faith. He's a well-constructed lefty hitter with big-time power and a borderline passive approach at the plate. Unlike some of his organizational peers, he doesn't swing and miss at high rates. Rather, the areas of concern for De Paula entail him better leveraging his strength by lifting the ball more frequently and his long-term defensive value (he may end up at DH). The Dodgers once traded Yordan Alvarez. De Paula may give them a second crack at that skill set. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. Eduardo Quintero, OF, DodgersThe quick hook: Yet another promising Dodgers outfielderMLB ETA: Summer 2028Quintero celebrated his 20th birthday in September as he was putting the finishing touches on a season that saw him hit .293/.415/.508 with 19 home runs and 47 stolen bases split between A-ball affiliates. Despite his youth, he already has a feel for making loud contact while running an 80% contact rate. Quintero's approach is borderline passive, but that's about the biggest knock you're going to find here.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Bryce Eldridge, 1B, GiantsThe quick hook: Big man, big power, big whiffMLB ETA: Already debutedEldridge is a 6-foot-7 first baseman, and you know what that means. He combines massive strength (he had a hard-hit rate over 60% between Triple-A and the majors) with legitimate swing-and-miss concerns (especially against breaking balls). Such is life for most players this size. Eldridge has had his share of issues with left-handers (no surprise given the previous parenthetical), suggesting that he may be best deployed as part of a timeshare. He should see plenty of time in the majors in 2026 and he should eventually record San Francisco's second 30-homer season since the Barry Bonds days.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Zyhir Hope, OF, DodgersThe quick hook: Power and walks for days, but strikeout creep a factorMLB ETA: Summer 2027Hope, the best part of the return on Michael Busch, batted .266/.376/.428 with 13 home runs and 27 stolen bases while spending most of the year in High-A. He's a physical left-handed hitter with clear loft to his swing. He knows how to lift and pull the ball, which is a good thing given his innate strength. Hope also possesses a patient approach that, when married to his swing-and-miss tendencies (he connected on fewer than 70% of his swings in High-A), could result in an uncomfortably high strikeout rate. A larger sample of him in Double-A should reveal just how high.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Ryan Waldschmidt, OF, DiamondbacksThe quick hook: Quality, if unusual corner batMLB ETA: Summer 2026Waldschmidt was an analytics darling heading into the 2024 Draft, but he slipped to No. 31 because of an odd swing that sees him barely stride before he launches. He's since put some of those aesthetic concerns to sleep with a strong introduction to the professional ranks. In fact, last season he hit .289/.419/.473 with nearly as many walks as strikeouts split between High- and Double-A. Waldschmidt has sneaky athleticism, but he's likely ticked for a corner at the game's highest level. Still, there's enough here to project him as an above-average hitter who could arrive before the season is out.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Kruz Schoolcraft, LHP, PadresThe quick hook: Massive lefty with two-way backgroundMLB ETA: Summer 2029Schoolcraft drew comparisons to Giants prospect Bryce Eldridge as an amateur based on size (he's listed at 6-foot-8) and their two-way potential. Whereas Eldridge has focused on hitting as a professional, Schoolcraft's future is on the mound. He's able to generate a flatter plane than his power forward frame suggests he should and he's shown promising velocity (touching into the upper 90s) and feel for secondaries (a changeup and a slider). He's one to keep tabs on.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Ethan Salas, C, PadresThe quick hook: Extremely young backstop whose ascent has slowedMLB ETA: Spring 2027As recently as 18 months ago, Salas looked destined to become MLB's first teenage catcher since Iván Rodríguez. Unfortunately, he's no longer assured of that fate. He followed up a disappointing 2024 campaign by missing almost the entire year on account of a back injury. The perfect world outcome here remains a strong defensive backstop who offers enough offense to start most days. Given that Salas won't turn 20 until June, it's fair to remain hopeful that he can reach that projection -- even if it's going to take more time than was originally expected. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    8. Emil Morales, SS, DodgersThe quick hook: Powerful infielder overshadowed in deep systemMLB ETA: Summer 2028Morales spent most of last season as an 18-year-old, but he already looks like a thumper in the making. The combination of his 6-foot-3 frame, his loft-heavy swing, and his actual output (a handful of his 14 home runs last season exited to center or right field) makes it clear that power will carry his game. As for everything else? Well, his contact rate was on the wrong side of 70% and his size may necessitate a move to the hot corner in due time. In a lot of other systems, he'd be the crown jewel. With the Dodgers, he's not even among the top three most enticing young hitters.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    9. Slade Caldwell, OF, DiamondbacksThe quick hook: Short, speedy outfielder who needs to swing moreMLB ETA: Summer 2028Caldwell is your standard issue Diamondbacks outfield prospect. He's listed at just 5-foot-9, but he's fast and he's shown more thump in the past than you'd anticipate thanks to his feel for lifting and pulling. That last part wasn't on display in his first professional season, as he put the ball on the carpet more than 50% of the time. To make matters worse, Caldwell employed a laughably passive approach, swinging about a third of the pitches he saw. (For context, Juan Soto had the lowest swing rate among qualified hitters, and even he made an attempt at a 35% clip.) He was technically an above-average performer all the same, but he's going to need to let 'er rip more often as he progresses through the minors.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    10. Mike Sirota, OF, DodgersThe quick hook: Nifty trade acquisition who could start most daysMLB ETA: Summer 2027Sirota has been on prospect radars since he was known as a big-swing, small-school outfielder at Northeastern. The Reds popped him in the third round of the 2024 Draft, but they sent him to the Dodgers that offseason in exchange for Gavin Lux. That looks like another savvy move by the Dodgers, since Sirota spent last year hitting .333/.452/.616 across A-ball affiliates before hurting his knee on a slide in early July. He possesses a patient, maybe even passive, approach and above-average juice and athleticism. Sirota did swing and miss a lot, so keep an eye on that dynamic as he continues to climb the ladder.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    11. Alex Freeland, SS, DodgersThe quick hook: Quality infielder without a clear roleMLB ETA: Already debutedThe state of the Dodgers' roster and player development machine is such that they're able to bring up prospects like Freeland and Daulton Rushing, who would be Day One starters for most other organizations, and deploy them in reserve roles. It's to be seen how Freeland, a switch-hitter with discipline and pop (particularly against right-handed pitchers) fits onto the 2026 roster. He should be part of it, though, because he doesn't have anything left to prove in the minors.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    12. Charlie Condon, 1B, RockiesThe quick hook: Disappointing righty batMLB ETA: Summer 2026Condon was a legitimate candidate to go No. 1 overall in the 2024 Draft thanks to a well-rounded offensive game that featured contact, on-base, and slugging upside. He instead went third and then had a dismal introduction to pro ball for someone with a successful SEC vetting to his credit. He had an improved first full year, batting .268/.376/.444 with 14 home runs split between High- and Double-A. There are still some discouraging aspects to his game, including how the Rockies used him primarily at first base. That puts more pressure on his bat, which may not be a good thing. Condon whiffed on nearly 30% of his swings and most of his hardest contact came at low-flying trajectories. Maybe the new Rockies regime can help unlock the version of Condon that drew comparisons to Kris Bryant?\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    13. Ethan Holliday, SS, RockiesThe quick hook: The most famous player in last year's class has upside, downsideMLB ETA: Spring 2029It was only fitting that Holliday was selected by the same franchise that chose his father Matt 27 years prior. Will this decision work out as well as that one did? There's reason to be skeptical. Holliday the Younger has power and discipline working in his favor, but the amount of swing and miss in his game could sabotage the entire operation. (There's no sense reading too much into an 18-game sample, particularly when it represents a player's introduction to pro ball, but he whiffed on more than 40% of his swings in the California League.) The Rockies played Holliday exclusively at shortstop, but scouts believe he'll eventually move to the hot corner. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    14. Josuar Gonzalez, SS, GiantsThe quick hook: One to dream onMLB ETA: Summer 2029The Giants inked Gonzalez for nearly $3 million last January. In time, that may register as a franchise-altering decision. Gonzalez is a switch-hitting shortstop who hit .288/.404/.455 with more walks than strikeouts in his introduction to professional baseball. Not bad for someone who just celebrated his 18th birthday in October. He's a long ways off, but there's a chance for him to develop into a five-tool player (albeit in the sense that he has average or better marks in each) if all goes well.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    15. Humberto Cruz, RHP, PadresThe quick hook: Promising young right-handerMLB ETA: Summer 2028Cruz is a shorter right-hander who logged six appearances in the California League as an 18-year-old, compiling a 6.97 ERA and a 2.22 strikeout-to-walk ratio. Those marks may not be impressive, but he has a flowering three-pitch mix (including a hot fastball) and he projects to develop at least average command. Cruz's youth and the general attrition rate for young right-handed pitchers means you should apply generous error bars to his potential outcomes. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    16. Bo Davidson, OF, GiantsThe quick hook: Former undrafted free agent closing in on MLB debutMLB ETA: Late summer 2026Davidson is a great story: a nondrafted free agent who the Giants signed for five figures in 2023. He's already outperformed any realistic expectations they could have had, hitting .281/.376/.468 with 18 home runs and 19 stolen bases split between High- and Double-A. Davidson, a lefty batter, has shown power to all fields and connected on more than 74% of his swings in 2025. He has had some platoon issues throughout his career, but developing into a most-days option in a corner is a massive scouting and development win for an organization that could use some more of those.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    17. Demetrio Crisantes, INF, DiamondbacksThe quick hook: Bat-first infielder who needs better healthMLB ETA: Spring 2028Crisantes, a seventh-round find out of Nogales, Ari., can really hit thanks to a simple right-handed swing. In 34 games last season, he batted .252/.358/.415 with more walks than strikeouts. Alas, Crisantes' year ended in mid-May when he required shoulder surgery to repair a torn labrum. Availability is often referred to as the sixth tool. So far, it's one that Crisantes lacks. Since being plucked in 2022, he's appeared in just 155 regular-season contests. If he can stay hearty and hale, he should hit his way to the majors quicker than the above estimate.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    18. Kayson Cunningham, SS, DiamondbacksThe quick hook: Lefty middle infielder with contact, disciplineMLB ETA: Spring 2029Cunningham, the 18th pick in last summer's draft, was one of the most polished prep bats in the class. He has an appreciable feel for contact and the strike zone alike from the left side. Scouts also project him to stick on the dirt, albeit probably not at shortstop. There were two main drawbacks to his game: 1) he was already 19 on draft night, putting him on the older side for a prep player; and 2) he has a lack of oomph that could cause both his hit tool and his approach to play down. It's up to Cunningham and the Diamondbacks to do what they can to prevent that outcome from being realized.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    19. James Tibbs III, OF, DodgersThe quick hook: Well-traveled outfielder with solid base of skillsMLB ETA: Summer 2027Tibbs has moved around a lot more than you would expect for someone who was drafted in the top half of the first round not yet two years ago. First, the Giants sent him to the Red Sox as part of the Rafael Devers trade. Then, the Red Sox shipped him to the Dodgers in the Dustin May deal. Through it all, he hit .243/.373/.429 with 20 home runs and 10 stolen bases. It's only fair to have some skepticism when a player bounces around like this, but on paper he has a decent combination of contact, discipline, and strength -- and, as an added bonus, he's already demonstrated competency against Double-A competition. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    20. River Ryan, RHP, DodgersThe quick hook: Talented righty with terrible health track recordMLB ETA: Already debutedRyan is, at 27, the oldest player on any of these lists. He's thrown fewer than 200 innings as a professional, including a grand total of zero in 2025 after undergoing Tommy John surgery. Yet he's on here anyway because his arm talent is that good. The last time anyone saw Ryan play, he was working with a six-pitch arsenal led by a mid-to-upper-90s fastball, three breaking balls, and a changeup that featured some sink. He's shown he can throw strikes and generate ground balls. He just has to stay healthy. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Nearly one-fourth of college football's FBS programs will be led by a new coach in 2026, including more than a dozen as headliners at Power Four schools. Playoff expansion has turned up the pressure to win quickly, along with a revitalized NIL and revenue-sharing era funneling resources into rapidly changing rosters from the transfer portal.Gone are the days of setting foundations at various programs in Year 1 with player development in mind. Now, coaching staffs are taking with intention to win immediately, knowing the clock could restart in a couple of seasons if substantial progress fails to show.Here's a look at the 17 new head-coaching hires across the Power Four conference ranks, slotted into tiers based on both short- and long-term expectations.Immediate turnaround expected\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    LSUNew coach: Lane KiffinIt's impossible to ignore what Kiffin has done in Baton Rouge since his arrival, swiping several of the nation's top transfers with highly-contested NIL wins to boast college football's top recruiting class overall. This isn't a multi-year plan for the Tigers -- it's win now and win big. LSU poached Ole Miss defensive playmaker Princewill Umanmielen on Wednesday, already signed top-ranked quarterback Sam Leavitt and former Florida pass-catcher Eugene Wilson III and is trying to land five-star Colorado offensive tackle Jordan Seaton. Kiffin's going for the biggest fish in the pond and hooking his share. LSU moved on from its previous coach because 10-win seasons weren't enough. Annual playoff appearances are coming quickly with Kiffin in tow.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Oklahoma StateNew coach: Eric MorrisThis situation is graded a bit differently than others considering Oklahoma State's all-time faceplant at 1-11 in 2025. An \"immediate turnaround\" in Stillwater would be bowl-eligibility and that should happen with 54 transfers -- the most in college football. Morris brought his top talent from North Texas, including quarterback Drew Mestemaker and ballcarrier Caleb Hawkins, who combined for 64 total touchdowns last season. If there's a program following the Curt Cignetti doormat-to-elite recipe with a sizable chance to shine, this one's it.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Virginia TechNew coach: James FranklinThe Hokies have made a sizable investment into transforming themselves back into a national power and Franklin was one of the best hires this cycles to orchestrate this immediate reload. He was one of the biggest dominoes within the Power ranks after spending 12 seasons with Penn State, most of which were elite, including a playoff semifinal appearance in 2024. The spotlight won't be as hot at Virginia Tech and Franklin no longer has to deal with Ohio State and Michigan annually, not to mention the meteoric rises of Oregon and Indiana. Like others this cycle, Franklin's Year 1 two-deep at Virginia Tech will be primarily made up of his former players at Penn State.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    MichiganNew coach: Kyle WhittinghamGive Michigan credit for big-game hunting and getting this done swiftly following the firing of Sherrone Moore. Michigan under Whittingham should blast off like a rocket ship given his attention to detail and track record as a winner. Convincing Bryce Underwood to return at quarterback was the top priority and bringing Jason Beck over to overhaul the offense means -- for the first time in years -- to expect explosive production in Ann Arbor. Moore didn't leave the cupboard bare in terms of talent and the Wolverines should be able to compete for a possible playoff trip in 2026.\nGive it a year or two\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Ole MissNew coach: Pete GoldingOle Miss would've likely been placed in a lower category had Golding not offered an elite early look with a three-game sample size in this season's College Football Playoff. His first three games as coach were quite impressive and set the bar extremely high for 2026 and beyond. It's hard to fathom Ole Miss repeating that level of success in his first full campaign unless quarterback Trinidad Chambliss wins his lawsuit against the NCAA for another year and portal acquisitions are immediate home runs. Standout running back Kewan Lacy will handle the heavy lifting offensively in John David Baker's revised scheme.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Penn StateNew coach: Matt CampbellPenn State landed 36 transfers, a complete roster overhaul under Campbell with nearly two dozen of those guys coming over from Iowa State. This is essentially the Penn State Cyclones next season until the new regime figures out its recruiting plan for the foreseeable future. It's a top-5 transfer class in Happy Valley, but numerous players lost during the mass exodus at the end of the season are not replaceable, namely defensive end Chaz Coleman (Tennessee), fellow pass rusher rusher Zuriah Fisher (USC) and cornerback AJ Harris (Indiana).\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    FloridaNew coach: Jon SumrallThere was a ton of moving and shaking within the SEC carousel as Florida missed out on the Kiffin sweepstakes with Tulane coach Sumrall behind door No. 2. His staff additions have made a lot of sense and Sumrall got creative at previous stops en route to a 78.1 winning percentage as a head coach. Florida vetted numerous candidates after firing Billy Napier and it feels like athletic director Scott Stricklin got this one right. The Gators must be willing to give Sumrall somewhat of a runway after making their fifth hire since Urban Meyer.\nIntriguing despite challenges\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    AuburnNew coach: Alex GoleshQuarterback Byrum Brown is one of 13 former USF starters to follow Golesh to The Plains, giving Auburn reason for optimism next season. Golesh's decision to retain D.J. Durkin is a net-positive for Auburn, which should be stout on the defensive side of the football. Golesh has obvious previous SEC experience as a play-caller at Tennessee, but it's a different animal when you're in charge. At times with the Bulls (23-15 overall the last three seasons), Golesh's teams played down to competition before posting a couple ranked wins in 2025. Consistency is key for Golesh as Auburn's new coach considering the previous two program leaders who followed Gus Malzahn were both fired within three years.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Kansas StateNew coach: Collin KleinChris Klieman stepped away at Kansas State because he was growing tired of incessant player demands, NIL disadvantages and roster retention headaches in college football's new era. By comparison, the 36-year-old Klein -- who called plays at Texas A&M last season -- welcomes that burden as a first-time head coach. A program alumnus, Klein hopes to paint a similar picture of what Klieman left with the Wildcats after following program legend Bill Snyder in 2019. Kansas State's not expecting annual playoff appearances, but getting back to the top third of the Big 12 is important.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    KentuckyNew coach: Will SteinIt would be unwise to overlook Kentucky and what it's been doing this offseason under Stein, the award-winning former Oregon offensive coordinator. For the first time in the transfer era, Kentucky is paying for top-end talent and has secured a wealth of immediate starters over the last few weeks, including former Texas running back CJ Baxter, Tennessee offensive tackle Lance Heard and Notre Dame quarterback Kevin Minchey, a former four-star signee in South Bend who lost the competition to freshman CJ Carr this season. This roster, at least on paper, is the best Kentucky's had in years.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Iowa StateNew coach: Jimmy RogersRogers is now at a program that will do what it can to meet his demands and provide resources to build something special at Iowa State -- luxuries he didn't possess during his one season with Washington State. Rogers was dealt a bad hand with the Cougars and still got to bowl season, his team showing their best against top teams last fall. Iowa State AD Jamie Pollard identified Rogers quickly and moved to get his guy, which is becoming increasingly hard to do in college football and should be commended.Could crash and burn quickly\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Arkansas New coach: Ryan SilverfieldOne of the shakiest searches within the SEC this cycle belongs to the Razorbacks, who are praying Silverfield can rejuvenate a program that's fallen on hard times against an increasingly challenging schedule every year. Silverfield, who won 50 games at Memphis over six seasons with one nationally-ranked finish, signed a 40-player transfer class ahead of his first season. Nearly half of those newcomers are from the Group of Five ranks, including seven Tigers. Previous Arkansas coach Sam Pittman harped on how difficult it was to compete in the NIL era and despite Silverfield's situation at Memphis being one of the Group of Five's most attractive, he might endure similar headaches in Fayetteville.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Michigan StateNew coach: Pat FitzgeraldThe game has changed considerably since Fitzgerald last coached a game inside the Big Ten. And after the Spartans quickly pulled the plug on outgoing coach Jonathan Smith, there's no guarantee that Fitzgerald's leash will be long enough to see this through in East Lansing. It's definitely a rebuild since Michigan State's primary rivals in the conference have lapped the Spartans the last few seasons. He's a no-nonsense kind of coach who prides himself on physicality and execution. Fitzgerald needs to find players with a similar makeup.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    CaliforniaNew coach: Tosh LupoiDan Lanning raved about his former defensive coordinator and believes he'll bring stability to California. Lupoi's offensive coordinator hire of Jordan Somerville is an interesting one after the two worked together at Oregon. Somerville has spent the last three years as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' quarterbacks coach and helped Baker Mayfield soar to new highs as a pro. That said, Lupoi will not have the same talent pool he helped develop in Eugene at a difficult place to win within the ACC.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    UCLANew coach: Bob ChesneyShould UCLA's decision-makers get the benefit of the doubt after their last hire of Deshaun Foster was one of the worst in program history? Chesney followed Cignetti at James Madison and got the Dukes to the playoff this season, but does not have Power Four experience. UCLA's 41-player transfer class is one of the biggest in the country and Chesney will use that to combat a challenging slate in the Big Ten next fall. He's an up-and-comer in the profession whose momentum may begin to slow if the Bruins fail to look the part early.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    UtahNew coach: Morgan ScalleyThere's not many needle-movers in this 14-player transfer reload for the Utes after Whittingham's departure to Michigan, but retaining some of their best players was the top priority and they managed to check that box. Quarterback Devan Dampier is back, along with freshman playmaker Byrd Ficklin. It'll be interesting to see how Utah's offense looks under new hire Kevin McGiven, who replaces Jason Beck after he left for the Wolverines. Scalley has to keep Utah as a line-of-scrimmage-first program, or this could go in another direction entirely -- especially since he's following a legend.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    StanfordNew coach: Tavita Pritchard The former NFL assistant started at quarterback for the Cardinal before Andrew Luck took over in 2009 and now, Stanford's new general manager of the football program who led the hiring process believes he has found his diamond. Stanford's last winning season came in 2020 and Pritchard's success will depend on the investment boosters are willing to make into football within the ACC. This hire could go one of two ways with no in-between -- a failure of epic proportions or a stabilizing choice that puts Stanford in the top-25 conversion.\n            ",

I think Payton is one of the best play callers in the league, so I think he will.\"On the other side, Drake Maye will be making his first road playoff start for the Patriots. That can be daunting, especially against a good Denver defense. But Maye has been good on the road this season. Then again, this is the playoffs.\"The Bills ran on the Broncos last week, so I expect the Patriots to try to do the same. New England is averaging 156.1 rushing yards per game over the last seven games, but I think Denver will be better this time against the run.\n\"It would be easy to pick the Pats here based on Stidham playing. But I think the Denver players will elevate their games around him and Payton will have a big day calling the game for him. I think Denver's defense will get the best of the Pats offense.

The SportsLine expert has been on a tear with his NFL picks, owning a 58-38-2 record (+1589) over his last 98 NFL plays. Now, he's turned his attention to this playoff matchup between New England and Denver. We can tell you Marshall is leaning Over the 42.5 point total, but to see his official ATS pick, you'll need to go to SportsLine.Tyler Sullivan's Patriots vs. Broncos pickPatriots -5.5: \"Will Stidham rise to the occasion and pull off what would be a historic upset? I doubt it. One of the underrated developments of these playoffs has been the rise of New England's defense. Once thought to live and die by the performance of Drake Maye, the Patriots have won back-to-back playoff matchups even as their MVP-contending quarterback hasn't played his best wire to wire. That's largely been due to the defense, which is coming off a dominating win over Houston, where it accounted for five turnovers. If the Patriots' defense makes Stidham's head spin even half as much as they C.J. Stroud's, they should punch their ticket to the Super Bowl rather convincingly. Oh, and if you are concerned about New England going on the road, let's factor this in: the Patriots were the only team in the NFL to boast a perfect 8-0 record on the road this season and were also 7-1 ATS in those contests.\" Pick: Patriots 24, Broncos 17\nTo see Sullivan's NFC Championship pick, click here.John Breech's Patriots vs. Broncos pickBroncos +5.5: \"Maye struggled against one of the best defenses in the NFL, and now, he has to once again play one of the best defenses in the NFL, except this time, he has to go on the road. Maye has taken a beating this postseason (he's been sacked 10 times in two games) and it could get worse this week. He took the fourth-most sacks in the NFL this year and he's facing a defense that recorded the FIFTH-MOST sacks in a single season in NFL history. I have no idea how the Patriots offensive line is going to stop the Broncos' pass-rush. \"When Maye starts taking hits, he tends to fumble the ball. He's fumbled SIX times in his two playoff games and the Patriots have lost three of those fumbles. The Broncos are 9-1 this season when they force at least one turnover, so something as simple as recovering a fumble could be the key to pulling off the upset here. \"Stidham might only throw for 103 yards in this game, but if he plays mistake-free football and doesn't turn the ball over, Denver will have a chance to win.\" Pick: Patriots 20, Broncos 17\nTo see Breech's NFC Championship pick, click here.Mike McClure's top DFS for Championship SundayIf you want to add some DFS lineups to your Championship Sunday, Mike McClure is the expert you'll want to follow.

To see the rest of his top plays and lineups, click over to SportsLine. Jared Dubin's Patriots vs. Broncos pickPatriots -5.5: \"This one is pretty simple: the Broncos will not have their starting quarterback for this game. It's really hard to see them putting together a representative offensive performance with Jarrett Stidham at the helm -- especially given how well the New England defense has played so far during the playoffs in holding down offenses piloted by Justin Herbert and C.J. Stroud. New England's offense hasn't exactly lit the world on fire in either of its games against elite defenses, and the Broncos present another one for them to go up against, but I have far more trust in Drake Maye going against a Denver unit that has actually shown some leaks since its bye week, than I do in Stidham and Co. against the Pats.\" Pick: Patriots 21, Broncos 10To see Dubin's NFC Championship pick, click here.Jordan Dajani's Patriots vs. Broncos pickPatriots -5.5: \"Stidham is the seventh quarterback to make his first start of the season in the playoffs, and only one of the previous six actually won their game. He is 1-3 as an NFL starter, and it will be interesting to see how Sean Payton alters his game plan with Bo Nix out. Regardless of Stidham's role on Sunday, there are two things that must happen if the Broncos want this upset: The run game has to reappear and the defense has to dominate. Since J.K. Dobbins was injured in Week 10, the Broncos rank bottom 10 in rushing yards per game and yards per rush. Dobbins has a chance to return this week, but I'm not banking on him to be an X factor. This Denver defense ranks top three in points allowed per game (18.3), yards allowed per game (278.2) and third-down percentage (33.8%) as well. Vance Joseph's unit can definitely contain Drake Maye, but the Patriots are the only team with a perfect against-the-spread record (8-0) on the road this season. I believe this will be a close game until New England finally covers in the fourth quarter.\" Pick: Patriots 20, Broncos 13\nTo see Dajani's NFC Championship pick, click here.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        We are one Sunday of football away from finding out what the 2025 NFL season's Super Bowl LX matchup will be.Conference championship Sunday kicks off with Drake Maye's second-seeded New England Patriots facing the top-seeded Denver Broncos and their NFL-best pass rush in the AFC title game. Maye is looking to become the second-youngest quarterback to start a Super Bowl at the age of 23, and the Broncos are trying to become the first team since the 1992 Buffalo Bills to win playoff games with two different starting quarterbacks in the same postseason. Over in the NFC, Matthew Stafford's fifth-seeded Los Angeles Rams will face Sam Darnold's top-seeded Seattle Seahawks for the third time this season. Stafford is trying to join John Elway (1998 season), Peyton Manning (2015 season) and Tom Brady (four times) as the fourth quarterback to start a Super Bowl at the age of 38 or older. Darnold is aiming to become the third quarterback to start a Super Bowl after leading the NFL in turnovers in the regular season. The only other two to do it are Jim Kelly in the 1992 season and Eli Manning in the 2007 season. What stunning event could occur in the AFC and NFC championship games? Let's cook up some with five bold predictions for the NFL's final four.   \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Rams upset Seahawks at Lumen Field to win NFC by multiple scoresThere's never been a playoff matchup like the fifth-seeded Los Angeles Rams and the top-seeded Seattle Seahawks. With the Rams winning 21-19 at SoFi Stadium in Week 11 and the Seahawks soaring back 38-37 in overtime at Lumen Field in Week 16, Sunday's NFC Championship game will be the first interdivisional playoff matchup in NFL history where both regular season meetings were decided by two or fewer points, according to CBS Sports Research. Los Angeles outscored Seattle by one point (58-57) and outgained them by a single yard (830-829) in the 2025 regular season. It literally could not be a tight, more competitive matchup. These two teams nearly played to a stalemate in the 2025 season. This game is also a matchup of the NFL's No. 1 scoring defense, the Seahawks unit that allowed an NFL-best 17.2 points per game, versus the NFL's No. 1 scoring offense, the Rams' attack that averaged an NFL-best 30.5 points per game. Strength versus strength with a trip to the Super Bowl on the line. However, the third matchup in the trilogy will be decided by multiple scores for the first time this season, and the two-and-a-half-point road underdog, odds via DraftKings Sportsbook, Rams will emerge victorious. Yes, the Seahawks are fresh off of tying their largest margin of victory in a playoff game in franchise history after the 41-6 demolition of the San Francisco 49ers. Yes, the Rams barely survived the Chicago Bears at Soldier Field, winning by just three points in overtime -- 20-17. Seattle had the fortune of playing a 49ers squad whose top six highest-paid players missed a combined 64 games including the playoffs, and a San Francisco team that overall had the most player games missed because of injuries among playoff teams this season, including the playoffs, at 287 per CBS Sports Research.\nThe Seahawks faced a version of the 49ers that had simply run out of gas. Meanwhile, the Rams escaped Chicago with head coach Sean McVay admitting he knew he didn't do a great job with the offensive play calling. McVay gets back in the lab this week and has 2025 first-team All-Pro quarterback Matthew Stafford and 2025 first-team All-Pro wide receiver Puka Nacua rolling once again. That leads to a game that looks like the Week 16 matchup in Seattle prior to Rashid Shaheed's punt return touchdown giving Seattle a jolt to make a rally. In that game, Los Angeles led 30-14 in the fourth quarter. The Rams don't let a lead like that slip through their fingers this time around. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Puka Nacua goes for over 100 yards receiving again vs. Seahawks Rams All-Pro wide receiver Puka Nacua has a combined 300 receiving yards against the Rams in their two regular season games this season, including a career-high 225-yard, two-touchdown performance in Week 16 on 12 catches. That included a go-ahead, 41-yard catch-and-run touchdown in overtime that gave Los Angeles a 37-30 lead. The Seahawks overcame that score by converting on a two-point conversion on their ensuing touchdown drive. Even though the Seahawks' No. 1 scoring defense has allowed just six touchdowns since Thanksgiving, seven games, four of the six came against the Rams in Week 16. The touchdowns they have allowed are as follows: three Matthew Stafford passing touchdowns (two to Nacua), a rushing touchdowns by Rams No. 2 running back Blake Corum, a touchdown pass by Indianapolis Colts quarterback Philip Rivers and a rushing touchdown by Carolina Panthers quarterback Bryce Young. \nNacua will be the sixth player in the 21st century to have over 200 receiving yards in a single game against an opponent and then face that same opponent in the playoffs. The other five were Cleveland Browns wide receiver Amari Cooper in 2023 (against the Houston Texans), Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase in 2021 (against the Kansas City Chiefs), Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Tyreek Hill in 2020 (against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers), New Orleans Saints wide receiver Michael Thomas in 2018 (against the Los Angeles Rams) and San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Anquan Boldin in 2013 (against the Green Bay Packers). The five prior to Nacua all had fewer than 75 receiving yards in the subsequent playoff rematch. Nacua will buck that trend and go for over 100 yards receiving against Seattle in this playoff rematch. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Sam Darnold doesn't turn the ball over vs. the Rams Sam Darnold continued his 2024 resurgence he had with the Minnesota Vikings into 2025 with the Seattle Seahawks. There's no denying that. However, he led the NFL with 20 turnovers in the 2025 regular season, and he has struggled with Rams defensive coordinator Chris Shula's defense across his last three games against Los Angeles dating to the 2024 NFC wild card round with the Vikings. That night, Darnold absorbed an NFL playoff-record nine sacks in a 27-9 defeat. \nFast forward to today, and Darnold has an oblique injuy. He wasn't nearly as mobile in the pocket in Seattle's 41-6 divisional round win against the San Francisco 49ers because of the ailment. On the Seahawks injury report, he was a limited practice participant because of that injury on both Wednesday and Thursday this week. Given his history against the Rams and his current health situation, it would seem like he's primed for more turnovers against the Rams especially since he's tossed six interceptions against them in two games this season. However, Darnold will overcome the past and present to play turnover-free football on Sunday. Sam Darnold's last three games vs. Rams, span begins in 2024 wild card round with VikingsStatsCompletion pct64.4%Pass TD-Turnovers3-8Passer rating67.5Times sacked13** Includes nine sacks in 2024 wild card round loss with Vikings, tied for the most in a playoff game in NFL history\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Drake Maye sacked no more than twice, doesn't fumble vs. Broncos' No. 1 pass rushNew England Patriots quarterback Drake Maye, the 2025 second-team All-Pro QB, has been sacked 57 times this season, including the playoffs. That's the second-most in the NFL ahead of only Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert's 60. Maye's 10 times sacked and 6 fumbles in the playoffs are both the most in the NFL this postseason. His six fumbles are the most by any player in the first two games of a postseason in the last 35 seasons, according to CBS Sports Research.Now, Maye and the Patriots will face the top-seeded Denver Broncos, whose 68 sacks led the NFL in the regular season. They also added three more against 2024 NFL MVP quarterback Josh Allen in a 33-30 overtime victory in the divisional round. Their pass rush is led by two-time Pro Bowl edge rusher Nik Bonitto, whose 14.0 sacks ranked as the fifth-most in the regular season and whose 19.1% quarterback pressure ranked as the third-best in the regular season, minimum 400 pass rushes. On paper, that's not an ideal matchup for 2025 fourth overall pick left tackle Will Campbell, a player whose three sacks allowed are the most in the NFL postseason and whose eight quarterback pressures allowed are tied for the most in the league in these playoffs. Maye is the 2025 second team All-Pro quarterback, so he'll be the fifth quarterback with an All-Pro on his resume Denver's defense has faced this season. The previous four they faced were Allen, Patrick Mahomes, Jalen Hurts and Dak Prescott. Denver combined to harass the four of them into more turnovers (seven) than total touchdowns (six).  All-Pro QBs vs. Broncos this season, including playoffsStatsW-L0-4Total TD-to-Turnovers6-7Yards per pass attempt 6.7Passer rating81.8Sacks taken14* All-Pro QBs: Patrick Mahomes, Josh Allen, Jalen Hurts, Dak Prescott (Maye: 2025 2nd-team All-Pro)Despite that, Maye will play a relatively clean game against the Broncos at Mile High because of his production when pressured and blitzed this season. He averages 5.5 yards per dropback when pressured, the second-most in the NFL, and he's registered an NFL-best touchdown-to-interception of 17-0 when blitzed this season, including the playoffs. That's the most touchdowns passes without an interception against the blitz by any quarterback in the last 10 seasons, according to CBS Sports Research. Denver blitzes at the fifth-highest rate in the NFL this season at 34%, and Maye will beat Bonitto, the Broncos' blitz and pass rush to be sacked no more than twice while playing fumble-free football. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Jarrett Stidham throws multiple TDs in first start of 2025 season With Broncos quarterback Bo Nix done for the season with a broken bone in his ankle, Denver is turning to Jarrett Stidham, who has just four career starts with the  last one coming in Week 18 of the 2023 season with the Broncos. That gives him the distinction of the fewest career starts by a quarterback set to start in a conference championship game all time, per CBS Sports Research. The previous record holder was New York Giants quarterback Jeff Hostetler's five entering the 1990 NFC Championship game. When Stidham drops back to pass on Sunday, it will mark his first pass attempt since that 2023 start. He played in three games in 2024 and just Week 8 against the Dallas Cowboys while up by 20 points. His four snaps in Week 8 were three handoffs and a kneel down. That's not great news ahead of facing a New England Patriots defense that has more wins (two) than touchdowns allowed this postseason (one). New England has the fewest touchdowns allowed through two playoff games in the last 25 playoffs, which is tied with the 2002 Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the 2006 Indianapolis Colts. Both of those previous squads did win the Super Bowl.However, Stidham will throw multiple touchdown passes on Sunday as some of his checkdowns get taken to the house by players like running back RJ Harvey and wide receiver Courtland Sutton. Harvey has racked up a touchdown in five of the last seven games including the postseason, and Sutton's 25 receiving touchdowns across the last three seasons are the sixth-most in the NFL. \n            ",

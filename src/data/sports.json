    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 college football bowl schedule features a Friday tripleheader, with the 2025 Rate Bowl serving as the middle matchup. It will see the Minnesota Golden Gophers (7-5) facing the New Mexico Lobos (9-3) in the programs' first-ever meeting. Minnesota is riding an eight-game bowl winning streak, which is the longest active in FBS and tied for the fourth-longest in history. New Mexico enters into the Rate Bowl 2025 on a six-game winning streak as this will be its first bowl game since 2016.Kickoff is at 4:30 p.m. ET from Chase Field in Phoenix. The Golden Gophers are 1.5-point favorites in the latest New Mexico vs. Minnesota odds from DraftKings Sportsbook, while the over/under for total points is 44.5, up two points from the opening line.

The Over is a combined 8-3 for the squads in road/neutral-site games in 2025. Also, the recent history of this bowl has leaned way over the total as the last two Rate Bowls have each seen 85 combined points scored.Both squads are solid versus the run but sieves versus the pass. Each allows a completion rate of over 68%, which puts them among the worst seven teams out of the 136 FBS programs. Thus, one can expect both offenses to air it out, which leads to lots of points on the scoreboard. The model forecasts the Over to hit with plenty of points to spare as simulations call for 54 combined points. Thus, the Over hits 70% of the time.The model also says one side of the spread hits nearly 60% of the time. You can see the model's pick at SportsLine.  So who wins Minnesota vs. New Mexico, and which side of the spread hits nearly 60% of the time? Visit SportsLine now to see which side of the New Mexico vs. Minnesota spread to jump on, all from the model that has simulated this matchup 10,000 times, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\nMaking NFL picks always carries a bit more excitement when there's something on the line, and that's the case with the Week 17 NFL schedule. No less than half a dozen matchups carry postseason implications for both teams, making them ideal ones to target with Week 17 NFL bets. Among those are Texans vs. Chargers (-1.5 at DraftKings Sportsbook) and Ravens vs. Packers (-4.5) on Saturday, then Jaguars vs. Colts (56.5), Seahawks vs. Panthers (+7) and Eagles vs. Bills (-1.5) on Sunday afternoon.Then on Sunday night, the 49ers are 3-point home favorites over the Bears, per the Week 17 NFL odds. If a rest edge matters to you, then you may want to back the Bears with Week 17 NFL predictions as Chicago's coming off a Saturday game, while San Fran is coming off a Monday game. All of the updated Week 17 NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Week 17 NFL picks now.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters Week 17 on a 52-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now, it has turned its attention to the latest Week 17 NFL odds and NFL betting lines and locked in betting picks for every NFL matchup. Head here to see every pick. Top Week 17 NFL predictionsWe can tell you one of the model's strongest Week 17 NFL picks is that the Steelers (-3, 34.5) cover versus Cleveland on Sunday at 1 p.m. ET. Pittsburgh has rolled off three straight wins -- and three straight covers -- to control its own destiny to claim the AFC North. Meanwhile, Cleveland fought valiantly in its loss to the Bills on Sunday, but the Browns are now 0-4 straight-up and 1-3 ATS over the last month. Shedeur Sanders has brought excitement to the Browns but not necessarily many winning plays as no player has more turnovers (seven) than Sanders since he became starter in Week 12. Pittsburgh capitalizes off taking the ball away as the Steelers have covered in six straight games this season when winning the turnover battle. The model has Pittsburgh prevailing versus the spread nearly 60% of the time. See which other teams to pick here, and bet the Steelers using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nAnother one of its Week 17 NFL predictions: the Bengals (-7.5, 53.5) cover against the Cardinals in a 1 p.m. ET kick on Sunday. Both teams are out of the playoff picture, but Cincinnati is in much better form overall. The Bengals have won two of their past four and have covered in four of their past five. The Cardinals, meanwhile, have dropped seven straight and are just 1-6 against the spread during that span. In addition to backing the Broncos, the model also says the Over hits nearly 60% of the time. See which other teams to pick here, and bet the Bengals to cover at DraftKings:\nHow to make Week 17 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 17 NFL schedule and just revealed seven teams that outright win nearly 70% of the time, or more, potentially giving you a huge payday.

But if I wait on Adebayo, then this ML probably isn't playable. Since it's the front end of a back-to-back for Miami, I tend to think the team gives him that extra day off, and he plays Saturday back at home.

Starting quarterback Owen McCown is the son of 16-year NFL QB Josh McCown, and although Owen McCown's throwing style certainly looks different as a lefthander, he can sling the ball like his dad. McCown threw for 2,700 yards and 27 touchdowns with seven interceptions this season. He also has a top running back behind him in Robert Henry Jr., who rushed for 1,045 yards on 6.9 yards per carry this season.

    "body": "\n        The NBA's marquee Christmas Day slate was a doozy. From the Knicks' big comeback to an overtime battle between the Timberwolves and Nuggets, the day was filled with excitement. As we turn our attention towards the final few days of 2025, there are still some players on the waiver wire who can help fantasy managers. Here are five players to consider adding who are still available in the majority of CBS leagues.Peyton Watson, Denver Nuggets (47% rostered)Depth has become a problem for the Nuggets. Aaron Gordon (hamstring) and Christian Braun (ankle) have been dealing with long-term absences. Now, Cameron Johnson (knee) is expected to miss at least four weeks. While Johnson's overall production has been a disappointment, he has averaged 31 minutes a game. His injury leaves Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray as the Nuggets' only healthy starters from the beginning of the season.Watson started each of his last 17 games with the Nuggets being so short-handed. While his numbers don't jump off the page, he averaged 13.5 points, 5.2 rebounds, 0.8 steals, one block, and 1.6 3-pointers during that span. He also shot 53.5% from the field. Watson can do enough across the board to be worth rostering in most leagues. Brook Lopez, Los Angeles Clippers (18% rostered)The injury to Ivica Zubac (ankle) has complicated what has already been a disappointing season for the Clippers. He will be out at least three weeks, leaving increased opportunities for both Lopez and John Collins. In their first full game without Zubac, Collins played 29 minutes against the Rockets and produced 13 points, five rebounds, five assists, two steals, two blocks, and three 3-pointers.\nLopez also started versus the Rockets, posting five points, six rebounds, four assists, two blocks, and one 3-pointer over 27 minutes. Even with him playing just 15 minutes per game this season, Lopez has averaged one block and 1.3 3-pointers. While he's not likely to play over 30 minutes on a nightly basis, he could certainly play 22-25 minutes a game moving forward. That's enough to consider adding him if you need blocks and 3-pointers.Sandro Mamukelashvili, Toronto Raptors (18% rostered)It has been an injury-filled season for Jakob Poeltl, who has already missed 10 games. He is currently sidelined by a back issue and has been ruled out for Friday's game against the Wizards. When he has been on the floor, he has only averaged 25 minutes. That's his lowest mark since the 2019-20 season.Mamukelashvili has started each of the last three games that Poeltl has missed. Across five total starts this season, he has averaged 16.2 points, six rebounds, 3.4 assists, and 3.4 3-pointers. Last season, he shot 37.3% from behind the arc, and he has followed that up by shooting 41.2% from deep this season. Back injuries can be tricky, so picking up Mamukelashvili now could prove to be a wise move if Poeltl ends up being out long-term.\nTim Hardaway Jr., Denver Nuggets (17% rostered)Hardaway was a bright spot for the Nuggets in their Christmas win over the Timberwolves, scoring 19 points over 41 minutes. He shot 3-for-11 from behind the arc, marking his sixth straight game with multiple made 3-pointers. Over his last three games, he has drained 16 total triples. In his first season with the Nuggets, the veteran has shot 41.9% on his 3-point attempts.It's not a huge surprise that Hardaway is having the most efficient season of his career from behind the arc. With opposing defenses giving so much attention to Jokic and Murray, Hardaway receives a lot of quality looks. Don't look for Hardaway to provide much in terms of rebounds, assists, or defense stats, but fantasy managers specifically hunting for points and 3-pointers should consider adding him.Tyler Kolek, New York Knicks (12% rostered)Kolek had a breakout performance when the Knicks defeated the Spurs in the NBA Cup championship game. While that didn't count for fantasy, he has carried over his success since then. Over the last five games, he has posted at least 16 points and eight assists in a game three times. Over the entire five-game span, he averaged 12 points, 5.2 rebounds, 6.6 assists, and 1.6 3-pointers.\nKolek is receiving additional opportunities to contribute because Miles McBride (ankle) is out. McBride has been labeled as week-to-week, and there haven't been any positive updates regarding his status. For as long as McBride remains sidelined, Kolek can provide value in deeper formats. Just be aware that it likely won't be smooth sailing for him. In one game during his recent hot streak, he had just two points and two assists over 15 minutes against the 76ers. Like many bench players, his role could fluctuate a bit on a nightly basis.\n            ",

The Seahawks are in this position after pulling off an improbable, come-from-behind win over the Los Angeles Rams in Week 16. Carolina (8-7) can stay ahead of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the NFC South standings if they are able to defeat the Seahawks. The Panthers are currently holding onto the NFC's No. 4 seed after recording a 23-20 win over the Buccaneers last Sunday. \nWhere to watch Seahawks vs. Panthers liveDate: Sunday, Dec. 28 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation:  Bank of America Stadium -- Charlotte, North Carolina TV: FOX | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Seahawks -7, O/U 42.5 (via DraftKings)Seahawks vs. Panthers: Need to know Tough to beat. It's hard to find a weakness on Seattle's team. They're currently No. 3 in the league in scoring, second in points allowed, and have one of the league's top returners in Rashid Shaheed, who made the Pro Bowl less than a week after returning a punt 58 yards for a score during Seattle's win over Los Angeles. Elite WR. This has been a breakout season for former first-round pick Jaxon Smith-Njigba, who currently leads the NFL with 1,637 receiving yards. He's built a quick rapport this season with new quarterback Sam Darnold, who was just named to his second straight Pro Bowl. Just being Ernest. Seattle's defense has gotten stellar play this year from several players, especially linebacker Ernest Jones. Despite missing two games, Jones leads the team with 116 tackles and five interceptions. He had two interceptions -- including a pick-six -- during Seattle's Week 13 win over the Minnesota Vikings. Third-down woes. If the Seahawks have an Achilles heel, it's their third-down offense as they are currently 23rd in the league in that area. Fortunately for them, they'll be facing a Panthers defense that is 30th in the league on third down. Ground and pound? A strength of for a large portion of the season, the Panthers' running game hasn't been as good in recent weeks. Rico Dowdle recently crossed the 1,000-yard barrier, but he hasn't rushed for over 58 yards in six weeks. Chuba Hubbard, who had a season-high 83 rushing yards during the Panthers' Week 13 win over the Rams, has toted the rock just 14 times over the past two games. Emerging rookie. Panthers rookie wideout Tetairoa McMillan has quietly been having a highly-successful rookie season. His 924 receiving yards is nearly 600 more yards than Carolina's second leading receiver. Stingy secondary. Carolina's defense has been led by cornerbacks Jaycee Horn and Mike Jackson. The duo has combined to record eight interceptions, with Horn having a team-high five picks. Jackson's 17 pass breakups leads the entire league. Seahawks vs. Panthers prediction, pick \nOn paper, this should be a win for the Seahawks, who are trying to secure the top seed in the playoffs first the first time since 2014. That being said, the Panthers' 2025 season has largely been defined by upset wins over teams considered superior. I'm baking on that happening again on Sunday, largely because of Carolina's opportunistic defense and the reliable play of quarterback Bryce Young. Pick: Panthers +7, Under 42.5 \n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

If that happens, the Steelers may be inclined to rest several starters, including 42-year-old quarterback Aaron Rodgers. Either way, Sunday's game may include the culmination of Myles Garrett's season-long pursuit of the NFL's single-season sack record. Garrett, who has tormented the Steelers in Cleveland in recent years, needs just one sack on Sunday to break that record that is currently shared by former Giants pass rusher Michael Strahan and current Steelers T.J. Watt. Where to watch Steelers vs. Browns liveDate: Sunday, Dec. 28 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: Huntington Bank Field -- Cleveland, Ohio  TV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+ Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Steelers -3, O/U 33.5 (via DraftKings)Steelers vs. Browns: Need to know Myles the menace. Garrett sacked Steelers quarterbacks five times in Cleveland's last two home games vs. Pittsburgh. \"He's a game wrecker,\" Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said of Garrett earlier this week. \"He provides the wave that others ride, and particularly in that environment when you're working on silent counts and one-dimensional passing circumstances, etc. It is significant.\" No DK. The Steelers will be without leading receiver DK Metcalf for this game after he was suspended for two games by the NFL stemming from his altercation with a Lions fan during Pittsburgh's Week 16 win in Detroit. Tomlin specifically mentioned Roman Wilson has someone whom he hopes steps up amid Metcalf's absence. A 2024 third-round pick, Wilson has 12 catches and two touchdowns this season, but his role has diminished with the recent additions of Adam Thielen and Marquez Valdes-Scantling. More Mason? If Baltimore loses Saturday night, there's a good chance that Mason Rudolph will either start or get significant reps Sunday in Cleveland. Rudolph has already started (and lost) two games in Cleveland: in 2019 and during the final game of the 2020 season. In the later game, he threw for a career-high 315 yards in a 24-22 loss. Cleveland doesn't rock for Pittsburgh. Cleveland has been a house of horrors for the Steelers as of late. Since 2018, the Steelers are just 1-5-1 in Cleveland that includes three consecutive losses. Tomlin, when asked what has often led to his team's struggles in Cleveland, kept his answer simple: \"Myles Garrett.\" Shedeur's sixth start. Sunday will be Shedeur Sanders' introduction into one of the NFL's oldest rivalries. Sanders' first five starts yielded mixed results. While he has shown flashes of his potential, Sanders is nonetheless completing just 55.1% of his passes with more interceptions (8) than touchdown passes (6). Steelers vs. Browns prediction, pick \nStatistically, the Browns have the NFC North's best defense, led by veteran defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz. That defense has kept them in numerous games this season, and it might do so again Sunday against a Steelers offense that won't have Metcalf and may decide to rest some of its starters if the division title is already locked up.\nIf the division is still up for grabs, though, I don't see the Steelers losing this one, not with how well Rodgers has played in recent weeks. Rodgers & Co. will be highly motivated to take care of business so that they can rest in Week 18 while getting an early start on the playoffs. Pick: Steelers -3.5, Under 33.5 \n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

The Dolphins are coming off a 45-21 beatdown loss that came at the hands of Joe Burrow and the Cincinnati Bengals, while the Buccaneers were upset by the rival Carolina Panthers, 23-20.Despite the loss to Carolina last Sunday, the Buccaneers aren't dead yet. The Panthers have a tough matchup this week against the Seattle Seahawks, meaning we could be looking at a win-and-in Week 18 showdown in Tampa. As for the Dolphins, they have already been eliminated from playoff contention and are trying out a new quarterback. We'll get more into that later. Let's break down this interconference matchup. But first, here's how you can watch the game. \nWhere to watch Buccaneers vs. Dolphins liveDate: Sunday, Dec. 28 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: Hard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, FloridaTV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Buccaneers -5.5, O/U 45.5 (via DraftKings)Buccaneers vs. Dolphins: Need to knowQuinn Ewers' debut. The rookie quarterback out of Texas completed 20 of 30 passes for zero touchdowns and two interceptions in his first NFL start. Miami was actually down just three points at the halftime before the Bengals scored 21 unanswered in the third quarter. Miami rushing attack. Predictably, the Dolphins wanted to run the ball to support their rookie signal-caller. De'Von Achane led the charge with 81 rushing yards and a touchdown, Jaylen Wright chipped in 35 yards and a touchdown, then Malik Washington scored a rushing touchdown as well. That made Miami the third team to have rushing touchdowns scored by three different players in a 20-point loss over the last 75 seasons. Mike McDaniel's job security. League sources indicated to CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones a belief that Mike McDaniel is likely to return as head coach of the Dolphins in 2026. Multiple prospective head coach and general manager candidates, as well as agents, told CBS Sports they are now operating under the belief the Dolphins will keep McDaniel.A season-altering losing streak. The Buccaneers have lost three straight games, and six out of the last seven following a 6-2 start. At one point, Mayfield looked like an MVP favorite while the Bucs looked like the easy choice to win the NFC South. That is no longer the case. What happened to the Bucs defense? Tampa Bay ranks No. 22 in total yards allowed per game (343.3), No. 24 in scoring defense (25.1 points allowed per game) and No. 27 in pass defense (242.0 passing yards allowed per game). The Bucs also have the second-worst opponent red-zone touchdown percentage (71.1%) in the league.CategoryFirst eight gamesLast seven gamesW-L6-21-6Points per game differential+2.4-7.0Turnover margin+7+1Buccaneers at Dolphins: prediction, pick\nThe Buccaneers have not been a good team to bet on this season. Their 5-10 against-the-spread record is tied for worst in the NFL, and they are 0-7 against the spread in their last seven games. With that being said, I'll go out on a limb and say Todd Bowles' defense and Mayfield's offense hit the field with aggression. This team is better than they've played over the past few weeks, and they understand it's do-or-die. Pick: Buccaneers -5.5, Over 45.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

The Saints and Titans have been playing some good football lately, which should make for a fascinating matchup in Nashville on Sunday.The Saints just won their third straight game with a comfortable 23-point win over the New York Jets in The Big Easy. Tyler Shough continued to shine as he topped 300 yards for the first time in his young career. There may have been some head-scratching when the Saints selected Shough in the second round of the 2025 NFL Draft, but he is silencing those doubters. On the other side of the ball, the New Orleans defense has been salty, that unit now ranks 14th in the league with 22.5 points allowed per game.The Titans, on the other hand, just got done taking it to the short-handed Kansas City Chiefs for a big win. Rookie quarterback Cam Ward played perhaps his best game of the season, completing 21 of his 28 passing attempts for 228 yards and two touchdowns. His play has been an encouraging development for Tennessee down the stretch, and he has another chance to assert himself as a budding star this weekend. Similarly, rookie wideout Chimere Dike was named to the Pro Bowl as a returner, and he caught his fourth touchdown pass of the season against Kansas City.Here is everything you need to know about this matchup of scrappy underdogs.\nWhere to watch Saints vs. Titans liveDate: Sunday, Dec. 28 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: Nissan Stadium -- Nashville, TennesseeTV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Saints +2.5, O/U 39.5 (via DraftKings)Saints vs. Titans: Need to knowTitans going for two in a row (again). The Titans have another chance to win two games in a row for the first time since Weeks 10 and 11 in the 2022 season. They had the same opportunity a couple of weeks ago when they went on the road to San Francisco. While Tennessee put up a good effort in that contest, it fell short against a more talented team. These two teams are more evenly matched, so maybe the Titans can put an end to their rather embarrassing streak.Those streaking Saints. Speaking of streaking, the Saints have now rattled off three straight wins. It's been an impressive midseason turnaround under first-year coach Kellen Moore, and now New Orleans can do something it hasn't done since 2020: win four straight games. It should be noted that Saints team went 12-4 and reached the divisional round of the playoffs. This team won't reach the postseason, but there is a lot of hope around this group right now.The NFL Draft implications. Of course, when two teams with crummy records meet this late in the season, there are major implications for the NFL Draft. That is certainly the case in this one. The Titans currently hold the No. 5 overall pick, and the Saints hold the No. 8 overall selection. The losing front office can take some solace in the fact that it will be well-positioned to take a game-changer at the top of the 2026 draft.Saints vs. Titans prediction, pickThese teams are coming off big wins over opponents who were -- as the kids say -- down bad. How much can we take from those victories? For starters, I do think the progression we've seen from these young quarterbacks is real. Because of that, we might get enough offensive fireworks to surpass the projected total. Pick: Titans -2.5, Over 39.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

The Bills are coming off a 23-20 victory over the Cleveland Browns, while the Eagles clinched the NFC East for the second straight year with a 29-18 victory over the Washington Commanders. Both teams have already clinched playoff berths, but seeding is to be determined.Believe it or not, Josh Allen and Jalen Hurts have faced off just once before, back in 2023. In that matchup, the Eagles defeated the Bills in overtime, 37-34. Buffalo led by 10 points entering the fourth quarter, but two Hurts passing touchdowns eventually got the game to overtime where the Eagles star QB finished off the comeback with a 12-yard touchdown run. What will happen this time around?Let's break down this interconference matchup. But first, here's how you can watch. \nWhere to watch Eagles vs. Bills liveDate: Sunday, Dec. 28 | Time: 4:25 p.m. ETLocation: Highmark Stadium -- Orchard Park, New YorkTV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Bills -1.5, O/U 43.5 (via DraftKings)Eagles vs. Bills: Need to knowHistorical clinching of the division: Last Saturday, the Eagles clinched their fifth straight playoff appearance and second straight NFC East title. Philadelphia becomes the first repeat NFC East champion since 2004, marking the end of the longest such drought in NFL/NBA/MLB/NHL history. Eagles offense finding their stride? They haven't faced the stiffest competition in recent weeks, but could we see the Eagles offense hit their stride and win the Super Bowl just like last year? Hurts has thrown five touchdowns without an interception over the past two games after throwing four interceptions and no touchdowns in that disastrous loss to the Los Angeles Chargers. His 24 passing touchdowns are the most by an Eagles player since 2017. However, this game on Sunday may be decided by the rushing attack.Bills run defense a problem: The Bills have the third-worst run defense in the NFL, allowing 144.3 rushing yards per game. Buffalo allows 5.4 yards per rush -- which ranks second-worst in the NFL. According to CBS Sports Research, those 5.4 yards per rush allowed ranks second-worst among playoff teams since 1970. The Bills have also already allowed the most 30-yard rushing touchdowns in a season in NFL history with eight.Who benefits from a high-scoring battle? The Bills' struggles defending the run are well-documented, but Allen and James Cook have often times been able to overcome it. If you want to engage in a shootout with the Bills, they usually win. Buffalo is 4-0 when allowing 31 or more points this season while the rest of the NFL is 9-93-2. Unreal.Bills' path to the No. 1 seed in the AFC: Win out + Denver Broncos loss + New England Patriots loss + Jacksonville Jaguars loss + Chargers loss. Eagles vs. Bills prediction, pick\nAt face value, the Bills probably look like the better team right now. However, I think it's possible the Eagles have turned a corner. If Kevin Patullo and Nick Sirianni are smart, Sunday is going to be about the ground game -- run the ball with Hurts and Saquon Barkley. While I'm not confident on the total, give me the Eagles in the upset. Philly is 5-1 straight up as an underdog over the last two seasons. Pick: Eagles +1.5, Over 43.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

The Colts are coming off a 48-27 loss to the San Francisco 49ers on \"Monday Night Football,\" while the Jaguars registered a 34-20 upset road victory over the Denver Broncos.These two teams faced off just three weeks ago, which was the matchup in which Daniel Jones tore his Achilles. Jacksonville won that game in a driving rain storm, 36-19. This recent push has the Jaguars sitting atop the division at 11-4, while the 8-7 Colts are in third place behind the 10-5 Houston Texans. The Philip Rivers experiment has been fun, but the fact of the matter is the Colts have lost five straight games, and now have only a 1.8% chance to make the playoffs, according to SportsLine's projections. Let's break down this divisional matchup. But first, here's how you can watch the game. \nWhere to watch Jaguars vs. Colts liveDate: Sunday, Dec. 28 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: Lucas Oil Stadium -- Indianapolis, IndianaTV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Jaguars -6.5, O/U 47.5 (via DraftKings)Jaguars vs. Colts: Need to knowTrevor Lawrence is on fire. Lawrence has been one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL over the last month or so, and completed 23 of 36 passes for 279 yards, three touchdowns, zero interceptions and added a touchdown on the ground vs. the Broncos. Last week, he became the fourth player all-time to score 10 touchdowns and commit zero turnovers in a two-game span, joining Josh Allen in 2024, Drew Brees in 2019 and Patrick Mahomes in 2018. Over the last six weeks, Lawrence is the NFL leader in yards per attempt (8.4), total touchdowns (19) and passer rating (108.7). Best streak in franchise history? The Jaguars' six-game win streak matches the franchise's longest single-season win streak since 1999, and the 34.2 points per game Jacksonville has averaged in that span are also the most points in a six-game span in Jags' history. The team has also scored 25 points in eight straight games, which is the longest streak in team history as well.Jonathan Taylor contained. The Colts running back looked like a legitimate MVP candidate for the majority of the season, but Taylor has been held under 100 rushing yards in five straight games. He's averaging 76 rushing yards per game and 3.7 yards per rush during that span, after averaging 113.9 rushing yards per game and 6.0 yards per rush in the first 10 games of the season.How do the Colts make the playoffs? It's unlikely, but Indy could still make the postseason. All the Colts need to do is beat the Jaguars on Sunday, and the Texans next week. The Texans also need to lose to the Los Angeles Chargers this Saturday. So, the Colts need to win out, and the Texans need to lose out.Jaguars vs. Colts prediction, pick\nThis Jaguars team is 10-5 against the spread, and clearly riding high following the upset win in Denver. As for the Colts, it was pretty notable that they gave up a whopping 48 points to the 49ers with extra time to prepare. Brock Purdy was magnificent with 295 passing yards, five touchdowns and one interception, which came late. Could Lawrence do something similar if Sauce Gardner is out again? With the number under a touchdown, I'll take the Jaguars. Pick: Jaguars -6.5, Over 47.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

The schedule is stacked once again this year as fanbases are afforded the opportunity to see their teams in action one more time before the attention turns to the 2026 season. The bowl schedule kicked off Saturday, Dec. 13 and goes all the way until Jan. 2. The College Football Playoff carries us from there to Jan. 19, when two teams will vie for a national championship in Miami Gardens, Florida. CBS will once again broadcast the Tony the Tiger Sun Bowl. Kick is set for 2 p.m. on Dec. 31 in El Paso, Texas. Additionally, Dec. 27 is one of the most stacked days of the year as eight bowl games will take place on that day, including the Pop-Tarts Bowl, Texas Bowl and Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl Presented By Gin & Juice By Dre and Snoop (yes, that's its official name). \nBelow is a detailed look at the complete schedule for the 2025-26 college football bowl season, including dates, locations and TV channels.

    "body": "\n        For the second time in a row, Michigan had to make its head coaching hire at an inopportune time. First, it was because of the departure of Jim Harbaugh after a national championship win. The Wolverines couldn't make a hire until Jan. 26, 2024, after Harbaugh left for the NFL The program eventually promoted offensive coordinator Sherrone Moore to head coach. Now, after Moore's personal scandal that embroiled the athletic department, the Wolverines were without a coach well into December. Michigan needed a stabilizing force to help bring both the football program and athletic department back to respectability. By hiring future Hall of Famer Kyle Whittingham, Michigan has found an ideal coach to lead them through this turbulent era. Whittingham, 66, is one of the most successful coaches of this era. After taking over for Urban Meyer at Utah in 2005, he helped lead them from the Mountain West to the top of the Power Five. Whittingham has a 177-88 career record with two Pac-12 titles and a Mountain West crown.\n\n        \n            \n                Michigan hires Kyle Whittingham as former longtime Utah coach is tapped to lead Wolverines\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nPerhaps most important, Whittingham has a spotless reputation during his standout career. His teams have featured few scandals and strong team cultures. At Michigan, he will provide a veteran, experienced hand -- a direct contrast to the foibles of the Moore era. And in both the short and long term, it will pay dividends. Whittingham helped lead a turnaround from 5-7 to 10-2 at Utah this season, spearheaded by a stacked offensive line. The defense remained an elite unit. The Utes just had the misfortune of playing the two best teams in the conference -- BYU and Texas Tech. If they missed one, there's a solid chance they would have been in the College Football Playoff. Now at Michigan, Whittingham will have more resources to win than any moment in legendary career. The Wolverines managed to pull No. 1 overall recruit Bryce Underwood to the program last year with a massive contract. Even after middling seasons, Moore managed to put together back-to-back top 11 recruiting classes. \nWhile Whittingham has never recruited at the most elite of the elite levels, he helped the Utes push into the top 25 national level. Even in his final Class of 2026, Whittingham helped land two top 100 recruits. With the monetary backing of Michigan, he should be able to swim in deeper waters. Whittingham is already backchanneling with some of the top assistant coaches in college football. Utah offensive coordinator Jason Beck and BYU defensive coordinator Jay Hill are both targets for Whittingham in Ann Arbor, according to CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz. Both would be game-changing additions to the Big Ten. Additionally, Whittingham is proven enough that the administrative questions swirling around Michigan will be a non-factor. The university does not have a permanent president, and athletic director Warde Manuel is under fire after repeated scandals in the athletic department. That same department is also undergoing a major outside review; Whittingham is a strong enough culture-setter that he will not be distracted by the noise. \nGranted, the hire of Whittingham is a short-term decision. While Whittingham is more motivated to coach at 66 than even he expected, few coaches in college football coach past 70. Even now, Whittingham becomes the third-oldest coach in major college football, only behind Iowa's Kirk Ferentz and North Carolina's Bill Belichick. Over the offseason, Utah mutually decided to move on from Whittingham and promote coach-in-waiting Morgan Scalley to the head job. Whittingham hinted for years that he was close to retirement, and Scalley was first named coach-in-waiting all the way back in 2019. Finally, after six years, Utah decided to pull the trigger. Eventually, Michigan may have to do the same. However, three of the last four coaches at Michigan failed to make it through four full seasons. Those three coaches combined for only one 10-win season. Three good seasons from Whittingham would be far more welcome than taking a chance on a lesser coach and setting the program back. \nAnd when looking around the market, there were few obvious prospects available. Alabama's Kalen DeBoer and Arizona State's Kenny Dillingham both publicly announced they were returning. Louisville's Jeff Brohm was not seriously involved in the process, according to multiple reports. Several others signed long-term extensions, like Vanderbilt's Clark Lea and BYU's Kalani Sitake. Michigan hired a Hall of Fame coach to help shepherd them into the next era of the program. Even if it's a short-term solution, it's the perfect one for this moment. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Los Angeles Lakers star guard Austin Reaves will miss at least the next four weeks after being diagnosed with a grade 2 left gastrocnemius (calf) strain, ESPN reported on Friday. Reaves exited in the first half during the Lakers' 119-96 loss to the Houston Rockets on Christmas Day and did not return.\"Austin clearly felt something,\" Lakers coach JJ Redick said postgame. \"We did our normal halftime, and then as we were walking out of the locker room, [Lakers director of player performance and health] Dr. [LeRoy] Sims told me he was out.\"Reaves finished the game by scoring 12 points on 5 of 8 shooting in 15 minutes of action. With Reaves out of the lineup for the second half against Houston, veteran Marcus Smart started in his place.\n        \n            \n                JJ Redick blasts Lakers after Christmas loss to Rockets: 'We don't care enough right now'\n                \n                    Brent Brookhouse                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nReaves, 27, is in the midst of a career year with Los Angeles. The former undrafted free agent out of Oklahoma is averaging 26.6 points, 6.3 assists and 5.2 rebounds per game. Reaves scored a career-high 51 points earlier this season against the Sacramento Kings and nearly finished with a triple-double by adding 11 rebounds and nine assists.\nDespite being the second-leading scorer on his own team -- behind league-leading scorer Luka Dončić -- Reaves has filled the void while other Lakers players have been out of the lineup. Notably, LeBron James missed the first few weeks of the season due to sciatica and didn't make his season debut until Nov. 18 against the Utah Jazz.Reaves injury comes amid the Lakers' losing streakWith the loss to the Rockets on Christmas, the Lakers dropped to 19-10. Los Angeles has lost three consecutive games by double digits (Phoenix Suns, Los Angeles Clippers and Rockets). After the latest setback to Houston, Redick went on a long rant about the way his team has playing, saying that the Lakers \"don't care enough right now.\"\"We don't care enough right now,\" Redick said. \"And that's the part that bothers you a lot. We don't care enough to do the things that are necessary. We don't care enough to be a professional.\"\nThe Lakers began the 2025-26 campaign 15-4. Since that hot start, Los Angeles is 4-6 in its last 10 games. The Lakers trailed by double digits the entire second half against Houston.\n        \n            \n                JJ Redick torched Lakers' players after Christmas loss, but the real blame lies with the GM who acquired them\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"The two words of the day were effort and execution,\" Redick said. \"And I feel like when we've done both of those things at a high level, we've been a good basketball team. When we haven't, we're a terrible basketball team. And tonight we were a terrible basketball team. And that started legitimately right away.\"The four-week timeline for Reaves would likely result in him missing a majority of January. The Lakers face the Kings on Sunday and the Pistons on Tuesday before the calendar flips to 2026.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Pittsburgh Steelers are riding high following their Week 16 upset victory over the Detroit Lions and are the clear-cut frontrunners in the AFC North with a 9-6 record. Unfortunately for the Steelers, they will be without their best player as they try to clinch the division on Sunday against the Cleveland Browns.Pittsburgh announced Friday that star pass rusher T.J. Watt will miss the game despite returning to practice this week. Watt has been trending in the right direction after suffering a partially collapsed lung during a dry needling mishap. On Wednesday, he attended practice for the first time since undergoing surgery, though he was listed as a limited participant.The Steelers will now target a Week 18 return for Watt as they gear up for a playoff run. Just having Watt back on the practice field provided a boost to his teammates.\"It's awesome to have him out there,\" pass rusher Alex Highsmith said, via ESPN. \"Just seeing him back out in the field with us, he's getting better every single day, so I think just to have him back out there, just as a leader for our group, it's just awesome to see. Excited to see how he continues to work his way back.\"\nTwo weeks ago, Watt went to a Pittsburgh hospital after experiencing discomfort in his chest. That led to him undergoing surgery to repair a partially collapsed lung. \"TJ had successful surgery to stabilize and repair a partially collapsed lung suffered Wednesday after a dry needling treatment session at the facility,\" Watt's brother, J.J. Watt, posted on social media on Dec. 12. \"  He and his family are very appreciative of everyone's kind words and well wishes.\"Watt has 53 combined tackles, 10 tackles for loss, seven sacks, three forced fumbles and one interception in the first 13 games of the season. The 2021 NFL Defensive Player of the Year is the league leader in forced fumbles (36) and QB hits (243) since being selected with the No. 30 overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft, and has recorded the fifth-most sacks in a player's first nine seasons all-time with 115.0.\nThe Steelers can officially clinch the AFC North with a win over the Browns on Sunday or a Baltimore Ravens loss to the Green Bay Packers on Saturday. Pittsburgh is looking to extend a three-game win streak in which the team is averaging 28 points per game. \n            ",

Just a serious deal where we were concerned enough to take him and get him checked.\"\nWesco was serving as Clemson's primary returner because typical return specialist Antonio Williams Jr. recently returned from a hamstring injury. Prior to exiting the game, Wesco, a former top prospect out of Midlothian, Texas, returned two kicks for 43 yards and four punts for 21 yards. He did not record any stats on offense. Wesco, who has 31 catches for 537 yards and six touchdowns this year, entered the 2025 season as one of Clemson's top offensive weapons after a breakout freshman campaign. \nThe 6-foot-2 Wesco finished his first year of college football with 41 receptions for 708 yards and five touchdowns, averaging 17.3 yards per catch. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        There's no conference with smaller margins than the Big 12. Look no further than Tempe to illustrate that point.No. 7 Texas Tech looked like a true national championship contender ahead of a road showdown against Arizona State. The Red Raiders had beaten Big 12 opponents -- all with winning records -- by an average margin of 24.3 points per game. Arizona State, for its part, was coming off a 32-point road loss to Utah and had won three-point squeakers in its other two Big 12 matchups. Yet down went the Red Raiders: Arizona State 26, Texas Tech 22. The circumstances weren't ideal for Texas Tech, which played without starting quarterback Behren Morton. But the Red Raiders, thanks to the tens of millions they spent in the portal, were supposed to be able to overcome injuries thanks to the depth they created via the transfer market. They were the one Big 12 team that stood above the rest from a talent and depth perspective. But it wasn't enough to beat Arizona State, which put together a game-winning drive in the final minutes to pull the upset, largely thanks to the star duo of quarterback Sam Leavitt and wide receiver Jordyn Tyson. That pair connected four times on the final drive for 55 yards, including a 33-yard completion on fourth down to extend the game. \nThe loss doesn't knock Texas Tech out of the College Football Playoff race, nor does it eliminate its path to Arlington for the Big 12 title game. It does, however, put over half the conference in play to earn a spot in Arlington. That is not an exaggeration.BYU and Cincinnati are the only Big 12 teams without a loss, and the Cougars have one of the toughest games of the season on Saturday night against Utah. \nThere's a real chance that by Sunday morning Cincinnati, which draws Oklahoma State this week, will be alone atop the league -- just like everyone expected. Look at all the team's that will have two or fewer losses in conference play ahead of Week 9: BYU Texas Tech Cincinnati Houston Utah Arizona State Iowa State TCU Baylor Kansas State KansasThat's 11 teams! Only the SEC can claim anything close to that sort of parity. But even that league still has teams that are expected to separate. Georgia and Alabama's talent usually wins out in the end. \nBut now that Texas Tech has a loss, everyone in the Big 12 looks beatable. Cincinnati posted wins in the final minutes over Kansas and Iowa State. BYU has one-possession wins over Colorado and Arizona. The Sun Devils, as mentioned before, have a pair of one-possession wins over TCU and Baylor. Everyone is vulnerable. Everyone is a contender. Texas Tech's loss does, however,  put the Big 12 in danger of being a one-bid league for the playoff. Even if Texas Tech runs the table -- still very possible -- it seems likely whoever else makes it to the Big 12 championship game will have at least two losses, and a three-loss Big 12 runner-up is not getting into a 12-team bracket. But that's a concern for later if you're Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark. For now, the Big 12 is the most competitive and unpredictable autonomy league in a season nation-wide that's already been defined by parity. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Four interceptions from Carson Beck and a shaky, unprepared start doomed Miami on Friday night as one of the nation's College Football Playoff frontrunners took a hard fall in Week 8, losing to Louisville in a stunning upset.Miami drops out of our latest top-four projection, along with Texas Tech following its 26-22 loss at Arizona State. The Red Raiders' setback adds even more chaos to the Big 12 race, where nearly a dozen teams remain mathematically alive for the conference title at midseason.Several programs took advantage of the shakeups, including No. 12 Georgia Tech, No. 17 Vanderbilt and No. 13 Notre Dame -- each of which picked up key victories to strengthen their postseason cases.Georgia Tech won as a road underdog at Duke to stay unbeaten in ACC play, Vanderbilt knocked off No. 10 LSU and Notre Dame handled No. 20 USC. Alabama held its spot as the projected SEC champion after earning its fourth straight win over a ranked opponent, beating No. 11 Tennessee. And with ninth-ranked Georgia's victory over No. 5 Ole Miss, only fourth-ranked Texas A&M remains unbeaten in the SEC.\nCollege Football Playoff Quarterfinals DateGame / LocationProjectionJan. 1 Rose BowlPasadena, Calif.(1) Ohio State vs. (8/9) WinnerJan. 1 Sugar BowlNew Orleans, La.(2) Alabama vs. (7/10) WinnerJan. 1 Orange BowlMiami, Fla.(3) Indiana vs. (6/11) WinnerDec. 31 Cotton BowlArlington, Texas(4) Georgia vs. (5/12) WinnerFirst roundDate LocationProjectionWinner facesDec. 19 or 20Kyle FieldCollege Station, Texas(8) Texas A&M vs. (9) Miami(1) Ohio StateDec. 19 or 20Jones AT&T StadiumLubbock, Texas(7) Texas Tech vs. (10) Ole Miss(2) AlabamaDec. 19 or 20Autzen StadiumEugene, Ore.(6) Oregon vs. (11) Notre Dame(3) IndianaDec. 19 or 20Bobby Dodd StadiumAtlanta, Ga.(5) Georgia Tech vs. (12) South Florida(4) GeorgiaDon't see your team? Check out Brad Crawford's complete bowl projections.Projected College Football Playoff Field breakdown1. Ohio State (projected Big Ten champion): The Buckeyes pitched a shutout at Wisconsin, and quarterback Julian Sayin strengthened his Heisman case with several touchdown passes as Ohio State cruised to another lopsided Big Ten win. It doesn't appear the nation's top team will be tested until late November, when it visits Michigan.2. Alabama (projected SEC champion): Any steakhouse in Tuscaloosa would be happy to give Zabien Brown his choice of cut this weekend after his 99-yard interception return for a touchdown as time expired in the second quarter against Tennessee. The play swung momentum for Alabama, deflating the Vols' upset bid before the Crimson Tide held on late. When the dust settles, Alabama could have the nation's best résumé by early December with several wins over ranked opponents. The Tide extended their streak to four straight victories over top-25 teams with the win.3. Indiana: The playoff selection committee likely won't penalize Curt Cignetti's team much if the Hoosiers enter conference championship weekend unbeaten before falling to Ohio State. At worst, Indiana should be positioned at No. 3 or No. 4, with two signature top-10 wins. The Hoosiers started slow coming off the Oregon game but responded with a pair of second-quarter touchdowns in the final six minutes of the first half against Michigan State to take control.4. Georgia: Take a bow, Lawson Luckie. The Georgia tight end caught three touchdown passes, including a 7-yarder midway through the fourth quarter, as the Bulldogs erased a nine-point deficit to beat Ole Miss. Credit Georgia's defense for making key stops in the second half after the Rebels scored on their first five possessions. Still, that unit hasn't been playing at an elite level and must improve. Georgia owns two wins over top-15 opponents with a chance for up to three more.5. Georgia Tech (projected ACC champion): What happens if the Yellow Jackets enter rivalry weekend against Georgia ranked inside the top 10 and sitting at 11-0? They'd be playing for a first-round bye and potential top seed with wins over Georgia and another in Charlotte as ACC champions. That scenario looks more realistic after the victory at Duke.6. Oregon: The Ducks erupted for 42 first-half points at Rutgers, a strong rebound from the loss to Indiana. Oregon should reach 11 regular-season wins with relative ease unless USC gives its defense trouble next month at Autzen Stadium. Barring Ohio State or Indiana losing twice, the Ducks will likely have championship weekend off before hosting a first-round playoff game.7. Texas Tech (projected Big 12 champion): Despite rallying from 15 points down late in the fourth quarter to take the lead on the road, Texas Tech gave up a critical fourth-down conversion and couldn't stop Arizona State in the red zone, leading to its first loss. The Big 12 remains wide open, and in this scenario, the Red Raiders must win out and capture the league title game to stay in contention.8. Texas A&M: The Aggies handled Arkansas on the road to stay unbeaten, setting up key matchups over the next two weeks against ranked LSU and Missouri teams to pair with their earlier win over Notre Dame. Texas A&M scored on seven of nine possessions against the Razorbacks but allowed more than 500 yards of total offense, including two 100-yard rushers.9. Miami: The Hurricanes suffered Week 8's most stunning loss, falling to Louisville at home after an early 14-point deficit and four interceptions from Carson Beck. It's an ugly loss for a double-digit favorite and leaves Miami no longer in control of its ACC destiny if Georgia Tech and Virginia keep winning. Our projection has the winner of SMU-Miami in November facing the Yellow Jackets in the ACC title game. Virginia would need to lose two of its final five conference contests for that to happen.10. Ole Miss: Why the big drop after the Rebels' first loss? A trip to Oklahoma next week looms large, and a loss to the Sooners would eliminate any margin for error in November. There are no other ranked opponents on the schedule after that game, a 10-2 finish would leave their only top-25 win back in Week 5 against LSU.11. Notre Dame: Will this spot go to a fifth SEC team or 10-win Notre Dame? Strength of schedule will matter if Vanderbilt, Tennessee or Texas is in the mix. Saturday night's win over USC was pivotal for the Irish, who needed it to stay in the conversation.12. USF: After its win over FAU, USF sits atop the American alongside Tulane and Navy. The Midshipmen face a tough upcoming stretch against North Texas, Notre Dame and USF, while Tulane visits Memphis on Nov. 7. The next few weeks should clarify a tight race for the Group of Five's New Year's Six berth.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Green Bay Packers can cross one item off of their checklist this Sunday against the Arizona Cardinals. If they can defeat the struggling Cardinals, the Packers will get their first road victory of the season after losing in Cleveland in Week 3 and tying the Cowboys in Dallas in Week 4. After not winning either of their last two games before their Week 5 bye, the Packers got back to their winning ways last Sunday, defeating the Bengals behind a big performance by Josh Jacobs, who scored two touchdowns while tallying 150 all-purpose yards. Bet Cardinals vs. Packers at Bet365 Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets using the bonus code CBSBET365:Speaking of a win, the Cardinals haven't had one of those in quite some time. After a 2-0 start, Arizona has dropped four straight one-possession games that includes last week's four-point loss to the surging Colts, who were spearheaded by running back Jonathan Taylor's 123 yards that included the game-winning score. \nHere's how you can follow the action in real time, along with a breakdown and a prediction for Sunday. Where to watch Packers vs. Cardinals liveWhen: Sunday, Oct. 19 | Time: 4:25 p.m. ETWhere: State Farm Stadium -- Glendale, Arizona TV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Packers -6.5; O/U 44.5 (via FanDuel)Packers vs. Cardinals: Need to know The Cardinals are on the mend. Injuries have been one of the biggest reasons for the Cardinals' current four-game skid. But while the Cardinals had 12 players on this week's injury report, many of those players appear to be trending up in terms of their current injury situations. Among those players is Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray, who missed Arizona's Week 6 loss with a foot injury, but started the week as a limited practice participant. So did Cardinals second-year receiver Marvin Harrison Jr., who exited last Sunday's loss and was placed in the league's concussion protocol. Staying on schedule. While they are roughly average in most major categories, the Cardinals have been very good on both sides of the ball on third down. Arizona's offense is sixth in the NFL on third down, while it's defense is currently ranked seventh. Green Bay has actually been even better on third down this season, as they are first on offense and sixth on defense on third down. \nThe power of Love. Packers quarterback Jordan Love appears to be primed for a big game as the Cardinals' defense is currently 28th in the NFL in passing yards allowed. Love has been extremely accurate this season; he's completed at least 72% of his throws in all but four of his five starts. Packers have a big edge. Green Bay has a sizable advantage when it comes to the running game. Jacobs is coming off his best game of the season and appears primed for his first 100-yard game of the 2025 campaign. Conversely, the Cardinals has yet to fill the void left by James Conner's season-ending injury. Murray is currently the Cardinals' leading rusher with 175 yards. Packers vs. Cardinals prediction, pick \nArizona is better than its record, but until they prove that they can close out games, it's going to be hard to pick them in any game, especially one where they are a clear underdog. The Packers should win this one while leaning on their Pro Bowl running back. Pick: Packers -6.5; Over 44.5\n            ",

    "body": "\n        A reset is what the Philadelphia Eagles needed following a mini-bye, a few days off to get the season back on track following two straight losses. The Eagles were beaten soundly by the New York Giants before they headed into their mini-bye, falling back into the field in regards to the NFC East standings -- even though Philadelphia does still lead the division. The Eagles took time to self-reflect, an opportunity to (perhaps) get things right. Bet Eagles vs. Vikings at Bet365 Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets using the bonus code CBSBET365:\"It's always a good time to kinda reevaluate yourself,\" said Eagles linebacker Nakobe Dean. \"Evaluate yourself as a team, as an individual, as a unit.\"\nThe Eagles will have a challenge on their hands on Sunday, as they face the Minnesota Vikings, a team that is coming off a bye after a win over the Cleveland Browns in London. This opponent will provide a true test for Philadelphia given Brian Flores' aggressive defense. The Eagles have the highest pressure rate allowed this season (40%), while Minnesota has the second-highest defensive pressure rate (44%) and blitz rate (38%) this season. \"It's like one of those fun bags where you go to a party and you put your hand in and you don't know what you're gonna get,\" said Eagles offensive lineman Jordan Mailata. \"A lolly, or candy, a toy? You just never know what you're gonna get first, second down. The tape says what it says, but at the same time we know with a Brian Flores defense, expect the unexpected.\"\nWill the Eagles rebound against the Vikings? Will Carson Wentz keep the Vikings' ship afloat another week? Here's more on where to watch the game, along with a prediction and pick. Where to watch Vikings vs. Eagles live Date: Sunday, Oct. 19 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: U.S. Bank Stadium -- Minneapolis, MinnesotaTV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Eagles -1.5; O/U 43.5 (via DraftKings)When the Eagles have the ballThere has been plenty of conversation surrounding how the Eagles have so much offensive talent, yet are struggling to move the ball consistently. Heading into Week 7, the Eagles offense averaged 274.6 yards per game (30th in NFL), 21.5 offensive points per game (18th), 4.7 yards per play (28th), 3.5 yards per carry (28th), and have a 34.7% third-down conversion rate (27th). Those numbers are way below where Philadelphia was through Week 6 last season. So why is the offense struggling?\n\"Self-inflicted wounds,\" said Eagles wide receiver A.J. Brown. \"Sometimes lack of execution at the wrong time. If it's first down and you have a lack of execution, it might not be the end of the world. But when you get to third down, it puts you behind the sticks. That's hard to recover from in this league. So I think just being on the same page, communication and lack of execution.\"\nThe Eagles had opportunities to self-reflect, but they are aware of the challenges that Brian Flores' defense will present. The Vikings' has allowed 19.4 points per game this season (5th in NFL, 289.8 yards per game (8th), and a third-down conversion rate of just 30% (2nd). This may not be the week the offense gets right, but the Eagles will have to keep the Vikings defense on the field. They have a 44.4% three-and-out rate, which is second-highest in the NFL. \nWhen the Vikings have the ballThe Vikings won't have J.J. McCarthy back this week (ankle), even though he was limited in practice all week and has a questionable injury designation for the game. (McCarthy will be the third quarterback.) Carson Wentz will get the start against the team that drafted him, even though it's been five years since Wentz played for the Eagles. Wentz has been on five different teams since while the Eagles have been to two Super Bowls, winning one. Their paths couldn't have been more different since Wentz's departure. \"I enjoyed my time with Carson,\" said Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts. \"I learned a lot from him, He was always a pure student and taking everything in through my experience with him so I think right now just trying to set the best example I can [for the young guys], knowing some of the things that I was able to experience.\"\nWentz has played well filling in for McCarthy, completing 69% of his passes for 759 yards with five touchdowns to two interceptions in three games -- a passer rating of 99.5. He has been sacked 12 times while playing behind a makeshift offensive line, but the Vikings are expected to have at least four of the five starters playing this week as right tackle Brian O'Neill is questionable. As for Wentz's time in Philadelphia. That's well in the past. \"Maybe earlier in my career maybe I had a different feeling,\" Wentz said to reporters earlier this week. \"But at the same time, you look over there, and I'm not even sure there's anyone on the defensive side that I've played with. It just looks different. So it's another opponent. \"A lot of respect for those guys. There's still guys in that organization, there's a lot of good people that I still have a lot of care for and respect for. But, at the same time, that feels like multiple lifetimes ago at this point.\"\nVikings vs. Eagles prediction, pick\nThe mini-bye may just be the formula to get the Eagles back on track, as they look to get the run game going and reset their offense after an inconsistent six weeks. Jalen Hurts is getting the ball to A.J. Brown, but throwing the ball has not set up the run game like the Eagles would have liked. Landon Dickerson is questionable, but it looks like he'll play on Sunday, which is a huge boost for Philadelphia's offensive line. The Eagles have to get into third-and-shorts and move the chains, so running the ball and gaining positive yards on first and second down will be paramount. The Vikings pass rush will play a major role in this one. On the defensive side of the ball, having Jalen Carter and Quinyon Mitchell back is massive. (Carter is listed as questionable but he said he's playing.) Whoever is the CB2 will have their hands full against Jordan Addison. If the Eagles pass rush can get to Wentz, they have a shot to win this game. However, a third of the way through the season there's been no evidence they can do that -- and Za'Darius Smith suddenly retired. The Vikings should win this game bases on how the Eagles have played, but Philadelphia has more talent and needs to play up to that. \nLet's bank on the culture in this one. Pick: Eagles 27, Vikings 24\n            ",

    "body": "\n        In a thrilling clash that lived up to its potential playoff-hype billing, the Washington Spirit and Orlando Pride delivered an instant NWSL classic on Saturday on CBS. The third-place Pride secured a dramatic 3-2 comeback victory over the second-place Spirit on the road at Audi Field. In a match that was a wild roller coaster that featured lead changes, two own goals, and a decisive penalty that ultimately snapped the Spirit's 12-game unbeaten streak, it was a crucial three points for Orlando, who are rallying into a better form ahead of the NWSL postseason. \"Great game, great result. You know, we were disappointed with the goals that we conceded, but we showed a lot of resilience to come back and win the game. Credit to all the players, the staff, it's been a journey to get here. We now hold our own destiny, trying to reach that top four spot,\" Pride head coach Seb Hines told the media after the game.The Spirit took control of the game in the first half and carried a narrow lead into halftime. The initial go-ahead goal was crafted by Italy international Sofia Cantore with a backheel.\nThe highlight-worthy goal was the last time the Spirit would lead the game. Orlando's second-half comeback was sparked by Brazilian international Marta off the bench. The 39-year-old attacker's impact was instant, getting on the ball from the whistle, putting on the moves in the box, and taking a cheeky shot that deflected off Spirit midfielder Narumi Miura and into the goal.\nThe veteran player later converted a game-winning penalty kick with composure that sent goalkeeper Aubrey Kingsbury the opposite direction. Pride forward Ally Watt earned the penalty after a foul inside the box was committed by Spirit defender Kysha Sylla. Marta's penalty goal makes her the oldest player to score from the spot in NWSL history.\n\"To bring on a player with her quality, she's an attacking player. She wants to get forward, she wants to score goals, you know, make an immediate impact off the bench. We have to manage her and her loads because she played high minutes on Wednesday night against Pachuca. We felt we needed a bit of a spark, and she certainly brought that,\" Hines said. \n\"And then showing that sort of composure in front of goal with the penalty. You know, she's been in those moments many of times. She's obviously faced Aubrey [Kingsbury] many of times in that position as well. And she calmly slots it away. So yeah, really pleased with her, really happy that we've got her back firing in such a pivotal moment in the season.\"The Pride, who struggled after returning from the mid-season break and lost their leading goal scorer, Barbra Banda, to a season-ending injury, are now on a four-game unbeaten streak with the playoffs just a few weeks away. They have three wins in their last five matches, and will have a final regular-season game on Nov. 2. If the league standings remain the same, there could be a future semifinal meeting between the Spirit and Orlando.It would be the third high-stakes match that the two sides play against each other in a year. The two last met in November during the 2024 NWSL Championship, with Orlando the victors, and again in March during the 2025 NWSL Challenge Cup, with the Spirit achieving a bit of revenge following the championship final. It's the thing that sparks rivalry naturally, and something a young league like NWSL craves. \nThe chaotic back-and-forth of Saturday's match just adds more lore to the recent meetings between the two sides. The Spirit recently lost dynamic winger Trinity Rodman just days before the match to an injury. She sustained a grade 1 MCL sprain during a Concacaf W Champions Cup on Wednesday, and the club confirmed she'll be evaluated. The Spirit roster is not unfamiliar with navigating stretches of the season without Rodman. The franchise player was away from the team for several months as she managed a lingering back injury. She had just returned to playing regularly in August and was recently named to the USWNT roster, though she will now miss out on the international window. Fans eager to see the two sides battle again will have to hold out hope for a potential semifinal meeting, as the Spirit are hopeful to have Rodman for the playoffs. The recent games are just an example of the high-level competition between them. \n\"Anytime we play Washington, it's always an emotional game. It's very competitive. Both teams are going after it. So, yeah, it's for the neutrals. It was a good game,\" Hines joked. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Two teams that are having vastly opposite seasons are squaring off Sunday in the Windy City. After an 0-2 start, the Chicago Bears have won three straight games and are right in the thick of things in the NFC North. Conversely, the opponent on Sunday, the New Orleans Saints, are hoping to play the role of spoiler as it enters Chicago with a record of just 1-5. Bet Bears vs. Saints at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass with a winning $5 wager:Both teams are being led by first-year coaches. Kellen Moore picked up his first win with the Saints in Week 5, when New Orleans forced five turnovers in a 26-14 upset win over the Giants. Ben Johnson is trying to lead the Bears to their first winning season since 2018, when then-first year head coach Matt Nagy led Chicago to a 12-4 record. \nHere's how you can follow the action in real time, along with a breakdown and a prediction for Sunday. Where to watch Saints vs. Bears liveWhen: Sunday, Oct. 19 | Time: 1 p.m. ETWhere: Soldier Field -- Chicago, Illinois TV: FOX | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Bears -5.5; O/U 46.5 (via FanDuel)Saints vs. Bears: Need to know Defense, anyone? Neither team can say that defense has been their strength so far this season. The Saints and Bears are currently 25th and 27th in the NFL in most points allowed, respectively. Ironically, they are both 24th in the NFL in red zone efficiency after allowing 12 touchdowns in 18 opponents' trips into the 20-yard-line. One big difference between the units has been on third down. The Bears' defense is third in the NFL in that area, whereas the Saints are just 24th in the NFL in that area. Offensive edge. The Bears have a clear advantage on offense. They are currently 10th in the NFL in scoring, whereas the Saints are the fifth-worst team in the NFL with an average of 18.5 points per outing. Quarterback play has a major reason why the Bears' offense has had more success this season. Second-year quarterback Caleb Williams has largely played well and has done a good job taking care of the football. And while Saints QB Spencer Rattler has also done a good job in terms of not throwing interceptions, he's averaging just one touchdown pass per game. \nWhen in Rome. Chicago has enjoyed a breakout sophomore season from wideout Rome Odunze, who has already caught more touchdown passes this season (5) than he did during his entire rookie campaign (3). One Saints advantage. One of the Saints' advantages entering this game is their pass rush. Led by Carl Granderson's 4.5 sacks, New Orleans' defense has sacked opposing quarterbacks five more time this season than the Bears, who have just seven sacks though five games. Saints vs. Bears prediction, pick \nLed by Alvin Kamara and wideouts Chris Olave and Rashid Shaheed, the Saints have enough offensive weapons to keep things close on Sunday. That being said, I'm going with the Bears in this one, largely due to their advantage on offense.  Pick: Bears -5.5; Under 46.5\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The New England Patriots are in a position they haven't been in for a while -- first place in the AFC East. They look to keep that divisional lead this week when they face the Tennessee Titans, who just happen to be the former team of current Patriots current coach Mike Vrabel.But the biggest news out of Tennessee this week wasn't the Vrabel homecoming, it was the firing of head coach Brian Callahan. The Titans interim head coach is Mike McCoy, the team's senior offensive assistant. Bet Patriots vs. Titans at BetMGM Sportsbook, where new users get up to $1,500 in bonus bets back if their first wager doesn't win with the promo code CBSSPORTS:The Patriots currently sit at 4-2, coming off a win over the New Orleans Saints. The Titans are 1-5, coming off a loss to the Arizona Cardinals. The Patriots are undefeated on the road this season (3-0).Here's how to watch the game live, along with odds for the matchup.\nWhere to watch Titans vs. Patriots liveDate: Sunday, Oct. 19 | Time: 1 p.m. ET Location: Nissan Stadium -- Nashville, Tennessee TV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+ Follow: CBS Sports App Odds: Patriots -7; O/U 42.5 (via DraftKings)    Titans vs. Patriots: Need to knowThe Titans coaching carousel. The Titans hired Vrabel in 2018 and not long after he won Coach of the Year in 2021, the team fired him and hired Callahan, who lasted just 23 games in Tennessee. Now, right after they fired their coach, the Titans are hosting their former coach who is in the process of turning a team around, something Tennessee fans may find difficult to watch.Drake Maye makes history. Drake Maye joined elite company last week when he joined Patrick Mahomes and Dan Marino are the only quarterbacks under 24 to record at least 200 passing yards and a passer rating of over 100 in five straight games. Maye looks like the real deal and he's only strengthening his bond with his receivers. Heading into Week 7, Maye has 1,522 yards, 10 touchdowns and just two interceptions. Cam Ward may have a challenging day. Ward joined a long list of other first overall selections who had their coach fired midseason. Ward is only a few games into his NFL career, but that doesn't mean people don't expect him to be a star already. Immediate success has become something demanded in the league, but Ward will likely need more time. The 2025 No. 1 overall pick has yet to prove whether he can be \"the guy\" for Tennessee as his stat line -- 55.5 completion percentage, 1,101 yards, three touchdowns and four interceptions -- would indicate. This defense will not be an easy one for Ward to face and with Calvin Ridley's health in question, it could be a long day for the offense.\nTitans vs. Patriots prediction, pick\nThe Patriots have the benefit of facing a team in their first week with an interim coach. While this firing should light a fire in the Titans' locker room, the Patriots have the clear upper hand. I expect Maye to continue his impressive campaign and put up solid numbers this year. Pick: Patriots -7, Over 42.5\n            ",

    "body": "\n        During a regular season defined by widespread parity, it's starting to feel like we might be headed toward debut College Football Playoff appearances from two teams that faced off in last year's Birmingham Bowl -- Vanderbilt and Georgia Tech.The No. 17 Commodores snapped a decades-long drought Saturday, beating LSU for the first time since 1990. Coupled with No. 12 Georgia Tech's road win at Duke, both teams have surged to the front of the pack in the SEC and ACC, respectively. Vanderbilt's second top-25 win this season moved it to 6-1 overall, with three ranked opponents still ahead -- Missouri, Texas and Tennessee -- along with Kentucky and Auburn.For the Yellow Jackets, Miami's loss to Louisville on Friday night blew the ACC race wide open, giving Georgia Tech a potential storybook path as the season turns toward November.The Yellow Jackets (7-0) don't face another ranked opponent the rest of the way and are one of only three unbeaten teams in ACC play — joining SMU and Virginia — entering Saturday's games. Georgia Tech won't face either of those teams this season and was featured in last week's CBS Sports playoff projections.\nWith the playoff selection committee's first rankings just a couple of weeks away, both the Commodores and Yellow Jackets could find themselves comfortably inside the top 15 if they stay on course.Vanderbilt's playoff pathGiven Commodores' beefed up schedule, a 4-1 record over their final five SEC games to finish 10-2 on the season would be enough to warrant a playoff bid. That would give Vanderbilt at least four wins over ranked teams this fall, which would dwarf the number of most playoff entries.Next week's titanic matchup against Missouri could be Vanderbilt's first this season as a top-10 team depending on where AP voters slot the Commodores on Sunday. Road trips to Texas and Tennessee follow in November. That game at Neyland Stadium on Nov. 29 could potentially be a playoff play-in game of sorts for both teams.\nCredit Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia's confidence this season. He said in July at SEC Media Days everyone inside the Commodores' program felt they could win the national championship, a take that was laughed at nationally -- and look who's still in the playoff mix after eight weeks. Georgia Tech's decisive stretchThe Yellow Jackets are guaranteed a playoff appearance if they win out --  which would include a victory over Georgia during rivalry weekend. The home win over then-ranked Clemson last month kickstarted this banner start for Brent Key and Co., and quarterback Haynes King's leadership has persevered throughout.Thanks to Omar DAniels' school-record 95-yard fumble return for a touchdown against the Blue Devils, Georgia Tech led early before a decisive fourth quarter pushed the team to its fourth ACC victory. Georgia Tech will be favored over its final four conference games against Syracuse, NC State, Boston College and Pitt prior to the finale in Atlanta against the Bulldogs.\n            ",

The Browns are currently on a three-game losing streak, while the Dolphins have lost back-to-back games.The Browns have a solid defense, but their offense has a hard time getting anything going and turns the ball over too often, coming in with six interceptions. Cleveland hasn't scored more than 17 points in a game this year. Bet Browns vs. Dolphins at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass with a winning $5 wager:The Dolphins offense isn't much better, tied for the the third most interceptions in the league (7). Miami's lone win this year is against the winless Jets. The frustration around these two teams is palpable six weeks into the season. Here's a look at everything you need to know for the game, including betting odds and how to watch the matchup live.\nWhere to watch Dolphins vs. Browns liveDate: Sunday, Oct. 19 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: Huntington Bank Field -- Cleveland, OhioTV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Dolphins +2.5; O/U 40.5 (via DraftKings)    Dolphins vs. Browns: Need to knowTua trouble. This week, Tua Tagovailoa called out his teammates, saying many have been late or absent to player only meetings. The comments gave some insight into the dysfunction that may be going on in the locker room, but also may have rubbed some in the building the wrong way. More issues for Browns at QB. The Browns quarterback situation hasn't been smooth this season, keeping in theme with how their recent history has gone. They are already on their second QB of the season and their original starter isn't even on the team anymore. The Browns traded Joe Flacco to the Cincinnati Bengals, leaving rookie Dillon Gabriel in charge of the offense, with rookie Shadeur Sanders as the backup. Gabriel finished 29 of 52 with 221 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions. It's certainly not the worst showing, but it wasn't enough to get the win against the Steelers. Mike McDaniel is on the hot seat. We just saw the Titans fire their head coach after a rough start to the season and the Dolphins could certainly be next. McDaniel got the coaching gig in 2022 and even in the years he seemed to have a capable team, he hasn't been able to record a postseason win in his time in the 305.\nDolphins vs. Browns prediction, pick\nThis one could go either way, given that these are two struggling teams with a lot to fix. Still, I'm taking the Fins in this one. Pick: Dolphins +2.5; under 40.5\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The College Football Playoff rankings are guaranteed to see one of their biggest shake-ups of the season after a Week 8 that threw the entire AP Top 25 poll into a blender.Some of it was inevitable, as every AP Top 25 team was in action this weekend, and the teams that finished No. 26 (Michigan) and No. 27 (Washington) faced each other. In total, Week 8 featured five ranked-on-ranked matchups and nine total losses by ranked teams. So when the new AP Top 25 is released on Sunday, expect plenty of movement in the rankings.As for the headliners, it's hard to get past what Clark Lea has done at Vanderbilt -- and what the Commodores are set to do on Sunday -- following their win over LSU. According to our research, Vanderbilt has never been ranked higher than No. 10 in the AP Top 25 poll, and our projection is that they'll land higher than that as one of the top one-loss teams in the poll.\n        \n            \n                Bowl projections: Miami, Texas Tech lose grip in College Football Playoff picture, Georgia Tech flourishes\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHere's how we expect the new AP Top 25 to look on Sunday after Week 8: 1. Ohio State (Last week — 1): If the Buckeyes want to boast that they have the best defense in the country, there is certainly more evidence for it in Saturday's 34-0 win at Wisconsin. Ohio State is allowing 5.9 points per game this season and has yet to give up 17 in a single game, helping balance what it already a hyper-talented offense that seems to be getting more comfortable each week with Julian Sayin at quarterback. \n2. Indiana (3): We are starting to see some seriously award-winning work from Hoosiers quarterback Fernando Mendoza, who threw for 332 yards and four touchdowns in a 25-point win against Michigan State the week after winning on the road at Oregon. It's hard to win over first-place votes from a conference rival, but the move to No. 2 alone will make more program history as the highest-ever AP Top 25 ranking for Indiana football. 3. Texas A&M (4): Some seriously inclement weather conditions preceded a high-scoring back-and-forth at Arkansas, but the Aggies held strong with answers at every turn to improve to 7-0 on the year.  4. Alabama (6): It's just a slight bump in the rankings but it's a big hurdle to cross for an Alabama team that is clearly in the mix for title contention here in 2025. The Crimson Tide handled business against rival Tennessee and now prepares for its home stretch of the season looking to secure the College Football Playoff bid that eluded Kalen DeBoer a year ago.  \n5. Oregon (8): This is a great response from the Ducks after last week's loss to Indiana, as Oregon had to bounce back and travel across the country to New Jersey for a quick turnaround against Rutgers. The 56-10 result speaks to the focus of an Oregon team that's not going to let one loss impact the rest of the season, and it will keep them safely inside the top 10 heading into Week 9. 6. Georgia (9): The 2025 edition of Kirby Smart's Bulldogs aren't winning games the way we're accustomed to seeing from his title-contending program. Shootout victories against Ole Miss on Saturday and Tennessee earlier this season show that the Dawgs can win lots of ways and that could be a benefit to achieving their ultimate goal in the 12-team College Football Playoff era. 7. Vanderbilt (17): As we mentioned earlier, history is set to be made as Vanderbilt will almost certainly set a new school record for highest-ever AP Top 25 poll ranking. The ceiling for Vanderbilt's rise will be Alabama, the only team that it's lost to this season, but the floor is LSU's previous ranking just on the outside of the top 10.  \n8. Ole Miss (5): Losing a close back-and-forth game on the road to Georgia isn't going to come with too much punishment from the voters, but there will be a downgrade for the Rebels. 9. Georgia Tech (12): Brent Key's group is set to break into the top 10 after holding through a slow start in Durham and pulling away for an impressive win against Duke.  10. Miami (2): We are projecting that Miami hangs on inside the top 10 in part because of the head-to-head win against Notre Dame, which continues to hold value as the Fighting Irish surge continues.  \n11. Notre Dame (13): Marcus Freeman's team was ready for the elements on Saturday night and the Fighting Irish battled through the wind and rain for a hard-fought win against USC to improve to 5-2 on the year. 12. Oklahoma (14): The Sooners needed a strong bounce back after the Red River Rivalry loss to Texas and they got it with a 26-7 victory at South Carolina. It was a win that affirmed, if nothing else, that this years Oklahoma team will be led and driven by its defense as they applied relentless pressure to help keep South Carolina from ever threatening for an upset at home. 13. BYU (15): The Cougars are set to move up after a huge rivalry win against Utah. \n14. Missouri (16): The Tigers held on in double overtime and escaped with a win at Auburn to improve to 6-1 on the season.  15. Tennessee (11): The Volunteers boast another quality loss resume that voters will have to consider after a 37-20 loss at Alabama. There are no wins against teams that are close to being in the top 25 but it's also a team that only has lost against Georgia, by three, and the Tide, on the road. 16. Virginia (18): Consider this an avoided disaster for Virginia, which escaped with a 22-20 win against Washington State thanks to a game-winning safety. The Wahoos were coming out of an off week hoping to be healthier and ready for a run at the ACC Championship, but Washington State continued its recent run of putting a scare in power conference opponents and pushed UVA to the brink. As it is, Virginia improves to 6-1 overall holds on to its spot in the top 25. \n17. South Florida (19): The Bulls showed no signs of a hangover from last week's key win in Denton, throttling FAU 48-13 to improve to 6-1 overall and remain undefeated in conference play.  18. Texas Tech (7): There is obviously going to be a drop for Texas Tech following the road loss to Arizona State, but the damage could limited by the fact that it was just the first loss of the season for the Red Raiders. A head-to-head win against Utah provides some cushion in terms of where they land on the fall, as does the confidence that voters had when putting them firmly in the mix for a top-five spot one week ago. 19. Texas (21): Voters didn't get much in terms of reasons to believe in Texas as a top 25 team from their Week 8 performance, because a 13-10 overtime win at Kentucky does not line up with the quality win the Longhorns logged against Oklahoma last week. There could be some shuffling on the ballots as all positions are up for grabs, but in the consensus we're going to guess not much change in the pecking order among two-loss teams. \n20. Cincinnati (24): The Bearcats backed up their recent success with no signs of a letdown, handing Oklahoma State a 32-point defeat in Stillwater. 21. Louisville (NR): There is only one loss on Louisville's resume and it's against Virginia, so the Cards are going to break into the rankings and be set by the Wahoos status after taking down Miami on Friday night. 22. Illinois (NR): The Fighting Illini were off in Week 8 but after being No. 26 in last week's balloting should have a clear path into the top 25 as one of the top two loss teams in the country. \n23. Michigan (NR): The Wolverines bounced back from last week's loss to USC with a win against Washington, which was previously the No. 28 team in voting points in last week's ranking. 24. Arizona State (NR): On one hand, the Sun Devils are 5-2 with losses to two teams, Utah and Mississippi State, who both lost on Saturday. But on the other, this is also a group that just handed Texas Tech its first loss of the season. So while all of the head-to-head matchups don't line up exactly, there's enough quality to the profile to get Arizona State back into the top 25 after taking down the Red Raiders. 25. LSU (10): This is a complex resume for voters to parse, because while LSU has lost close games to a couple of ranked teams (Ole Miss and Vanderbilt) on the road, it also doesn't have a bevy of quality wins to justify a top 25 ranking. Ultimately our projection is that the quality losses do enough work to avoid falling all the way out of the rankings but this is a team that will be on the chopping block for many voters' ballots.  \nProjected to drop out: No. 20 USC, No. 22 Memphis, No. 23 Utah, No. 25 Nebraska \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Are you ready for another full day of NFL action? Sunday's slate once again gets started a bit earlier than usual with a third straight London game on deck, this time between the Los Angeles Rams and Jacksonville Jaguars. After that, there are a number of intriguing matchups on deck, so it's important that you have all of your bets locked in before kickoff. And that's where we come in to lend a helping hand. Below, you can find our five best bets for Week 7 that include a pick in the Eagles-Vikings matchup, along with determining if the Kansas City Chiefs -- re-armed with wideout Rashee Rice -- can cover the double-digit spread against the Las Vegas Raiders. On top of those bets bets, we'll also provide our picks for every other game on the slate. Happy betting! Teams with bye weeks in Week 7: Buffalo Bills and Baltimore RavensNFL odds via DraftKings Sportsbook (unless otherwise noted).

They are also facing a Titans team playing their first game after firing head coach Brian Callahan, which is typically a situation where clubs respond well the following game. That said, is Mike Vrabel really going to lose his first game against a Tennessee franchise that fired him after the 2023 season? The Patriots head coach should be dialed in for this matchup, and I expect the players in the locker room will also be motivated to win this game for Vrabel. \nNew England is also far superior -- it's playing like a top 10 team in the NFL at the moment -- with Drake Maye putting up top five numbers at the quarterback position.  On the other side, Cam Ward has struggled as the No. 1 overall pick: he has a league-worst 55% completion rate and ranks bottom three in the league in yards per attempt (5.5) and touchdown-to-interception ratio (3-to-4). Going up against a New England defense that is 3-0 and allowing just 17.3 points per game since All-Pro corner Christian Gonzalez returned, it could be another long day at the office for Tennessee. Projected score: Patriots 30, Titans 17The pick: Patriots -7New Orleans Saints at Chicago Bears (-4.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. (Fox | Fubo, try for free)I think Caleb Williams is going to be particularly motivated for this game against New Orleans and, more specifically, Spencer Rattler. This will be the first time these former Oklahoma quarterbacks will face one another since their position battle with the Sooners. Rattler started over Williams to begin the 2020 season, but Williams eventually got the nod during the sixth game of that campaign. Williams started the rest of that year, and Rattler eventually transferred to South Carolina. Williams admitted in 2024 that he was \"so angry\" starting the season as the backup to Rattler at the time, and I wonder if that feeling will linger in this game with a desire to continue to prove that he was the top quarterback in that room. On top of the motivation factor from Williams, I like the way Chicago is playing. It has won three straight coming into Week 7 and is averaging 2.4 takeaways per game (most in the NFL). That should match up well against Rattler's Saints, with the quarterback 0-5 on the road as the starter and his offense averaging just 11.8 points per game. Meanwhile, Williams is 7-3-1 ATS at home in his career. \nProjected score: Bears 27, Saints 20The pick: Bears -4.5\n        \n            \n                NFL Week best bets: Mike Vrabel wins revenge game vs. Titans, Dillon Gabriel scores first win\n                \n                    Jordan Dajani                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nPhiladelphia Eagles at Minnesota Vikings (+1.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. (Fox | Fubo, try for free)It's hard for me to back the Eagles at this stage, particularly on the road. The offense continues to look lost and is averaging just 274.5 yards per game (third-fewest in the NFL). The club has been outgained in every game this season and has been outscored 52-17 in the last five quarters. This offense is expected to rebound against a Vikings defense that is fifth in the NFL in points per game allowed (19.4), sixth in yards per game allowed (289.8), and second in third-down efficiency (30%)? I don't see it. Meanwhile, the Vikings are 9-2 at home since the start of last season, which includes a 2-0 record as a home underdog. The club is 4-1 straight up as an underdog since 2024. Projected score: Vikings 23, Eagles 20The pick: Vikings +1.5Carolina Panthers at New York Jets (+1.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. (Fox | Fubo, try for free)The Jets initially opened as the favorite in this matchup, but the odds have swung toward Carolina. While it's hard to fault anyone for fading the Jets after an abysmal performance in London last week, this is a sneaky good spot for them to notch their first win of 2025. The Panthers are a dramatically different team on the road than they are at home. This season, Carolina is 0-3 on the road and is averaging just 15 points per game on offense while allowing 31.7 points per game on defense. Bryce Young is just 1-15 on the road in his career as a starter. If this continues, Justin Fields won't be asked to do anything beyond his capabilities as a passer, and New York could control a low-scoring game. \nAfter all, the Jets did play well on defense and on special teams last week, to the point where they nearly pulled off the upset despite issues on offense. Those two areas could continue to shine, and if they get remotely competent play from Fields and Co., it'll result in the first win for head coach Aaron Glenn. Projected score: Jets 20, Panthers 17The pick: Jets +1.5Las Vegas Raiders at Kansas City Chiefs (-11.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET (CBS | Paramount+)Don't look now, but the Kansas City Chiefs have clawed back to .500, the offense is coming alive, and the team is set to welcome back standout receiver Rashee Rice from his six-game suspension. K.C. has gone 3-1 since beginning the year at 0-2 and takes on a Raiders team that hasn't impressed at all this season, despite bringing in veteran quarterback Geno Smith and respected head coach Pete Carroll. Smith has an NFL-high 10 interceptions and the offense is averaging just 17.2 points per game (29th in the league). That won't be good enough against a Chiefs offense that is starting to heat up and is getting a key weapon back in the fold. That's also not mentioning Patrick Mahomes' 12-2 record against the Raiders in his career. I expect Kansas City to cover the double-digit spread. \nProjected score: Chiefs 33, Raiders 21The pick: Chiefs -11.5Odds via Caesars Sportsbook.

    "body": "\n        The picks have leveled off some after a good start, which is never a good thing.I went 6-9 against the spread last week and 9-6 straight up. That's not good considering the first five weeks of the season had me nicely above .500 for both. The 6-9 ATS record felt a lot worse, too. It just wasn't pretty. That brings my ATS record to 49-44 on the season -- still above .500 in a tough year -- and my straight-up record is now 66-26-1.It's not good. It's not bad. It just is. So let's hope the string of mediocrity changes this week.

The Seattle line sacked Trevor Lawrence seven times in that game. The Rams' defensive front has to be licking its chops. The Los Angeles offense will be without Puka Nacua, its best receiver. That matters. The Jaguars will pull one out late. Pick: Jaguars 24, Rams 21 | Odds via BetMGMCarolina Panthers at New York Jets (+2)Sunday, 1 p.m. on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Panthers head out on the road as favorites for the first time since 2022. The Jets are winless, so there's the reason. They also haven't played well. The Panthers are physical on both lines, but I think the Jets will be up to it. They will limit the run game and win with their defense.  Pick: Jets 20, Panthers 17 | Odds via Caesars SportsbookLas Vegas Raiders at Kansas City Chiefs (-11.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThe Chiefs are big favorites here for a reason. They are getting the offense cranked up and will have Rashee Rice back to add to it. The Raiders have defensive issues, which Patrick Mahomes will use to his advantage. Geno Smith won't keep up and will continue to turn it over. Chiefs big.   Pick: Chiefs 35, Raiders 20 | Odds via FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 bet:Miami Dolphins at Cleveland Browns (-2.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThis is the dog game of the day between two bottom feeders. The Browns haven't done much on offense with Dillon Gabriel playing, but the Dolphins defense will be the perfect tonic. They can't stop anybody. The Browns defense can. That's the difference. Pick: Browns 26, Dolphins 23 | Odds via DraftKings SportsbookNew England Patriots at Tennessee Titans (+7)Sunday, 1 p.m. on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nFormer Titans coach Mike Vrabel takes his Patriots team to Nashville to play his old team. The Titans are reeling having fired coach Brian Callahan this week. They aren't playing well, but New England is for sure. But this is a third straight road game for the Patriots. That's tough. Titans will hang around as they get the interim-coach bump.Pick: Patriots 23, Titans 19 | Odds via Caesars Sportsbook\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 7 picks and score predictions: Bengals shock Steelers, Rams top Jaguars in London\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nNew Orleans Saints at Chicago Bears (-5.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Bears are 3-2 coming off an impressive road victory against the Commanders. Caleb Williams is playing good football for Chicago. The Saints have hung around in games and Spencer Rattler is coming off a good game last week. But this will be the Bears pulling it out in the second half behind Williams. Pick: Bears 27, Saints 20 | Odds via BetMGMPhiladelphia Eagles at Minnesota Vikings (+2.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Eagles have lost two straight and just don't look right. The Vikings are coming off a bye, and might have quarterback J.J. McCarthy back. If not, it's Carson Wentz. It doesn't matter. This will come down to the Eagles getting Saquon Barkley going and he will run through the Vikings. Eagles will win a tight one.   Pick: Eagles 24, Vikings 22 | Odds via Caesars Sportsbook, where new users get 20 100% profit boosts with the code CBS20X:Indianapolis Colts at Los Angeles Chargers (-1.5)Sunday, 4:05 p.m. on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThis is an enormous game for these two, and especially a prove-it game for the Colts since they have played a softer schedule. They have been impressive, but this will be a challenge. I think the Chargers and Justin Herbert will be up to it. This will be fun to watch with a lot of points.Pick: Chargers 34, Colts 27 | Odds via BetMGMNew York Giants at Denver Broncos (-7)Sunday, 4:05 p.m. on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThe Giants are rested after beating the Eagles last Thursday, while Denver is back from a trip overseas. Advantage, Giants. But this will be a tough test for Giants rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart. The Denver defense leads the NFL in sacks. That will be the difference as they speed him up and force turnovers.   Pick: Broncos 28, Giants 16 | Odds via DraftKings SportsbookGreen Bay Packers (-6.5) at Arizona CardinalsSunday, 4:25 p.m. on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThere is a good chance this could be Jacoby Brissett starting again for the injured Kyler Murray at quarterback. Brissett played well last week in the loss to the Colts, but this Green Bay defense will be a tougher test. Look for the Green Bay offense to get it going in the passing game as well. Packers win it. Pick: Packers 31, Cardinals 23 | Odds via Caesars SportsbookWashington Commanders (-1.5) at Dallas CowboysSunday, 4:25 p.m. on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nBoth of these teams are coming off tough losses, while the Commanders are playing on a short week out on the road. That's tough to do. But the Dallas defense is so bad right now that it won't matter. This will be a shootout, but the Commanders and Jayden Daniels will get the best of it against Dak Prescott. Pick: Commanders 34, Cowboys 30 | Odds via FanDuel SportsbookAtlanta Falcons at San Francisco 49ers (-2.5)Sunday, 8:20 p.m. on NBC (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Falcons are on a short week having played Monday, but the 49ers are so banged up. There is a chance Brock Purdy can be back after missing the past two games with a toe injury. That matters. The Falcons have a fierce pass rush these days, so that will challenge Kyle Shanahan to call a game to minimize it. I think he does, and the 49ers take advantage of a team on the road on a short week.   Pick: 49ers 23, Falcons 19 | Odds via FanDuel SportsbookTampa Bay Buccaneers (+5.5) at Detroit LionsMonday, 7 p.m. ET on ABC (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThis is a big game in terms of NFC dominance. Both teams have a lot of injury issues, yet they have fought through them. The Bucs are the top seed right now in the NFC because of Baker Mayfield. With Jared Goff also rolling up big numbers, this has the look of a game with a lot of points. I see the Lions winning a close one.Pick: Lions 35, Buccaneers 34 | Odds via DraftKings SportsbookHouston Texans at Seattle Seahawks (-3.5)Monday, 10 p.m. ET on ESPN (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Seahawks looked dominant in their win at Jacksonville last week, especially on defense. Quarterback Sam Darnold also continues to play well, but he will face a tough Houston defense. The Texans are off a bye, so they are rested. But I think this will come down to the Seattle front getting the best of the Houston offensive line. Poor C.J. Stroud.   Pick: Seahawks 23, Texans 17 | Odds via DraftKings Sportsbook\n            ",

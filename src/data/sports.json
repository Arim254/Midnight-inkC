SportsLine's proven computer model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model entered the 2026 NFL playoffs on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024.Monday Wild Card Weekend betting preview, picksSteelers (+3) vs. TexansThe strength of the AFC North is a driving force behind this line, but the fact remains that Pittsburgh is an incredibly hostile environment, and Houston hasn't won a road playoff game in franchise history. Aaron Rodgers will be making his 22nd career playoff start on Monday, and he'll have the experience advantage even though C.J. Stroud has quickly piled up postseason reps (this is his fifth start in only his third season). DK Metcalf is back from suspension and T.J. Watt is healthy at the right time, which are big reasons why the model says that the Steelers cover in 53% of simulations. Bet on the Steelers at FanDuel, where new users get $300 if your first bet of at least $5 wins:Over 38.5 pointsThe Texans ranked second in the NFL in scoring defense and first in total defense this season, and Rodgers isn't as menacing at 42 as he was even four years ago when he ripped off back-to-back NFL MVPs. However, the Steelers have still managed to score 25 points or more in nine of their last 12 games, and the Houston offense has also produced 36 points or more on four occasions this season. If this game opens up even a little bit, this number could be in the rear-view in a hurry, and the model predicts that the Over hits in 55% of simulations, with 42 projected points. Bet the Over at Caesars Sportsbook, where new users get your first bet up to $250 in bonus bets, whether it wins or loses.Responsible gamingResponsible gaming is a serious topic, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users play responsibly.

    "body": "\n        After a 0-2 start in SEC play, the No. 12 LSU Tigers shook off all doubts with a statement 70-65 victory over No. 2 Texas on Sunday. This was the Longhorns' first loss of the season, and also LSU's first win over an AP top two team since 2008.\"I'm sure you've heard, but coach (Kim) Mulkey says she wants us to be tough,\" Mikaylah Williams said in her postgame broadcast interview. \"And I think that's something we've really taken pride in after those first two losses. Being tough, sticking together and playing hard. That's something that we've done and that's something we've been successful at so far.\"The sold-out crowd in Baton Rouge was electric all 40 minutes, but they exploded when Williams practically sealed the deal with a three-pointer that made it a three-possession game with just 1:18 remaining. This was just another example of the impact she had on Sunday. She had a complete performance that included 20 points, 7 rebounds, 4 assists and 5 steals.\nHere is a closer look at how LSU upset Texas:A stifling defense that shut down Rori HarmonThe Tigers got off to a rough start offensively as they went just 7 of 26 from the field, but their defense made sure Texas didn't get hot either. \nLSU held the Longhorns to 25 points in the first two quarters, which is their lowest scoring half this season. Although Texas has one of the top assists/turnover ratios in the country, the team finished Sunday with a season-high 17 turnovers and just 9 assists.Jordan Lee has been one of the most consistent players for Texas, but she only made three field goals all day. Meanwhile, point guard Rori Harmon had just two points, going 1 of 7 from the field. Harmon sat out the entire fourth quarter after Vic Schaefer decided to go with Bryanna Preston.\nLimiting Madison Booker, especially in the first halfBooker was the spark for a Texas comeback attempt in the fourth quarter, but despite finishing the day with 24 points on 10 of 16 shooting, those stats don't tell the whole story. LSU's defense, with Williams being a key part of it, limited Booker to just four points and three turnovers in the first half. She also had two fouls in those first two quarters and was dangerously close to fouling out as she picked up her fourth early in the fourth quarter.\nDespite the loss, Booker is already thinking about how to lock in and bounce back when the Longhorns take on South Carolina.\"Coach said it, we are not ready for Thursday,\" Booker said postgame. \"We are still going to come no matter what, but we have to get ready. We have to prepare again and we have to try to fix our mistakes.\"Fighting for reboundsLSU no longer has Angel Reese or Aneesah Morrow to take over in the rebounding category. Kim Mulkey has been talking all season about how she wants the whole team to make a conscious effort in this area, and they did just that against Texas. LSU won the battle on the boards 44-35, which means the Tigers' grueling practices have paid off.\n\"We've had practices with a rebound bubble on, so the ball can't go in so you have to rebound,\" Williams said postgame. \"If you didn't get it, there was running involved. \"I'm proud of how we rebounded today.\"\nShowcasing depth, with five players scored in double digitsWilliams was the star of the show on Sunday, but there were multiple Tigers who stepped up during big moments. Four other LSU players joined her in the double-digit club with 10 points each, including Jada Richard, who hit a stunning buzzer-beater at the end of the second quarter following a steal and dime from Williams.\nFlau'jae Johnson was coming off her highest scoring game of the season in the win against Georgia. She only made four field goals against Texas but her impact was still felt throughout the game. When the Longhorns were working on a comeback, Johnson got an and-one with 7:15 remaining to keep injecting energy into her team and the crowd. The 5-foot-10 guard also got the crowd going with a block against 6-foot-6 center Kyla Oldacre later in the fourth quarter.\nMiLaysia Fulwiley is still cleaning up aspects of her games, but her moves also make the game exciting. Another key bench player is ZaKiyah Johnson, who Richard described her as a \"dog\" postgame.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        A UEFA Women's Champions League superstar and U.S. women's national team captain returns home. Denver Summit FC announced the signing of Colorado native Lindsey Heaps on Monday. The midfielder will join Summit FC following the conclusion of her 2025-26 campaign with OL Lyonnes. The U.S. midfielder has 170 appearances with the USWNT, is a 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup, 2024 Olympic gold, and 2020 Olympic bronze medalist. She has aided the national team in winning multiple Concacaf trophies, won the U.S. Soccer Female Player of the Year in 2021, and was named to he Best FIFA Women's XI in 2024. \"I'm incredibly excited to come home to Colorado and join Denver Summit FC,\" Heaps said. \"This club represents something special, not just for the league, but for this community and for the next generation of players growing up here. I'm fully committed to finishing the season strong with Lyon, and I can't wait to begin this next chapter in Denver this summer.\"A double homecomingHeaps, born in Golden, Colorado, will have a double homecoming of sorts when she returns in the summer -- first to her home state as a product of Colorado's youth system, and also back to the NWSL. \n\"Signing Lindsey Heaps is a defining moment for Denver Summit FC,\" said Denver Summit FC General Manager Curt Johnson. \"She represents the very highest level of excellence as a player, a leader, and a professional. To welcome her back home to Colorado and to have her help shape the identity of this club is incredibly meaningful.\"The 31-year-old midfielder made headlines as a teenager when she turned down her University of North Carolina scholarship to turn pro and start her club career with Paris Saint-Germain in 2012. Following a four-year stint in France, she signed with Portland Thorns FC in 2016 and won several accolades in nearly every season with the club, including the NWSL Shield (2016, 2021), NWSL Championship (2017), NWSL Challenge Cup (2021), and NWSL MVP (2018) before her departure in 2022 to OL Lyonnes.\"Lindsey will bring a world-class level to our team and represents the ambition of this club on-and-off the field,\" said Summit FC Head Coach Nick Cushing. \"Lindsey has won at every level of the game. Her leadership, talent, and professionalism will continue to raise the standard for Summit FC when she arrives this summer. We are thrilled to welcome a hometown player back to Denver as we work to win championships and grow our club and community.\"\nWhen will Lindsey Heaps debut for Denver?The midfielder is to join Summit FC following completion of her season with OL Lyonnes, and the NWSL's newest expansion franchise expects the midfielder's arrival in June. She's currently competing with the French side domestically and in the 2025-26 UEFA Women's Champions League.Heaps has already been part of several trophies with the European giants during her time with the club. She's won three Division 1 Féminine titles, a UWCL title, and the Coupe de France Féminine. Her signing is considered a high-profile addition to Denver's expansion roster building.While the club expects her arrival in June, when she makes her first appearance as a member of Summit FC is another thing entirely. The league has already announced that it will take a summer break during the men's 2026 FIFA World Cup from June 1 through 28. The month-long pause means regular-season games will likely resume the first weekend of July. \nWhen will Denver Summit play its first home game?The complete NWSL schedule is set for release at a later date, but the league unveiled a blueprint with key dates. Officially NWSL's 16th franchise, the Denver Summit will play its first game on Saturday, March 28. Billed as \"The Kickoff,\" the club will take the pitch at NFL stadium, Empower Field at Mile High, in Denver. The marquee event is scheduled to be televised on CBS, with the opponent to be announced during the official regular-season schedule announcement. What's nextThe club continues to build its roster ahead of the 2026 NWSL regular season. While Lindsey Heaps' arrival won't impact the team till the second half of the year, there are still plenty of league-experienced players already on part of Denver's inaugural roster. The club signed free agents Ally Watt and Kaleigh Kurtz, and recently acquired Canadian international Janine Sonis. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The WNBA and the Women's National Basketball Players Association have entered a period of \"status quo\" after the 2020 collective bargaining agreement expired on Friday without a new deal or another extension. Though a work stoppage is now a possibility, both sides have signaled a desire to continue negotiations. \"The current Collective Bargaining Agreement has expired, and negotiations with the Women's National Basketball Players Association remain ongoing,\" the league said in a statement on Friday. \"As the league experiences a pivotal time of unprecedented popularity and growth, we recognize the importance of building upon that momentum. Our priority is a deal that significantly increases player salaries, enhances the overall player experience, and supports the long-term growth of the league for current and future generations of players and fans.\"   \n        \n            \n                Breanna Stewart says WNBA, WNBPA won't reach a CBA deal by Friday deadline, will enter 'status quo' period\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhile there is still plenty of time for the two sides to get a new deal done without delaying the 2026 season, the offseason has already been interrupted. The Toronto Tempo and Portland Fire, the two expansion teams set to join the league in 2026, have not been able to hold their expansion draft yet, and will be unable to do so until a new CBA is in place. Additionally, what will be the busiest and most important free agency period in league history should be getting underway right now. But with no CBA in place, there is plenty of uncertainty on all sides. As CBA negotiations continue, here's a look at what's happening with free agency. \nWhen would free agency typically take place?Free agency typically begins in mid-January, and most of the big moves are usually wrapped up by mid-February. Here's a look at last year's key dates:Jan. 11-20: Teams are allowed to make qualifying offers and \"Core player\" designationsJan. 21-31: Teams are allowed to negotiate with free agentsFeb. 1: Players are allowed to sign contracts and offer sheetsTeams that are caught skirting those rules will be punished under the league's tampering policies. Most recently, the Seattle Storm were fined in 2022 for announcing they had re-signed Sue Bird prior to the official start of free agency. Why is this year's free agency period so important?When the 2020 CBA was ratified, it included an opt-out clause for both sides after the 2024 season. Players and their agents have known that an opt-out was a real possibility for a number of years, and have moved strategically in free agency to ensure they were prepared if it happened. \nNow, every single veteran (a player not on a rookie-scale contract) aside from Kalani Brown and Lexie Brown is a free agent this winter. All of these players will be able to sign new deals under the new CBA, which will bring with it significant pay raises. We won't know the 2026 numbers until a new CBA is in place, but the league's latest proposal shows exactly why so many players wanted to be free agents this winter. The minimum salary would more than triple, the average salary would more than quadruple and the max would more than quintuple, a source close to the situation told CBS Sports. Here's a look at the differences between 2025 and 2026 under the league's prosposal:\nSeasonSalary capMinimum salaryAverage salaryMax salary2025$1.5 million$66,079$120,000$249,244 2026$5 million~$230,000~$530,000$1.3 millionNever have so many stars hit unrestricted free agency at the same time. For reference, eight of the 10 players who received All-WNBA honors last season are free agents, including the entire First Team. If you look at the All-Star rosters, 19 of the 25 players in Indianapolis last summer are free agents. Add in dozens of role players, the arrival of two new teams, and the fact that so many players are currently in Miami with Unrivaled, and rosters could look significantly different from last season. \"It's really not recruiting,\" Kahleah Copper said, via Front Office Sports, when asked if players have been talking with each other about free agency. \"Yesterday after practice we just sat in the locker room and talked general free agency, where we thought people would go, what teams we thought would break up, what people are chasing, what are you looking for. … We all kind of play GM with each other.\" What happens without a CBA in place?If a work stoppage occurs, all league business would cease, including free agency. Again, though, neither side appears eager to take that step -- at least right now. It is worth noting, however, that the WNBPA voted in December to authorize a strike \"if necessary.\" During a status quo period, the working conditions of the previous CBA remain in place. Thus, as long as status quo continues, free agency can technically proceed. According to ESPN, the league informed teams last week that they should prepare to continue business as usual and send out qualifying offers and core designations under the conditions of the expired CBA. Of course, it makes no sense for players to sign any offers when they're on the verge of a major pay raise. WNBPA vice president Breanna Stewart told reporters in Miami during Unrivaled last week that there is an \"understanding\" among the players not to sign anything right now. \nThere's no point in going through the motions of free agency if no player is going to sign anything, which is why both sides are in the process of negotiating a moratorium, per ESPN. What is a moratorium?A moratorium would pause league business, including free agency, and save everyone the hassle of dealing with pointless paperwork and negotiations during the height of the most important CBA negotiations in league history. Per ESPN, the league put a moratorium proposal in writing on Friday, and the WNBPA is still reviewing the proposal. Free agency would then resume whenever a new CBA is ratified, with a timeline to be determined. When could a new CBA be in place?While there's still time to get a new deal done to ensure the 2026 season starts in mid-May as usual, there is not unlimited time. It's still unclear exactly when a new CBA will be in place, but Stewart told Sarah Spain on her podcast last week that both sides want to have things wrapped up by the end of the month. \n\"Hopefully, everything can be done by February 1,\" Stewart said. \"Even if we agree, we still have to wait for the contracts to be written. So there's a lot to be thinking about. It's not just like, oh, you're done now, it'll work. If we can get by February 1, we'll all be in a good place.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 PGA Tour schedule gets underway at the 2026 Sony Open in Hawaii on Thursday, Jan. 15. The season opener at Waialae Country Club in Honolulu comes a week later than normal after The Sentry was cancelled this year due to course concerns. That means there will be just one event on the Hawaii Swing this year, and some top players decided not to make the trip. Big names like Collin Morikawa, Hideki Matsuyama, J.J. Spaun and Jordan Spieth, however, are among the golfers who are teeing it up this week.The latest 2026 Sony Open odds from DraftKings Sportsbook lists Morikawa, Matsuyma and Spaun all at +2000, with Spieth at +3500. The favorites are Russell Henley at +1200 and Ben Griffin at +1400. Before locking in any 2026 Sony Open picks, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up over $8,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.This same model has also nailed a whopping 16 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- as well as this year's PGA Championship and Open Championship. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting sites. \nNew users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Now that the 2026 Sony Open field is locked in, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard. 2026 Sony Open predictions One major surprise the model is calling for at the 2026 Sony Open: Russell Henley, the betting favorite, stumbles and barely finishes inside the top 5. He's a golfer to avoid this week. The 2013 Sony Open champion hasn't been able to follow up on that success at this event with regularity. Since that time, he's missed the cut twice and has three other finishes outside the top 30. Last year, he finished T10. He's played just once since last year's playoffs and finished 19th at the Procore Championship, so the model doesn't love his value as a favorite this year. See who else to fade here. \nAnother surprise: J.J. Spaun, a +2000 longshot, makes a strong run at the title. He's a target for anyone looking for a huge payday. The 2025 U.S. Open winner finished T3 in this event last year. He also brings some momentum into the new year after playing three times in the fall and finishing no worse than T11 in those tournaments. The model has identified him as a top-three contender this week, making him a golfer to back in your Sony Open best bets. See who else to pick here. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:How to make 2026 Sony Open picksThe model also has identified three golfers with odds of +2500 or higher as top-10 contenders.

    "body": "\n        Despite reports involving Matt LaFleur's hot seat and uncertain future following Green Bay's 31-27 wild-card loss to the Chicago Bears in the NFL playoffs, the Packers are expected \"to try to work out a deal in the coming days,\" ESPN reports.LaFleur is 76-40-1 in Green Bay with six postseason appearances in seven years -- with a 3-6 overall record in the playoffs. \"Next season is the last on LaFleur's contract, and new Packers CEO Ed Policy has said he doesn't wish for someone to coach in a lame duck year. So the Packers will seemingly either extend LaFleur or part ways with him, via a firing or a trade. In theory, time is ticking on Green Bay's decision,\" CBS Sports insider Jonathan Jones wrote over Wild Card Weekend.LaFleur said after Saturday night's loss in Chicago that he wanted to remain with the Packers. Green Bay lost an 18-point lead in the second half despite four touchdown passes from franchise quarterback Jordan Love.\"Of course [I want to return]. This is one of one,\" LaFleur said. \"I love this place. I love the people. As much as you guys drive me nuts sometimes, I love you guys. I love our players, the locker room, everybody in our organization. I mean, this is a unique place. The community has been outstanding. I grew up in the Midwest and it's got the same type of vibe that I grew up [with] in Mt. Pleasant, Michigan. \n\"So, people are just -- unless you're from here, you don't understand, I think, how friendly everybody is. And it's nice no matter who you are, you're walking down the street, and people say hello to one another. I've lived other places, so I think this is a unique place, this is a special place. My kids love it here, my family loves it here.\"Love gave LaFleur his seal of approval after the Packers' ill-fated fourth quarter against the Bears, who scored 25 points in the final frame to win.\"Yeah, I definitely think Matt should be the head coach. I've got a lot of love for Matt. I think he does a great job. And that's it,\" Love said.\nGreen Bay lost five straight to end the regular season and limped into the playoffs from the NFC North. The belief was LaFleur, who's entering the final year of his contract in 2026, would meet with Policy sometime this week to discuss his future. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The legal team for Ole Miss quarterback Trinidad Chambliss is expecting to file suit in Mississippi state court for a preliminary injunction to secure eligibility for 2026, according to ESPN. Attorney Tom Mars is working with Mississippi trial lawyer William Liston to assist in the move for Chambliss, who seeks relief for his 2022 season at Division II Ferris State.The NCAA denied his waiver request last week, likely ending a college career that culminated with consecutive College Football Playoff wins prior to a semifinal loss to Miami. Chambliss had a deal in place at Ole Miss to return in 2026 under first-year coach Pete Golding under the condition that the NCAA granted his waiver request.\"The last time I checked, however, the only score that matters is the one at the end of the fourth quarter,\" Mars said regarding the NCAA's decision. \"I understand that Ole Miss will file an appeal with the NCAA. However, there's now an opportunity to move this case to a level playing field where Trinidad's rights will be determined by the Mississippi judiciary instead of some bureaucrats in Indianapolis who couldn't care less about the law or doing the right thing. \"Whether to pursue that course of action is a decision only Trinidad and his parents can make.\"\nChambliss argues the legitimacy of his case because of \"incapacitating injury or illness\" in 2022. The NCAA argued that proper documentation from that time period wasn't provided and Ferris State's reasoning for Chambliss not playing after redshirting the previous season was \"development needs and our team's competitive circumstances.\"The NCAA approved six of nine extension waiver requests this offseason in football and those half-dozen approvals all included proper documentation. Mars said Chambliss provided 91 pages of medical documentation from that season, which cited throat and respiratory issues.\"There's now an opportunity to move this case to a level playing field where Trinidad's rights will determined by the Mississippi judiciary instead of some bureaucrats in Indianapolis who couldn't care less about the law or doing the right thing,\" Mars said in a statement.\nRebels' have backup plan at QBOle Miss signed Auburn transfer quarterback Deuce Knight, and he projects to start if Chambliss remains ineligible. Knight redshirted on the Plains as a freshman after only appearing in two games. However, his time in spot duty enhanced his value as a potential transfer, which included a record-tying six touchdown performance in his only start (Mercer).Knight finished with 239 yards passing and 162 yards on the ground to highlight his appearance before transitioning into a four-star portal entry after the season. Knight's four rushing touchdowns in the game that came before the Iron Bowl were the most by an Auburn quarterback in his starting debut in 50 years.A native of Lucedale, Miss., Knight was a four-star prospect in the 2025 recruiting cycle who signed with Auburn as the gem of the class under Hugh Freeze. Knight ranked as the 56th-best player nationally in his class and No. 6 overall quarterback, according to 247Sports.\nThe Rebels' quarterback room was barren after Chambliss' situation turned bleak, especially after Ole Miss backup quarterback Austin Simmons transferred to Missouri. Knight is a dual-threat player, like Chambliss, and will work closely with new offensive coordinator John David Baker if Chambliss does not win his appeal. Baker is back in Oxford after spending the last two seasons as East Carolina's play-caller, and replaces Charlie Weis Jr. following his exit to LSU.\n            ",

While the report states Simpson staying in the NFL Draft is \"not a done deal,\" 247Sports reports that Simpson is \"not wavering\" on his decision. Simpson's offers include three from SEC schools \"north of $4 million\" and one program reportedly offering a $6.5 million package, sources told AL.com.Wednesday represents the deadline for underclassmen to enter the NFL Draft. Simpson's father, UT-Martin head coach Jason Simpson, told ESPN his son has received first-round grades from every NFL general manager spoken to since the season ended. He also confirmed to ESPN that several programs expressed transfer interest, including Miami, Oregon and Tennessee.\"There were very, very lucrative opportunities to play another year of college football,\" Jason Simpson said.CBS Sports previously reported that Miami and LSU were two of the programs left on the board expected to sign a top-end quarterback, options that include former Arizona State star Sam Leavitt. Multiple sources close to Miami told CBS Sports over the weekend that the Alabama quarterback could enter the picture for the Hurricanes.\nIn CBS Sports' latest mock draft first round from Mike Renner, Simpson is slotted to go 29th overall to the Los Angeles Rams as a possible heir to veteran Matthew Stafford. Simpson is the No. 3 quarterback behind Indiana's Fernando Mendoza and Oregon's Dante Moore.Simpson completed 64.5% of his passes for 3,567 yards with 28 touchdowns and five interceptions during the 2025 season, his first as a starter after sitting the last two years in Tuscaloosa behind Jalen Milroe.\n\"Yes, they would love for him to come back,\" Jason Simpson said of Alabama's coaching staff. \"But if you've got an opportunity to go be a first-round pick in the NFL draft, you go. That's why they pour all that into you, for that individual opportunity, so I really appreciated them.\"\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        In an era where college football quarterbacks rarely have the patience to sit for more than a year or two before jumping in the transfer portal, a story in Eugene, Oregon may be brewing that would completely buck that trend. What if Dylan Raiola, a two-year starter at Nebraska, transferred to Oregon just to sit for a year behind Dante Moore?It sounds ridiculous, but that's a reality that's emerging as a possibility, according to sources. Moore is projected as a first-round pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. Raiola, the No. 5 quarterback in the 247Sports transfer portal rankings, committed to Oregon on Monday morning. And they really could play together next season depending on how the next couple days play out. \nMoore's decisionMoore is currently projected to go No. 2 overall in CBS Sports' latest 2026 mock draft. Despite the hype that surrounded the 2026 quarterback class entering the season, many of those top contenders -- Cade Klubnik, Garrett Nussmeier, Drew Allar -- have fallen out of first-round consideration. Fernando Mendoza leapt up draft boards to likely take the No. 1 spot. The class behind him, beyond Moore, is barren. Ty Simpson is the only other passer who's really garnered any sort of first-round hype to this point. \nDespite that status as a likely first-round pick, it's not a lock that Moore declares for the draft.It's still very possible. Yet just three days ahead of the Jan. 14 NFL Draft declaration deadline for underclassmen, sources do not consider it a guarantee Moore leaves for the NFL. Those around college football believe Moore should go given his status near the top of the draft class. Yet some sources CBS Sports have spoken to in recent days consider it closer to a 50-50 tossup. Remember, Moore could still make millions at Oregon in 2026 and stay in college. It's not as if he'd turn down life-changing money to stay.  Those percentages have gone up and down as the season went along. Midway through the year those around Moore felt it was a lock he'd return for the 2026 season. That shifted late in the year following Moore's strong play and offensive coordinator Will Stein's departure for Kentucky. \nNow, with just a few days to go until the deadline, Moore's decision could swing the 2026 NFL Draft. He's either a quality QB2 for quarterback-needy NFL teams or there's a severe drop-off after Mendoza as teams seek to solve their annual quarterback issues. \n        \n            \n                What's next for Oregon? Major changes ahead as Dan Lanning replaces two coordinators and maybe QB Dante Moore\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nRaiola's process Other teams have looked at Raiola this cycle, including Louisville, but there's been a single team Raiola's camp focused on -- Oregon.\nThat's the school the family had strong interest in, and they've made that known consistently to the Ducks brass. Thus, it should come as no surprise that once Oregon's season ended in the semifinals, Raiola ended up on campus the next day for a visit. Oregon's recruited other quarterbacks this portal cycle, including now-Oklahoma State QB Drew Mestemaker. Yet Raiola appeared to be the first transfer quarterback that made it to campus this cycle. The interesting wrinkle with Raiola is his camp communicated to Oregon, per sources, he'd be willing to sit behind Moore for a year if Moore were back in Eugene for the 2026 season. \nRaiola is yet to redshirt. He could do so in 2026 and still play two more seasons in 2027 and 2028. Raiola and his camp view Oregon as his best chance to compete for championships and develop, which makes sense given the Ducks' last three QBs (Bo Nix, Dillon Gabriel, Moore) have leapt up draft boards upon transferring to Eugene. It's a strategy Moore employed two years ago. He started as a five-star true freshman for UCLA in 2023, transferred to Oregon that offseason and sat behind Gabriel for a season. Now, he's being talked about as a potential second overall pick. Raiola and his camp see a similar path as possible even though they'd prefer to just be Oregon's QB1 in 2026. \nOregon's 2026 contender statusDespite a 34-point loss in the Peach Bowl to Indiana, the Ducks again look like a title contender in 2026. Dan Lanning has signed three straight top-five high school classes, is once again pursuing high-level talent in the portal and projects to return double-digit starters pending NFL Draft decisions. Oregon will begin the year in the preseason top 10. How high it climbs likely depends on whether the Ducks are led by Moore or someone else is the big question. \nIf the Ducks manage to keep Moore and land Raiola, they'd have the unquestioned top quarterback room in the country. Were Oregon to end up with Raiola as its QB1, he'd be a worthy but still reasonably unproven successor to the Ducks' recent run of quarterbacks. Either way, even as LSU, Miami and Tennessee attempt to fill their quarterback spots, the Ducks have by far the most interesting signal caller quandary ahead of them. Two five-stars with multiple years of starting experience in one room together? It's possible. \n            ",

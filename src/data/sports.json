    "body": "\n        Gabriel Bonfim and Randy Brown took very different paths to their first UFC Fight Night main event. Bonfim is a relatively new addition to the UFC roster; meanwhile, Brown celebrates a decade with the promotion in January. They collide on Saturday night at the UFC Apex in Las Vegas.Bonfim (18-1) is defending his ranking, but arguably has more to prove than his opponent. Bonfim became a top 15 welterweight off a controversial decision win over longtime contender Stephen \"Wonderboy\" Thompson. Two years ago, nearly to the day, he was knocked out by Nicolas Dalby. A close decision win over Brown, an unranked fighter approaching 10 years with the promotion, won't do him much good. Bonfim needs a standout performance.\"If I let Brown control the distance and keep the fight standing, he has an advantage, that's his game. But not with me,\" Bonfim told CBS Sports through a Portuguese interpreter. \" I'm very comfortable exchanging punches. I know he's afraid and weary of my ground game.\"\n        \n            \n                Jon Jones rips Tom Aspinall's skills after UFC 321: 'His wrestling and jiu-jitsu are incredibly overrated'\n                \n                    Shakiel Mahjouri                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBrown (20-6) is determined to make the most of his first main event. He's a promising contender, but every time he builds steam, his momentum gets cut short by guys like Belal Muhammad, Jack Della Maddalena and Vicente Luque. But all that experience has given him a level head. Brown is coming off a KO win over Dalby, the only person to beat Bonfim, but he isn't putting much stock in it. Brown knows exactly what Bonfim did wrong, but he can't guarantee he'll make those mistakes again. \n\"I know exactly what he lost that fight and what happened. I can't assume he's in that same place. He was pushed, overwhelmed, got tired, and was stopped...\" Brown told CBS Sports. \"I can't bank on him making those same mistakes. For all I know, he's in the best shape of his life, and when he shows up he'll be ready to do 10 rounds.\" There isn't a lot to write home about on the undercard. Ricky Simon vs. Raoni Barcelos is solid matchmaking. Neither fighter is currently ranked, but they're veteran fighters who've mixed it up with the best. Simon notably holds a controversial win over reigning UFC bantamweight champion Merab Dvalishvili and has fought former WEC champ Urijah Faber. Barcelos mixed it up with title challenger Umar Nurmagomedov in recent years.Rising flyweights are set for the co-main event when Joseph Morales takes on Matt Schnell. Morales is fresh off winning The Ultimate Fighter 33 in August with a submission of Alibi Idiris in August. He had a previous run with UFC in 2017 and 2018 before three years of inactivity. He posted a 1-2 record in that time, including a TKO loss to former champion Deiveson Figueiredo. Schnell, meanwhile, has been a fixture since 2016 where he's posted a 7-7, 1 NC record. He ended a three-fight losing skid in April with a decision win over Jimmy Flick.\nBelow is the rest of the fight card for Saturday, with the latest odds before we get to a prediction and pick on the main event. UFC Fight Night card, oddsOdds via DraftKings SportsbookFavorite Underdog Weight classGabriel Bonfim -190Randy Brown +160Welterweight  Joseph Morales -420  Matt Schnell +330  FlyweightUros Medic -150  Muslim Salikhov +125  WelterweightIsmael Bonfim -195Chris Padilla +165  LightweightRicky Simon -180Raoni Barcelos +150BantamweightMarco Tulio -185  Christian Leroy Duncan +155  Middleweight UFC Fight Night viewing information Date: Nov. 8 | Start time: 7 p.m. ET (main card) Location: UFC Apex -- Las Vegas TV channel: ESPN+ Prediction Gabriel Bonfim vs. Randy Brown: Don't let Bonfim's ranking fool you; he has something to prove. Many believe \"Wonderboy\" beat Bonfim. Dalby knocked him out. They were Bonfim's two most experienced opponents. Brown is another such veteran, having faced world-class competition for over a decade. He's fully capable of exploiting whatever holes Bonfim gives him, especially should he wilt over five rounds. Skill-wise, I lean towards Bonfim. He has fantastic submissions, judicious wrestling, and responsible striking defense. Thompson outstruck Bonfim in totality, but their significant strike outputs were almost identical. \nLast year, Elizeu Zaleski dos Santos took down Brown four times. The year before that, Della Maddalena submitted Brown -- one of only two submission wins in the champ's 20-fight pro career. There are conditions we should acknowledge in those two fights: Brown still beat Dos Santos, and Della Maddalena locked in the rear-naked choke off a knockdown. The fight benefits Brown the longer it goes. Ultimately, Bonfim shines more where Brown struggles. The inverse isn't quite as true. I'll take Bonfim, hesitantly, by submission. Bonfim via SUB2\n            ",

These were the top two defensive teams in the NBA last season, though, with the Magic as the No. 1 scoring defense, allowing 105.5 ppg. The Magic are 15th in the league at 117.6 ppg this season, but that defensive focus remains in Orlando. The Magic are 20th in scoring offense with Boston 24th, as this has all the ingredients of an Under total. The model projects the Under to hit in 68% of simulations. Back the Under at FanDuel Sportsbook:Northwestern (+13.5) vs. USC (+100)\"The Trojans can thank their lucky stars that Nebraska QB Dylan Raiola got injured in the second half last week at Lincoln with the Huskers up 14-6 and driving inside of USC territory,\" SportsLine legendary expert Bruce Marshall said. \"Nebraska's offense would then effectively stop as frosh QB TJ Lateef couldn't throw the ball downfield, netting just 7 pass yards the rest of the night, while USC rallied to a 21-17 win. Northwestern hasn't played USC at the Coliseum since 1969, but it's a better Northwestern team, and better than last year too, more resembling David Braun's 2023 overachievers, only this time with a real QB in the fold (SMU transfer Preston Stone) while a gnarly defense has helped NU to five straight covers.\" Back Northwestern at FanDuel Sportsbook:North Carolina (-1.5) vs. Kansas (-118)North Carolina vs. Kansas is one of those dream matchups for college basketball fans, and after the Jayhawks defeated the Tar Heels in Kansas last year in their first regular-season matchup since 2002, now they need to come to Chapel Hill. And the model projects North Carolina to protect its home court, as it has the vast majority of times in recent years. The Tar Heels went 26-4 at home over their previous two seasons, and opened the year with a 40-point victory over Central Arkansas in Chapel Hill. Caleb Wilson, the No. 8 recruit in the Class of 2025 by 247Sports, scored 22 points in his debut as the prized recruit of the No. 5 freshman class in the nation. North Carolina also returns its third-leading scorer in Seth Trimble, who averaged 11.6 ppg last season.

I think they deserve full credit for this award because, in the end, the manager that wins this kind of award is not the best team, but the team that performs maybe better during this month. So I just expect to win the next one because it is a sign we won football matches.\"What are Tottenham saying? Speaking ahead of the home game, Frank took some time to reflect on his first months at the club: \"That will be a work in progress, no doubt about that. I think the first three months have been super exciting, a big learning curve, you learn every single day. You walk into a new club, you learn the players, you learn the staff, you learn about the club, you learn about how it works, the fans, everything. But I think it's been overall, fine. I think we've been doing quite well to be able to get the amount of points we got in the Champions League and in the Premier League, competing in two fronts at the same time.\" Possible lineupsTottenham XI: Guglielmo Vicario; Pedro Porro, Cristian Romero, Micky van de Ven, Djed Spence; Joao Palhinha, Rodrigo Bentancur; Brennan Johnson, Xavi Simons, Wilson Odobert; Randal Kolo Muani.Manchester United XI: Senne Lammens; Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt, Luke Shaw; Amad, Casemiro, Bruno Fernandes, Diogo Dalot; Bryan Mbeumo; Matheus Cunha; Benjamin Sesko.PredictionManchester United come from three wins and one draw in the last four Premier League games played and this is their big chance to prove them again. Pick: Tottenham 1, Manchester United 2. What's on CBS Sports Golazo Network🥅 Scoreline (Daily): Scoreline is the newest place for fans to catch up on all the biggest news and results impacting global football, match highlights from the top soccer competitions and all the can't-miss goals from the day's action, starting Thursday and airing seven days a week.📺 How to watch: CBS Sports Golazo Network is a free 24/7 channel exclusively dedicated to offering unparalleled coverage of all the top soccer competitions worldwide.

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 Serie A season is in full swing in Italy. Napoli started the campaign as defending champions after winning the 2024-25 title, their fourth Scudetto ever on the last matchday of the season. Inter, Juventus and AC Milan will compete with the team coached by Antonio Conte to win the Serie A title, while other teams such as AS Roma, Atalanta, Lazio, Fiorentina, Bologna and Como are all in contention for a spot in next season's European tournaments.This weekend's Serie A slate features some huge battles, highlighted by Lazio visiting Inter on Sunday: Here's what to know:Pulisic finally back in the squadAC Milan manager Massimiliano Allegri has announced USMNT star Christian Pulisic will be called back in the squad ahead of the away game against Parma on Saturday. The American international got injured in the U.S. men's national team's match against Australia on October 14 and since then missed four matches with the Italian club, which also led USMNT manager Mauricio Pochettino to not call him ahead of the upcoming international break as the national team continue their preparation for the 2026 World Cup with a friendly against Paraguay on November 15 and one against Uruguay on November 18.Speaking to the media ahead of the Parma game, Allegri announced Pulisic will be back on Saturday. \"He's done two training sessions with the team, he's physically fine and already in good condition, because he has a physique that doesn't need to work too much. Then I don't know how many minutes he will have.\" The start of the 2025-26 season has been really positive for Pulisic, who already scored six goals and provided two assists in the opening eight games in all competitions. Allegri's tactical decision to move him further up the pitch in a 3-5-2 system, pairing him with the central striker, has proven to be one of the Italian manager's smartest moves, significantly boosting Pulisic's performances. It's likely to see him playing back in that position after the international break regularly. \nHow to watch Inter vs. Lazio, oddsDate: Sunday, Nov. 9 | Time: 2:45 p.m. ETLocation: San Siro -- Milan Live stream: Paramount+Odds: Inter -282; Draw +400; Lazio +675How to watch Serie A Matchday 11All times U.S./EasternFriday, November 7Pisa 1 Cremonese 0Saturday, November 8Como vs. Cagliari, 9 a.m. (Paramount+)Lecce vs. Hellas Verona, 9 a.m. (Paramount+)Juventus vs. Torino, 12 p.m. (Paramount+)Parma vs. AC Milan, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)\nSunday, November 9Atalanta vs. Sassuolo, 6:30 a.m. (Paramount+)Genoa vs. Fiorentina, 9 a.m. (Paramount+)Bologna vs. Napoli, 9 a.m. (Paramount+)AS Roma vs. Udinese, 12 p.m. (Paramount+)Inter vs. Lazio, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)\n            ",

    "body": "\n        LUBBOCK, Texas -- The wait for Texas Tech forward JT Toppin to get back on the court after turning down the NBA in the offseason was longer than anticipated. A few days after a lower body injury kept him out of No. 10 Texas Tech's season-opening win against Lindenwood on Monday, it didn't take Toppin long to show he's ready for the 2025-26 season in Friday's 98-77 win against Sam Houston.Toppin won the opening tip for the Red Raiders and scored his first layup 16 seconds into the game. He quickly blocked a shot, grabbed a rebound and powered through for another layup. Even as Sam Houston ran a few impressive offensive sets to keep the game close for a half, Toppin's gravity wore the Bearkats down. \"I was a little winded, just first game,\" Toppin said. \"But it was exciting to get back out there and share the court with my teammates.\" Hard to stop ToppinIf Toppin's performance was a diminished version, Texas Tech's potential is limitless. Toppin finished with 31 points and 14 rebounds in 32 minutes. He added four assists, three steals and a block. But most dangerous, he was relentless attacking the basket. \nSam Houston threw several bodies at Toppin across the floor, but none were able to contain him. Toppin was fouled 13 times and helped foul out two of Sam Houston's players. He shot 10 of 16 on 2-point attempts, even as he tried to stretch his range out to the 3-point line. Later in the game, he started settling down and whipping passes from the mid-post out to open shooters. His four assists matches his season high from the 2025 season; a 30% assist rate in the game tripled his previous season mark. \"Let's not take it for granted,\" Texas Tech coach Grant McCasland said. \"He's gotten better and will keep getting better… Before his injury, he was bringing up the ball in transition. Passes he was making out of the post tonight, he was making in transition. His ball handling is tight. That's where he's improved the most.\" \nIn their first game with all the pieces available, the Red Raiders were sloppy for stretches on defense. The Bearkats had 18 offensive rebounds and connected on half of their 3-pointers in the first half, which opened up drives to the basket. However, point guard Christian Anderson and Toppin were steadying forces in the second half for the roster. Newcomer Donovan Atwell was also tremendous, hitting six 3-pointers, with several coming off passes from Toppin and Anderson. The duo had 11 combined assists, matching the number Sam Houston produced across the game. Red Raiders thinking bigExpectations have been high for Texas Tech heading into a heralded season. Toppin was projected as a potential first round NBA Draft pick, but turned down the draft after the Red Raiders made a strong financial offer for him to stick around. The program also retained Anderson and landed a stacked portal class. \nThree of Texas Tech's five starters against Sam Houston were newcomers, while Big 12 Newcomer of the Year LeJuan Watts came off the bench. This weekend is also a big one for the athletic department. Texas Tech's football team hosts No. 7 BYU in one of the school's most high-profile matchups ever. Several basketball players came through a pregame campout at \"Raiderville\" to hand out pizzas, sign autographs and take pictures with fans. The 2025-26 school year marks perhaps the most pivotal in Texas Tech history, and a transient basketball roster has felt the pressure. The win was only a first look of what Texas Tech can accomplish, especially as the roster gets healthier. But if Toppin plays like the First Team All-American that he is, the Red Raiders will be tough to stop. A road trip to No. 17 Illinois on Tuesday is an early proving ground. \n\"I don't think we've practiced as a whole enough for us to be at our best yet,\" McCasland said. \"We've got the right pieces. We've just got to keep getting better.\" \n            ",

There is no timetable for his return.According to The Athletic, Dahlin will return to his home country to support his fiancée, Carolina Matovac, who is in recovery from a heart transplant.\"He said everything is OK,\" Ruff said. \"He's got full support by our team.\"Dahlin and Matovac announced in September that the latter experienced major heart failure on vacation in France this summer. She received life-saving CPR for hours at a time and was transferred to a hospital, where she remained on life support for weeks while she awaited a heart transplant. Matovac had the transplant later in the summer and eventually returned to Sweden to continue the rehabilitation process.\n\"I think it's been incredibly hard,\" Ruff said. \"Not easy. I fully understand what this young man is going through. I don't think you can describe it, and I don't think you can feel what he's feeling. I'm pretty passionate about the fact that no one would want to walk in his shoes and have dealt with what he dealt with. He has undoubtedly got the support of everybody on this. This is larger than hockey.\"Dahlin embarked on the NHL season with the Sabres during Matovac's recovery but will step away temporarily after 14 games. Despite the heavy emotional toll of his fiancée's health, Dahlin was highly productive as the anchor of the Sabres' defense and accumulated nine points while averaging more than 24 minutes per contest.\"Family and person come before hockey,\" Ruff said. \"Hockey's our job. Hockey's our lifeline. But family and personal trump anything that comes before.\"\nThe Sabres selected Dahlin with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2018 NHL Draft. They will have to press on for the foreseeable future without their most reliable defenseman -- a three-time NHL All-Star who is in his second year as the team's captain.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Catcher took a big leap in 2025, with Hunter Goodman, Ben Rice, Agustin Ramirez and Drake Baldwin all emerging as impact bats at the position and Kyle Teel making his presence known as well. But that's not the end of it. Samuel Basallo barely got his feet wet at the end of the year. Same for Carter Jensen. They rank as the top two in a catcher class that remains loaded with offensive talent, even with the recent influx we've seen in the majors. 2026 Prospects: C | 1B | 2B | 3B | SS | OF | P    Some of it's still far away, and the assurances run out before we arrive at the 10th name on the list. But that should go without saying at catcher, a position where playing time can be unpredictable and not every prospect goes on to meet the high defensive threshold. I would guess at least three of these catchers don't actually end up as catchers. But the bottom line is that there's still plenty to look forward to at this position even with the embarrassment of riches in the majors. \nNote: These rankings are intended mainly for Dynasty use, emphasizing long-term value over a quick payoff, but to say proximity holds no weight wouldn't be entirely accurate either. Not all of these players will contribute in 2026 — most, in fact, will not — but among prospects, they're the names Fantasy Baseballers most need to know.  1. Samuel Basallo, Orioles  Age (on opening day): 21 Where he played in 2025: Triple-A, majors Minor league stats: .270 BA (270 AB), 23 HR, .966 OPS, 44 BB, 76 K Major league stats: .165 BA (109 AB), 4 HR, .559 OPS, 6 BB, 30 K Though a masher of the highest standing in the minors, Basallo failed to capitalize on a late-season injury to Adley Rutschman, continuing the Orioles' recent trend of high-profile prospect disappointments. The sample was too small to take at face value, though, and the expectation is that he'll enter spring training with the inside track at either first base or DH, making him an early Rookie of the Year favorite. \n 2. Carter Jensen, Royals Age (on opening day): 22 Where he played in 2025: Double-A, Triple-A, majors Minor league stats: .290 BA (427 AB), 20 HR, 10 SB, .878 OPS, 60 BB, 122 K Major league stats: .300 BA (60 AB), 3 HR, .941 OPS, 9 BB, 12 K Jensen had the major league debut Basallo was supposed to, forcing his way into an everyday role with a 95.4 mph average exit velocity and the top-line production to match. It was a clarifying performance for a player who caught some evaluators by surprise -- a seamless continuation of his minor league breakthrough -- and it might lead to Salvador Perez spending most of his time at DH this year.  3. Josue Briceno, Tigers Age (on opening day): 21 Where he played in 2025: High-A, Double-A Minor league stats: .266 BA (364 AB), 20 HR, .883 OPS, 66 BB, 87 K \nBriceno's MVP performance in the Arizona Fall League a year ago indeed carried over to regular season play at High-A, where he slashed .296/.422/.602 in 55 games. His production slipped with a midseason move up to Double-A, but he was still only 20 at the time and sustained his strong plate discipline and exit velocity readings. Rarely these days are catchers as tall as he is, but to use an old trope, the bat will play anywhere.  4. Alfredo Duno, Reds Age (on opening day): 20   Where he played in 2025: Low-A   Minor league stats: .287 BA (390 AB), 18 HR, .948 OPS, 95 BB, 91 K There's a case for ranking Duno ahead of Briceno given that he's already producing major league-caliber exit velocities as a 19-year-old and slashed .316/.456/.632 over his final 40 games, but Briceno was putting up similar numbers a step higher on the minor-league ladder. It's true that Duno is the more likely of the two to stick at catcher, but that's not always the best thing for a player's Fantasy value (because of playing time concerns and whatnot). \n 5. Moises Ballesteros, Cubs Age (on opening day): 22 Where he played in 2025: Triple-A, majors   Minor league stats: .316 BA (446 AB), 13 HR, 29 2B, .858 OPS, 49 BB, 67 K Major league stats: .298 BA (57 AB), 2 HR, 2 2B, .868 OPS, 9 BB, 12 K The first thing you'll notice about Ballesteros is that he's built like a bowling ball, but what matters more is his uncanny knack for making good contact on bad pitches, which points to high batting average potential. He's often compared to Alejandro Kirk because of his shape, position and contact skills, but I think a Pablo Sandoval comp more accurately captures his upside as a hitter, not to mention his likelihood of moving off catcher. Note: Ballesteros is eligible only at DH to begin 2026 since that's where he spent most of his time with the big club in 2025. Because I won't be ranking DH prospects, though, I thought it only fitting for me to rank him at his natural position, even if the odds are against him sticking there. \n 6. Rainiel Rodriguez, Cardinals Age (on opening day): 19 Where he played in 2025: Rookie, Low-A, High-A Minor league stats: .276 BA (301 AB), 20 HR, .954 OPS, 54 BB, 65 K Given  what he's already accomplished at age 18 -- climbing all the way to  High-A with strike-zone judgment beyond his years, a swing that's  optimized for power, and exit velocities as high as 111 mph -- it's not  hard to imagine Rodriguez claiming the top spot on this list as early as  next year. Like Ballesteros, he may have trouble finding a defensive  home if he doesn't stick as a catcher, which is a legitimate question  with Ivan Herrera, Leonardo Bernal and Jimmy Crooks also up and coming for the Cardinals.  7. Harry Ford, Mariners Age (on opening day): 23   Where he played in 2025: Triple-A, majors   Minor league stats: .283 BA (374 AB), 16 HR, 7 SB, .868 OPS, 74 BB, 88 K \nFord reversed the trend of declining power with his move up to Triple-A, positioning himself as a top catcher prospect again, but the tradeoff is that he gave up on being a base-stealer, dropping from 35 in 2024 to seven in 2025. Still, the overall profile appears to be more viable now, particularly when you factor in his career .405 on-base percentage in the minors, but there is the not-so-small problem of him playing in the same organization as Cal Raleigh.  8. Eduardo Tait, Twins Age (on opening day): 19 Where he played in 2025: Low-A, High-A Minor league stats: .253 BA (438 AB), 14 HR, 32 2B, .738 OPS, 36 BB, 99 K The stat line may not blow you away, but there's plenty of upside to project onto Tait, who shows considerable power potential with his exit velocities peaking near 114 mph as a teenager. He has yet to fully actualize that power and has strides to make with regard to pitch selection in defense, but the prize of the Jhoan Duran deal is well ahead of the developmental curve, having reached High-A prior to turning 19. \n 9. Ethan Salas, Padres Age (on opening day): 19 Where he played in 2025: Double-A Minor league stats: 6 for 32 (.188), 1 2B, 2 SB, 6 BB, 5 K It feels obligatory to rank Salas here given the mountains of praise heaped upon him as a 17-year-old, but the honest truth is that he hasn't hit a lick in the two years since. Granted, he didn't get a fair shot in 2025, missing most of the year with a stress reaction in his back, and he remains young for his level even if no longer outrageously so. Factor in his Gold Glove-caliber defense, and he's not yet a lost cause.  10. Cooper Ingle, GuardiansAge (on opening day): 24   Where he played in 2025: Double-A, Triple-A   Minor-league stats: .260 BA (510 AB), 10 HR, 36 2B, .808 OPS, 86 BB, 85 K \nThere isn't a clear choice for the No. 10 spot, so while I have some affection for Leonardo Bernal, Jeferson Quero and Marco Dinges, I'll opt for the catcher with the clearest path to playing time, which is Ingle. A Jonathan Lucroy type who consistently walks more than he strikes out and hits doubles like they're going out of style, Ingle may be ready to push Bo Naylor, who has yet to find his footing in the majors after several years of trying.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Well, No. 25 North Carolina has a Quad 1 win in its holster now after the Tar Heels rallied from a double-digit deficit to run away from No. 19 Kansas 87-74 in a Friday barnburner.We'll dive into some takeaways, but first — take a bow, Caleb Wilson.North Carolina has something special brewing with Wilson, a five-star freshman. The 6-10 forward left his imprint all over this one. He dove on the floor to corral loose balls. He ripped down boards. He diced Kansas' defense as a playmaker and a play-finisher. Wilson jack-hammered three dunks and splashed more than a couple face-up jumpers on his way to a 24-point, seven-rebound, four-assist, four-steal night.He was utterly tremendous.Wilson played like a potential top-five pick in exhibition play and also in the Tar Heels' 94-54 season-opening win vs. Central Arkansas on Monday, but consider Friday his introduction to college basketball at large.\nNorth Carolina has a flat-out dude, who plays with the tenacity and passion of a role player who would do simply anything to stay on the floor. He has quickly become an emotional leader for the Tar Heels, who makes defense cool and has changed the complexion of this roster with his unselfishness.\tWhen your best player is your best passer and your highest-energy workhorse, he's a beacon of light for others to follow. Buckets won't come as easily every night as they did Friday, but the burgeoning skill to go along with the hyperactive defense and energy is extremely appealing for both Wilson's long-term stock and North Carolina's short-term quest to be an ACC contender.\nUNC will go as Kyan Evans goesKansas went on a 15-6 run late in the first half to seize control, and that conveniently was synced up with Evans looking all out of sorts. UNC's much-discussed portal addition was passing up open 3-pointers, giving up straight-line drives and couldn't get the basketball out of his hands faster.That flipped in the second half, and predictably, UNC followed suit. Evans delivered 12 points, three dimes and two net-shredding triples in the second half. After wobbling a little after some fullcourt pressure from Melvin Council Jr. in the first half, Evans responded with a zero-turnover second half.UNC turned it over just once in the second half and fried Kansas' defense to the tune of 1.71 points per possession.\nWilson, Seth Trimble and Henri Veesaar (more on them in a minute) were the stars, but Evans is the key to all of it.Darryn Peterson needs help from Jayhawks Wonder how Peterson felt after that bloodbath? The Kansas freshman played 28 minutes with Trimble draped inside his jersey for 26 of 'em. The UNC senior tried to give the five-star freshman a rude \"welcome to college basketball\" moment, and Peterson seemingly rarely flinched. He still hit tough contested midranges. He tickled the twine for three 3-pointers. Even with UNC expanding the lead out to 16 midway through the second half, there was still an inkling of fear because that dude was still balling. \nTrimble played torrid defense, and Peterson still finished with 22 points on efficient 8-for-14 shooting. I have a feeling a lot of defenders will feel like that after trying to handle Peterson.He is All-American good, but Kansas has to figure out some secondary answers to the test.\nWhen Peterson exited the first half with two fouls, Kansas' offense eroded for a stretch. Tre White tried (and failed) to operate as the takeover guy. Kansas simply has to get more from its guards if it wants to be a real-deal contender. Melvin Council gave KU a boost with his point-of-attack defense, playmaking and jet-quick drives, but there are offensive limitations. North Carolina went under every single one of his ball screens, and he couldn't make 'em pay (0-for-4 from downtown).Kansas is a good team, and Friday's result doesn't change that. But if KU doesn't become a true National Championship contender, you can harken back to losing out in the final hour in the Darrion Williams Sweepstakes.This UNC recipe is not fakeEarly-season games need to be taken with a grain of salt sometimes. This was not one of those games. This blueprint for winning basketball games feels extremely duplicatable for UNC moving forward. The Tar Heels were all over the offensive glass, lassoing in 16 offensive rebounds and turning it into six second-chance points. UNC's 44% offensive rebound rate was a higher mark than any game last year when North Carolina just didn't play North Carolina basketball.\nOh, and this frontcourt is the goods. Wilson and Veesaar were the two highest-paid additions this offseason, and they are worth every penny. Veesaar needs to get a few more rebounds (he only had four), but his four assists were enormous. So were the two top-of-the-key treys he hit to start loosening up Kansas' defense. The Veesaar-Wilson marriage looks extremely promising for the future, thanks to the combination of size, speed, athleticism, skill and passing. Their big-to-big passing gave Kansas serious fits and is eerily similar to the Alex Condon-Tommy Haugh, 1-2 punch that gave Florida a different gear. Defensively, that combination is working, too. Trimble was able to be so aggressive at the point of attack because of Wilson and Veesaar on the back end. Kansas shot just one layup and one dunk in the final 16 minutes of regulation. Veesaar and Wilson combined for just one block, but the rim deterrence was noticeable down the stretch.If the offensive rebounding is a staple for UNC moving forward, you can see the vision where this group competes with Duke and Louisville for the ACC crown because the other strengths of this club aren't going anywhere. All nine Tar Heels who played were threats to knock down a triple. Trimble, Wilson and Veesaar present three real-deal defenders at all three levels of the floor. \nA top-five pick, armed with offensive rebounders, defenders and shooters is a real-deal combination. But finding consistent guard play will be essential for UNC to elevate into that elite tier.\n    \n                                        \n    TarHeel247.com is the largest site that covers North Carolina athletics.

    "body": "\n        On Saturday two teams who can be extremely happy with their lot meet as Sunderland welcome Arsenal to the Stadium of Light. With 10 games played both find themselves in positions they could scarcely have dreamed of before a ball had been kicked. A win in this match could set them up perfectly for the business end of the season in the months ahead.For Arsenal it is not so much the table position that is cause for optimism -- their title credentials were long since established -- but the state of the field behind them. Battered and bruised by injuries to their front line, Mikel Arteta's side still find themselves six points ahead of second place. Win on Saturday and they will increase their lead on at least one of their title rivals with Manchester City hosting Liverpool the next day.There is no such need for detailed explanation as to why Sunderland's start has been so brilliant. They're fourth. For most newly promoted sides being 14th would be a triumph at this stage of the season, all the more so if, like Regis Le Bris', they looked a bit ahead of schedule in their escape from the Championship. Sunderland had recruited shrewdly after their promotion, building out experience in the back half of the pitch, but most, this column included, suspected that that business would merely ensure they went down swinging.Now? Well they're going to need to take a Michael Spinks style beatdown just to hit the canvas. Even that might not be enough. Let's see what it would take over the next 28 games for Sunderland to get relegated and, why not, for Arsenal to hold on to top spot.\nViewing informationDate: Saturday, Nov. 8 | Time: 10 a.m. ETLocation: Stadium of Light -- Sunderland, United KingdomLive stream: Paramount+Odds: Slavia Prague +1000; Draw +400; Arsenal -400Arsenal just need to maintain the paceThrough 10 Premier League games this season Arsenal have accrued 25 points, enough to hand them a sizeable advantage over the chasing pack. Now I've grabbed my Casio (other brands are available) and after detailed research can confirm that the league leaders are currently tracking at two and a half points per game. Run that out across the course of the season and Arsenal would end up with 95 points, a mark that has only been reached on five occasions in Premier League history. Four of those came between 2017 and 2020, when Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola were knocking lumps out of each other in routinely thrilling title races.Since then the tally required for a Premier League champion has dropped a notable amount. Last season Liverpool won the title with just 84 points; only twice this century has a lesser return won the league, Manchester United in 2002-03 (83) and Leicester City in the gas leak year that was 2015-16. Arsenal would feel they have a good chance of winning the title if they can hit the average for first place over the last five years. That, rounding to the nearest whole number, is 89. That got them second place in 2023-24 and would be one short of the club record set by the Invincibles.Of course Arteta will be the first to insist this is a marathon not a sprint. Asked on Friday if it was only Arsenal who could stop Arsenal winning the league he was unequivocal. \"Any team has the capacity and I'm sure the belief as well that they can do it. We are fully aware of that. We know our strength, we know the things that we have to improve as well and we just focus on that.\"\nHe would, however, surely have to admit that Arsenal have burst out of the traps with impressive speed. Keep it up and there might be no catching them.Suppose that Arsenal keep motoring at their current 95 point pace. Catching them would require something miraculous for Manchester City and to a minutely greater extent Liverpool. Mission 95 from here on out would require a 2.71 points per game pace from City, over a full season that's 103 points. In other words take the most successful point generating machine in England's footballing history -- Guardiola's centurions of 2017-18 -- and find another win somewhere. To get 76 points from 28 games City could get away with two losses, if they won 25 of the other games. Win just 24 and they need to go undefeated. For Liverpool? That'll be 25 wins, two draws and one loss, to say nothing for the goal difference disadvantage they'd have to overcome.\nLet's give the chasing pack the benefit of the doubt then. Let's suppose Arsenal drop back to being an average title winner in the 2020s and hit 89 points. It doesn't take much of a drop off in performances for that to happen, it's totally foreseeable that injuries to Gabriel Magalhaes, Bukayo Saka and/or a few others might make this an 87 points per season team. What then? Well City and Liverpool would both, just about, have to accrue points for the remainder of the season like Arsenal are now at that 2.5 point per game rate.And here's the kicker. Neither of these two teams look like they're about to start performing as well as the league leaders are. Both City and Liverpool are a long way behind the Gunners' league best non-penalty expected goal difference (npxGD) of 10.22, which on a per game basis is right up there with the teams that won the title in 2020-21 and 2024-25. Those two teams, by the way, ended up on 86 and 84 points, for the chasing pack to hit that they'd need to hit 90 point pace from here on out.At the 10 game mark, xG is more predictive of future results than points and right now neither of the teams in second (City at 8.78) and third (Liverpool at 4.86) compare favorably to the league leaders. All that is required for Arsenal, then, is that they maintain their current standards. Beat Sunderland and what is demanded of the chasing pack becomes that scintilla more difficult.\nSunderland might not be able to tank thisWhen the points tallies are this high, though, there is a lot more margin for error. If Arsenal lost their next two they'd go from a 95 point pace to sub-80. They might not even top the table on gameweek 12. A lot can go wrong in a short space of time in the title race.Not for Sunderland. Where they're concerned a lot needs to go wrong in a particularly long run of time before they risk this season being a disappointment. Before a ball had been kicked Le Bris spoke of a team who would \"struggle for sure,\" but those difficult moments are yet to come, five wins and three draws from their first 10 league games good enough for fourth place. Theirs has been a triumph of defense and organization, their eight goals conceded a record bettered only by Arsenal. It is not entirely unsustainable either, since the start of 2020-21 only 21 teams have allowed fewer npxG per game than Sunderland's 1.06.No wonder owner Kyril Louis-Dreyfus is talking about approaching the January transfer window \"with a top 10 position in mind.\" Ask a Sunderland fan in late July for their points target come the start of the season and a fair few would probably have landed on the 40 that is the archetype for survival. Well they're nearly halfway there. Twenty two points over their 28 games, that's 30 point pace over the course of the season.\nThen again, those of you familiar with the Premier League will know that it has been a long while since you could go down with 40 to your name, dating back to the \"too good to go down\" West Ham side relegated on 42. Blackpool and Birmingham City fell through the trapdoor on 39 in 2010-11 but since then the mark for survival has been dropping further. An average of the 14 years since would suggest that 34 points would do the trick. In the post-COVID years it has frequently been the case that a number in the high 20s might have you clinging on to Premier League status by your finger nails but Sunderland would doubtless like some breathing room. Let's run with 33 as an end point with which this team could get relegated. How inept would Sunderland have to be to drop into the bottom three? Or indeed does this go beyond inadvertent incompetence and into the world of some misguided version of the Process era Philadelphia 76ers?Well not quite that level. Fifteen points over 28 games equates to a shade under 23 across the course of an entire season. There are 10 teams that have limboed under that particular bar, including two past Sunderland iterations. It is possible to imagine that any newly promoted team could deliver low 20s or worse performances for a long time because, well, a lot of them have. Here's looking at you Sheffield United, Norwich and Ipswich. \nPerhaps there's another way of viewing this, however. What about if something flipped in Sunderland and they became one of the worst teams in Premier League history for the rest of the season? Say they hired Max Bialystock and Leo Bloom as directors of football, benched steady veterans like Granit Xhaka, Reinildo and the excellent Omar Alderete, got really weird with this all. In short, suppose they dropped a Derby County 2007-08, the ignominious 11 point season of such depths that even last season's Southampton couldn't plumb them.If Sunderland accrued points at Derby pace for what is left of the season they would end the campaign on 26. Care to guess where that would have landed them in 2024-25?Seventeenth.This season might well be different. The bottom three is made up of seasoned Premier League sides, the sort who will feel compelled to spend their way out of trouble if they still find themselves in the danger zone come January. They'll hope to drag some stragglers back in but that group probably won't include Sunderland. Their points tally is a generous return from their games so far -- Opta's expected points model has them on 12.5 -- but teams with a -0.14 xGD after 10 games, a smidge below league average, generally aren't going to get dragged into the mire when they've won themselves an 11 point cushion. Sunderland could try to fail from here on out. It might still not be enough to drag them down to the mire.\nPerhaps best not to test that theory though.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NBA's interest in expanding its global reach has been well documented, and it goes beyond just playing preseason and regular season games in various countries. Commissioner Adam Silver has talked about the possibility of starting an NBA Europe league on numerous occasions, but there hasn't been much information beyond the league's interest in getting something off the ground. However, some of the league's plans went public Friday when NBA Europe managing director George Aivazoglou spoke at a conference in Milan, Italy.Silver has mentioned that there's been significant ownership interest from \"a lot of well known wealthy European families, American families and institutions,\" and with the backing of the NBA, it's certainly something that could happen in the near future. Silver previously pointed to 2027 or 2028 as a potential start date, but Aivazoglou said Friday that October 2027 is being targeted as the potential launch date for the league, according to The Associated Press. The current plan for the league consists of 16 teams, 12 of which would be permanent members, Aivazoglou said. Here's a list of the target countries and cities that could get teams, via the AP. Nothing has been formalized by the NBA. Great Britain: London and ManchesterFrance: Paris and LyonSpain: Madrid and BarcelonaItaly: Rome and MilanGermany: Munich and BerlinGreece: AthensTürkiye: IstanbulThe remaining four teams would qualify to join the league by winning either FIBA's Champions League, or based on their performance in their domestic leagues, Aivazoglou said. There have been no deals made with any cities or existing clubs, however, it's been mentioned that several EuroLeague teams would be considered as permanent members, like Spanish powerhouse club Real Madrid.\n\n        \n            \n                NBA commissioner Adam Silver isn't worried about losing talent to European league, but maybe he should be\n                \n                    Jasmyn Wimbish                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAivazoglou said that the first season may not feature all 16 teams as the league gets off the ground, but that is the long-term hope.\"We're well underway in our approach and engagement with the market,\" Aivagolozu said. \"We're having serious discussions with respect to investors.\"Another feature that is being considered with the creation of this league is having NBA teams face some of the European squads.\n\"One of the things that we'll do very soon after we launch this league is probably create a new tournament,\" Aivogolozu said.That tournament could be similar to the FIFA World Cup, but it would differ because players wouldn't necessarily be playing for their home countries.If this league were to get off the ground, it would certainly create some competition for the NBA. Silver's said in the past that he isn't concerned about losing talent to this league, but that doesn't mean it won't happen. It won't be an immediate concern, but perhaps down the line some top international players may consider staying in Europe instead of playing in the NBA in the United States.\nOn paper, this sounds like an exciting new venture for the league, and would be a great representation of how global the sport of basketball really is. There's a record 135 international players on NBA rosters this season, which represents roughly 30% of the total players in the league. This new league would show just how much global interest there is in basketball, and allows the NBA to expand on a level that can only be compared to soccer.\n            ",

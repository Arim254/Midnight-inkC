USC running backs Waymond Jordan and Eli Sanders both exited the game against the Wolverines and didn't return, causing Bryan Jackson -- who hadn't played since Week 1 due to a turf toe injury -- to play.After the game, Riley addressed why Jackson played, citing it was a \"wellness issue\" and that the program was in contact with the league office. Jackson's first carry of the night came midway through the fourth quarter.\"Unique situation,\" Riley said. \"It was a wellness issue obviously in the game. He has been practicing in a very limited capacity in the build up the last several weeks. He had a turf toe. There was the expectation coming into this game that outside of the near catastrophe that we weren't going to play him.\"The game plays out, we have a couple of injuries that you obviously never expect to happen. We were able to get into communication with the league office and explain the situation. Our doctors medically cleared him. Again, it just became a wellness issue for us. We made sure to clear it.\"Jackson finished with five carries for 35 yards and scored a 29-yard rushing touchdown with 4:21 remaining in regulation to extend USC's lead to 18. The running back who got the bulk of the work with Sanders and Jordan out was King Miller, who ran for 156 yards and a touchdown.\nThe Big Ten pregame injury report was introduced in 2023.\n            \n    ",

Oliveira reaffirmed his desire to fight Holloway after submitting Mateusz Gamrot on Saturday. Holloway accepted the callout shortly after UFC Fight Night, and he doesn't want to wait longer than necessary.Heading into Saturday's card, Oliveira told CBS Sports that he wanted a BMF title fight with Holloway next. Holloway responded after \"Do Bronx\" doubled down on his demand.\"I'm interested,\" Holloway said on a Kick live stream. \"Why wouldn't I be?\"We've  been talking about this fight. Me and him have a history. He's blaming  it on some type of injury. I guess we get to figure it out now.\"\nHolloway proposed fighting in March, according to Uncrowned, calling the timeline \"very possible.\" The former UFC featherweight champion and reigning ceremonial BMF titleholder isn't keen to wait until June's planned White House card, but he can't promise a return date yet. Holloway is still recovering from a hand injury suffered in a victorious effort against Dustin Poirier at UFC 318 in July. Holloway isn't medically cleared yet and is only doing strength and conditioning.Oliveira agreed to Holloway's potential terms during Saturday's post-fight press conference.\"It can be at his house. If it's not in Brazil, it can be anywhere in the world...\" Oliveira said through a Portuguese interpreter. \"[March] is perfect. It's a perfect fight.\"  \nHolloway and Oliveira previously fought in 2015, before either became UFC champion. The fight reached an unusual conclusion with Oliveira suffering an esophageal injury 69 seconds into their Fight Night main event. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 Chicago Cubs season has ended after they were eliminated in Game 5 of the NLDS by the NL Central champion Milwaukee Brewers. In some ways, it was a successful year, given that the Cubs made their first full-season playoff round since 2018 and won their first playoff game since 2017, let alone their first playoff series. They won 92 regular-season games, their most since 2018. That marked a nine-game improvement over 2024. The Cubs drew more than 3 million fans to Wrigley for the first time since 2019. On the flip side, there is a bit of an empty feeling that comes with all of that. From April 4-July 20, the Cubs were either in first place or tied for first. They built up a 6 ½-game lead in the middle of June and were fighting for the best record in baseball. Instead, they ended up in a Wild Card Series at home. For much of the summer, this looked like a team that would win its division, get a bye and have a real shot at a deep playoff run, possibly even winning the World Series. Instead, they'll be watching the NLCS from home for the eighth consecutive season while the Brewers advance.Is that acceptable? This isn't a rhetorical question. I'm asking you, Tom Ricketts, Cubs chairman, and Jed Hoyer, Cubs club president. Is being second banana in the Central to the Brewers an acceptable place for your Chicago Cubs?\nConsidering the Cubs' market advantages over the rest of the NL Central -- Chicago is easily the largest market in the division -- and the financial clout that comes with it, it could be argued the Cubs don't flex those muscles as much as they should. They ranked 11th in payroll this season, sitting behind teams like the Padres, Astros and Rangers.It isn't only a matter of spending money, of course, but Hoyer and his front office have done a good job of building up a player-development system. There's an argument that now is the time for the Cubs to spring into action with extra spending to supplement the foundation, not unlike they did leading up to the 2016 World Series title. Let's run through the different pieces of the ballclub and how things look heading to the offseason. \nCatcherSince the departure of Willson Contreras after the 2022 season, the Cubs have had a bad catching situation. That all changed this season, when they ended up with one of the best. It was a group effort, but the only team with more value from behind the plate (by Baseball Reference's positional wins above average) this season was the Mariners. Carson Kelly had a career year in the first season of a two-year deal. Reese McGuire was an admirable fill-in as backup, but he's a non-tender candidate because Miguel Amaya will be counted on next season. Amaya grew greatly in 2024 and was very good when healthy this season. Unfortunately, he was hurt for all but 28 games. Kelly and Amaya should make for a great catcher duo in 2026. Moisés Ballesteros also likely figures in future plans for the Cubs, but it's believed that the team doesn't want him to stay behind the plate, at least not full-time, at least not yet at the big-league level. \nInfieldWe don't need to spend much time here. First baseman Michael Busch is coming off a 34-homer, 4.5-WAR season at age 27 and is under team control through 2029. Second baseman Nico Hoerner is one of the most valuable and underrated players in baseball and is locked up through next season (perhaps an extension should happen this offseason). Shortstop Dansby Swanson is signed through 2029 and coming off another very productive season. Rookie third baseman Matt Shaw struggled in the first half, but he hit .258/.317/.522 in the second half, flashing a great glove at third along with 13 homers, 17 steals and 3.1 WAR on the season. Hoyer can deal with the depth, but the starting infield is set and we can move on.OutfieldThe Cubs overall had a loaded outfield this season, so much so that the DH spot was generally filled by a spare outfielder. They enter the offseason with decisions to make. \nIt starts with Kyle Tucker, who is headed to free agency and will likely get a monster deal (some speculate a lot more, but I think it's reasonable to expect in the $300 million area). He's a star. There have been a few injuries, so let's go with his 162-game averages in his prime that started in 2021: .277/.365/.514 (145 OPS+), 24 doubles, 33 homers, 106 RBI, 98 runs, 6.2 WAR. Again, that's per 162 games. His career high in home runs in a season is 30. His high-water mark in WAR is 5.5 and he posted 4.5 WAR this season. He had a season-crushing slump through July and most of August. He also was a significant part of the offense when it was a juggernaut through June. How much payroll should be tied up in him? I do think it's fair to have concerns about a monster contract for Tucker right now, especially given how much injuries seem to have hampered him the last two years, both in terms of games missed and the impact it had on his production.Ian Happ is only signed through next season at $19 million. He's a good player, but not a star. Though he's streaky within the season, you generally know where his numbers are going to end up. In the last four seasons, he's been between 117 and 120 OPS+ and between 3.5 and 4.3 WAR. \nSeiya Suzuki's contract also runs through next season. He had his best power season with 32 home runs and 103 RBI, but he had a brutal stretch after the All-Star break until the final week of the season and then he got hot again, riding that wave through the playoffs. He's a better overall hitter than Happ, but also an inferior defender. Pete Crow-Armstrong is going to be the Cubs' center fielder for a long time, so we can skip him. The decisions in the outfield come down to the corners. Hoyer could let Tucker walk and run it back with Suzuki in right and Happ in left. That would open up a full-time designated hitter slot for Ballesteros. Then all the spending in the offseason could be on the pitching side and extensions for players like Hoerner and PCA. \nHoyer could also elect to trade Happ and/or Suzuki and then either make a run at Tucker or a different free agent (who hasn't envisioned Kyle Schwarber back at DH?) with the option of giving a shot to youngster Owen Caissie, who showed some decent flashes in his cup of coffee (even though his final line looks bad). There are a lot of options, all of which require firm decisions on Happ and Suzuki, along with the choice on how aggressive to be in bidding on Tucker. It won't be easy, but there are favorable answers in there, given that everyone we're talking about is a good player. It's a lot better than choosing between a bunch of bad players, right? \nRotationCade Horton looked like a frontline starter through most of his rookie season. Matthew Boyd was overall great and is signed through next season with an option for 2027. He ran out of gas in the second half, but next year he'll be better suited to deal with the heavy workload. Shota Imanaga has contract options moving forward and the guess is the Cubs pick those up, despite his major home run problems in the second half and playoffs. Remember, lefty Justin Steele had Tommy John surgery early in the season and will be back next year at some point. Jameson Taillon is signed through next season. That's five starters. They'll need depth, though.Colin Rea has a $6 million player option and he probably elects free agency instead. Still, a reunion with him wouldn't be horrible. He was productive in filling in this season with 27 starts and five relief appearances. Javier Assad is still under team control through 2029 and has shown himself to be a nice back-end rotation guy. \nThings look pretty good here, but there's always room to look for a frontline guy if any become available via trade or if the Cubs decide to pursue a free agent (Framber Valdez, Michael King, Ranger Suárez and Dylan Cease are out there). Imanaga might be cleared via trade to make room if needed, but this all speculative on my part. BullpenBullpens can be pieced together on the cheap and we've seen Hoyer have success taking this path. The Cubs have a few high-octane arms under team control, such as Daniel Palencia and Porter Hodge. Drew Pomeranz, Caleb Thielbar and Brad Keller are free agents, among others. Keller in particular is worth pursuit in the offseason, but it's also possible a team desperate for a closer spends more than the Cubs want to. Andrew Kittredge has a team option at $9 million that could be worth picking up.What's the plan? The team is in really good shape to be ... good. Again. And that's always a plus. But: Will they be great? Are they a World Series champion-type ballclub?\nMaybe.A lot of the offseason will depend on how Hoyer's front office feels about a lot of the younger players and their upside. Then it'll depend on how aggressive he wants to be in going for a World Series title instead of just being a 90ish-win team hoping to have everything fall into place for a World Series run. Part of the reason the Cubs had to do a quick rebuild was because young players didn't live up to expectations in 2019-21. Hoyer doesn't want a repeat of that, so he needs to make sure he correctly judges the young players.My hunch is Hoyer stays in the lane where most of this team remains intact heading to next season with only a few tweaks. The outfield group is the one to watch with Tucker's free agency and possible trade talk about Happ and/or Suzuki.\n            ",

I think this has the potential to be a great series. These are two of the best managed organizations in all of sports. I do think the Dodgers have the edge in terms of elite talent and starting pitching. Where it gets interesting is the bullpens, and Milwaukee undoubtedly has the edge there. It's worth noting, too, that the Brewers went 6-0 in the season series against the Dodgers. Will that prove predictive here? I'm guessing no, but it should be a compelling matchup all the same. Pick: Dodgers in 7\nAxisa: I know the Brewers went 6-0 against the Dodgers in the regular season, but all six games were played in a two-week span in July, and the Dodgers are way healthier and more complete now. I refuse to believe Shohei Ohtani will have another 1 for 18 series at the plate too. He's way too good. The David vs. Goliath narrative is an easy one here even though David had the better regular season record and head-to-head success. I'll hitch my wagon to Goliath this series and say the Dodgers will win, making them the first champion to return to the World Series the next year since the 2008-09 Phillies. Pick: Dodgers in 6McWilliams: Milwaukee keeps finding ways to win, but it's hard to see them beating the Dodgers. L.A. just handled Philly, a team many thought was the best in baseball, and they did it without much offensive help from Shohei Ohtani, which says a lot. If he gets going this round, it could be domination. Pick: Dodgers in 6Perry: The Dodgers are probably better constructed for playoff success, but let's not forget the Brewers during the regular season had more wins and a better run differential against a tougher schedule. I'll also roll the dice and say Brandon Woodruff returns for the NLCS. I think that balanced and deep Brewers lineup will give the Dodgers' setup and middle-relief corps trouble in this series. Pick: Brewers in 7\nSnyder: The Dodgers are more talented, but the Brewers are such a perfect illustration of the saying \"the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.\" The Brewers do all the little things better than anyone else. In this series, the Dodgers will have better starting pitching and more talent on offense, but the Brewers will make fewer defensive and baserunning mistakes. The Brewers will run the bases better and make outstanding defensive plays, too. They'll run out an assembly line of power arms from the bullpen. And people who haven't been watching this team all season will wonder \"who are these guys and how are they this good?\" It just keeps happening and I'm betting on it happening again. Pick: Brewers in 7\n            ",

    "body": "\n        If the season ended today, the Indianapolis Colts would be the No. 1 seed in the playoffs and get the AFC's lone bye week. If someone would have made such a statement in the middle of the summer, a person hearing such a comment would have been within their right to assume that the heat had gotten the better of the person's voicing such a thought.But the reality is that the 4-1 Indianapolis Colts are a team to watch in the fall of 2025. They are coming off a dominant 40-6 win over the Las Vegas Raiders. Their only loss this season came from the Los Angeles Rams, who defeated them 27-20 in Week 4. Aside from that one hiccup, everything has been going Indy's way.Bet Colts vs. Cardinals at Bet365 Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets using the bonus code CBSBET365:The same can not be said of the 2-3 Arizona Cardinals who are mired in a three-game losing streak. And then came news Saturday night that Kyler Murray is expected to be out this week with a foot injury, sources told CBS Sports' NFL insider Jonathan Jones. Jacoby Brissett has been tapped to get the start. Yes, the 2025 Cards appear to be snakebit for outside of injuries, their own odd miscues have paved for their opponents to kick field goals over the last three weeks. Last week, the Tennessee Titans defeated them, 22-21.Here's everything you need to know to watch the game, with betting odds and a prediction for the game.\nWhere to watch Cardinals vs. Colts liveDate: Sunday, Oct. 12 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: Lucas Oil Stadium  -- Indianapolis, IndianaTV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Colts -9.5; O/U 46.5 (via DraftKings)    Cardinals vs. Colts: Need to knowColts are in protection mode. The Colts have done an excellent job at protecting quarterback Daniel Jones. Indy has allowed just four sacks, best in the league. Their 34 yards loss by sacks is the second-best in the league, behind the Denver Broncos.Jonathan Taylor is having a career season. The Colts running back currently leads the league in rushing yards, with 480, ahead of Buffalo Bills' James Cook (450). His 96.0 average yards per game, 94 attempts and six rushing touchdowns are also the most in the league. Taylor is hard to stop and the Colts offensive line is assisting in his success this year, making holes and blocking for him.Will Cardinals get over incident? The Cardinals fined Jonathan Gannon $100,000 for his sideline interacting with running back Emari Demercado during last week's loss. Last week, Demarcado dropped the ball before the end zone to conclude a 72-yard run, causing a touchback for the Titans rather than a touchdown for the Cardinals. A clearly frustrated Gannon looked like he made contact with Demarcado and later apologized for the incident, saying he \"didn't feel great about it.\"\nCardinals vs. Colts prediction, pick\nThe Cardinals have lost a lot of close games this season, but I don't think this one will be close. I think the Colts can expose some of the issues the Cardinals have and find the end zone often. Pick: Colts -9.5; Over 46.5\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Through the first five weeks of the season, seven teams possess a record of 4-1. And of those seven, the San Francisco 49ers and Tampa Bay Buccaneers have had particularly interesting paths towards being tied for the best record in the league.Despite injuries they have suffered to rob them of star power, the 49ers have managed to go 4-1 following their tried and true formula under coach Kyle Shanahan, but this time with a different quarterback: With a toe injury having sidelined Brock Purdy, Mac Jones has stepped into the starting role and revitalized his own career, leading the 49ers to three wins that have allowed them to take the top spot in the NFC West after a Thursday Night win over the Los Angeles Rams.Bet Buccaneers vs. 49ers at BetMGM Sportsbook, where new users get up to $1,500 in bonus bets back if their first wager doesn't win with the promo code CBSSPORTS:The Buccaneers, meanwhile, have gotten to 4-1 by putting the ball in their leader's hands when the chips are down and letting him do his thing. In each of the Buccaneers' four wins this year, quarterback Baker Mayfield has managed to drive his team down the field when he's needed to most, and each time he has cashed in and put his team in the win column. He did it again in a 38-35 win on the road in Seattle a week ago, and now it's up to Mayfield and the Bucs to defend their turf in against a similarly unrelenting 49ers team.\nWhere to watch 49ers vs. Buccaneers liveWhen: Sunday, Oct. 12 | Time: 4:25 p.m. ETWhere: Raymond James Stadium -- Tampa, FloridaTV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Odds: Buccaneers -3.5; O/U 47.5 (via DraftKings)Follow: CBS Sports App49ers vs. Buccaneers: Need to knowIt's still time for some Mac-tion. With Brock Purdy continuing to deal with a toe injury, the 49ers' saving grace has been the fact that Mac Jones -- formerly cast off by the New England Patriots -- has fit their offense like a glove. Jones is in line to start yet again against the Buccaneers, and he is coming off of a win against the Los Angeles Rams in which he threw for 342 yards and two touchdowns. Jones has kept San Francisco's offense running right on schedule, and it has yet again proved tough for any defense in football to defend -- particularly when Jones has been running it, as he has won all three of his starts to date.The NFL's king of clutch. Baker Mayfield has earned the right to be put squarely in the NFL's MVP conversation in large part thanks to his late-game heroics. Mayfield's flair for the dramatic was on display yet again last week, as he had to cap off a performance where he went 29-for-33 passing for 379 yards by leading his team down the field to win the game in the final minutes, giving Tampa Bay come-from-behind victories in all four of their wins this season. Mayfield has become one of the most compelling figures in the NFL, as his impeccable performance in the clutch has backed up his brash and ever confident demeanor.\n49ers vs. Buccaneers prediction, pick\nThe Buccaneers are currently favored in this matchup at -3.5, and I'm hard pressed to go against that considering all that they have continually shown throughout the season so far in being able to win close games. The 49ers are no pushover no matter who their quarterback is, and Jones' success has shown that Kyle Shanahan's offense has all the answers to any defense as long as it is run by a quarterback that can process  things relatively quickly. But what a system can't bring out of a  quarterback is the ability to pluck their hairs out of their chest and  lead their team to victory even when the chips are down late in the  game. Mayfield keeps doing it, and you've got to feel like he'll be posed to do it again. Pick: Bucs -3.5; Over 47.5\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Denver Broncos (3-2) and the New York Jets (0-5) are ready to do battle in a 2025 NFL London Game in NFL Week 6. Bo Nix and the Broncos enter Week 6 on the heels of their second straight victory, ending the Eagles unbeaten streak with a 21-17 come-from-behind win in Philadelphia. Meanwhile, Justin Fields and the Jets continue their quest to get into the win column, most recently giving up 20 second-quarter points to the Dallas Cowboys in a 37-22 loss.Kickoff from Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is set for 9:30 a.m. ET. Denver is a 7.5-point favorite in the latest Broncos vs. Jets odds, and the over/under for total points scored is 43.5.

The run defense has been solid through five weeks and only allowed 45 rushing yards to Philadelphia, so the Broncos should have their work cut out for them against the Breece Hall-led Jets run game. Nix came up big in the fourth quarter against the Eagles and exited Philadelphia without throwing a pick -- a big confidence boost ahead of the Broncos' tenth international game. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Jets can coverNew York has covered the spread twice this season and their best shot at keeping Sunday's game close -- if not ending their winless skid -- is to keep hammering away on the ground. Hall has a team-leading 305 rushing yards and Fields adds 204 yards of his own. The 26-year-old quarterback finished Week 5 32-for-46 for 283 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions, but he will need to connect with Garrett Wilson and the receiving corps much earlier than the fourth quarter if the Jets are going to keep Denver from running away with the game. See which team to back at SportsLine. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to make Jets vs. Broncos  picksFor the NFL London Game in Week 6, the model is leaning under the total, and also says one side of the spread hits in more than 50% of simulations. See what it is at SportsLine.Who wins Broncos vs. Jets, and which side of the spread hits more than 50% of the time?

The Brewers advanced to their first NLCS since 2018 when they defeated the Chicago Cubs in Game 5 of their NLDS matchup to take the best-of-five series by a 3-2 margin. Milwaukee will now face the Los Angeles Dodgers for the opportunity to represent the Senior Circuit in this year's World Series.Whereas the Dodgers are making their fourth NLCS appearance in six years, the Brewers have reached this stage just twice since moving to the NL in 1998: back in 2018 (when they met the Dodgers) and in 2011, when they were knocked off by the St. Louis Cardinals. The Dodgers are attempting to become MLB's first repeat World Series champions since the New York Yankees won three in a row in 1998-2000.Dodgers vs. Brewers scheduleDateStart time/scoreTVLive streamGame 1Mon., Oct. 138:08 p.m ETTBSfuboGame 2Tue., Oct. 148:08 p.m ETTBSfuboGame 3Thur., Oct. 16TBDTBSfuboGame 4Fri., Oct. 17TBDTBSfuboGame 5 (if nec.)Sat., Oct. 18TBDTBSfuboGame 6 (if nec.)Mon., Oct. 20TBDTBSfuboGame 7 (if nec.)Tue., Oct. 21TBDTBSfuboDodgers vs. Brewers: Game 1 infoTime: 8:08 p.m. ET | Date: Mon., Oct. 13Location: American Family Field -- MilwaukeeTV channel: TBS | Live stream: HBO MaxStarting pitchers: RHP Shohei Ohtani (LAD) vs. TBA (MIL)Odds: Dodgers -151, Brewers +124 (via DraftKings)NLCS storylinesDodgers: As noted in the introduction, the Dodgers are seeking to become MLB's first repeat World Series champion since the Yankees won three in a row back in 1998-2000. The Dodgers' road here included series victories against the Cincinnati Reds and Philadelphia Phillies. During the regular season, the Dodgers went 0-6 against the Brewers and were outscored by a 15-run margin. Of course, the Dodgers would point out that all of those games occurred in a small window in July, Brewers: The Brewers, by virtue of having the best record in all of MLB, earned a first-round bye and home-field advantage throughout the postseason. That means they'll host four games if this goes seven. Additionally, it means that their series against the Cubs represented their first action of the playoffs. The Brewers are looking for their first pennant in either league since 1982.\nSeries predictionjThis should be a great series between two of the best managed organizations in sports. I picked the Dodgers to win the World Series, meaning I'm obligated to choose them here. That isn't meant as disrespect to the Brewers -- it wouldn't register as a surprise if MLB's best team during the regular season took this series -- it just means I owe it to everyone to be consistent with these things. Hence: Dodgers in seven.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        DALLAS -- Texas quarterback Arch Manning has been saddled with immense expectations from the first time he arrived on campus, from No. 1 recruit to preseason Heisman favorite.But playing in one of the nation's signature rivalries against No. 6 Oklahoma, he dominated by excelling with the details. Manning's final stat line was relatively pedestrian -- 21-of-27 for 166 yards and a touchdown. But unlike the first few weeks, where Manning was asked to drop bombs downfield, his playmaking ability in the intermediate range was put to the test. Playing against an Oklahoma defense that ranks No. 1 in the nation in several categories, the Longhorns knew that Manning would be under duress. The first few weeks, Manning has held onto the ball longer than almost any other quarterback in the Power Four. With potential All-Americans David Stone and R. Mason Thomas on the other side, getting the ball out quick was a priority. \"Arch can make every throw in the book,\" wide receiver DeAndre Moore said. \"It's really about what the defense is giving us. They played a lot of deep coverage and Arch took advantage of that. It was a really great game plan.\" \nManning was pinpoint to start the game, hitting 8-of-9 passes for 52 yards. Many of the passes were screens or slants, but Manning wasn't hitting them early in the year. His accuracy and mechanics looked much improved. Eventually, the pressure did come for Manning. The Sooners posted five tackles for loss over the course of a quarter. Instead of running, Texas coach Steve Sarkisian trusted him to create opportunities. Manning soon started buying time with his legs and finding receivers on intermediate crossing routes to keep drives alive. \"He did a nice job,\" Oklahoma coach Brent Venables said. \"We lost contain a few times to allow him to buy some time. And he's a good player with good skill guys around him. He played with really good poise and made some good plays in tight coverage.\" \nThird down kingTexas was stifled on its first few drives by the Oklahoma defense, especially as a few young offensive linemen struggled to acclimate. But midway through the second quarter, Manning started taking over at a particular moment: third down. \"I think being able to stay out of third and long and get more reasonable third downs,\" Manning said of their success. \"Offensive line did a hell of a job and playmakers made plays. That's what it's all about.\" Looking back at the numbers, though, Manning's mettle was stark. From the middle of the second quarter on, Manning faced 11 times third downs. Those plays averaged a distance to gain of 6.7 yards, an obvious passing situation -- the type Oklahoma's defense feasts on. \nManning was electric in those sequences, completing 8-of-9 passes for 105 yards and adding two carries for 35 yards. The highlight was a 12-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver DeAndre Moore on third-and-8. His 26-yard scamper ending in a slide was a game-ending play, and he waved goodbye to the crowd. \"He proved today, he's a great quarterback and we're all behind him,\" wide receiver Parker Livingstone said. \"He's the leader of this team and the leader of this offense.\" The Texas efforts on third down completely transformed the heavyweight battle. The Longhorns strung together drives of 12 plays, 14 plays and 13 plays as they built a 13-6 lead in the fourth quarter. The weight later stacked onto Oklahoma, which allowed a 75-yard punt return to Ryan Niblett that was the closing statement. \n\"I think so much is made about Arch,\" Sarkisian said. \"When we don't win, it's his fault, when we do win, everybody praise Arch. We're the team and Arch will be the first to tell you that. He's an awesome teammate.\" Handling the momentThrough the first five games, Texas ranked among the worst teams nationally on third down. The Longhorns ranked No. 116, converting on only 34% of third downs. In the 29-21 loss to Florida, Texas went 3-of-11 on third down, with Manning completing just 3-of-7 passes on those key downs. Many of the struggles have come down to his footwork and technique in these key moments. Passes have fallen into the dirt, especially in the middle of the field. Against Oklahoma, Texas saw a more relaxed Manning that handled himself well in key moments. \nHeading into the matchup, Manning was completing only 46.7% of passes when under pressure with four touchdowns and three interceptions. Against Oklahoma, he jumped up to 58.3% completion. His average depth of target on those passes was 15.9 yards in the first few games, but went down to 5.8 against Oklahoma as he grew more comfortable taking advantage of underneath routes. Texas doesn't need Manning to carry the offense. Consistency is enough. Manning's performance doesn't fix all of Texas's issues, but it does give them a second life. The Longhorns move to 4-2, and 1-1 in SEC play. Even with AP Top 10 games against No. 5 Texas A&M and No. 10 Georgia on the docket, the Longhorns still face one of the easiest paths among the SEC contenders. Losing to Oklahoma would have been a death sentence for the Longhorns' season. Now, thanks to Arch, they have second life. \n\"We won the conference a year ago in the regular season by going 7-1 in conference play,\" Sarkisian said. \"If we can play the way we played today, we're plenty good enough to compete with any team in our conference.\" \n            ",

But to reach this point in the playoffs, it takes more than simply being a winning driver and a winning race team. By making it to the Round of 8, eight drivers and teams have exhibited that they were among the very finest in all of auto racing and deserve the right to try and get to NASCAR's finale with a shot at winning the Cup Series championship. Now, it's a matter of taking advantage of that right.With four races to go in the season, the Round of 8 of the NASCAR playoffs begins with the first opportunity for the remaining playoff drivers to win a race and make the Championship 4 coming this weekend in the South Point 400 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. Of the eight remaining drivers in the playoffs, one in particular knows exactly what this race can do for him. In 2022 and again last year, Joey Logano won this race to earn his Championship 4 berth, which he seized upon both times to win at Phoenix and win the Cup championship.\n        \n            \n                NASCAR playoffs 2025 race schedule, results: Complete list of Cup Series race dates, winners, tracks\n                \n                    Steven Taranto                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHaving been the last driver to make the Round of 8 on points, the defending champ's presence in the penultimate round of the playoffs looms large over the rest of the field. And for Denny Hamlin, Ryan Blaney, Kyle Larson, William Byron, Christopher Bell, Chase Briscoe and Chase Elliott, the pressure is on to strike first before Logano gets the opportunity to spoil their hopes of taking his crown.Where to watch the NASCAR playoffs at Las VegasWhen: Sunday, Oct. 12 | Time: 5:30 p.m. ETWhere: Las Vegas Motor Speedway -- Las VegasTV: USA | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)   Starting lineupDenny Hamlin won the pole for the South Point 400 in qualifying on Saturday, posting a lap of 29.213 (184.849 MPH) to lead a Joe Gibbs Racing 1-2-3 sweep of the front three spots.

Yeley#78 - Katherine LeggeStoryline to watchDespite major efforts being taken to stamp out playoff race manipulation after the finish to last year's Martinsville elimination race, the finish to last week's race at the Charlotte Roval saw team and OEM orders yet again play a factor in the battle for the final spot above the cut line to advance to the Round of 8. In the hours that followed the finish and Joey Logano's triumph over Ross Chastain in the cut line battle, radio communications on both Cole Custer and Alex Bowman's teams while they were trailing Logano and Bowman respectively were the subject of examination and heavy questioning.\nAfter Custer followed Logano -- a fellow Ford -- through traffic and made one attempt to pass him with four laps to go, Custer's spotter Andy Houston was heard being asked if he had his \"watch on\" after Custer crossed the start/finish line to take three laps to go. At that point, a message of \"nice and easy\" was relayed to Custer, with the directive to try and save his tires in case of a late-race restart.While the optics of the radio communications relative to the situation made it seem as though Custer was receiving orders to stand down and not pass Logano, there was at least some plausible deniability inherent in Haas Factory Team's messaging. The messaging over Alex Bowman's radio was slightly more clumsy, as he was reminded to save his tires -- on the final lap -- the moment he got to Ross Chastain's bumper to challenge him for position. Bowman never seriously challenged Chastain for position from that point onward, instead leaving a comfortable gap between his car and the fellow Chevrolet of Chastain.\nSpeaking on Hauler Talk this week, NASCAR's Mike Forde shared that officials felt that neither the No. 41 or No. 48 team's radio communications rose to the level that a penalty was necessary. However, NASCAR does plan to meet with teams this week in the leadup to the race at Las Vegas to remind them that race manipulation and particularly blatant actions by teams and/or manufacturers to ensure that their drivers advance to the Championship 4 will not be tolerated.\"At a certain point during this week, we will just remind teams if they need a reminder 'let's not put yourselves or ourselves in jeopardy here,'\" Forde said. \"Fans should be coming to the racetrack and expecting a straight up race where each position is fought for as hard as possible, especially at the end of a race. If we do see something or hear something we don't like, we are going to step in... So we are aware, and I think come this week -- Vegas and Talladega maybe not as much so, but certainly Martinsville we'll be on high alert again. And if we hear something, we will certainly react if necessary.\"As a result of last year's Martinsville cutoff race -- which saw NASCAR suspend nine and hand out $600k in fines after multiple teams tried to manipulate the outcome of the battle for the final Championship 4 spot between Christopher Bell and William Byron -- NASCAR has been much more vigilant in monitoring team actions and communications in this year's playoffs. For instance, NASCAR officials warned two Xfinity Series teams -- both of which had already advanced to the Round of 8 -- not to discuss the points scenarios for teams that had yet to advance over their team radios, as had happened in last week's elimination race in Charlotte.\nExactly where each playoff contender stands relative to the cut line on points likely won't be as much of a factor in the opening race of the Round of 8 at Las Vegas, but it certainly will be worth monitoring in the final two before the Championship 4 is settled.NASCAR news of the weekJudge Kenneth Bell has ordered NASCAR, 23XI Racing and Front Row Motorsports to participate in a settlement conference on Oct. 21, a move which comes shortly after NASCAR asked the Western District Court of North Carolina to order the parties to participate in a judicial settlement conference. The move opens up the possibility of the teams' ongoing antitrust lawsuit against the sanctioning body being settled before it is set to go to trial on Dec. 1. Representatives for 23XI and Front Row, however, accused NASCAR's request for a settlement conference of being \"another effort to play to the court of public opinion\" and not an effort toward resolution.NASCAR officially announced this week that they will be increasing horsepower in 2026, moving from 670 to 750 HP for Cup Series cars at all ovals less than 1.5 miles and all road courses. The full list of tracks that will see a power increase include Bowman Gray Stadium, Circuit of the Americas, Phoenix Raceway,  Darlington Raceway, Martinsville Speedway, Bristol Motor Speedway,  Watkins Glen International, Dover Motor Speedway, Nashville  Superspeedway, San Diego Street Course, Sonoma Raceway, North Wilkesboro  Speedway, Iowa Speedway, Richmond Raceway, New Hampshire Motor  Speedway, World Wide Technology Raceway and Charlotte Motor Speedway  Road Course. AM Racing announced that Harrison Burton will not return to their Xfinity Series team in 2026, ending a one-year run that came after Burton returned to the Xfinity level following three seasons in Cup. In one season with AM Racing, Burton earned two top fives, 10 top 10s, and made the playoffs before being eliminated at the end of the Round of 12.Finalists for the Comcast Community Champion of the Year award, the most prestigious annual award honoring philanthropic efforts of those across the NASCAR industry, have been announced. This year's finalists include former NASCAR Xfinity Series director Wayne Auton (The Corner Table), Bristol Motor Speedway general manager Jerry Caldwell (Speedway Children's Charities, Bristol chapter), and NASCAR Xfinity Series driver Daniel Dye (Race to Stop Suicide).Pick to winChristopher Bell (+500 at DraftKings) -- The past two years in a row, this race has served as Christopher Bell's stumbling block on his way to trying to win a Cup championship. In both 2023 and 2024, Bell finished a narrow second, and last year was particularly painful in that Bell had dominated the entire race only to lose to Joey Logano on strategy, a loss which ended up having massive consequences when Bell fell apart at Martinsville and missed the Championship 4 entirely.Bell has found himself in a big spot in both of his last two Vegas starts, as he entered the spring race looking to win four in a row after rattling off three straight wins at the start of the year. Bell ended up only running 12th, and his Bristol win a month ago has been his lone victory since his hot streak to begin the year. But with five top 10s in a row including consecutive third-place finishes, it appears the time is nigh for Bell to claim a Championship 4 spot and potentially the Cup championship he missed out on a year ago.\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                                            ",

Murray missed practice on Wednesday and Thursday, but he returned in a limited capacity on Friday. Despite that progress, Murray is expected to be unavailable in Week 6.Murray suffered the foot injury in the Cardinals' Week 5 loss to the Tennessee Titans, and it has hampered him all week. With Murray sidelined, veteran quarterback Jacoby Brissett will step into the starting role. The last time Brissett started a game was just over a year ago on Oct. 6, 2024 when he was a member of the New England Patriots. In that game, a 15-10 loss to the Miami Dolphins, Brissett completed 18 of his 34 pass attempts for 160 yards.The Cardinals are looking to bounce back from a horrific loss to the Titans in which they blew a 21-3 lead, including a 15-point lead in the fourth quarter. After that stunning defeat, Murray was in disbelief.\n\"I don't really know what to think about that,\" Murray said. \"I don't even know. I really don't even know. That's 'How to Lose a Game 101.' I don't know. That was crazy.\"Prior to his injury, Murray was completing 68.3% of his throws for 962 yards, six touchdowns and three interceptions. He had also rushed for 173 yards and a score.\nMurray's injury only adds to the issues Arizona has in its backfield. Starting running back James Conner was lost for the season with an ankle injury in Week 3, and backup Trey Benson was placed on injured reserve after getting injured in Week 4. Last week, Michael Carter got the bulk of the work at running back, and that should continue on Sunday.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Following a second straight upset as a heavy favorite -- and a third consecutive loss overall -- Penn State is reeling and coach James Franklin is facing questions about his future. He was asked directly about what lies ahead for him in State College after his team's 22-21 home loss to Northwestern on Saturday.One week after giving UCLA its first win of the season, Penn State laid an egg at home against Northwestern. The Nittany Lions are now just the fifth team since 1950 to start 3-3 after being ranked in the top two of the preseason poll.\n        \n            \n                James Franklin buyout: What it would cost Penn State to fire struggling coach after ugly loss to Northwestern\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDue to his massive $56 million buyout, Franklin has some degree of security, but this can only continue for so long before Penn State makes a move. In his postgame press conference, Franklin deflected attention to his players when asked about his future with the Nittany Lions.\"For me, it's always been about our players, and those guys are hurting right now,\" Franklin said. \"The fans are frustrated, and I totally get it. We have great fans here. We get unbelievable support. I understand their frustration. Trust me. We're as frustrated as anybody, the guys in the locker room.\"But to me, ultimately, it's about the guys. It's about the guys in the locker room, and they're hurting in there. And I'd do anything I could to take that hurt away from them. But like I told them, we've got to stick together. We've got to tune out all the noise, and we've got to get to work. That's the only answer, is get to work. We've had some adversity in the past, not like this, and we're going to get to work.\"Franklin expressed his commitment to the players, saying they have been his focus throughout his entire coaching career.\"I love those kids,\" Franklin said. \"I am committed to those players in that locker room, and I've been that way for 12 years. I've been that way for 15 years of my head coaching career, and I've been that way for 30 years. That won't change. It's always been about the players for me; that won't ever change. That's what it's all about for me. So my commitment is to the guys in that locker room and all the guys that have been in that locker room in the past. That's where my commitment is.\"James Franklin: 'We shouldn't lose that game'As things have spiraled out of control in Happy Valley, Franklin and his coaching staff have tried to insulate the players from the outside criticism. As the volume on that noise cranks up, Franklin acknowledged that it's probably had some impact on the team.\n\"We have worked really hard to keep the building as positive as we possibly can and close out all that noise,\" Franklin said. \"But for me to say that it doesn't impact them would not be honest.\"If things keep going this way, the Nittany Lions may have to scratch and claw just to reach bowl eligibility. Franklin made it clear whatever issues are plaguing Penn State right now must get corrected, and said he will be the one to fix them.\"We shouldn't lose that game,\" Franklin said. \"It's 100% on me, and we have to get it fixed, and I will get it fixed.\"\nThings won't get any easier for Franklin and Penn State in the coming weeks. The next three games include road trips to Iowa and Ohio State, as well as a home game against Indiana.To top it all off, the Nittany Lions will have to face that gauntlet without starting quarterback Drew Allar, who was lost for the season with a leg injury in the fourth quarter.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Sunday is a pivotal game for the Steelers and Browns, though for vastly different reasons. For Pittsburgh, Sunday is a chance to possibly extend its lead over the rest of the field in the AFC North standings. At 3-1, the Steelers will enter Sunday's game with a 1.5-game lead over second-place Bengals. Given that Cincinnati is a 14-point underdog at Green Bay, the Steelers figure to likely emerge from the Week 6 with even greater separation in the division with a win over Cleveland. Bet Browns vs. Steelers at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:At 1-4, the Browns need a win if they want to increase their odds of still playing meaningful football by month's end. While their record isn't good, a win could go a long way for the Browns, given the current state of fellow division foes Cincinnati (2-3) and Baltimore (1-4). \nRecords aside, Sunday's game is a matchup of two historic rivals who simply don't like each other. If nothing else, expect a physical game that has become a trademark of AFC North football. Here's how you can follow the action in real time, along with a breakdown and a prediction for Sunday. Where to watch Browns vs. Steelers liveWhen: Sunday, Oct. 12 | Time: 1 p.m. ETWhere: Acrisure Stadium -- Pittsburgh, PennsylvaniaTV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Steelers -5.5; O/U 38.5 (via FanDuel)Browns vs. Steelers: Need to know It'll be a road debut for Gabriel. Sunday will be the first regular season road start for Browns rookie quarterback Dillon Gabriel. In his first start (which was played in London), the third-round pick had a solid game, going 19 of 33 for 190 yards and two touchdowns in a 21-17 loss to the Vikings. \nNo more Joe. Last year, the Steelers lost to the Colts after Joe Flacco replaced injured starter Anthony Richardson. There's no chance history will repeat itself on Sunday after the Browns traded Flacco to the Bengals earlier this week. What about Shedeur? If something were to happen to Gabriel, the Browns' quarterback options are rookie Shedeur Sanders and veteran Bailey Zappe, who promoted from the practice squad after Flacco was traded. Sanders has yet to attempt a pass in a regular season game. Zappe does has a win over the Steelers on his resume, a 21-18 victory during the 2023 season as a member of the Patriots. Zappe went 19 for 28 for 240 yards in three touchdowns in that game. A surprising trade. The Browns' second surprise trade when down on Wednesday night when the news broke that they were trading Greg Newsome II and a 2026 sixth-round pick to the Jaguars in exchange for fellow cornerback Tyson Campbell and a 2026 seventh-round pick. Unless Campbell learns the Browns' defense extremely quickly, Newsome's replacement for Sunday will likely be Myles Harden, a 2024 seventh-round pick who has already made three starts this season. \nTomlin's dominance facing rookie QBs. Saying that Mike Tomlin's teams have historically played well against rookie quarterbacks would be a massive understatement. Under Tomlin, the Steelers are 26-6 against rookie quarterbacks. Two of those losses, however, were against the Browns, with the most recent loss occurring in 2023 when Dorian Thompson-Robinson led the Browns to an upset win in Cleveland. The rivalry within the rivalry. Sunday's game will feature two of the NFL's best pass rushers in 2017 first-round picks Myles Garrett and T.J. Watt. Their rivalry went to another level the last two years, with Garrett proclaiming himself as the league's premier pass rusher last year after the Browns upset the Steelers in Week 12. Garrett's comments came after Watt posted a passive-aggressive message on social media after Garrett was chosen over him as the 2023 Defensive Player of the Year. Browns vs. Steelers prediction, pick \nTurnovers appear to be the Browns' best chance of pulling off an upset. If the Steelers take care of the ball, minimize Cleveland's rushing attack (led by rookie Quinshon Judkins) and get their own running game going, Pittsburgh should be able to take care of business while getting its first home win of the 2025 season. Pick: Steelers -5.5, Under 38.5\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The first two rounds of the 2025 MLB postseason are complete and four  teams are still standing. It will be the Seattle Mariners and Toronto Blue Jays in the ALCS, guaranteeing one very long pennant drought will end. In the NLCS, the Los Angeles Dodgers will take on the Milwaukee Brewers as they look to become baseball's first repeat champion since the 1998-2000 New York Yankees.  MLB  hands out two (really three) awards each the  postseason: World  Series  MVP and one MVP for each of the two  Championship Series. There  is  nothing to recognize the best player in  the Wild Card Series or   Division Series though, and we're here to  right that wrong. Here are our hypothetical Wild Card Series MVPs and now here are our Division Series MVPs.   \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n      Blue Jays vs. Yankees: Vladimir Guerrero Jr.  Poor Ernie Clement. He went 9 for 14 (.643) and barely got consideration for our hypothetical ALDS MVP. Depending on who won the series, it was going to either Vlad Jr. or Aaron Judge, so Guerrero it is. He tormented the Yankees, going 9 for 17 (.529) with three home runs and 9 RBI in the four games. Guerrero's Game 2 grand slam will go down as a signature Toronto postseason moment.  How good was Vlad Jr.'s ALDS? He entered this year as a career .136/.240/.182 hitter in six postseason games. That's now up to .308/.378/.564 in 10 postseason games. Guerrero led all players in the series in championship probability added (by a lot) and also win probability added (by not as much). The Blue Jays gave him $500 million to do exactly this. He was a monster in the ALDS.  \n\"It means a lot to me,\" Guerrero said after the clinching Game 4 win. \"We're going to the next round, to the Championship Series, and that's my focus, and it means a lot.\"  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n      Brewers vs. Cubs: Andrew Vaughn  The first ever Brewers vs. Cubs postseason series was awfully compelling. Chicago forced a Game 5 after dropping Games 1 and 2, and there were heroes abound. Jackson Chourio drove in three runs in each Game 1 and 2. Jacob Misiorowski allowed one run in seven innings in his two appearances. Rookie Chad Patrick got big outs in high leverage situations all series.  We're going to give NLDS MVP to Vaughn because I dig home runs, and he hit two big ones in the NLDS. His three-run shot in the first inning of Game 2 was an underrated huge moment. The Brewers were down 3-0 early, and Vaughn punched right back. Make an out there and that game -- and the series -- could have played out very differently. Vaughn also hit the go-head homer in Game 5.  \nAll told, Vaughn went 4 for 14 (.286) with the two home runs in the NLDS, which might've been the two biggest hits of the series. He led all players in the series in championship probably added and not by a little either. The Brewers got him from the White Sox in a minor trade in June. A few months later, Vaughn is making an impact in the postseason. Baseball, man.  \"It's just being where my feet are,\" Vaughn said before Game 5 about his success with the Brewers. \"Life can be crazy.  Baseball as a  profession can be crazy, but really just whittle it down to taking it  one pitch at a time, be exactly where my feet are and enjoy every moment  of it.\"\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n      Dodgers vs. Phillies: Roki Sasaki  This series will forever be remembered as the Orion Kerkering error series, which is unfortunate because it was four terrific games between two pretty evenly matched teams. Teoscar Hernández has a good argument for NLDS MVP thanks to his game-flipping three-run homer in Game 1. Tyler Glasnow and Blake Snell too given their dominant performances.  \nThe pick here has to be Sasaki though. He's emerged as a game-changing force as a reliever. Sasaki saved Game 1, entered with runners on the corners and a one-run lead to save Game 2, then threw three perfect innings in the Game 4 win. He faced 14 batters in his three appearances and allowed just one baserunner, all in supremely high-leverage situations.  Just how impactful was Sasaki in the NLDS? He led all players in the series in championship probability added by a healthy margin despite throwing only 4 ⅓ innings. The 13 outs he recorded were that important to the outcome of the series. After a rough and injury-interrupted start to his MLB career earlier this year, he's become a difference-making bullpen weapon for the Dodgers.  \"You're talking about one of the great all-time appearances out of the  pen that I can remember,\" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said after Game 4. \"Certainly given where he started this year,  what he is as a starting pitcher, to go out there and not only go one  inning, two innings and then three innings, and to do what he did gave  us a huge boost. I can't speak enough to his growth and his contribution to this  club.  We're starting to see something really special in him.\"  \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n      Mariners vs. Tigers: Cal Raleigh  You could make a pretty good argument that, even in defeat, Kerry Carpenter deserves ALDS MVP. He hit two very important home runs and was clearly the guy the Mariners were most afraid to face. As good as Carpenter was, I don't think he was \"MVP despite being on the losing team\" good, so we have to go with someone else. That someone else is Raleigh.  Seattle's 60-homer backstop went 8 for 21 (.381) with a homer and four walks in the ALDS, which is a .480 on-base percentage. He drove in three runs in the pivotal Game 3 win, which gave Seattle a 2-1 series lead and the wiggle room to continue playing after the Game 4 loss. Plus, Raleigh caught 15 innings in Game 5. I'm sure he was feeling it in his legs the next day.  Andrés Muñoz deserves a mention here as well. He pitched four times in the five games, did not allow a hit, and retired 15 of the 17 batters he faced. Also, Muñoz made his first two-inning appearance since 2019 in Game 1, and got four outs in Game 5. Really, the entire Mariners pitching staff should win ALDS MVP. They had a 3.29 ERA in 52 innings.  \n\"It takes everybody in a game like this,\" Mariners manager Dan Wilson said after the 15-inning win in Game 5. \"... We've talked about the fight all year long.  To go 15  innings tonight, 15 rounds, so to speak, and to come out on top, that  sure feels good.\"  \n            ",
